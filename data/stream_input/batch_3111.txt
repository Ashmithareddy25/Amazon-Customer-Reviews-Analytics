B009LA1QW6|5.0|Being a HUGE Lana Del Rey fan a will gobble up anything of hers. Especially this album. It may be short, but it has class and soul. I love all the songs on this album with their seductive and catchy melodies; loud/soft fast/slow downbeats; and poetic, emotional lyrics. And Lana's voice is incredible. How is she not really famous already! LOVE this album!
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|This book is great. It makes me laugh and it also makes me feel like there's someone out there who knows what I'm going through. I have found the voice who has described a lot of my same thoughts and feelings. I know I'm not good at writing and I can never find the right words to describe what I'm going through, but Allie has described it perfectly. I feel like we're twins separated at birth.<br /><br />Thank you, Allie, for sharing your stories. You are an extremely talented person.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|This CD offers a lot of variety and sounds much different from a lot of her other work. I like it, especially blaring it in my car, great CD I can listen to straight through.
B004P4O87I|5.0|I bought this for a friend's 7 y/o boy. He opened it at his party, about midway through the gifts. When he saw the box he actually screamed. He jumped up and down while shouting for a good 3 minutes, much longer than any of the other gifts, although he was quite grateful for everything he opened. Then, after cake, it was the first box he tore into, and he really didn't join the rest of the party. Maybe this kid is extra into Starwars, but if that's your kid/grandchild too, this will be a hit. The price is steep, but this was the cheapest way to get the coveted \\"Commander Cody\\". I would buy it again.

B00F3VOL38|5.0|It seems like almost every year as Christmas season is about to start they come out with some kind of new Beatles album. Something like a remaster of their albums or rare recordings that had been kept hidden away for years. This year the offering is \\"On Air- Live At The BBC Volume 2\\". It is I guess you would call a follow up to their first \\"Live At The BBC\\" album that was released twenty years ago or so. In any event for those of us who are serious fans of The Beatles this is a must to add to our Beatles collection.<br /><br />As with the first album this is a collection of live performances the Beatles made on BBC radio from around 1962 to 1965. It covers that time in their career when Beatlemania was catching on in England and as the the Lads were preparing to cross the great pond to captivate America. This is the roots of The Beatles music as they were developing their song writing style and sound. They sound fresh and energetic and happy as they are playing their music. This was a time when they enjoyed touring and playing live music before the constant strain and hassles of touring began to wear them down to the point they would finally give up playing concerts and find refuge by going into the recording studio to just make music.<br /><br />The music on Volume 2 is a collection of both The Beatles playing cover versions of other peoples songs as well as performing their own. The sound quality of the music on both discs are excellent with only one or two not quite up to par but still enjoyable to hear. Like with the first volume there is an excellent booklet included that gives a run down on the music being played as well as pictures of John, Paul, George and Ringo. Plus in addition to the songs there are through out the two discs moments of the boys talking either with the announcer of the show they were on or just reading things off of cards that help to show off the wit and charm that all four of The Beatles were known for. There is no doubt I am sure for the listener who is old enough to remember Beatlemania will be nostalgic as they listen to the songs being performed and Lads as they talk. Do know for those readers of this review who have the first BBC album you will notice there are song titles on Volume 2 that are also on Volume 1. These songs however are not repeat recordings. All of the music performed on Volume 2 are different performances from the first album. So get your copy now or add it to you Christmas wish list but for any serious fan of the Beatles this is an album you will want to get.e listener who is old enough to remember Beatlemania will be nostalgic as they listen to the songs being performed and Lads as they talk.

B001ILFUDM|2.0|No spanish Dub only the special features disc why? its stupid the special features disc have another audio options but not the feature film. Also the DVD that comes with the blu ray has it, why only the blu ray version don't?
B000PKX2KA|5.0|Works better than I ever expected! Loaded the drivers from CD plugged it in,opened Delorme X Maps. Take less than a minute to become active. Very good product.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love to hunt this is the perfect game for me and my sisters. I have the old one 2. It probably won't compare to this one.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I guess it streams Netflix and Youtube well enough. But kind of annoying having to use your phone every time. Just because it's possible, doesn't mean it's ideal. What else can it do? Can I stream my own media? Don't think so yet. Price is good though.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Really good game.  I really enjoy it. I am really glad that you can now play it on an android tablet.
0061438294|5.0|Love this book!!!! A good read and very easy to read and well explained!!! Good examples, love the way it is written too!!
B0013ND30W|2.0|Blu ray edition without spanish dub, this should be a stander because the dvd that comes with the blurry has it
1439175640|5.0|I love baking, I love cakes and muffins and pies and bars and cookies. I have also visited the Magnolia Bakery in NY and bought the book to complete the experience (of enjoying the banana pudding and red velvet cake!). Easy to follow, well and detailed in recipe presentation, works always.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Great action sequences! Kind of like transformers, but BIGGER! Guillermo del Toro has an incredible ability to tell stories and incorporate his vision through directing. He captures several facets of emotion and the amount of detail that goes into the effects is incredible. There was several times I felt I was at the edge of my seat in anticipation. I was also surprised by his ending (that is if you know his films you would understand what I mean) I am a big fan of his work. I hear there's talk of a sequel and I would like to see where he takes the story. The actors have good chemistry and it's great to see newer faces emerging onto the screen. I would say it's family friendly above age 10 maybe 12 (my son enjoyed it quite a bit). Definitely worth the time, I would buy it. Hope this review is helpful.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I'm a Mahjong addict, and this one is truly addicting. I have to play everyday, but I can't tell you how long. LOL.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|Buying it for my 8 year old nephew. He is in love with Michael. Still the KIng of Pop! This is what love is all about.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I loved hoe the separate stories came together.  Very well done.  Sure makes you think how to handle difficult situations
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great except sometimes this app lags on my kindle. The display is really good too. It is also very accurate.
B0063GORYU|5.0|A lot of fun and easy to use.  Anyone can do it .  Great learning tool for kids<br /><br />Anyone can do it for a time filler.
B008JFUN6E|5.0|Damon and foster with excellent acting with a beautiful story with great social commentary. Wouldn't have it any other way.
B004132HZS|5.0|I loved this series.  Who doesn't love this duo?  I cannot wait for the next season to come out.  All of the episodes are like a mini movie.  It's great!
0060254920|4.0|A classic! My 3 year old found it slightly frightening (her 2 year old brother loved it!). Beautiful pictures and not too long of a read.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|This is one of the best games on the Amazon app store now. I've been playing this game for hours on end and haven't gotten tired of it. I wouldn't care how much it's priced for $25.00 or 0.99 cents.
B00FN811SY|5.0|I use this app everyday. It's clear and simple. The Bible Questions Answered is perfect for the ministry. Can't wait for updates! Being able to access and read so many translations is incredible!
B00EVW0SA0|5.0|tremendous movie.  It's been a long time since we saw a good action movie like this one !  Highly recommended for all viewers !
B00EFFVZIM|5.0|I've been a fan of The Wanted for a couple years now, and seeing them in concert made me love them more. I liked them before any of my friends knew who they were. Their first album and the second one, \\"Battleground,\\" showcased their vocal talents and talent for coming out with catchy tunes.<br /><br />\\"Word of Mouth\\" begins with the anthem-esque hit \\"We Own the Night,\\" which has the guys celebrating the fun that comes with nightlife. \\"Walks Like Rihanna\\" is pretty catchy, too. However, one of my favorite tracks is \\"Glow in the Dark,\\" which brings out dubstep beats. Slower songs such as \\"Show Me Love (America)\\" and \\"Running Out of Reasons\\" are heartfelt. The only downside is that the U.K. version of the album is different, having two additional tracks. The U.S. track has \\"Glad You Came,\\" which was featured on TW's last EP release. I don't get why British fans have access to these songs unlike us Americans.<br /><br />\\"Word of Mouth\\" is a great, underrated release from The Wanted. Yes, they're considered a boyband, but they're quite different from other bands such as One Direction for example. I would say The Wanted's lyrical and musical style is more mature and more suited for nightclubs, yet their ballads also shine through. Check this album out for yourself. I'm sure it won't disappoint.
0753827662|4.0|Great book,  I give it four stars because I was a bit disappointed by the ending.  All the hype for this book didn't measure up.  If I had not known it was a best seller I probably would have enjoyed it even more.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is really awesome! You can buy and customize your gun. Also you can pick a level to play. I recommend this game to people who like hunting.
B004XVMCMQ|5.0|I have not read the book, so I cannot compare it to this movie. But being a period movie-lover, I found this story to be excellent in every way. The actors were nice to look at and all did well at portraying their characters. I can't imagine giving this anything but 5 stars.
1742204147|5.0|I could quibble here about giving this a five star rating, saying I wanted more photos, and better maps, but this books emphasis, is unlike those comments on my review of the India. I think the detail is easier to get here in-country, or from other sources.  I know a lot of things about Japan from my continued interest in the country since 1998, when I started getting into collecting and watching, anime and manga (Japanese comic books).  It's hard for the zist of the culture, to not seep into that kind of literature and video.  I actually took up an interest in those venues, because I'd seen so much American TV and movies, and growing up as a TV addict since the late fifties, that I've become somewhat jaded, for the lack of a better word. When it comes to knowing American TV and movie plotlines, I could decode the plot in the first few minutes of almost any show.  I noticed this some years ago, when I saw that new movie plots, that were lauded as great and original, by critics and fans alike, were so predictable to me.  Japanese media held a great deal of surprise for me and I became interested in the country as well.  A for instance was a sports anime I watched subtitles called \\"Touch\\", It was about twin brothers and the girl next door.  My Americanized plot radar was decoding this as a love triangle between the brothers and the girl with baseball as the backdrop.  I won't bore you with all the details of the rivalry, but after roughly 25 episodes about the end of the first season of an anime story, over 100 episodes long, one brother is killed in a traffic accident.  A main character, and one primary to what I thought was the main plot, dies and his brothers life changes forever.  Total surprise to me, and why I follow the genre today.<br /><br />This book little regional stories that are told as if they are true, but the astute reader will realize they are just tales about the region to enhance the experience.  For instance, one of the regions tells that it's a hotspot of sorts, for kappa, they explain the humanoid creatures live there, and like to feast on human souls, that they extract from the intestines.  A little gross, but non-the-less true when discussing kappa lore.  It goes on to say, if you go in the water where kappa may be found, to throw some cucumbers as they are a favorite food, and maybe the kappa will leave you alone. If all else fails, since kappa are very Japanese, bow to them and they will return the bow, and let out the water supply they retain in their heads which renders them helpless.  It goes on to say if you feel bad you might replace the water with a bottled water, and the kappa will return the favor in some special way.  Had I not known kappa from Japanese anime, what was in this book, would certainly have enlightened me in an entertaining way.<br /><br />This book is full of other information as well on how to handle visas, getting a rail pass, setting up lodging for a trip in advance, and even some updated sections on the post-Tsunami reconstruction, and the nuclear issues.  I must say if I'd been a much younger person, and could have afforded to, I would have gone there to participate in the reconstruction efforts, it would be a great way to get to know the country and the people.  Most of that is well underway now according to the book, but there are a few areas where people can pitch in an help.  It has the agencies you can contact if interested.<br /><br />As for the nuts and bolts of the book:<br /><br />1.  You have several pre-designed tours, plotted for regions of impressive sites and experiences.<br />2.  The usual good food guides, to either find dining or very interesting eats.<br />3.  A section to tell where to go to avoid the touristy spots if you are very adventurous, or speak some of the language.<br />4.  Tips and details you need to know if you've not visited Japan before or are going to a different region.<br />5.  Sites or experiences highlighted with a star to indicate a can't miss venture.<br />6.  A way to travel on a budget, if you are not rich and want to see more of Japan for less.<br />7.  Lots of small general area maps, that plot the major sites or attractions on them.<br />8.  A survival guide to tell you about post, police, government, medical and other important information.<br />9.  A pull out map of Tokyo (although not as detailed as you'd like).<br />10. Dozens of little history or cultural lessons on anything from fish to beer, to shrines, to the people.<br /><br />Overall, this book contains some of the best information I've ever seen in a Japan guide book.  Sure you can get better maps, and it doesn't include things like apartment info or how to find work, but that is not the intent of the book.  I for one loved hearing there is a Ghibli Museum, as an anime fan, a studio that is oven worshiped and copied by Disney, is some place I'd like to know more about.  Plus, I know a lot of very common cultural evens and such depicted in Japanese anime and manga, and I'd like to experience some of that myself.  Other interesting things to experience might be capsule hotels, and all the crazy vending machines that vend almost anything in Japan.  Either in electronic form, or the paper format this is a book I'll want to take with me on my first trip there, they make a Kindle edition I think, it would be nice to see that one and how well it matches with the paper book.  Recommended, I can't vouch for absolute accuracy, but the book does appear to strive for it as much as possible.  While I doubt everything is changed completely from the last pre-Tsunami edition, they've updated a lot so you won't be too misled.  If you follow the advice and book lodging well in advance you'll run into few troubles.  One thing I learned from this book, is that Japan is not a credit card culture, nor is it a place where hotels are just booked on the fly or walk-ins.  Plan accordingly.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I have only read a few books by John Grisham mostly because Fantasy or Horror are my favorite type of stories. A time to kill is one of my favorite books, I have read it multiple times and probably will end up reading it again. I was very excited when I found out about Sycamore Row. This book was an amazing story, and a great follow up to A Time to Kill even though it has nothing directly to do with that book. My Favorite character returns in Harry Rex and after reading this I have now went out and got a few more books by John Grisham. I recommend reading A Time To Kill before this book if you have not already. Both great stories and worth a read.
B00915G6MG|5.0|Love this series!  I have the first 10 seasons and so glad I purchased them. You will love them too!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|It is a fun game but it does occasionally have some technical issues that can be frustrating. The slots are cool.
B007N85POS|4.0|I wish that all of the extra ad's were just that instead of videos that I have to wait a few seconds before I can skip through them. Otherwise I love all of the Angry Birds with this one being second on my favorites only to the Season's version.
B00DAKW7Q2|5.0|Music is all very personal and I'm not sure why I'm being asked to review it.  What I may love, another person will not, but I'm tired of seeing it on my &#34;Review Purchases&#34; screen, so I really love this song.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|First I loved it, then it automatically updated and wouldn't work.  After I had paid for a book and been unable to read it for two weeks, I ended up having to buy a hard copy.  When it worked, it was great, when it didn't, it was frustrating.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|Veronica Roth decided to make the worst ending possible for this book. She obviously didnt take enough time to finish the book.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I've owned several similar type sharpeners, and this is, far and away, the best.  I have not, as yet, used the coarse stone, as I think it would probably make short work of a rusty ax head.  Using just the fine stone, I have put excellent edges on some pretty dull blades, and all it took were just a few strokes of the blade.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This was a well-written, wonderful book. I, being female, though that it might be too \\"male\\", but I really liked it. I could hardly put it down. I feel that true stories are usually the best.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the fact that my grandchildren can play without using my Facebook account. No need for unlocking levels!!! Easy download and free.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Excellent continuation of the series. Much better than the last - far fewer &#34;coincidences.&#34;  Wonderful writing!!  Great character development. I'm looking forward to reading the next in the series!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Interesting read about a fascinating man who is probably the father of our electronic age.  This book read like a novel and gave me a good understanding of how and why my IPhone is such a marvelous instrument.  It also gave me an insight into who Steve Jobs was.  He was a contradictory and driven man who gave us some of the greatest inventions of all time.  I bought my first IPhone less than a year ago and have never spent much time in an Apple Store, but now I plan to visit an Apple Store and examine the latest products.  He has made a fan out of a 60 something year old person.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I couldn't put it down. A great suggestion for anyone looking for a wonderfully written easy read. Two thumbs up!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I didn't realize when I ordered this that not only is it a case I could store it in and charge with a standard micro USB charger, but the case charges also and can charge my blue tooth headset again and again without plugging it in.  Fabulous!
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I got this game for my son but I'm now the one exclusively playing it. Thanks for creating such a fun game.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I like this clock, it looks GREAT on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9&quot;!!! (: Keep up the good work!!! (;
B00338QENI|5.0|I loved the combination of scientific data, personal family information and the emotional connection of the children Henrietta Lacks left behind after succumbing to cancer.  I knew nothing of HeLa cells before reading this book and am awed and a horrified how the harvesting of these cells took place.
B00CEF014E|5.0|Wow! What can I say? Solstice is the first psychological thriller that I have ever read so I wasn’t sure what to expect. It took me a little while to get into this book, but when Dana, the protagonist, leaves a mental hospital with her boyfriend the pace picked up pretty quickly. Author Damian Stevenson weaves a tale with twists and turns that lead the readers to believe that they know what is happening. Trust me, just when you are sure that poor Dana is as crazy as everyone thinks she is, the plot twists and you are not so sure. I found it hard to put the book down. It is a novella so I read it in one sitting. Even though some of the characters are pretty creepy, they are believable. If you like mystery/thrillers, I highly recommend this book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|To me this game has been a great success  since they came out with it. If you are wanting this app it is a great app and it will keep you very entertained.
0804137501|5.0|I'm a big fan of the SvN blog and Rework and Getting Real, so it's safe to say I was excited about Remote when I heard about it earlier this year. Coming from a global professional services firm, we've adopted a lot of workplace flexibility measures to fight back on the expenses associated with office space and our high-turnover/stress environment. I share the authors belief that going remote is the way of the future and this book highlights the reasons for going remote, the arguments against, and methods for optimizing the value of a remote culture.<br /><br />Since I work in IT, I understand the obvious connection between the authors and the software business. I think they did a fine job showing why remote working isn't just for IT and why there are benefits across industries. One of the few shortcomings of Rework was that I thought it was a little too IT-centric; some of the arguments presented there just wouldn't fit well in non-IT, traditional (read: old-fashioned) businesses. Remote does a good job explaining why some of these more traditional old-fashioned businesses can benefit from going remote. I especially liked the sections about hiring and retaining the best employees. Everyone can relate to this and it has helpful that they went into detail to explain exactly how they do it at 37 Signals (since at this point they are pretty good at it).<br /><br />It's a short, enjoyable read. It leaves the reader with a sense of what work could be like if you're courageous enough to think outside the norm and challenge conventions as to what work is supposed to be (and what it can be). I'd argue that almost any business owner or decision maker could benefit from this book, even if for just one little bit of information that makes you follow-up with one of their sourced documents. I know that finishing this book is just the beginning for me to rethink how remote work arrangements can be optimized.
B000068CNX|5.0|Got this as well as Season 1 for my daughter for Christmas. Got a great deal on these and she loves the series now she can watch it anytime!!
B005LAIIGM|5.0|I was not looking forward to this movie , The Trailers were horrendous but when i saw this movie in theaters , It was the complete meaning of a good sci fi flick due to its AMAZING visuals , AMAZING story and AMAZING characters that bring the best emotional feelings in a movie ever alive [ i mean that they bring the most powerful/ sad backstories that a person could think of ]. But Still this is not the best movie of the year , just 2 percent behind the best movie of the year. I give this film a 95.
1419705644|5.0|For fans of the series, this book is very interesting and fun. As a 22 year old, I enjoy the details and little references, but on the same note, this book may not be what the younger kids are looking for.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I would love this if it didn't lock up so much and it always prompts to turn on my location based service. Why does it need that? Take out the bugs and it's 5 star worthy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the game and happy that it is now available on Kindle! Worth the download you will enjoy the game

B008DM4OTA|4.0|My granddaughter (3 yrs old) loves this little app and always manages to discover new things. Only con, is that every now and then it locks and I have to take the battery off for my phone for it to work again.
B00BXZ3D6Y|1.0|I could not get it to play back or function as a recorder that would be anywhere near useful. It seemed to record and playback only short durations of recording. I could not get it to store what little it could record.  There were no instructions on how to navigate through its software. I wonder if it is device sensitive. It was not a useful app for me. Great that some folks are able to get it to work for them.
B008J8KBKY|3.0|Got this as a FAOTD, I though it would be something interesting. It's basically a connect 4 in a 3d environment. I didn't get to play the online multilayer (too much hassle to setup an account with them.) Luckily there was a guest local feature where I played against the computer. After a few rounds I got pretty bored and uninstalled.<br /><br />Overall impression:<br /><br />Graphics are nice<br />Sounds are nice<br />Offline against AI is a plus, challenging at higher difficulties<br />Probably many achievements? (I didn't play enough to find out)<br />Could be fun to play against friends<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />2.99 price tag seems too high for such a simple game<br />Boring after few rounds<br />Little replay value
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|This was a very, very clever haunting movie, scary in a mature manner without resorting to the jump out at you and gore of lesser films and a building of tension that was visceral. The actors, right down to the smallest roles were good, the house was wonderful and the effects were outstanding.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Got this as well as Seasons 2 and 3 for my daughter for Christmas. Got a great deal on these and she loves the series now she can watch it anytime!!
B006S01GH2|5.0|I'm a writer.  If I get stuck, this movie's whimsy based reality helps me unstick.  Similar to Stranger Than Fiction.
B00GGEV828|3.0|I bought the 2 disc extended edition Hobbit DVD and the cover says that disc 1 contains \\"The Company of Thorin\\" but it does not. The cover also states that disc 2 contains \\"Durin's Folk: Creating the Dwarves\\" but it does not. As far as the movie goes I don't like the fact that Jackson put in at least 3 unnecessary and uncalled for scenes to wit, the 2 rather gross and untolkien like troll scenes in which 1 troll puts a rather gross thing (I won't mention what it is) in the food they were making and the scene where Bilbo is grossed out when standing practically under another trolls rear end. (also Jackson left out the talking purse which was not right at all). The 3rd scene I find reprehensible is the naked dwarves frolicking in the Elves fountain which is gross and untolkien like as well.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Finally candy crush on kindle! I'm far behind but I'm catching up quickly..I love this game it helps pass time and it makes you focus..I would recommend anyone who likes a challenge to try it.

B008JFUQZ2|3.0|Not a bad Saturday afternoon film, very murky and dark visuals, predictable story line. The leads at least were pleasant but my oh my did they drag some extraneous bits into characters.

1441761268|5.0|Five stars! It would be hard to add to the well-deserved, glowing reviews for this book. I listened to the audio book version and the narrators made these strong women who stick together through impossibly difficult situations, come alive. If you haven't yet read this book, I highly recommend the audio version.
B008J8KBKY|5.0|This is a fun 3d take on tic tac toe. Surprisingly well designed considering the 3d. I haven't tried the multiplayer yet, but looks like fun as well.I'm happy that they don't MAKE you sign up for an account to use the app. If they did, this would get deleted right away. Good job devs!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Let my start by saying that I was initially nervous about buying this due to the low price - but I decided to take the good deal presented to me and I am GLAD I DID!<br /><br />Key points:<br /><br />-The mouse feels great in my hand, very ergonomic. My hand seems like it naturally wants to conform to it's shape.<br /><br />-It's very customizable. All buttons on the mouse can be changed to do what you want them to (with profiles to save them to). The mouse/scroll wheel sensitivity, acceleration, polling rate, LED colors etc are also all customizable as well. Pretty much everything about it. This is all done through their downloadable software. There are insert-able weights that come in their own tin as well.<br /><br />-Sensitivity can be changed on the fly with a button which is great in-game.<br /><br />-Programmable macros, which I do not use, but nice if I may ever have the need in the future.<br /><br />I do not have any complaints. It's got a lot of nice features and has a solid construction. All for a low price. If you want a nice gaming mouse, get it!
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|I don't understand how this book is so highly rated.  It is not scary in the least.  The only scary part, in my opinion, was in the beginning when Dan was still a boy. Otherwise, the book is extremely tame.  I've had nightmares from some of Stephen King's books (The Shining and The Stand) and been incredibly scared by others (Skeleton Crew). This was nothing like any of those books.  I gave it 3 stars because it hooked me, as it had the potential to be scary and interesting, but it totally let me down.  Definitely not a worthy follow-up to The Shining.
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|Loved it, it was clever, the stars all fitted their parts and it was visually stunning to say the least.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Great Movie!  Great story line and keeps everyone interested.  Nothing over the top as far as off the wall, just a good movie.
034580404X|5.0|Read them all and was fun but think it went a bit to far with the story and would not read it again
B008VBYN80|4.0|so far I like this game. only played for one day. it looks like it will be a pay for extra diamonds kind of game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I think it's a good game for long car rides. My mom got me to level 91 on my kindle  and she said its so big and smooth!!!
B008D28HYS|5.0|This is my absolute favorite game on my tablet.  Each expert puzzle keeps me busy for 2-3 hours, so the game lasts a long time.  I wish they would come out with new puzzles because I'm almost done!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Star Trek, second round, this is such an improved rendering of a well loved series as against the first set. Very 21st Century<br />Character flaws and human qualities ver much to the fore. Effects great and welcome Benedict Cumberbatch, hope to see more of him.
B00E8KLWB4|1.0|I wish this game came with a set of instructions. I can not figure out what each of the icons mean. I like playing the game but I am sure there is so much I am missing out on. Barb
B001FEO6PK|5.0|Viewed a documentary on Pivot TV and was amazed by this young man, that is how we will always think of him.  His music is fantastic.
B003L77GGU|5.0|This is the best show on television. It is full of action, drama and humor. If you were a fan of Angel and Buffy you will enjoy this show.
B00E9A656K|5.0|This game is ideal for anybody that likes racing. You can set the difficulty and it is fun to beat the crew because they talk trash about you.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is a game that everyone can enjoy. It's relaxing and fun to play. Avoiding jelly fish, mines, while navigating the ocean to find &#34;treasures&#34;.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|This is an exceptional series following a rag tag group of people through a bleak, dangerous world. Few new characters introduced. Some have outlived their usefulness and departed, permanently. Really don't know how they will conclude in the eventual rounding up of this saga. Hope it isn't for a while yet.
B00EW9GQR6|3.0|It took a few times listening through the album, but I think it's a good album. It is certainly better than Born This Way which I think was pretty weak and impossible to listen through more than a handful of times. The music in Born This Way felt dark, oppressive, bombastic, over-indulgent and incoherent. This album still over does things in places, but it feels much more coherent and takes a step back towards the greatness of The Fame and The Fame Monster. The better songs on this album include: Aura, Venus, G.U.Y., Sexxx Dreams, Manicure, Do What You Want, Gypsy, and Donatella. Artpop and Dope are the only two songs I find unbearable. The other songs are typical album fillers that are decent, but I wouldn't recommend them to anyone straight away. One criticism regarding the album as a whole is that the songs are fun, but the lyrics are lacking. I'll agree this is true, but not to an extent that it turns me off. I suppose with the title and theme being \\"Artpop\\" some may have expected more depth and might be disappointed with what they find. That's fair enough, but compared to other pop artists, I'd say she's about on par or slightly ahead in the lyrics department.<br /><br />I've always enjoyed Gaga, so I am probably slightly biased in her favor and a non-fan might not find as much to enjoy here. Overall though, a good album. Does it live up to the hype? No, not really, but when one over-hypes things the way Gaga has a tendency to do then falling short will always be a problem. In short: Gaga fans will probably enjoy the album, non-fans will probably find some things to like but nothing groundbreaking. 3 out of 5 stars is a little harsh and it really deserves around 3.5.
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|I was so excited to see Fruit  Drop Part 11 was available for purchase.I did not know what to do since I had finished Part 1.I really love this game. I hope they have started planning for part 3.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If you like Stephen King, this is a must read.  As always a well told story of a familiar character.  This sequel to the Shining does not disappoint--a page turner from start to finish
B0085KGHI6|5.0|Must have documentation of Chicago blues and Rolling Stones at important time in history.  Stones are lucky to be on stage with Muddy Waters.  As more Chicago blues greats get on the stage, Ron and Keith become increasingly less important.  Mick looks like a fool in his tennis outfit.  All of it is good fun and I think the Stones are somewhat humble and appreciative to be playing with their idols.
B00E9ZATJO|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this prequel to Monsters Inc although the humour ( due in part to it's novelty premise) wasn't as satisfying.<br />Changes in their personal characteristics was interesting.
0385537131|5.0|It's just as well-written as any Grisham book, but the plot here is a gem. I put it at the top of my JG list and it's also one of the best books I've read this year. Additionally, if you like Grisham's style of humor and sarcasm in his characters and dialogue, you will love Sycamore Row.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Its okay if you like that sort of game. I dont play it very often. I like the more fast paced games.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game has amazing physics for the bullets, the animals, and the guns. Graphics are perfect for a Kindle. There are lots of upgrades for your guns to spend all of your &amp;#34;Hunter bucks&amp;#34;. There are even special challenges that include killing zombie animals. I highly recommend it to everyone.
B00EW9GQR6|3.0|I'm one of the biggest fans of Gaga out there, and after waiting for an album that was constantly hyped for two years by Gaga and her team as nothing short of the rebirth of pop music, I can't even begin to explain how disappointed I am in this album. I'm used to Gaga constantly reinventing herself and her music, and that's usually what makes me such a big fan, because she always manages to pull it off. I was amazed at how effortlessly she transitioned between the light-heartedness of The Fame to the dark and edgy Fame Monster to the completely rock n' roll Born this Way. But ARTPOP is the first of her albums where the transition to a new style did not pay off.<br /><br />What exactly is the style and genre of music in ARTPOP that's so disappointing, then? Well, if you figure it out, let me know. Because after about a dozen listens, I still see the album as just a mix tape of different genres that have all been pummeled into submission to fit into the scope of pop songs, doing service to neither the genre in question nor pop music. The way that Gaga blended rock and pop in Born this Way was seamless and nothing short of brilliance. In ARTPOP, however, the hands of the craftswoman show, and the songs in result sound contrived and try-hard. It seems that rather than just trying to make decent pop music as she has all her career (and succeeding, for the most part), she decided instead to imprint this artificial idea of \\"ART\\" (in all caps, of course, to make it even more pretentious) onto songs that otherwise might have succeeded.<br /><br />In some cases, the experimentation does pay off, such as in the blistering middle-eastern inspired opener track, \\"Aura\\", although if you can find the demo version on the internet, I recommend downloading that one instead, because Gaga managed to ruin even one of the more successful songs on this album by changing the first verse into an alien-esque drawl that is just plain painful to listen to. \\"Do What U Want\\" featuring R. Kelly was also one of the big surprises of the album. The collaboration, strange at first, turned out to be pop brilliance. The song sounds like Gaga's take on a Michael Jackson song, updated for today's audiences, and the risk she took paid off big time.<br /><br />The worst offenders on this album are the ones that try too hard. And it's a shame, because listening to them, you can see an unpolished gem at the center of them. And if you could follow me in this metaphor for a moment, it's painfully obvious that these gems were never meant to be displayed as they are on the album. They needed a hard cut down the middle, to become something entirely different, because they were never going to work in the first place without a major revision. But instead, it feels like Gaga just kept on polishing and polishing them into something they were never meant to be in the first place.<br /><br />Prime examples are \\"Manicure\\", which has a delicious grinding 50s beat, but a chorus that goes nowhere and lyrics that run aimlessly around a forced pun, and \\"Venus\\", which tries so hard to be experimental and pop at the same time, yet ends up sounding like I accidentally hit the \\"next\\" button on my ipod several times during the song by accident, landing on several 80s synth songs that should've stayed back in the 80s. \\"Jewels N Drugs\\" is quite simply an abomination. Gaga tries so hard to be hood, but it's just glaringly obvious that this is a privileged girl who grew up on the upper west side and isn't in touch with hip hop as a genre whatsoever.<br /><br />In the end, the songs sound as pretentious and try-hard as the title. The album gives one the feeling that Gaga is trying so hard to prove to the world that she's a true \\"artiste\\", and not just another pop star, but the joke ends up being on her, because the world already knows she is, even if she doesn't. The ending track \\"Applause\\" truly is perfect for this album, because it encapsulates what the album is silently screaming in every second -- that this is a work craving validation from the world rather than validating itself and waiting for the world to follow, as Gaga's previous albums did. The hype has become more important than the work, and in the end, the album is as colossal yet lifeless as the sculpture on the cover.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|After helping two parents with ALZ I was told to read this book.  I wish I had read it before. Excellent read and new insights on what is going on behind the eyes of the poor soul with Alz.  The book also points out that ALZ does not just impact the patient but everyone connected to the patient.  Those near the one with ALZ who run from the problem are perhaps the true lost souls. The author clearly pointed that out to me.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|Excellent in all ways. It was scary, tense and worrying. Brad Pitt as always was very good, that man gets better as he gets older.<br />I liked the fact that his wife and family looked like a family not a magazine advert as well.
B000SSPL2Q|5.0|This box set is the sine qua non of Sibelius box sets.  Neeme Jarvi and the Gothenburg Symphony capture the coolness and ethereality of Sibelius perfectly.  There is no Romantic excess or false lushness here, as you can perceive in the von Karajan recordings.  Jarvi coaxes a crisp precision from the Gothenburg musicians, producing a sound reminiscent of the Cleveland Orchestra under George Szell in the 1960s.  The recordings by Colin Davis and Osmo Vanska are marvellous, no doubt, but Jarvi outshines even these masters of Sibelius.  This set has the added benefit of containing all the tone poems, even rarer ones such as \\"Night Ride and Sunrise\\" and \\"Andante Festivo.\\"  This is an essential collection.  Highly recommended.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Would have given a higher rating if read in true form paper back was not meant for electronic reading. Was truly an amazing book to read.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|nice app nice game so cool mostly for kids I let my two play with it. or if you are a traveler
B004N66XYE|5.0|I cannot say how much I adored this series.  Much better than the original.  And it is rare that a re-make can be better than an original. I was surprised but so so grateful that I have found this version. The performances are exquisitely calibrated, the women and especially the men are beautiful and both are gorgeously dressed. The interiors are stunningly done.  Capital art direction and set design.<br /><br /> I really felt drawn to and engaged with all the characters and found myself haunted by this series after seeing it - causing me to purchase it post-haste. I can simply watch it over and over.  There is a delicious sexual tension built up between the various pairings of lovers.... really enjoyed that. The only reason I call it \\"almost perfect\\" is because I would have liked to have seen more kissing and seduction  scenes. The ones that are there are great but more would have been even better.<br /><br />  The picture also manages effectively to convey a feeling of anxiety and impending doom with regards to the threat of war.. it all serves to heighten immediacy and feeling .<br />It is also extraordinarily beautiful visually and so lushly romantic.... encomiums and encomiums of praise!!!<br />I was so disappointed that there are only two seasons. Why!!??  I wish this version could be as long as the original.  Really hunger for more of it.
0062060554|2.0|This is my first drama/thriller book and my expectations had been high and they were not met at all. It took me around two months to finish this book as part of a book club reading. The title fits the story 'cause it's what I would read before I go to sleep and off I'd go.<br /><br />SOME SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />Some of the problems are:<br />1) I found that there was no real thrill or suspense in the book. You're facing three characters in the book, out of which the doctor is too young to have been the one that injured the main character. There is no room for guessing what happened to her, no hidden messages to capture since most of the book they are in their house, no drama between certain characters since there is no one for drama to develop between. Finally after half way, somewhere around 3/4 of the book they introduce her friend that added nothing to the story, no subtle hints, no real drama, just a character used in forwarding the plot.<br />2) Locations & characters - Whoa, talk about a lack of. I felt there were more locations and characters in Cast Away than in this book. Usually you have to read a good portion of the book to have a mental layout of a place such as a city and vividly picture its inhabitants, the ambiance, and have your five senses come alive. In this book it's just the house and starting the book you've got enough details to blueprint it to a carpenter and that environment got old fast. Why? 'Cause she nags on and on. Which brings us to point 3!<br />3) She's her worst enemy - She plays both the hostage and the captor during 9/10 of the book. Her husband is loving and caring throughout, also more understanding than most, yet she writes how she cannot trust him and how she has her doubts about everything. Sure, he shows signs of frustration every now and then, but that was it. She'd test him and when there were inconsistencies her doctor would explain how it's his way of coping with everything, but she's jot it down as if he was lying. It was frustrating to say the least.<br /><br />The plot twist at the end I did not expect it throughout the book, I mean, no real hints were given since she can't exactly be trusted, and there's no reason to suspect the husband is lying about anything. I did see the plot twist coming shortly before it happened, but by then I was just a few pages away from it.<br /><br />Perhaps if I came in with no real expectation I could give the book three stars, but that was not the case. This book should also not be compared to Memento for they are vastly different. They are told differently, the whole plot is different, and their conditions are slightly different, too. This protagonists story could also not have been told with his condition.was frustrating to say the least.<br /><br />The plot twist at the end I did not expect it throughout the book, I mean, no real hints were given since she can't exactly be trusted, and there's no reason to suspect the husband is lying about anything.

B002AWX6UM|4.0|Usually when people hear about bloody wars that are using children as soldiers, the first emotion to come up is hate; this story gives us a new perspective on the whole situation. Taking place in the first 16 or so years of his life, Ishmael leads us from his home village, through the war, then to relief, though only temporary. Ishmael’s internal struggles and circumstances are brought back to life through his writing. Though the war was so very gruesome, we can find hope that young men like Ishmael have the capacity to live on. The story is captivating to say the least and has a good collage of humor, good times, bad times, hopeful times, and hopeless times. Overall, the story is unforgettable, even though most people are unaware that so much violence exists in so many places around the world. I would recommend everyone to read the book to be aware of the situation.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|This is just a quick review of the commentary. It was given by a former CIA member as he gives his thoughts on his career in the biz as well as helping out on the movie. Some of the scenes are spot on he said as far as authenticity, some make believe. He never bashes the film though. What I liked was that he was pretty forward about CIA techniques, how to pick locks, trail someone, kill someone with a pencil, and how to travel light when on missions. Plus much more insight into the silent career of an agent. If you like commentaries, give it a listen.

B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Since one of my absolute favorite albums with Eminem is Relapse, I never thought he could top it. I liked Recovery but Relapse was fantastic. So when I heard that Em was coming out with a new album I was a bit hesitant but non the less happy that he was releasing new material. Well, I listened to the MM2 album a couple of times to get a feel for it and I totally fell in love with it. It's been playing on my iPod continuously. Forget other rappers, Eminem is a genius when it comes to words plus he doesn't take himself so seriously and he's very funny. My 2 favorite songs are Survival and Berzerk. Headlights is also very good. No song is actually worth skipping on this album which is great. Sometimes I have to stop listening to the album while I'm on the bus because he just cracks me up and I start laughing. This is definitely 5/5!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|one of the greatest devices ever made uses it all the time with Chrome web browser , iPhone 5 ,or tablet streaming YouTube streaming Netflix is just a perfect device it's a must haves for a person who into streaming videos
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Short and to the point, this book represents what all fitness books should be about. In under 200 pages Michael Matthews explains the hows and whys of getting in shape without all the fluff that most fitness magazines offer. I read it in two days and I can honestly say i learned more in that time than I have in 5 years of being a muscle and fitness subscriber. I immediately put the workouts and nutritional advice to use and i feel incredible. Now not all of the information is mind blowingly new but the fact that all of the information comes backed by actually science is pretty cool. We've all read articles in magazines and thought \\"this is bullcrap\\" so its nice see factual evidence. Great read for anyone sick of playing the guessing game of fitness.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Pretty easy to use and it is nice to watch youtube videos, though I wish there was a browser on android connectivity and the online stuff to connect a chrome browser on an older Windows OS (Xp) was messed up, but I got the URL off of a newer Windows host (a Windows 7 desktop) and used that on the older laptop and it worked there.<br /><br />I think this is the kind of product where there is greater support coming, but what it is now is fine, I just can't wait for it to be outstanding.

B00BAXFECK|2.0|This book was highly hailed and really overrated.  Yes, it is a rather interesting story, but, overall, pretty much like watching paint dry.  The characters are very cookie-cutter and the prose arid when not overblown.  My expectations were way too high.

B0000009S3|3.0|This is Zappa's attempt to fuse jazz and a hint of classical sound. It's not a bad effort.  I owned this recording on an LP back in the 70s, when l could say that &#34;one side&#34; is really good.  On cd, I have to say that half the cuts are really nice, esp &#34;Peaches en regalia&#34;, &#34;The Son of Mr Green-jeans&#34; and &#34;Little Umbrellas&#34; (where DID he get those names?).  The rest are no-where near as listenable.

B00EAH3D6C|5.0|Normally, I hate it when female opera singers sing mainstream music...they either sound like they're slumming, or trying to swat a fly with a Cadillac. Mme. Dessay, however, achieves spot-on perfection as she sings in a sexy, clear, delightful new voice. This isn't Lucia, the pyrotechnics are much more subtle, but listen... it takes incredible skill and talent to sing this difficult, emotional, lovely music so effortlessly and beautifully. Brava, Natalie!
B00005ATQD|5.0|Great movie, very well done with an all star cast. Bizzare? Life is in general. That is what makes it so interesting.
B001W79MBI|5.0|I saw clips of this anime on Youtube when I searched for the best anime fighting sequences. I liked them so much, I decided to buy the movie. The movie did not disappoint. They're probably the best animated fight scenes I've seen to date--beautifully choreographed, complex, realistic and detailed. I'd rate them higher than Samurai Champloo and Cowboy Bebop. (Unrealistic anime fight scenes can leave the room right now.)<br /><br />As far as colors and image quality, well, for one it's just DVD, not Blu-ray. The movie mainly sticks with browns and muted colors. Nothing's saturated. Even the clear blue skies look more content than bright and optimistic. It reminds me of the winter months, and I believe it settles the movie's tone very well.
B00BAXFECK|2.0|I feel very much like the young child in that  story by Hans Christian Anderson titled &#34;The Emperor's New Clothes&#34; when he points out to the adoring crowd that the Emperor is naked.  In order to read 800 pages and enjoy it one would seem to care about the characters and about what happens to them.  I felt like I was slogging through through the marsh to reach the end of this tome and felt only a sense of relief when I reached the last page.  To compare this book to &#34;To Kill a Mockingbird&#34; is particularly insulting to that classic.  This book is a absurd story populated with mostly thoroughly unlikeable characters including the story's principal character.  At first one feels sympathy for Theodore but by the time the he departs Las Vegas to return to NYC he has lost whatever moral compass his mother instilled in him and wanders untethered through the rest of the book.<br />The reviews for this book are as pompous and pretentious as I have ever read.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|If you are at all curious about Boardwalk Empire, pick this up and start watching. This show is as entertaining as Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, etc.<br /><br />The story line is great and has relevant historical landmarks you may remember learning about in school.<br /><br />The story starts out slow and will take a few episodes to grow on you, but all the best shows need to set up the story and introduce you to the character of the characters.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good show that is well established, look no further than Boardwalk Empire.

B005H9B2CE|4.0|I usually don't really like superhero movies as they are often rife with bad acting, unworthy scripts, and 2 dimensional characters; Special effects are often used as a way to hide the fact that there is not much of a story.  Having said that- Thor fairs fairly well as far as this genre goes.  Primarily due to the character Loki and the brilliant actor who portrays him.<br /><br />Whether you are someone who lived under the shadow of a sibling or someone who felt lied to & betrayed by family.. whether you're someone who felt they weren't ever given a fair chance growing up or someone who was raised by a cold and restrictive parent.. or whether you were just someone who has felt like an outsider for much of their lives, chances are you're going to feel some sort of affinity toward Loki.  And lets face it.  This is going to mean a huge part of the population.  Is there any wonder people gravitate toward this character unlike any other?  Out of all the superhumans in the marvel universe thus far, Loki is by far the most human.<br /><br />Thor is an oaf who's idea of fun is literally pounding his way through things.  At the beginning especially, he is completely ruled by his ego and emotions. This changes somewhat through the course of the movie.  Though not necessarily stupid, Thor is not really intelligent either.  His idea of war includes no forethought and no strategy.  What Thor does have aside from his massive structure is a lot of heart and conviction so he's overall a decent human being with a strong sense of self.  Conversely Loki is a guy who thinks before he acts.  Though he has a mischevious side, he is very intelligent (and at least at first) is able to put aside his ego and emotions for the greater good-  that is until he finds out his entire life is a lie and he basically snaps.  At the risk of sounding like someone who is excusing Loki's very serious misdeeds- one might even go as far as to say that Loki's \\"turn\\" is merely an exercise in reaching out foranother identity after he so abruptly lost his.<br /><br />The movie is not perfect by far.  In fact, if it weren't for Loki it would've been a bit of a throw-a-way like most other movies of this genre.  Chris Hemsworth makes a great Thor, but the script fails him sometimes.  The romance between Thor and Jane is difficult to swallow.  The idea that a brilliant physicist falls head over heels for a witless oaf like Thor (as he can be described in the beginning of the movie)  just because he fills out his shirt well is a hard sell and unfortunately, this film doesn't even bother to try to sell it.  Thor's interest in Jane is also a bit of a mystery as they have nothing in common. We're simply asked to accept this romance without ever being given any reason to care whether or not they come together - or stay together for that matter.  Some scenes were choppy.  Though not a perfect movie, it is by far the best superhero movie I've personally seen to date.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Of all the free games out there candy crush saga is the best.  Some of the levels are very challenging but extremely enjoyable. I am an addict.  I am not on facebook so that means I cannot get extra lives, so I have to wait 24 hours for another  5 lives. Thank you Candy Crush.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Didn't play candy crush for the longest time. I didn't see what was so interesting.  Then just the other day I figured ah what the heck.  Been playing it every since. Good thing they limit you with life, or I'd get nothing done!
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|This show is fantastic. By now you should be invested and this season will not disappoint at all. It is well worth the price to continue on with the story and if you are into the extras, they are well worth the watch.
B001I45UFC|5.0|This is a AMAZING book. All of them are really good. The movie for this book is also really good. I love all of his books are really good.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I was concerned after reading some of the reviews I wasn't going to like it but I was happily satisfied with the series overall including the third book.  I did not however care for the split narration I was able to predict a part of the ending by the author doing so and I at times was getting confused by which character was speaking.  I would have also liked a supporting book on some of the happenings during the purity war and what was occurring more in the fringe.  The author touched on it a little but it could have made the struggle for the main characters more personal to relate to those they were fighting for outside the city as well as within.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I can see how a lot of radio listeners aren't really going to \\"get\\" this album, as it is pretty out there compared to her earlier work, but fans of her who have been listening since 2008 will appreciate her new vision.<br /><br />I'm not going to waste my time writing about every song because you either hate ARTPOP or love it, my opinion is useless to you. But I must say that Mary Jane Holland is CRAZY good and I'm putting it in my top five favorite Gaga tracks next to Judas, Paparazzi, Born This Way, and Edge of Glory.<br /><br />Buy the physical copy of ARTPOP as there are limited edition foil sleeves right now and you can have some beautiful photos of Gaga and Jeff Koons.<br /><br />10/10, as usual.
B000Q7B8FS|4.0|The Bourne movies are all wonderful to watch and enjoy.  I would recommend everyone who likes action to watch them.
B003TGMFG4|5.0|I bought this book after watching Into the Wild. This book has so much more information about the journey and the relationships than the movie does. I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure or romance, because you could argue that Chris loved nature to the point this could be the story about a mans love of nature.<br /><br />Either way, amazing read for any age. You will become entrapped and want to read more and more. Afterwards, be sure to check out the 2007 movie of the same title. You won't be disappointed.

B000FCKGPC|3.0|the first few books I found myself unable to put them down and now it seems to be dragging on and monotonous.  I will finish the series because I want to know how it ends but I have read a whole other series since starting this book which is an indication I am bored with it.
B00GHJ1S2M|1.0|As a preface--I own all of Gaga's cds so far.  I think her best ones were her first two releases...then she started to decline....I even have heard that horrid \\"christmas tree\\" song...<br /><br />Aura--ugh..  I dont think I like this song..it starts off really slow...with that horrible effected voice.  Anyways.. Then the part where she starts saying she wears a burqa for fun... really?  really?  That is just lame and insulting to both a large portion of the world's culture and religion.  I really do not like the odd little sounds in the background.  The chorus \\"do you want to see me naked?\\"  no.... I'll pass thank you.  I'mMusically though this song is all over the place..and I didn't like it. 4/10<br /><br />Venus- strong start.  Slightly catchy.  When she says Venus it sounds like something else..  The \\"take me to your planet\\" is pretty catchy... the lyrics are shallow compared to her earlier releases.  I feel the repetition just speaks of how she can't think of more lyrics... The song *might* grow on me in time....(maybe). However the vast majority of it is copied from another artist.  5/10<br /><br />GUY =\\"god of sexual desire?\\" what the ?????? -- this is just so lame lyrically...  This sounds like a manipulation via sex song... I really think it is tactless, not feminist in the slightest bit (actually its just the opposite) and incredibly lame.  Actually it is kind of gross.  Her voice is alright on this song, but just alright.  Listen Gaga, you always have the power to leave someone.  Seriously?  I hope she wrote this when she was on \\"dope.\\" \\"Mars One\\" (OMG THIS LINE???!!!! WHAT?!)))  1/10<br /><br />Sexx Dreams- Her desperate and horny song..This is so lame..and the sound is just..kind of killing my ears.  GAGA what the heck are you doing? .  I don't care if you touch yourself to your boyfriend at night...really?  who cares?  I don't care about your sex dreams...I hate the sound of this song..its like electronic ear rape...there is a background noise that sounds like a frog burping in an 80's michael jackson video bass slap.  cannot get into it..Then the stop \\"i can't believe i'm telling you this i've had a couple of drinks\\"  ummm gurll please!  -1/10<br /><br />Jewel's and Drugs-- \\"don't want your jewels want your drugs?\\"  This is sooo bad...and annoying.. I mean seriously?  It sounds horrible.  \\"my habits expensive,\\"  Yep..This is so bad.  What is \\"stupid attractive?\\" please explain that to me.  The sounds are just bad.  She is not a rapper.  At this point Miley Cyrus is less annoying (HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE!!!!??---DEAR GOD NO).. oh no video game noises what is that?  This is so bad.  \\"good XXXXX  in the passengers seat \\"  gross/derogatory towards women.  I just hate all the different sounds of this cd...why?  STICK WITH ONE DAMN SOUND THIS IS NOT AN ELECTRIC KIOSK.  ok more rapping.. this is so bad. ugh... this isn't even good rap.  ok now she is back \\"jewels and drugs---baby hussle.\\"  oh please.  Gaga you are white, and stupid!  Is that \\"stupid attractive?\\" (gags). -2/10<br /><br />praise god its over!  (few seconds of silence- 10/10)<br /><br />ManiCure- strong start....not annoying..sounds like it was off of Born This Way (the better parts).  This sounds like it could be on the radio, still not anywhere close to Bad Romance.  Middle part sounds like it was off of a Madonna record in 1986.  (what else is new).  5/10<br /><br />Do What You Want- ok yeah we know you feel good...(yawns).  So you trip then pick up... \\"do you what you want with my body.\\"  How sad.  With R Kelly? LOL.  Did you make a video of this?? That would be far more popular than this horrid album... did he just said \\"i could be the cream in your butt?\\"  lol..Ok probably not but listen to it fast while you are multitasking...it sounds really hilarious.  oh yeah singing curse words  all pretty---doesn't change that this song is about being used and saying it is fine.. (gross).  pass...what a shame because it is the least annoying musically (so far).4/10<br /><br />ARTPOP- sounds like a telephone... so far not annoying (3 seconds in).. Ok she is back to talking only about sex.. (yawn--so boring really ??? !).  Why is she talking so much on this cd?? did something happen to her throat?  Ok this song is slightly catchy (so far).... Maybe this is the best track???  (hope not)..but so far it isn't bad.  what is with this talking??? IT SO RUINS THE SONG!!! NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Swine-  the intro.. what is that sound?  it sounds like weird hiccups... Autotune all over the place.. Her voice is so bad.  \\"squeal out your so disgusting - your just a pig inside a human body\\" (hmm like yourself?)....This is song is very annoying...and has dumb lyrics..  Why would you even give a swine a song?  Is it THAT noteworthy?  oh man i don't like this techno frog smashing keyboard synth sound... at least dub step artists aren't agitating.  This is so bad, it sounds like she is gasping for air.... just shut up! 1/10<br /><br />Donatella- \\"i' am so fab, check out i'm blonde, i'm skinny i'm rich.\\"  (yawn)..Really Gaga? You realize that your fan base is probably none of these things.. this is ok so far.... once it starts... (so far) i'm only less than a minute in..  Shameless promotions of products abound!  It reminds me of \\"mickey\\" you know that 80's song?  And who is Gaga kidding--SHE IS DONATELLA!  She is the 1% She's a rich chick  with expensive fashion!  Is she pretending she is not??? I mean really?  \\"ask your gay friends for advice,\\" (about fashion?) can she be more stereotypical?  Or was that a nod to using a subculture in her last cd.. musically one of the less annoying tracks. 5/10<br /><br />Fashion! - yay a piano starts it.  is this going to be a ballad?  Oh wait..no.  \\"sweat sweat?\\"  What is that weird sound in the background that is high pitched...weird.  I know you love to think you are hot..but really?  This song reminds me of Vogue.  \\"I own the world, we own the world, look at me now, i feel ontop of the world.\\"  Oh God.  I don't care.  Maybe because I think fashion is idiotic...But as a song it isn't that strong.  It is the best so far I've found (thusfar) on this album.  It listenable.  She's trying to do her broadway \\"voice\\" that she puts on with her NY accent.  What is with this middle section in really bad French--it is very obvious that guy does not speak French...Fashion Fe Fa Fassshiiiiinnnn.  Blatant copy of David Bowie.  6/10<br /><br />Mary Jane Holland (oh is it about her smoking habits!?) - oh no it sounds exactly like Bloody Mary (she copies her self?).. I swear it is the same.  No.  Yes you made a deal with the devil, i would believe that.  This sounds like leftover trash.  This is not listenable.  What is with the shoutout part?  It is so distracting and not-musical.  Ugh....She had to be high when she was doing this who album.  \\"I'm rich as piss.\\"  The grassy part of my insides???? And my what starts to sprout?  LOLOL... This is so laughable.  1/10<br /><br />Dope- is this a quiet pleasant song?  Piano!  I hear a piano!  OH MY GOD I almost forget she knew how to play!  Is that singing?  Because I dont think that is singing...unless she was high when she recorded this song, in which case that makes sense.  Yes Gaga you \\"bleeped up again,\\" on this whole album.  And no your fans will not forgive you, since they are your god.  \\"my awhhrrt would break withoutt u, my wowouww would break without you,\\" (yawn)..yeah you need something... It isn't drugs.  \\"I need you more than doooooooo pe.\\"  you need rehab..... Seriously bad..  1/10<br /><br />Gypsy- oh ok!  a decent song!  They exist on this cd!  Well just one.  A listenable one..what a shock...it still has that bouncy-ass dance sound.. but not nearly as bad.  And she sings.  But this does not redeem the 51 minutes of pain I just endured.  Ok take that back, the middle part is annoying...  \\"gypsy gypsy gypsy i.\\"  ugh..ok it stopped... 7/10<br /><br />Applause- The only good song on this CD.  Although it reeks with vanity lyrically at least you can listen to it.  It is catchy and interesting.  8/10<br /><br />In conclusion:<br /><br />Gaga has gone falling off the Musical poo-cliff and into a pile of her own \\"art\\" pop feces.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is so sad and beautiful. It is hard to imagine how a movie will at all capture the gorgeousnesss of the authors multi colored  breathing words. You could watch the movie of the book thief but you have to read the book to actually see it.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I love this show and this season did not disappoint. I purchased this after watching the first season with no expectation and this quickly turned into my favorite show on tv. I highly recommend this show to my friends all the time. Well worth getting into. Well established show and isn't going to get cancelled any time soon.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|So much potential in the story line, but it falls short.  Abrupt twists in the plot line really makes it hard to get into the flow of the story.  I got the book for free and for that I am glad.  I have recently been trying out self published books and I have not been impressed.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Great game. Easy to use. Lots of variety in forms and set ups. Hard to beat. Especially at the price.
B009HUB40Y|3.0|Interesting take on match 3.  Only get a minute a round, so you have to be fast. It's enough of a challenge to keep me going.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|my great grand daughters really like this game. I don't. any game you have to buy to go further is not my game.
B009LDD54K|5.0|For fans of this show, you must get this season. I'm not big into giving spoilers, but I am very pleased with the season.<br /><br />The quality of the box is great and the extras are awesome, if you are into them.
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|it would not work unless I took almost all my space andvi almost cryed I was so angry if you like your games do not get
034580404X|5.0|Once I started reading this book I have not been able to stop finished all three in a matter of a week. I would highly recommend everyone to read this trilogy.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|If you are into the outdoors then this game will make you wish you were there. Nice graphics really detailed and fun game
B000P0J024|5.0|so much fun. Listening t the late George Harrison and Roy Orbison reminds me just how talented they were and what a loss they truly are.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It's perfect and I love the price. It should just get better and better with upgrades. Worked flawlessly out of the box.
B00FAVRFXE|5.0|The Day of the Doctor is an event filled with anticipation only known to Whovians.<br />Watching David, Matt and John together will be an amazing event as they compliment each other's characters and provide us with a breathtaking series of events that will no doubt bring gasps of surprise both happy and a bit angry at some moments among us all following this magnificent show.  I've been watching since the earlier years and the new doctors have breathed fresh air into Universal Awareness of Dr.Who.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun and addictive. Can not stop playing it. I would recommend down loading this game for sure. It is definitely worth it.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I am a huge Lady Gaga (Gaga) fan and I thought Born This Way was a great album, then Artpop came out and I think it is great Aura, Venus, Swine,Jewels and Drugs, etc. there are so many good songs on this album that I can't choose a favorite. For any huge Gaga fan this album is a must have CD.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm stuck on it. Just wish I was better at it. Its a great way to kill time while waiting.
B00C2C637I|1.0|This review is not in regards to the book itself but the format it is in. The numerous typos really detract from the read and this is the not the first eBook I've seen like this I've purchased through Amazon. I'd rather pay a couple more bucks for a quality presentation.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|This was a great Sci Fi movie with lots of action.  Special effects were great.  I have watched this over and over and love it.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|I've finished all the places but, I still play because the game is EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! When I first started playing I thought the controls were kind of hard, but they get easier to understand once you get to the volcano. I got the app when it was the free app of the day. I'm glad I did because I'm not paying $1.99 for an app. I'll<br />Pay $0.99 for an app but just not $1.99. There's 4 places and 4 people. The places are the Granny's house, the city, the factory, and finally Outer Space. I like the city the best and the factory is so ugly! The characters are Granny Smith, Scruffy(dog and get him after Granny's house)Stanley(old man get him after city), and then you get the little blue guy from the app Sprinkle(you get him by getting all 3 apples in each round). The robber can get the apples first, so that's sucks. The characters(including robber) have roller skates and something to help them move like a cane or an umbrella. Some of the levels are really hard, and some are really easy. There's also powerups you find them (and the characters) in the Tool Shed.It's hard to make little jumps because they flip every time they jump. And to go on the zip lines there's another reason why they need their cane umbrella etc.I hope my review helped you:-)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Best book I have ever read. You need to read it NOW. It is super interesting meanwhile it is depressing.
B000UWO8XS|1.0|PICTURE QUALITY WAS TERRIBLE - seemed like a pirated copy of a bootleg. It was dubbed and was hoping for the original audio with subtitles...could have been my fault for not paying attention to the specs but the picture quality is easily the worst DVD I've ever seen.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Fun game.  Keeps me interested.  Haven't learned all the ins and outs yet but enjoying the challenge.  Have not spent any money yet on in app purchase.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|you either love or hate the Big Bang Theory.  This is one of the best and funniest comedies now in production.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I completely love this app. Its so fun and epic.Its just like the movies. the only flaw is it takes up alot of storage space<br />But its still very fun so download it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Easy to Use. But lack of apps to support for the time being. Hopefully, Google will open more apps developer to do so.
B00EW9GQR6|1.0|This album falls flat for me. Not only flat but between the mediocre album, you have the EGO, the immature lyrics, the OVERHYPE, and her pathetic publicity stunts that are oh so tired. It makes you want to tune out.<br /><br />And it's good to see that with such a young fanbase that Lady Gaga continues to glorify the use of drugs on tracks such as Dope. Why are critics giving Gaga a free pass on this? Miley Cyrus gets burned at the stake for such antics.<br /><br />Only a couple decent tracks in the lot. Artpop and Sex Dreams.<br /><br />She's trying way too hard and has alienated the casual listener.<br /><br />It's more a record that a fading star would make.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is really fun and I think your kids would love it. I would suggest this game to everyone unless you have anger problems about winning
B009KS4XRO|4.0|As much as I like this game having played it on Facebook &amp; on my Kindle fire  there's some lagging issues. Also I don't like the fact the ratio of winning a bingo in the daily tournament room makes it impossible to win even one bingo. Other than that the game itself is quite fun.
B009ZAY8MM|4.0|Amazing tracks, and well sung, but I feel like this is generally something that every a Capella group does. This album lacks a style of &#34;wow that's new&#34;
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The other two books I could not put down this one it took me a week to read. I did not get interested until about half way through.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|There is so much wrong with this book - and many of the reviews point out the various issues. I will stick will the most obvious:<br />***Spoiler***<br /><br />Why, oh why, did you so pointlessly kill Tris?? Her death does nothing to help the plot or advance another character's storyline. If anything, it just continues the sadness that is Four's life.
B00BXKKNFS|1.0|Adblocker Plus does not block ads. It does not work. It is a waste of precious storage space. Not a single ad was blocked.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Like many, I have read all of the John Grisham books over the years, while I have waited for a new one to come out, I have read many other authors, this book once again reminds me that Grisham is truly# 1.<br />Believe I will be rereading his books until another new one comes out, soon I hope.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a great game you get to clean your horse feed it take pictures and lots of stuff you can do with your horse trust me you won't regret it.
0385351399|2.0|Mae has just been hired by the biggest and most important company in the US, The Circle.  The California campus have everything an employee could want, making it harder and harder for her to force herself to leave her work environment for the rest of the world.<br /><br />I found the idea of the novel to be interesting.  Innovative internet company, that turns in to a monopoly, which turns into it taking over every aspect of a persons life.  But in general, I found the pace of the story to be really plodding and I had a hard time forcing myself through many chapters.  Partly that was because even though Mae is the main character, I felt like you never really got to know her.  Instead, there was a lot more of the author telling you what each scene is supposed to represent. Instead of allowing you to form your own conclusions during an interesting story, it was much more important that every lesson that you were supposed to take away was spelled out for you perfectly.  As a result, the story suffered.
B005COO1X6|5.0|A quick and quirky read.  Who but King can make a car spooky and scary?  Shades of From A Buick Eight and Christine, but also very different.  It even offers a metaphysical overtone, like The Dome.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This is my first online book review.  I am an avid reader and this is the first time that I am compelled to review a book publicly.  I will do my best to avoid spoilers.  While not a huge fan of the ending or story line, I really felt that Ms. Roth completely misrepresented Four.  I don't feel that his behavior in this book was anything like the Four that I came to know in the previous two books.  It seemed to me that he wouldn't become apethetic and irresponsible based on the things he faced in this book.  He has faced much more challenging obstacles!  Why such a huge change in his personality?  They don't ring true to me.  They do, however, create the perfect scenario for things to end the way they did.  If Four had responded to ANYTHING in this book like he had in the previous ones, this story line would not have worked.  Please rewrite with the real Four!!!!
B004UID2LC|3.0|this will work at first, but in about a hear or so your whole kindle will shut down because of it, so I reset mine...
1451695195|5.0|This book is unique and brilliant, as it presents both sides of reality - scientific and spiritual. The qualifications that Dr. Eban Alexander has offers an amazing opportunity to present a totally balanced account of the reality that we are far more than just a physical body of bone, flesh and blood. It provides indisputable proof of the fact that we are indeed multi-dimensional beings who survive the death of our physical &#34;vehicle&#34;.<br />Judy.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|C'mon - it's Stephen King...has he written anything that isn't 5-star? Oh alright, the gunslinger stuff; but everything else!  This story takes the original Shining and changes it completely, while keeping the tie-in valid and interesting.  A whole different experience, but just as intense, unique and engrossing.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Jillian is a tough taskmaster.  How does she manage to motivate through a dvd?  I don't know, but she does.  She makes me think I can do this, when I just want to give up.  The workout is difficult.  You will not feel shortchanged even though it is less than 30min day.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|it gets boring having to wait for the otherbperson and it shsould leave u logged in cud how rbu supposed to know if its going to or not ...... now I had to delete mine and re download it! !!!!!!! &gt;:(
B001MTENOC|5.0|Love how this book expands my mind. Makes me think out side the box. Great book can't wait to read more.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I've played this game since it began I love playing. It fast moving however I have frozen in while playing the game Yes I did report it but never got my credits back. Also I think there is too much begging for items from first time player's. I think they should at least play the game for a week or so before asking.
B005HSL626|4.0|This game is so addicting and fun. The game is a lot of fast. Most games I get are just ok but this  was amazing  SO GET THIS GAME STRAIGHT AND DON'T LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE THAT RATED IT ONE STAR  BECAUSE I LOVE IT AND YOU SHOULD TO
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Both a mystery and a sad story, told by the dog. It is amazingly set within the world of auto racing.  Well written and unique, I only gave it a 5 because it was so very sad, so many bad thongs happened to Denny. In the end he was the Champion over all.
B0084I9QIW|5.0|Clear video; long playing; I love Michael Jackson and his music. If you are into Michael, this is a must have !<br />He will live on forever.
B006DHAT5K|4.0|Much better than expected.  I normally can't stand Anna Faris, but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Cutish concept and great cameos.
B00DKY4LBW|5.0|Great record, gets better & better with each listen! I cannot get about 4 of the songs out is my head!
0744014956|1.0|The game was a waste of money the guide is as well. Save your money, you don't need the guide to play GTA V. The game is way to simple and it basically guides you were you need to go. The guide is a waste.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very Enjoyable, wanted to read without stopping. A twist to the story, makes Christian change from the man you love to hate to the man you'd love to meet
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This is a great mouse for a great price.  I was using a logitech wireless mouse that started double clicking so I moved to a wired mouse and it is great.  It seemed too sensitive at first, but I just increased the weight and took a week or two, not it's about perfect.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|Well worth the time spent reading. For those with minds who are always seeking connections, this is the book for you.
B006N57PXG|5.0|Outstanding story full of brilliantly crafted, deliciously witty (and  very often hysterically funny) characters, and an engaging<br />plot that moves in unexpected and unusual directions. Far from the trite and overdone, over-hashed, mundane, and over melodramatic (read as &#34;boring&#34; and &#34;been there done that&#34;) potboiler fantasy, this one stands alone as unique and entertaining. It captured me from the start, and kept me enthralled through book 2 and to the very end of book 3 where....at the ending which was simply smashing....I actually cried. I had fallen in love with the characters, deeply wishing the author had continued for many many more books in the series. Alas, it was to be only the three.<br /><br />This is a series well worth reading, and having hardbound additions in one's library for future generations to enjoy.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|This is probably one of the best third person games ever! The graphics are pretty good and the level of difficulty is at the top. The only thing bad is that it is extremely hard to progress without spending real money.
B00G32QIEG|1.0|Never liked Jeff Bridges as a cowboy. Seems to Californian in his way of talking. He cant understand the cowboy way at all.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|All in all nice game good game play good graphics just don't like all the downtime if u don't decide to buy items
B00AB55BS0|5.0|This is by far, one of my favorite series of books and shows ever. The story sweeps you in, and is almost addictive. It's hard to watch just one episode at a time. The blu-rays come with a ton of extra content, as well as a digital copy for the Throne fans on the go.
B007SRLEFS|5.0|This album by Glen Hansard is what I wish every album was. Solid. It is beautiful and haunting. There are no filler tracks. Why can't every artist and album be this amazing. You will not regret this purchase.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so addictive and frustrating.  I don't want to put it down until I get through the current.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works great..a must buy. Turns your TV into a smart TV with needing a game player like Netflix streamer, etc. Had a few issues with Hyper-V and Chromecast working on the same laptop because of the virtual bridge. Otherwise it's great.
B00785P2QC|5.0|great game. love the ever expanding lands to explore and all the new buildings to discover. I spend most of my free time building and destroying to build more.
B0098QBEXO|4.0|Really great movie! Love Cumberbatch - it was very sad. I cried a lot; You probably will too. It's that good (and sad!)
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham's Sycamore Row proves he is still formidable as a writer. I could not put it down anticipating the twists and turns so prevalent in his storytelling. Hope he doesn't wait so long before the next one!
B008NW67E0|5.0|This is the first album that I have purchased by Mumford & Sons. Let me say, it does not disappoint. The band has a fantastic ability to weave older styles reminiscent of American blue grass/folk and even a bit of the Clancy Brothers while at the same time staying modern. Mumford and Sons lyrics are hardly mundane. They speak directly to the soul and substance of a person, without coming off as melodramatic or self-centered. My favorite song  is &#34;Broken Crown.&#34; With religious imagery and angry interjections, the song is both deep and intriguing. Not something I expected from the band when I initially heard &#34;I Will Wait.&#34; They definitely have more to offer than a hollow tune, and I am looking forward to more albums from them.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This story truly inspires and strengthens my faith in humanity and desire to walk closer with Christ. A must read that is quick and easy cover to cover. You won't want to put it down.
B003H8WSLQ|4.0|I really love this album. I listen to it alot while jogging, it just seems to work in that situation.
B00BUVPIRS|1.0|Bought this app, downloaded it and now it will not even install. Lucky it was only a buck for this but not even installing is frustrating.
B009CVRQLY|5.0|amazing! I saw Celine in Atlanta when she could hardly speak English on stage in the early 80's. Her voice blew you away! I have just about every cd she made and she has been &#34;quiet&#34; for a while. She has now come into her own. It's about time! Wow!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Google's Chromecast is an innovative and easy way to stream your computer to your TV. You can watch Netflix (if you have a subscription), YouTube and any Chrome browser page. Honestly that's about it. Google claims it's working to expand this, but development has been slow, and any 3rd party attempts (some of which have been quite successful) have been quickly stopped. So much for open source ..<br /><br />With the right marketing and APK, this device would open up a host of possibilities. It's small enough to travel, and easy to set up. You could pack it with you for business meetings, or simply share your computer with friends. It needs better integration though. What it lacks are items such as Plex (which Google says they are working on) and basic video streaming. Hopefully they will come out with this soon. Users don't like spending cash to wait around on development.<br /><br />I tested the device on my home LAN and it worked without any problems. It connected to my secured router and I was watching YouTube videos within minutes. It remembers the network settings even after power-down, which is a nice touch. I also tested the device at work, with an Android hotspot. Streaming and the hotspot combined were too much for everything (the lag times were long), so I would say to use this as a last resort.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Easy set up<br />Small footprint<br />Low cost<br /><br />Cons:<br />Only stores one network profile<br />Needs a fast network to stream video<br />Needs an open HDMI port on your TV<br />Only works with select/limited providers/options<br />No provisions to explore/expand the device
B00DMEQP2S|5.0|Great price! This was a great deal, I ordered for my son as a gift because I just bought him a vinyl player. He was thrilled and best of all, i loved the price!
B001E75QH0|5.0|THis book is a great series and perfect for my child.  Very interesting story.  Thank you for your writing these.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome! I love how it speeds up as you go along. And my little sister is always begging to play this game on our kindle!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I really love this game but here lately it has been freezing a lot and ive lost several bingos because of it.  other than that love it
B00003OSU4|5.0|There are three wonderful artists featured on this disc:  Louis Armstrong, Mahalia Jackson and Chuck Berry. The inclusion of<br />so many shots of the audience also makes this a very special DVD.
031606792X|5.0|THis book is a great series and perfect for my child.  Very interesting story.  Thank you for your writing these.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|I am a 68 year old woman who really enjoyed all of the great music in this movie.  Was much better than I ever could have expected.  I get it out every couple of months and watch it again.  Never gets old.!!
0385350864|2.0|The first book was great - she should have stopped there!<br />What was funny when Bridget was young and single looks sad on a fifty-something mother of two.<br />Reading page after page of texts messages and tweets gets tiring.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Not quite sure how all the aspects of the game work yet, but, so far it's fun.  We will see how much better or worse it gets as the game progresses.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a pretty fun game but I wish there were more levels. I got through the levels pretty quickly.  Pretty addictive.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I absolutely loved this novel by Deborah Harkness!  She provided a wonderful combination of magic, science, history, and the supernatural to bring the world of Matthew and Diana to life.  The characters are well-written and human with all their quirks and foibles.  The story was well-paced and never seemed to drag.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|if you are a person who likes challenging and make you think games well this game is for you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Told from the guys perspective, a \\"love\\" story full of lol parts that will make you root for the main character. Nothing new here but def something you want to read.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|: I am not sure what to say or how to say just how much I loved this book.<br /><br />The story is about a 16 year old girl who is more or less forced by her parents to join a cancer support group in a basement of a church. There she meets a boy, Augustus Waters. Augustus Waters is just perfect.  With his side “fake smoking” cigarette and his everything that makes him appealing.<br /><br />Characters: The characters were perfect.  I loved them all.<br /><br />Positives: I finished this book at 1:30am.  I was sobbing.  It was breathtaking love story.  It was touching and beautiful and yes sad, but one that will stay with me for a very long time.  I thought about these characters first thing when I woke up the next morning after I finished the book.<br /><br />Negatives:  Nothing. Maybe I would have liked an epilogue.  I am not sure. I just know I loved this book. From beginning to end. I laughed, I cried, I sighed. Loved.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Cannot wait for the movie.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I love what Allie chooses to write about and the illustrations are probably my favorite part. Laughed out loud, probably in several inappropriate social situations while reading on my phone. Loved it!
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is perfect. Love playing and growing the dragons and completing the tasks. My grandson love the colors. The friends you need and the different islands that you can visit. Earning gold and collecting coins.
B00F30S0Y0|4.0|This arrived much sooner than I expected.  Despite the mixed reviews I must say that after listening to it several times I really like most of the songs.  It usually takes a while for me to warm up to an album before I can really determine whether or not I like it.  I think it is definitely worth buying if you are into Arcade Fire.
0441172717|5.0|This is one of the best sci-fi series ever written. Dune tells the story of political intrigue, strategy, theology, and technology over the control of spice melange, a critical component of faster than light travel and the religious group the Bene Gesserit.
B00425S1H8|5.0|Worked great on my Windows 7 and Windows 8 laptops - no crashes or glitches, like with other adapters.  Also tried Keyspan by Tripp Lite but I did experience a reboot/glitches with that one.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|I love this case! It is thin and doesn't overpower the Kindle. It fits perfectly and protects it. Before I purchased it, I saw lots of reviews about there being no holes for the charging port. I just put it in &#34;upside down&#34; since I don't use the camera very much and the holes are exposed for easy charging.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|I love almost every single song on this album. Definite must have for the collection. Will be adding more of their albums too!
078884461X|5.0|fast shipping, just as listed, Thanks
B00EVW0SA0|2.0|This movie was packed full of explosions and fight scenes that were out of place. The story line characterized the Secret Service and Military as incompetent blundering fools. Despite our government's short comings, U.S. Forces would have easily put an end to the fight at the beginning of the move. Don't waste your time.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I love this game. I would most definitely recommend this. I love the fact that it's fun and it challenges you; it's an awesome game.
B00ESY77LO|5.0|If you're a Baz Luhrmann fan, then you'll love Gatsby.  The story line was very close to the book and I would say added some clarity that I had always thought the book lacked.  (Picture says a 1000 words)<br /><br />Highly recommend.
1250038820|5.0|A fantastic book! So happy to support such a great blog. Though many stories are shorter than on the internet version, the quality of the pictures more than makes up for it.
B006CHML4I|2.0|This is the first time I've purchased an &#34;automatic&#34; watch, and while Seiko is an excellent company, and the watch is nice looking, the fact that if you don't keep moving it to keep it winded, it will stop. Which also means that when you take it off at night, it will have stopped by the next morning, and will have to be reset each time. Which in turn, makes this watch virtually useless. I am not sorry that I purchased a Seiko watch-only that I bought this TYPE of watch.
B00GFOIUVQ|4.0|I think this game is challenging and yet fun, but there are some improvements to be made such as the currency. I don't want to have to spend Uru on everything, I would like the option to spend coins or Uru and the wait time for an ally to heal to be reduced greatly. I could spend hours playing if only the levels were a little more plausible to defeat. That being said, it's only been out a short while and I am satisfied with this game choice.
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|very good movie<br />keep you on the edge of your seat<br /><br />bet that there will be another one...hope it will be a good one as well.
B00APVIDFI|2.0|Found that the watch was too small for me to wear, so I never bothered to try it out and see other feature since I could not wear it. The band is for someone with very small wrist. So I mailed it back the next day.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Keeps me up to date! Love it! Love to add all places I've lived!! Great graphics!!! Recommended to everyone interested in weather.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I was so overwhelmed by my emotional attachment to the characters in this series. I will read this series over and over. I can usually predict an outcome but I truly didn't anticipate this. I loved the entire trilogy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I've had this app for a long time and it is FUN I highly recommend to buy this app and even better its free!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|This is pretty cool. You have to jump through a few hoops to get it to cast, which isn't too bad.  Wish it supported more casting options from your iphone.  No hbo go, no sunday ticket. Basically, you can use netflix and youtube.  Apple TV is definitely more versatile.
B007VDN1PA|2.0|I was disappointed in the small plastic windows that you have to slide the film negatives through.  They were hard to keep clean and forced the concave negatives into a flat narrow slot that forced the back of the negatives along the front of the plastic frames.  This caused scraping and fine scratches to appear on my negatives.  I think the unit would have worked better if the plastic frames were designed to hold 5 negatives (one strip at a time in a frame that you set the negative into before inserting it into the scanner).  That would flatten the negative and prevent scratches caused by moving a curved negative through a flat slot of the plastic frame.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Does what is says on the box!<br /><br />Needs support from more apps tough.<br /><br />Spotify, Svt-play and other more local tv-stations.
B004ZG5F3M|5.0|This is a very interesting movie about an outsider comes to a small village and she is determined to win their respect by being herself, selling delicious chocolate, but this happened only with the help of a few outcast villagers.  They were outcast because they were different from the rest of the villagers.  They did not want to conform with the stupid, unsophisticated, unprogressive and close minded small town ways.  In the end she stays in the village because of the love and support she got from her new non-conforming, all inclusive, and progressive new village friends which were about only five of them.  I think she was very lucky she made five friends at this cookie-cutter village.  With her new little group of friends and her super skills of making delicious chocolate treats, she starts a new life here and the villagers started to accept her uniqueness.  This movie also address domestic violence issues, battered women and how a friend can help the victim escape and recover strength to move on from this horrible disease.  Yes I love this movie and thank you amazon and seller for giving me the chance to enjoy a heart warming movie.
B005USZYDU|5.0|My first experience of Theodore Boone and I loved it. Great story and real people. Worth reading the rest of the series.
B002N57KG2|5.0|Great old-fashioned movie<br />Loved it when I was a child<br />The movie arrived in good condition, and it was great to watch it again
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Definitely a challenge... better playing on my tablet than phone! Good graphics. Love all the levels. Can't get enough of this game. I get lost forever in it lol
B000FC0V3E|5.0|Written so a grade schooler could read it with themes that make the writing complex and expansive enough so even the seasoned reader will thoroughly enjoy this work.<br /><br />Beautifully told!<br /><br />EA
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I originally gave this album 2 out of 5 stars and that was after listening to the album a few times.  I am back to tell you all that this album will totally grow on you.  I am so in love with Venus, and I cannot get the hook out of my head.  I love Dope, Art Pop, Sexy dreams, and Gypsy so far..... So I can admit I made a mistake and good on you Lady Gaga, this too is an amazing album.
B002ZG994U|4.0|Good movie. It is a nice modern variation of the old classics that I watched as a child<br />The movie arrived in great condition
0385349947|4.0|I first picked up this book because there was a group meeting at my office to discuss it coming up.  I bought it because I needed to read it for the meeting.  I anticipated that it would be a lot of corporate speak and a lot of unrelatable information from a woman who had an easy start in life, a foot in the door to college and good jobs and a network of people that most of the general population simply doesn't have access too.  Not to mention that I've never been a fan of Larry Summers, who appears to be her friend and mentor. In other words, I bought this book with the assumption that I would hate it and that I would even go so far as to be offended by it (ie a wealthy silver spooned woman telling me why I should try harder so I can be like her.... ).<br /><br />I was very pleasantly surprised. I started reading this on a business trip.  While some parts of it were a bit annoying (oh no my child likes my nanny more than me... I was scared leaving one very high paying job for another one).... I decided to laugh those off and press on.  Instead, I found a lot of the topics to be those that cross over boundaries.  While I still feel that the author is a bit unrelatable, i started to think that perhaps this unrelatable author is still a good conduit for sending this message.  I was most touched by the chapters relating to women feeling like they are frauds. I had never realized how common this is and suffer from this myself, almost daily.  After reading this book I started watching men's actions and really considering their capability, and realizing that I had just as much experience and knowledge as they did... and that women feel like a fraud and men don't.. even when women have more knowledge and experience.  I began to discuss this with coworkers and friends and it has really changed my outlook.<br /><br />Rarely can a book change your outlook.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Chess has been a favert game ever since i first learnd to play it while serving in the army to help pass the time
B008BM9L72|3.0|It was pretty good. I was expecting more.  People kept going on about how raunchy and pornographic it was - all I can say is that they must lead really boring sex lives. Still a good read though
B004EPZ03O|5.0|kids love this DVD, and its good to remember my childhood with this, as well. Good memories
B004LP3AYI|5.0|I enjoy the &#34;hype&#34; that Terry Goodkind generates in his writing.  It built upon the previous book seamlessly, developing the characters further.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|When a story inserts strong visual images in my mind, places me in the narrators voice, and then shocks me with a question...well, that's a rare thing.<br />This certainly ignited vigorous discussion between my husband and me, both after the movie and the book.  My husband thought the entire piece of the island was &#34;over the top&#34; religiously themed... Yes, a twist on the plucking of the apple in the garden of Eden, but in the world that was turned upside down, I like thinking that for once, and entirely plausible in some sense, that it is the plants that are capable of destroying humans, and not so incessantly the other way around.  Creation -destruction at its base , along with the destruction and reconstruction of the human mind and spirit in the face of extreme adversity.  Well done.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I can't stop playing this game! It got a lot better once I figured out what &quot;clear the jellies&quot; meant. Could have used more explanation on this. Instead had to google it. Otherwise fun game!
B0013527I4|4.0|kids love this DVD, and its good to remember my childhood with this as well. Good memories
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|like the game. thought it likes to freez frequently and am unable to purchase in game items. rather wish the developers could fix the problem with it freezing
014241493X|5.0|John Green yet again produces a well written novel. I read this book in one weekend. A must read! Loved it!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|All the characters continue to grow in each and every story.  Preston & Child have written several books that make you want to read through the night.
B002GHHHP6|4.0|humorous gun-slinger movie, with moderate action and under-handed dealing
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Totally addicted to this game. Anyone who hasn't played needs to play. It gives your brain a work out as well.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|People working together awesome! The mixture of countries and robots made this movie awesome times for me. The theme of overcoming adversity to work together is awesome times again!
030789701X|5.0|This is the best Elder Scrolls game yet. I have thoroughly enjoyed playing it and would recommend this book as a great companion to the game.
0425238091|5.0|This is a great medical book to read. It is great for all aspiring doctors to read<br />Hopefully Amazon keeps up on its availability.
B00BUVPIRS|5.0|I get stuck in a couple of parts, there's one time where you have to face these cave trolls and I would be hiding behind a wall and then they see me and kill me in 2 hits. But besides that, it is AMAZING, so many things to upgrade, to buy. This game is literally skyrim, no joke. Talk to different people, get more information to finish your quest.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|This movie was action packed and kept me wondering how is it going to wrap up...until the wrap up...and the wrap up dropped the movie from 5 stars to 3. Just because of the ending.
B00G32OER4|4.0|Movie is similar to Insidious but with heightened special effects, mystery and deeper layer of story telling. Definitely not path breaking but extremely engaging. I may not watch it again but it was a good one time thrill ride.
B001HN6918|5.0|kids love this DVD. Not quite as good as the first film, but still a great movie to watch and to have the kids watch
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Quick read but I found it to be some what predictable. My best description for it is basic. It's not the best book in the world but definitely not the worst. It's more like a quick beach read.
B00BV1P8NG|5.0|Made my daughter extremely happy as apparently Derpy is rare.  Heavier than I thought it would be and a pretty large pony but a nice collectors piece (if she hadn't ripped the box to shreds getting it out when she was overexcited at first sight).
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read and watched as enders life was slowly taken away. He was a rag doll, tossed here and there for people to use. (Spoiler) I also saw at the very end that he made peace with himself and the biggest, understanding what they did and the meaning of it. He revived the buggrrs so they could ultimately live in peace.
6305364648|5.0|A great classic movie<br />Love watching it<br />It came in great condition, and I am overall satisfied with the movie and its condition on arrival
B000KMB5DE|5.0|An amazing book for kids, and to read it again as an adult opens many more doors of the imagination!
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|A very non-typical Hollywood drama about addiction, in particular, alcoholism. As a Probation Officer, I see everyday how much of a hold alcohol has on people and can be one of the most difficult addictions to break. Flight is a great story with exceptional acting from Denzel.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|*A bit spoilery, so reader beware*<br /><br />This book is one of those great reads that will follow you for months, maybe forever.  I finished this novel quite conflicted, knowing how I wanted it to end and grappling with Will Traynor's choice.  As an earlier post mentioned, it has a REAL ending, as opposed to what's going to make everyone happy.<br /><br />Me, Before You begs the question \\"what does living really mean?\\" and makes you ponder life, death, love and everything in between. I find some of the negative reviews on here interesting, especially the ones arguing that someone with a spinal cord injury can live a full life.  I absolutely believe that's true. The greater issue here is having the control over one's destiny and being able to decide what it means to live well and fully. The last scene in the book is one of the most beautifully written \\"things\\" (so I don't give too much away) I've ever read.<br /><br />I found this novel both beautiful and tragic, a fine example of what selfless love can mean, and all in all, a transformative read - which is rare these days.
B000NQRR1Q|5.0|Great fun.. .totally enjoyed.it .I hate it when they require so many words to give a review..Great should be enough!
1442353279|4.0|It was a good read - I did enjoy it. Arnold has a notorious reputation for womanizing and he didn't get into much of that. He basically summed it up in a sentence or two. But even that was OK in my opinion. I really enjoyed learning about his childhood, his move to the U.S. and his determination to do well. It's very inspiring overall. I recommend it.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I am not much  of a reader and when my friend told me to read divergent I hesitated but did it anyway and fell in love  with it. This series will spark your inner  reader and keep you reader fire burning! Thank you Veronica Roth for your artistry in writing
B00F8LPH90|5.0|Loved this game on IPhone, love it here. A good porting of this game, well worth buying. I wish they would have retained the original version's  full weapon access without having to buy it, but you can earn coins fast enough that you really don't need to spend extra money unless you're impatient.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm one of those people who have no problem re-reading books. If I really like one, I'll re-read it multiple times and enjoy it every time. For some reason though, I've never re-read the Hunger Games series. Obviously since the second movie is coming out, I decided to re-read the books now, and they are just as good as I remember them.<br /><br />I find The Hunger Games well written, with each character having it's own identity and a reason to like or hate the character. I cried a few times during this book, even though I knew certain events were coming.<br /><br />I don't agree, nor do I care if The Hunger Games is supposed to be a knock off of other stories. How many times have people written stories about Vampires, or witches, or the high school football star and the nerdy girl? No one cares of those themes are reused over and over and OVER again, so if the theme for The Hunger Games was used before this, who cares?<br /><br />A good story is a good story and The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is a good story.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Don't be fooled by free app. True it is free for the first bit and then there are road blocks and you have to pay .99 if you want to continue on. How else could they pay for national commercials for their &#34;free&#34; game. As far as fun it is a decent game, a time waster but good to play when bored. Their other game with the pets is the same way, play free and then pay if you want to play on. Not happy about that and probably will delete it.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|This album is just amazing. Lady Gaga has really outdone herself, all the songs on this album all have a special meaning. ARTPOP is probably the best album she has done, I love all the songs!

B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book held my interest from he beginning BUT it only held my interest in that I could read for a while and then I would put it down easily.  Around 70% read then I could not put it down.  It was really great from 70% to the end.  And the ending is something I never saw coming.  It was really good.  I did not give it 5 stars because the beginning was good but not great.  Looking back now I would recommend the book highly just take some patience with it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this book so much along with the characters! Christian is amazing. And I must say everyone thinks this book series is smut but in reality my favorite part is the romance and the cute little giggly moments where you can actually feel how much they love each other. It's a great book to read!
B009EP3DJM|5.0|I bought the Target exclusive CD, though I still wanted to give my review for this album. While not a fan of Kesha as a person, her music is undeniably great. She continues to make great music and I don't see her slowing down anytime soon.
1451629192|5.0|Jaycee Dugard was eleven years old when her life was taken away from her. She was captured by a terrible man with devastating intentions named Phillip Garrido. She was kept in his backyard for 18 years of her life, unable to speak her own name. She was forced to be a mother, sister, and slave. A Stolen Life captivates the essence of brokenness and it's affect on the victim. There were two choices; giving up or searching for a spark of hope. This novel is a heartbreaking and traumatic memoir written by Jaycee Dugard that transports the reader into Jaycee's childhood that was brimmed with fear, emotions, love, and most importantly; hope. The way that Jaycee describes her experience is breathtaking. She was taken when she was eleven years old and held onto a strand of hope and dreams that helped her get through the worst eighteen years of her life. She explained everything that she felt, which put a huge emotional effect on the story. At the end of each chapter she had a reflection section in which she would talk in present tense about how she felt about the specific event that she had just written about in the book. Without these minor details, the book would not be as motivational as it is. It would not make as big of an effect on the reader without the details.
B00DYWKPAQ|5.0|Just a short review, I might give this album out to most of my family this Xmas..it's very good..I love it...I wasn't a fan of these guys before I am sure now....From the song Supersoaker to The last Mile Home...vocals and band are amazing!...I'm impressed!

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love this trilogy. Onto the third and ridiculously excited- would have rather had the second end differently but can't complain. Love the erotica although there is quite a bit! Lol. The movie or movies will be great can't wait.
B00E03ULJS|2.0|I was a bit disappointed in this album because I was expecting some hard hitting tracks. Instead, the album seems to be filled with music that doesn't differentiate from the rest of the tracks on the album.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Engaging fictional story based on real life. I was sad when it came to an end. A little predictable, but ending was satisfying!
0060920084|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book,  and won't add any more to the already abundant comments, other than to say his comments about motorhomes were spot on. I had tears in my eyes from laughing so hard.

B00COQKE2M|5.0|An enjoyable album to listen to, Falling In Reverse put out an album to be proud of. Rocking songs from beginning to end, this is a CD I've enjoyed listening to many times.

B008OW1S3O|2.0|A lackluster album, I was disappointed halfway through the album. When I finally got to the end of the album I chalked this up as an album I'll listen to when I'm taking a long drive and I'm not really in the move to listen to music.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Chromecast is easy to use and works as advertised. It is, however, limited to casting &#34;directly&#34; from YouTube, Netflix, Hulu and Google Play Movies/Music. Casting directly means that, once you select a movie/program/video, the selecting device (e.g. tablet/smartphone/computer) can be turned off. This streams directly to the Chromecast module, as fast as the network connection allows. You can also stream from a chrome browser tab, but when you do this, the browser tab actually runs the video, and the Chromecast module taps into that stream. You cannot stop the the Chrome browser, and speed is limited by ability of the computer (i.e. needs a fast computer to stream well). And, you can't stream from Chrome running on a tablet or phone, only from a computer. This is inconvenient. If Google fixes this by either allowing casting from tablet/phone Chrome browsers, OR adding more apps that stream directly to the module, Chromecast will deserve a 5 star rating!
B00E9A656K|5.0|I played this game on other tablets and I really liked it and I am so happy that it came out on the Amazon app store and I like the fact that this game uses real cars but some are over priced by  still a great game
0316055433|4.0|This book is a remarkable achievement.  Tartt's knowledge alone, of topics from the effects of drug use to furniture restoration to art history, are mind-blowing.  The story is indeed a page turner and the character of Boris is one to stay with you for a very long time.  (His use and misuse of idiom is a sheer joy!)  There are passages, such as her description of clinical depression and the way an antiques dealer preys upon the customer's wish to create an image of himself, a \\"stage set\\" for his life, that are perfection.  However, Tartt plays some dirty tricks when we realize she withholds information on the flimsiest of pretexts.  We are also to suspend disbelief when the main character does (and doesn't do) certain things for the sake of her plot.  Finally, some dialogue, especially at the start of the book, is not convincing.  (Both Boris's and Pippa's effusiveness upon first meeting Theo is strikingly inauthentic to me.)  So while The Goldfinch is not as cohesively perfect as Tartt's first book, more rambling and diverse, it is still a wonderful read that thoroughly engages.

B00DWVOPHI|1.0|What ?!  ANOTHER Version of Tommy?!<br /><br />In the day the Who was one of this reviewer's favorite bands. And Tommy is a great composition by any standard. But p-leeease, how many versions and shameless repackagings of Tommy can the music public tolerate? Consider:<br /><br /> In 1969 the Who released the original two-LP rock opera.<br /><br /> In 1970 the Who released an EP featuring selections from Tommy.<br /><br /> In 1970 the Who released an orchestral version of Tommy with London Symphony Orchestra and a bevy of rock stars.<br /><br /> In 1975 Ken Russell directed the movie Tommy.<br /><br /> In 1975 the soundtrack LP from the movie was released.<br /><br /> In 1990 Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab released a 24 K gold CD of Tommy.<br /><br /> In 1993 the Who remastered Tommy and released it on cassette.<br /><br /> In 1996 the Who brought Tommy to the Broadway stage. An LP of course was released afterwards.<br /><br /> In 1996 the Who released a remastered version of Tommy.<br /><br /> In 2004 the Who released a Deluxe version of Tommy.<br /><br /> In 2007 the Who released the Deluxe version of  Tommy in SACD.<br /><br /> In 2013 the Who released Tommy 2013 Deluxe, with songs substantially similar to and containing the same songs and alternative versions as the previous Deluxe version(s).<br /><br /> Now there is ... (drum roll) ... the Super Deluxe Tommy, three CDs with a Blue Ray DVD.<br /><br />Enough already!! What is the point ??<br /><br />Tommy is a masterful composition and will withstand the test of time  -- and will continue to do so, or at least as long as Pete Townshend is alive to re-market Tommy in yet another version. The continual re-packaging of Tommy serves only to diminish the value of this great musical piece. True, between 1975 and 1996 the Who did not re-released Tommy. During that time period Townshend could have, but didn't, release a disco version of Tommy. We must all thank him for that.<br /><br />Even with all the extras in this combo this release reeks of rank consumerism. This release deserves one star not because it is a bad release or a bad musical piece but because there appears to be no other legitimate purpose to this new release other than to further gouge more money from consumers.this release reeks of rank consumerism.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Starts slow, but really builds to a great story. I went right to the next book in the series! The basis for the rest of the series in in this book.
B00F3VOL38|5.0|Nearly twenty years since the first Beatles at the BBC album comes Volume 2, nicely packaged in a double CD digi pack with a 46 page booklet. In my opinion it was worth buying the actual CD rather than downloading the music simply for the informative booklet, with an introduction by Paul, all the track details and lots of photographs. I know you can download it on your ipod, but the actual paper version is easier to read and ideal to peruse while you sit down and enjoy this great collection.<br /><br />It is a slight shame that we don't get to hear the fun openings for shows, such as 'Pop Go the Beatles', which the band recorded specially. However, these CD's are packed with really good quality tracks and interview snippets as the Beatles read out cards and generally cause mayhem in the studio. George reads out a very strange card about the Flowerpot Men (Bill and Ben, not flower power just yet), Paul is asked about his 21st birthday party (not quite the success he suggests, as all fans know!), Ringo calls John a \\"College Puddin'\\" and both John and Paul are heard laughing at George when they are asked about writing the songs for \\"A Hard Days Night,\\" among lots of other interview clips. Most of the songs are excellent quality and they include lots of early hits as well as great cover versions, showing how versatile the Beatles were and giving you an idea of the set list they would have played live in Liverpool and Hamburg. The poorest audio is heard on John singing Chuck Berry's, \\"I'm talking about you,\\" which was presumably worth including because of its rarity. There are lots of early tracks on here which the Beatles never recorded and they give you an excellent flavour of the band in those early days. Lastly, there are four bonus interviews, approx 8 minutes, for each member of the group. Once you have listened to, and loved, this, then (if you haven't already) go and read the wonderful new biography of the early days of the band, [[ASIN:B00CNQ9P6E Tune In: The Beatles: All These Years: 1]], to recreate those heady days when success was just arriving and they were obviously still enjoying themselves hugely.atles: All These Years: 1]], to recreate those heady days when success was just arriving and they were obviously still enjoying themselves hugely.
B00CL1SR7O|5.0|I'm a Big Time Rush fan and I love this album. In continuation with their previous albums, this contains catchy beats, hooks, music to dance to and several songs you play over and over again. Another great album that shows they have not slowed down.
140131046X|5.0|Have a Little Faith by Mitch Albom<br /><br />It was a fabulous story about faith ... all kinds of faith ... and as always, Mitch Albom is<br />a fabulous story teller and his Rabbi is an amazing man of faith. I loved the parallel story of the inner city African American church and their minister. If YOU have a little faith, you'll love this true story.
B00CNQ7HAU|2.0|If you have not read A Time to Kill recently, now is the time to do it. I thought this book was about something all together different yet it kept referring back to that book. I have not read that book in ages so of course I am confused on what Grisham is talking about. Or instead of reading it, you can see A Time to Kill on Broadway with my favorite actor Tom Skerritt in it!
1907360468|3.0|Other ratings said that there was definitions of some of the old world words at the bottom of the pages which is why I bought this particular version. There is not, the defintions are in the back of the book which make it harder to read for someone not versed in old English. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.
B009O07NMA|5.0|I bought this CD without listening to a single track and I ended up loving the album! I bought the Target exclusive version although I'm sure the regular version is still the same minus a few tracks. These guys are absolutely fantastic, talented, and full of promise. I can't wait until their next album comes out. Buy this and you will not regret it!
B00FRQ32N4|3.0|It is fun to play. Pretty easy to pick up and start playing it takes a while to get her new robots. For me it wont let me connect to Facebook do i can't get some of the stuff. But all in all it was fun.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Dance. Sex. Art. Pop.<br />This album delivers and is a total experience from start to finish. Her lyrics are fun yet thought-provoking and her beats make you want to get up and move.<br />There are songs that speak to my soul as well and make me feel what Gaga is feeling.<br />Great for any Little Monster and fans of pop music. Very theatrical at times, but I love that.<br />Many songs (if not most) seems to be written to her Little Monsters and tat is so wonderful.
B008602KQI|5.0|LOVE THIS Movie!!!!!  I read all three books and I have to say even though books being turned into movies is not always the greatest.  This movie stayed very true to the book and had all the major things that happen in the correct order.  Highly Recommend
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|This album starts out awful when you look at the packaging. It looks like something you'd get from a swap meet! The music itself is terrible. The signs of an old man taking his first steps out the rap exit. If kanye was a horse, someone would have shot him and turned him into glue already. After the third track I felt he should have been put out to pasture already.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Once again Grisham has come through!  This book is every bit as thrilling as his others.  If I could have given it 10 stars I would have.
0307120007|5.0|An oldie but a goodie! This has been my son's favorite book since about 6 months of age. He loves lifting the little blue swatch of fabric and playing Peek-A-Boo with Tom, putting his finger through mommy's ring, and kisses the furry bunny. Makes an adorable surprise in Baby's 1st Easter Basket!!! My son is 10 months now and I know find him pulling this off the shelf and  &#34;reading&#34; it by himself.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|This is by far Stryper's best album in a decade. This one has the heavy sound I have been waiting for. If you like a heavy sound, with incredible vocals and a positive message, then you need the album in your collection. Excellent cd!!
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|Long time fan of Hanson, I'm still amazed they're able to come out with such great music after several years in the music industry. These guys are truly talented and if you have any doubt about their musical talent, give their album a listen and you'll end up buying the CD.

This album is so fresh, her vocals are still amazing and each and every song is brilliant, cannot say a bad thing about this album. Standout songs are Loved me back to life, Incredible, Thank you. Ahhhh what the hell, there all standout tracks. Highly recommend this album to not only hardcore celine fans but people who seriously enjoy music. Let's not leave it another six years though celine before releasing another album, I can't stand the wait.
031603441X|5.0|Anyone who gives this book one star must be a member of the Kinks or something. In fact, this book does the incredible service of taking you inside the mind of a great artist at the moment before, during and after creation. It's the gossip, the legends, the stories, but mostly it's the music that makes it great. Best enjoyed with a budweiser in your hand and a stack of records and a turntable in your lap. Rock N Roll!

B00005KHJM|3.0|Amazon apparently lists the same set of reviews for the different editions of the movie, so it's completely unclear whether the one you're ordering is the confusing 88-minute piece of crap, or the longer one that makes sense and qualifies as a good movie.  I'm posting this in the hope that someone knows the procedure for getting Amazon to take note that they're selling different items under the same description.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Best game ever. I will not stop playing. It is so fun. I love to hunt. But when I can't, I play this game.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works as expected and was easy to install. Haven't experienced any problems. Only bad thing relates to playing local content, as chrome does not support great many codecs and formats. However that is a software issue related to chrome, not chromecast itself.
B008P1EWIM|2.0|Given that this app cost some coins, it should have been WAY more feature rich. I wish I had read the reviews online before I purchased this directly from my Kindle Fire HDX. I'll reluctantly give the app two stars for form, but without hesitation only one star for function. Definitely NOT worth the coins. Just use the Silk browser and go to Intellicast (I'm not affiliated, just a satisfied user). It's free.
B008J8KBKY|4.0|If you are familiar with \\"Connect Four,\\" in which you try to put four of your markers in a row without getting blocked by your opponent, and you think \\"4 In A 3D Row\\" will be similar, you may need to think again and expand your expectations.  Yes, lining up four of your markers is there; however, adding the 3-D aspect to the game doesn't just make the game twice as hard, it increases the difficulty of the game EXPONENTIALLY!<br /><br />There is a lot more that you need to keep track of in this version than in the 2-D version.  This game is a lot more challenging, and it is nice to know that I will have the opportunity to build new neural paths for my brain while mastering the skills I'll need to play this game well.  When comparing the difficulty between the board game and electronic 3-D versions of the \\"Connect Four\\" games, think of it as being similar to the difference between checkers and chess.  Both games require strategy, but one will require you to take more variables into account, thus forcing you to think more strategically.<br /><br />It is nice to have the option to decide if you want to play against the computer, or if you want to play against other people, on-line.  A small issue is that sometimes, when I try to see the move that the computer made that gave the computer the required four-in-a row to win, it is difficult to see the line when looking at the screen.  It's probably just a matter of getting used to the new 3-D format, but the rapidly spinning game playing area, along with the colors (orange, red and green), made it hard for me to see the winning play when the move is on the diagonal.<br /><br />Thanks for the great Free App of the Day! :]
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Excellent gameplay.  Have never come across a game quite like this.  Fun little puzzles!  Hope to see more games like this soon!  Well done!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|While there are plenty of great references to &#34;The Shining,&#34; I also think this book is great on its own, with a completely new storyline and concept.
B00FEHXISA|4.0|I don't even remember the 2nd movie, and as I recall, others didn't think it was very good using terms like \\"boring\\", but the first movie and this movie were both enjoyable to me and looked and sounded great with my full digital surround 1080P home theater setup. I like the Marvel stuff as movie material, but that's just me. I'm also a fan of the Star Trek series (I'm not a \\"Trekkie\\", I just like space/science/adventure stuff). If that sounds like you too, then this movie is worth the HD rental price.
0525478817|5.0|Since the time I could read until now as a ninth grader, I have never read a book as good as the Fault in Our Stars. The Fault in Our Stars is an intriguing yet heart breaking book written by John Green that has been touching the hearts of teen girls for the past few years. I say teen girls because most guys don't enjoy reading about love or romantic tragedies. In the book, John uses the tragedy of a young teen, Hazel Grace, who has lung cancer, and turns her tragedy into every girl's fairy tale. Hazel meets a boy, Augustus, who sweeps her right off her feet. Together, you could say that they were almost perfect together, besides some difficulties with them both having to deal with cancer. But everyone knows that in real life, there aren't always happy endings. I won't spoil the ending for you, but I will tell you that you will not see it coming. I think that is one reason I enjoyed reading John's work so much.  He is always throwing you off guard, or he has some sort of major plot twist that you could have never imagined. In the Fault in Our Stars, John uses the elements of loss, love, and even some humor to keep the reader engaged in this book. When I started reading the book, it was so hard for me to put it down. Just when I thought everything was all fine and dandy something would happen and I just had to keep reading. This book is honestly the best book I have ever read, and you should definitely not miss out on the story of Hazel Grace and Augustus Winters in the Fault in Our Stars.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great story, so much more than the movie. Want to keep reading late into the night. Already started the second book.
0451228731|5.0|Firstly, please know that Daemon and its sequel [[ASIN:0451231899 Freedom (TM)]] are one story. You should buy both at the same time so there isn't a moment wasted between finishing the first and beginning the second. You have been forewarned...<br /><br />Secondly, you should know that Daemon is already in development as a Hollywood film. It's that good. While you are waiting for Daemon-the-movie to come out, read [[ASIN:B001NOD0Q8 Ender's Game]] by Orson Scott Card and then see the new film that just came out. (As usual, the book Ender's Game is more complete than the film - being the best team-building handbook I know of.) While you're still waiting, read [[ASIN:0553380966 The Diamond Age: Or, a Young Lady's Illustrated Primer (Bantam Spectra Book)]] by Neal Stephenson. It is outrageous entertainment!<br /><br />Thirdly, consider the fact that 17,000 consciously created ecovillage-communities already exist on Earth below the mainstream-media radar and populated by mostly geniuses and ask yourself why you might still be believing that the thoughtware you were given by modern culture is the best thoughtware that human beings ever invented... by the way, how is your overall life satisfaction these days? Eh?<br /><br />This brings us to Daniel Suarez's Daemon/Freedom story. I love this story (except for the few unnecessarily pages in Daemon describing an incident of drug-induced sexual abuse by the gad guy - which still has the value of warning you what to beware of so it does not ever happen to you...) I love Daemon/Freedom because the degree to which our hero Peter Sebeck is challenged and transformed on the path of finding out what is really going on is, in my experience, the same life-changing risk each of us faces when we dive beneath the superficiality of corporate controlled news. (You might ask yourself: why is the second book titled Freedom anyway?)<br /><br />I think Daemon/Freedom is even more (r)evolutionarily incendiary than [[ASIN:B000I186FW V for Vendetta]] because you get a hint of the powerful stimulation of next-culture communities at play. We are, at heart and soul, villagers. The single fighter image is false. We won't make it alone. Coming together in next culture (after matriarchy and patriarchy comes archearchy...)is our future. Daniel Suarez gives us the 21st Century yellow-brick-road to get there. Come on this journey.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Favorite series of all time. Delayed reading the end of the book because didn't want it to end. You said that's it for now, will you be writing more? Please say yes. Loved everything just a little lost at the end where we're in the babies perspective speaking of her &#34;New Mommy&#34;. But still loved everything. So much to say of this book, loved both Christian, Anastasia, and the rest of the characters. Will be re-reading the series. Please write more. 😊

B00CIVLZ3U|4.0|As always I opened the first page. Suddenly the sun flew across the sky, my stomach tried to claw through my backbone and the final page was done. I cannot think of a single Sanderson book where this does not happen. He went from 'that guy finishing AMOL to one of my all time favorite writers.<br /><br />This was an interesting take on the powers of superheroes. Does ultimate power ultimately corrupt? Do we need them? Or is the hero inside all puny humans?

0618918248|1.0|This will be an informal, unrevised review, as I do not think this book is worth much more.<br /><br />I do not really understand how this book is a best-seller. But that is perhaps due to my own personality as a lover of non-fiction works rather than sensationalist literature as this. I found this book in the \\"Science\\" section at Barnes & Nobles stores, despite it makes arguments in ethics, philosophy, history, and theology but hardly any science. Dawkins is no \\"expert\\" or \\"scholar\\" on virtually anything he asserts in \\"The God Delusion\\" (GD for short).<br /><br />The fact Dawkins continuously boasts in GD to represent some purely scientific, unbiased opinion is laughable. If you need proof Dawkins is about as emotional as a writer can get on a topic, just read his notice on the Old Testament:<br /><br />\\"The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully.\\"<br />(GD, 118, iBooks version)<br /><br />Because this is exactly how an unbiased observer who merely arrived at critical, sound conclusions speaks (yes that was sarcasm)...I wonder how long Dawkins sat around thinking the amount of name-calling language he could use for God. In any event, this language is clearly more emotional than rational.<br /><br />GD claims to show how belief in God is wrong, yet the majority of the book is concerned with the ethical conduct of religion and religion's moral worth, not whether God exists. Dawkins only briefly goes into philosophical arguments for God's existence and only gives the most basic, rudimentary versions of them a philosophy grad as myself know are practically strawman representations of the true debate. There are far more elaborate and in-depth arguments Dawkins is obviously oblivious too. But perhaps just like Theology, he considers Philosophy a useless discipline next to science. This leads to my main point on a field I have read much in and know Dawkins does not know what he is talking about: Theology and/or biblical history.<br /><br />Dawkins only cites ONE biblical scholar for his claims on the origins of Christianity, the historical Jesus, and so forth: Bart Ehrman. Of course, Ehrman himself would scarcely agree with Dawkins in how much he uses the Gospels as important sources in his \\"Jesus Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millenium\\" (decent book btw and I doubt Dawkins read it) for example. But Dawkins makes strong claims with usually no citation or sources like these:<br /><br />\\"During the Roman occupation of Palestine, Christianity was founded by Paul of Tarsus as a less ruthlessly monotheistic sect of Judaism and a less exclusive one, which looked outwards from the Jews to the rest of the world.\\" (140)<br /><br />\\"In any case, as I said, there is no good historical evidence that he ever thought he [Jesus] was divine.\\" (314)<br /><br />\\"Ever since the nineteenth-century, scholarly theologians have made an overwhelming case that the gospels are not reliable accounts of what happened in the history of the real world. All were written long after the death of Jesus, and also after the epistles of Paul, which mention almost none of the alleged facts of Jesus' life. All were then copied and recopied, through many different 'Chinese Whispers generations' by fallible scribes who, in any case, had their own religious agendas.\\" (314-315)<br /><br />\\"The four gospels that made it into the official canon were chosen, more or less arbitrarily, out of a larger sample of at least a dozen including the Gospel of Thomas, Peter, Nicodemus, Philip, Bartholomew and Mary Magdalen.\\" (324)<br /><br />\\"Although Jesus probably existed, reputable biblical scholars do not in general regard the New Testament (and obviously not the Old Testament) as areliable record of what actually happened in history, and I shall not consider the Bible further as evidence for any kind of deity.\\" (328)<br /><br />Out of all those claims, the only one with a source is the fourth, and that is again only from Ehrman, the only scholar Dawkins seems to know about. Ehrman himself is hardly a renowned scholar as he is made out to believe in the media. Though he is an authority in textual criticism, he is no often cited and known authority in the scholarly community for the debates surrounding the historical Jesus and early church. There, names like James D.G. Dunn, N.T. Wright, John P. Meier, E.P. Sanders, and many others are far more known and cherished works. Most scholars like Dunn don't agree with Ehrman on his very cliché view of oral tradition in the ancient world being similar to the Telephone Game or Chinese Whispers:<br /><br />\\"In both cases, however, my main criticism is that these theories of memory have been framed, once again, in a literary culture. They do not take sufficient account of the differences that might have been and almost certainly were involved in an oral culture. In a culture that could not rely on widespread literacy to disseminate wisdom or to propagate particular ideas, where memory was much more trained to the retention of important information, where skills had been developed in society and among groups to ensure the preservation of memories important to these groups, the dynamic of memory was bound to be different.\\" (James D.G. Dunn, A New Perspective on Jesus, pp. 45)<br /><br />Therefore, the only place where Dawkins relies on a source is the only source he knows and, unsurprisingly, shows his ignorance of the actual debates in NT scholarship. As for all the other quotes, he never cites a source and most of them are so wrong, I do not need anymore proof this man never bothers to research. As a history grad, as well, I certainly know such claims without a footnote or endnote or any kind of citationwould earn a paper with them a failing grade in any college-level history course. Historians prize themselves on citations which is often not only a science in citing sources and being critical, but is even treated as another essential part of historical writing for aesthetic reasons. A genuine history book will not lack a plethora of notes and bibliography. Yet on such grand claims like most theologians do not consider the Gospels reliable deserves multiple sources cited. Dawkins gives zero. So to live up to my word, though the \\"nineteenth-century\\" biblical scholarship was overtly skeptical, contemporary biblical scholarship is extremely more positive about the Gospels:<br /><br />\\"Research in the historical Jesus has taken several positive steps in recent years. Archaeology, remarkable literary discoveries, such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, and progress in reassessing the social, economic, and political setting of first-century Palestine have been major factors....the persistent trend in recent years is to see the Gospels as essentially reliable, especially when properly understood, and to view the historical Jesus in terms much closer to Christianity's traditional understanding, i.e., as the proclaimer of God's rule, as understanding himself as the Lord's anointed, and, indeed, as God's own son, destined to rule Israel.\\" (Craig Evans, \\"Assessing Progress in the Third Quest of the Historical Jesus,\\" Journal for the Study of the Historical Jesus 4.1 (2006): 54)<br /><br />Finally, what is strange about refuting all of this is Dawkins prior to trying to assert what biblical scholars and \\"theologians\\" believe actually claimed Theology itself is a useless discipline:<br /><br />\\"I am tempted to go further and wonder in what possible sense theologians can be said to have (italics) a province. I am still amused when I recall the remark of a former Warden (head) of my Oxford college. A young theologian had applied for a junior research fellowship, and his doctoral thesis onChristian theology provoked the Warden to say, 'I have grave doubts as to whether it's a subject (italcs) at all.' What expertise can theologians bring to deep cosmological questions that scientists cannot? In another book I recounted the words of an Oxford astronomer who, when I asked him one of those same deep questions, said: 'Ah, now we move beyond the realm of science. This is where I have to hand over to our good friend the chaplain.' I was not quick-witted enough to utter the response that I later wrote: 'But why the chaplain? Why not the gardener or the chef?' What are scientists so cravenly respectful towards the ambitions of theologians, over questions that theologians are certainly no more qualified to answer than scientists themselves?\\" (202-203)<br /><br />And yet...he proudly boasts later \\"scholarly theologians have made an overwhelming case that the gospels are not reliable accounts of what happened in the history of the real world.\\"<br /><br />Perhaps the reason why he utterly failed to portray the accurate debate among theologians and biblical scholars now is because he does not even think they are worth his time unless they utter something he thinks agrees with his dogma (for dogma it is). Then he announces it everywhere completely ignorant of the surrounding context to it. As I said, certainly nineteenth-century to the early twentieth century theologians ruled by very skeptical German theologians like Rudolf Bultmann believed practically nothing in the Gospels is historical. But today? Not even close. Though I would not say theologians, biblical scholars, and historians related to Jesus and early Christianity are in agreement on traditional Christian doctrines of Jesus being correct, they are certainly not that skeptical anymore. Dawkins may be right that most scholars do not LITERALLY BELIEVE Jesus was divine, but most scholars do believe Jesus, at least, believed he was a divine being in some sense (perhaps not God himself for some scholars though). The very agnostic and skeptical scholar Dale Allison Jr. even admitted:<br /><br />\\"No follower of Jesus, to our knowledge, ever called Paul divine or reckoned him a god. Christians did, however, say astounding things about Jesus, and that from the very beginning. The differing evaluations, I submit, had something to do with who those two people actually were. We should hold a funeral for the view that Jesus entertained no exalted thoughts about himself.\\" (Dale C. Allison, Constructing Jesus: Memory, Imagination, and History, pp. 304)<br /><br />Most scholars today also believe Jesus even worked unexplainable wonders like miraculous healings:<br /><br />\\"In sum, the statement that Jesus acted as and was viewed as an exorcist and healer during his public ministry has as much historical corroboration as almost any other statement we can make about the Jesus of history. Indeed, as a global affirmation about Jesus and his ministry it has much better attestation than many other assertions made about Jesus, assertions that people often take for granted. Looming large in the Gospels and no doubt in his actual ministry, Jesus' miracle-working activity played an integral part in his being able to attract attention, both positive and negative. His miracle-working activity not only supported but also dramatized and actuated his eschatological message, and it may have contributed to some degree to the alarm felt by the authorities who finally brought about his death. Any historian who seeks to portray the historical Jesus without giving due weight to his fame as a miracle-worker is not delineating this strange and complex Jew, but rather a domesticated Jesus reminiscent of the bland moralist created by Thomas Jefferson.\\" (John P. Meier, A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus, Vol. 2, pp. 970)<br /><br />\\"There is an increasingly large consensus that the historical Jesus can be credited with working miracles of some kind, even if only of the more easily accepted exorcisms and healings, rather than the spectacular mighty works such as feeding multitudes and raising the dead. Further, it is possible to make a case that the performing of miracles was an important part of the pre-Easter ministry of the historical Jesus.\\" (Graham H. Twelftree, \\"The Miracles of Jesus: Marginal or Mainstream?\\" Journal for the Study of the Historical Jesus 1.1 (2003): 104-105)<br /><br />Of course an ardent skeptic like Dawkins would NEVER wish to tell his audience MOST of his supposed scholars challenge his own naturalistic worldview that miracles do not occur, hence he is willfully ignorant about it and mocks Theology and any discipline related to it as a waste of time. Then hopes no one catches the contradiction when he suddenly employs it when he thinks it agrees with his worldview.<br /><br />In the end, these are really his only pages dedicated to the history of the Bible, which is the only other field related to religious truth he engages in to an extent beyond philosophical proofs. He has very brief arguments in Philosophy. But, as I said at the beginning, most of \\"The God Delusion\\" is about ethics in and of religion, not trying to dismantle arguments for God's existence or a religion like Christianity's truth. In that light, GD really already assumes the title and claim of the book is correct, dedicating far more pages under the assumption Dawkins is already right rather than trying to PROVE he is right. \\"The God Delusion\\" is a book believed only by the gullible such as Dawkins.

B003XYERRM|5.0|Very well written. Makes you care about the various characters by telling various parts of the story (and history) with their very personal thoughts and voices. Richard III is generally portrayed as a villain. Not so.
B0089LOG02|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read, and I read a lot! Great story, very sad that it's a true piece of our history as a country. Great characters. Just can't tell you how much I enjoyed this book. I've since read every other book she has written. Love this author.
B00EVW0VTI|4.0|White House Down – ok, when you go to Disneyland you know it’s not really magic, right?  But you feel so damn good after a day of suspended belief that it makes the $100 entrance fee worth it.  I splurged and got the $5.99 HD rental of White House Down because, well, it’s a Roland Emmerich film and I expected expertly crafted visuals upon which a Spielbergian child hero would help save the day because gosh darn it, in Roland’s world kids are important.  And the kid inside us is important to us too.  That’s why in 2012 we got to see giraffes and elephants hauled to the arks in the middle of the night be awesome Black Hawk helicopters cuz ya know what?  In Roland’s world Black Hawk helicopter are the preferred method of moving your inner child from place A to B.<br />So what I’m trying to say is that this movie is perfectly awful in terms of plausibility or logical continuity but ya know what?  In Roland Emmerich’s world belief is meant to be suspended in order to enjoy the journey.  If you think about the destination the magic is ruined and it becomes a stinker of a movie.  But in Roland Emmerich’s fantastic universe a sense of humor is just another dimension of the ambience.  And in Roland Emmerichs’s world Tatum Channing has to end up with his shirt off sweaty and smudged by the orgy of exploding  cars, national monuments, bad guys and have I mentioned, Black Hawk helicopters?<br />This movie sucked in terms that a movie critic would understand but my inner child loved it.  There was the right balance of stuff blowing up, emotions being tugged and sprays of bullets that somehow always miss the hero.  You just can’t fire that much weaponry at one human and not have something hit him.  Except in Roland Emmerich’s world where the hero, by golly, actually is invincible against all odds.  And they all get to fly away in a Black Hawk helicopter at the end.  Sweet.
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|Absolutely love this show! There are definitely some shocking moments as well as predictable but overall fantastic. Definitely have recommended this to friends.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Follett's best book in years - doing what he can do better than anyone - teaching history by placing fictional characters in real situations and occasionally speaking with key historical figures. Telling us what life was like for the ordinary and for the rich. When he manages to create fictional characters that we care about BINGO - a great book about England, Russia & Germany just before, during & just after WW I.<br />Hoping parts 2 & 3 follow suit.
B0046A9MRW|4.0|This book was recently voted the Best Crime Novel of All Time by 600 crime writers. It was not surprising that an Agatha Christie novel featuring Hercule Poirot would end up in this position because she was a master of the genre. What is great about this book is the totally unique twist at the end. However, this book has a lot of characters and it is sometimes difficult to keep track of who's who. Personally I believe that Agatha Christie wrote much better books than this. You have to read this book more than once to fully appreciate the mystery. Having said that, I did not like the ending all that much. But you may have another opinion and find the ending satisfactory. At the end of the day, Christie's novels will be read hundreds of years from now, whereas many other present-day crime novels are forgotten no sooner they are read.
B009AQOZIS|2.0|I probably had my expectations set unrealistically high by seeing Steve Harris' name on the record. The songs were just okay and I really wasn't impressed by the vocals nor the bass work on this. I'd rather get an obscure Iron Maiden record with Steve's awesome bass playing.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I absolutely love this bingo game. I have played a lot of bingo games online, but none that measure up to Bingo Blitz. I love that you can play with friends and help others complete rooms. I love the holiday rooms because they are really challenging. The only complaint that I have with Bingo Blitz is that the cost of cards are outrages. They should make the cost of the bingo cards for each room the same, so people can play longer.
B0001KL5DA|5.0|I'm holding out for SFU to come out on Blu-Ray, but if you can't wait and want a cheaper price than the usual $96-$112,<br />Amazon Canada is selling the complete series for $61 CDN which equals about $58 US Dollars.<br />Canada is also Region 1 (North America), so it should play fine on your U.S. players.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|Fab.  Love the genre and the quiet delivery of all of the songs on album.  Been a fan of their group for a long time.
B005KWL2IW|5.0|This was definitely a pleasant surprise. Joey is back and it is definitely the best Anthrax record I've heard in quite some time. I can't think of a bad song on the whole album and Joey's voice appears to have held up quite nicely. A must-have for all Anthrax fans.

B008JFUPK8|5.0|Great Rebirth for the Man of Steel. Sure it has some left out plot holes, but, Superman has been around for 75 years, if you don't know some of the story, You've been left in the dark a little.<br />I do like the sub story as it's told how it would be different for Superman to Grow up as a child. If you've never seen a single superman movie you would be safe seeing this one!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is really fun. It is really addicting similar to temple run or subway surfer but with these adorable minions !
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I forgot that I knew and loved the video before playing this. The characters are just as fun and lovable.

I'll definitely be playing this one a lot and recommend it!!
B00CNQ7CRI|2.0|I loved the Bridget Jones series and was most excited when I discovered the new book to be coming out.<br /><br />I am very disappointed that Mark Darcy had been killed off.  I feel that taking up where they left off<br />still would have been most interesting and that lots of other exploits could have been found for Bridget.<br /><br />If indeed this somehow makes into a movie I will not be adding it to my collection.

(although Sydney had Guthrie Govan on lead guitar- magnificent).

B000YMHOUS|1.0|This movie is merely an apology for immorality.  Essentially the director equates immorality with an interesting and colorful life.  Only after the youth of the town engage in sexual promiscuity do they change from black and white to color.  The director then equates religious scruples with racism.  After the colorful \\"awakenings\\" of the youth, the towns folk began to put \\"No Coloreds Allowed\\" signs in the shop windows.  This was a not-too-subtle swipe at Christianity.
0142421375|5.0|Great clean story. I enjoy reading material, fiction or Non fiction that have a clean story line.<br />I dislike writers trying to impress me with foul words. I hear them even on the television now<br />and hate to hear such foul mouths.<br />I am older, and even when I was in the Army the officers, and noncoms including myself<br />a sgt. never used the words they use on television today.<br />It means only one thing, the people using such language are Idiots. usable to carry on a decent<br />conversation and fill in the voids with black guard.
B000IDCJK8|4.0|This is one of Clint Eastwood's best westerns. It's a gritty look at what the west was most probably like, with the unkempt, lawless and depraved, existing along side upright,and those claiming to be upright citizens.  This film is as good today as when it was first released. The focused, driven, revenge-seeking drifter really does have a name in this film (listen and watch), and the adage \\"Don't get mad, get even\\" certainly applies here, just as it does to Pale Rider and The Outlaw Josey Wales.  If you like Clint Eastwood, hard-hitting, often dark,thought-provoking westerns you should have this and the other two mentioned on your shelf.

B00FLNRN06|4.0|This is a funny movie, with a clever and entertaining storyline and a happy ending- for most of the characters.....<br /><br />It combines the tried and true themes of the fish out of water and the road trip. They're cleverly intertwined.<br /><br />It's helped along by a strong cast- Jason Sudeikis is excellent, as is Jennifer Aniston. The supporting cast are uniformly good.<br /><br />The subject matter, which includes drug smuggling and some adult themes, may offend some people.<br /><br />However, I suspect the majority of viewers will see this as an entertaining and amusing way to spend a couple of hours, without having to wear out their brain cells trying to unravel the plot!

0385341008|4.0|I'm a 14 year old who read this book for my history class.<br />The Year is 1946,London is trying to balance itself after the impact of WWII. As writer Juliet Ashton is struggling to find a subject for her next book, she gets an unexpected letter from a man she has never met named Dawsey Adams. Juliet finds out that this man is a native to the island Guernsey, and came across her name and address in one of her old books she had by Charles Lamb. Juliet is immediately drawn into a new world when Dawsey mentions The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society in his letters. (Originally meant for its members to get a roast pig dinner, but later was found as a fun and pleasant way to pass the time during the German Occupation). When Juliet and Dawsey keep writing to one another, she finds out more about the island and about the charming, funny, and lively people living there. When Juliet starts writing to the other members of the society, she notices how much the occupation affected Guernsey, she is desperate to learn more and embarks on a journey she will never leave.<br />This novel composed entirely of letters written by Mary Ann and Annie Barrows was a great educational read.  It was a \\"none gory\\" way to learn about the occupation while still being very educational.  I learned so much about the time period, and had fun just reading it.  Both authors really made this book come alive.  I give it 4 stars.  Some swearing in it, but a clean read otherwise.
B00FWB6ZBA|5.0|Genesis fans of a certain era (namely post-Gabriel and post Hackett) know that the Banks-Collins-Rutherford trio - in order to include all their \\"hits\\" to their ever-younger demographic audience-- paid what I and many fans consider to be lip service to their Gabriel/Hackett era compositions in the form of their \\"Old Medley.\\"  At various points this included snippets of songs such as Dancing with the Moonlit Knight; Eleventh Earl of Mar; Firth of Fifth; The Musical Box; In that Quiet Earth; I Know What I Like, and others. I recall reading an interview with Phil Collins where he claimed that Genesis came up with this song stew to \\"keep their concerts from becoming three hours.\\"  Well, here's the deal and why that's a lame defense. Steve Hackett's Hammersmith DVD (and CD) show is so amazing. Yes, it's over 2.5 hrs long and that's because for all of the songs I've included in italics above, they are played, completely, from start to finish and moreover, by performers whose talents bring these concert staples to life, making them vital, fun, and intense, a pleasure to enjoy especially for Genesis fans like me who came to Genesis later than the classic lineup and never saw them perform in concert. I cannot applaud Steve Hackett's integrity more, (and, of course, his keen marketing insight) to deliver to his audience not just snippets of classic Genesis songs, but the full deal, in some cases note by note, in others improvising (to their benefit, by the way). If you are a Genesis fan, especially of Wind & Wuthering and all previous albums, I cannot more strongly endorse this concert experience. The picture quality is good (for a DVD that is), and the 5.1 mix is exceptional. It is a pleasure, a momentous event and one you will undoubtedly enjoy over and over again. So, take that Genesis `Old Medley.\\"
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|While I love DT in general, I did not care for their previous album at all.  This is a tremendous follow-up, and gives me hope that DT has a lot of great music left.

B00EVW0SA0|2.0|This is just one of several scenarios in which people would swallow (shoved down throat) martial law, which is to say bring it out into broad daylight or remove the covering of deniability, and<br />so easily choreographed for the high calorie low nutrient crowd.<br /><br />Yes maybe Hollywood is trying to portray the gun toting radical right wing -or-<br />tree hugging disney believing bleeding hearts one way or the other, but<br />this movie and Olympus has fallen will be played over and over<br />until it becomes ingrained in the heads of the very young so that<br />the actual taking down of the white house or twin towers or whatever other national icon<br />becomes a movie scenario on cable news.<br /><br />The most unbelievable part: The aircraft - that type aircraft would've shown up on radar 100 miles out to sea. How did it get so close to land - nay - it was almost to Virginia before interceptors were scrambled.<br /><br />Let's face it; it would take a very well orchestrated plan involving a blind eye turned or<br />actual participation of<br />our most elite institutions to pull this off.
0786962984|4.0|The game is exactly as promised:  Dungeons and Dragons - Lite.  The premise is you select your character (male or female:  rogue, cleric, fighter, mage) and explore the dungeon, fighting monsters, and collecting loot.<br /><br />The dungeon is broken into six difficulties.  My major complaint with the game?  There are not enough loot cards for the dungeon encounters.  I contacted Wizards of the Coast (publisher) asking if there were any missing loot cards.  Customer service responded promptly on Sunday before Veterans' Day!  They said Dungeon! includes 80 loot cards, more than enough for any character to win.<br /><br />In my opinion, there should be enough loot cards for all monster encounters.  Enclosed in the box:<br />Level 1 - 09 monster encounters - 09 loot cards<br />Level 2 - 15 monster encounters - 09 loot cards<br />Level 3 - 22 monster encounters - 16 loot cards<br />Level 4 - 24 monster encounters - 18 loot cards<br />Level 5 - 28 monster encounters - 16 loot cards<br />Level 6 - 18 monster encounters - 12 loot cards<br /><br />My other complaint is the lack of storage.  There are 6 levels of monsters, 6 levels of loot, and 3 different spell cards.  All cards are the same size.  There are no storage items included for the cards (i.e. deck box, card tray, etc.).  Setting up each game requires sorting 15 types of cards.  I made my own tuck box for the magic cards and a 12 slot tray for the monster & loot cards.<br /><br />When I discovered the lack of loot cards, I tried to make a loot table.  I placed the special items (magic sword, secret door reveals, medallions, and crystal balls) on a roll of 2 or 12.  Of five players, no one acquired a special item.  My next attempt to fix the game is to print my own cards, doubling the existing monster and loot cards.<br /><br />This is a great game to introduce people to D&D, I just wish Wizards of the Coast had included more cards and storage for the cards.
B00902AKK4|5.0|There are a few words I can use to describe this app they are: fun, challenging, addictive, frustrating, irritating, and all together a great way to kill time. It seems well made, the physics are generally good. It has a rewind button to save you if you screw up.  It even includes links to YouTube solutions if you get really stuck. All in all a good purchase.
B007NG93CK|3.0|The Bones series on TV have been my favourite for many years. I looked forward to a similar scenario in Bones are Forever but was greatly disappointed. There was no Booth, it was set in Montreal and there were slabs of technical jargon. The redeeming part was Brennan going out on her own and getting into strife.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|I actually started watching this series in the third season (coven). I thought that it was so good I should watch the whole series. Jessica Lange rocks any role she's in. I highly recommended this season.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I cried laughed I think that this book was awesome sad but awesome one of my favorite characters is Prim because she is just so cute I felt like I was in the book when peeta was back with katiniss it was so sweet!!!!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Great game but it needs to be updated for some devices so they can play the beach level and the hover vehicle.
B00A0SLTCU|2.0|It was okay. I was bored about half way through. It's all CGI. I like Arnold's version better. I was waiting until the rental price was lower. However, $9 wasn't low enough.
B00BBA6FMU|5.0|Best book I've read for a while . All about the black slaves & white masters in the American south during the cotton boom , from the slaves point of view. Horrendous to think anyone would treat fellow humans so appallingly . A compelling read about the struggle to live & survive during those times. I hope they make this story into a film . Definitely a 5 star book in my opinion but I'm from New Zealand so find these historical stories fascinating . The Help is another excellent book along the same lines & that film is on our TV tonight 11/11/13 . All the best ..
B00BD99JMW|3.0|This would be the worst way to end a series. The main character dies at the end after all of that leaving everyone behind to suffer. It can't even process. It feels like I've lost a best friend. I can't  hear any of the titles or anything about the series without feeling sad and grieving. Yes I do respect that she brought her mom into her depart as she dies but the way she dies is horrible and unfair. And Tobias I can't even read the epilogue because I know it's going to talk about the after math and I don't know if I could deal with it.
B00EL6AAEU|5.0|This documentary is very disturbing & everyone should see it, whether you've been to Sea World, or are even thinking about going. I just watched this once, about a week ago, & cannot stop thinking about it.  I have been to Sea World once, many years ago & had no idea this was going on. If I had known, I never would've gone. It makes me sick that I basically supported this nightmare. I thought they trained whales that were rescued & couldn't be rehabbed & released. I didn't know they ripped these babies away from their mothers & pods in the wild. I just cried while watching that, then at Sea World taking the captive-born baby away from her mom & seeing/hearing her mom calling for her is so heartbreaking. If that isn't bad enough, the way they are treated in captivity is just sickening. It shows how greedy Sea World is by selling Tilly's sperm too-that is just wrong on so many levels.<br />  It's no wonder they go nuts & attack; I would too. If that's their only way of expressing themselves about being forced to live this way, what else can one expect??<br />  I will never go to Sea World again, & I hope after seeing this, other people boycott the place & it shuts down forever. They talk about preserving a species, yet they abuse them like this. They need to be left alone & not be treated like circus animals for our entertainment.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Great for keeping you Voyager Legend clean, close at hand and fully charged! If you own a Plantronics Voyager Legend Headset you need to have one!
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|This game has incredibly long playability. Not only is my favorite free game on the kindle market, it's my favorite of all games period. Very engaging and fun. No ads, and for that reason, I happily purchased some upgrades for this game. I couldn't recommend it any more highly.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|this is how you turn of the problem with the moose level:<br /><br />1. Throw away your kindle.<br /><br />2. Buy a f***ing IPad.<br /><br />3. Play the game on IPad.<br /><br />Lol... ok that's funny but, how is this game and, are there bugs? Yes, there are 2 bugs, the first, it crashes... second, it makes me crash because it's so f***ing funny XD. I love it.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Device: Kindle Fire HDX 8.9<br /><br />This is a fun game that when played, does not add to your stress level. You get a sense of accomplishment while your completing each level. It's cute to watch the little tree dwellers rebuild the tree as you progress. It is a game for adults & children & once you buy the app, there is nothing else to purchase in order for you to complete the game.<br /><br />I would recommend getting thus app, it is well worth the price for the hours of entertainment you get from playing.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I read the book for a book group and it led to some great discussions! I would definitely recommend reading.
B008J8KBKY|5.0|This is definitely a must have for anyone who is a fan of Connect Four. It's the same old game you know in love with a few cool twists, and it's ideal for both single player and multiplayer.<br /><br />Four in a 3d Row is, as the name suggests, a three dimensional game, so instead of playing on a square board, you're playing on a cube. You place your pieces on various nodes instead of dropping chips into a slot, so you can go anywhere on the board. You still connect four in a row vertically, horizontally, and diagonally along the surface area of the cube, but with the 3d you have a lot more places to go, which can drag out the game in the higher levels of difficulty.<br /><br />This game has a sort of RPG style level up system to it. You start at level one, and you earn experience points for winning games and unlocking achievements. There are four different levels of difficulty; each one has to be unlocked by winning one game on the previous difficulty level. After you earn 20,000 points, you have the option of setting turn-based time limits to add a little bit of difficulty.<br /><br />Now, here's what earns this game a good rating from me. This app comes with the permissions necessary for multiplayer gameplay, and you do have to create an account to participate. However, the devs do it right for this game. The entire online multiplayer part is optional, meaning that internet access is not a requirement to play this game. With online multiplayer enabled, you can access the leader board and see how you stack up to other players, but offline mode does keep track of your personal score. In addition, you can still play multiplayer offline with your friends in person as well as playing the computer in single player mode.<br /><br />With all of that being said, here's my usual breakdown:<br /><br />Gameplay: 5/5 - The 3d board adds a lot more fun and challenge to this game. There's also a tutorial at the beginning which can be accessed again from the main menu. Like I said before, there is single player and multiplayer gameplay available online and offline.<br /><br />Interface: 5/5 - The graphics are brilliant for a game of its caliber, and the controls are smooth and responsive. Personally, I would prefer a bit more of a soundtrack to this game, but that's not a very big deal.<br /><br />Permissions: 5/5 - Permissions are reasonable for this sort of game, as networking is needed for online multiplayer gameplay as well as the leader board. There is nothing obtrusive, no IAP, no ads - I'm quite pleased with this one.<br /><br />Overall, this is a solid 5 star app in my book, and I definitely recommend getting this FAOTD.<br /><br />- Sam

B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Awesome<br />It is an amazing product, I got it for free and I love it!!!!!!!!!! It has awesome features and functionality
B000000Y2R|3.0|This was a live concert from many years ago, 1953, and the original recording was so primitive that even new digital tech could not improve it as much as I would have liked.  But it is a great addition to any jazz afficionado's collection. Glad I have it.  Thanks for making if available.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|Felt that it managed to tell the tale well. It also brought the viewer into the material well enough that you will rise and fall with the video's ups and downs.<br />This is an important movie about what can be done even when hope seems distant. Man's powers of thought and creativity are often amazing.<br />Good location feel, pics are good, acting is done well and the lines are good. As I do not know the full true story so I can only surmise that the movie does a good replication of the event without giving away too many state secrets.<br />All of America should see this movie. Shows what sort of enemy we face in the middle east.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Slow to start and a little confusing, but as  soon as  you get it sorted out you can't put it down. The characters have a humanly mix of good and bad. The  images you can feel as well as  read. The cover illustration is unfortunate in that the book emphasizes that her eyes are dark brown, not blue.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|The volume of the alarms on this &#34;upgraded&#34; app goes from a soft sound to an inaudible sound.  Regardless of increasing the Kindle's main volume or the alarm's volume, there is no improvement.  I tried the settings to correct this problem with negative results, so I went back to the free version.  I LOVE the clock displays on the &#34;upgrade&#34;, but what's the use of using this &#34;upgraded&#34; app if the you can't hear the alarms in the mornings???!!!
B000069KE0|5.0|One of their first albums.  Great music and shows how they started and how they grew as artists.  Love it.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game took what was good with the first game and made it better. It is a fun time waster and a very entertaining game. It has some glitches and bugs but is worth the free purchase.

B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|This is an amazing album, with a little something for everyone. Its a mix of commercial and experimental, and she also really shows off her vocal talent on tracks like \\"Gypsy\\" and \\"DOPE\\". She explores different genres and sounds, like on Jewels & Drugs. Its just a fun album from front to back and incredibly enjoyable.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game to pastime. I have challenged my nieces and nephews and it is a great bonding experience.
B003QSOE0U|2.0|OK, the love story was sweet. And I did enjoy the sensitive way Evelyn tried to handle two lovers after being placed in the middle of a love triangle, through no fault of her own. But for a military nurse, she seldom seemed to work, and when she did, there seemed to be little work to do in the hospital. (With the one exception of that Big Day, of course.) Evelyn seemed to spend the vast bulk of her time off-duty, having fun with Rafe, Danny, and her girlfriends. To watch this movie, you'd think WW11 nurses had an inordinate amount of spare time on their hands.
B008JFUS5A|5.0|i loved the 2nd book so so so so so so much i hope the movie is as good as the book cant wait until they intruduce finnick odair!!p.s.  i highly recomend reading ALL three books cant wait for the movie nov. 22 yay!!!

B001U0HBPG|3.0|I'm probably in the minority here, but I just found \\"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\\" to be a little on the long side.  I loved the idea of it, but it was one of those cases where the movie just didn't live up to my expectations.  My husband thought it was kind of slow, too. I thought Brad Pitt and Kate Blanchett gave good performances, but the movie just didn't hold my attention.  I'd suggest a trial viewing before you go out and buy a copy.
B00FWPWNKS|3.0|Love this game but it freezes up frequently.  Don't know whether to re-buy and hope for a better result or what.
B002EDH0FE|1.0|This was such a stupid movie. Don't waste your money. I am disabled. so I don't get outside much. i watch a lot of moves. Out of say 5000 movies I've watched this was in the bottom 10. It sucked!!!!!!!!!!!11
B00BD99JMW|1.0|If I had known how this series was going to end I never would have started reading it in the first place.  I like to read books that inspire hope and in the end, after all the pain and suffering, good things (like Love) triumph.  Instead, at the end of this book I feel so disappointed and empty that I regret spending my time and money to read it. I already live in a world where all too often bad things happen to good people, so if I want to read about it or watch it I can read a newspaper or watch the news.  I read books because despite all the bad I can (usually) count on a happy ending...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I got a new record from subway surfer for the first time in my life it is a great thing to have in history wall this game is awesome to have in my kindle fire so much.
B008K9SG9K|4.0|I really like the album overall. My favorites are Radioactive (of course - but I don't listen to the radio so I'm not burned out on it) and Tip Toe. I mostly like them in smaller doses though, because I feel like I'm going to get tired of the music when I listen to the album straight through.<br /><br />It's a fun listen, overall.
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|I have been a fan of Kingdom Rush and have been waiting impatiently for Frontiers. It is here and it is terrific. I love all the little visual touches and movie references. I hope they continue to develop additional levels as it is so much fun to play in this world.
0545615402|4.0|I've been a longtime fan of Rowling. In many ways I grew up with the Harry Potter novels.<br /><br />This set is a fun addition for a fan of the Harry Potter universe, and contains neat snippets and additions to round out what we can already learn by reading the actual HP novels.<br /><br />I have only read Tales of Beedle the Bard so far (I read it in an hour or two, very quick read), but will read through the other two soon and update this review then.
1250030951|4.0|Rainbow Rowell's latest doesn't stray too far from the tropes of teen coming-of-age romance, but it carries them out with enough subtlety and humor that even readers averse to the form will be able to have fun with it. It helps that there's a lot more going on than just romantic angst. Cath has been living an isolated but happy existence: she has her devoted but troubled father, her twin sister Wren, and her sort-of boyfriend Abel, but her biggest bond is with Simon Snow, a series of teen fantasy novels (think Harry Potter). Cath is the author of \\"Carry On, Simon,\\" a very popular fanfiction alternative to the as-yet-unreleased final book in the series. She has no trouble writing the relationship between Simon and his archenemy Baz (think Harry/Draco slash), but real relationships are tougher, which is why she spends most of her first weeks at college sitting in her dorm room and eating protein bars rather than brave the dining hall. But new opportunities are everywhere: in the upper-level fiction writing class she's taking, in the roommate who may not be as forbidding as she appears, and in two guys who are much more appealing than reliable but unexciting Abel. Will Cath spread her wings and discover life beyond Simon Snow?<br /><br />Well, obviously. But this isn't a \\"stop being a nerd and have a real life\\" book. Nor is it a \\"romance delayed by ridiculous contrivances\\" book, or an \\"all her problems solved by the final page\\" book. Cath doesn't have to abandon Simon Snow, only balance it with other kinds of pleasure. It doesn't take very long for her to figure out which of her two romantic prospects is the right one, and while there's an unnecessary hiccup on the way to happiness, it resolves pretty quickly. And Cath's family life integrates real issues (a manic-depressive father, an absent mother, a sister too into partying) that neither degenerate into melodrama nor turn out to have easy answers. Cath feels like a real teenager rather than a stereotypical socially awkward fangirl. Her eventual boyfriend is a little too good to be true, but not objectionably so. Dialogue that's clever but no so much so as to feel unnatural in the mouths of college students is the final element in a novel that pushes a formula about as far as it can go. FANGIRL doesn't break any new ground or offer stunning insights into fandom, but it's a reasonably realistic and enjoyable teen novel all the same.awkward fangirl.

B00A1XOPE8|5.0|This is a beautiful story. I love Sanderson and this is no exception - in a book you can read in one sitting he presents a unique magic system, makes you fall in love with a character (and the plight she's fallen into), and executes an elegant ending. I hope he continues to write more about this character/magic system. If you have read more by him this story takes place in the same world that Elantris was written in (though I don't know when this story happens as compared to Elantris, but I think it's earlier).<br /><br />I recommend it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|In love with these books. Can't wait to read the next. Although very erotic, very interesting and keeps you want ok mnemonic g more!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Sanderson is a master storyteller. I cannot say enough good things about this book or this author. I have read (and listened to the audio book) half a dozen times, and I will likely listen to it or read it again before the next book is released in March, 2014. This book is great for fans of Patrick Rothfuss, Joe Abercrombie, or George R. R. Martin.<br /><br />The character development, world building, and story arc all suck you in and make it nearly impossible to put it down. Sanderson is excellent not only because of his vision and his knack for storytelling (which are both considerable), he is excellent because he holds himself to a standard of quality in writing that is nearly unparalleled. He does multiple revisions - complete revisions - on each piece he writes. That means after completing the story - reaching a point where other authors might say, &#34;Okay, let's send this off to the publisher!&#34; - Sanderson goes back through and revises multiple times. Fantasy novels as a genre would be greatly improved if more authors had Sanderson's work ethic and expectation of quality in their own work. I am going to stop here, because if I don't I think I might ramble for another hour or five.<br /><br />My only word of caution is to prepare yourself for the story - it's got great depth and can be a daunting read for someone unaccustomed to epic-length novels. If you want to try Sanderson but are not ready for 1,000+ page book, start with Mistborn or Elantris, then work your way up to Way of Kings.<br /><br />I guarantee you the twists and intricacies of this story will make it worth your while.
B00EPFEY44|4.0|Bought prior to the release for my lovely wife and it came a few weeks later. She likes it, and I like it also. Easy listening type music, with a couple of characteristic high tenor notes make this production a soothing and enjoyable CD.includes a video as well, which we haven't yet seen, but do intend to.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|I personally feel the writing felt rushed. This reads better as a movie script than a novel, which may have had some influence. I felt the other books had greater depth, this book felt &#34;light&#34; in all aspects<br /><br />Like the third book in the hunger games trilogy, it didn't feel as well put together as the first two

B0054XOMX4|5.0|My 6 year old recently got into Beyblades about 2 months ago.  Since then we have accumulated about 30 different beys and 4 different stadiums.  Our first set of beys came from Walmart and were the Shogun Steel series which we have found to be some of the worst ones we have tried.  I decided to do some research and began buying the better rated beys to start his collection.  Amazon was the starting point for purchases since they have a large selection of older versions no longer carried in stores.<br /><br />To date, Phantom Orion (Takara Tomy version) is the king of our house.  It wins 9 out of 10 battles on average no matter what stadium we use.  The only time it can lose more often is in an attack stadium if it gets kicked out, however, it still wins close to 90% of those battles.  The closest competition we have seen is with Hell Kerbecs (Takara Tomy).  Hell Kerbecs, when fully \\"healthy\\" is probably a 50/50 winner against Orion.  However, Hell Kerbec's performance tip is just awful from a durability standpoint so it wears down or cracks rather quickly.  So Phanton Orion is the clear winner here.<br /><br />We also have the Hasbro version of Phantom orion.  Due to the different style performance tip, it is no where near as good as this Takara Tomy version.. Hasbro messed up by not keeping the original design.<br /><br />For reference, some of the other Beys we have are<br /><br />Death Quetzalcoatl (both TT and Hasbro)<br />Kreis Cygnus (TT)<br />Diablo nemeis (TT)<br />Fang Leone (both TT and Hasbro)<br />Meteo L-Drago (TT)<br />Galaxy pegasis (TT)<br />L-Drago Destroy (TT)<br />Hell Kerbecs (TT)<br />Basalt Horogium (Fake ebay one...wasn't spending $30 on a single Bey!)<br />Samurai Irfit (2 versions by Hasbro)<br />Behemeth Golem (Hasbro)<br />bandit Golem (Hasbro)<br />Wing Pegasis (Hasbro)<br /><br />we have many others but these are the ones I can think of right now.  We have several more on order including Flame Libra and Storm pegasis but I;ve seen enoughYoutube videos to know that these don;t do so well against Phantom orion.<br /><br />man...this is an addictive game/hobby!!
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|I enjoyed the movie until the ending. It's like they kind of gave up... And why do we have to insert a &#34;love story&#34; into EVERY movie?? Totally unnecessary.
030758836X|3.0|The storyline was good and interesting, but her overuse of the F-bomb on almost every page and in so many un-necessary ways, took away from this book for me.  I couldn't wait to sell it back!
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I've wanted to learn Spanish for years now, and nothing was working for me. all of my friends knew Spanish and were way ahead of me, desperately trying to learn Spanish from websites. then I found this! it teaches using pictures and it feels like a game! me and my friends now send Spanish emails to each other! this is really a great app. you should press that get app button now!
B0091W0JPE|5.0|A classic movie with the greatest actors/actresses!  It was great in HD.  What else can I say about this great movie
B00C7607FS|5.0|First of all, I bought this for my sister for her birthday. I used my prime membership status to get it to come the Friday before her birthday. It was ordered Tuesday at like 11pm and then arrived Wednesday before 2pm. I was throughly impressed!! The dvd itself if wonderful but what do you expect from a classic Disney movie!! The extras on the blue ray copy was fun too! Overall, a great buy!!
B001NEK2GE|5.0|While I am not going to reiterate too much those reviews who are pages long  I will say this thing works really well and is very easy to add macros.  I have never used macros until I got this thing.  Yes it has a learning curve which is to be expected but the buttons are quite easy to click and there are a LOT of them.  I thought it was overkill till I played SWTOR and my skills started to fill almost every button I had.  The spacing between the buttons makes sure your fingers are rarely lost. This thing is my left hand controller on all MMO's from now on.  The ability to switch game profiles and color code them is icing on the cake.<br /><br />Downside - the thumb controller is pretty twitchy.  I use it to move my character but I am holding right click on the mouse most of the time. Using it without the mouse click would be a huge pain.  I kind of wish it was a bit bigger but it works and doesn't get slick like some rubber ones do (PS3)
B005I4JG80|4.0|Great departure from American parenting books. This easy to read story is a  breath of fresh air, full of level-headed and inspiring advice.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|When is a spy novel not a spy novel? When it’s in the hands of the excellent Ian McEwen, who uses his prodigious writing skill to give us a literary, and very literate, tale of love and betrayal in early 1970s England. Much time is spent in Sweet Tooth recreating a world of striking miners, IRA bombings and an oil embargo that’s disrupting the already fragile British economy. But, for the characters in the book, not much actually “happens,” as more time is spent in contemplation and reflection than their actual movement. But this is not, believe it or not, a bad thing, unless one is expecting to read the kind of novel that would be written by Tom Clancy, for example.<br />We’re brought into this richly-detailed world by Serena Frome (&#34;rhymes with plume,&#34; she tells us),who lives in the present day, and announces, with the book’s first sentences, that she will be recounting what occurred in her life forty-years earlier. Serena was a beautiful and bright young woman who was seduced into a career at MI5 by an older lover with heavy secrets in his past. She was at first only a lowly clerk, and occasionally a safe-house cleaning lady, with a tendency to fall in love with every significant man in her life. She also had a love for literature, or at least read a lot of paperback novels, and on this basis she is given an unusual assignment: MI5 is funding a literary foundation which will discover and support young pro-Western writers, in order to counteract the heavy cultural blitz coming out of communist Russia. Serena must sign up Tom Haley, just such a writer, without ever letting on where the sponsorship money from the foundation is coming from, especially since, for the most part, the British artistic community of the day was left-leaning.<br />That’s pretty much it as far as the espionage aspect of the novel, so any reader must know that going in. However, if you loved McEwen’s Atonement, as I did, you will surely enjoy his perceptive commentary on British society in the 1970s, his often heartbreaking descriptions of Serena’s many loves, and his biting portrayal of the lies and deceptions that go into so many human relationships. Essentially, what this book is about are those very deceptions. Betrayals of Queen and country, yes, but even worse betrayals of lovers and friends.<br />This is also a book about books, with the names of British literary lions and their many works bandied about casually among the characters, who are left to ask what role literature can play, or should play, in indoctrinating the public in one political system or the other. The reading choices of the various characters, whether they prefer books that are classic or just trendy, famous or obscure, also serve to reveal their true selves and their hidden desires. This is truly a book for book lovers.<br />If I had any complaint it was with the ending that was more clever than heartfelt, containing a circular device which makes clear why the narrator is in the present and looking back on events that unfolded in the early 1970s. Unfortunately, I felt in the book’s final pages that the characters that I’d come to care about were not behaving as real people would have, but merely in a way that would allow for the clever ending. This was certainly not such a turn off as to ruin what was otherwise a very enjoyable book, but it did make me enjoy it just a little bit less.on British society in the 1970s, his often heartbreaking descriptions of Serena’s many loves, and his biting portrayal of the lies and deceptions that go into so many human relationships.

B00003CXBK|5.0|I have shown this to grandkids, students, and enjoyed it myself since it first came out. Now, I am replacing VCR tape with DVD to continue sharing this great film.
B0045TYDNC|5.0|It's so easy to lose these guys that you need a couple extra around. They are overpriced for a simple piece of molded plastic.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Couldn't put it down!  Jack Reacher does it again.  Great combo of detective work and intuition, with a little help from his friends.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Well written. Fantastic metaphors. Twisted situations. Relatable stories. This is a story that will keep you awake at night. Best read cover to cover. If you walk away from this story, you might miss something, and trust me, you don't want to miss the messages weaved into this.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|The Goldfinch is a beautiful book. I could not put it down! I recommend it to everyone who loves art and life!
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I love Eleanor. I love Park. And if you have a heart, you will too. Read this book if you are 12…or 22….or 52. A beautiful story that anyone who is capable of love will enjoy.
0553062182|3.0|It has good information, but is wordy and not an easy read.  If you are able to push through, I think it will provide good input.
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|So much better than the last game and the last game was so addictive. Great strategy game for those that love tower defence games. Love the heroes too!
B006S080DK|5.0|This is vintage Helena Bonham Carter.  She is luscious and beautifully groomed in Victorian fashion and style.  As Kate, the daughter of a ruined man, she is being groomed by her terrifying aunt, Charlotte Rampling, to marry into society.  In love with a poor writer, she forms a plan that drives her further and further into darkness in order to marry him.  With any less skilled actor, Kate would become a caricature of a conniving woman.  In this film, she is successfully portrayed as the deeply flawed and desperate woman in love.  Millie, the subject of her plot, is the gentle dove.  The question is one of the transformation of love to lift us above reality.
0007229674|5.0|All I can say is WOW.  My sister picked up this book when she was in the UK.  She read it and said that I must read it too.  I always thought Gordon Ramsay was a big foul-mouthed, loud-mouthed bully after watching him on Hell's Kitchen. A BIG A-hole.  After reading this book I view him in a TOTALLY different way and for the better.  What a childhood he had!!!  My gosh! This book really gives you insight into his life...he grew up totally poor and had a horrible father...he worked his way up to where he is today by starting from the bottom...I have total respect for this man now.  I couldn't put the book down.  I also loved all the pictures he put in there.  And for those who complain about the foul language--this is GORDON RAMSEY---of course the F bomb is going to be in there several times!!  I don't think I would have enjoyed it without some bad language!  haha
B005V20JKI|1.0|I got this game a year ago, and loved it. I came back to play it from the beginning on my new phone, and now the developers are trying to make me pay for it again. That is ridiculous. It would be a five star game, but charging twice is a rip-off!
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I love it because you can explore or make a weapon and play multiplayer but once in a while it lags and powers off my kindle fire but overall its a great game.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|this is a great and fun game I love it. I also love the movie.that is why I gave this game five stars.
B00EVU3T26|4.0|Im one of the few that really liked this movie.It kinda starts slow and I got a feeling that's what lost most people.I stuck thru all the corporate female cat fighting,lezbo stuff and when the dust cleared ..we got a good revenge DePalma thriller.I found vintage DePalma music scores captivating during certain scenes(he's a master at that},split screen scenes{that hes also a master of},very interesting.Confusing at times?? Yes.Entertaining and well done erotic thriller??  Yes! Someone kills the boss from hell...who??? I would like to see more stuff from him if he sticks to the crime thrillers.
B00EW9GQR6|1.0|sonically it's a mess. she's like throwing everything and the kitchen sink and hoping something will stick.<br /><br />her best album is the fame monster. nothing comes close.
0316056863|2.0|I shouldn't even rate this book, because I'm not a pop culture person. I hardly watch any TV, so the references went right past me. The other people in my book group liked it better than I did, although we were divided along generational lines. I have never seen Tina Fey's show, and although she seems quite likable, the book didn't make me want to seek it out. I have, however, seen her hosting awards shows, and she is excellent and talented. I just realized that I have written almost nothing about the book itself, but for me, it was forgettable.
B00005AXEL|5.0|I do not understand why this cd did not become a huge hit. Almost every song is wonderful. It is a matter of taste, I know, but this is one of Stevie Nicks's finest albums. The music inside is as beautiful as the cover. As I recall, this cd was certified gold. I, however, would have thought it would  go on to certified platinum. There is a great song that she did with Natalie Maines of the Dixie Chicks. I don't even know any of the songs by the Dixie Chicks themselves, but this one is called \\"Too Far from Texas\\" and it is terrific. Thank you. Georg Deyab.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I loved this book very much.  Vaelin is a remarkable protagonist.  From his earliest days in the order, he is honed and tested for war.  With training completed, we find so many challenges faced by this character and the many others he interacts with.  I really encourage you to read this.  If you are a fan of military fiction, fantasy, even historical fiction, you will LOVE this book.  Go ahead, don't wait any longer!
B000002WAD|5.0|These songs are nice and lively and are terrific for your boring commute to your  dead-end job. Take it from me. By the way, most singers from England get on my nerves. Adele gets so much radio play that I got sick of her even though she is wonderful. Thank you, Georg Deyab.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|By far the best DVDs combo set I've ever bought. The Digital copy sealed the deal for our family. We have several iPADs and the digital copy is readily transferable to all of our iPADs and family member iPads perfectly. We were using a PC, not sure how it would work on MAC. However, it will ONLY work ONCE. Therefore I can't use the same disc and load on my MAC.<br />Before you enter to code, make sure you know which PC or Mac to use.
B000NA1OXY|4.0|It was such a suprise to hear such a pop-y sound from Avril but this album was fantastic and had some seriously great tracks from soulful ballad \\"Innocence\\"  to the upbeat kickass \\"I Can Do Better\\"
0064404994|5.0|I recommend this book and the entire series! The illustrations are lovely. My son loves this book. He is 8yrs old. The stories are fantastic!
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Love Gaga and love this album. As snippets were released I was worried I wouldn't like all the songs or that they wouldn't come together into a cohesive album. Listening to the whole thing now my doubts have been laid to rest. ARTPOP makes me want to dance, can be enjoyed on many levels and overall is a beautiful work of art by a talented artist. I'm not a musician or artist myself and judge this purely on the way it makes me feel. Thank you Gaga!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Rrrriiingg!  Now...with this app...you can set your alarm for many events, not just waking up at home.  It is handy for travel.  It is handy for travel...goes with you anywhere.

0425263924|5.0|it was so good couldnt put it down cant wait to see whats next with eva and gideon love .
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|Loved this movie, which is a fun addition that's true to the humor and spirit of the Friendship Is Magic series, so I bought the Blu-Ray and DVD set. The bonus features are fine and will entertain a child, but I just wanted to own this movie in glorious 1080p. All my friends love the movie too. We have fun watching it, and I'm not tired of it yet.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Easy to read books on the go and if you have your laptop it makes i even better. Love it.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Couldn't put it down. The author's gentle humor makes it very readable. The orphanage scenes were a little hard to take, but the ending was great!
B00DBEDYDC|4.0|I bought this book after taking a class on just the box pleat portion given by an instructor from a local fabric store.  My sewing guild members were all inspired by the possibilities this book leads to.  While it is not the encyclopedia of manipulation by Collette Wolff, it is very inspiring and the color photographs really help.  At least 10 of our members have incorporated techniques from this book into garments, quilts or bags after seeing the possibilities. And the class was just 2 weeks ago- so they were very motivated by what they saw and learned. Who knew a box pleat could have so many variations?  If you are looking for something that will take your fabric work to another level, this is it.  The techniques are simple but deliver awesome results.
B00C1GBOU6|5.0|I just want to humbly add my 'AMEN' to all the many positive reviews of this fine album, KVEIKUR(I think it means 'burning ember'?!)As a lover of TAKK's sort of military sound on the first cut, & the way they love to shower us in sound, I was hoping for more of those kinds of sound waves & was not disappointed.<br /> I love that Jonsi's boyfriend, Alex Somers was part of the recording & mixing process, perhaps being responsible for some of the interesting new sound elements:  Moments of roaring machines-or what are they...?  Lots of space-travel-take offs and landings--or is it...? - It's your call... Loads of beautiful harmonies & rounds. This albums takes you away & you happily travel...There are quiet times as well...  I cannot stop listening to it. It plays in my mind all the time now-and it' s  welcome there :)<br />  My husband & I had the honor of seeing the \\"Voice of God Band\\"  last spring, practically in our backyard. They were on FIRE! They blew out almost every song, and blew us away in the process.  I knew they could rock-but they really went for it & it was GORGEOUS. The crowd was properly enthralled. So I've been dying to get my hands on this album ever-since.<br /> So if you love their normally more sometimes soothing sound- should you still get this album? Are you fan-enough to appreciate their fresh new rock twist?<br /> Here's a little test:<br />Do you love to play SR & imagine yourself on a journey with them?! CHECK! (this one rocks,but it's a story that unfolds & sweeps you up on it's spikey -sounding wings & brings peace with it)<br />Do you have to sing along even though you have no idea what the words mean?  CHECK!<br />Do you bond with other fans by saying things like \\"YES! I love that song too! Well, I can't pronounce it...but YOU know what I mean.\\" ~ (And the fellow Rossie solemnly nods &  answers \\"YEAH.\\")  CHECK!<br /> Do you endure your big brother's gentle mockery of Jonsi's incredible falsetto b/c, poor thing, he doesn't get it?!  CHECK!<br />Do you know them so well, you even went to see Jonsi live without the band, with his wonderful bf, Alex? CHECK!  (ok I did that! lol)<br />If you can say \\"CHECK!\\" to most of these, you ARE indeed fan-enough to love this album. Congrats-& GO!!!<br />  And this is from a fan who HAS to play & sing along with them on the sweet, not-very-rock \\"With Buzzing in our Ears we Play Endlessly.\\" Every single week.<br />...Yeah, I wrote it in English like that b/c I cannot remember how to spell it in Icelandic/ Hopelandic... but YOU get it. [[ASIN:B00C1GBOU6 Kveikur]] CHECK!!!  <3

B0094BB4TW|1.0|I was upgrading this app and it wouldn't work of this tablet do they know annoying this is right now. NO! They don't .
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I downloaded this app on my Kindle in order keep up with my family.  It is a good way to know just what is going on in their lives.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a very useful app. I find myself using this all the time on my Kindle Fire HD model.  It's easy to access, and the controls are simple. On top of all that; it was a free app. Who could ask for anything more. I certainly can't. Great app!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I play this on Facebook and wanted to be able to play it on my Kindle, especially when I am on vacation.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like subway surfer because you can switch places and change your character when you want and it fallow the season that why I like subway surfer
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|As far as I am concerned, this is a good game.  I find that I am playing several times a day.
B00CLIJ9A6|5.0|If you are  a classical music lover, then this is for you.  Lots of British musicians who are actually playing their respective instruments.  I love Maggie Smith regardless.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Just like the origional movie we saw many years ago. Although it isn't in wide screen mode, we still enjoyed the movie very much.  Have looked everywhere for this movie for many years.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Loved it so much. I think there's a lot of amazing stories that are told in this book and it's my favorite so far.
B001NLL93W|5.0|this book was so good! I was hooked all the way through. evenly paced making you want to keep reading! if you do come across this book, read the first 2 then this one or else you'll be totally lost!
B00AAX68HG|1.0|I hate this app it's so stupid and annoying. It doesn't work right and it doesn't do any thing. I would give it a 0 if I could
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game!! I'm so glad it is finally on Kindle!!  It's challenging and fun and very addicting! Thanks for making it accessible.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE this game!!! Though its not as fun as it is on xbox butbit suits my needs perfectly I HIGHLY recommend toy buy this its worth the money!!! :)
B002R88G5E|4.0|This book showed me the horrors of war but how strong human connections are.  The two stories that run side by side until the war starts and then the fate that brings them together.  While at times a very hard read because it really does bring to life the atrocities of war, the underlying friendship, companionship and ultimately love of another human being was a story I couldn't put down.
B00C7607FS|5.0|Just saw it on blue ray...beautiful! My daughter has always loved this movie and got to give this one to her for her birthday.<br />Thanks for such a quick delivery!
B007EC27QM|5.0|Have several calculators on my phone but since I got this one, I rarely use the others.  Big display, large keys, can see your history.  Great calculator app.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I really enjoy this game. The only problem I have is that the lives I purchase sometimes don't apply to my account. Other then that I like the game
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|my favorite thing about this app is that my kindle screen is so much bigger and easier to see than my phone. I love this game.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Play the game a lot! I do wish there was a way to earn hearts and bonuses instead of asking friends. Especially trying to get into new areas. Seems like everyone is doing other things when I need them the most.
B00F8KIJ2I|5.0|This is the best Avril album in a long while--maybe her best ever. In fact, I think so. Here, you get every version of Avril. You get the toe-tapping teen anthem (17). You get the defiant, frequently foul-mouthed Princess of Punk (Rock 'n' Roll; Here's to Never Growing Up). You get some things that remind you of her teen affectations in those songs and some others (and talking about her teen affectations, take a look at that awful cover photo...). Well, here's to never growing up, I guess, but that sure isn't all that's here--and by the way, I rather liked those three songs a lot. They are rock with melody, not just noise, something she always did well. There are plenty of toe tappers (You ain't seen nothing yet; Bitchin' Summmer; Sippin' on Sunshine; and some of the aforementioned). You get up tempo ballads (like Hello, Heartache), which straddle the middle of the road.    Then, it changes--as if to say, \\"I'm still me, I still rock and don't you forget it, but I can do more than that.\\"    There's also a new vision of Avril here. You also get the sultry, sexpot torch singer (Give You What You Like). How is that song not the biggest hit in the country? Too sexy for the prudish, I guess. Our Punk Princess is all grown up! There is the big, lush duet \\"Let Me Go.\\" Then, there are the sweet, melodic ballads at the end (the charming Falling Fast; the beautiful Hush Hush). This is an Avril that has a direction for the future. She's spreading her wings, brandishing her skills as a songwriter and flexing her muscles as a singer. She's wasn't ever one dimensional, but the mastery of different genres is pretty clear now.    Really, there's only 1 weak song on the whole album--the inane and puerile Hello, Kitty, made for Japan. What in the world was she thinking? Especially since, as an artist she is demonstrating growth, remarkable talent and serious songwriting skill here. Let's not mar that picture.    This was not as commercially successful as it should've been. I know there were some hits here and overall the album certainly did fairly well compared to most artists, but says Wikipedia, as an album \\"it also tallied the lowest first-week sales of Lavigne's career.\\"  That is a shame (but at least it didn't actually tank; still went top 5). There are probably more great and well-written songs here than on any of her other albums and also more maturity on display as a songwriter on most of them. Just shake it off, Avril...a sly reference because...as I write this, I can't help but notice something--another young female singer who is dominating the charts with far less reason. I can't help but make the comparison. This is way, way better all around, better written, more real, more melodic, better sung and showing far more creative skill in all phases. The songs are memorable and distinctive.
B00DHHWXYY|4.0|As a given with most movies, regrettably poetic license is taken.  One obvious value of this movie is a graphic, wide-screened, multi-sensual Jazz-age dimension less available from a simple reading of the novel.  This production arguably verges on spectacle. Regardless, it's well worth viewing.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love a game that really makes you think! It is a great game with wonderful graphics. The music is fun and eery as well.
B004IK9SQ0|5.0|This is a lesson in truth book.  I recommend it for those who are searching for the truth about themselves and that is the only truth.  This is a study book, not a sit down and read book.  The Science of Mind Church is based on the findings of Ernest Holmes and this book.  You can study it with a group, or you can read it and study it alone.
B0091ICDHU|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read!! An amazing story with such loveable characters I could not put down my Kindle!! Highly recommend  a must read. Will and Layken have an amazing story!!
B001MTENOC|5.0|This book explains what I already knew and just confirmed it.  I married my soul mate and he is already on the other side; however, he is with me and has been since he was killed in a mid-air collision in 1982.  We knew we had been together before when we met and were married late in life and only together 4 short years before he was killed.  I have also read Destiny of Souls by this same author, but enjoyed this book the most.
B00000IQW5|5.0|Finally replaced the lost movie.  Such a great story.  Great for an evening of Family time viewing. The story is compelling.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It is one of the best books I have ever read. R.J.Palacio really threw me into the emotions of the character.
B000GPIPVU|5.0|Yes, I said *SWOON* and really, do I need to say anything else?  Awesome CD.  Love this man's voice...it's like smooth chocolate.  Oh my!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|This is coming from the view of a mac user, so it will be different for pc users.<br />So i picked this up to take with me when i travel so i can push media to what ever tv i am using and for this it works great. Its very portable but i own a newer tv (about a year old) and it met the requirement for being able to power the chromecast without using the usb but i lucked out and it still needs the usb power supply, no big deal. This is a great buy for $35 and i've read many reviews that compared it to an apple tv (which i also own) but after using it for a few days i can't see how this is comparable. People compare \\"casting\\" to \\"airplay\\" and the two aren't the same.  When you \\"cast\\" something it only displays whats in the tab and when you go full screen (for a video thats not netflix or youtube) it can't do anything else since the full screen, well... fills the screen and it only mirrors at 720. For \\"airplay\\" when you want to display something you just extend the screen drag it over and when you go full screen it still allows you to use your mac and it will be in the same resolution as your tv (assuming your not using a 4k tv). Also airplay makes the phone into a controller for certain iphone games. So to compare the two seems silly to me. Also the apple tv has the apps built in and has a better interface than any phone. Yet for the price i love the chromecast, its cheap, simple and very portable but its definitely not going to replace my apple tv.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars since i can't go full screen without losing the ability to do anything else on my mac and since it only mirrors at 720 but again i only bought it to use for traveling and maybe on the bedroom tv. Google is a great company so i'm sure that these issues will go away with time and when they do i will change my review but as of now it is what it is.
1594744769|5.0|This is a fun, interesting read.  I like the weird and wonderful.  The photos used are such a great find for which to tell the story!
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|ARTPOP is worth all the hype and wait! I can listen to this from start to finish...no skips or anything! Lady Gaga strengthens my love for her and her music! Mostly uptempo and fun all the way through! Not at all boring and I absolutely love it. Better than Born This Way (which I also loved, don't get me wrong), but this is a great album...hopefully a winner!
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|will not allow me to connect to facebook. everytime I try to log on to facebook, it won't connect. very disappointed in this app.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so addictive,I cannot stop playing! I have coerced all my friends and family to join in on the fun too...well so I can get more lives.
B00APJLEGA|4.0|It's a good movie for kids. I watch it with my 6 year old all the time and it's fun every time.
B009PMEEY2|4.0|Simplistic puzzle/matching game that is highly addictive! I haven't even managed to finish all the puzzles/levels yet. Many hours of fun! :)
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|It's a good game, pretty good graphics, beautiful scene. It's similar to the one on DVD but with different thing. You will enjoy it.
0451418441|4.0|A decade ago, I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Pillars of the Earth.\\" I have no recollection of its story or why I enjoyed it so much.  So, while I did enjoy \\"World W/O End,\\" I did not finish it thinking it was wonderful.  It was good, and it certainly made for a well written and researched story.  But, it was a bit too long at 1200+ pages.  I am old-school, and still like actual paper book.  This paperback literally looks (and feels) like a brick.<br /><br />Ken Follett does a great job at making the bad guys truly villainous.  I was really rooting for their demise throughout the book.  The good guys, however, did not seem as full developed.  I was still glad when they had a good turn, but I did not connect with any of them.  Nevertheless, I do like stories in which there are several characters that intertwine throughout the story.  Ken Follett did that, and it is a feat to tell the stories of 4+ characters over a 30+ time span.  So, I would give this book a 3.5 rating overall - Not a waste of time, but not a wonderful read either.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Was not expecting them to exceed the brilliance of the first movie but darn, they actually did it .. Probably in my top 3 rented movies of the year!

B00ECUARO8|3.0|Ok movie, doesn't really take off like many of Matthew McConaughey's other movies, but not so bad you'll regret watching it.
B000B8L6LI|1.0|Tried it on both kitchen and hunting knives.  Not very impressed at all.  Have sense purchased alternative product and these now sit in a box collecting dust.  Time for a yard sale.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|In today's music world filled with over produced recordings, and artists claiming their name to songs they don't write, Taylor Swift is a welcome voice; a true artist. With RED she takes her craft to a whole new level. This album is truly excellent. Many are quick to dismiss many of her hits as childish and geared toward a younger crowd. I see it as a young talented artist seeking to find her voice, and taking us the listener along for the journey. Those willing to take a deeper look at her work here will find an incredibly soulful artist,willing to put pen to paper and craft many true masterpieces, in both lyric and musical composition.<br /><br />Red is filled with a great mix of deep and soulful tracks such as \\"I almost do\\" combined with the more fun tracks such as \\"22\\" The lead track, RED is incredibly written and performed by this young star on her fourth studio album. This album also contains some amazing gems as Taylor duets with Gary Lightbody from Snow Patrol on \\"Last Time.\\"  Excellent album...highly recommended<br />Also check out this song by song review by Taylor.

0307120007|3.0|This is a classic and it's great that baby can touch, scratch, look and interact with different activities.  My only qualm about this book is there is a page where you can smell the flowers, and I'm not sure that the smelling chemicals are so healthy for baby.  I try to not let my baby use this book very much.
B008MIMWOO|5.0|Great movies and great price. I loved these movies and was able to get them when they were on special. These were the first blu-ray movies I purchased and am very impressed with the quality, I will definitely start buying Blu-rays now.

B003JSSPSY|5.0|Just what I expected after watching some of the episodes. I have both first and second seasons now to enjoy.
0684857219|4.0|Good information but a little heavy on the pictures. I definitely recommend this book, it gives a lot of useful info and techniques. I just would not recommend reading around anyone who is prone to make jokes about you looking at lots of half naked pictures of very muscular men. It will bring you a lot of ridicule and it is somewhat hard to talk your way out of that situation
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Why Why Why did those stupid poopie-heads cancel this series???? Seriously, I have watched the entire (and ONLY) season twice now. Very well-written, with character quirks and humor. The first season did not even touch on each players intrinsics-there is so much more to develop!!!! Even if you hate sci-fi, this is so much more. It is the old west meeting Captain Kirk. I will continue to spout this series merits, and wear my &#34;Bring Firefly Back&#34; t-shirt although 'Mal' is way too busy now with &#34;Castle&#34; to really care!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Great quality and great show. Definitely a must have for any fan of the show. Makes a good gift as well
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|The game is fun but a little too slow.  I would like to not have to wait so long to play the game because I only have a limited time to play.

B0095ZMMCK|4.0|This one may not be truly written by Tom Clancy, but I still enjoyed it, and there are parts where his still shines trough, such as the detailed description of how a fighter key's ejection seat works... I enjoy the little bits of detail like these...
0739378341|1.0|great info on the witness protection program-------it was ok---but not one of his best----I lent to someone who is<br /><br /> reading all the time---she also did not care for it----
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I chose this rating because I love the Dairy of A Wimpy Kid series.I like everything about the book.From what I can remember I didn't dislike anything about the book. I would recommend this book to someone in the third grade and older.<br /><br />I LOVE THE DIARY OF A WIMPY KID BOOKS!!!!!!!! Thank you Jeff Kinney for coming up with an awesome idea like this.
B002VRZEYM|4.0|Great documentary, scary info but very important if you really want to know where the food is coming from. I liked that is not only a very educational report but also tells you a story of people making a difference. Giving us some hope for the near future to come. Very well told and shot.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|NPH is awesome. What more is there to say? The special features make it worth it. Highly recommended! Get It!
1250012570|5.0|As a general rule I'm not a huge fan of books that have what I call &#34;too much reality.&#34; I find I'm either entertained and light-heartedly enjoy a book, or it weighs me down with depression and, again, too much reality. In this book Rowell finds the exact balance. Her characters are intelligent and quirky, yet completely believable. They aren't necessarily beautiful or popular people, but they are very much the kind of people you wish you'd hung out with in high school. The journey they take together, trying to find their own place in their high school, in their families, in the world. you ache for them and the trials they have to endure and ultimately root for them. The ending is perhaps unsatisfying for those who like loose details neatly wrapped with a pretty bow, but it is very satisfying in the reality of it. In this book ultimately it is the &#34;real&#34; that makes it work.
006202406X|3.0|After reading the first two books, I have to say that I’m disappointed in how this series concluded.<br /><br />Plot: The plot is pretty much the same. Face-paced with lots of action, this story will not leave you bored. So much is happening in the story, that I couldn’t  stop reading it.<br /><br />Love: Honestly, I felt like their love didn’t really moved much. They seemed more like friends than anything else. They do have their stolen moments but I feel like those parts are rushed.<br /><br />Ending: Here is what disappointed me the most. The ending. If you read it, then you know why I’m sad about it. I honestly did not expect that happening but it certainly knocked me off my feet.<br /><br />Although the story is good, the end totally killed it for me. I was left distraught for days and really couldn’t get over what I just read.  It just that, when you invest in books and characters, I was really looking for an hopeful ending. For me, this story ended up exactly where it started. Dark and confusing. Allegiant is good.
B00DJZ06DO|3.0|Buyers should know that this is NOT the official English release. It's only in Japanese with (adequate) English subtitles. The audio isn't too bad, but the video quality is a bit poor. It gets pixel-ly In some scenes and almost comes off as boot-leg. I expected as much when I ordered it, but didn't care because I wanted Eva NOW. The official English release isn't due until early- to mid-2014, so unless you're like me and can't wait, and/or you don't mind dropping thirty-some dollars for a lower-quality, bare-minimum package, I recommend waiting till then.<br /><br />As for the story, it took a dramatic departure from the series and is very much a new Evangelion. At its heart, it still remains a character-study and shows many of our beloved characters in a new light. Toss in the enormous amount of incredible (if not somewhat disturbing) imagery and the amazing soundtrack, and you have yourself some entertainment more than worthy enough for your time.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this app. It's a great way to while away some free time. Works as advertised and has some lovely fun puzzles. Def a keeper

B00E8S2KV2|5.0|Man, I love this movie. Unfortunately I haven't seen it in about a year, because I didn't want to purchase the DVD until the extended edition came out. But it was definitely worth the wait!<br /><br />The extended/new scenes are great bonuses, just as they were in LOTR (I actually hadn't seen the theatrical versions of LOTR until after I had seen the extended editions about a billion times, and I always felt like so much was missing). It's perfectly understandable why these were not included in the theatrical version, but I'm so glad they were put in for the extended editions.<br /><br />Of course, similar to the movie, if one is expecting the book of The Hobbit exactly, you'll be disappointed. But what I love about Peter Jackson's Hobbit is that he explores many details of Tolkien's world and tries to bridge the gap between The Hobbit and LOTR. Is it necessary? Not at all, or else Tolkien would have done it that way. But I do think it's incredibly fun and interesting to see things fleshed out more. I know the story of the book well, so it's just great to be able to see Jackson's adaptation, including the addition of things created by Tolkien and things Jackson and his team created--again, it is, after all, an adaptation, and in my mind, a great one.<br /><br />A brief breakdown of the extended scenes:<br /><br />-More of Erebor. You get to see a little more of Erebor and its wealth, as well as more tension between the Dwarves and the Elves--an offering of gems is made to King Thranduil, but taken away once he tries to take it.<br /><br />-Slightly more of Smaug. Not much at all, and I didn't even notice this edition until I read it on another site, but you do see an extremely quick flash of his silhouetted body. Which, on that note, this is one thing that I never minded when seeing the movie--a lot of people wanted to see more of Smaug, but I actually liked this choice better. I definitely wanted to see more of Smaug because of how excited I was to see him, but inthis scene, the unseen Smaug works better, in my opinion. But to each his own.<br /><br />-More of Hobbiton. This was one of my favorite additions--we get to see quite a bit more of Hobbiton (which is now permanently built into the hills in New Zealand--I definitely need to visit that before I die). We see a party much like Bilbo's birthday party in Fellowship but this time Bilbo is a child, and at one point hits Gandalf with a wooden sword, which is completely adorable. Later, you see Biblo walking through the marketplace in Hobbiton as he's shopping and trying to avoid Gandalf. I love Hobbiton, and having these scenes was great.<br /><br />-Probably more of the Dwarves in Bilbo's house. I couldn't tell you what they were, but the scene did feel slightly longer--perhaps just my imagination.<br /><br />-A lot more of Rivendell. All very short scenes, but there's quite a few of them. There's more of the Dwarves eating, including one of my now-favorite scenes where Bofur stands up on the table (quite rudely) and starts singing a pub song (which is actually a song from The Fellowship of the Ring that Frodo sings, who says he learned it from Bilbo. I believe it's Jackson who explains in the Appendices that it's up to the viewer to decide if Bilbo learned it after Bofur sung it, or if Bilbo had taught it to Bofur before--I like both ideas, really). I just love songs like this, and hope to see more in the next two movies. You also see more of Bilbo exploring Rivendell (including looking at the image of Sauron fighting Isuldur behind the shards of Narsil that you see in Fellowship). You also hear Elrond and Gandalf discuss the quest, and the White Council scene is extended as well.<br /><br />-The Goblin King. This is quite possibly my favorite new scene, because the Great Goblin sings a song based on the text in the book. It really adds a bit to his (and the goblins as a whole) character, and on top of that it's just a really fun song. It's out of tune and very goblin-y and torture-filled, but I still loved it. \\"Down in the Deep of Goblin Town.\\" There's various other small bits added to the goblin scenes, too.<br />There may have been a little more of the pale orc, but I can't remember anything specifically. Probably a few other small scenes I missed.<br /><br />I'm really only disappointed with two things:<br /><br />1. That the \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" were not extended. There's more in the book, and I completely understand only having the ones they did in the theatrical version, but I just wish more had been added in the extended edition. This was my single favorite scene of the whole movie (I mean seriously, Andy Serkis just did such a supurbly amazing and fantastic job--Martin Freeman, too), and I would love to have seen a longer version. Ah, well; and<br /><br />2. I wish that the \\"Misty Mountains\\" song was extended. The song in the book is much longer, and I just absolutely love the melody in the movie. I wish they could have made it longer.<br /><br />One thing that I thought was a little funny was how the extended edition is kind of similar to the Fellowship extended editions. Both mark their half-way points (Disk 2) in Rivendell, both have the cast running from goblins in the second half of the film, both start with Hobbiton. . . . Not a bad thing at all, IMO, but yeah.<br /><br />Overall, I love the extended scenes in An Unexpected Journey, and I still love the movie as a whole. I still couldn't help to feel that some of the time the digital effects were a little much. I'm not sure exactly how to explain it, but LOTR just felt so real to me, and in The Hobbit, some things seem more obviously digital. Maybe it's just nostalgia or something, but yeah.<br /><br />The movie also seems to have a constant struggle between being a kid's movie and not. The movie is by far much darker than the book, which I didn't mind, but there's also moments that it seems so close to the feel of the book that it feels much more kid-ish. LOTR seemed to have a much more consistent tone throughout the movie. It had light-hearted (Hobbiton, for example) and comedic moments, yet those scenes didn't seem to change the overall tone at all as it sometimes did in The Hobbit.<br /><br />I also would have loved to have more focus on the dwarves individually. Viewing the Appendices, you can see just how much detail and depth they went into creating individual personalities for every dwarf, but I didn't feel like enough of that went into the film. Yeah, they're still more fleshed out than they were in the book overall, but just knowing how much work they put in to making each dwarf a singular character, it made me want even more for them to be more individualized. However, considering the sheer numbers, I do have to commend them for the job that they did, because that's an extremely hard thing to do. Doesn't mean I don't wish they could've been fleshed out slightly more, though, especially in the extended edition (which they were, but I wanted even more =P).<br /><br />I still wish the dwarves could've had their colored hoods and instruments, I still wish the troll scene could have been a little closer to the book (though I do like some of the changes they made), I still wish the stone giants were just in the distance (though this doesn't bother me too much at all), I still wish the tree scene at the end would've been different . . . but overall I do love the film, especially the extended edition.<br /><br />I have yet to watch the film commentaries, but I suspect I will soon enough--the Appendices, as I've said, were really great to watch, though.<br /><br />Part 7 (which is actually two disks, instead of the usual one--parts 1-6 were covered in LOTR) is titled \\"A Long-Expected Journey\\" and covers a lot of pre-production; includes a great introduction where Jackson explains how the film came to be and how he came to be director once again; the actors' boot camp and various other training; the shooting of the film and the various sets; pick-up shooting; and more.<br /><br />Part 8, \\"Return to Middle-Earth\\" further details the development, design, and production of The Hobbit, and explores in-depth the background of the main characters and the casting for said characters. There's a section on creating the dwarves as a whole, and how Jackson wanted to do for the dwarves what Tolkien did for the elves, and really go in-depth to their past and history and life. It also shows the concepts, creation, and design of the various sets (both physical and digital), and lastly, there's a look at the songs of The Hobbit.<br /><br />The first disk of the movie also has \\"New Zealand: Home of Middle-Earth\\" which is a cool look into the various places in NZ that were used for the film.<br /><br />I always loved watching the Appendices to LOTR, and The Hobbit was no different. I would definitely recommend this five-disk set--the extended edition of the film is amazing, and all the special features/appendices are just really great and interesting, too.<br /><br />Original Film Review Here: [...]<br />Gallery of Product Images Here: [...]

B00EBJ624O|5.0|I have many recordings of the Rachmaninoff 3rd, and was fortunate to have heard Yuja Wang play it with the Oregon Symphony Orchestra.  She, a woman of small stature, is able to play it technically superbly, and at the same time get to the heart of the music.  I feel the same way about the Prokofiev 2nd, one of my favorites of the Prokofiev concerti.  I still like Cliburn's 1958 recording of the Rachmaninoff the best; and, I believe John Browning's Prokofiev concerti (like his Ravel Left Hand concerto) are unmatched.  So, Ms. Wang has tremendous competition with recordings of these concerti, but she does extremely well in holding her own.

B00BXZ3D6Y|3.0|Voice recorder duplicates pitches fairly well. It cannot block out incidental sound and tries to recognize it the voice or music. The result is chipping and whistling. I can still learn tunes from it.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|It definitely wasn't as good as the first. There was a lot of new information to process and so little time. After reading Allegiant.. I'm going to have to rerererereread the others. There was a lot of plot twisting which was good. And a lot of killing. So reader be warned.

B00E6F154A|2.0|I saw Ferry with Roxy Music twice, and once on his own with Chris Spedding. Back then, the irony of a fading pop star being portrayed by a young stud was wonderfully ironic, but at this  point he is a self fulfilled prophecy. The voice is ok, but the band of old rockers just goes through the motions. The bimbo eye-candy dancers are a bit creepy concerning Ferry's age, and while the female sax player is as good as McKay, his eye makeup was better. Get an old youtube video of vintage 70s Roxy, and you'll be better off.
B00BSZZA3I|1.0|i took it out of the box and it was extremely flimsy.  It offered no feeling of security when I put it on the phone.  It was awkward to open it up to use the phone.  I put it back into the original packaging the same day and have not touched it since.  I really should send it back.
0375842209|5.0|When I saw the movie version of The Book Thief was coming out I thought it was the perfect time to finally read my copy of the book that has been sitting on my shelf for some time. With all the lovely reviews I have read I was sure I would love it as well and I was definitely not disappointed. While I cannot say that it is a feel good read in any way it is an incredibly beautiful story and one who's characters I will never forget.<br /><br />First and foremost the narrator of this incredible story is death himself. He's not the usual scythe and darkness death we have seen before but a death who is just doing his job and trying not to get too distracted by the strange lives of the living he passes by. There is a heart beating in that cold chest, one that cannot turn away from our main character, Liesel Meminger, a girl who refuses to let this horrid life she has been born into break her spirit. It might sound strange but, with all the war stories I have read in my lifetime, it is this book narrated by death that presents the most humane and heartbreaking story yet.<br /><br />Liesel is another wholly unique character. Made to go live with foster parents when the Communist label attached to her family becomes too dangerous, Liesel's younger brother dies on the way to their new home. Finding a book in the snow by her brother's grave, Liesel steals the book and resolves to learn how to read it. It is with this first theft that Liesel resolves to steal words when the world takes things from her. However words become so much more to our young heroine: a bridge connecting her to her foster Papa, Hans Hubermann; a way to escape the horrors happening around her, both figuratively and literally; a way to emotionally relate and communicate to the young Jewish man the Hubermanns hide in their basement. For someone who love words as well I became very attached to Liesel and her various ways of dealing with the unpredictable, often hypocritical world she had to try and navigate. How else might a young German girl, a member of the local Hitler Young group, deal with the unwarranted hatred she sees being thrown at Jewish people like the young man in their basement she has come to love like family?<br /><br />I couldn't end this review without mentioning the other unforgettable characters that saturate this story. By far my favorite character is Liesel's best friend, Rudy Steiner, a young boy always willing to do what his heart feels is right, regardless of the danger it might present for himself, and a boy who wants nothing more than a kiss from Liesel. I don't want to give too much away regarding their sweet, innocent relationship but I will advise you prepare and have some tissues when you begin reading the last 50 pages or so of the story. Another unforgettable character is Papa, a man who seems to have unlimited amounts of kindness and another character who refuses to let the propaganda of the Fuhrer dement what he knows to be the right way to be. There are so many more remarkable characters - Max, the young Jew in the basement, Liesel's harsh yet caring Mama, Rosa, the many colorful characters inhabiting Himmel Street - and this collection of humanity makes the ending of the book that much more poignant. I've never quite read anything like it.<br /><br />Anyone who loves reading history from an alternative viewpoint, especially history dealing with WWII, would be remise not to read this book. This is a powerful, beautiful, bittersweet story. It's the kind of story that you will not only never forget but one that, once you have read it, will make you forget what it was like to have not known and loved these characters. Truly a life changing story.How else might a young German girl, a member of the local Hitler Young group, deal with the unwarranted hatred she sees being thrown at Jewish people like the young man in their basement she has come to love like family?<br /><br />I couldn't end this review without mentioning the other unforgettable characters that saturate this story.

B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app because I can't get anything done in silence but the same could be said if I were listening to music. I turn this one with the sounds I love (that makes it sound like I am sitting in a cave, waves rushing past me with crickets around during a thunderstorm while birds chirp) and I can get so much done! I also love to use it after a stressful day. I just turn this on, turn off all the lights and let my mind wander into a new world with the sounds I choose!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Very cute and addicting. You can play with friends and biuld little family's its one of the best games I have played.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Nice game...I just wish they had full Clarksville for kindle...other than that this is a great game and runs good on kindle...I like that they keep all the characters and then some from Clarksville.
B00A285OOW|5.0|This is one of those books that is hard to put down.  So much sadness, power and ambition leading to heart-ache.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was good and they it get bad and then it got ok then it got good so it is good
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|This movie is one that is a classic in my family.  We have now introduced this movie to our kids and they all seem to love also.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Very moving and compelling characters.  I loved the story line between Will and Louisa.  I was moved to tears, great novel!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|EASY TO USE AND GRANDKIDS LOVE IT. THEY WILL PLAY UNTIL BATTERY IS USED UP. THEY ALSO ARGUE OVER WHO WILL BE FIRST. WE USE A LOTTERY SYSTEM TO determine.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|Had to revise my review (wish you could leave no stars).  Still a fun game HOWEVER, the claim that if you make an in game purchase to stop the endless pop up adds is FALSE.  All attempts to contact them about this issue have fallen upon deaf ears.  What a scam to try and get money from people and not have anything change.  Still have all the adds popping up.  Found it odd that no adds popped up until after a review was left and that is when the adds started...I let it go and saw where they said you could get them stopped and yet that was not true.  Very disappointed.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Quick mind exercise...fun to see how far along your friends are too. good strategy builder. Can become habbit forming as it's hard to put down!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Fun, challenging game, no glitches or issues, free, no money spent at all.<br />So far so good. No ads, free, free, free, did I mention the game is free?
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I'm loving the Chromecast!  I wasn't sure I was going to like it when I first purchased it.  I couldn't get it to work at all,  a few days later Google came out with a software update and it's mostly be smooth sailing since.  I now own two and want to give them out as gifts for Christmas.<br /><br />I use with Youtube, Netflix, Play Music, and Hulu.  Would like to see more apps but these are the core apps that I would use anyhow.<br /><br />Can't beat the price and it keeps getting better.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This game is really fun! The only part I don't really like is that some animals you can't get unless you buy it with peanuts. Overall it's a really cool game!
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|The mouse is nice looking and with 9 buttons it can cope very well with all kind of gaming needs.<br />Very high 8000dpi although I don't need more than 4000dpi.<br />Some button placement needs to be considered, like the third button on left thumb and the dpi change button are a bit hard to press or find.<br />But with all aspects considered, it was a good decision to buy this mouse.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app works the way it 's supposed to, it's easy to see the numbers, and it doesn't make me insane with popup ads--what's not to like?
B000JMLFLW|5.0|this is a very great book and i very much enjoyed reading it. there is not much else to say!
B00CDTSFF8|5.0|One might be able to pick this work apart for a lack of perfect historical accuracy, but I found it very entertaining and it shed Scandinavians in as good of a light as their southern European neighbors.<br /><br />The only political controversy was the juxtaposition of Christian traditions and customs with the Pagan with the result revealing how inane both are, yet only one has flourished to the modern era.<br /><br />Two hearty thumbs up to go with the five stars!
B000JQUKKU|5.0|this is a very great book and i very much enjoyed reading it. there is not much else to say!
1596912855|5.0|Being so far unable to see the film, i decided to read the book. soooo much fun and a great parallel to p&p. miss charming was hilarious and the romance yummy.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|great movie. came as stated and packaged perfectly. this movie is great and for the price - definitely worth it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|this game was super fun and I would rate it 4 out of 5 stars.  the only thing that I would change is that the wait time for getting all ur lives is way too long.  there shouldn't be any wait time or certain amount of lives.  also, I think that when they glow up candies to show u a move that u can make they should choose candies that will actually benefit u and allow u to remove jelly or whatever u are doing!  overall a great game.....and its free!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great game!<br />minions are fun.  graphics are cute.  can't wait to see what they come up with next.  get it!!
B00006D295|3.0|This version of the movie doesn't have all the ORIGINAL original songs. A few of them are somewhat different and I prefer the originals. I wouldn't have bought this DVD had I known that. If you're a fan of this movie you probably shouldn't buy this. Try one of the other maybe earlier releases of this awesome classic.
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|I was born in1932 and grew up in Washington, DC, Many. Of the names and events were a part of my childhood. A walk down a dimly remembered. Street!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I love this entire series.  I identified so much with all the characters, but especially with Tris and her struggle to figure out exactly who she really is.  A spectacular series!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I can't believe I put off reading this book for so long.  It is both beautiful and heartbreaking.  Her story will say with me a long time.
B00ELERCO8|1.0|There's no accept button on the terms of agreement. So how can you use this app if there's nowhere to agree and it won't let you go to the next window. Now I understand the frustration of the other reviewer.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This has been the best book I've ever read it's changed me for the better. Great job very well done
B005W0ARFQ|4.0|Kerr makes a good story  from real hapenings<br />I recomend it for those who like WWII referenced fiction.  I value the authors historic information of some characters at the end of the book
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really like this even my 12yr old enjoys trying to out do me! We are really liking it. Really makes you have to use your brain power.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun game .It keeps my attention with a lot of levels to play. It may take more then once but eventually you get it!!!
B00FQAZ7PW|5.0|Thank God for a Rock n Roll album.  This is their best since Vitalogy and is a welcome vacation from the electro-pop crap that is called alternative music these days.  Also, You kids need to get off my lawn.
159514188X|4.0|&#34;Thirteen Reasons Why&#34; by Jay Asher is the story of Clay who receives a set of tapes. As he turns them on, the voice of Hannah (the girl he had a crush on, who recently committed suicide) can be heard detailing the 13 reasons why she killed herself. In the style of a chain letter, each individual she holds accountable will get a chance to hear these tapes. I found this book and it's concept so intriguing that I had to read it the moment the book arrived.<br /><br />The book was very well written and the story kept me turning the page. It did what I think the author was trying to accomplish.  This was to get us thinking about this young girl who, in my opinion, represents so many emotionally damaged young people out there who come to a point where they feel utterly helpless, devastated and so disappointed with this world that they take their own life.  And after the fact, those around them like Clay have their 'aha' moment where they realize, &#34;I should have seen the signs, they were so obvious, yet I missed them.&#34;<br /><br />As I was reading this, I kept shaking the book as if somehow I could shake Hannah and tell her that those were stupid reasons to kill herself.  I would tell her that there was no reason good enough that would justify ending her life.  And also that every problem has a solution.<br />But, then I realized that she was in pain, lost, depressed, feeling alone and betrayed.  At that age, the things that adults see as minor are magnified in the eyes of young people who are barely trying to set their path in the world.<br /><br />I encourage you to read this book even if you don’t find all the reasons believable, because too many of those reasons are as real as they get. And what some consider insignificant and harmless will never be insignificant to someone who is already spiraling down the black hole of depression.<br /><br />I really liked this book  a lot, so I gave it 4 and half kisses.<br /><br />For more reviews like this visit PattysKiss on YoutubePattysKiss on Youtube
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoyed the game. Was hard enough to keep my interest, but not so difficult to get discouraged.  Probably not a great game for die hard gamers.
B00EW9GQR6|1.0|this is her art pop....but to me...it's just art p**p!<br /><br />1. AURA - from and for the film MACHETE KILLS - worthless noise<br /><br />2. VENUS - Venus herself should come down and slap GAGa for this insult to her name<br /><br />3. G.U.Y. - make it stop.....horrid lyrics and beats that make no sense<br /><br />4. SEXXX DREAMS - better left unspoken, cause her sexxx is our audible nightmare<br /><br />5 JEWELS AND DRUGS - pure rap BS meets dance BS....this is why I don't like rap...don't need to hear someone rapping about her private parts!<br /><br />6. MANiCURE - tries so hard to be retro that it sounds like a hot ass mess...which is just what it is when the chorus kicks in<br /><br />7. DO WHAT U WANT - R Kelly can't save this horrid song....stop singing like Christina A...cause you ain't her!<br /><br />8. ARTPOP - someone please explain to her what Warhol meant by 15 minutes...hers was over 20 minutes ago...and this LAME song proves it....<br /><br />9. SWINE - Great beat and nothing else....the lyrics are pointless just more stuttering during the chorus<br /><br />10. DONATELLA - I hope she sues the S*** outta of GAGa....a musical insult to Donatella<br /><br />11. FASHION - the piano opening is the best part of the song...too bad songs about fashion are so 1980...more stuttering chorus...and she sounds off key in several parts<br /><br />12. MARY JANE HOLLAND - starts with a great synth sound and then the stupid lyrics kick in....hard to hear the lyrics for the screaming layers of vocals.<br /><br />13. DOPE - again with the nice piano opening and then BS following it...i.e. the vocals...sounds like she's got high and tried to make music....that only works for Stevie Nicks﻿...and again...sounds too off key and screaming to be enjoyable! And advocating drug use in the chorus is a true WTF moment....\\"I need you more than dope?\\"<br /><br />14. GYPSY - a ballad? not quite - trying to be the singer/songwriter...she fails by falling short...the over production of this song just nails the coffin closed....it didn't need to be a dance tune...should have kept it a ballad....screaming 1/2 the lyrics is not her forte....it just sounds so contrived \\"edge of glory\\" part two! And the stuttering chorus of gypsy over and over shows a lack of lyrical originality.<br /><br />15. APPLAUSE - saving the best for last....ALMOST - I like the visual and the music...it's the stupid lyrics that kill me....when you have to look up the lyrics for a song, it shows, to me, a lack of musical ability. Speak clearly and stop with the multiple vocal overlays....the lyrics are lost in the mix!<br /><br />FREE with my music service subscription....cause I wouldn't give this \\"artist\\" another dime of my money! Can someone please explain to her what Warhol meant by 15 minutes of fame...hers was up 20 minutes ago. I've tried to like her....but she's just not fresh, news, interesting enough for me....give me a real singer/songwriter....not someone who thinks they can rule the world with just a couple quirky songs and funky outfits...d....screaming 1/2 the lyrics is not her forte....it just sounds so contrived \\"edge of glory\\" part two!

B001GKJ2DY|5.0|I wanted a copy of this movie from the time I originally saw it on the big screen so when I saw it for such a good price at Amazon I just had to buy it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy to setup and use.  Great price.  Easy way to convert a TV to a smart TV.  So far have setup 2 computers and 2 android phones to cast to the TV with no problems.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|This movie was so good when I saw it at the theater years ago that I had to get a copy for myself when I saw what a good price it was selling for.  Have watched it many times now.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Our family loves all the Tinkerbell movies. They are some of very few children's movies that reawaken my child spirit. They are beautifully made and the storyline is always uplifting. I have cried a time or two during the movies. Love them all!
000776748X|5.0|If you like adventure on the high seas then you are in for a real treat. Patrick O'Brian wrote a series of nautical tales featuring a pair of unlikely heroes, Lt. Jack Aubrey, RN, and Ship's Doctor, Stephen Maturin. The books take place in the late 1700s through the mid1820s in the Royal Navy. There are 20 books in all, starting with MASTER AND COMMANDER. (the book by the way is MUCH better than the movie)<br />O'Brian writes very well albeit perhaps too well. I occasionally got lost in the mizzen tops and the mizzen topmast staysails but the action is exciting and his characters are well developed. I originally was only going to read the one book I picked up on a trip to Seattle but got so hooked I ended up buying the other 19! They are dirt cheap on Amazon so there is little excuse not to have some fun and sail with her majesty's fleet chasing enemies foreign and domestic! You will find Aubrey & Maturin fascinatingly human, brave (well, usually), and clueless about women. All in all, it is a fun diversion I heartily recommend them when you are tired of relevance and the news.
B00881VLCE|4.0|It's really difficult to find a good jigsaw game. This isn't the best but it's a good starter game. Would probably be great for kids.
B000ICKPOQ|1.0|So far from what I have seen, all the subtitles in both season 1 and season 2 are out of sync. I suspect they are the same for all the other seasons. The show deserves 5 stars but any stream or download that does not include insync subtitles deserves zero stars.
B008JEJOCY|4.0|Was surprised that they are as comfortable as they are, will get more use than originally intended to. Nice surprise
0783226063|5.0|I love this story. The film follows the book somewhat but skips a lot that would slow down the action. Would recommend this film to anyone interested in space fantasy or futuristic world fantasy.
B00GHJ6BJW|4.0|In my opinion, this is not her best album. Don't get me wrong, I still like it. Maybe I'm not a true Little Monster... That's okay though. I'd rather be part of the Britney Army anyway. ;)
B0093LINVK|4.0|I am using this as a Ubuntu home server for doing some development for a website idea I am playing around with. I did have some problems choosing a distro because some seemed to struggle with the install, but once everything has gotten up and running, it has stayed on for the past 2 months with no downtime.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend this for an inexpensive little linux box. Just be aware that this is not a complete system, and you will need to get compatible memory and storage.
B000I9X6HW|1.0|The movie is good, but the quality of the videos on Amazon is very poor. Couldn't get through even the first minute of the movie without pausing repeatedly.
B008N1V11U|5.0|I love batman and I love this game get this app you will like it I promise<br />Ps.get the amazing Spiderman that's also good and arckarm origins to
1419705849|1.0|Our neighbor let my 7 year old borrow on the these books. I didnt hesitate to let him read because i was so excited he was interested in it. After picking it up im shocked. I couldnt agree any more with others who have given this book a one star. I had faith in my neighbor that she was as protective on our kids character as i am. Its ok. I dont think anyone is a bad parent for letting their kids read this book. However, i personally am not interested in letting my son.<br /><br />  I am believe kids emulate what they see and relate to (so reading included). My son loves \\"Kickin It\\" and emulates Jack. I dont mind. Jack is a great kid. But this kid Greg is not someone who my son should be like. I try and teach my son to not judge people. Which is hard enough to do these days. Which this kid Greg does countless times. I teach my son that for every action there will be a reaction. So, when you do something wrong, you will suffer the consequences. This book only shows that there is no consequences if you dont get caught. Our children are undated with crap all day long. I want my son to read  characters that he can find good in. Emulate that behavior. Look around and find virtuous people in stories my son can read. Its not easy to find those. Teaching our son that life isnt fair. We are NOT entitled to anything that we dont do for ourselves. That bad things will happen to us and that its up to us on how to handle those things. That is what i want my son to know. Not whining. poor me attitude.<br /><br /> And for people that think this book is just for \\"fun\\" and that it doesnt mean much. I would say. Maybe you're right. But i think that my son is too impressionable to be risking with useless garbage like this.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I find this app Finn and relaxing the music is beautiful and calming the puzzles come in different difficulties and different pictures to make
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|:) this is a great game but it is very addicting. It's fun to try to beat your friends. enjoy hours of fun!
B00BMKH5NW|4.0|This was a really good book! It was all about family, coming of age and learning to let others in. I was pulled in the whole time. I just loved Levi and Cath. She grew so much since she met Levi and I loved the interactions between Cath and her twin sister Wren. I loved their relationship and was so glad they found their way back to each other. The only thing that didn't make this 5 stars for me was the abrupt ending. I think there could have been more. I wanted more Levi and Cath relationship development. It's like once they started making out, that was the end of their growth as a couple. But maybe that's just me and my need for a little more steam in my books lol and I wanted to know what happened more between Simon and Baz in her Carry On fanfic. It also would've been nice to read her Fiction-Writing essay and get the professors reaction, but I can see how that wasn't necessary. Also I wanted more about Wren. Basically I just wanted more at the end. But overall it was a great read and kept me interested the entire time. A must read!
B00DWHWOFC|5.0|These puzzles are fairly challenging but I really like trying to guess what the picture will be as I work on it.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|I see parallels with Atlas Shrugged, which was also about a young professional woman in a powerful company and the loss of the individual. I enjoyed both books and highly recommend them.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|The &#34;Movie&#34; and &#34;Features.&#34;  are very informative and entertaining.  The Disk was  Timely Delivered and in Excellent Condition - Great 2 Disk Movie and Features to watch again and again.
B009NF54ZE|3.0|Way too much dialogue. Too much reading to get to the games. The reading is tedious and I find myself just tapping to get though all of the dialogue in stead of actually reading the any of the story. I've played many of these types of games and this one is truly the most frustrating. The games themselves are pretty easy, some times much too easy not even taking 1/4th the time given to solve.
B0019IIPXQ|5.0|This is a great indie action movie.  Vin Diesel just growls and mugs his way through.  So much fun.  Fast paced and keeps you interested.
B004H4XI5O|3.0|This was a pretty good read, the titles misleading but all in all not a bad book. Three more words.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|This is an awesome CD!  A little Conderella, a taste of Bon Jovi and Tom Keifer at his best.  So glad I bought this CD.  I will play this one to death.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|love devising different strategies to fulfilled the challenges. glad all the challenges are different enough that you can't always just breeze through.
B005J29HCQ|5.0|Really like this album. Nostalgic yet modern. Too bad Brian wasn't supported at the time he wrote these, I really think it would have all been a hit.
B005LAII0I|5.0|Just a fun movie!This is a  family flick that all can enjoy.........it has brilliant scenery and just fun to watch!
B003O86FMW|5.0|It only took me a few days to read this book. I honestly didn't want to put it down. I loved reading from a different aspect of the games. This book flew by much faster than the first one. Still and excellent read that I would re commend for any one!
0345511468|5.0|Just as good as the first two books.  Delightfully insightful, a wonderful coffee-table type book.  IT'S STAR WARS!  JUST BUY IT ALREADY!
B00CCR9P0U|5.0|This spiralizer is amazing!  I was going to buy the Spirooli (I think that's what it's called), but I kept putting it off for some reason.  Then I saw a YouTube video stating that SPIRALFIX was the best one that the guy had seen.  I liked how small it looked.  I thought it was a bit smaller, but it's actually a really good size.  I've only used it on the 3mm setting to make zucchini pasta, but the switching of the sizing is genius and easy.  And I love that there is no core.  It probably makes the \\"pasta\\" a bit watery, but it's better than not knowing what to do with a core.  The little disk that is left in the end, I just threw into the sauce before blending in the Vitamix (which I had recieved only days earlier).  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.  It would probably be really good for traveling as well if you're into having spiralized veggies often.  I don't know why, but the price was raised about $10 since I purchased it.  Hopefully it will go back down...
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Just perfect! Great movie, The absolute best special features - if your buying this movie, you need the bluray just for those special features!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I've been playing this game for about 2 years, and when I first got this it is a good opportunity to play this again restarting. It's fun. Period............
0756655307|5.0|This book is easy to follow, information as an Encyclopedia ought to be & has a good mix of artwork through out the text. If there was ever anything marvel you needed to know, it's in here!
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Everything is good, and I hate going outside to look out. This also saves me a lot of television time!!!! I love it!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Science Fiction as it should be...OK maybe not totally believable, but very credible.  Well written. Superb story telling. Great character development. Thought provoking. Gritty and engaging. Such a well written story that I'd recommend to non sci fi readers too.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It is little difficult to navigate at times, for example, the communication and profile can appear complex at first. Otherwise it is fantastic. (=
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Interesting story, fine writing, bit slow in the middle, picks up and is not a bad book in the end.
B00AWBNNAG|5.0|I think this is the best because any set I want I can now customize and make without buying the set! THANKS SO MUCH!!!!!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|It was an exciting and interesting book with a surprising end. I would read more books from this author without hesitation.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I LOVE this game! I play it almost everyday, only stopping because my Kindle dies. I really like the newest update, where you earn magic to get new dragons. If you don't have it, you should get it.
B005721Y7Y|4.0|All the hype that surrounded this film was pretty spot on.  I think this film paints a very thick canvas of the complexities of life juxtaposed with the simplicities.  I will definitely agree that some of the screenplay felt full of itself, but the film should be looked at in its full context.  Chris Cooper played an excellent role with Kevin Spacey proving why he is such a sought after commodity.<br /><br />High Point - \\"I Rule\\" .<br />Low Point - As stated, some of the artsy scenes.
0385121679|5.0|Very interesting book and great story line. Stephen King never fails to impress, scare and creep us out! I love it!
B000ICXQOM|4.0|How can you not like this film?  If you came across this movie, you probably already know who Bruce Campbell is and watch had seen something from his catalog.  If you do not know who he is.....KNOW!  This is a true guys film.  Tons of great quotes, tons of bad special effects (some good as well), and plenty of suave machismo.  It would be best to watch the two prequels before viewing, but I don't think it is required.  Evil Dead and Evil Dead II are great as well.  It is a great watch on Saturday morning when you are eating your cereal with your feet up.<br /><br />High Point - \\"This is my BoomStick!\\"<br />Low Point - Some of the climax could have been edited out.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I would love it but for one problem.  It interferes with other electronics.  In this case it interferes with television cable reception and playback of my DVR.  Clearly this device was not tested by the FCC or truly tested by Google.
B000NMW6J8|4.0|I have probably watched this film 50 times.  The tension in this film is very well done.  I have not seen too many films that tackle the \\"what is a terrorist\\" question.  I enjoyed the acting, but some scenes are a little overdone.  Casting was pretty well done, with the exception of a few bit parts.  If you enjoyed films like Spy Game, you may enjoy this one as well.<br /><br />High Point - The Ending.<br />Low Point - Some of the interactions with the FBI are slow.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I like  this book because o  the suspense...throughout the whole book your reading it wondering what will happen next and it is definitely NOT a predictable book...
B006LSZECO|4.0|A good fiction writer knows the best motivation for a reader to keep turning the page is the last sentence cliffhanger.  In Gone Girl, Gillian Flynn comes through in spades.  The pacing of the book is well crafted.  Because the chapters go back and forth between Nick and Amy, you finish one chapter on the edge of your seat, then read the next one just to get to the one after that.  After reading a few hundred pages, you are still consumed with the \\"what happens next\\" feeling.  Although the story was quite twisted, the character development was well organized and insightful.  I enjoyed the read and , based on the storytelling talents of Gillian Flynn, I'll be picking up another one of her books very soon.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys adult themes and dark overtones.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|I am a fan of the series and each season highlights something different about someone different.  It's not just about Dean and Sam.  I like the new characters introduced, and enjoy the story lines.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|I remember reading the casting announcements for this film and was quite perplexed.  The only new cast member I was looking forward to was Aaron Eckhart.  But a year later, as I was walking out of the theaters, I was more than blown away.  This film is Christopher Nolan's masterpiece.  Clocking in at over two and half hours, I can only remember one scene I didn't enjoy.  The layers and subtext to each of the characters, settings, and plot lines were amazing.  When I think of great movies, this one is near the top.
B004XXIHS2|4.0|A tightly-knit suspense story. It's been over 50 years since this book was published and it stands up well.  It shows just how timeless the genre is.
B00008LDPU|3.0|Some good, Some bad.  The overall make up of the stories are disassociated from each other, with the underlying Matrix storyline to hold them together.  I do think you need to have seen The Matrix prior to viewing this film, as some of the plots depend on your basic understanding of the subject matter.  I can safely say that some of the animation was top notch.  I enjoyed about half of the stories.  The back-story for the rise of the machines was by far the best story.<br /><br />High Point - The Second Renaissance.<br />Low Point - World Record.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved it. It was thrilling and had many twist to the story. After every chapter y o u just want to keep reading to find out what's gonna happen next. What you think is going to happen doesn't once you keep reading.
B009LRE040|3.0|This movie was a good lesson learned for expectations.  Following the near perfect Dark Knight, I cannot remember a movie I was more looking forward to seeing.  However, when the credits ran, I found myself disappointed at the simplicity of the plot.  It was fairly straight forward, which normally would be enough to hold its own, but it just could not live up to the previous Batman installment.  The character development was lacking, even with a lot of the main characters.  \\"Catwoman\\" was meant to be mysterious, but in the end, was a throw away figure in the overarching storyline.  Within the first 30 minutes I was disappointed at the introduction of one of the main characters because it gave away the entire \\"shock\\" ending (if you know basic Batman lore, you understand my plight).  In the end, it was an OK film, with direction lacking in some key areas.
B009ERK35W|5.0|While watching the movie you notice blatant inconsistencies.  At the end of the movie you finally learn what is going on in the background.  Then you watch the movie again and the inconsistencies fit.  I have watched no other movie that did more to encourage me to think about what I saw on the screen.
6305311463|2.0|Loud noises; big explosions; huge special effects...Check, Check, and CHECK.  This film was made for the cable show \\"Movies for Guys Who Like Movies\\".  I can take a lot of liberties with reality when watching a science fiction movie, but this was a bit much (and this from someone who can buy off on the Transformers movie).  Michael Bay recently came out and spoke honestly (ie negatively) about the movie, which is a saying a lot.  After about half an hour, the film becomes a grouping of short, one liners, that are woven together to make a storyline that is too advantageous.  I am still waiting for the the day the Aerosmith song doesn't haunt my dreams.<br /><br />High Point - Steve Buscemi's psych test.<br />Low Point - How many times can things really go wrong; really?

B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Even though this book is technically a sequel, there is more than enough depth in storytelling to make it a great stand alone piece of fiction. I had read a pre-release review of Doctor Sleep in Esquire Magazine which discussed the how the story wasn't just scary, but 'tender'. Needless to say I was intrigued. After reading the first couple chapters, I realized the true horror of the Torrance family wasn't the ghouls and ghosts, but the internal demons that drive us. Mr. King provides the reader with a well balanced approach of internal and external protagonists. The storyline is well balanced, as are most King novels, and left me shocked on numerous occasions. Definitely a good night stand read.<br /><br />Although not necessary, I would recommend reading The Shining prior to Doctor Sleep to get a fuller context of the underlying character motivations.
B000025171|5.0|This album wasn't nearly as daring or adventerous as OMD's first couple of albums, or even gems such as \\"Dazzle Ships\\" and \\"Architecture and Morality\\", and yet it's hard to find any fault with it. Yes, OMD was veering in a more pop direction at this point, but it's not like they ever aspired to be Tangerine Dream or Can. The songs here have plenty of hooks, and those endearing vocals, but there are enough sharp edges to please fans of the early albums too. All in all, another thrilling mini-masterpiece, highlighted by some of their very best songs. It's an album that has held up well over the years.
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|Even though this book is written for early teen readers, the writing of Lois Lowry paints a deep and thought provoking picture.  The basic structure of this book is solid and well crafted.  Upon this foundation, Lois Lowry takes the reader into a world where we gain a true perspective of what it means to be alive, the true meaning of mortality, and the consequences of the choices we make.  I liken the themes to Kierkegaard's The Sickness Unto Death.  We only know the extent of our joy by the measure of our despairs.<br /><br />I recommend this book for readers of Ray Bradbury fiction and students of main stream philosophy.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|Brad Pitt in a zombie movie?  Really?  He's definitely slumming these days.  I guess with all the kids he has to feed, he needs some way to pay the bills.  Pretty bad.
B00439MV42|3.0|I am unsure if it is required by law to have the third film in a series be western, but I can understand why the story shot back to cowboys.  I find it odd that the trilogy keeps the same story fresh with each installment while following a very similar formula.  It's refreshing to watch a movie that can grab your interest from the start and keeps hold till the credits.  I would not consider myself to be a fan of western movies, and I still wouldn't.  Even thought 95% of the film takes place in the Old West, I would still consider it a science fiction film with a western setting.<br /><br />High Point - DANCE!<br />Low Point - The introduction of Clara is a bit long.
B006PZBR8S|4.0|This was much a better movie than I thought I would be.  You've got Hugh Jackman and robots so my expectations were that it would be a futuristic type action movie when in fact, it was a deeper story.  Clean up some of the language and it could be a movie that young kids would enjoy.
B001BANK32|5.0|Full disclosure: I am part of the large group that had seen, and thoroughly enjoyed, Stanley Kubricks interpretation prior to reading the source material. With that said, I will never be able to watch Kubricks interpretation without utter disappointment. Stephen Kings window into the Torrance family is wildly enveloping. The character development is well layered and provides a complicated set of internal dynamics. Mr. King provides a enough drive to keep you turning the page, but also allows enough breathing room to pick up where you left off. For the full effect, I would recommend reading a few chapter (or the whole book for that matter) right before bedtime, with all the lights off.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for anyone who enjoys a good scare.
B005MMY9A8|1.0|I feel asleep (snoozed) twice in the first 30  minutes.  It was slow, boring, and never got me interested in watching any more.  Essentially, a dud.

1401232590|4.0|Didn't quite know what to expect when I cracked open my copy of Jeph Loeb's 'The Long Halloween'. I had been told by many friends that it was a great read... and I was pleasantly surprised. This story follows a young Batman partnering up with a young Gordon and Harvey Dent to investigate a slew of murders being committed against the Falcone and Maroni Mob families by a mysterious killer know only as Holiday for his propensity to kill people on holidays. With some panels making clear nods to the movie 'The Godfather', the art could have been inked by Francis Ford Coppola and the dialogue written by Mario Puzzo. If you want a Batman book with a great Mob story and appearances by other classic Batman villains, don't pass this one up!
0307887448|5.0|Best book i've read in a long time.  Couldn't put it down.  Anyone who grew up in the 80's or late 70's will love all the nostalgia in the book.
B00E8S2GJI|4.0|Story: 3 stars  Quality: 4 stars  3D: 5 stars  Special Features: 4 stars<br /><br />I know we all want to look at this movie separate from LOTRs, but we can't. We want to buy the extended because the extra footage from LOTRs made LOTRs a better movie. This extended version of The Hobbit does not make it a better movie. It doesn't make it a bad movie. It's pretty much the same with 30 extra minutes. I did not feel the story was expanded in a better way and I did not feel the characters were explained in more detail. The pacing felt a little slower because of the extra 30 minutes. There is a lot more singing in this version, I will say that. It has two more musical numbers in it which makes that four songs in total. If you didn't read the book then the songs will mean nothing, but fans of the book will love more of the songs. It began to feel like a musical though.<br />If you are on the fence about whether or not to buy the extended or the theatrical it all depends on if you don't mind watching 30 minutes more of this movie.<br />If you already own the theatrical version I would recommend renting the extended first and seeing how you like it. I will recommend if you have a 3D TV or plan to get one in the future then get this version. The 3D is amazing. I actually like the 3D on the blu-ray more than I did in the theater.<br /><br />I had the other Blu-ray version of this movie which included the production diaries. This version does not include those. They do include many great documentaries on the production of the movie, but I miss having the production diaries. There are about 9 hours of documentaries. I had trouble getting back to the main menu of the features. Once I selected Play All I could not go back to the beginning from the remote. I had to start the disc over again.

B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|This is one of the best albums of 2013 and Gaga has released. People keep complaining about all the different genres, but that is the point. GAGA IS NOT STICKING TO ONE GENRE. SHE WANTS TO AND DID EXPERIMENT. Art is about expansion. One should not be limited to one sound and type of lyrics. This is fun, it's exciting, the album is meant to be danced to and have fun to. It's not serious on the outside. Diehard fans and people who actually take the time to look into the album and follow Gaga's moves will know what ARTPOP is and how it is conveyed. The ART is part of what Gaga wears and does during this era. ARTRAVE was a prime example and so is the new ARTPOP app! Have fun. Buy it. And enjoy! PAWS UP!!!<br /><br />Must Buy: Gypsy, G.U.Y., Dope, Do What U Want, and Mary Jane Holland

B00EW9GQR6|5.0|In the words of Tony Bennett, this lady is \\"America's Picasso.\\"<br /><br />Lady Gaga's fourth studio album, ARTPOP, is nothing short of excellence. It isn't quite like The Fame, The Fame Monster, or Born This Way and that's what so impressive and admirable about Gaga - she is constantly changing and evolving musically and artistically. Both lyrically and sonically, the album is fun, catchy, upbeat, but also very intelligent with what it's saying. Though on the surface it doesn't seem nearly as deep and philosophical as Born This Way, it's certainly still filled with meaning and does not lack Gaga's unique metaphors and references to Greek mythology, literature, and works of art (both Renaissance as well as contemporary).<br /><br />ARTPOP is easily the best album of 2013. But...is it better than Born This Way, Gaga's previous record-breaking album? Hmm, that honestly depends on who you ask. Commercially, I believe the general public (people who AREN'T hardcore Gaga fans) and music critics will probably prefer ARTPOP over Born This Way due to its seemingly carefree and fun nature, as Born This Way received a lot of criticism back in 2011 for being \\"too mature\\" because people could not grasp why a pop album had to be so profound and weren't too happy with Gaga touching on the issues of gay rights, illegal immigration, freedom of religion, gender equality, government corruption, etc. on Born This Way. People who weren't too thrilled with that will without doubt enjoy ARTPOP more. However, it was precisely due to those very reasons why Born This Way why such a pop masterpiece and will be hard for Gaga to surpass artistically. If you're looking for a Born This Way 2.0 you will be disappointed because, comparatively, ARTPOP is far more sexual and provocative in the lyrics and less preachy and melancholic. In either case, it's too early to tell if ARTPOP will be better received than Born This Way. But one thing's for sure: it certainly will not disappoint.<br /><br />Now, because one obviously buys an album for its songs, I'm going to a review each song individually below. Here is a track by track review of the album. As with all of her albums, Lady Gaga wrote every single song herself.<br /><br />Quick review of the songs:<br /><br />1. Aura - artistic rebirth and evolution, the opening lyrics states \\"I killed my former\\" which implies the Lady Gaga we came to know from the Born This Way era is dead. The Gaga you will hear on this album is a different Gaga. Also has some feminist lyrics and mention of a metaphorical burqa, a metaphor for Gaga's costumes and stage presence. Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the burqa? = Do you wanna see the person underneath all the wigs and make-up?<br /><br />2. Venus - artistic rebirth and evolution, a continuation (conceptually-speaking) of the first song. Here, new Gaga is being introduced to us (Birth of Venus).<br /><br />3. G.U.Y. - gender roles and feminism. Gaga implies that women are the dominant ones during sex precisely because they choose to bottom.<br /><br />4. Sexxx Dreams - sexual oppression, the encounter mentioned in the song can only take place in a dream because in the real world it would be frowned upon. References to the novel 1984 by George Orwell.<br /><br />5. Jewels N' Drugs - drug use from a possibly satirical take. Shows Gaga's musically diversity. She did a lot of jazz and rock n roll during Born This Way, and is exploring rap and hip hop here in ARTPOP.<br /><br />6. MANiCURE - love and relationships, the girl in the song seemingly wants to be \\"manicured\\" but really wants to be \\"man-cured\\" (cured from falling in love with men).<br /><br />7. Do What U Want - fame and celebrity culture, Gaga and R. Kelly tell the haters and the critics that they don't deserve an artist's heart and mind so they might as well do whatever they want with the artist's body.<br /><br />8. ARTPOP - art sings to pop in the first verse of the song (\\"come to me, with all your glamour andcruelty\\" - addressing the sexualization of female pop stars) and pop sings to art in the second verse (\\"come to me, with all your subtext and fantasy [...] in a perverse hue\\" - addressing the general public's misunderstanding and lack of appreciation for contemporary art. Thematically, the reverse of Andy Warhol's pop art movement. Genius track.<br /><br />9. Swine - rape and sexual trauma being coped with via a seemingly innocent and upbeat EDM song (don't let the fun beat overpower the dark, dark lyrics! take a look at what she's saying in the song!)<br /><br />10. Donatella - arguably talks about a shallow and vane love for the fashion industry, loving fashion because it makes you feel fabulous. Also seems to talk about men's fear of a strong, confident women.<br /><br />11. Fashion! - undeniably talks about a pure and good-intentioned love for the fashion industry, loving fashion for the beauty and art of it.<br /><br />12. Mary Jane Holland - a positive take on drug use.<br /><br />13. Dope - a negative take of drug use, essentially the complete opposite of the previous song.<br /><br />14. Gypsy - the difficulties of finding love when traveling the world.<br /><br />15. Applause - an ode to theatre and the art of performing. Also a thank you to fanbases.<br /><br />More detailed review and analysis for those interested:<br /><br />1. Aura<br /><br />Lady Gaga stated multiple times in interviews that the order of the songs on ARTPOP mattered, as they're intended to be listened in a certain order for the sake of continuity and abstract storytelling. This certainly proves true as the opening line of Aura, the very first track on the CD, states \\"I killed my former and left her in the truck on Highway 10 / Put the knife under the hood, if you find it send it straight to Hollywood.\\" That opening line is very important for understanding what the song is about and actually what the album as a whole is going to be about. Gaga is letting us know that she \\"killed her former\\" - meaning that she's left behind the Gaga we heard on Born This Way and that the Gaga on ARTPOP is going to be a different Gaga. Lyrically, the rest of the song talks about wanting to meet the mysterious girl who lives behind a metaphorical burqa. The chorus goes, \\"Do you wanna see me naked, lover? Do you wanna peek underneath the covers? Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura?\\" While intentionally provocative, there's more to those lyrics than just their sexual implications. Gaga is asking you, the listener, if you want to see the real her - the woman behind the mask and theatrical costumes. The woman behind that aura of unapproachability and mystique that seems to fascinate so many. She's essentially asking you if you want to see the human being behind the Lady Gaga character, and that's an awesome way to start off the album. Additionally, the bridge introduces us to the various themes and topics that will be explored on the album (\\"Dance, sex, art, pop, tech\\") so it's really no surprise why Gaga placed this song as the album opener. Sonically, the song starts off acoustically with vocals reminiscent to those in \\"Judas\\" and a killer guitar, then gets very electronic and techno. It's probably one of my favorite tracks on the whole CD. Very, very catchy. My favorite lyric is, \\"Enigma popstar is fun, she wears burqa for fashion. It's not a statement as much as just a move of passion.\\"<br /><br />2. Venus<br /><br />Prior to the album's release, Lady Gaga made numerous public appearance dressed as Venus, the Greek goddess of love, as depicted by Botticelli in his famous painting \\"Birth of Venus.\\" Because in the previous track, Aura, we learned that Gaga killed her former, we now understand that she is about to be reborn as Venus during this song (literally, it's the birth of Venus). It's interesting to note how much Gaga has played with the concept of rebirth throughout her albums, as it was a theme she explored in both The Fame Monster and Born ThisWay as well. Lyrically, the song talk about taking a journey through space on a rocket and both the Greek goddess Venus as well as the planet Venus are mentioned. Metaphorically, it becomes quite obvious as the song progresses that Gaga is asking us to take a journey with her through the album, as the \\"outer space\\" talked about in the song seems to be alluding the album itself and the \\"planets\\" mentioned at the end is most likely a metaphor for the rest of the songs on the CD. But again, even ignoring this, the song is a fun pop song nonetheless. Sonically, it's a very fun song to dance to that seems to borrow an 80's dance-pop sound that you might hear a gay night club, and the chorus is INCREDIBLY CATCHY. Another favorite of mine.<br /><br />3. G.U.Y. (Girl Under You)<br /><br />G.U.Y. is, without question, one of the more provocative songs on the album! G.U.Y. starts off where Venus left off (conceptually speaking) and begins with a spoken introduction by Himeros, god of sexual desire, who proceeds to tell us that the song will serve as a how-to guide on new sexual positions in the  bedroom. The technical diction and seriousness of the intro makes the song comical right from the start, and the addictive chorus (probably the catchiest chorus in the whole album, but that's just my opinion) makes the song a memorable one and arguably the best one on the whole album. The song is lyrically very feminist as Gaga sings about how women are in fact the dominant ones in bed precisely because they usually act as the submissive partner. In other words, the \\"bottom.\\" Gaga tells the man in the song that if it wasn't for the G.U.Y. (the Girl Under You), the man who is topping wouldn't have anyone to please or anyone to please him. Undeniably a very interesting point to raise about sex! My favorite line comes from the end of the song, \\"Touch me, touch me, don't be shy, I'm in charge like a G.U.Y. I'll lay down, face up this time, under you like a G.U.Y. I wanna be that G.U.Y.! The girl under you, guy!\\"<br /><br />4. Sexxx Dreams<br /><br />After the how-to guide provided by the lyrics in G.U.Y., we get Sexxx Dreams! Lyrically, the song is about the sexual encounters Gaga has with a woman (or possibly man) in her dreams every night. However, the song becomes a little more complex and hard to understand when you realize that Gaga is in fact singing to three different lovers in this song - the lover who she sees in her sex dreams, her current boyfriend, and her ex-boyfriend. Additionally, what's so interesting about this track is that it makes some very obvious references to the novel 1984 by George Orwell (it actually isn't the only track on the CD to reference a classic novel) and satirically compares sexual thoughts to a \\"crime.\\" As the lyrics say, \\"we're both convicted criminals of thought\\" and \\"we can't hide the evidence in our heads\\". Gaga and her dream lover will have to attend \\"the trial of this doubtful law.\\" This particular choice of words (crime, criminals, evidence, trial) further reassures this interpretation. Although many will dismiss it as just another pop song about sex, it's really quite an interesting commentary on how we perceive and even demonize sexual exploration of the human body. However, even without this analysis, the song is really great and hooks you in right away with some very hard beats and seductive vocals. Also, fair warning, the track alludes to masturbation, in case that kind of stuff bothers you. But then again, what were you expecting from a song with this title?<br /><br />5. Jewels N' Drugs (featuring T.I., Too $hort, and Twista)<br /><br />Wow! It's Gaga rapping, y'all! Not much to say about this one. I personally am not a huge fan of hip hop, but I can appreciate good rap song when I hear it. Plus, it appears that most of the general public who's listened to the album is really fond of this song. We get rap verses from T.I., Too $hort, Twista and even Gaga herself, as well as an obligatory pop versefrom Gaga. Lyrically, the meaning of the song can be summed up by its chorus, \\"Don't want your jewels, don't want your drugs, don't want your money, just want your love.\\" Not a favorite per se, but still very good. Gaga shows musically diversity and versatility here, as well as in other songs on the album, by breaking free from her usual genre and trying out something new. My favorite line, \\"I admit that my habit's expensive and you may find it quite offensive, but I won't die at the hands of another. I'm your mother, sister, your father, brother.\\"<br /><br />6. MANiCURE<br /><br />Rock n roll Gaga is back on this track! This is one of my favorite songs on the album because, not only is the chorus incredibly catchy and danceable, but Gaga's vocal delivery is just astounding here. Her voice is very powerful on this track immediately from its abrupt hits-you-in-the-face beginning, and the instruments are very rock -- this is not a pop song!! Lyrically, the song makes use a clever pun: the woman mentioned in the song wants to be get a manicure (she wants to be \\"manicured\\") but really, what Gaga is saying is that she wants to be cured from liking men (she wants to be \\"man-cured\\"). Or, at least, cured from falling in love with guys so easily. It may not be the best play on words, but it is a smart one and the way you perceive the song definitely changes once you notice the double meaning. Overall, even if you don't spot the pun, it's still an awesome track to dance to and you can just go on thinking it's really just a song about getting a manicure.<br /><br />7. Do What U Want With My Body (featuring R. Kelly)<br /><br />Gaga and R. Kelly give the haters and critics a huge middle finger with this R&B song. Despite the suggestive title, the song is actually not sexual in content once you understand the context of the statement repeated over and over in the chorus. Lyrically, this track is pretty freakin' genius. Gaga is telling the harsh and cruel critics (probably the ones who criticized her weight gain in mid 2012) that they cannot have her heart or her mind, but that they can do whatever they want to her body. She's essentially saying that as a performer, her body belongs to the public to some extent. She is a product - a brand name you see in stores - and you can \\"purchase her\\" when you buy one of her albums or go to one of her concerts. So, do what you want to her body [the vessel for her performances] because you are entitled to it and its potentially corporal vanity (the idea that female pop singers show off too much skin), its physicality, and its mortality. However, you are not allowed to touch or even close to Gaga's heart [her feelings and emotions that give her love songs meaning] or her mind [the place of origin for her creativity] because those things only belong to her and her alone, and they (the critics) do not deserve it and have not earned access to it. Honestly, that's a really great thing to write a song about. R. Kelly's softer voice surprisingly goes really well with Gaga's harder vocals and together, the duo makes this song one of the best ones on the album. I assume Gaga chose R. Kelly over other artists for this collaboration due to his scandal from a few years ago and his relation to the media. That clearly goes hand in hand with the meaning and message of the song. \\"You can't have my heart and you won't use my mind, so do what you want with my body! You won't stop my voice cause you don't own my life, so do what you want with my body!\\"<br /><br />8. ARTPOP<br /><br />The placement of this song is really crucial. There is a reason why this song isn't at the beginning or at the end of the album, but instead is located right in the middle. The song serves as a reminder that Gaga's art \\"could mean anything,\\" as the lyric states. That's basically saying to keep in mind that these songs have more than one layer of meaning to them and in order to enjoy the \\"ART\\" part of ARTPOP, you have to be aware of the multiple lyrical interpretations of the various songs. Otherwise, you just get the \\"POP\\" part of ARTPOP, which is pop music and nothing more. If you want the full package, pop music with artistic value to it, you have to start reading in between the lines. You have to realize that the song Aura does not talk about a literal burqa, but rather a metaphorical one. You have to realize that Do What U Want isn't really about doing whatever you want to Gaga's body, but instead is actually a very intelligent rant to the critics. THAT is what this song is about. Now, musically, this track is very hypnotic and mesmerizing and should absolutely be listened to with quality headphones in order to appreciate all of its beauty. The \\"laid back\\" and \\"chill\\" feel of the instrumental alone is enough to make this one of the best tracks on the CD. It kind of gives me an oldies vibe. Also, in case you don't realize this, she isn't singing to a person in this song. She is LITERALLY singing to the art and the music. My favorite line is one that really encapsulates the very essence of Gaga as an artist: \\"A hybrid can withstand these things, my heart can beat with bricks and strings, my ARTPOP could mean anything.\\" (The hybrid can refer to the Gaga-motorcycle from Born This Way - that idea that fantasy and reality can exist together, though it probably refers to art and pop united as one entity).<br /><br />9. Swine<br /><br />Swine is the perfect example of why the song \\"ARTPOP\\" is right in the middle of the tracklist. You have to remember that these songs have more than one meaning. On the surface, Swine simply seems to be about a disgusting man who is hitting on Gaga at a night club. But upon a deeper look at the lyrics, this song could very well be (and most likely is) about rape and/or other forms of sexual abuse. There is a contrast between the undoubtedly depressing lyrics that demonstrate hurt and pain (\\"I know, I know, I know, I know you want me. You're just a pig inside a human body. Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting!\\") with the crazy electronic beats and rhythm that purposely overshadows the meaning and even may not make allow you to notice the power of the verses and chorus. This is, by far, the most EDM track on the whole CD. It's as if Gaga is trying to cope with the trauma by making this song happy and upbeat. There is also a reference to Lord of the Flies at the end of the song (\\"paint your face and paint his face and catch the beat\\"), which makes sense since a pig head is a major plot point in that book and this song is, after all, titled Swine. If you think about how this song would sound acoustically as opposed to the electronic dance monster that it is, you will REALLY understand the meaning behind it.<br /><br />10. Donatella<br /><br />All sugar coating aside, this song is straight up about being rich, blonde, and bitchy. It's one of the most fun and poppy songs on the album and the shout out to the actual Donatella is amazing, although this song seems to be more of a satirical take on Gaga herself. A parody of Gaga from The Fame era. The song is undeniably shallow but, to me, it seems as if it's poking fun at what people assume strong and independent out-spoken women are like and the lyrics therefore should not be taken literally but still seriously.<br /><br />11. Fashion!<br /><br />The song is practically the opposite of Donatella, which is why it comes right after it. Song order matters! Gaga talk about fashion from an artistic perspective, as opposed to the way she talks about it in Donatella which is basically \\"I'm fabulous in my expensive clothing, look at me.\\" The vocals are slower and softer and the song is supposed to sound more beautiful and less of a club banger. The chorus gets stuck on your head easily, too. Be warned! Addictive chorus! Though I wouldn't necessarily call this a highlight of the album, it is definitely one of its hidden gems that grows on you the more and more you listen to it. I reallyenjoy Gaga's voice here.<br /><br />12. Mary Jane Holland<br /><br />Just like how Donatella and Fashion! are essentially grouped together and compliment each other, this song (Mary Jane Holland) and the next song on the album (Dope) are also grouped together and also serve as polar opposites of each other. Musically and sonically, Mary Jane Holland is probably one of the best songs on the CD. The beats are sick and make you just want to dance nonstop to this song. Lyrically, yes, the song is about marijuana. But it's more than just that. Though yes, at first glance the lyrics seem to imply that smoking weed recreationally can be fun, some of the other lyrics also seem to suggest that smoking pot is equivalent to making a deal with the Devil, thus illustrating the dangers of temptations. This song is the yin to the yang of Dope and has to be listened with Dope to get the full picture of what Gaga is trying to say. And by the way, my favorite line is, \\"I don't mean to boast but our troubles are the most mad-magical in Amsterdam. So if you have fear Apollo, sit on my lyre and play it like a piano man!\\" No, this song is not four minutes and twenty seconds long.<br /><br />13. Dope<br /><br />Dope is a very slow piano ballad with beautifully sad lyrics. This song contrasts Mary Jane Holland greatly and basically explores to dark side of cannabis consumption. Gaga is singing the depressing lyrics to her lover, telling him that she will find a cure for her drug addiction because she needs him more than the drug. Dope pretty much throws out the window any pro-drug message that Mary Jane Holland may have potentially conbeyed. It is the \\"low\\" to the \\"high\\" of MJH and the lyrics truly are moving and beautiful. Gaga really shows off her powerful vocals here as well as her songwriting talents (show this track to anyone who dares to say that Gaga cannot sing!) My favorite line is, \\"My heart might break without you, might not awake without you. Been hurting low from living high for so long. I'm sorry that I love you, sing with me Bell Bottom Blues. I'll keep on searching for an answer cause I need you more than dope.\\" The piano on this track is also really wonderful. This is, hands down, one of the most emotional tracks on the CD and you can real FEEL that raw emotion in her voice.<br /><br />14. Gypsy<br /><br />Gypsy is another one of the slower songs on the album, though nowhere near as slow as Dope. Once again, this song shows off Gaga's vocals and songwriting skills moreso than the other songs on the album. Gypsy probably has the best lyrics of any track on the whole CD and the energetic beat can be compared to that of The Edge Of Glory from Born This Way. Lyrically, the song is about two lovers who can't be together because one travels the world. I don't like to say that songs are flawless because that's just my opinion and therefore subjective, but let's be real, this song really is flawless! This is one of the best songs Lady Gaga has written in her entire professional career. I dare say this it is my absolute favorite song in all of ARTPOP. I love the imagery Gaga evokes about chasing the sunset and driving away in your car and also, I love the line, \\"And then he asked me, he said, 'Baby, why do we love each other?' I said, 'Honey it's simple, it's the way that you love and treat your mother.'\\" I'll admit that that line made me get a little teary and smile like a dork. Another great line: \\"So I just packed my baggage and, said good bye to family and friends, and took the road to nowhere on my own... Like Dorothy on the yellow brick, hope my ruby shoes get us there quick, cause I left everyone I love at home...\\" Gypsy is a very memorable track.<br /><br />15. Applause<br /><br />What a great way to end the CD...with a big round of applause! This song reminds us that Gaga does not live for the fame and the money, but rather for the applause of her fans. If you really pay attention to the lyrics, the song is pretty much a huge thank you to the fans as well as an ode to the theatre and the art of performing. The David Bowie-esque vocals in the verses and the catchy chorus makes this track one of the highlights of the album, even if we had  already heard it before. My favorite thing about this song (other than the shout out to Jeff Koons in the second verse) is that Gaga reminds us that she is an ARTIST, not a celebrity, and that her work always has meaning. It isn't just fun bubblegum pop music to dance to. \\"Pop culture was in art, now art's in pop culture in me.\\" I actually did a more extensive review of this song when it came out, you can read it here:[[ASIN:B00EJYGQFG Applause]]<br /><br />So, why did I take my time to analyze each and every one of the songs? Because that's the whole point about Lady Gaga. It's pop music with meaning. It always has been that way with her. The lyrics are intelligent and well written and if you don't appreciate that, then you're missing 80% of what makes Gaga so different from the rest of her female contemporaries. She spent 2+ years making this record, so you can bet it's not just a bunch of random pop songs with simplistic lyrics thrown together. Sure, people will claim that it is. People will say it's style over substance, that it's pretentious, that its just like her past work and nothing new, and that I'm reading too much into it because some people can't fathom that pop music can be deep too (and also because hating on Lady Gaga has become a rather popular think to do). These are probably the people who don't WANT to look at the art behind the work and then complain that there is no art, and who most likely prefer the mainstream pop of this generation that has unfortunately given pop music a bad name in the last couple of years. Despite the length of my review and the analysis I present, I can bet this going to receive a lot of thumbs down by those very people.<br /><br />But let's not forget that this woman hasn't been praised by The Rolling Stones, KISS, Paul McCartney, Sting, Tony Bennett, Bruce Springsteen, Cyndi Lauper, Blondie, and Brian May (from Queen) for nothing. They know about good music and they like Gaga. If that doesn't validate Gaga as an artist, then I don't know what does. And given that the title of this record is ARTPOP, you can bet that the artistic references found in these songs are very much on purpose and should therefore be noted and not taken for granted. It's not just me over-analyzing pop music; the title of the work is literally ARTPOP for crying out loud!<br /><br />Lady Gaga is already making history with this album, and that is no exaggeration. The marble sculpture of Gaga shown on the cover of the album was done by none other than the legendary Jeff Koons, who also famously sculpted Michael Jackson and Bubbles back in 1988. Additionally, at the album release party Gaga threw in New York on the day that ARTPOP came out, she debuted the world's first ever flying dress (yes, it ACTUALLY flies!) that she had TechHaus - a branch of Haus Of Gaga - specifically build for her for ARTPOP performances and her upcoming world tour. She's also performing a track from ARTPOP in space in 2015, and will be the first artist ever to sing in outer space.<br /><br />In conclusion, you can bet that this album is going to get hate - in fact, count on it - but ARTPOP is an amazing pop album with amazing beats and lyrical content. Some will like it because it's a great party album you might hear in a club. Others will like it for the metaphorical lyrics, metaphors, and art references. All in all, Gaga does not disappoint and this album will go down in pop music history.<br /><br />Also, Gaga has developed a free app for smart phones where bonus tracks will be released, the first of them being a song called TEA.<br /><br />Favorite songs: Gypsy, Aura, Dope, Venus, G.U.Y., Swine, ARTPOP, Applause, Mary Jane Holland, Sexxx Dreams, MANiCURE, Do What U Want.<br /><br />Lyrics: A+ (Gaga's poet shines through hersongwriting)<br /><br />Production: A+ (Zedd, Madeon, and DJWS did an amazing job)<br /><br />Cover: good representation of the themes explored throughout the body of work. POP is on the front of ART while still merging with it. Renaissance art (Botticelli's Birth of Venus), contemporary art (Jeff Koons' Gazing Ball), Baroque art (Bernini's Apollo and Daphne), performance art (Lady Gaga) are all present on the cover.<br /><br />Booklet: photo shoot of Gaga posing for Jeff Koons for the cover.<br /><br />Warnings: explicit lyrics, adult themes, nudity in the booklet<br /><br />If you enjoy ARTPOP, I recommend giving Gaga's past albums a listen (especially Born This Way) as well as her upcoming jazz album with Mr. Tony Bennett, due in stores on New Year's Day.le lyrical interpretations of the various songs.

Swine<br /><br />Swine is the perfect example of why the song \\"ARTPOP\\" is right in the middle of the tracklist. You have to remember that these songs have more than one meaning.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is such a great game!  It is very addictive! I haven't had any issues since downloading it a month ago.
B00D8HNR2K|3.0|Decent, but not NINs best album ever. The album didn't come across nearly as hard as some of the earlier works. It still has the NIN sound to it, it just doesn't seem to have the adrenaline that I was hoping for.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|works great, but needs a way to display laptop desktop on TV. The audio and video quality is very good.
B00BLYFDO2|4.0|Very rock and roll. If you need a lot of synthesizer and auto-tune in your music, this one isn't for you. Its just good old fashioned rock.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|The kind of game you'll always want to play &quot;just one more&quot;. Very fun and addictive. The ultimate time waster.
B00BQXWH2O|3.0|Sort of un-intense. The tracks were ok, but overall, it was kind of lame. This is probably my least favorite AVB album.
B0039Q7QKE|5.0|I wore the pin on my Halloween costume and it looked awesome. Loads of people complimented me on it so I'd recommend this to anyone.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I just feel so disappointed. It`s not that I haven`t read a book where a main character dies but it usually advances the story in a way only death could. There was no reason to end this story this way. It left a sad bitter feeling behind and who wants to feel that after investing in a otherwise great story?
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Fantastic quality, really easy to use interface and outstanding installation process. really happy about the quality/price relation. You won't regret
1423113497|5.0|This is good product but at the time of purchase I only got books 1-3 I would have much preferred that I got all five in this series, this product was timely delivered and was true to image shown online. Great gift good price
B003O86FMW|5.0|Second time reading this book and it is as good as the first time. Can't wait to see the movies and see how they translate it from book form...
B0058DRUV6|3.0|Fascinating at times but a very boring read. I had to read this for my job in order to have a discussion on moving our company from a good business to a great one. As a history book on business practices and the successful leader that ran them and theories on how they became great companies, this book is a must read. Does give you good insight to the workings of what makes a great leader.
B0048EANPQ|5.0|My mom loved this movie and my mom did the same thing only it was not with sports. . .
B004UID2LC|4.0|I needed to copy down a video from youtube to use in a presentation and this worked perfectly. It was relatively easy to use by just copy and paste the URL into a command line and then it copied down to my hard drive.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Beautiful graphics, great storyline. Something is always going on. I recommend this game to anyone at any age. Thank you Gameloft for another masterpiece.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I've enjoyed the game, but it has it's problems.  I do make occasional in-app purchases, but suddenly it won't let me.  Also, I keep getting pop ups about missions and updates, but there never show.  Gameloft needs to get the kinks out and release some new updates.
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|But...there's a few but here and there but it's fun. I have a headset so I hear zom zoms everywhere xD
0812550706|5.0|Such a wonderful book, full of future tech, intrigue and excitement. Its futuristic sci-fi that is still relatable to our modern world.
B007C7UZIG|4.0|Cool,great to chat with friends that are online. And to check out the deals,easy to use. A great app to use.
B005HSL626|2.0|I love to pay fruit ninja and the idea for this game in very ingenious, it's worth the extra cost to avoid the annoying advertisements this version has made as a main part of the program. I downloaded it and played it once before deleting it and buying the ad free version.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Hi giving<br /><br /> high-tech. Frozen in time Rome hit wonder feeS act a&e she dug cut she an airb a&e she cut access she she grew
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|You're da man! Every nite I had a diet coke in my GRIMACE glass and read Dr. Sleep...twice I had to power off the kindle, that scared!  Thanks and will recommend to everyone.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I loved reading this comic. It was well made although the t.v. show is very different from the comic. For example, Daryl is not a character at all in the comic which is quite disappointing, and a character named Donna and her twins not in the t.v. show. I bought the comic the first day I bought my Kindle, and I finished it the same day. It is kind of short for the 8 or 9 dollars, but it was still really good. I plan on buying the others as well, but since they are a bit more expensive, I have to span out the time I buy each one, lol. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to see a different side to The Walking Dead series; It's as if the author said, \\"What if this happened, instead?\\" from the comic book to t.v. show. Very good!!
B007PT1PEY|5.0|I love the way Sir A C Doyle portrays the villains and heroes and the way all the bits fall together in an elementary manner.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Great game I love the graphics the only this is get rid of the energy let them just free fight other then that I love it
B003B02O7I|4.0|The fist half is better than the second.  The second drags a little but it's still a great book to read.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Of course it's addictive. It's fun and the graphics are pretty good. I have had a couple issues where it does not respond to the direction I give and the runner just does what he wants. But other than that I enjoy it and so does my daughter, who is the one that introduced me to the game. :)
B00CSYRHG6|4.0|Based on a serial graphic comic from the 1980s, \\"From Up on Poppy Hill\\" is a sweet and gentle Japanese anime drama set in 1963, right on the eve of that nation's hosting of the Tokyo Olympics.<br /><br />Voiced by Sarah Bolger in the English version, Umi is a high school girl whose mother is studying in America and whose father has apparently died in the Korean War. She currently lives in a boarding house run by her grandmother where she cooks the meals for the residents and her two younger sisters. Umi also raises flags everyday in the hope that her father, whose body has never been found, will find his way to her. Umi has also fallen for a cute boy, the publisher of the school newspaper, and, through him, she becomes instrumental in helping to save a clubhouse the philosophy geeks use for their meetings and which has been threatened with demolition by the higher-ups who are more interested in modernizing war-ravaged Japan than in holding onto relics of the past.<br /><br />Directed by Goro Miyazaki, \\"Poppy Hill\\" is an old-fashioned, no-fuss movie that deliberately avoids the CGI effects and hectic style of most modern animated movies. The use of cell-drawn animation yields an uncluttered palette that nicely matches the storyline. The characters' movements are fairly stiff and the facial expressions virtually nonexistent, but the background has a lovely watercolor appearance that captures the visual simplicity of an earlier era.<br /><br />The screenplay by  Hayao Miyazaki and Keiko Niwa lacks focus at times, but that actually adds to the movie's charm since we don't feel as if we're watching an overly contrived narrative designed to make points. As such, it's a movie that youngsters in particular will find reflective of their own concerns and lives, regardless of nationality.

B009LMTDL0|5.0|Amazing book for both men and women to read. It clear that there is a definite struggle of being a woman, a working woman and finding your strong voice without coming across as an aggressive controlling workaholic. I believe this book gives you guidance and offers concrete statistics and mentions other books for you to read in the future.
B00F031XPS|2.0|The content is fine, someone should have played it before shipping them out. Audio and video are not in sync, delays especially during interviews.  I thought it was me until someone else on a forum experienced the same thing. So, return it now and get one from the same batch or wait??
B008JFUS28|5.0|\\"Thor: Dark World\\" is another addition to the on-going series of Marvel superhero movies that have displayed an uncanny knack for longevity and success. There seems to be no end to the public's desire for individual superhero movies as well as gathering them all together for \\"Avengers\\" movies. \\"Avengers: The Age of Ultron\\" is slated to release in 2015. This has been cause for some criticism as some of the individual movies are more tie-in than stand alone films.<br /><br />I'm the first to admit that many of these Marvel movies appear to me to be more money-making ventures than exercises in good film-making. Sure, all movies are money-making ventures, but some of these films were hampered by lazy scripts and events that are just there to string you along to the next movie or to sit through long stretches of movie with sparse action, watching talking heads or even montages of events.<br /><br />\\"Thor\\" was the movie I was least excited about, having been an Iron Man fan growing up, but it was \\"Thor\\" that I actually ended up enjoying the most out of all the films. It wasn't lazy film-making, it had a good script, they didn't sell the viewer short with a superhero incapacitated or give you an hour of film where the only action is a superhero shooting fruit while drunk. Most importantly, they had a story to tell that engrossed the entire film.<br /><br />\\"Thor: The Dark World\\", for lack of better words, makes all of the other Marvel films, with the exception of \\"Avengers\\", look like they were made by amateurs with good equipment. Just as I was growing tired of superhero films (and I'm a huge fan), \\"Thor: The Dark World\\" shattered all of that. It is quite simply the most complete action/adventure film I have seen in years. Not only did the movie have a good story to tell, it was loaded with charm and skillful creativity from top to bottom.<br /><br />You want films to take you there and not remind you that you went somewhere until its over and \\"Thor: The Dark World\\" did that on all levels. I haven't sat through a film with such joy and involvement and forgotten my critical eye since I was a teenager. It was an effects and visual marvel and never once did I think they were trying to cheap out the viewer with a lazy script. \\"Thor: The Dark World\\" let it all hang out and in the process, they may have created one of the most complete and entertaining films in decades. It was funny, frightening, exciting, intelligent, intriguing and a movie not to be missed, even if you aren't a follower of the Marvel series.hat on all levels.

B00DVKOYBM|5.0|&quot;8 Ball Pool&quot; is one of the best pool games out there for mobile or even computer. Graphics are some of the best I've seen for any game - ever!

B00EW9GQR6|2.0|I'm guessing this review will be voted down by rabid fans.<br /><br />What's left to say about Lady GaGa that hasn't already been said about her? It's trendy to hate on this woman, and I should know. But is she deserving of all the controversy? Not anymore, no. After exploding on the scene with a bombshell of an album, The Fame, and then its supplement The Fame Monster, it seemed that Lady GaGa could do absolutely no wrong. But then Born This Way happened. And it polarized every listener of pop music between \\"I hate this woman\\" and \\"I love this woman.\\" I fell into the first category. Madonna comparisons aside, the album was a mess of electronic beats that literally hurt to listen to. There were some nice production tricks here and there, but the monotonity and pretense surrounding the project overshadowed any of its positive aspects. It was a misguided attempt at ego inflation that ended up offending, well, just about everyone. Except the people she meant to offend (the Catholic church, I think). After about a year of bad press and critical scrutiny, despite a successful display of singles, Lady GaGa just dropped off the face of the Earth as best she could. She had surgery, reportedly concerning her hip, cancelled a portion of her Born This Way Ball Tour, and began work on her next incarnation. As much as I dislike Lady GaGa, I do try to give her the benefit of the doubt and give her the chance to redeem herself. Maybe she'll pull out another unpretentious song like Just Dance or Starstruck. My problem with Lady GaGa is that she began to sing about things she really knew nothing about. She's a socialite-brat-art-school-drama-kid who liked to party and dress in funny costumes. If nothing else, at least The Fame was believable and honest.<br /><br />And it seems that Lady GaGa has partially returned back to what made the world fall in love with her. ARTPOP, her forth abum (in my opinion The Fame Monster is its own separate entity), is a collection of odd pop songs that on the surface is just a party record. But there's a lot more here. It's far less artistic than perhaps she wants us to believe, but at least it's more genuine than Born This Way was. The biggest issue with ARTPOP is that just about every song is hookless, forgettable and remarkably unimaginative. Her hype has certainly taken center stage, her fashion sense second priority, and her music is somewhere on the middle the list just above wiping her butt. ARTPOP has rapidly devolved GaGa back into the party girl we all knew she was, but it kept all of the same pretense of Born This Way. And this is evidenced best on the album's opener, the woefully embarrassing Aura, which already caused quite the splash for its misappropriation of Islamic culture. Not really surprised. It seems nothing is all that sacred when it comes to whatever will keep Lady GaGa's names in the paper.<br /><br />But is it all bad? No. Not really. There are some delicious beats here, far better than those on her previous record, and the production is slicker. Also, GaGa's voice has drastically improved. She's sounds far moe operatic than she did on The Fame or Born This Way, and I find her a lot easier to listen to. The problem with ARTPOP really is that the material is weak and bland, something I wouldn't necessarily expect from her. This album is mostly stuff I might expect from Britney Spears, Ke$ha, or Katy Perry. Say what you want about Lady GaGa, and trust me I have said everything already, at least stuff like Bad Romance is distinctly GaGa and could be sung by nobody but her. ARTPOP just lacks the personality that made the woman memorable. Stuff like Fashion! and Sexx Dreams are not bad tracks. I wouldn't be annoyed if I heard them while shopping in a store or if they came on the radio; but I can't believe they even made the cut for what has been lauded as GaGa's return to form. They sound like watered down Fame songs.<br /><br />The leading single, Applause, was the first sign that GaGa might serioulsy be on the decline. Of course this album will not be unsuccessful-- only unsuccesful when compared to her previous efforts-- but it is a sign of things to come. The general public seems  disinterested at this point as she is now longer polarizing people but rather she's just boring them to tears. Songs like the worthless and unnecessarily maudlin Dope are not really going to have people running to jump back on the GaGa wagon. I guess I just don't get it. Maybe I'm not cool enough, but I just can't understand why all of a sudden GaGa has gone from making waves to just barely catching them. Gypsy has a lovely melody, some of her best lyrics (until it culminates in that awful ending bridge), and is one of her better attempts at balladry, but the production sounds like something Ne-Yo and Pitbull might come up with. It just feels odd. GaGa might be slipping a little bit. I feel like she's lost her way. There's something in the music of ARTPOP that feels humbled over Born This Way, but all the hype surrounding kind of pollutes the idea that she's gotten over herself.<br /><br />At the end of the day, Applause is probably the most GaGa song on this record, and if you didn't like that song, you likely won't like the rest of this album too much either. That said, it is worthy to say that Mary Jane Holland might the overall album standout. Despite being a trashy ode to what Lady GaGa calls a marijuana \\"addiction\\" (get real, GaGa), it has just enough pop smarts to worm its way into your head the same way Just Dance did.<br /><br />Listen to: Gypsy, Mary Jane Holland

Get a colonoscopy.<br />I had high hopes for this film, but sorry, it's one of the most badly scripted, premise wrecking, simply boring films I've ever seen. Don't waste your money.

My wife and I have seen the movie tons of times and honestly we didn't think that the video quality on Blu-ray was that greatly improved over DVD, so I wish I would have saved our money.

B007EC27QM|5.0|I  never was any good at math so I ALWAYS need a calculator and this little ditty is a winner. The face of the calculator spans the whole front of the 'fire' and has everything on it that a regular calculator has. How clever can one be. This is great when you're not at home; maybe the grocery store or adding up your millions and determining how little you have left in the bank once all the bills are paid.<br />I am in awe of this app, it's cheap and worth five times (and more) the price.<br />I love it, love it, love it! I adore all my apps but this one is the coolest of the bunch!!!!!!

B00BY1F8UQ|5.0|Not more to say about it. Three masters of their trade at work inspired and passionately as well as technically brilliant. Would you expect anything different?!
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|It's a game that limits you to energy which you have to Waite for but it's fun. Which it had a regular version without energy. I see the farther in the game the more energy that will be needed.
193700788X|3.0|I have to say that I'm glad this series was put to an end.  I did like how the ending was set up...far better than the show!  If you've read the entire series you have to read this so you have closure!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Good game so far.  Just started so haven't come across the cash aspect of the game yet but I am sure it is on the way
0762445262|3.0|It was a good add on to a gift, but you pretty much have to have it directly on again the wall to really get the effect of it.  My nephew is only 3 so he still thought it was pretty cool.
1476734941|4.0|Great diet. If you choose this as a lifestyle, it can work for you.<br />Dropped 6 inches off my waist with absolutely no extra exercise. I had an injury and could not do any weight lifting. I sit at a desk most of the time at work. No other diet has worked like this for me.<br />Diet 2 to 3 days a week, eat sensibly the rest of the time, the weight comes off.<br />I am on the maintenance part now, because I just purchased new clothes. So I will stay at this weight for awhile, then drop the last 2 inches around my waist when the new clothes wear out.
B005LF9OCE|5.0|What a great and funny show. A must watch for anyone on any occasion! Characters are well developed, a very well written show!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|There aren't a lot of words to describe this book. This book is pretty much indescribable, because it is so brilliant and so heart breaking, but I guess one word that could do this book half a justice is amazing. All aspects- the reality- the honesty- the pain; it was all just: amazing.

B000N2HCM4|1.0|Obama has demonstrated his disdain for truth with his disgusting lies about ObamaCare.<br />His promises of transparency in his administration, clear communication on all topics, and his many lies about ObamaCare make this man incapable of telling us the truth.<br />A much better book/DVD is Dreams of My Real Father which I find much more believable.<br />We know little or nothing about this pol.<br />In the years in which he has been president we don't know anything about his undergraduate time (as a foreign student) or his years in law school. We have not been told why he and Michelle surrendered their licenses to practice law.<br />It was amazing that so many Americans ( living and dead) voted for the worst ( and perhaps the last) president of our republic.<br />Obama feels that everything should be done by the government and is leading us directly to Socialism.
B00B2H28SM|5.0|I first heard about these sisters when I was watching 90210 and they were singing the song<br />&#34;Now I'm All Messed Up &#34; and I was hooked.

B00G4CXHSK|5.0|Ok, this game surprised me. At first, it seemed very easy, with over priced costumes/weapons. But past the first chapter we r, it got quite interesting. There are more than path to take, different weapons are best for different, and none of the low purchase price weapons are over-powered.<br /><br />I'm about half way through right now, and I am entertained. The flamethrower holds some interest, even though it has a short range and just feels off from my normal AK and grenade launcher ( in the game! I don't own them).<br /><br />So,<br />Pros:<br />Good controls<br />Wide variety of weapons/costumes<br />Addictive<br />Rewarding when addicted (lots of coins!)<br /><br />Cons:<br />Crashes frequently, but if you click the wait option, it'll start up again<br />OP final weapons (looking @ you rail gun)<br />Slow moving platforms<br /><br />Final notes:<br />The costumes do have a purpose among them, each having a different amount of agility, damage given, and hit points. Do not bother buying funds, if you play the game for a week, you'll probably have around 8K coins, which I believe is close to the final weapons. Lastly, there are a large variety of enemies some flying, many shoot, and some give a ton of coins.<br /><br />Thanks for reading, and say yes to this comment! :D
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Fellow readers, we've been denied, cheated, we get nothing!  Allegiant made me wish I'd never read (and enjoyed) the first two books in this series.  **SPOILER ALERT**  After waiting and waiting (and waiting) for Tris and Tobias to FINALLY break free, get a chance to build a life together (or at least make love just once), Tris is killed off???  I felt like I'd been punched in the gut, bawled like a baby!  Even worse, I felt totally cheated.  I was SO looking forward to the film adaptation(s) and now I don't want to see the movie(s) at all.  I wasn't hoping for or remotely expecting a tidy, Happily Ever After for T&T - not in the turbulent world they live(d) in - but ANY AFTER would have been great.  I hope you've enjoyed spending the money I've paid for your books to date, Ms. Roth, because you'll not get one more red cent from me.
B008EKOIN8|2.0|I can't recommend this book. Novice cooks will not learn enough and experienced cooks don't need the spiritual treacle that you have to sift through to get to the insights; from a culinary content perspective this book has enough material to fill 30 pages. I say this with regret. I have been a fan of Pollen's writing, I own several of his books,  but 'Cooked' left me lukewarm.  I am a culinary professional by training and to be fair I found insights that were worthwhile to me. As with his other books, the depth of his research is extraordinary. His bibliography is almost worth the price of the book. However, this book really annoyed me. This is an egotistical book and what is worse it is thoroughly condescending in tone. This is a man who does not lead a life 95% of us face every day.<br /><br />Want to learn about real barbeque, take a month or two, travel to the Carolinas and spend one-on-one time with a pit master. Want to learn how to bake, take several weeks off and work with the best artisanal bakers in the country. The same for braising, just call up your neighborhood professional chef, who must be highly rated, and get one on one training every Sunday for who knows how many weeks. Isn't this what we all can do? Just call up the country's best practitioners and get them to work with us one on one. Is Pollan kidding us?<br /><br />I also took issue with his comparisons.  He tries to convince us how making bread isn't really that time consuming but what he fails to discuss at all is the time spent cleaning up. Anyone who bakes will know how messy that process is, even for experienced bakers. He makes another comparison talking about the time involved to eat a slow cooked meal versus each family member individually making their frozen dinners and trying to eat them together. That was a ridiculous exercise.<br /><br />In his section about bread making he talks about the evils of white flour and vilifies commercial bakers. He bemoans the fact that we purchase whole wheat Wonder Bread at Safeway for $4.59 but won't pay $5.00 for an artisan loaf made by Chad Robertson. I find comments like that insulting. I wish he would stop his celebrity worship, it is demeaning. I'm reminded of an interview Leslie Stahl had with the founder of Chez Panisse, totally non-objective, totally star struck.<br /><br />His section on braising is equally frustrating.  The gist of the chapter is braising works best when you cook low and slow, which by the way is the same secret to good barbecue. He correctly tells us about the importance of cooking the base aromatics slowly to get the sweetness out of the onions and whatever other vegetables you choose to include. However, that's not enough. He has to extol the miraculous virtues of eating as a family, the joy of sharing a meal from a common pot. Really, we need him to tell us that? He gets almost mystical about it. I wanted to scream, shut up. His implicit moral superiority made me ill. I could go on but his writing totally ruined my reading experience.
B00CNQ7CRI|4.0|In Mad about a Boy we find Bridget Jones in her early 50's (though she'd never admit that) and with a young boyfriend named Roxter.  She has two kids a boy around 7 or 8 and a 4 or 5 year old daughter. (age wasn't made very clear)  Our favorite quiet Lothario lawyer Mark Darcy is sadly no longer with us.  It has been five years and endless prodding from her friends to bring Bridget out of her shell and back into the dating pool.<br />Would it be a Bridget Jones novel without it being a bit of a mess along the way? Of course not!  Some gems include<br />·  Her recent obsession with Twitter and how many followers she has<br /><br />·  Working with an obesity clinic to lose that baby/ emotional eating weight<br /><br />·  Trying to make friends with her eccentric neighbor who is also a single mom<br /><br />·  Getting a movie script she wrote optioned by a production company<br /><br />I enjoyed the book.  It was panned pretty heavily on Amazon, but not for the right reasons in my opinion. Many felt that there should have been more emotional growth on the part of Bridget from single lady to single mom.  Bridget Jones is a silly, but lovable mess.  She always has been and she always will be and that's why I love her!
B005PK5C12|5.0|I expected this series to be catchy in the beginning, and then to let me down. I was happy to be wrong. Consistently fun and interesting (for a horror series, that is-- certainly not 'funny ha ha'), with great cast, great writing, and the perfect score--not to mention the ambiance. I also loved the ending, which is rare for me. I hope the other seasons will keep up.

B00064WSN2|5.0|I really loved this band back in the 60s when this album was released. At the time, I didn't own it, but my brother did and I heard it a few times. While it does seem to ape the band's first album in the style of the songs on side one, it really does stand on its own two feet once you listen a few times. Pictures of a City, Cat Food, Cadence and Cascade; these are very enjoyable songs in completely different styles. The various iterations of Peace on the album are all good, too. The only piece I didn't like is the long riff on Holst's Mars called The Devils Triangle. It's noisy, disturbing and somewhat monotonous. I usually skip that track, but the rest is first rate stuff.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|No words can describe how I feel about this book now. Sure as hell not the ending I suspected by an amazing one nonetheless. I was in endless tears throughout the ending of the book. Aiden \\"IS\\" perfect but Seth..... *sigh* he will always be my #1. I will love that boy until the end of time. Amazing end to an amazing series. Read it.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War is exactly that. The narrator has conducted several interviews to piece together what happened before, during, and after the zombie apocalypse for the international community. However they have left out many facts. So the narrator has decided to use the cast off interviews to tell the complete story. Keep this in mind as you progress through the book, it is a gathering of interviews from around the world, from the perspective of the people who lived it. Several of the characters reappear through out the book, and it can be fun to put their stories together to see the complete picture.<br /><br />Overall the book is well put together, and a fun read. If you enjoy stories about the zombie apocalypse, and in a different format than your typical novel, then I recommend this book.

1476729085|5.0|I loved this story for so many reasons. It's different, not your typical love story. The plot (no need to go into detail here as other reviewers have already done that, but basically it's this - scientists decides he needs a wife and goes about it in a very methodical scientific way by designing the \\"foolproof\\" survey, but events of course don't at all go according to his plan) is brilliant. The writing style is perfect for the story, and the dialogs are witty. But mostly it's the characters that shine in The Rosie Project. Don Tillman, the main character, is absolutely lovable, even though in real life most of us know people like that and often have a hard time not finding them annoying rather than lovable. Even though I would classify this book as light reading (I devoured it in a couple of days), it is thought provoking. It gives you a glimpse into the mind of someone who is obsessive-compulsive and somewhere on the Asperger spectrum (I'm sure a professional will cringe at my wording), having trouble connecting emotionally and structuring his day in a way that most people would find weird, to say the least. And yet by being let into his thought process, we begin to wonder if it's not him who has a better grip on life, and us \\"normal\\" people who are unduly complicated and screwed up. Who is to say what is \\"normal\\" anyway?<br /><br />This book will make you laugh out loud and warm your heart at the same time. It celebrates people's uniqueness and tolerance for each other, entirely without being preachy but wildly entertaining instead.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The Chromecast proves to be a solid device for streaming content. It is easy to setup and stops you from messing around with the hard to control UI of your Smart TV. It also seems that streaming content from Google Services is more reliable. The browser mirroring function is still in beta but anything else just works fine. A good device, even if some of the advertised features (apps) do not work in Europe.

1476727651|5.0|Stephen King is a genious!  This is another book of his that is so amazing to read. I just love the fact that he can write a book of fiction, that even my fiction-hating-husband can read and rave about. Unbelievable!
B00881VLCE|4.0|Love the puzzles, however, there are too many interruptions with ads for other games, and even clicking off of the puzzle, where I have to reenter site and refind the puzzle I was working on.
B00DYOOGYK|3.0|Okay. First things first. See that trailer? Oh, look at THOSE GRAPHICS. So beautiful, right? Right. Not even close to the in-game graphics. The graphics in-game are so...outdated and undercooked, should I say. I see no improvement over Gangstar Rio's texture quality. Second: this game is very broken in gameplay. I don't receive a vibrant Las Vegas at all, I get instead a dead, dull city. One or two cars on screen at any given time, a couple pedestrians, and that's it. Yeah, the missions are easy as pie, a given example: your first street race. Here I am, a scrub, given a muscle car, and we race around some underpass 8 circuit. Racing against 3 others in sports cars, who basically drag around near the start. I can get miles ahead of them, even crash, and they never even catch up. All the while, I've got E-Man, screaming at me to go faster, even though I could ride a turtle and be faster than the others. Not to mention, for an illegal street race, we were going crazy slow. Rant over. Game rating: 3. Good time killer, too easy, but overall bland and unpolished.
B002TXZRRM|5.0|The author captures the pride that is in every Africans heart when we think of this beautiful continent.  It's the first book I've read of this series and it's addictive, I will be reading them all! I may be an Italian by birth, but I was born in Africa, I've lived in Africa my whole life and I'm honored and very lucky to be a part of this very special continent.  Thank you Alexander McCall Smith for writing such simple and enjoyable books and giving people a glimpse into the heart of Africa.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I LOVE this show!!! I can't wait for the new season! Im going through withdrawals! I hope this show never ends~
B00A6RCSKC|3.0|I would give this five stars but it has a thing where you have to buy some of the heros and I would like to have the heros
006202406X|5.0|I see a lot of folks have given this a bad review, but I have to disagree, I loved it. I don't get why other folks wer disappointed, because I couldn't put it down. The book moved along fast paced, and I felt that all my lingering questions from the first two books had been answered by the end of this one. It wasn't what I expected, but that's ok, if the author gave us exactly what we were expecting would she really be doing the readers a service. I won't give anything away, but there were definitely a lot of things I wasn't expecting. I like how she wrapped it all up. I think with the plot twists and the ending she chose she took a definite risk alienating some of her fans but I think it was a risk well played. The Divergent series has become one of my favorite dystopian series.
B000002BVN|4.0|I like the songs I didn't already have: Blood on the Dance Floor, Morphine, Superfly Sister, Ghosts, and Is It Scary; but I never care for remixes.  I always prefer the original songs.  I consider it a good buy to get the new songs.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|After trying the free version of this game, I just downloaded the full version and this game does not disappoint!  This is a fun association game for children just learning their letters and shapes. The unique interface makes it fun for kids to learn while having fun \\"building\\" letters and putting puzzles together with very effective shape association techniques being used. Trust me on this, your kids will learn the entire alphabet very easily using the full version. Each letter game has activities that help the child learn basic words that begin with the letter and also includes various objects that start with the letter to help reinforce the sound of the letter and help ingrain new words into memory. This is definitely worth the couple of bucks to get your child six months ahead of the curve as far as letter and word association goes. My preschooler loves building the animals out of shapes because they always do a cool animation after they are put together! This is a well thought out learning game for the little ones!

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Think very carefully before you buy. It works like advertised, but after a couple weeks of use, not very impressed. I suggest people wait to see how things pan out for this device, before buying. Though the price is hard to beat, I think that $35 could go to buying something that offers more. If the Roku offered YouTube, I'd get that instead. I have a Roku, but in another rm. Got Chromecast for bedroom. No dedicated remote and no continuous streaming takes a little getting used to. But that just could be me.This is good for those who are deep into the Google lifestyle. Music on Google services works well. Pandora works good. YouTube looks great, but devices limitations may be it's failure in the future. I'm getting that Logitech review failure vibe. I use Samsung GN2, and GN10.1, which work great for casting media. I have fios, and router is on same floor, so responsiveness is quick. I really don't regret buying this thing as it is for bedroom and I do get my $35 worth. Hopefully there will be future add-on of more services, that don't hinder the hardware's performance to the point where its useless.
B002XURC24|5.0|Amazing book!  Really opened my eyes. If you like The Secret, you'll love this book too.  I practice many of the tidbits everyday..

0380789035|2.0|I finished the book this evening and it was the hardest book ever to finish i have ever come across. It wasn't all bad! The introspective nature of the book was very well done. The characters were vibrant and very well drawn. However the story was very nearly insignificant and nothing remotely exciting ever happened. I almost quit at least 5 times but doggedly kept going. The best way I know how to describe this book is like this; Do you remember the last time you had a fever and when sleeping you kept have those weird fever induced dreams! Well that's how this book felt to me! Well it looks like the fever is going away and I can now move on to something different and, most importantly, more to my liking!

B00BWQW73E|5.0|This is a great read with a lot of information that I did not know.  As a devoted Amazon customer, it makes me think twice about my devotion.  While Amazon is great to their customers like me (so far), they seem to lack ethics in dealing with suppliers, just like Walmart.  The tactics that Amazon employs now that it is dominant in many categories are borderline illegal or unethical.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Finally! ... a book I didn't want to put down.  It takes a really well written book to hold my interest and yearn for it not to end, and it doesn't happen frequently.  Congratulations, Hugh Howey.  Looks like you may have succeeded in doing just that with &#34;Wool&#34;.  Looking forward, with much anticipation, to reading &#34;Dust&#34;.

006202406X|1.0|Very disappointed in this book. The story was boring, the plot was weak, and the ending was the icing on the cake. I wish I hadn't read this book. It kind of ruined the trilogy for me and I loved Divergent.
B008B68IUY|4.0|New like it says and packaged well. Quick delivery.  Not sure about the product itself because it will be for my lil girls bday or Christmas.
B009IH0ICG|4.0|Works very well. This one is tougher than most. The other two I purchased from Lowes work but have rusted. This one's still shiny. Lights up great without needing lighter fluid. Saves you chemically-tasting burgers/steaks!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|It works great an  its a must have because th  random access ram really gets abused by programs.  I can tell when it is cause the kindle slows down.  I like the auto kill feature. also warns you during use that ram is being used up when its 80 percent used up.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|Excited they have a new cd and I play the cd in my car all the time. Good deal as we'll  the only negative is that there is a free t-shirt offer and they took out the process fee out but yet to charge me the shipping and they still haven't shipped it out.

B00G4I0DNG|1.0|I will start by saying that I am a veterinarian who has witnessed Seaworlds dedication to assist with wildlife rehabilitationin both in Orlando FL and San Antonio TX.  I do not, nor have I ever, worked for or been paid by Seaworld.  Seaworld spends hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in wildlife rehabilitation releasing the rescued animals back to the wild if at all possible.  Their efforts have directly led to development of more effective treatments for exotic diseases that have literally saved thousands of animals.  The level of care provided by Seaworld employees is exemplary all the wile being paid by Seaworld to rescue these animals.  The vast majority of these animals are not on display, they are not used in shows and the are not exploited in any way.  They are simply rescued, their lives saved and released back into the wild.  I have no direct knowledge of the Orca training program as I have not worked with the Orca's however this documentary is simply PR for special interests and is in no way an objective look into Seaworld.  I will continue to support Seaworld as I can as I know they are often the only organization with the facilities and knowledge to rescue these animals.  The makers of this film should be ashamed at their lack of objective film making.  This is not a documentary it is a witch hunt.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series and sadly watch it alone.  This was my least fav. seasonal ending of all time.  If someone did not cry at the losses suffered, they do not have a heart! (tongue in cheek)  I look forward to the coming season with hopes of characters that will win my heart yet again and NOT DIE!!!!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|We really need to update Facebook, but Amazon doesn't offer an update. When clicking on update on Facebook it takes you to Google play market. Is there possible a way around this? My Facebook now at really odd times, says Facebook has stopped. If I'm in the middle of a book and it pops up Facebook has stopped. Or while playing another game. Something has to be done about this Amazon!
0142421715|2.0|I'm relieved to finally close this sequel's cover. CROSSED was a drawn-out description of going from one place to another, grouping this book more in the action-adventure category, than with MATCHED in urban dystopian fiction. Flashbacks and POV switches were used to fill the pages. The text of CROSSED would have served the storyline and Ally Condie's readers better shortened to a few chapters inside another novel in this series.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />* Characters wander back-and-forth in a vast landscape for almost the entire book, even retracing their steps<br />* One overt goal overshadows nebulous subplots<br />* The reader is left without answers to important questions unnecessarily<br />* Revelations are not supported by any foreshadowing in either novel<br />* The \\"will she/won't she\\" hand is played too much<br />* Limiting character pool and physical setting throughout most of the novel were unfortunate choices<br />* Little additional info is learned about the Society's culture<br />* Markedly little personal growth<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />* Alternating narrators moves the plot forward and makes the characters more real<br />* Properly-applied flashbacks provide thought-provoking backstory and hints at what's to come in the third novel<br />* Excellent descriptions of physical setting<br /><br />In MATCHED, I became intrigued by Ally Condie's imagining of the flawed utopia. Much of her prose were reprints of YA clich&eacute;s and the overused love triangle trope. But I was invested in Cassia, Ky, and Xander; I had to complete the trilogy. I wish my \\"what if\\" complex would go away, because I truly don't want to move any further in this series.<br /><br />The 1st in this series was:<br />[[ASIN:014241977X Matched]]<br /><br />The 3rd in the series is:<br />[[ASIN:0142425990 Reached (Matched)]]
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The beginning of this book was extremely slow. I almost stopped reading it but I'm glad I didn't. The ending was better than expected.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Glad to have this game on my kindle!! Thank you Amazon!! No problems at all with it!! It works great and does not shut down on me-like it does on my droid!
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|I liked the fact that he stepped out of his comfort zone and played a dislikable character. I guess he did that in Training Day too (I'm counting the character in Man on Fire as a good guy with a few flaws). The fact is I enjoy almost every movie he has ever made. And this one was no exception!! I'm sure I'll watch it several more times, so I would certainly say that it is worth at least 2 hours of your life to watch it once.
B00881VLCE|1.0|Be careful about spending too much money on this App with the new iPad software. Even with the &#34;fixes&#34; and restarting the iPad, it crashes constantly. It is a fun app, but suddenly started crashing a lot. And, heaven forbid you get an ad for &#34;Go to Meeting&#34; ... It will interrupt your game 12-15 times in a row, within seconds of each interruption. Very disappointing. I understand a periodic advertisement, but this has ruined the app for me. I used it for about a month before all of this started... So the free puzzles were enjoyable... Until I started buying puzzle packs.  How ironic!!!
B009LDD4V4|5.0|I really like the series because of the action and the humor.  The casts makes you feel like  they truly are all friends.  It's so much better than any of the reality shows where every one is yelling and fighting.  I have been a fan since it started and I will continue. for as long as it keeps up the good work.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Ready for the next book!!  Martin is so consistent with his characters, plotlines and all; it is a pleasure to read!
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Months and months later I've finally had time to digest the closing chapter of a series that, for me, was 18 years in the making. I can't imagine what people went through who started when book one was first released.<br /><br />Over-all pretty happy with Sanderson's style. He keeps the tone and characters of the previous books, only taking me about 10 pages to get used to the subtle differences in writing style.<br /><br />I can't blame Sanderson for how the books ended, I have my major disgruntlements with certain characters dying and some living through hell and back. I can't blame Sanderson for reminding us that the whole saga took place over two years....wtf?<br /><br />What I can blame Sanderson for is making the weirdest decision to change Matt's speaking style by introducing the new phrase...&#34;Here now&#34; into his lexicon. Why oh why on earth did you do this? Why did you make Matt sound like a 60 year old man, going against everything I've known and loved this character to be? This one thing almost ruined the novel for me because every time I began to forget about it, he'd throw in another &#34;here now&#34; and get me steaming mad all over again. I wish Sanderson would go back and edit the book and remove them all, because at this point, he single handedly ruined Matt for me as you can tell because 6 months later I'm still mad about it.<br /><br />At this point, if you haven't read it and you know what I'm talking about, you obviously have to read, just to finish this damn monolith of a series. It's fast reading and outside of Matt, you won't be disappointed that you did so.

B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Her best album yet. I love every song on the whole album, she just keeps getting better and better. I highly recommend this album.
B00ECL7ZJ2|5.0|I discovered this band on one of those rare occasions when MTV actually played a video. \\"Don't Save Me\\" demonstrated brash swagger against a driving backbeat, and the video emphasized the Haim sisters' playful chutzpah. (YouTube  it; you'll thank me.) I'm pleased to say, the entire album maintains that lead single's momentum. For a staunch anti-modernist like me, it's strange to say, but this band makes me happy to be alive right now.<br /><br />The Haim sisters utilize elements I recognize from the synthpop that dominated radio during my grade school days. Hints of The Human League, Til Tuesday, and The Thompson Twins permeate their sound. But Haim isn't interested in mere imitation; they cherry-pick what suits their artistic vision and discard the rest. Importantly, their instruments, not the digital effects, dominate their sound. They're a musicians' band, not a studio phenomenon.<br /><br />Tracks like \\"The Wire\\" and \\"Honey & I\\" symbolize their dominant themes, particularly a woman's desire to captain her own romantic life. Not for them the girlish pleadings of Top-40 acts like Britney (though they don't flinch from broken-heart confessionals like \\"If I Could Change Your Mind\\"). Haim makes music for grown-ups, with real adult aspirations for mature control in meaningful relationships. No wonder mothers and daughters embrace them with equal fervor.<br /><br />In a music industry dominated by shrinking violets or chintzy Katy Perry-ish temptresses, the Haim sisters really impress me with their mature, thoughtful, yet playfully danceable music. Their sound reflects their breezy Los Angeles roots, the same milieu that birthed the Eagles' later albums. But they'll also feel familiar to those of us weaned on the Second British Invasion. The sober adult themes and sonically complex arrangements create music I just enjoy hearing.

0767919408|5.0|This book is outstanding - I have read many of Bill Bryson's books and have loved nearly every one of them.  I never thought I would be that interested in a short time period that I, as a 41 year old, just don't identify with.  How wrong I was.  His slightly sarcastic sense of humor brings a good dose of common sense and he weaves in plenty of background information so you can understand how all the events of the summer of 1927 come together in a rather extraordinary period of time.  He talks about crimes and events that I never thought I would be remotely interested in.  He discusses people in a way that broadens your perception of who you thought they were, such as Herbert Hoover.  My knowledge of Hoover was limited to his presidency and the surrounding crash/Great Depression.  Bryson gives you far better background than any history book or history teacher ever does.  READ THIS BOOK.  Aside from being informative and rather enlightening, it is also truly an entertaining read.
1476734941|5.0|After watching Dr Mosley's TV program last summer on KET I became excited about the possibilities of me staying healthy,living longer, and losing some weight.  My age and physical health status was as follows: age 75, weight-slightly into the obese BMI class and daily cholesteral medication.  Some changes were absolutely in order for me before something like diabetes, cancer, or alzheimer takes over.  First, I ordered his book for my Kindle.  The 5-2 IF(intermittent fasting) is easy-it is almost fun. Then I ordered three more hard copies and gave them to special friends.<br />Today's progress: 33 # below my previous top weight and 5&#34; of belly fat gone resulting in a 15% load reduction for my feet and legs to carry around.  My next decision, do I buy a new clohes now or do I wait to see if a smaller size 34 trousers will be requierd?  Yes, you might say I am EXCITED.<br />Thank you Dr Mosley,<br />Ken
B003JTHWJQ|2.0|I read the hard copy of this book having been given it as a gift.<br />Mr Dawkins presumes from the beginning that God does not exist. He, without any tangible evidence that God is a delusion, seeks to discredit the Creator. It a great fiction book. It's well written. But Dawkins leaves a lot to be desired from an intellectual point of view.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book is well written in a straight forward, non-scientific manner allowing anyone to understand as clearly as possible what Dr Alexander experienced. I felt my faith renewed and refreshed after finishing this book. Today's world does tend to test and stretch our beliefs and it is wonderful to know that there is a \\"Loving God\\" in control of the universe. I thank Dr Alexander for sharing his experience.

B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|I've listened to every album Lady Gaga has ever released many times, and while they're all very good, she's truly outdone herself with ARTPOP! The only song that might throw some fans off is Jewels N' Drugs, as Gaga isn't really known for having rap songs on her albums, but she really does sound excellent when she's singing, no matter what genre. If you're a fan of Lady Gaga ARTPOP will not disappoint!
B00GCMNUZC|5.0|Nice collection of greatest hits and two great new songs.  Can't wait for more new music from The Killers or Brandon Flowers in the future!
B00C7607BC|5.0|It was wonderful. I first saw this movie when I turned 16 with my family. It was great to share it with my children.
B00EW9GQR6|2.0|I was so slay by the time the Fame Monster came out. That it turn an event everytime Gaga realease an album or video.<br />Btw was good but I didnt reach the fame Moster levels.<br />Still, I get exicted when she told us the the album of the decade is called Artpop. But the results are not good. I just would call it album of the month.<br />The lyrics are a great what??? It is clearly she is obsessed with become an artist not matter what. At then end you will think why she just can sit and record unpretentious pop songs.<br />I mean the are two song about glorifying drugs.... reallly?? Is that Art??<br />I am sorry Gaga but you have to wait for the people in general and the critics to call if your songs are art. Not by yourself.
B000031WBV|5.0|Of course Rubenstein is a master of Chopin, what else to expect... But what I didn't expect was the quality of the recording to be outstanding as well.  I own many CD's and High Res downloads and this by far is the best piano recording I have.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Don't really like connect 3 games but this one is fun and challenging. And now I'm just putting words down so I can continue.
B005LAII4E|5.0|I thought that this movie is awesome. I thought that g.i. joe 2 was better than the first movie. I hope they do another one. I love the g.i. joe films. I was kind of disappointed that they killed duke off that sucked he was a cool character. I was surprised to see stormshadow I thought he died in the first movie. if they do make a third film hope its good as the first two or better. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I'm a huge fan of Gillian Flynn, my favorite of her books being Dark Places. I liked this book, but it doesn't live up to the standards I set for Flynn's writing. I also really loved Gone Girl. Out of all of her books this is my least favorite. It did have the Gillian Flynn twist I was seeking and it was an interesting story.
B0090SI4OC|5.0|I didn't think I would like this movie. but I actually do. this movie is awesome. I thought that this was a lot better than twilight in so many ways. don't get me wrong twilight is good but I like the host better. I have to read the book I thought that the main actress did such a good job at her character. and all the other actors did good two. the story was awesome. I like the idea that that may actually happen I hope not though. well all in all it's a great movie. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do
B00EJGMCG6|5.0|This CD shows once more you can never go wrong with a Testament release. This is a live CD but you may easily forget that while listening as the band delivers their songs at a quality and perfection that is hard to put into words. If a comparison is allowed, I remember my last Metallica concert, where everybody in the audience just wanted to listen to the old tracks anyway, and the band did not even try to play their new material. Testament play several songs from their newest album here and also from the album before and the crowd obviously loves it. Just listen to the excitement when \\"True American Hate\\" starts. Simply shows how Testament, unlike Metallica, have consistently produced great music over the years, including the very recent years, and on a live CD like this one they can still play their oldest tracks such as those from The Legacy and The New Order, those from their mid-career such as Practise What You Preach and The Gathering and now the newest ones. I am enjoying this live material very much. Absolutely worth the purchase!
B0043URV5U|5.0|Unlike the Greatest Hits album, this album not only has his best (and most of those on one of the two discs), but the album title and individual track titles are digitally encoded, so they appear on your computer screen, the nav screen (which shows CD album and song titles) of the auto, etc., and thus are easily amenable to loading into an iPod Touch, so that you can find the particfular album and songs.  I had two Greatest Hits albums shipped to me, and in neither case did the album and individual track titles appear automatically when played.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Easy reading as the story unfolded seamlessly and you got to become very familiar with the protagonist. For a young adult work of fiction, however, I found the dark and disturbing premise hard to accept so I quickly skimmed over the gory parts which probably made me miss some essential hi lights. I have not been desensitized to violence and pray that neither have the majority of the young readers. I am hopeful that the next two will be less so because the book definitely has some redeeming qualities.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|One of the best books i've read, however most of its charm comes from all the references to geek stuff, so I recommend it only if you're into that kind of things.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I liked both books of the series and plan on reading the overlander trilogy. Overall a great trilogy that's worth reading
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It keeps me occupied. There's a lot you can accomplish at once, but a lot of waiting for other tasks to complete as well.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Love the new album, eminem fan, great songs new stuff. Digital dowload with it is great cloud player is free and easy to use.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Best Superman movie to date, and one of the best comicbook films as well. Wonderful acting, solid drama, and slick action make this a movie not to miss.
0684857219|5.0|Good book so far wrote by Arnold the most famous bodybuilder ever, so the information will be great and useful you know it works. Big book good and lots of pics, detailed workouts exercises and diet information. Price was great for a book this big.
B00594XOZU|3.0|It does not even work anymore it is very frustrating for me not to be able to talk to my friends
0321934318|5.0|clear instruction, light-hearted but professional approach by one of the premier Lightroom authors. This book can be used sequentially or on an as-needed basis. It also has online supplements.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I am not a Lady Gaga fan, but I must admit that I gave ARTPOP a listen and I liked it. This is an album to be play at the club. My only complain is the song DOPE it trows me a little bit off. But over all, this album might be my guilty pleasure.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|I think this is a great game however I think they need to lower the price of the black spider suit.  If you were to buy the points it would cost you 50$ just for the suit and 5000extra spiders.  Oh and I wouldn't suggest getting the camera because you can't do much with it. otherwise it is a great game and I highly recommend it :^)
B008JFUPK8|5.0|There have been numerous opinions about positive and negative points dealing with this film. No movie will ever be perfect and please everyone but I have to applaud Zack Schneider for giving us a new vision of Superman never seen on screen before. When 'Superman Returns' came out in 2006 most fanboys were screaming about having no action in the film. \\"Superman didn't even throw a punch\\" was a common critique. Well, WB heard their complaints and made a 180 degree turnaround. As far as I'm concerned, they went from one extreme to the other. I've described this film to others as a rollercoaster ride that rarely stops. It's shocking how much is thrown at you during the course of this story.<br />You will not see a Clark Kent with perfect parents who bake apple pies and have the perfect answers for any questions Clark has. You will not see a completely happy childhood where little Clark has no real cares and worries until his father dies. You will not find a Superman who has all of the answers of exactly what he needs to do to solve a problem. This is a movie where Clark is uncertain who he is and doesn't necessarily want to have his powers and abilities that set him apart from everyone else causing him to be a target by others. He learns how to control his anger with people he would be able to turn into a pretzel if he wanted to. He does not know how to deal with another kryptonian named Zod who wishes to rule planet earth. He just knows he needs to stop him from this alien invasion.<br />There are a few scenes that I believe were inspired partially from the Avengers. When Superman is handcuffed and marched into custody it is almost exactly the kind of shot used when Loki was marched to his cell in the Avengers. Near the end of the film there is an invasion that also takes me back to be Avengers inspired. Is that bad? I would say no. Zack Schneider had a tremendous undertaking to take a hero who was losing interest to Batman and give him a huge comeback while also setting up a DC universe of films at the same time.<br />There were big changes made to Superman's origin story. There are changes in how his father dies. His fortress of solitude is very different than what you imagine in any other Superman film before it. But none of these things take away from the identity of the character of Superman. Only people like me who grew up with the Reeve version may try to compare films like this.<br />Of course, there is an extremely controversial ending. If you don't know what I mean, this is a SPOILER ALERT.... Superman makes the ultimate life or death decision to either allow Zod to continue his mission of death to all humans or stop him. In one pivotal scene he makes the quick decision to break Zod's neck rather than allow him to do any more killing and destruction. Some people were screaming how Superman doesn't kill. They need to realize that Superman has killed before. For goodness sakes, he fought and killed Doomsday in the comics. In Superman II he allows the three Kryptonian villains to fall to their death. In Schneider's world Superman doesn't have the hard and fast rule that you NEVER take a life. He made this decision based on the basis of a killer who cannot be killed. And now he will live with it for the rest of his life. For this Superman, it probably is the origin of the no-kill rule. It's going to be interesting to find out how they deal with this in the next installment.<br />I loved the casting. Russell Crow is a wonderful Jor El. There are also ties to other Superman shows. Diane Lane was in \\"Hollywoodland\\" where she played the girlfriend of George Reeves, the actor who portrayed Superman in the 1950s. By the way, I also was very excited to find out Ben Affleck will be Batman in the sequel because he played George Reeves in the previously mentioned movie and donned a Superman costume. Lois Lane Amy Adams was in the first season of Smallville. For me it was just fun to watch these characters who had a Superman connection previously.<br />Was it a perfect film? No. Name one film that is. But it does do justice to the world's first Superhero and tried to find a balance between the darkness of Batman and the opposite brightness of Superman. This movie is not a bright one like the previous films. It is shot in a grittier fashion. For those seeking a Superman film with bright scenes and beautiful colors, you won't find it here. Go back to the Reeve films. But Superman is finally given a story that many fans have been waiting a very long time to see. I think it's a very well done film and I hope you do too. Superman flies high and seems to relate to what happens in today's world. I enjoyed it and am looking forward to the sequel in 2015.n previously.<br />Was it a perfect film?

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game I fun for all ages.  My kids and I play every time we get the chance. I would recommend it to everyone.
B000F2C87Q|5.0|Just almost ridiculous, how good this album is!  Blues-y, somehow kind of raw...if you're going to cover a blues legend, you had better do it right...and they most certainly do!  The only &#34;complaint&#34;...only six songs; its over way too soon...HIGHLY recommended!!
B00ELCZSS2|5.0|I have this album on repeat, while I work all day. It's very interesting to listen and I recommend to everyone that likes original music.
B00EUGYM04|5.0|Seether: the best kept secret in music...so good!  The musicianship is substantial, the lyrical content is so profound...just &#34;simply&#34; so, so good!
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Very nice.  Works well and is easy to use.  I'm so glad I have it.  It is a really great feature for my Kindle Fire HD.
B00008O31H|5.0|This is my third Black Keys album, will most likely own them all before I'm done...so amazingly good, I honestly don't know that I could do this CD any justice with words...if you like rock with a heavy blues backbone, don't waste any more time...check out the Black Keys!!
0399159347|5.0|I could not put this book down! The way author Liane Moriarty blends the characters together is incredible, with a rich plot line that quickly draws the reader into the story. The test of a great book, is, in my opinion, whether at the end of the book, I still care about the characters. Finishing the book late last night, I did. This is the book I will have for my next book club meeting. This is an outstanding book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So addictive I am always on it. Time well spent when it comes to this game. I do not have no problems with this game run perfectly.. give it a 10 and 2 thumbs up
B00F8OUBXE|5.0|LET ME START OFF BY SAYING METAL CHURCH RELEASED THEIR SELF TITLED ALBUM \\"METAL CHURCH\\" IN 1985 AND THEIR FOLLOW-UP \\"THE DARK\\" IN 1986. BOTH OF THESE ALBUMS ARE ICONIC MUSIC FROM THE METAL UNDERWORLD OF OLD AND WERE THE ONLY TWO METAL CHURCH ALBUMS (IN MY OPINION!) THAT WERE TOP NOTCH \\"OLD SCHOOL\\" HEAVY METAL. THE NEW ALBUM \\"GENERATION NOTHING\\" SEEMS LIKE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN RELEASED IN 1987/88 AS THE FOLLOW-UP FROM \\"THE DARK\\" AS IT SOUNDS LIKE THE FIRST TWO ALBUMS DID. THE SINGER RONNY MUNROE SINGS IN THE STYLE OF DAVID WAYNE \\"GOD REST HIS SOUL\\" AND THAT IS A DAMN GOOD THING! SIMPLY BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT MOST OF US OLD SCHOOL FANS OF METAL CHURCH WANTED. IT BRINGS BACK THE SOUND THAT MADE THESE GUYS RECOGNIZABLE IN THE FIRST PLACE, FOR EXAMPLE: HOW QUEENSRYCHE'S NEW SINGER TODD LA TORRE SINGS IN THE STYLE OF JEFF TATE AND ROB DUKES OF EXODUS SOUNDS LIKE A CROSS BETWEEN PAUL BALOFF AND STEVE SOUZA, OR TIM \\"RIPPER\\" OWENS REPLACING ROB HALFORD. THESE REPLACEMENT VOCALIST'S ONLY MIMIC THE SOUNDS OF EARLIER VOCALIST'S THAT MAY HAVE MADE A BAND MORE SUCCESSFUL OR POPULAR IN THE PAST, BUT THEY ALSO BRING THEIR OWN STYLE INTO IT AS WELL AND \\"IT WORKS!\\". THAT IS WHAT MADE US FANS OF A PARTICULAR BAND IN THE FIRST PLACE! AND LET'S NOT FORGET ABOUT THE MUSIC ITSELF ON THIS ALBUM!!! MY GOD, THE WAY IT IS CONSTRUCTED AND PLAYED IS ALL IN THE SAME DIMENSION AND FORM FROM THE BANDS ROOTS....THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT! THAT IS WHY IT SOUNDS LIKE A FOLLOW-UP ALBUM FROM A RECORD 20 OR 30 YEARS AGO, BUT I LOVE IT! AND MOST OF YOU DO TO. THE NEW ALBUM IS FANTASTIC AND IS IN \\"TRUE\\" METAL CHURCH FORM! I CANNOT WAIT FOR A FOLLOW-UP OF THIS NEW ALBUM....METAL CHURCH IS BACK!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a great game.  They should give out more lives and provide hints after you have been on a level for so long.
0060007737|5.0|Extremely easy and logical read. There are tons of branding mistakes in the world. I think the author is correct on many counts. Although I disagree on the E*Trade brand. Although it breaks many of the rules he mentions they seem to over come it with some subtle shifts. We will see with time right.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is very easy to play.  No hang ups which is very nice.  I like the ability to change card backs and card fronts.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Like it because it is great.  I like trying to figure it out.  It is challenging and good for my brain.
B00B8R1NP0|3.0|I love crime novels. I love forensics. I love a good mystery. What I do not love, is figuring out the whole plot a couple of chapters in. The only reason I kept reading was to make sure I was correct in my assumptions.<br />There were several inconsistencies I noticed throughout the story. One of the mail character's hair is described as being a  different color, with no mention of it having been dyed. A minor character's last name suddenly changes. Weird grammar, strange third person point of view...meh, not the best crime novel to say the least. Disappointed. Could have been a lot better.
B00499NHLC|4.0|Very fast paced and interesting show.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is a little confusing.
B00DYQLEZM|4.0|I was not very sure if I really wanted this box set or not. I did some research, mainly, what exactly was included here. I already had some of the CDs, so to buy a box set with stuff I already had was not something I was very happy to do. However, the Amazon price was very attractive, so I decided to go ahead and buy it. I paid $100.49 for this, so that meant a couples of bucks for each CD, which is a real bargain.<br /><br />I am not going to spend time discussing here whether the Berliner Philharmoniker is one of the best orchestras in the world or not. It is in my Top 5 list. This is a very personal choice, so this may or may not help you decide to go ahead and get this box set. Unless you have most of these releases already.<br /><br />This may be obvious, but the core of the box set is Herbert von Karajan. A total of 15 CDs are his signature. Among them, Beethoven's 9th (1963), Mahler's 5th (1973, his first Mahler ever, and my favorite one), and Schostakovitch's 10th (1982, magisterial!) are among the best of this box set. You can also find his Bizet's Carmen (highlights), Wagner's Parsifal (highlights), and Mozart Great Mass. The Schoenberg is included, but beware, this does not match the Legendary Recordings editions. There, his Verkl&auml;rte is paired with Pelleas. Here, the original CD is presented, which includes Verkl&auml;rte Nacht, Variations for Orchestra (a must IMHO), and Webern's Passacaglia.<br /><br />After Karajan, you have B&ouml;hm and Abbado. My favorite Abbado here is Prokofiev and Ravel Piano Concertos with Martha Argerich. I have most of Argerich's recordings on EMI and DG, so again, nothing new, but for those who don't know her, or don't have this particular recording, this is perhaps the best interpretations you can listen to. Abbado has done a lot of Mahler, and his 4th (2005) is included here. Also Beethoven's 7th and 8th are included (I believe these are the same ones he published on DVD, which I also own). B&ouml;hm is represented with 3 CDs. Beethoven's Missa Solemnis, Mozart's 40th and 41st, and highlights of his Zauberfl&ouml;te.<br /><br />The rest of the box is very mixed, with recordings as old as Nikisch Beethoven's 5th from 1913 (horrible sound, of course), or Furtw&auml;ngler Beethoven 5th (1926, more horrible sound), to Rattle's Dvorak's biblical Songs (2012, so new, the CD does not even have art cover for it!). In between, Beethoven's Piano Concerto NO. 5 (two: Kempff and Pollini), Beethoven's 9th (two: Karajan and Fricsay), Dvorak's Cello concerto (twice -?!-, but the Rostropovich in my opinion is absolutely essential), Dvorak's 9th (two: Fricsay and, thank you! Kubelik!!!), Bernstein's Mahler No. 9 (Karajan's 9th version of Mahler also included), Boulez's Ravel Bolero, etc. I'd suggest you go to DG's website to read the contents before you purchase, to make sure you like what's included, or to double check your collection and see if you already have most of this.<br /><br />The box is nicely packaged, and the CDs are contained in cardboard sleeves. Most of them come with the original art work, except for CD #50, and the first 10. A libretto is included, but unlike other reviewers have noted, I don't find it to be exemplary at all. It's 96 pages long, and it comes with `A word of greeting from the Berliner Philharmoniker,' `The edition of the century.' `The Berliner Philharmoniker and DG: A creative partnership of 100 years.' These texts are in English, German, and Japanese. The booklet explains the way this selection was done, which was by asking patrons of the orchestra to decide which releases to include. I find this to be a very original way to approach a box set like this, although the results will not be satisfactory for some. The booklet is completed with the track lists of all CDs, and a final index by composers (39 composers in total!).<br /><br />Pros: Price. It includes some of the greatest classical recordings of all time (although you probably have them...).<br />Cons:The few operas represented are only highlights. Although understandable in a box set, it would have been better just to not include them at all, or include two full operas (I'd say Wagner's Parsifal by Karajan, and Mozart's Magic Flute by B&ouml;hm). A lot of repeated works. You may have many of this releases already.<br /><br />In summary, this is a great collection of excellent classical music recordings by one of the greatest orchestras of all time. This box set will be out of the market soon, and therefore, hard or impossible to find. If you like the Berliner Philharmoniker, Karajan, or just classical music in general, get it while it is available, especially at the $100 price. You may want to pass it if you have most of the albums here, though. Not essential, but highly recommendable. Thus, 4 stars. Thank you for reading.The few operas represented are only highlights.

B00AGOGOLE|1.0|I got this app due to all the good reviews. But as soon as I wanted to use the video camera, it stopped working and never did. After a lot of headache, I finally contacted Amazon and their Kindle app Help etc. They finally told me, that it has been CONFIRMED BY AMAZON, that this app IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE KINDLE FIRE HD!!!!!  So even though it says that's what it's for, IT WON'T WORK!! Don't waste your time and energy and download something that will only cause you trouble!
B00FVZAPB8|4.0|I bought the Target special edition yesterday, and this is so good I felt compelled to write a review. The Target edition comes with bonus tracks (12+2+1=15 tracks) AND the DVD 'A Rendez-vous With Paul McCartney,' a 22 minute outstanding and essential video interview that shows the 'Out There' tour. The Target price is $16.99 plus taxes, but yesterday it was marked down to $12.99 plus taxes. Just for the DVD, this is worth the price. But wait ... the CD itself ... !!! Oh my ... top notch! The first time you listen to this, it hooks you up already. The more you listen, of course, the better it gets. I find many different moods and musical places where I feel comfortable, challenged, comforted, and lifted. I have most of McCartney records, and of course, all of The Beatles albums. I'd rank this new release among the Top 10 of Paul's records (I am not considering The Beatles in this Top 10, obviously). This release comes with a very nice booklet with lyrics, many beautiful pictures of him and the band, and the gatefold contains a letter from Paul to us, the fans ... He calls us 'Dear you ...\\" Very moving! If you like The Beatles or Paul McCartney, this is a must. I'd definitely recommend the edition with the DVD because of the added value. Again, Target has the best price around.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|It's a fun game!  However it is a little bit creepy, and stuff does jump out at you, so be careful! Hope the second one is coming out soon!
0062119044|4.0|Wow. What a journey.<br /><br />This book seemed to go on forever. Somehow it felt like 4,000 rather than 400 pages. It was psychologically taxing all the way, and entertainingly so.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the use of the 1st and 2nd person narrative, the deadpan delivery, and the glorious prose.<br /><br />The experience has left me in shock.<br /><br />Natasha Holme<br />Author of 'Lesbian Crushes and Bulimia: A Diary on How I Acquired my Eating Disorder'
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I read this book because I really enjoyed the film. In the beginning of the novel I kept imagining the characters as they were in the movie. By the middle of the book everything changed. Suddenly I was discovering new characters who were compelling and complicated: people I was caring about and rooting for. I also found myself laughing. For such a sad story there was always hope and love. In so many ways that is all  we have. It is a bit ironic that after reading the novel, I am now disappointed in the film. The book had so many beautiful details that the movie skipped. The film combined things and changed characters.  It added silly details that were not in the book and deleted some poignant scenes. The novel is a worthwhile read. I found it hard to put down.  I found myself wondering about the characters.  I found myself talking about them with my family.  The story reminded me that people really do need love and hope in their lives. You won't be disappointed.
B005BZQS1E|5.0|As my title suggests, I thought that this was a funny movie.  It's unlike any movie that I've ever seen and totally original.  It's a RAUNCHY movie that takes place during the Middle Ages.  The crude humor, and free flowing and modern-day profanity is just hilarious.  Not only is it a funny movie, it's actually a really well-written adventure/fantasy story that could easily stand on its own.  It's just funny as hell.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|I enjoyed this thoroughly. It stands well on it's own, but is way better in context with the show. You'll find in the book references to the research that Castle did with Beckett, or comments that were made by some of the characters in different episodes (for example, the scene in the show where they go over  all the terms for a perp, with Castle writing them all down come out in the book as well.) It was moments like these in the book that made it such an enjoyable read for me. The sex scene is even on page 105, just like Castle told Beckett in the show. Hilarious! If you are a fan of Castle, you will enjoy this book.

B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|Lady Gaga is a very talented ARTist; who has written a fantastic POP album. It's deserves a listen; the variety of genres Lady Gaga explores on ARTPOP mean there is almost certainly a song that will fit with your taste in music. You may not like the persona who is Lady Gaga but you can not deny her technical and creative ability in performance and songwriting; which is why you should give ARTPOP a listen. You might be pleasantly surprised!
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|A great fun movie.  Reminds me of days when we didn't take our entertainment so seriously.  I would recommend buying it.

B00EKHE1JA|2.0|This figure is not what it looks like. The picture is way to different from what you get. I got Crimson Typhoon from series one and that one is fully detailed compared to Striker Eureka. Striker looks like whatever transformers toy for kids you find on any cheap store. Even the hands are different. Mine came closed. Just to make things worse, mine came broken. The package was awful and the arm was cut out from the body. I'm furious about this. I don't know if I can return this item since is already opened or if there is even a solution about this complain... But tanks amazon for the worst time of my life in months...

0064400557|5.0|My daughter had to read this book for school and they were tested on three chapters at a time.  The teacher didn't want them reading ahead so it kept her wondering what was going to happen.  I must admit, I never did read or watch the story when I was a child so it is really interesting to me as well as my 3 year old.  Every pig we see now is called Wilbur!
B009LDCZDC|5.0|The second season is even more fascinating than the first season.  You just never know what will happen, and the acting is superb
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|lots of fun, only issue is losing lives and having to wait to play later on.  Many of us who play who are working or busy all the time and can only get online it would be nice to not have to wait for lives. it may be days before getting back online to play as busy life and on limited budget so cannot afford to buy lives.  Still fun to play. Been playing on facebook since it started.  Also would like to see the Nook tablet be able to get it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I am on level 444 and can't play that level on my Kindle Fire, so I wish it would update ASAP. I love this game so much and I want to keep playing!
B002SJIO5E|5.0|Product well presented, blue ray great visuals. HOWEVER this move is NOT about the violence. The underlying story and stark realities and contrasts as seen in the SOUTH AFRICAN history is highlighted here. Put the current problems on the table and you have a move that's well thought through and NOT for those with no understanding of the history of where this movie plays out. So I understand the one dimensional reviews here, however all that does is show your lack of depth. ALL OF YOU WITH 1 STAR RATINGS !<br /><br />I suggest you read about the South African history before watching this, as it has many parallels with history and current issues.<br />This movie is much more for the intellectual than the idiot !<br />some hints<br />-Prawn = black person<br />- cat food = drugs<br />- Prawn population explosion= current population explosion<br />etc<br /><br />ENJOY !<br />ps Halve the movie will go you by as it has a great deal of slang in it!<br />REALLY WELL MADE THOUGHT THROUGH MOVIE !!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|It would be a lie to say Roth is not a phenomenal writer and able to pull her readers in with a realistic beautifully crafted story. Despite the ratings and reviews, I couldn't stop myself- I was desperate to know how she was going to wrap it up.  I truly hoped that I wouldn't be with a majority of the readers hating this book.  I have to admit, up until the end I really enjoyed the story line.  Horrible, horrible, horrible ending to a wonderful trilogy.  It was depressing, and I truly wish she'd have gone another direction.  Roth could have gone SO MANY different ways than the path she chose.  As a result, she murdered the trilogy and disappointed her fans.
B00881VLCE|1.0|This game just did not seem to work and kept taking me somewhere on the web.  I deleted it immediately.
B003L77G06|5.0|Great feel good show. Every character is unique and hilarious. Me and my significant other love the different story lines
B007N8RULO|5.0|CHALLENGING and fun.  Also addictive.  Easy to play.  I like the stats the game keeps.  It gives me a running total on my score.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|The Goldfinch is the best book I have had the pleasure of reading.  It grabbed me the instant I started reading and fell into an amazing and beautiful journey.  The descriptions and characters became so real and fascinating.  The constant suspense is terrific!  Wow!
B008J2GAKU|5.0|I love the direction they are taking Batman in here. It's gritty and dark which is what I love about Batman tales. I find myself reminded of the dark knight returns in both the illustration and story. Great read and definitely made a fan out of me.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I think it is okay all you do is fly around and shoot things, but if you like that, than its your game.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This is the best i had other realsteel games but this one is best off it all and it FREE u should really get it
B003B02O7I|5.0|Really enjoyed this book---it had less mystery than his boons normally do but he filled that gap with spiritual and emotional gems that pulls his readers in without being preachy. Loved the ridiculousness of the heirs too! Entertaining all around even at a different pace. Made me want to toss my watch and head for the sunny swamps of Brazil...
B008K8VDPU|4.0|It's a very cool and usefully app. It's fun and creative to use especially if u want to learn how to play the piano like me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:):):):):):):):):)
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|In my opinion this is a great book. A combination of the best things from the 80s in a MMOG, great twists that will keep you guessing.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I've never been one to trust third-party companies but this is the first that does it well! I Enjoy being able to view my subscription videos in 720p and the layout is very similar to the real YouTube's. The only complaints I'd have would be the horizontal screen lock and not having the option to go full 1080p, other than that highly recommended app!<br />.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|At the beginning I really wasn't into it. There were a lot of people to remember. A lot to remember,but as the book went on some of the characters left. So after that I read it pretty fast...Good read but not a 5 star.
B005V5WBFG|1.0|I had this downloaded on to my android device but it either wasn't opening or it kept getting stuck and I had to shut down the whole system. I went to my settings and there was no uninstall button for the app. I actually had to download other software to get it removed.
B009CVRQLY|1.0|This CD plainly sucks, every track, except the first one, the one with ne-yo, and the one with stevie wonder.  The rest of it seems to me that it was written by Data and Spock.
B00BGIC170|2.0|Another Judd Apatow movie -- Funny People comes to mind -- that just grinds on and on featuring material reminiscent of home movies.  Someone has got to exercise a little editorial control over Apatow if that is at all possible.  I'd love it if someone could tell him cut some more scenes! Quit casting your wife and kids! And no more improvisation, use a well-crafted script already
B002I9Z8B2|5.0|This movie is the best of Star Trek, loved it, and this review can be summed up in just one word: KKKKKKKKHHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This one kept me up all night until I finished it. I enjoyed revisiting the characters from Ford county in this new story.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Exciting Game  ---  Realistic driving situations...Various options to improve performance..  Select and upgrade your favorites - cars,, drivers...etc. beautiful graphics
B00E8S2KV2|5.0|The extended version fills in the gaps that, because of time limits, was left out of the theatrical version. So if you are a real fan of these stories you need to own the extended version and not the theatrical version.
034580404X|5.0|I felt I got a very good deal with buying these books as a trilogy! Once picked up it was difficult to put the books down and personally hope for more to be added to this series! These books have everything ,and more, to keep you engaged, into the story line until the very last chapter. I would recommend this to anyone who can go for a love story that also contains plenty of heat and adventure!
