B008PZYHX8|5.0|I quite don't understand what people mean by character-driven and all that, but this movie is one of the most realistic and one of the best 'End-of-World' movies.  It depicts the trauma that people could potentially go thru, difficult triage type of decisions that a free society will have to make, and the sacrifice that people will have to make.  Very well acted and actually has a good portrayal how common people will become heroes.  Imagine the 'Titanic' situation on a whole nation scale!  Very impressive... at least to me!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|My son started playing a week ago and I just watched. Well, now I am winning and have a good idea how it works. Zombies are next.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is the greatest trilogy I have ever read, and I read alot. I honestly can't pick my favourite since they are all so great. I own the three seperate books, the trilogy and The Hunger Games Movie! I guess I am obsessing, but I would recomend it in a heartbeat!
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|This is a very gritty and action police show. The characters are believable as are the story lines. It is a very realistic portrayal of police work in LA.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|THIS SERIES WAS THE BEST, I WAS A STARGATE FAN FROM DAY 1 ... NOW TO SEE THEM AGAIN  [WOW] THANK YOU AMAZON
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Quality video. No lag. Sound was great and you can't beat walking dead for two bucks. I will be finishing this season up on Amazon.
1451696205|5.0|To say much more is to potentially spoil some of the experience. It's my favorite novel of all time; the film is just as powerful. I don't think I'll ever be the same.
B0096DZKZC|5.0|In this sonic game if you buy both episode 1 and 2 you get to play as metal sonic!  yes you read correctly metal sonic!
B003E6LC6I|5.0|I would highly recommend this show. From start to finish it keeps you guessing. I couldn't stop watching it so I stayed up late to finish this season. It was well worth it!
0061537969|5.0|The book arrived in plenty of time for me to enjoy it before our bookclub met.  Not that I needed more than a day to read it.  Once I started it ,the book was hard to put down.  Had great discussions, food and wine at our meeting so in all a great sucxcess.
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|Best book ever!!! (:  I've read it over 0 times! Ha ha I haven't read the dumb thing once! I hate reading!
B001RTSPVY|5.0|We ordered the first season after advice from my brother...  We were so wrapped up after the first season I went to Amazon and ordered the next four. It has to be the most entertaining TV show EVER. DON'T MISS OUT!!!!!
B0053TMP24|5.0|Really good book fun and educates kids and grown-ups I want the next one so baldly read this book it is good
B0098460O4|5.0|My daughter and I absolutely love the CD. Jonathan & Charlotte, thanks to their vocal differences, sound perfect together, and the choice of songs could not be better for their first CD.  Some people complain that the songs have too much orchestration. We are not professional musicians, just play some instruments and like to listen to all kind of music, but we think that the orchestration is beautiful the way it is and for us the CD actually sounds at some points like concert/live version not a studio recording.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I thought I had seen it all when I got Temple Run, I was addicted to it. I could not stop playing it. Then, when I was browsing the appstore, I noticed an ad that said &#34;Temple Run 2 is out!&#34; Since I loved the original, I gave it a try. Now I find Temple Run 2 to be even better than the original Temple Run. This one never ever gets stuck loading, and has not given me any software problems (unlike the original temple run). This app is so much better. Things are more realistic, and there are more obstacles, and helpful pathways as well! (You can ride a zipline, or a cart on rails in a cave!) If you enjoyed the original Temple Run, you will love this one even more.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Amazing series that keeps you wanting more. The story line is well developed and the characters fit perfectly together. Julianna, Christine and Arhcie give first class performances.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|me parece muy serio y valiente el trabajo por los autores de esta obra.<br />todo indica que cualquier tipo de poder político o económico, envenena y ciega al ser humano<br />y parece inevitable el enorme daño que provocan las diversas ambiciones que revela esta obra.
038572179X|2.0|I've browsed through all the low star reviews looking for thoughts similar to mine.  A few people have touched on the ultimate issues with this book, but I don't think others exactly knew what was the real issue behind why they didn't like it.<br /><br />The issues are 1) Way too much description, and 2) because of an over-abundance of description, the book is boring.<br /><br />It is set into three and a quarter parts.  The first part is the 'incident' (which takes a long time to get there), the second part is the war, the third part is Briony all grown up as a nurse, and the last quarter part is Briony as an old woman.<br /><br />Mr McEwan's problem is that he loves his thesaurus.  Three quarters (or at best two thirds) of this book is nothing but description.  An over-indulgence of adjectives and nouns.  I love adjectives and nouns where pertinent to the story.  I love when authors create an atmosphere for my mind to conjure and explore.  Mr McEwan's long winded fluffing is completely unnecessary.  Pages and pages of descriptions of things (most of the time with zero (no really - ZERO) dialogue or action or involving people) we only witness once and of things that don't matter: a fountain, a gate, the trees, the path.<br /><br />If you took out all the description, this book would probably be only 70 pages long.  There is probably only 20 pages of dialogue, and 20 pages of action (action meaning not exciting stuff, but movement, like people walking to another area, or dressing someone's wounds).<br /><br />The first part is so boring and long-winded you wonder why you're still reading it.  The second part (set in the war) means absolutely nothing to the story, and could be erased without affecting the overall story at all.  The third part is by far the worthiest, and most enjoyable.  Briony helps in a medical establishment for men coming back from the war.  This had the most 'action' and the most drama.  I enjoyed this section.  The last section is pointless, of Briony as an old women.<br /><br />After finishing the book, I didn't get a sense of 'atonement' at all.  I actually didn't 'get' this book.  Yes Mr McEwan is a very intelligent man with a good eye for detail and place settings.  There is no doubt as to his possession of an incredible array of words, but that very fact alone detracts from what he was trying to write.  His book was more about 'how many words from the thesaurus can I put in here' rather than an actual story.<br /><br />Even more astonishingly, I decided to watch the movie after reading the book.  Although the book was incredibly tedious and not at all powerful or engaging, the movie was a complete and utter travesty.  It was missing SOOOOOOOOO many aspects of the book that I DID find important, that you simply cannot engage with the characters, or the plot of the movie.  The book, surprisingly, exceeds the movie by a mile.<br /><br />If you enjoy pages and pages of description with a slow moving plot, excellent.  Five star reviewers will be glad to have another club member.<br /><br />Otherwise, I recommend neither the movie, nor the book.Briony as an old women.<br /><br />After finishing the book, I didn't get a sense of 'atonement' at all.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book sucks if you like boring things. In another words this is a really cool book. Buy it. It would be money well spent.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I Love Love Love this game !!  Many levels to go though, great challenges , you can play the free version to see if you like it, if you do, then its only $1.99 for full version. It's a match 3 game to rebuild the Tree of Life, you see the tree of Life being built as you complete each level. The game is not hard, just great fun. Buy it , Buy it , Buy it !!  you will not be disappointed! I play the full version 3 times now and still Love this game! The Best game I have ever bought on my Kindle Fire!!
B008XG1X18|4.0|Full of great ideas. Very useful program.I enjoy going through this program in my spare time. Lots of great info.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|I love Jane Austen stories. Northanger Abbey is a wonderful love story. My only regret is that it ended to soon.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone interested in a compelling tale of madness and genius and how he contributed to the music industry, technology and movies.  It kept me interested (all 680 pages).
B00028HBKM|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever made. Like the Ten Commandments it brings the Bible to life on the screen so that you understand it better. I love when true stories become movies. This is a true Bible story, but I love how it brings it character to life.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Originally I shied away from this book because I felt like it would be one of those &#34;woohoo, look at me, I'm such a bad***!!&#34;  But it wasn't.  Surprisingly humble, the author relays a riveting set of events.  Okay so he's not the most brilliant writer to ever put a book to market.  So what?  He's clearly pretty damn good at being a SEAL.  I have worked for the last 10 years as a civilian contractor in several of the locations he talks about in this book, so it was particularly sobering to me as I could picture very clearly many of the surroundings, circumstances and events he described.  A worthwhile read, definitely pick it up.
B004T0E2S8|5.0|Good search feature, simple lay out of chords, and useful transposition tool. I already liked the website, and the app was great.
B005LAIIA8|5.0|Very sweet story about a very special dog.  Lots of good tongue-in-cheek humor, too.  I love these combo packs, as well.  Rarely do I have to choose now from buying the Blu-ray or the DVD, I can get both for a very reasonable price.  Thanks, Amazon.  :)
B007JNWJMI|5.0|Really helps with the pictures on my Kindlefire. Its easy to use and really helps bring the best out of the pictures you take
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games is dark, and quietly horrific: the concept of such brutality - between children, and for entertainment - was hard to take at times. The Hunger Games are harsh, unforgiving, relentless and cruel.<br /><br />But the book is also a love story, and a tale of friendship, courage and hope, and the desire to live. The tenderness and sorrow shown in the 'Goodbye with flowers and song' scene made me cry.<br /><br />I read the book in three sittings, and when I was not reading I was thinking about the characters and the world of Panem. A tremendously powerful opening to the series.
B004JN1D2I|2.0|A Game of Thrones: Amazing Book!<br />A Clash of Kings: Amazing Book!<br />A Storm of Swords: Losing a little steam, but I'm still excited!<br />A Feast for Crows:.....oh, this is going to be The Wheel of Time series again. I'm out.<br /><br />Nothing short of an utter literary tragedy. Amazing work that could have gone down as the first epic fantasy series to stand as a beacon of inspiration and hope for the genre in a long time is shamelessly sold down the river in the name of pumping our wallets as much as possible. I absolutely reject the notion that the author, who is nothing short of brilliant, just so happens to find it in the best story telling interest to drag events down to a crawl by book 4. This is the utterly shameless bilking of a franchise and any reader who can not acknowledge the drastic change is only fooling themselves (and has my sympathy). Such is Mr. Martin's prerogative, he can do as he wishes with his work, but I'll not be a part of it any further. If you can leave a story unfinished without suffering great angst, I do recommend the first two as they are really masterpieces of a dark fantasy world that breaks many stereotypes of storytelling. I might even suggest you pick up the bundle in the odd event Martin gets tired of this &#34;game of book sales&#34; and gets back to real storytelling. It's just terribly unfortunate to see such an obviously talented fantasy writer go down the same road as Robert Jordan. The TV show might get away with the drivel that is the 4th and 5th books in the series, but I think even that medium will find it a bitter tonic that is hard to sell. Ironically, I think at that point the more they depart from Martin's writing the better off they will be. They already have The Tudors, this just has more death, cursing and some dragons that don't do much.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|entertaining, hidden object games average difficulty. mini games could be more challenging.  would have liked more interaction with character's during game.
1451627289|4.0|I picked this book up because I love time travel stories. I thought I wasn't going to like it because of the Politics, but that plays a small role in the story.  It is mainly about a guy who goes back in time and falls in love.  Great book, long read!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Definitely addicting. Lots of great diy projects and ideas for storage solutions which everyone needs!! Great for meal planning and recipe ideas too so you can save money by not eating out a lot!!
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|It's been a fun game.  I do get tired of playing it, but do go back ever so often.  It's not a bad game.
B00BG08FKK|3.0|Alright I love Les Mis but I'm not an Audiophile so would rank my opinion as average.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Has everything, you practically listening to the whole movie, which is awesome.<br />-Great insert.  Has info on the cast and a little insight on how it was recorded<br /><br />CONS:<br />-seriously?  Is this the deluxe version?  Not even a proper CD case.  It's printed cardboard folded into a shape of a case.  I expected better quality<br />-Doesn't come with Amazon's cloud player version<br />-Songs are packed into the CDs.  Sometimes couldn't tell when one song stopped and another started.<br /><br />Indifferent:<br />-I'm not totally satisfied in the whole set recording.  A bit rough around the edges.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:  Since it was sung by the actors during filming I expected a different sound to it.  I went in knowing they don't have Broadway voices but this version will take time to get used to.  As for Anne Hathaway, without the visual emotion \\"I Dreamed a Dream) does not have the same impact.  It was still very good.  I took off a star and a half for the overall physical quality of the package.  Also half a star for cramming the songs tightly.<br /><br />BUY, WAIT or NAH?  For a Les Mis fan, BUY.  If you got the highlights CD, WAIT till the price drops.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This is a must read!<br />Very well written.  Would read more from this author<br />Very heart warming. Makes you believe true love is worth fighting for.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|If you haven't ordered this yet...  Why not?<br /><br />Pros:<br />-The best Les Mis film of them all.  Now I loved the 1998 film with Liam Neeson but Anne Hathaway,Samantha Barks and Helena Carter made this film the BEST!<br />-DAMN these actors/actresses are great.  They should all get ALL the awards... shoot give them Grammys also.<br />-DVD & Blue Ray<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Sacha Baron Cohen doesn't watch this movie with you in a Mankini (this might be a PRO)<br /><br />Indifferent:<br />-Ultraviolet... never used it so I have can't say an opinion on the quality.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: It is definitely a great Film.  The \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" was quite moving.  The voices still can't go toe to toe with the live musical but for a film fantastic.<br /><br />BUY, WAIT or NAH?<br />-What you don't have this yet?  Do I have to get Javert track you down and slap you around?  BUY BUY BUY
B007SGM084|5.0|I initially did not think I would like this series.  It seemed somewhat slow, but after I got into the first book the character development got me.  The tension between the main characters was intense and you never knew where it was going to lead.  I hated it when I finished the series!
B001L5VYFI|4.0|I have this on vinyl,reel to reel, cassette, and CD;<br />had to have it on the Fire. Great iconic tunes
B0095P31L6|5.0|The kids loved this one.  Funny from the beginning to the end.  This is a must see for kids of all ages.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think that this game is ok but I don't like that you have to do so much be4 a comp. I like the game overall
0345803507|5.0|Wonderful story.  You are there.  Couldn't wait to read the next book.  It's been around the neighborhood all ready twice.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game feels like one of the arcade games of my youth. It is well developed and has  a surprising number of levels.
0345803485|5.0|Wonderful story.  You are there.  Couldn't wait to read the next book.  It's been around the neighborhood all ready twice.
078322740X|5.0|Absolutely LOVE this movie! So funny & witty... a romantic comedy classic. One of my all-time favorites. I really love the originality.
B00000251N|5.0|One of my all time favs from Neil Diamond.  He never ages!  This is just such an uplifting musical,  A keeper.
B004EPYZUI|3.0|I normally enjoy a movie that is different. This movie not so much. I tried and tried to get into this movie but it was just not that engaging. I liked the premise and I liked the art direction (lighting, set design, costume, etc) and the scenes of action were good. It is the storyline and characters that are lacking in my opinion. They just couldn't draw me in and make me care. Seemed a bit cliche and overdone as well. I was so excited to watch this movie too.
0345803493|5.0|Wonderful story.  You are there.  Couldn't wait to read the next book.  It's been around the neighborhood all ready twice.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Great show, never watches it on tv. Interesting and funny. Watched all of first season in two days. Working on season two
B005LAII80|5.0|Best Movie about Dredd hands down. Great acting, firefights and explosions add to the story and plotline. The action is intense
B0036BK6MW|5.0|This is an amazing movie, I had it and it got stolen.  This is a movie you can watch over and over again, that is why I had to get another copy
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Enjoy playing the game, its better than I thought it would be.  Suggest purchase for young people.  Lots and lots of fun.
B008O037RG|5.0|Great sound, great artwork, and great packaging; my first vinyl record and I love it!<br />Recommended for all Mumford & Sons fan.
0785165975|3.0|Not as great as the 2 Kick-Ass books that came before it. Maybe I was just expecting too much out of this one due to too much anticipation. You can enjoy Kick-Ass vol.2 even without buying this one.
B008MZU8R0|5.0|For the newest Rush album, I found it pretty good.  Some of it definitely reminds me of the creative channels they took in the 90s after the heavy synth-influence they experienced in the 80s.  Overall, a very good album.
1416914293|3.0|Keeps you going with the story from City of Bones, keep me wanting more to read. I like it so far ..
B002T9H2L0|5.0|Arrived fast and as promised.  Very happy with purchase.
030788743X|5.0|Really this book is the best book ever ! I love the story the detail of it. The 80's reference (Since I'm an 80's gal) I saw the recommendations for this book in You Tube and everyone that I have seen they like it so I decided to give it a try and did not  disappoint me at all ..
B009NYF2GQ|5.0|Arrived fast and as promised.  Very happy with purchase.
0385737947|4.0|Another one bite the dust, I read this one after Ready Player one and was great It keep my adrenaline going, I heard some one is making a movie of this book I super want to see it ...
B00378VGGO|5.0|We have loved this movie since we first watched it years ago. Fantastic Mr. Fox continues to be a treasured part of our movie library. Its witty, accessible to all ages, and has plenty of charm and creativity to keep adults and children engaged throughout. I highly recommend this amazing film.
0312641893|3.0|I had really high hopes for this one, i heard great things about it, but for me the story was not that great it was interesting at first but not enough for me to buy the second book. Need it more action .. If i ever read the second book I hope it has more of this ..
B006M4F67A|5.0|This is the first time I have learned to play this game....I'm really enjoying it so far. Thank you! I will buy from this company again
B00797MB0O|2.0|Did not open in my Pc ..  I could not see it at all .. Wht more can I say
B004ZRV3AU|2.0|So, this doesn't work as great as all the videos show. It works, sometimes. It always scores good, but the process itself is what seemed to fail. The glass doesn't always &#34;pop&#34; off with a clean cut. And I mean an inch triangle, not a little bit to be sanded away. But, to be fair, sometimes it does it perfect. It's cheap... Worth a try. If you need something done right, don't use this, take it to a glass shop, or what I found out, a tile saw.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|I was excited to buy this movie for such a great price.<br />gotta love deals like this!<br />Loin King Rocks
B0049985XW|3.0|I have watched Treasure of Sierra Madre and I know that I am going against the general view of this movie, but I found it too slow.  I have a great number of Bogart movies so I did need to get this one to add to my collection.  Also in defence of the movie I generally am not a fan of westerns.
B00BYOEZTI|5.0|The hobbit is an absoutely awesome movie & the great acting is matched by the incredable special effects & beautiful scenery. Spectactular!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|It's nice to have a game that you can play all of the time instead of having to wait for energy to build up.
3836503050|5.0|I bought it as a gift for my airbrush boss and she absoluteley love Gil Elvgrens pin ups. She loved the book!! Its filled up with all (??) of his pin ups and they are all equally stunning. A must-have if you're a pin up lover ;)
B00AMSLRAC|4.0|There are no instructions with this game. None. It doesn't even tell your child what they're growing, so if they don't ask you and don't already know what wheat looks like, they have no clue what they're doing. Yes, it's cute, but I had to walk her through the game a few times and tell her what each plant was myself.  She likes it, so it won't get a bad review, but don't expect it to count as educational.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Great book, good build up and development of story, characters are complex and the political machinations are set to play out with all the elements that only magic can solve
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is where it's at these days and this you can play with others on the same wi-fi or alone. you can can compete/play or just build and be creative. Beware it is HARD to get them away from this game, both our 9 year old boy and 6 year old daughter love to play this.  Once you buy this here you can download it to your android phone or multiple devices and they can all play their own games or log in to their own game (I think that's how it works at least ;-)
B0011Z76RS|5.0|The best of linkin park. An album that contains music's with diverse genres. Specially for people who started listening to linkin park only recently this is a great album that will make u like linkin park even more. The MP3 are in good quality, and easy to download.
B004GYY714|5.0|This app has the things I'm looking for in it, if its sports events , sports talk or a variety of music stations.I like all the music stations because I listen to different styles of music. I can get local or stations<br /> around the country.If<br />You want a radio app that you can use for a variety of reasons I recommend tunein radio app.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|its entertaining but the ads are annoying. it makes me wish I had a real horse that I could take care of.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|IMO, Voyager is the best of the Star Trek series.  There were duds along the way and even some ridiculousness but name one of the series that was not so infected.  Voyager had a few great stories, many good ones and a scattering of really bad ones.  But the writers had a lock on the Star Trek philosophy, explore and meet new species and cultures... and have some really good adventures on the way.  The writing was very inventive and varied.  The acting was always better than adequate.  And Voyager had the best looking women.  So, Trekkers, fire up the display, sit back and enjoy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I never thought I would play mini games as much as I play the big name games but I do. It's good for passing time. The games are really simple and short but you'll keep playing them again and again.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Have had this ap for over a year now and it has worked very well on my kindle fire.  I have not seen the bog battery impacts that some of the negative reviewers have complained about.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I am hooked on this literate and sometimes campy soap. With good one liners and excellent actors delivering those lines, I just had to watch season three, even though I did know ahead how it would end, sadly. I enjoyed the season, but not as much as the other two. Certain plot lines were repetitious and two childbirth related cast exits were lacking in imagination and were gratuitously depressing.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I enjoyed this book from the very start.It kept my interest and I felt for all the characters.I am anxious to see the movie so I can see this story come to life! I think that the serious subjects of abuse, stalking, trying to control others and mental illness are addressed well in this book, as all as family love and commitment.
1609611543|5.0|LOST 30 LBS WITH THIS BOOK'S ADVICE, i CONTINUE TO FOLLOW, IT IS A LIFESTYLE CHANGING BOOK AND IT IS GREAT..
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved it. Great acting, sense of history and cinematography.  And I didn't even need to turn on subtitles.  Keep it coming.
B004SIP8W0|5.0|Excellent movie, great acting, wonderful story....NEVER FORGET...You will watch this movie often, it will make you become thankful for what you have...

B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Liked movie overall,but got tired of constant talking. some scenes where very dark. some were very realistic maybe too much.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Great visuals! covers religions, philosophy and fantasy adventure.  At least you think it may be fantasy.  If you read the book you will love this movie!
B001VS46DC|5.0|This is an execellent dvd and very good Jazz.She is a very good singer and piano player. This Rio is better than the one at the Montreal Jazz Festival
B00ADIT8U2|3.0|I like the game, really like the cheats but it is way too short. I finished too q quickly. Next time I would like they make one I would really like it to be more challenging and longer.
B006TJXZ30|1.0|Only downloaded hotmail.<br />Would be a more useful app if it could combine email accounts..<br />Also description said it synced with calendar and contacts, it doesnt
B000FA675C|5.0|I like this book when it first came out and I read it then.  I've enjoying it again, its a super read.
0316023744|5.0|A wonderful example of a work written with knowledge and research but in a way which is almost as entertaining as a novel.<br />Could not put it down.<br />Highly recommended
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|I have listened to this CD at least once a day since I got it. Liked it so much I bought one for my 21 year old to listen to on his trips home from college. Great to crank up & get you motivated to clean house by! Went & ordered  some of their previous CD's. Realized everytime I heard one of their songs I really liked it before I even knew who sang it! Sorry train but this \\"middle aged Mom\\" loves you!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love that I can watch it whenever I want....I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Downton Abbey
B003K16P3M|3.0|Reminiscent of 'Game of Thrones' for YA. The writing isn't bad and this probably isn't a bad book for its demographic. Probably good for kids who enjoy fantasy.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This my favorite adaptation of Pride & Prejudice. I love the actors, the scenery-I just love the film overall. Classic love story!
B0013D8LOK|1.0|I had no problems with this seller; my transaction was very good and I would recommend doing business with this seller.  I do not, however, like this movie and would not recommend it to anyone to buy.  It is very gory and there is nothng God-glorifying or good in the story.  It was purchased for a family member, so it is not a part of my movie library.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Enjoyed the whole season  it get cancelled or stars didn't want to continue. I enjoy most things that Michael Chiklis does including VEGAS.
0062238868|3.0|The book covers a lot of territory but breezes through the sniping.  I was looking for lessons on windage and bullet velocity and was somewhat disappointed.  Nice story with input from his wife.  Some insight to our Navy Seals training.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I love the old school music, sound effects and graphics while still feeling new. Trying to get the 3 trophies for each level adds an additional challenge.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I wasn't expecting anything groundbreaking when I watched this movie. Very predictable plot. But I LOVED it. It's such a fun movie. The music is great, the cast can sing, and Anna Kendrick is adorable. I've probably watched it a dozen times already--it's my new go-to happy flick.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|everything about this episode was exciting.... kept you guessing for sure, Edge of your seat. Shocked by End of it
B008VO3PA4|5.0|Lmao!!!!this is a cute joking book that shows that cats are very poetic.X) I deeply recommend this books to all cat lovers(^__^)
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great game. Addicted to it.  great game. Did I say great game. GREAT GAME!Did I say great game. byyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy henreyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!
B005DJREJS|5.0|AWESOME! Very entertaining and great writing. Never gets dull, boring, or slow as there are quite a few cliffhangers-which was surprising to me.
B00B2G2RG6|3.0|It was good until the new lead special agent sends the FBI agent home, because Kevin Bacon's character asks him to do something off the books without the lead special agent's knowledge, and while the FBI agent is at home, he is miraculously found by the \\"cult following\\" as if they were waiting for him or told when he'll be sent home and where. It jumped the shark for me right there and it will for you once they reveal the new lead special agent is part if the cult following, not the lead FBI female agent who was raped and whose parents were in a commune. And if she is part of the following, shame on the writers for making it so obvious so early, and for being so simple and predictable. Damn it!  Bacon was back too!
B002L3ARRU|4.0|It is always interesting to watch a childhood film from an adult perspective. Lots of laughs, some of the language is offensive
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Still the best show out. Only gripe, what is with MacGee's voice now being all horse and scratchy. Started happening in season 7, and now it's just annoying, and noticeable. Still good though. Need more special guest female agents to keep the male audience interested...more interested. Plus, Gibbs needs another red head to start hooking up with, not old blonde ladies wearing mock turtlenecks. And no more NCIS:L.A. References or special guest spots as if that show is comparable or that anyone  even watches it. NCIS original, that's it. It jumped the shark the second LL was named to the cast. And it got worse when Chris O'Donnell was castes as the special lead Gibbs jr bad ass. Who's ass is he kicking (insert gay joke here)? He played Robin for Christ sakes! Enough said
B00B2PHSIY|5.0|I used this on a recent dive in Cabo, it made a noticeable difference in depths below 30 feet.  Without it everything was a washed out blue haze, this brought out some more natural looking colors.  Anything above 30 feet has a pinkish hue, but that is to be expected and the ease of taking it off prevents any issues with that.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This is a cute movie, and it is enjoyable. I would recommend this movie. It is a good movie overall.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Kept me reading on my toes and was hoping it would go the way I thought it was going.Can't wait to read Mockingjay.
B000HKYOK0|4.0|It was fun to watch the original Star Trek again after not seeing it for many years.  Costumes are so dated but, it is good to see what the future was supposed to look like.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It is easy to become engaged in this wonderful drama.  The acting, the sets, the writing are all at the highest level.
B000HKYNQ0|4.0|It was fun to watch the original Star Trek again after not seeing it for many years.  Costumes are so dated but, it is good to see what the future was supposed to look like.
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|Like so many people, I was introduced to &#34;Little Women&#34; from the Katherine Hepburn movie (and other later versions) that appeared on TV over the years.  As is so often the case, the movie &#34;cleans up&#34; the book, shortens it, and takes away the aspects that seem old-fashioned for our world of the past 50 years or so.  The movie deletes much of the moralizing that appears in the book.  That said, this is a classic and worth reading to get a glimpse of the 1860s, and the home front situation of a northern family during the Civil War.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is interesting and fun for all ages.  It also represents the movie characters very well.  The graphics are great too..
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|get it asap I love it on the cps but kindle is by. far better love it 5* get it asap
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I grew up in the 80s & 90s.<br />I easily identified with Sam and Charlie.  All the things that Mr. Chbosky wrote about, I could relate to.  Pot Brownies, acid trips, Rocky Horror...<br />The book is powerfully written, I could hear Charlie in the letters to &#34;friend&#34;.  I won't give any spoilers, because I hate when people do that.  I will say that this book really lets a person see harmful we can be to each other and ourselves.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Sixto Rodriguez was one of the most creative musicians in the 60's/70's.  He should have been lauded for his originality and creativity.  How he was able to become an icon in South Africa and an unknown in his native United States is a testimony to the vagaries and chance mechanisms that were in place in those years to identify and promote artists.  Sixto Rodriguez was a victim of this along with others like Eva Cassidy who unfortunately passed away before the industry &#34;discovered&#34; her.  This is a well crafted, intelligent and entertaining presentation of the saga of Rodriguez and the fundamental humility of a great artist that we all missed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Just like real. Lots of fun. Ads do pop up but for a free AP easy to hit back button and keep playing. I downloaded the newer version but haven't figured out where it is. It will keep all data so you don't loose points, etc.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|I loved it.<br />It shipped on time.<br /><br />The only thing that irks me is that the nibs tend to be rather loose and can easily be lost if one isn't careful.<br /><br />Other than that, it was perfect in every sense.<br />They even wrote a little note telling me to enjoy it :D
B005HSG3TC|4.0|This kindle cover is good and fits my kindle well.  My only critique is that the flap that goes over the screen is somewhat flimsy.  I haven't had it long and I've been gentle with it, but I think over time the fold that you can use to prop up your kindle will tear.  However, overall I do like the cover and think it's great for the price.
1869509277|5.0|We purchased this book before a trip to New Zealand, it is excellent, pictures are nice and descriptions are great.
B009IQG5M4|4.0|It's been so long since I seen the movie and my VHS was long gone but decided to wait for the bluray instead of the DVD version. Love the movie,
B000W91RUG|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is hilarious. The first season shipped quickly and arrived on time. I would recommend this product.
B0051T46XM|4.0|Love this movie with the realistic camera movement and just plain funny at time. I wasn't sure if its good but I actually enjoying watching it on Netflix. I decided to get this on bluray for collection.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Seriously, how can anyone smack down such an exceptional product.  The ONLY thing I could think of is price.  Make sure you get a discount.  Too pricey if you can't find one.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I loved this story and the 2nd in the series. really believable and honest. with a fairytale ending! waiting for the third!
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|Wow, the artistry and characters are bar none great.  The visuals are off the charts and the 3D is the best way to go to see this film.  Great transitional film of Halloween to Christmas.
B008OOYALE|2.0|This is a really fun game but don't bother downloading if you are a Kindle or Android User. You won't get any of the updates and you'll get VERY frustrated looking at your IOS neighbors' new dragons knowing that you cannot have the same.
B009S8PEHY|4.0|I always hope a great artist will add to the old time sound and collections.  Rod Stewart definitely stepped up to the plate and made that latest addition to a great line of great Christmas albums.  Everyone tries to do one, but  most come off as rip offs.  This one is quite fresh.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Amazing comic, amazing show! The whole tv show is produced wonderfully especially for regular television! Also an amazing cast of stars.
B005LAIGP0|4.0|The layout of the film, overall creepiness make this a good purchase.  Radcliffe's acting is as subdued as in his Harry Potter role, but he does make the character believable and remote which is needed..  The ending is a HUGE surprise consistent and well put for this genre.
B000YJ6736|4.0|This book was very different since almost the entire story took place on their honeymoon. I found the characters interesting and really wanted to know what was going to happen next.  People have their hang ups and those two certainly did, especially the bride.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Although Renner's character is no Jason Bourne, it was a good move and worth watching.  Would enjoy seeing a sequel where the two protagonist meet and assist the character Pamela Landy, perhaps bringing down the head of the agency, etc.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Outstanding, inspiring, intriguing.  One of my favorites.  This is a tale of an attorney and mother whose husband has betrayed her.  She struggles to be a good person and to stay afloat in the midst of all that goes on in life, politics, legal practice, family.
B00BHMF578|3.0|Nothing about this movie was great; it was an average quality movie that was fairly entertaining about an interesting topic.
B006X5L6VS|2.0|No instructions. Cannot use it. Waste of time and money.<br />Kept getting requests to download more apps for it, sounds like a gimmick.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|Hopkins did a pretty good job of re-creating Hitch, but Helen Mirren was the real star to my way of thinking.  I'd see it again.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book was a lot of fun to read but I hated the ending. Its the problem with a lot of books but this one takes the cake.
B0038P59A0|5.0|This was a fun movie, full of action with a good plot line, and plenty of humor.  I'm not that big a fan of the original books, so I think I prefer this version!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|If you like stories from the pre-civil war era in the U.S., you will probably like this book.<br />It held my attention, from cover to cover!  In my opinion, a very well-written novel.
B005HSL626|5.0|I wish I could cut up my fruit salad as quickly. This is a fun game but beware of the bombs!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We just starting watching from season 1 and recorded the last 7 episodes on our DVR, so needed to view the in between episodes to catch up.  Great effects and you really can get into each actors part as the saga goes on.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is WORTH downloading! It is free and I would have given it five stars if the popup ads weren't so annoying.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Everything about this book is intriguing.<br />You want to know about Abby's past and you can't live without Travis.<br /><br />You want them together but they need to grow. He loves her but she fears that he is the mirror of her past.<br /><br />I wont say more other than I LOVED IT<br /><br />Jude
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love the first hungry shark game & I evolution just as more. It's addicting. Just be careful because you can spend hours playing :)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The decisions these people have to make is just incredible.  I picture these people making these same decisions if they were in a more real world situation....every episode is so intense I need a massage afterwards.....too cool for school.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|its good game pl&agrave;y and everything. but that ear piercing screeching I hear while playing it drives me crazy. I cant even explain the sound. its like a loud, distorted sound the whole time I am playing it. I don't know if it has something to do with me doing it on my kindle or not, but when I play diamond dash on my computer it sounds a lot better. I give it a 2.5 only because of so.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|This was a very good book.  Dan Brown is a fantastic writer and I just love his Langdon series.  Thanks
B009ME47H2|5.0|what can I say the stars say it for me, But it is really nice instead of typing a message to someone
B00BN2CY7G|1.0|I will review again when I can see it!!!!!......help me.....I got nothing to open or the location for the digital booklet.
B005HEVBGG|4.0|Star Trek Voyager is probably my favorite Star Trek series and you just don't  get to see the ruruns on TV.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I had not heard of this book until I saw it on Book TV., ordered and it was one of the best I have read lately. It is down to earth and everyday life.  I have shared with friends.
B00428CCPW|4.0|The vinyl edition means I can finally hear this album without all the compression that is used on the CD version. What a huge difference it makes. It seems artists/labels or whoever you care to blame forgot that music requires Dynamic Range to breathe & make you wanna simply crank it up & let the music surround you.<br />For those who understand this: The DR rating for the CD is a horrid DR6 while the vinyl is DR11. This shows that this mix has more dynamics than the CD & your not beaten over the head by having all the sounds being loud.<br />The records themselves were pretty quiet & the mastering is done well.<br />I'd give this 5 stars if someone had the sense to include a CD or lossless download of THIS mix along with the records so I wouldn't have to needledrop it myself, but I'll end up with a better sounding CD than the official one.<br />If you have a decent turntable, pick this up & finally hear her the way she's meant to be heard.
B002BY77CW|5.0|Yes, this book is definitely a &#34;guilty pleasure&#34; but the ending literally made my jaw drop and I had to immediately download the 2nd book to my iPad. It's a great easy read that I was able to pick up here and there for 15 minutes at a time (a new baby keeps me busy, and I don't always have an hour to sit down and read.)<br /><br />Read the book for what it is, silly, young, and spunky. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quick entertaining read.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This game is way too addicting - causing me to stay up later at night than I normally would to try to beat that level just ONE more time!  :-)  It is truly a fun game.
B00004RJ71|5.0|Maybe it was living in San Diego for almost 8 years. Maybe it was living south of SD in Bonita for some of those years. Maybe it was living and working with a rad mexican guy. But this is and always will be the best film of its kind.
B00AQMSJI2|1.0|My 8 year old was excited when he found this game and couldn't wait to download it. We loaded it onto his Kindle and whn you open it, it just shows the same pic as the ad for it. Tried to fix to no avail. It Stinks!!
B002XTXG1G|5.0|This is not only one bad mother trucker. The movie is incredibly done, and always entertaining. Its through and through just a great movie.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|Mind challenge.  Like that you have the option to get answer to challenging puzzles that I can't figure out. A variety of different mazes.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Best game ever been playing this game non stop for a week now I would definitely recommend this game to anyone would likes casual fun games
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I use this app for school mostly and it is very helpful. I love this app because it keeps a list of words you typed in so you can go back at any time for a refresher, you can favorite any word you choose (especially if you use that word constantly), and it has a Word of the Day. You can share the app with your friends, rate the app, and give your feedback. The dictionary gives the synonym, antonym,  and the origin of the word to name a few. The best feature about the app is it has a voice activator that you can use to search for a word instead of typing it in. This is the feature I use the most. I would recommend this app to anyone. Download it, it's worth it!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I'm so addicted to this game. Once I bought it I could not stop playing it! I have two horses right now and I hope to get more :)
B00479SVBU|1.0|This product is extremely cheaply made, doesn't connect and work like it states and all around a complete waste of money!
B00008G7UF|5.0|Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline work so well together; I wish they would do another movie together....maybe after they married and the trials and tribulation of a relationship like theirs.
1451627297|4.0|11/22/63 is a novel by Stephen King about a time traveler who attempts to prevent the assassination of John F. Kennedy which occurred on November 22, 1963 (the date of the novel's title).  King commented on the amount of research it required, saying \\"I've never tried to write anything like this before. It was really strange at first, like breaking in a new pair of shoes.\\"[9] The novel's time-travel premise marks it as science fiction, specifically the alternative history subgenre, although the extensive period research undertaken by King, dealing with real-life events and people between 1958 and 1963, gives it a strong feeling of historical fiction. This is a step out of his usual writing style for Steven King. I enjoyed reading this book and will probably read it again.
B00001W9G0|5.0|This another love/hate story that keeps you wanting more...and listening to Barbara sing is an added thrill.  I guess when you have lived in the 60's you understand.
B00004U8P9|5.0|A newly engaged couple have a breakdown in an isolated area and must pay a call to the bizarre residence of Dr. Frank-N-Furter.  Stars Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon, Barry Bostwick and others including Meatloaf. The actors are so young here. I wierd movie and a classic.
B0090SI460|5.0|Love this movie looks good on LCD with a nasty surround sound system a must have and if you don't should be ashamed good for all ages
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Winner of three Academy Awards, including Best Picture, director/star Ben Affleck's fact-based thriller casts him as CIA officer Tony Mendez, tasked with getting six Americans hidden in Canada's Tehran embassy out of Iran during the 1979 hostage crisis. The \\"best bad idea\\" Mendez pitches involves everyone posing as the crew of a cheesy Hollywood sci-fi film, a daring ruse he sets up with help from an acerbic producer (Alan Arkin) and a veteran makeup man (John Goodman). I can see why this was a academy award winner. Well worth the time and money.
B00BESJYAY|4.0|The story was good, heart warming, up lifting and the acting was real.  The sets and portrayal of the time and place were authentic it's just the surfing was edited all over the place so don't expect that to be real.
B007REV4T8|5.0|In his 23rd film, James Bond (Daniel Craig) faces his most personal mission yet when the MI6 headquarters become the focus of a terrorist attack. After discovering that the force behind the violence is Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem), a former British agent who has declared vengeance against M (Judi Dench), a weakened 007 prepares for a showdown with his foe--one in which the stakes have never been higher. I love all bond films and this one delivers. Well worth the time and money.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Large variety of soothing sounds.  Love the sleep timer. Always puts me to sleep before the timer expires. Also love the ability to mix sounds into your own favorite, e.g. thunderstorm + air conditioner = Alabama Summer.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Sixty years before \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) is recruited by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) to join a band of dwarves led by Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) on a quest to reclaim their kingdom, leading the young hobbit to the acquisition of a \\"precious\\" magical relic. I loved the Lord of the Rings trilogy, I Found this just as enjoyable. Can't wait for the next one.
B0031RS44S|3.0|Every Reacher book I have read, I have found fabulous reading. The action is brilliantly depicted and the detail is overwhelming. This book is the first exception I have read by Lee Child. The plot is poorly constructed and the denouement is an odd one. I feel sorry for Lee Child. I hope his rnrtgy and creative juices return so that I can enjoy his new Reacher novels.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Airline captain/ recreational drug user Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) awakens in his Orlando hotel room with flight attendant Katerina Márquez (Nadine Velazquez) after a night of sex, alcohol, and very little sleep. After using cocaine to wake up, he boards SouthJet flight 227 to Atlanta. After Whip threads the plane through severe turbulence at takeoff, copilot Ken Evans (Brian Geraghty) flies the airplane while Whip discreetly mixes vodka in his orange juice and takes a nap. Whip is jolted awake just before their final descent and the aircraft goes into a steep dive as a result of an apparent catastrophic failure of all pitch control. Whip rolls the plane upside down to bring it out of the dive and maneuvers the plane right-side up just before crash-landing in a field. He loses consciousness shortly after impact. Great movie, well worth the time and money.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|It is a pleasure to find an author who uses fantasy to tell a significant, subtle story, rather than to show off his inventiveness per se.  PR is such an author, and his Kingkiller Chronicles are a island of smooth, careful craft in a sea of undistinguished spells and swashbuckling.  It's hard to recommend them too highly; the only regret I have is that &#34;Day Three&#34; is still pending!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder is that kind of BOOK that makes you laugh and that makes you cry. Parents, this would be a great book for your children to learn to treat others nicely and to not judge people by how they look. BEST BOOK EVER!!! Great job Palacio.
B001TM14VC|5.0|This is one of my most favorite of all time and will never get old watching it.  A MUST see for an 80's themed movie night!
B00AEFVRB2|4.0|It was good to see Matthew McConaughey in a challenging role.  This movie reminded me of Wild at Heart and Bad Lieutenant. Yes there is some really shocking violence against women, so I thought I wasn't going to like it, but it fit within the overall story arc.
B00358ESI4|5.0|I enjoyed how this movie was made and how they told the story.  I have watched this movie well over 10 times.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|so good I'm watching it a second time.  at first I thought it was an X-Files wanna be, but turns out it's a fantastic sci-fi drama that unfolds throughout the seasons to its surprising conclusion.  LOVE IT!
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|I downloaded this app but cannot get it work on the Kindle Fire. I was trying to get Adobe Flash so I could view magazines from my local library.  So this did not at all give me what I needed.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book grabbed my attention within the first few pages. I loved the way it was written. Not your normal teen romance story. I couldn't put it down!
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|everyone knows Josh Groban's voice, wow.  this is a great<br />cd so far, still need to listen a few more times to know all the words by heart.
B008IGP8RI|5.0|My husband and I have watched this movie many many times and loved the soundtrack.  After purchasing this, we play it frequently just to relax or when we're busy doing something.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|Les mis was a great movie in 1978, and again in 2012.  the music is beautiful and so well-performed that each song takes me right back to the movie.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|When I first purchased this, I never realized how much I would rely on having it.  This goes with me EVERYWHERE!.  Whenever I have a few moments to spare, I am using it.  I love that I can even download free books for children...my grandchildren love it.  If I could only have one app....it would be this!!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I only started watching because it won many awards. It didn't appeal to me at all. I'm hooked and all caught up.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I started over again as I had skipped a season.  I had forgotten all the intereresting plot twists.  Great show!
B00B7Y0206|1.0|After selecting or searching for a video, it shows \\"loading\\" for several minutes, then the screen goes white and it plays the audio only, sometimes.  Other times, it can't get past the \\"loading\\" message.<br />3/30/13: Just downloaded playTube app - this one works well with my 1st gen Fire!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is one of the best series ever. I'm am so pulled into the drama of this series. No wonder the First Lady loves it! I'm a fan!
B005P89F1C|4.0|Arrived in good shape Sounded good My niece loved it Fun collaborations with other artists on Christmas songs  I might even buy a few songs from it for myself
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Got so into the characters I was sad so many were lost. These books really reflect on how we are all so self-destructive and we repeat our poor choices over and over again. \\"But collective thinking is usually short-lived. We are fickle, stupid beings with poor memories and a great gift for self-destruction.\\"
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't wait for season 4. Everything about Season 3, and Downton Abbey in general is superb. The best seried on TV right now.
030758836X|2.0|It was the oddest story I have ever read.  Been reading for over 65 years. Cannot understand how it made the<br />best seller list.
B000J159N8|5.0|A powerful movie about the Vietnam War and what the Warriors on both sides of the war went through from the very beginning and what!
B00BYOEZTI|4.0|Very entertaining. Very much in line with the Lord of the Rings and about the same quality.  Great Production but some times a bit confusing.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Even though Mr Howey presents an intriguing unique setting, his characters fall too flat and the plot is often slow.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Its hard 2 put the book down.....Luv it... It is very similiar 2 fifty shades... If you luved those books....U will enjoy this series also
B008S847X2|5.0|I leave the musical play-by-play reviews to the ''experts,'' but if you like John McLaughlin, you'll like this disc.  Some of the charts aren't all that different from charts on previous albums...every musician has a &#34;sound,&#34; another way of saying there are some continuing themes.<br /><br />Whenever I play his music, it's loud and I listen critically...and I like it more and more.<br /><br />On another note, if you like good fusion, give &#34;Brand X&#34; a try.  &#34;Unorthodox Behaviour,&#34; for instance.
B0012HF5NC|5.0|LOVE THIS MOVIE...HAVE WATCHED IT 20 TIMES AND STILL LOVE IT!!! I'M GOING TO PURCHASE THIS ONE OR SURE ON DVD!!! LOVE IT!!!
B00A4AI19I|5.0|Otto Klemperer, Brahms. One of my very dear composers with one of my favorite conductors. It's as good as one could possible expect... I feel the other reviewers have gone into a lot of detail and I agree with the positive comments.
B005SAV9SO|1.0|DIDN'T LIKE AT ALL.......NOT ONE OF HER BEST MOVIES AND SO MANY &#34;F&#34; WORD EVERY 5 SECONDS & SORRY I PURCHASE THIS MOVIE!!!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|My favorite sister has this app, and I love it! Plus there is a lot of sounds! If you have trouble sleeping, then this is the app for you.
B00BF11STU|5.0|This was a great movie with lots of action and suspense and we really enjoyed it.  I would recommend it.
B001992NUQ|5.0|Fight club is one of my favorite movies. I have seen it soo many times & can always watch it again. Nothing bad to say about this movie.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Fun and addicting! I like that it can be played on easy, normal and hard... Fun levels, lots of different ships to battle.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very charming and fun.  My 4 year old daughter wants a horse and this would  make her very happy.  As an adult, there is enough complexity to enjoy also.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|\\"Defending Jacob\\" is a really gripping read. Jacob Barber is the son of Andy Barber. When Jacob is accused of a classmate's murder, Andy is sent into a tailspin of denial and self-deception, while his wife sees through her son's veneer. Since I've seen this parental nightmare through my mother's defense of my brother, I fully understood the father's blind spot. \\"My son couldn't do this,\\" he thinks, \\"not these sweet babe I brought into the world.\\" Throughout his life, Andy denied his parentage. He could admit to no one, not even himself that his father and grandfather were murderers. This revelation forms the pivotal point in the narrative.<br /><br />The dilemma has been presented in different ways, most notably in the movies, \\"The Bad Seed\\" and \\"The Good Son.\\"  The setting in Newton, Massachusetts brings to mind the recent mass murder in Newtown, Connecticut; the situation, the murder of Natalee Holloway ostensibly at the hands of Jan van der Sloot. Do we accept that in child rearing it's nature versus nurture? Can parents do nothing to change the pathology of their child's DNA? If it's true, what do we do with children who have the \\"murder gene\\"? It's a scary thought.<br /><br />Another frightening topic the novel touches on is the effect of daycare on a child. In light of today's working mothers, daycare provides a necessary service. If the caregiver is changed too frequently, however, what is the danger of Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD)?<br /><br />In the character of Andy, Mr. Landay derides the jury system. I found this argument a bit specious and conceited, as though judges and lawyers cannot be tainted somehow. It's something to contemplate.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I played this game on my phone for months and loved it.....until it started crashing all the time and finally wouldn't open at all. Hoping not to have same problems on my kindle.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE AND ITS EVEN BETTER IN 3D . Highly recommend it to anyone that likes Avatar. You can't go wrong. It was like being in the movie ourselfs as we sat on our couch and viewed it.
B00BVYKWJI|5.0|Very well done series.  Made me want to look into the live of the Borgia family a bit more.  Jeremy Irons is stellar in this role. The supporting cast is also very believable.  Wish there was a whole lot more intelligent stuff like this on TV.
B00942X8PY|3.0|This is fun but I would have liked more instructions before being thrown into the game.<br />(The '4 more words required' to complete this review.)
B007KOMTUI|3.0|this is an interesting view of its times and mores.. it has become a bit predictable.. but still reflects the times and is therefore watchable at least once... background of Vietnam is  well done.. wonder if everyone has those memories....
B0044C3RB4|5.0|The entire season was well written.<br />It was captivating and suspenseful.<br />A fun ride and I can't wait to see the next season
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book-I'm not much of a book worm but this book was awesome.  I read  the other Colleen Hoover books after reading this one and they were all great as well!!!
B0077EBWVI|4.0|I liked the first movie and was excited to see Juliana Hough in this one. It was pretty good but still prefer the original movie.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Great book in the series-All of Colleen Hoovers books so far have been great!  Loved it and cant wait too read more from her!
B006TJXZ30|4.0|Hotmail has been my main email for at least 10 years, and now it works great on my Kindle. Nice features .
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is an excellent series and being able to purchase and watch on my computer is fabulously convenient! Overall thrilled about this purchase.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Not a bad clock. A few more different clock faces would have been nice. Good selection of ring tones, though.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|This book helps the reader see through the eyes of a person with Alzheimer's as the disease takes hold.  My only complaint is a less than sympathetic treatment of the legitimate needs -- and frustrations --  of a husband who is trying to balance a career he loves, and that has a shelf life of many more years, with the demands of care-giving.
B00A861QMM|1.0|Ok this was a really bad game. I saw the reviews and didn't know what people were talking about when they said the voice not matching the mouth, but it really WAS bad. What they meant was their mouths don't move at all but you hear them speak. It's really stupid. And 5 tasks in it makes you purchase if you want to continue. I uninstalled it because it was really boring and the tasks are childish. All but 2 of the first 5 scenes you are looking for pieces of paper outside a house. How can you figure out if you want to buy it if your just finding paper? It looked really good but I actually fell asleep playing this. Not worth downloading. I saw the reviews but wants to make a judgement for myself. I did...Really bad.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|already bought another book by this author.  Defending Jacob, is different (in story line) and a good read!! buy it.

B00AFYZDL2|5.0|Saxon's Sacrifice is a rockin old school/modern British Heavy Metal album. Biff Byford's vocals really stand out and are as strong as ever!!! I am glad I bought the cd, you will be too...
B006GWO5NE|4.0|My kindle support Rep Dana was very personable!!<br />My Kindle Fire 7 is very new , maybe under 1 month, but didnt open it til 2 weeks ago, given to us as gift -from company. In trying to charge it , used my USB-blackberry , but it wouldnt charge all the time, and when connected to my laptop, had funny suspicion needed my laptop On, came home still not charged so I was concerned it wasnt . Had them call me, she was empathetic, walked me thru the steps, click on link I got my adapter & extra USB cord, in case mine was defective, came yesterday, love that is charges quickly..Due to one never coming with package, she sent it to me under special promo.Yippy!!!She was VERY helpful..great experience with custoemr  service!!! Kudos!!!
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|my son enjoys this game but it gets pretty difficult for a 6 yr old good concept kind of interesting
B00BHMF578|4.0|Enjoyed it, very suspenseful and authentic. No details were lost in setting the scenario for the time period these events took place.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was fantastic.  It was a page turner and I never tired of reading it. When I finished reading it I reflected quite a bit on what it looks like when a seemingly mentally healthy person has a mental health break down that requires hospitalization and intensive psychotherapy.  I really enjoyed this book and I would like to see the movie.
B000J159N8|5.0|This is the most powerful, moving movie I can ever remember seeing!  I recommend it to anyone, for or against, our involvement in foreign lands.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The main character, Charlie, is an interesting teenager. As the narrator he positions himself as a social outcast and I spent most of the book trying to determine if his perspective of himself is accurate.  He meets great friends and has so many highs and lows as he navigates his first years of high school.  The ending surprised me.  I love this book and recommend it if you are looking for a thoughtful and interesting look into the life of young boy coming into his own.  I can't wait to see the movie.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a great show compared to much of what is available on tv  these days. It is a show that is entertaining and thought provoking.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I thought this book was a very fun beach read.  It was a bit outrageous and unbelievable at some points, but who cares it is entertaining.  I very much enjoyed it and was amazed at how many plot twists it had.  I would recommend it for a fun relaxing beach read.
B00338QENI|5.0|Oh my gosh, I absolutely loved this book.  The first 3/4 of the book was entraging to me as I followed this woman and her cells!  The bit towards the end got a little long but I still did learn SO much from this book.  I have recommended this book to my libraries (yes, I have several library cards!) my school library and to the science teachers at school.  Once you read this book you will see live in a completely different way.  Read it!
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I typically don't enjoy books that have elements of fantasy to them, however I did enjoy this book and its inclusion of fantasy and magic.  This story is about a traveling circus and magic.  The plot focuses on whether or not the magic is truly magic or more a fantastic optical illusion.  It is also a love story.  I really enjoyed this book.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|If you love mystery and Scandiavian authors you must read this series.  These are the books that got me hooked on Scandiavian authors and I was SO sorry to hear of Stieg Larsson's passing.  The books are raw, gritty, sometimes it can even make you uncomfortable but the author works his magic and sucks you in with every twist and turn.  This book is just as good if not better then the first one in the series.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Who'd of thought a bunch of stuffy english aristocrates would be a blast to watch. My wife heard about this show from her co-workers and we gave it a go. It is terrible how the season ended and we can't wait till season 4. Jolly good show!
B001NLKT60|5.0|If you love mystery and Scandiavian authors you must read this series.  These are the books that got me hooked on Scandiavian authors and I was SO sorry to hear of Stieg Larsson's passing.  The books are raw, gritty, sometimes it can even make you uncomfortable but the author works his magic and sucks you in with every twist and turn.  In this book I loved the why the author revealed the past of this complicated young girl.
B000084HAJ|2.0|San Marco is dark, the colours look like they're painted over the singers, the image is undefined. A pity, because the music is brilliant.
B0015DROBO|5.0|If you love mystery and Scandiavian authors you must read this series.  These are the books that got me hooked on Scandiavian authors and I was SO sorry to hear of Stieg Larsson's passing.  The books are raw, gritty, sometimes it can even make you uncomfortable but the author works his magic and sucks you in with every twist and turn.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Nothing beats the vintage original series episodes! The acting and classiness in TOS was something that is non existent in entertainment nowadays. Most importantly the music had swing and excitement! LIve long and prosper
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Fun, but I don't want to pay to get more lives. Just wait and g we t more lives. I'm addicted
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|Ending really surprised me. It took me sometime to get into this book, but after the first quarter I really got into it and could not put it down.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|OH MY GOSH! This movie is sooooooo amazingly awesome! ALEX PETTYFER IS SO GOOD LOOKING! If you love him you have to watch this movie
B0091QSNEE|5.0|LOVE DR. PANDA APPS!!!  Perfect for our kids and keeps them entertained and learning!  Worth the purchase!!  Get them all :)

B001DF68MA|3.0|My daughter is 2 years old, she weighs 29 lbs and is 37 inches tall. The seat was just very crowded and was not at all comfortable. I'm guessing it's because she's so tall for her age. For those who are buying for a tall toddler-- you might not want to get this specific bike seat. I had to return.
B003MC5N28|5.0|This book was meant for teenagers, but, like Harry Potter, an adult could enjoy this book.  Once I started it, I couldn't put it down.  But be wary, it has a very dark side.  I would not give it to anyone under twelve to read.
B0091REZMW|4.0|The game itself is fun. I have no plans to spend money on it, though. I do wish we could spend the in-game coins to buy diamonds, though. That would help those of us, who are playing for free, stretch our session playing time a bit.<br /><br />Some actual instructions would be nice,too. If there are any, I have yet to find them.<br /><br />edit: Well, I just discovered that you cannot add friends across platforms. That's a bit of a downer. I did see that there are FB communities for each platform, though, so that might prove to be helpful, somehow, if they can control the spammers.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|The fight scenes of Batman vs. Joker or Batman vs. Superman are epic in this film.<br />One will watch this movie over and over.<br />Hurry up, buy it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey has a hit on his hands. I literally could not put this down and read the whole thing in two days.
B0068FYZIO|5.0|Although based on true events, this movie was so heart-breaking, and at times difficult to watch. Every human being should see this!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Don't let kids play because the adults on facebook have no respect and don't edit their language or crude behavior even on a public site. I'm tired of my kids asking me about the new words the learn just trying to play bongo and no way to turn the commentary off!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|It won't load I keep pressing  the yes button but it just. Won't load I'm getting tired of it and might.<br />delete
B000068FY0|4.0|I was never a big fan of Supertramp, but I always liked the songs &#34;School&#34; and &#34;Bloody Well Right&#34;. I never really listened to the rest of the album before. This album has some great music on it. If you like supertramp this album is a must.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really do love to play it but it's not letting me upgrade to Rome:(<br />So I was wondering if anyone has a kindle fire HD can u tell me what to do so I can keep my fun going
B00475AYJQ|5.0|The best books take you away to another place. And this one did just that. I can't wait for the next one.
B002TXZRNQ|5.0|i'm really glad i bought it!<br />a lot of wisdom in this book. teach u things u might understand in ur older age, but with this book, u can understand them earlier,and its a good!
B0070YDOT8|1.0|I'm not sure what I expected from this  game. It wasn't what I expected at all.I guess it's my &#34;bad&#34; for not reading abput what I was buying before I made the final transaction.
B007N8RULO|1.0|I am used to a different version with clearer graphics.  I plan to delete the version and look for one with better graphics
0765325950|5.0|I'm soooo sorry Robert is gone, but I'm enjoying Sanderson's books now. I will reread the series in the near future, even though I know they outcome. I hope Sanderson will continue the sage with Jordan's families' blessing. It would be fun to see &#34;what happens next&#34; as the new world rises.
B008KZVNFS|1.0|I have a Panasonic Blu-ray player and this disc wouldn't play. Maybe because it came from the UK? Not sure what is going on.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Disregard the content and the fact that drugs are involved. This series is about people and what they have to do to survive. I have already laughed and shed tears because of the reality involved. I of course will buy the whole series. Everybody should watch it.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|You probably know if you like Dr. Who. I do so, 5 stars. Have fun watching these great David Tennant episodes.
B002QYUVY8|5.0|It was great! Hilarious and def worth watching. Unexpected thrilling story. The ending will surprise you and you sure will be laughing the whole time
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game is similar to the original in that it requires logic in deciding where to aim these crazy birds.  Some are more effective at certain situations than others.  What is frustrating about this game is that you always get the feeling that you can do better than you already did.  Sometimes that is not the case.  The saying &#34;quite while you are ahead&#34; comes to mind.  This, like the original, is great for all ages.  Warning!  It is addictive.  Take in moderation.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|Love this  game ,need more levels !!!! Make more games like this,please!!! So entertaining ,you don't have to spend extra money to play it .
0446554995|3.0|I swore I was not going to read this book after the Cold Vengeance disappointment, but I did. It was good, tied up all the loose ends, and sets up the next book. I won't be reading any further though. The style is completely different than the beginning of the series and I don't like it. I had to see how that story ended, plain and simple, and I think I'm done with these authors now.
B009XY97VC|4.0|I love TSFH's music.  I am a fan.  I own all their albums.  That makes me biased when I gush about how much I love their music.  Skyworld did not disappoint.  My only reason for not rating this 5-stars is there really weren't as many 'grab you by the gut' pieces as in some of their other albums, but they are still great.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Stargate SG-1 is one of my favorite show. I am currently watching Season 3 on Amazon Prime and will definitely be watching all 10 season. Each episode there is something different going on and I can't wait to watch the next episode.
B005A1ER0I|4.0|For TSFH fans, Thomas Bergersen's standalone piece contains a wider repertoire of sounds than the other TSFH albums, with a sprinkling of more vocals, some pieces with techno-sounds, a few softer pieces, and some that are just plain fun.  This is a genius being creative and sharing it with his fans and, as usual, there are no 'dogs.'  Although each is as different as a piece of chocolate in a sampler, they all fit together nicely.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I thought the beginning was slow going but once they were on the boat it picked up tremendously.  From that point on I found myself transformed to the sea with Pi.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Haven't read a book this good in a while.  The author did  a great job developing some unique characters in a though provoking universe.  Always been fascinated with the accessible doomsday device scenario.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this app but buying other horses is a lot of coins. I love horses so I love this amazing app.
B007PBKG5G|4.0|Even Baby Boomers can appreciate new groups that reflect their roots. This great new music brings back shades of Allman Brothers and Atlanta Rhythm Section with guitars that sound a little like Creedence Clearwater Revival. Good stuff.
B008IJTFYW|1.0|I thought that with all the stress that today's world brings so many of us, this app seemed like a God send. I guess I should have thought it seemed to good to be true because it was. It has simple boxes on the screen that you touch that play horrific sounds and even worse when you touch several buttons together. It does nothing but take up space.<br />AWFUL!!!<br />Regards,<br />~ Holley Jacobs
B009HUB40Y|5.0|addictive. and fun!  need more time.  I can play it night and all day. when does the paid version come out?
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I can't get enough of this show or the books, such a wonderful story with every aspect of entertainment imaginable.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|Rango is a marvelous spoof on western movies, done with amazingly evocative animation.  The plot comes from classic westerns, but populated with realistically animated talking animal critters, including the chameleon hero and the rattlesnake villain. A desert town values water above all, and that's what is kept in the town bank. But there's a severe shortage, and it may be deliberate. Rango bluffs his way to being appointed sheriff, and sets about getting to the bottom of the water crisis. There are echoes of the Jack Nicholson movie Chinatown, which wasn't about Chinatown at all, but about shady land developers. You'll hear lines that sound just like Clint Eastwood and John Wayne and all the dozens of colorful character actors that were in their westerns. There's even a young girl trying to hold on to her family's ranch in the face of villainous efforts to force her to sell out.<br /><br />The fantastic animation by Steven Spielberg's Industrial Light and Magic is the polar opposite of the South Park or Hannah-Barbera minimalist style.  The costumed animal critters have emotionally expressive faces and movements. In fact there is a whole raft of end credits to an &#34;emotions capture unit.&#34;<br /><br />This movie rings a lot of bells, because the story and the characters are a very funny spoof on classic westerns.  Amazon classifies it as &#34;for kids&#34; but I think a lot of it would be way over the heads of kids. There's plenty there for adults. My wife and I are &#34;senior citizens&#34; but we enjoyed it thoroughly, and we recommend it highly.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a great game for people who like a challange and like to have fun with anaimals then you are all set and ready to go.
B0063GORYU|5.0|free works for me - like the game and play it all the time - would recommend it to anyone
B005LAIIGC|5.0|I found this during a period when Amazon was offering it for around 50% off, and leapt at it. Granted, other retailers also sold this set, I was glat to pay the extra amount for same-day-shipping, to get it on release day. I love this movie, but the eggs will stay snuggly in their case.<br /><br />A great collectors item, and if the other movie Hotel Transylvania is anything to go by, then getting this set will be a good idea, as soon as possible, because it will become increasingly harder to find the BR/DVD/Digital Copy sets with Easter Eggs. Get it while you can.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|downloaded this and played it for the first time - lots of fun and kind of addictive - I think anyone would enjoy this game
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This has been a fun game to use, I have enjoyed it so very much. Thank you! I plan on playing this for a while yet.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I never miss an episode! Ever! On the edge of my seat & surprises at every turn. I love it!
B00138H876|5.0|I already own the vinyl and wanted to buy the MP3 so I can put it on CD and enjoy it in the car, etc.  I always found the songs on it very emotional.
0307700879|2.0|The book was fine.  What was not fine was that the type was so small I all but needed an microscope to read the book.  I probably did see that the book came from Everyman's Library, but perhaps not.  In any event, there was no notice to me that the type would be as small as it was.  I gave up reading the book about 1/3rd of the way through--I just could not deal with the tiny type face. I suggest to you that you provide prospective purchasers of books with tiny typeface with a statement that the typeface is very (in this case, very, very) small.<br /><br />Burt Carnahan
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very cool app. Today it shut off my kindle and my friend's kindle. Would not start the kindle again for several minutes. Batteries were good. Please fix. I love my horse :)
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|Am not going to write much about this movie, other than WATCH IT. Unless you are a fan of  Steven Segal-only movies, you will like it very much.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app will be used more than I thought. It is very easy to navigate for us older generation and easy to use.
B00BGIC4I6|3.0|I almost stopped watching the movie after the first 30 minutes. The plot was just all over the place. Then gradually it got better. It had its funny moments trying to describe what people (couples) go through when they turn 40+. Of course, way too many mishaps and issues for a single couple. In any case, it was entertaining. For me anyway. I am sure everyone who watches it will have another view.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|A VERY GOOD THRILLER. WE WERE SITTING ON THE EDGE OF OUR CHAIRS. BEN AFFLECK DID A OUT STANDING JOB
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|Loved the costumes, the story line and the action. If you liked The Lord of the Rings this will bring it all together!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The book was ok, but he could have done a much better job if he would have spent more time on the story line. He left a lot of holes through out the book! But I guess that is what you get fore $3.99, a half }#% story.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Thought the acting was great but I thought it was a very slow moving movie. I kept trying to fall asleep but managed to make it to the end.
B00BF124PC|4.0|A good movie that demonstrates how essential human intelligence in an age of sattlelites and drones. Good cast as well.
B008133MDK|3.0|I really like the portrayal of Watson.  And I like the Sherlock very much.  Perfect people for the characters.  The story line was not always clear.  It was an artsy movie, not a story.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|This book was a game changer for me.  In all my years of reading, watching, listening and yearning for peace and happiness, not that I'm necessarily unhappy,  I  discovered I had been looking in all the wrong places.  Mr. Tolle says if you're searching for happiness you're already headed in the wrong direction.  Enjoy the read, it's worth your time.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Obviously the story is true but it is told from a different perspective in my opinion.  I expected to see some glorified story of Seal Team 6 saving the day and killing OBL.  However, the story is mostly about the efforts of the CIA in finding OBL and then convincing those in power to go after him.  I thought it was an interesting take on what seems to most of us to be a one night mission.<br /><br />The story actually covers over 10 years of the hunt (done by CIA and others) and does not at all go into what Seal Team 6 did to hunt and prepare.  Movie did cover the mission in full.  Well acted, true story, very good movie.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I thought this was a wonderful read with the plot twisting and turning until the end at which time I thought,  I could write a better ending.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Watch it the other day, one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. I really felt like I was watching the real thing like I was there very powerful very moving I love every minuet of it. A must see for every american. I will see It again.
0375869026|5.0|Wonder is a wonderful book. Over the course of a month or so, we read it to our 5 year old, who loved it.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Very addictive game... my daughter and I loved this game!  The. Hints really helped and kept us guessing!  Awesome fun.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game works well on my kindle fire. It's a mix between realistic animals and fantasy animals. I love rescuing the different animals and you can make them dance and move. It's a great game. I recommend you getting it, it's worth it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This was amazing! A must see! I was able to watch it streaming on my Kindle fire with ease. Thought I could do it on Netflix, but learned that Amazon got the streaming rights first. So I cancelled my Netflix account and wstched it using my prime account!
B003R0MF1W|5.0|I really didn't want to like this show but find that the longer I watch it, the more I'm captivated by the characters, the story lines and the suspense. Third season is a must watch for latecomer fans!
B0091REZMW|4.0|good way to pass time. good graphics and game play. easy to use and works well on kindle. my kids love it.
B004M5HUXE|2.0|This book probably shocked most people when it was written but it is difficult to put oneself in the frame of mind of an earlier era. We know what we know. We've seen what we've seen and this is not radical. Parts of it are compelling; her enjoyment of sex, finally. But a huge amount of it is repetitive and depressing. It made me wonder how any of us get by in life, even in the best of circumstances; possessing lots of money, title, estate. It just seems like life is not worth the trouble for more than half of the book. It picks up but I almost put it down before there was any action.<br />I don't think I'd recommend it. It's painfully depressing to a large extent.
B00992CF6W|5.0|kids love this game so much it's hard to get them to do any thing else, great for road trips.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|great app, use to keep tracking a bid.great for price checking on the go.Would advise for retro game hunters or couponers.
B0015AARJI|2.0|It worked well until a week ago.  I returned from a trip abroad and found it had become completely nonfunctional.
B005LAIHQS|4.0|last of the mib and great deal and awsome copy. Got a great deal and would refer this to friends.
B002OR0RP0|2.0|My kids (6 & 4) watched this movie. They said that it was too scary and they didn't want to watch it again.
0670026603|5.0|My five star rating says it all - I LOVED this book. I was a little put off from reading it because a friend said that she found it incredibly depressing, but I was so happy once I delved in. The plot is very heavy, but Ms. Moyes does a great job making it palatable. I had several times when I laughed out loud. I also had times when I was sobbing, but it was a good balance. As an able bodied person, this story really opened my eyes to the many things I take for granted. The characters were all very well-drawn, though Patrick could have used a little more fleshing out. The dialogue was amazing, and felt very natural. I get that the topic is controversial, but the bottom line is that while some people are able to live very happy lives after suffering injuries that render them quadriplegics, not everyone can. I was struck by how perilous Will's health was and how many things could go wrong. I had always thought of being a quadriplegic in terms of the inability to move, and having to depend on others for everything. The potential for illness and how easily the scale tips was eye-opening for me. I cannot judge someone for not wanting to live that life, and yet I am so happy that people are able to live such a life happily and fully. I really think that it depends on the person. It was a very well written book, and I enjoyed taking Lou's journey with her. The love story was organic and rang true with me. The end broke my heart because I thought that Lou and Will could have continued happily on, but I also felt that credence had to be given to Will's view that it never would have been enough for him. I would highly recommend this book, even if you think that the storyline may be depressing. I was pleasantly surprised. If, however, you are the type of person who only likes to read happy, fluffy books with no substance that offer escapism, then do yourself a favor and stay away! This book does not deserve bad reviews just because some people only like to read happy books. Iam sure there are legitimate criticisms, but not that it makes you sad. Jojo Moyes has risen to the top of my must read authors list!
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|While the movie starts out kind of slow, it has an interesting and thought-provoking story line. Great allegory and visually lovely!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i think this is a great game its fun without the mess. I lived on a farm and took care of horses and that was just the best ever i loved this game. if u love animals get this game
B009GX69RK|5.0|A great new show that's kept the fun going through season 2.  You start with the adventures and storylines of 'It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia' along with a less cringe-worthy version of it's sense of humor.  Throw on a great group and pair dynamic filled with a healthy amount of sexual tension ala 'Friends'.  Next add the quirky characters with inside jokes and gem after gem of comedic genius akin to 'Seinfeld'.  Now scramble this all together and Walawala! you'll have New Girl.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|i like the this game a lot much better than the first one not very many nice games but i consider this one great
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|Although I watched it once and liked it, my husband watches it all the time and it keeps him occupied!
0553588486|1.0|I'm one of two people I know who didn't like this series, but I didn't like it at all, especially his treatment of the female characters.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|I was completely satisfied with this transasction.  We have enjoyed watching it several times already.  I will be on the look-out  for more of he same.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy the show as much as I did! I recommend to anyone I know, do it.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|The movie is very good, but Denzel Washington's performance turns Flight into great!!! I recommend this movie for mature teens and up!
B001F4UHFI|3.0|The movie was ok. Time dragged after a while.. . . . . . .. . . . . . .
1616550414|5.0|Great quality, timeline and explanation. Simply Awesome, every the legend of Zelda fan should have it.<br />You won't regret the purchase
B0055OK2T0|4.0|Not your typical love story or a chick flick. Keeps you glued to the screen. Surprising end. . . .
1935670913|4.0|Have reviewed all the chapters and am now in the process of reading the whole book.  It will be very helpful to me when I try to market my own golf manual.
B00BF123WG|5.0|The story of how they found Bin laden. The very last portion of the movie is the operation of how they killed him. Spoil alert only if you live under a rock.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|am getting addicted to the show. Intense drama. if you like police moves , you will love this show. the strike team seems to live on the edge
B00BHMETKC|5.0|But the movie was great! . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . .
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|As other reviewers have mentioned this play has nothing to do with the book but beautiful music and, hey, Keira is in it doing a brilliant job as usual. Overall a decent waste of a couple of hours
B00B9LNLTQ|3.0|I don't know if I'm being subconsciously subversive, but I really enjoyed the last two Strokes albums \\"First Impressions..\\" & \\"Angles\\".  These records are full of imaginative & well-crafted songs, which continues with \\"RCA\\", admittedly to a slightly lesser degree.<br />As stated in pervious reviews there is a big 1980's influence to the album, but what the Strokes have done is incorporate this musical style with their own, creating a pretty original sounding long player.<br />As I said early, the record is not entirely successful (hence the 3 stars), but I would sooner listen to band that are not afraid off pushing their musical boundaries & not quite producing a perfect album, than just treading water with every new release.<br /> The Strokes could have make a very successful carrier by recorded carbon-copies of their \\"Is this it\\" album, but continue to create adventurous rock albums.<br />Dreadful album cover though, I mean when Casablancas & co sat around discussing what to have, an analogue audio reel tape box was the best idea they could come up with!
B005HEPS6A|5.0|This is a great show and a easy way to watch it. I would highly recommend watching this show soon.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I enjoy the time period of this well written and well produced series. I could not wait for season 3 to come to Amazon Prime so I bought the DVD.
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|This is a great show and a easy way to watch it. I would highly recommend watching this show soon.
B006X5L6VS|5.0|Fun for me, and all the neighbors and all there kids. Can't wait for some hot summer nights to ck out the all nite sky.  Fun.
B005HEPOKU|5.0|This is a great show and a easy way to watch it. I would highly recommend watching this show soon.
B00B22IJXK|3.0|Having some trouble getting to know this one.  Its hard for me, but im not very artistic so maybe thats why.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was surprisingly super funny.  It has the perfect amount of drama and comedy; it's a feel good book with a serious story line.  I loved it.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Great read!  I was so sad for the story to end!  Loved the development of characters, enough description, but not too wordy.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Similar to Bejeweled. Lots of fun in the fire mode when your flaming diamond falls. You must work fast to a line your gems, so you can get your flaming diamond to the bottom.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|What I love about this show is there are no all-good or all-bad characters.  Lots of action to keep the Mr. happy, and I love the character development.  We plan to watch all the seasons.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Disappointed to finish this great read. Way better than the HBO series although that is good also. Just had to buy book 5.
B0083TXXZ4|4.0|make sure you plan to buy additional so kids is happy. looks incomplete w o it and too light but ok all inall
B004H6G0TI|3.0|its not my favorite game but then its not the best its just plain okay. Nothing more to say !
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|My 4 year old want me to play all the time. Has a couple of characters you might recognize. Sonic, Pacman, Qbert. Etc...
B004Y042N8|3.0|I like this game and my son does too but when the levels get harder it would be helpful to have some hints for solving the problem.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Nice to have the whole series in one download. Must read! Great deal for the price and you will not be disappointed!
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I love this game and the music.  My kids also love playing this game too, the easier levels are perfect for them.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|This was based on a true story.  It was real life at its best.  The surfing scenes were fantastic and the story very real (at least to me) and enjoyable to watch.  The best parts of human nature were displayed here.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I didn't realize it was teen story, but I liked it anyway.  Very interesting.  I loved the NEW-BFF character the best &#60;3
B00985E3UG|5.0|A &#34;must read&#34; for anyone that has the money to enjoy good eating habits. You shouldn't read this if you can't afford to reduce your intake of processed food.
B001IXSU8M|1.0|this download was for my daughter.. never really liked LG.  Nothing much more to write. Ugh, five more words to
B000000XCE|5.0|This is a great album. listenable all the way through. if you can find a good analog version LP (with no digital manipulations), I highly recommend it.
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|i FOUND THIS PRODUCT TO BE EXCELLENT. i plan to commence using its advice as soon as i can!<br /><br />i would recommend it to all of my friends and relatives
B003UCK262|5.0|No dogs on this album at all, with perhaps the \\"poor boy shuffle\\" being my least favorite. Analog LP's like this provide a three dimensional wall of sound that is warm even at loud decibels.
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|I downloaded this free app a few days ago and right away downloaded eight free kindle books. It's a nice source of free books.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|nice gameplay. difficulty gradual but not too very hard. nice graphics.  I was rather entertained with this game. I would recommend this game.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|It's another great Tim Burton film. Fun. He is so imaginative.His monsters are original and the dog is adorable. I recommend it.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|This movie was very good, it has something for everyone. I would recommend it to anyone! You should watch it!
0937381888|5.0|Good book to learn to brew.  The only complaint is it gets a little technical at times explainging things I dont reallly need to know.  Overall this is a good book to learn brewing.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My son jumps up and down when he knows we are watching wreck it Ralph, and with the 48 hr rental we were able to watch it 3 times!<br />It is such a wonderful movie that I didn't mind the encore :)
0060531053|5.0|This is a good book to start in the brewing hobby.  I will recommend buying other books along with it because things are not completely clear at times.  After getting How to Brew along with this book it made things clear.  If you already know how to brew this is a good book to add to your collection,
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Love this series. Very charming! Great casting typical British goodness. So refreshing to find this while there is nothing great on tv at the moment. Family friendly.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Just wow I'm so glad I decided to read this book I literally couldn't put it down I read it in less then 24 hours. Can't wait to start book 2
B00BTHV05M|5.0|Modern day U2-esque. Love it.  Some songs are so catchy it is hard to get them out of your head!  There are so many instruments / different sounds in each song it is truly beautiful music.  Plus, the best timing ever for the release date, on my birthday.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Second time reading the book, and I'm still holding on to every word as if it was the first time. Too hot to handle. Enjoy!
B008LC8TJI|5.0|I am now a fan of Maroon 5.  Thanks to the Voice I took a chance.  I love this cd!
B0050DZN4K|4.0|as a replacement for google reader, transition smooth, hope it retains usability over graphic appeal. Images load slowly, but i can blame my connection, not the service. Still learning all features, will test next in my Chromebook.
B00006878K|5.0|This CD has already cemented its pedigree in the american musical scene - irregardless to what I might say - this is a classic on every level, and in every way - from the band ( Booker T plus Dunn et al and Memphis horns)... this is a CD (music) that should be studied and analyzed by all students of the american music forms for its brevity, its impact, its arrangements, its pizzazz, its songs,. The CD release I have demonstrates it all - it sounds great, is inspiring, the playing/tone is strong, the arranements sparse and supportive without seemingly lacking (arrangement is often mistakenly misunderstood - some add too much - but not here), the sound is clear, concise and inspiring.  Plus, Albert could play, couldn't he?  In the welter of uninspiring, unimaginative and downright boring musical offerings that abound (to feed the industry machine), too often true inspiration and musicianship seem lost - not in this case, however....but anyone who listens to this CD already gets that - and without apology and/or any mental gyrations required to make a silk purse our of a sows ear...no pork products mar the day in this masterpiece.  I only wonder why and how it took me so long to get acquainted with this incredible effort.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|It's amazing that this man, Rodriguez, was unheard of in the U.S. until the documentary was released - what an great artist.
B001LIBRL6|5.0|I am very biased when it comes to Woody Allen generally and this movie in particular. I love them both. This movie comes from that period when Woody Allen was at the very top of his game. This movie, along with &#34;Love and Death&#34; rank very high as two of my all time favorite comedies. For me, watching the witty, neurotic fumblings of Allen in these two movies give me a chance to laugh at the similar qualities I exhibited in my younger days.<br /><br />I believe some people look at Allen a less than cool, less than glamorous screen figure, but that is a great part of the attraction of him in this role. And there are those who can't avoid being judgmental about his personal life. Well I say, set that aside for an hour or two and enjoy a very entertaining movie; a true comic classic. A lot of comedies are very funny for two-thirds or three-quarters of the movies. This one is funny and witty right up to the closing credits.

B00B69UQEO|5.0|I am a younger fan of Depeche Mode, since most of their best music came out before I was even born (1991). But as soon as I heard them for the first time I quickly became a fan of their technical mastery of rythm, synth and electronically charged choruses. Delta Machine is something of an acquired taste. It is, on one side, extremely different from their previous work but at the same time draws upon what makes their music and lyrics unique, and what makes us their fans. Upon first hearing it, it was like being lost in a new world, hence their first track \\"Welcome to My World\\". They tread the line between calm and energetic, lost and on point. It is a balance that shifts constantly and only Depeche Mode could pull it off so richly and perfectly. At the same time their are remnants of \\"Strange Love\\", \\"Personal Jesus\\" and \\"Policy of Truth\\" throughout the tracks, but no two tracks are the same, and no track attempts to repeat anything they've already done before. In my opinion, Delta Machine as a whole is on-par with Violator. I've heard it several times, and each time I hear it, I love it even more. Their album is not for listening, it is for getting lost in. You can transport yourself temporarily to this eerily beautiful paradoxical fantasy that is Delta Machine.<br />The album includes some very strong and catchy tracks such as \\"Sooth My Soul\\" and \\"Soft Touch\\", as well as brilliant tracks like \\"Should be Higher\\", \\"Welcome to My World\\" and \\"Secret to the End\\". There is a lot to love here. And the second CD has some very powerful tunes as well that are more reminiscent of Violator's more mysterious tracks.<br />Don't hesitate to get this album, it is rich and exactly what you can use to show off the most powerful headphones and speakers. Giver your ears the gift of perfect sound.
B0060D11OU|5.0|My kids love this movie i was surprised that my 2year old liked it so much that when she watches it she sings the song.this  an all around family movie we can all enjoy :)
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Highly recommended......Can't wait to order season 4 with you.  On time delivery...package was great...It is prefect for a night in to watch.<br /><br />Thank you
B000JMKNV0|2.0|This book was disjointed and the ending was unclear. It is an interesting story but poor character analysis. The ending will leaving you wondering, what happened here? I would not highly recommend this book.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I bought this movie mainly for the soundtrack.I think Adele has a fantastic voice.The movie was okay to view also.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|super fun. I love this game and if u get it u will like it too. why do people rate this so horribly sometimes. luv it luv it luv it luv it
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I enjoyed the music  because I loved the motion  picture. I also enjoyed the CD The Lord's Supper and Be Exalted.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|Got it because I was going to go to their concert, so I'd know who they are, listen to it because it is actually entertaining music :)
B008133MDK|5.0|I have watch Cumberbatch in other films and his acting is good.  I enjoy this series.  The British can produce some excellent dramas.
B004BEMC6G|5.0|It's a Bruce Willis film with a woman hero instead of a guy. Note, I didn't say 'heroine'. She outdoes any action hero I know of. The chases are quintessential chase stuff. It follows the standard path: truly effective agent is in trouble with bosses but does her stuff anyway. Jolie is exceptional as an action hero. Chiwitel Ejiofor is perfect as her nemesis/parther.<br />Don't miss it if you can.
B000I0GGSW|2.0|Not for those with sensitive ears to profanity. Old movie.  Language a little racy for me.  Enjoyed the plot and acting though.
B004UPAIDK|3.0|Obviously lots of intentional cheese here but only partly effective. Some good scenes and moments with some cool special effects.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|I do not care for this game because no thought or skill is involved in playing this game by yourself
B0091REZMW|4.0|So far the game seems pretty cool.It is a little more involved then I expected.It looks like a good game if you have the time.
B00082IJ08|5.0|This was everything that was promised, the CD was in great condition, no scratches, works well, case is lightly worn.  I'm quite happy with my purchase.
B006BTF2NO|5.0|This was a great CD! I was happy to get it. Ilove George Michael.I would recommend it to anyone who also enjoys his music!
B008KMHFJY|5.0|so happy this book got picked up for a movie, its awesome! not one boring part at all, cant wait for walking disaster!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|It's a tad bit scary at times, but our 3 yr old love the movie in the theaters and loves watching it at home now.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|the subject matter was hard for me, but it was written so well.  I powered thru... and am very glad I did.  I am an avid reader, I just recently started using a kindle .  I enjoy J Patterson's books, bcuz i am the avid reader- I look for good free or cheaper books.  In this books case the price did not reflect its content
B005LAIHY0|3.0|Standard Aliens movie. It was fun seeing the &#34;birth&#34; of the alien species, but the science in it was as awful as in the rest of the series.
B0012DP8A6|5.0|Another favorite movie for my daughter, she played one of the doo-op girls from the movie.  Happy to have been able to find it!
B00914JWSW|4.0|Some of the songs were a little disappointing, but all in all, it was a good album. Heard better from her, but i like it still, she can't do anything wrong really.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|All five! So loving and open. Really didn't want to put it down. Can't wait for the third. It's so exciting
B004JN1CW4|5.0|After getting through half of Maze Runner, I wasn't sure if I wanted to keep reading.  Now that I made it through all three books, I am glad I did.  Just like the second book, this book was better than the first.  This is hard to come by with trilogies (Hunger games trilogy for example).
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I loved watching season 2 of Downton Abbey!  The acting is wonderful and the scenery is breathtakingly beautiful.  I watched several episodes at a time- like a book I couldn't put down.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Great sequel to Maze Runner.  I liked this book better than the first.  Action packed from begining to end.  Keeps you in suspense throughout the whole book.  If you liked the first, you NEED to read this one.
B000KBCHRS|5.0|It is faithful to the original book, and whole family can enjoy it including my 9yo daughter. I watched many &#34;Jane Eyer&#34; movies, and liked the best of this acting part. Jane in this program enbodies the strengths, good faith, earnestness and tenderness that I felt from the book.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|I don't understand how this book got such high ratings?  This is a story about a highly destructive, disfunctional and abusive relationship between two college students.  There is nothing sexy about jealousy and emotional abuse.  This book sends a message that it's ok, even desirable, to be involved in a relationship with an emotionally unstable, violent man.  This books sends the wrong message to young women.  I wish I hadn't wasted my money on such trash.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|This cord works as expected. I have used the car charger now for more than two months with no problems.
B008XG1X18|5.0|All of those who are addicted to Facebook, or Twitter, this is in a way similar. For the crafty, crazy, and whatever you may call yourself, there is something on pinterest for you. And trust me, your not the only one. Lots of other people are on it liking pinning and doing the same tips that you are liking and pinning. It is a great for ALL ages! I highly recommend this to whatever kind of person you are. I have absolutely nothing to complain about.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent program ! Can't wait for next season....even with cast changes the writing is fantastic....LOVE Maggie Smith's character!! Makes me laugh out loud !
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun. Free games don't usually have this much to do. Faster if you by diamonds but if you are patient you don't have to spend extra money.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|I have been saying for years that Justin needed to make more music. I really didn't get into his music until FutureSex/LoveSounds...but I knew I found a new favorite from that point. It's been a super long wait and I'm very glad that he is sharing his talent with the world again.<br /><br />While there are only ten songs on the album, it's worth it for the length of the songs alone. I thought I wouldn't care for the songs too much due to the length of most of the songs but I feel like they make the songs better. And my favorite part in many of songs come in the last two or threee minutes so I'm happy there.<br /><br />I love love live the songs. Well, Let the Groove Get In leaves me wanting. But if 9/10 songs are loved, I call the album a success!! If you're a JT fan (heck, even if you're not), do yourself a favor and get this album. It's literally one of the best musical purchases I've made all year.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I quite liked this one! I think its the first cartoon I have seen with nudity in it though! At one point a bunch of the men use their pants to escape being trapped in a tower, and it shows them running off afterwards. So you see a bunch of butts. Not a huge deal, but yeah different.<br /><br />Merida is a great main character, her hair is insane. Her triplet brothers are hilarious as well. The Three Clan chiefs remind me of my friends and I couldn't stop laughing.
B000SLP4SE|4.0|not a very believable movie but the acting was done very well and some of the supporting actor did extremely well, some of the things that they come up with are scary.
B0049J3QF4|4.0|I find it somewhat annoying, but my boys love it, so yours likely will too. Toe Mater is a favorite.
B007T8BYWE|4.0|I have mixed feelings with many FlipPix games.  I am acquainted with this type of puzzle, and, normally, the solution looks like the object.  Here, you create a very generic shape which is then replaced by an image by the game.  It actually becomes easier as you increase the difficulty.  Quite a switch.
B0064X79JC|3.0|I saw the film before the book, guilty as charged. The film was majestically dark, elegantly offbeat, with beautiful cinematography and it had the best soundtrack of 2012. The only thing the movie has in common with the book are the name of the characters, a line of dialogue in the beginning of the book, an action sequence in the motel where the chick from AMC's Madmen dies, and the ending of the book; that's not a spoiler by any means, that's just something that fans of the movie should know right upfront. Driver (the character's \\"name\\") in this novel isn't the quiet, cool guy that Gosling played in the film; this Driver is talkative, witty, smart, sometimes even obnoxious. I actually prefer the Gosling counterpart, but that's me.<br /><br />Okay, so now let me talk about the book without comparing it to the movie. I think James Sallis was going for a Godfather-esque, noir story, but the plot was just so simplistic that the author had to scramble the scenes around like eggs; it wasn't necessarily hard to know if a scene took place in the past or present or future, but at the same, it wasn't necessary either. In fact, the first chapter in this novel was repeated in another chapter later on--word for word (or at least, almost word for word--because the narrative was repeating what had already happened in the beginning).<br /><br />I think Sallis tries to write like McCarthy, but he ends up sounding amateurish. He tends to miss words in sentences; for instance: Instead of, \\"The dog ran into the street to fetch the ball,\\" Sallis would write, \\"Dog ran into street to fetch ball\\"--some of that works, but Sallis overuses this writing method to shorten sentences . . . it was almost as if he was trying to get below a certain word count, so he deleted a lot of words.<br /><br />Another problem I had is that most of the characters talked the same way. The character's speech patterns actually missed words too (convenient, huh?).<br /><br />Ultimately Drive was a disappointment. I prefer Cormac McCarthy's prose, but I suppose he's impossible to compete with. I see potential in James Sallis's writing . . . but he needs to flesh out his paragraphs, flesh out his characters, flash out his plots, and write a story in chronological order instead of scrambled scenes.I prefer Cormac McCarthy's prose, but I suppose he's impossible to compete with.

B0084B5TK8|5.0|Vampires have come a long way since this text was written, but anyone claiming to know the creatures of the night needs to have this text in their arsenal.  This work contains the myths and legends that gave birth to all those blood-suckers that came later.  The writing fashion makes you feel as if you are seeing the secrets of the characters.  Awesome!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is amazing. defintely recommend it. I also love that it is prime, there are so many books that I would love to read but they are not prime so i cannot ge them. If i didn't ge i wouldnt have been able to write this wonderful review and i wouldn't have bought th movie...
B004FOA84A|3.0|My kids loved this game.  I thought it was ok, especially for a free game, but it seemed to be over far quicker than I liked.
0061733199|5.0|A very detailed book that is clearly written by a skilled SAS person.  If you can master all the techniques in this book you should be ready to survive an emergency.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This is a great game.  My kids are entertained trying to win, and it gets me through long layovers and flights with a laugh.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Skeptical at first but after the first chapter I couldn't put it down.  Good combination of love and mystery.  Keeps the reader wanting to know more.
B008JFUNPK|4.0|If The Croods has a familiar feel to it, it's because it deals with familiar themes - coming of age, fish-out-of-water experiences, confronting one's fears, and of course, the most familiar theme of all, family. That said, there's a lot to be said for the ways in which The Croods takes on these themes. The animation is beautifully done, the voice cast highly talented, and, unlike most other 3D films, the 3D is put to good use here, both of which should not be surprising when you consider that a lot of the same talent that made How To Train Your Dragon, one of the best 3D animated films ever made, was also behind the making of The Croods.<br /><br />Set somewhere in an imagined prehistoric past, the film starts with a pelt-wearing girl named Eep (engagingly voiced by Emma Stone), talking about her family of cave-dwellers living deep in a rocky canyon, who apparently survive by adhering to the strict rules of the head of the family, her over-protective, over-cautious and over-bearing father Grug (Nicolas Cage), the number one rule being 'Never leave the cave!' Back in their cave, Grug is telling a story to the rest of the family - wife Ugga (Catherine Keener), younger daughter Sandy (Randy Thom), son Thunk (Clark Duke), and mother-in-law (the inimitable Cloris Leachman) - using a prop that represents Eep and her curious nature. None too subtly, Grug uses his story - and the unfortunate prop - to warn the family that curiosity, exploration and 'new things' are all threats to their survival and therefore to be avoided at all costs. While the rest of the family are appropriately chastened by Grug's bluntly cautionary tale, it only irritates Eep who longs to see what lies beyond their cave.  And particularly above their cave, where a sliver of blue sky beckons. So when night comes and the rest of the family falls asleep, Eep decides to ignore her father's advice and she leaves the cave.<br /><br />While she's out exploring, Eep unexpectedly meets another another human, a caveboy named Guy (Ryan Reynolds) whose intelligence and adventurous nature are a refreshing change from her cautious risk-averse father. She becomes fascinated when Guy shows her fire for the first time and she immediately wants to learn more.  It also doesn't hurt that Guy is something of a prehistoric hottie who has also apparently invented fashion, aided by his pet/sidekick/accessory, a long-armed mini-sloth named Belt (voiced by Chris Sanders, who was also the voice for Stitch in Lilo & Stitch). Guy ends up telling Eep though about his belief that their world is reaching its 'end' and wants Eep to come with him, but Eep cannot forsake her family.  Before he leaves, Guy gives Eep a horn made from a conch shell which she can use to call him if she feels the need for help. Eep is then found by Grug who had been frantically searching for her, even though it meant leaving the safety and security of the cave. But just as they are returning home, an earthquake brings down the rock walls of the canyon they inhabit, destroying the cave.  Grug and the rest of the family are distraught, but Eep ventures to an opening in the rock walls that the earthquake has created, and there she discovers a new land just beyond, a land filled with lush brightly-colored vegetation and teeming with wildlife, at once beautiful and strange. And in some cases, it turns out, quite, quite dangerous.<br /><br />Venturing reluctantly into this new world, Grug and Eep and the others must learn how to survive in it. And later, when they meet up with Guy, Grug has the additional unwelcome challenge of dealing with the threat (to his authority, anyway) of a younger male whom his daughter is obviously attracted to but who stands for everything he deems dangerous and to be avoided.<br /><br />All of the characters are well done and distinctive, both in their look and in their voicing, but one of the things I particularly liked about the way Eep was drawn was that she actually has the kind of solid, athletic build it would take to engage in the kinds of activities she does - like climbing up rock walls unassisted. You have no trouble believing that she can do the things she does in the film.<br /><br />If, as some people have noted, the quality of the story-telling in The Croods tends to be uneven in places, I think this is due to the film's rather convoluted production history, which is worth relating here. Originally, back in 2005, the film was intended to be a stop-motion animation film to be produced by Aardman Animations as part of a deal with DreamWorks Animation, working from a screenplay by John Cleese (yes, that John Cleese) and Kirk DeMicco, based on a short story called \\"The Twits\\" by Roald Dahl. Cleese and DeMicco reworked the script to fit a film idea DreamWorks had about two cavemen on the run, one an inventor-type while the other was suspicious of anything new.  But Aardman dropped out of the project in 2007, with the rights to the film reverting to DreamWorks. Chris Sanders, the director of Lilo & Stitch, was brought in by DreamWorks to direct the film, and began making significant rewrites to the script.  But then in September 2008, Sanders took over directing How to Train Your Dragon, which resulted in The Croods being put on the back-burner and its release date pushed back a year. In May 2009, DeMicco was brought back on as co-director, but further delays results in the release date being pushed by yet another year.<br /><br />In the end, the story was something of a mixed result with Sanders and DeMicco as the primary influences. The best parts are clearly the work of Sanders, who not only wrote and directed both Lilo & Stitch and How to Train Your Dragon but also worked as writer on notable films like Mulan, The Lion King, Aladdin and Beauty & the Beast. DeMicco, on the other hand, has a somewhat less stellar record consisting of films like Space Chimps, Racing Stripes and Quest for Camelot.  All things considered, it's remarkable that The Croods turned out as well as it did.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who likes a good story with engaging characters coupled with well-done animation where the 3D actually adds something to the feel of the movie.hletic build it would take to engage in the kinds of activities she does - like climbing up rock walls unassisted.

B00BF11STU|5.0|Should have won Best Picture....saw Argo and it was good....this was great! Worth the rental and may need o watch more than once.
0452289963|1.0|not worth the read! don't waste your time reading it. not worth the read. a waste of time. I didn't like it at all.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Read it without stopping, awesome book! Grips your attention with suspense. I couldn't put it down until I was done with it!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I really like hidden object and word games. This game is new to me; however, I see some people are , OBSESSIVE, and LONGTIME players (some for as many as several YEARS! The various mode levels allow a pleasing combination of finding objects in different rooms or levels in the \\"manor\\"...matching items to shapes, their jumbled and unjumbled names, as well as in night and other modes. Rooms/levels require you earn \\"gold coins\\" and diamonds to buy in items needed to banish various demons and characters that at some level begin gliding across the screen. Items you buy or earn are parts of collections which are \\"charged\\" with special permissions into artifacts used in upper levels. I have seen people chatting online or blogging that they are level 100 and over! I do not plan on becoming addicted like that and do not like that at certain \\"low\\" levels, the game requires purchases of the diamonds to progress. Otherwise, free play is still available but PAINFULLY slow! Daily play earns level ups as a well as inviting others to play, gift, and trade collections with you. This game never ends! Many complaints are online about paying and not getting coins or diamonds they opted to buy instead of earn. Friends in the game are complaining about their linked relationships too. Anyway, basically, I like the game. It can be addictive, expensive, and challenging..a rare combination these days. Each weekend game codes are given by the makers (Game Insight) for free items or points, etc. During play, you can be rewarded with items, coins, and/or diamonds too for doing some tasks or events. All said and done...remember it's only a game. Be careful or you can possibly overspend when it comes to those diamonds!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Watch it! You won't be disappointed. From the first episode of the first season, you are hooked! It's terrifying, it has suspense, action, romance, just about everything! This show is most definitely the best I have ever seen, including movies! If you love zombies and gore, you'll love the Walking Dead.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  There is so much to learn about being positive.  We are not all the same and this book gives us opportunity to think about who is healthy and who is mentally ill.<br />Who is the healthy one in the Peoples family, certainly not the father, although his sanity is never questioned in words.  Very well written book which rises many questions and gives us hope.  I highly recommend this book.<br />I look forward to see the movie now when I have read the book.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|While Facebook is a great way to keep in touch with friends and family, it takes over your contacts and puts ads in your face. I have tried to delete contacts out of my contact list and facebook blocks it. They have no business in my private contact list. Also now there are constant suggested sites that are on my news feed page. I'd get off if it were not a handy way to keep in touch with friends.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed the book -- thought the ending was great -- everybody loves a happy ending!!!  Wish there was a fourth one......
B00872ARMO|5.0|First heard her sing on Graham Norton.  Lovely voice.  It's a shame we do not hear more singers like her.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Good follow up to the first Fifty Shades.  Once I began reading, I couldn't put it down... would definitely recommend.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I LOVED this book... to me this story was the darkest and edgiest of her novels, the story sucked me in completely. she is best known for Gone Girl, which I actually really liked too, but this one is my favorite... second is Dark Places then Gone Girl third.
0891419063|5.0|I bought this book for my grandson and he loved it.  His grandfather was in the Marines and he could relate to the stories his grandfather had been telling him.  Great read.
B0027MJU00|4.0|i love Gillian Flynn's writing, her characters are usually women with interesting pasts and the stories are dark and edgy... I loved this book, it's my second favorite of her novels, the first being Sharp Objects, and in third place is Gone Girl.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Once again Tom has come through with a great novel.  He makes you feel like you're right there with the Jack, John, Dom, Jack Jr., etc.
B008L5FFP6|5.0|Picked this CD up after seeing Young Guns on their current tour with 10 Years (just ended March of 2013).  Would never had bought the CD without seeing them live and I am so glad I did purchase it.  They put on a great show with high energy!  They carried that energy with them when they recorded this album.  It is an around great album that you can let play from start to finish.  Pick up the CD so you can sign along next time they are on tour in the states you won't be disappointed!
034580404X|4.0|Not the best written books I've read, but certainly entertaining escape fiction.  The plot improves with each book.  And my husband has enjoy the benefits. :)
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This is yet another triumph by Peter Jackson.  Lots of action and a great story.  I would recommend this for children over 10 though, as there are a lot of &#34;creepy&#34; characters.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is truly amazing, I have been hoping to find a good one for school and here it is! It is always working, there are no adds, and it solves the hardest math problems!
B00499NHLC|4.0|While I am not a fan of the many contemporary iterations of The Sherlock Holmes series, I recently found this series and to my surprise I was hooked. As a non-Brit, two things the British do well are Sherlock Holmes (I really like the Jeremy Brett series) and James Bond (and yes, Daniel Craig does one of the best portrayals). And they should STAY British!!!
B00BF11STU|5.0|I thought this was an excellent movie and this is a story that needs to be told. I'm not familiar with Jessica Chastain but her role as Maya was convincing and well played. I'm my opinion this was a much better and more credible movie than Argo.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|A little long in parts, but we enjoyed it.  I liked the way the lawyer was creative. good good good
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Great plot, great attention to detail, and he dumbed the technocrat stuff down so I could understand it.  Very funny.  Thoughtful, well designed.
B00340LM8C|5.0|Let's see, a Hitchcock movie starring Cary Grant and Grace Kelly that won an Oscar for cinematography, set in the French Riviera...what's not to love? It has some great old cars, including a '53 Sunbeam-Talbot Alpine roadster driven by Kelly's character, the suspense you would expect from Hitchcock, and while predictable in some ways, a fun plot. My teenage boys also enjoyed this movie.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a pretty good hidden object game. Lots of quests to complete and different. rooms to unlock but not very challenging. Some rooms you only need to find 4 or5 items to complete the room and they are too easy to find.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Totally worth the 2.56$. It is a great game that can just pass time. Exactly what I wanted. Levels not too hard but some challenging ones.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Perhaps one of the best books I have ever read! I would suggest this book to all of my friends.
B00AYE8C70|1.0|Someone I know uses this and suggested it. I tried to use this to communcate with my wife over WiFi. She also tried loading in on her S3. Mine loaded then locked up my phone for over 30 minutes &#34;syncing contacts&#34;. When it finally gave me back my phone it seems to be OK, Althought I was distress to find out that it seems to have uploaded my contacts to their server. I know this because the person who suggested it told me the next day that my contact on her phone changed to Viper active status. When I then went to use it there was an error and said it needed redowning loading. I tried three times with the same result. When my wife loaded it, it locked her phone so bad she had to kill it.  She had to un-install it to stop it. I also had to un-install it on my phone.
B0091REZMW|4.0|If yo jade into solving mysterys and like a detective game, then this is a game for you. I am only 13 years old and I love this game!! it is a 4 star rate for me. MUST TRY!
B0018PH3L0|5.0|It came like it was supposed to but I have not had time to watch it yet.  It looks good.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it's so fun I am so addicted to this game  there is so much to do.
B00B2TUKI0|3.0|I love madeleine peyroux's voice and music; this cd does not make the cut for a favorite.  I don't find myself playing it very often - I go back to her others.
B006O2QNOU|3.0|Good in that it kept my attention and was worth the time I spent watching it. Could have been better with a bit more character and story development.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|This game is a ton of fun! I'm addicted lol. I have so many games it's not often one keeps my attention and gets me hooked. Please make more or more area's!
B00000J7S8|5.0|This one is the best.<br />It is better than the other Album &#34;All for You&#34;. The CD record quality is good too.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|Easy to mount.  Only one suggestion for mounting to desktop.  Mount the desktop holes an equal distance from your viewing center.  It will make leveling the LCDs easier.
0385738781|5.0|This trilogy ended with a bang. It was a bit hookey but it tied up everything and what more can a reader ask? I will happily share this trilogy with friends. Well written with just enough mystery to keep you hooked.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Love it! Was perfect for what I was looking for! Exactly what I wanted! a e i o u and sometimes y
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This game is a kids favorite but you have to have a lot of patience to earn rewards or you have to buy them.  So this game can start to get pretty expensive - if you want to purchase the items you need to play it immediately.
1401211909|1.0|This is the ONLY time I have ever said I enjoyed the movie more than the book. Don't waste your money, buy the movie instead.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|to the point! it makes adding easy especially when your in the store getting store items easy and easy to use
B009DH2PP4|5.0|This book breaks homebrewing down into simple steps that fit nicely with a low budget startup cost for getting off the ground. You also learn nuances of different styles, processes and ingredients required for each. Great read!
0439882826|5.0|It's a Star Wars Pop-Up book.  What more can I say?<br /><br />I bought four, three for my friends and one for me.  The light-up sabers on the last page are just a bonus; the book itself is so incredible, they're hardly necessary.  Every page is filled with vibrant colors and insane details.  And many of the pop-up pockets unfold to have more pop-ups!  We got Pop-Ups on Pop-Ups in here!<br /><br />Seriously, too cool.  Great for any Star Wars enthusiast you know (which should be everyone you know.)
B0080XN3C6|5.0|Listen to &#34;Settle Down&#34;, what a voice! Very clean recording. You can hear every nuance and detail. As a whole the album doesn't have any &#34;fill&#34;, all the songs are original and her voice beautiful to listen to. Also the video for one of her live performances shows her great versatility to operate a sampler attached to her mic stand to generate her own harmonies as she sings, without missing a beat.
B002ITWSUQ|5.0|I really love this movie. Great story! And I love the cast. I think it is a great movie for all ages.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun its a great way to pass some time. like the quests added along the way and the challenges. good times remember the original?
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Book three of the hunger games is excellent! It's another roller coaster ride that can't be put down. Even at the end you have no idea how the last page will turn out. Finally,a book that ends just as well as it began! I highly recommend the entire series!
B000LTAY1U|3.0|I'd been looking for a quality automatic at an affordable price for a long while and much of what I was reading on the forums said the Seiko kept good time and took a moderate level of shock w/o any loss in time keeping. In my experience so far this is true, however it's major detraction is it's small digits and terrible iridescence.<br />Obviously, since it's face is rather small, there's a lot crammed on the face of the time piece, and while I'm more than aware of what time the hands' placement infer, the minutes vs hrs read doesn't do me any favors.<br />The night hand glow doesn't really glow. Mind you, I've been spoiled by my Luminox, but the SNK805's luminescence retention reminds me of glow in the dark stickers when you were a kid: hit it with a flashlight for 2 minutes and you get a solid glow for 15 mins. If the watch hasn't seen direct light for 20 mins you can't see a thing - and that's a problem if it's night.
B008AYA7WE|2.0|The bottom commands are partially hidden and hard to use.  Don't know how to make it work better.  Otherwise, it's OK.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It is a great book. I loved it, and how it is great ending to Katniss's problems. All in all, it's great!
B000PC0S5K|5.0|Expands beyond Power of Now with more depth of the power and perspective of living in the present.<br />The enlightenment of both books has transformed my capacity to live without hurt from the shortfall of daily humanity.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|Wreck it Ralph seems more like an early Pixar movie than a Disney movie. This makes sense, as John Lasseter, one of the early gurus at Pixar was executive producer.<br />In some ways, it covers the same ground as Toy Story, as the characters are performers who have a secret life once the arcade closes. Ralph is tired of being overshadowed by Fix-it-Felix Jr, the star of the game, and goes to win a medal in another game. It ends up with cast members from several games all converging in one for a cliffhanger ending.<br />Could give a long review, but if you like Toy Story or Monster's Inc, you'll like Wreck it Ralph.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Is a good book, I haven't finish it yet....the way E L James writes is very explicit...wow!!!...planning to read the trilogy
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|Love all the excitement about what would happen next. Time travelling is getting bit confused sometimes, but overall love it.
B002R2B6NE|2.0|It had an interesting plot, but suspense was merely moderate. I found too many implausible moments to really embrace this movie.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|I would like to see more pro American films  This helped during hospital stay.  It took me to another world.
B005SCSL56|5.0|I remembered my childhood really.  I am about 25 years old but  when I read this book I was not bored. I liked it so much. It mentioned the stories of our childhood. but shows an eye from outside and mix all the stories as if they were all in same place and in the same time. I really advice esp children to read this book.
B006X415GK|5.0|This was part 2 of my gift to my niece who collects Monster High dolls. Love the black and white look to this doll.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|A very interesting read involving memory loss and the fight to understanding who you are and who to believe. Sometimes it was a little repetitive, but that's sort of a given, considering the plot and main character's disability. I loved the twist at the end though! I had to stop mid-read and give my husband a brief summary of what I'd been reading about just so I could share the thrilling climax with him! I wasn't a fan of how much bad language was involved, though. Excessive.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Easily comparable to best spy-action intrigue novelists of this generation.  Moved at fast pace, held my attention throughout.  Highly recommend.
0988178532|5.0|I admit, I am not much of a reader unless it's a technical manual or something. A friend of mine recommended \\"outview\\" by author Brandt Legg. I was skeptical because my attention span has maybe a five minute window.<br /><br />Instead of turning on the TV a couple weeks ago I sat back on the couch and started on the first page. An hour went by of reading, then another hour and before you know it I was HOOKED! This book opens up a world of exploration. Yes, it's a thriller but for me it's more of a mystical journey.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Well I liked it ok but when I opened it up today it erased all of my progress.I was at level 43 then it went back to level 1. I even had all of the elements found and I had 4 unlocked but now I'm back to ground 1. It is very irritating.
0062238868|4.0|Very interesting if a bit simplistic. I went through it quite quickly as Mr Kyle (may he RIP) has a truly amazing story.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I read the entire trilogy in about four days, which is lightning fast for me. I literally couldn't put it down. I absolutely loved everything about it. Don't just see the movie! Read this!!!
B005V2S7FW|5.0|One of the best products I have used.  I load it on every computer where there is a need to remember, but the memory isn't that great!
B004QX07G4|5.0|I love Ellen. This was a super cute and super funny book. I enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Been a fan since the first episode of season one. Season two was a little slow, but season three definitely picks up the pace. Can't wait for season four!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I've been playing this game for a while and have not had to put forth any real money either.. graphics are amazing and you level up fast.. you do use diamonds to unlock things through out the game but you are able to gain them as you level up. Over all it is a great game
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Well another book I thought would frustrate me enough to put it down .. But I couldn't. Maybe it's the compelling character of Tom or the hope of some exposition ?  It's all still up in the air. Hopefully there will be some resolution in book 3
B003L77G2Y|5.0|Great Show! I like buying the dvds so I can watch one after another! I love all the episodes. Looking forward to the next season to watch.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I've had this book on my kindle since Christmas and I just read it and absolutely loved it. It was sweet and very easy to get into
B002TXZSLM|5.0|Mitch Albom delivers another brilliant read, the fact that it is a true tale only adds to his versatility and capacity as a masterful writer. His capacity to delve deep into reality, to articulate the World's beauty and to capture his readers' heart and soul from the first chapter through to the final pages is classic Albom. This book makes you think, laugh, cry and be deeply moved and carries all the hallmarks of what has become my favorite writer. Thank you Mitch for your capacity for storytelling and the love that you build within your chapters.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|I've heard great things about this movie since it came out. I decided to rent it.<br />Quite simply one of the best animated movies I've ever seen.<br />Santa, Jack Frost, The Tooth Fairy, The Sand Man and The Easter Bunny take on their arch nemesis The Boogie Man.<br />Some of the best fx I've ever seen bar none.<br />A brilliant but simple story line.<br />I liked it so much I ordered the 3d version and I CAN'T wait to see the 3d on my tv.<br />An amazing movie and a must see.<br />Recommended.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This DVD is everything they promise. Jillian Michaels allows no slack during her workout and you really feel your muscles getting stronger.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This one is right up there with my favs. It twists and turns and is so NOT predictable. Great, entertaining book.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I wish he would write faster so I could start reading the next book after finishing this one.  Excellent read.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Nice little chick lit, fairly predictable plot but still a fun quick read. It is Geared toward younger women, I think.
B00846F1YW|5.0|My kids and I both loved this app. Great job and we had great fun playing it. A++ Looking forward to the next one.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Works just as good as my phone and computer except the sound is seriously messed up.  It sounds like there is a constant echo.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|Other reviewers have written of the multitude of characters in this book. Reading this one directly after its predecessor helped me understand who they were, but following (in this book) all the children of most of the characters in the first book was still a difficult exercise, and as a result I became less involved in each individual's story. But that is the only weakness of an otherwise beautiful, harrowing, heart-filling account of the Second World War that I will recommend to everyone I know. I know too little of this chapter of history, dominated by war films that generally do not describe almost every part of the period nearly as well as this book. If you want to experience life through the war, both in distant settings and the front line, this book is the best I can suggest.

B001BZRUR4|5.0|I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a quick entertaining original novel. Wonderful character development, original storyline that keeps you guessing throughout. Type of read that makes you look at yourself and how you would handle the situations that the main character is dealing with. Grabs you at the beginning and keeps you enthralled through each chapter. One of those reads that will stay with you and keep you contemplating life, if you let it. Zusak also wrote the Book Thief, which is even better than this novel. I look forward to reading more of his works. Enjoy!

The movie has all of the good and not so good characteristics that are in the reviews of this version that is all over the internet reviews. My opinion is 'decide for yourself'. I loved it.

B005LAIH2W|5.0|This movie seems faithful to the late 1800's era of Sci Fi. I don't know why this movie didn't get high ratings; this was great storytelling ! You can see ideas were stolen by Lucas and used in his Star Wars movies. John Carter was ahead of them all. Give it a chance, you won't be disappointed.

I can do a two handed play at times but being old and arthritic in the thumbs makes it a bit more difficult.<br />Keeper.

B004S3MB2U|5.0|I've needed a calculator type app for my Kindle HD and this is the ONE! There are quite a few layouts for various functions that I won't use but. . . 1. numbers are sufficiently large. 2. the key sound is good when pressed so know you've activated that number. 3. the memory functions match other calculators I've used so makes it easy with little learning curve.<br />Now those of you that have need for scientific calculating or other iterations of a calculator might be able to use this one also. The capability of finding the versions is easy.<br />Developers did a great job here - for me.

B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book is a revelation about how we became a nation who valued people's personalities more than their character. It puts introverted people in a different and positive light. The world needs both extroverted and introverted people. I loved reading about my own personality and came away feeling very positive about it. If you are or know an introvert and feel like the world just passes them by because they are &#34;shy&#34;, this is the book for you. You will walk away feeling empowered by the strengths of being quiet when others find socializing and &#34;selling&#34; themselves so easy. A great, well researched and well written book.

B007REV4T8|3.0|It took James Bond fifty years to find Brokeback Mountain; but it was done in a gentle way... with a spiritual touch of Cary Grant, Danny Kaye, and Sir Lawrence Olivier, however...<br /><br />THE PLOT STINKS! POOR LOGIC! The writers have watched way too many Jason Statham Cranks. Bad guy's girl a misstep. A lost opportunity.<br /><br />Hence, this is a putdown of Her Majesty's precious Secret Service! Maybe the climb up Brokeback got the movie crew off track?<br /><br />On the plus side: Marvelous Adele! Perfect song! Best James Bond singer ever!<br /><br />And, nifty action sections, with just a few surprises. My favorite Miss Moneypenny of all times and the new Q was a brilliant step up.<br /><br />I would not be surprised if Ian Fleming might have had some issues with the development of this story.<br /><br />The purpose of James Bond is meant to be esoterically grand! And nothing less.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|Wonderful movie to watch as the effects are completely delightful!  There is a lot of \\"create your own religion\\" in it- also referred to as \\"spirituality\\".  It is a great journey well told.  I love the ending ( Bruce Willis is dead) (oh- sorry- wrong movie- but loved this one nonetheless). Also- my 8 year old really enjoyed it.  A little scary at times for younger children but not horrible if you divert attention.
B008OLO7ME|3.0|Bought this bag in early January 2013. After about one month of daily use, the natural fiber started to deteriorate next to the shoulder strap.<br /><br />The metal buckles are not extensible, making it difficult to strap them if you overstuff the bag.<br /><br />I wish I had ordered the Boa courier instead of the Mamba courier because of the wear issue.<br /><br />Otherwise, the bag is very well-built.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|The story is OK; the gorgeous cinematography and special effects were stunning and well worth my time and money.  In all, it made for a beautiful and unique movie experience.<br /><br />With my moderate hearing impairment, I would have been most grateful for closed captioning on my Sony Bravia smart TV.  How about it, Amazon?
0671449028|5.0|We love Sandra Boynton books, but this happens to be our absolute favorite.  My 2-year-old daughter and I have read this book over and over.  We especially love the ending: The moon is high, the sea is deep, we rock and rock and rock to sleep.  Simple and beautiful.  It's easy for her to turn the pages herself.  A fun last book to read right before bed.
034580404X|1.0|Nothing special in this book.  The sex is a little more kinky.  The story is poorly written.  I guess the sex sells it.

B00BHU9DUK|1.0|Blah...not worth your time.  You won't believe how unattractive Jude Law is in this film.  This film is very obsessed with creating a metaphor about theatre/life being a stage.  The metaphor overwhelms the entire film and distracts from its emotional heart.
B000K7VHJQ|4.0|The Passion of the Christ(released Feb/04)stars,among others,Jim Caviezel as Jesus Christ,Maia Morgenstern as Mary,Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene,and Rosalinda Celentano as Satan.It is certainly a passionate movie,in and of itself,and it was Mel Gibson's own personal passion to bring this part of Jesus's life to the screen.One may dicker and debate the esthetics and the manner in which Gibson portrayed His final hours,but there is no denying the emotion this movie creates within each viewer as each filmic minute passes by.<br />The story begins as the leaders of the Jewish Temple in Sanhedrin have sent guards to arrest Jesus in Gethsemane.Jesus is there and confronting temptation straight from the Devil himself.He is dragged and beaten all the way back and brought before the temple leaders and assorted citizens.Some leaders leave in disgust while the others that remain sentence Jesus,for his heresy,to death.The Romans get wind of what is blowing and inform their leader Pilate.Inevitably Jesus is brought before him and he must decide His fate.Pilate obfuscates and sends him to King Herrod for judgement,since Jesus is a Galilean.Herrod meets Jesus but in the end refuses to intervene and Jesus makes the trek back to Pilate.With many attending citizenry and Jewish leaders present,Pilate is put on the spot.Pilate decides to scourge Jesus instead of kill him.Jesus is brutally whipped and his handlers almost kill him until Pilate's second in command intervenes.In this state Jesus is again brought out with another convicted criminal called Barabbas.Pilate asks which one should he set free? They answer Barabbas,and much to his delight Barabbas is set free amongst the crowd.That leaves Jesus,and what to do with him? Pilate is forced into a corner and has no choice but to condemn Jesus to death,by crucifixion.Jesus is forced to carry his own crucifix and it is a brutal and terrifyingly wretched long walk to a mount outside the city.He is hounded every step by his Roman guards,who before the march started,gave Jesus his crown of thorns.<br />We watch as Jesus is tied and nailed to the cross and it is raised up into place.On lookers,including Mary Magdalene,his mother Mary and his brother,watch as Jesus slowly but surely slips into unconsciousness and death.The sky darkens,a wind storm and earth tremors follow.The film ends as Jesus is resurrected and the stone blocking the cave rolls away from the entrance.<br />I found it to be an emotionally draining experience.Gibson portrays each punch,each spit,each nail driven into flesh,each metal tipped whip and on and on,with startling realism.He wanted you to see and imagine just how much Jesus suffered for all of us and exactly what he died for.There is no movie before or since that has portrayed Jesus's final hours in such a graphic manner,and I doubt if there ever will be.Gibson set such a high bar here that it is,for all intents and purposes,out of everyone's reach.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.This version is the newer two disc set which has the recut version on it.Extras abound and are too numerous to fully mention,but include everything from commentary to a myriad of featurettes.This is everything you wanted to know about the Passion and then some.<br />You can debate the religious implications and even the reality of what you see here all you want,but there is no denying its impact.Gibson funded this epic himself and in the process created a one of kind film,in ANY genre.Highly recommended.4 1/2 stars.ds,who before the march started,gave Jesus his crown of thorns.<br />We watch as Jesus is tied and nailed to the cross and it is raised up into place.On lookers,including Mary Magdalene,his mother Mary and his brother,watch as Jesus slowly but surely slips into unconsciousness and death.The sky darkens,a wind storm and earth tremors follow.The film ends as Jesus is resurrected and the stone blocking the cave rolls away from the entrance.<br />I found it to be an emotionally draining experience.Gibson portrays each punch,each spit,each nail driven into flesh,each metal tipped whip and on and on,with startling realism.He wanted you to see and imagine just how much Jesus suffered for all of us and exactly what he died for.There is no movie before or since that has portrayed Jesus's final hours in such a graphic manner,and I doubt if there ever will be.Gibson set such a high bar here that it is,for all intents and purposes,out of everyone's reach.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.This version is the newer two disc set which has the recut version on it.Extras abound and are too numerous to fully mention,but include everything from commentary to a myriad of featurettes.This is everything you wanted to know about the Passion and then some.<br />You can debate the religious implications and even the reality of what you see here all you want,but there is no denying its impact.Gibson funded this epic himself and in the process created a one of kind film,in ANY genre.Highly recommended.4 1/2 stars.

B00383ZTXO|4.0|Loud, Rude and crude, \\"Raw Power\\" was Iggy and The Stooges at the aggressive best. If any album could be called the birth of punk rock, this is one of the finalists for that decree. Pushed into the maximum volume in this remix by Iggy himself, everything pummels like a series of body blows. It also includes the Stooges' classics \\"Gimme Danger\\" and \\"Search and Destroy.\\" David Bowie had made it his personal mission to save the band (they were without a record deal at the time and were having personnel problems), so he carted the entire crew over to England to record \\"Raw Power.\\"<br /><br />The title is apt. The Stooges flail away at hard rockers like \\"Your Pretty Face is Going to Hell\\" and \\"Search and Destroy\\" while finessing the psychedelic songs like \\"Penetration\\" or the mix-up of \\"Gimme Danger.\\" The real hero is Iggy himself, wailing away like a man possessed. Yet at the same time, he bellows under control of his yowling and howling, bringing \\"Raw Power\\" a finesse that the other Stooges albums lacked. Not for the faint of heart or folks who run away from distorted guitars turned up to 11, \\"Raw Power\\" is the most explosive of The Stooges' original trio of albums.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|this is a really fun game :) you can unlock new fluffies and tracks. you can also buy new carts dependjng on what level/track you are on.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Tina is funny in the book, I enjoyed it and I liked her style. I love to read non-fiction books so this one met my expectations, however, I think someone in the industry would enjoy it a lot more and for that matter understand it a lot more. it's not that it is hard to understand, but for those not in comedy or the tv industry sometimes it's hard to relate. Overall entertaining.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book with a great storyline. I first downloaded the sample on my Kindle and then downloaded the entire book as soon as I finished reading the sample. This is not the first Nicholas Sparks book I've read. He couldn't write a bad book if he tried.

B0094K1WZE|4.0|Even though I don't care for Tom Cruise, this movie was very entertaining<br />Might even watch it again good movie
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I enjoyed the ingenuity of the movie.  Loved how they wove the stories of the arcade characters together.  I witnessed the evolution of arcade games throughout the 80's and enjoyed how the history of gaming was depicted in the movie.<br /><br />Sarah Silverman, John C. Riley and Jane Lynch were wonderful as the voices of the main characters.<br /><br />As a parent I have suffered through some awful movies, but this is one which touched my heart and made me laugh.<br /><br />Finally, I love the meeting of bad guys anonymous and their resounding motto: &#34;We're bad, and that's good!&#34;
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I read the book after seeing the movie.  I really enjoyed the movie and hoped the book would be more.  The movie followed the book closely but for whatever reason I felt the book lacked the depth that I was looking for.

B000MD9UJC|3.0|I bought it primarily for the end cap.  The L.E.D works quite well as it is much brighter than the original Mini-Mag bulbs that came with it the flashlight.  The L.E.D  is not near as bright as the TerraLUX TLE-5EX MiniStar 2 Extreme LED which I bought at the same time.  The Nite Ize  is considerably larger LED than the TerraLux, and I plan on replacing the Nite-Ize in the near future.
B006T5C5PS|5.0|If you or someone you know has been diagnosed with cancer or a chronic disease like diabetes II, M.S., chronic fatigue syndrome, heart disease, etc, then you should look at this book before trying chemotherapy or any body altering surgery.  I just wish I had known about this back in the 1990's for my friend who died of cancer after her chemo treatments and my friend who also died from cancer a few years ago after undergoing chemo and dialysis, cause I would have encouraged them to try Gerson therapy first, and they would both be around today chances are! I am an R.N. and this therapy makes so much sense!
B00BUI6D2A|3.0|I give this album 3 stars because it is a Lil Wayne album. His flow is tight and his lyrics are funny. He's never taken himself seriously and neither should we. He puts out music that he likes and hopefully we like it too. That's the best you can ask from an artist. I don't want an artist catering to me.<br /><br />This album has some amazing beats and some good songs. Yes most of the album is about sex, drug use, money and other sorted details. But don't forget the old saying \\"Write what you know\\". He's been in the game so long that those things are all he know. Just remember that.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very fun and addicting game anyone can play it. Its very easy and I love it!!!!!!! I hope you will enjoy this game to.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|great history lesson but a little slow for me but i would recommend it to my friends because it is an academy award movie.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I had this game on PC and enjoyed it a lot. Saw it for droid and grabbed it. Plays excellent on my K Fire
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My husband and I throughly enjoyed the whole 3 seasons and I wanted to have the collection. We defeinitely would enjoy watching it all over again. All the characters are so good and the actors who play them. Recommend it for any age group
B000FBFN1U|2.0|I've read the first two books and feel the same. I kept thinking that the brutality throughout the story just couldn't get any worse. But it does. I'm no novice to brutality in literature, but George obviously needs help.
B000JLPMPS|5.0|This movie is great.  I bought it for my bf as he has been looking for this movie for several years now every time we are Wal-mart.  I finally went on Amazon and gave it to him for Christmas.  We have watched it numerous times now.  The story line is great and the actors are absolutely some of the best!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Brave had adventure, action and humor.  Great story plot. Girls could relate to her plight, but it's a movie for all ages.  Loved it!
0345529057|5.0|I'm so glad I bought the books because they are so different from the show after you get past the first book.  I started watching Game of Thrones on HBO, got so into it that I HAD to check out the books.  They are just as incredible.  The books differ from the series on HBO, but I'm not sure how much, as the HBO series has only finished the second season.  I'm so excited to finish the book series.
B00354YA4U|2.0|the book takes a really long time to get to the main episode, but once that happens, it's all very rushed..
B009IJJB8G|5.0|I could watch each episode again and again. Sherlock and Watson are extraordinarily unique. There could be no better choice of actors to play these characters. At least in my honest opinion. I love the fact that the producers put out a solid foundation for this series. Week after week continuous quality.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is the perfect game for horse lovers, and an excellent way to waste time :) It is sort of dumb, but it's also addicting in a way.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This is one of my favorite game for the kindle fire  the graphics are good the story is good it's just that the driving controls are hard  but if you get past that the game is awesome
1603420398|5.0|I got this for my sister, she started crocheting hats she from picures on the internet.  So haveing paterns of Motifs she can add some fun shapes to the scarfs and hats she crochtes.  The patterns are easy to follow.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|Seemed frenetic and crazy in parts but then was inspiring.<br />I am looking forward to trying some of the concepts.
B004H6G0TI|3.0|This game was a lot of fun.  I didn’t have much success shooting down the birds or the planes, but I loved making the plane fly loop-d-loops.  I also loved flying the plane up toward the stratosphere and outer space (you could tell you are getting too high when the light fades and the sky darkens) and dropping straight down to force a stall.  Once in a stall I would see how close I could get to the ground (and crashing) before I pulled up.  Fun.<br /><br />But while it was fun I had some issues.  My biggest complaint about this game was the placement of the dial that controlled the plane’s movements.  It was on the left side of the screen, and there was no option to switch it to the right.  As a right handed person I found this cumbersome.  I blame my lack of shooting precision on the placement of the dial and not on my horrible hand-eye coordination.<br /><br />I also had issues with the “sensitivity” settings.  I varied it from lowest to highest and I didn’t notice much of a difference.  It seemed to be stuck on super-sensitive where any little movement of my thumb would send the plane into loops.<br /><br />In playing this game I found that there wasn’t enough horizontal space to maneuver in.  I could only fly horizontal for a few seconds before I reached the end of the screen and had to turn around.  I was playing on a 7” Kindle so maybe this isn’t an issue on larger devices.<br /><br />So a game with lots of potential, but I wouldn’t try it again until the dial to control movement could be place on the right.
B001JIFYSA|4.0|I love these kind of movies. When you have nothing else to do its a great movie to watch over
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Great historical movie.Gave viewer a lot of unknown facts and details about Lincoln. Lewis deserved academy award for his portrayal of Lincoln.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is my go to game - helps me pass the time when I'm waiting.  Also good for relaxing after a hard morning of stress.
B004UPALT6|3.0|I appreciate the satire and the silly reverence the film shows to past horror flicks. It's a little dated and that's not really the movie's fault but it did hinder my experience. A great recommendation for horror and cinematic junkies but for others, you might be rolling your eyes more than laughing.
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|Being a frequent traveller, I am constantly downloading movies for my plane trips. I downloaded this gem wanting something a bit whimsical and fun. I absolutely loved it! I am in my 40's and would recommend this to any other adult as well as their children. I now understand why it got such rave reviews when it was int he theaters. Definitely a great watch!
159562015X|5.0|I took this for the first time myself a few years ago, and have found it incredibly valuable at work and at home (my husband took it at the same time). I found the assessment to be accurate, and I trust the validity and the reliability of the Gallup organization.<br /><br />I gave this as a gift to my 67-year old mother who loves surveys like this but also runs a home business and looks for all the ways she can help others in her day-to-day life. Lots of applications, in my view, for teens through older adults.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is a great way to just chill out.  If there is noise near you; this app allows you mask it with pleasing sounds. It's peaceful and it is enjoyable to create a calm relaxing environment so one can rest.
B005T9ZTSU|1.0|Endless loops of login, &quot;download the app!&quot;.  I downloaded the damn app and it STILL forces me to answer the download question, then puts me back to the login page.  I have never successfully logged in and now I'm uninstalling this junk.  If I'd paid for this I'd be really angry, instead I'm just frustrated.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Fab app,use it every day. Easy to use and control usage of kindle to optimise battery life.<br />Recommend this,five stars.
B00AEQYM6S|1.0|There is no doubting Kaufmann is a fine singer. My issue here is with the recording. The tenor is very closely miked (you can see just how closely on a promotional video)and the resultant sound of his voice (as remarked on by another reviewer) is metallic. Worse, however, is the relative volume of his sound compared to the orchestra, which is completely unbelievable. The soloist is massive-sounding compared to the orchestra. Now, this is a recording, and not a live experience, so one expects a slightly artificial balance, which is fine. This, however, is too much. If you turn up the volume so that the orchestra has some presence to their sound, then the tenor is way too loud. I found I just couldn't listen to this, no matter the quality of the singing, and gave the CD away.
B005K17RU0|5.0|better than running to the computer for the radar reports.  You can make the picture cover a larger area too.
B00AJLHUWQ|5.0|If you have heard Riverside before then buy this CD you will not be disappointed. If you are new to Riverside, this is a wonderful jumping off point.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|many good games you can play and there are awesome games a lot of people will love the game ifbthey download it
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I thought it would more advanced, but it's similar to bejeweled; both very repetitive.  When I'm in a waiting room or stuck waiting for a train to pass by, it prevents boredom, but not much excitement.
B009RH9J7W|5.0|This cover is better than any I could find in the store. Glad I ordered it! Price was good too!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|If you love Facebook, then you'll love this app.  It's the same thing, same set up..etc.  Just looks like a mini computer screen.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|The details in this book leave you absolutely breathless.  I am so grateful to God that He spared Marcus and allowed him to tell this story.  This is what the true warrior's spirit looks like. Thank you all so much, you who courageously serve and maintain true Patriotism.  Thank you for counteracting this vile liberal media that poisons our homes these days just by being who you are and doing what you are called to do.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I would really recommend this book. It is extremely funny. You never know what's coming next. All ages to! Get this book now with the rest of the series.

B00AHTYI5M|3.0|It was interesting and suspenseful but it was not the year's best movie.  Lincoln was much better.  It was better than Zero dark thirty.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I am spending great moments!!!!!!! I LOVE THIS GAME I love the graphics. Amazing colors. I especially love the hot air balloon Don't think buy this game!!!!!!!!!
B0049IHX2C|5.0|I could watch repeats of this movie. Of course I like the actors and subject in it too. Thank you for an engaging movie.
B000BRBA8S|4.0|Let me state upfront that I have not seen the two (loosely) related previous movies by writer-director Wong Kar-wai that precede this movie. I was recently browsing the foreign movie section of my local library and when I saw this, I couldn't resist picking it up. Glad I did.<br /><br />\\"2046\\" (2004 release from Hong Kong; 129 min.) brings a number of seperate story arcs that are being played out in a non-traditional manner and at times in a non-chronological sequence. The central figure in the story is a man named Chow. Chow has conceived of a world in which people can travel to the year 2046 to recapture lost lives and find loved ones. Few return from 2046. Chow is also seen interacting with various women in a hotel in Hong Kong, in 1966-67. He is particularly fixated on room 2046, which seems to house a subsequent number of mysterious (and attractive) women. To tell you much more about the plot, such as it is, would be to ruin your viewing experiecen, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br /><br />Several comments: first and foremost: if you think or expect this is a sci-fi movie, by all means, dave yourself the trouble, as there are just a few traces of sci-fi, and the rest of human relationship obervations (set in tle late 1960s no less). Second, this is complex movie viewing, due to the several story arc, but ultimately very rewarding. Third, the movie soundtrack is simply outstanding, with original music from composer Shigeru Umebayashi supplemented by a smorgasbord of 1960s music includig songs from Connie Francis, Dean Martin, Nat King Cole, etc. Just superb. Bottom line, this movie is not for anyone in a hurry, but if you are in the mood for a top-notch quality foreign movie that is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, \\"2046\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B0091WUZJE|5.0|Loved it when it first came out and still do.  One of the better ones Wayne did.  It is filmed in Monument Valley which is nothing like anything in Texas, but that takes nothing away from the film.
B008Y5OW20|4.0|Let me admit upfront that I bascially grew up with Electric Light Orchestra as a teenager in Belgium in the 1970s. But as much as I enjoyed ELO, their demise in the 1980s was logical. It was great seeing Jeff Lynne carrying on in so many different capacities. Along the way Lynne relased one solo album (1990's \\"Armchair Theatre\\") anow finally comes the second proper slolo album (please note that I am discounting the very strange and unnecessary release from last Fall called \\"Mr. Blue Sky: The Very Best of ELO\\", which indeed is a Lynn solo album as well, recording ELO classics by himself for no particular reason really).<br /><br />\\"Long Wave\\" (11 tracks; 27 min.) is Jeff Lynne's loving look back to the songs thah he heard on long wave radio growing up back in Birmingham, England in the 1950s and 60s. Things start off with \\"She\\", and immediately the luscious ELO-sound of yesteryear comes to the front, and what a welcome return it is. The Everly Brothers' \\"So Sad\\" sounds almost as good as the original. Don Covay's \\"Mercy, Mercy\\" is one of the harder-charging songs on here. Lynne lovingly brings fellow Traveling Wilbury Roy Orbinson's \\"Running Scared\\". Somehow Charlie Chaplin's \\"Smile\\" found its way onto Lynne's radar screen. Chuck Berry's \\"Let It Rock\\" is reminiscent of ELO's \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\", just great. \\"Love Is a Many Splendored\\" is another great semi-rocker.<br /><br />In all, this is a very nice album, in particular for us babyboomers, bringing the best of both worlds (the standards AND Jeff Lynne). My only complaint is that at just over 27 min., this plays like an EP rather than a full album (but of course it sells at a full album's price). That aside, I really hope that it won't take another 22 years for Lynne to release another solo album We're not getting any younger, you know (and neither is Jeff)! Meanwhile, \\"Long Wave\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B003Y5H4Y8|4.0|Very well acted. Keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. The surprise ending is very unexpected!
B004R1164C|5.0|Very entertaining movie which kept my attention and generated the tension and edge of seat excitement you would want in this kind of movie. Excellent acting by Russell Crowe.

B00AVASSZ8|5.0|Found Jose James a few years back tooling around Amazon MP3 downloads, and I was a fan right from the get go.  Of his voice and renditions but also his accompanying musicians.  Whenever MLK's birthday comes around, we always, and you should, also, bring out the best ever tribute song to the late, great Rev. Martin Luther King, \\"THE DREAMER\\" as done by Jose et al. This cut will awe you with it's beauty and love and respect and just good music.  \\"Winter Wind is another great cut off the \\"Dreamer\\" album.  So glad to see Jose has this new material out, and can't wait to check it all out.
B001993Y3G|3.0|Honestly, I should have read  the description more closely, it's just that I've never had an extended version on a dvd without the original version included as well.  If you're looking for more of the movie, please don't bother with this dvd.  The few scenes that were added should (and was) cut from the theatrical version.  Not only that, but the description on the dvd should have read that this was the full screen version (if you're thinking it's blue ray so it should automatically be the widescreen version you'd be mistaken).  I loved the original movie a lot and was looking forward to a bit more of it. Unfortunately, this version was below expectations.  Since this dvd doesn't provide the original version I will be looking to buy one that does and in widescreen.  Oh well, lesson learned.
B0031R5K68|4.0|Again, Dan Brown wrote a masterpiece. Not as much facts as in his previous books but again he manages to create another way to see things...

B008HT4FUW|5.0|Downton Abbey is a great show that shows the lives of everyone who lives there, regardless of their station, and how they must adapt as the world changes.  What I especially love is that there are snippets of humor scattered throught the episodes.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book was the best I ever read the plot and characters were well-written and the story line was womderful
B00846WWVM|4.0|If is fun to play during down times.  Car trips home from places my children take turns playing this game.
B005WBBYXO|5.0|The series is remarkable and having them all in one book is great and the extra content is also just really fun
B008K8U13K|2.0|The kids like it because it is fast, but the controls are touchy and I had to reinstall it because of a glitch.  It's still a bit glitchy.
B006TJXZ30|3.0|have not used Hotmail much on the Kindle Fire...On the desktop at home I like the sorting (junk and contacts) don't like to have to enter user name and pswd each time
B00B2DSIAI|4.0|The story line for the movie was good, the humor was fairly innocent and the retro game characters were cool. It was a cute movie and my daughters really enjoyed watching it.
B005K17RU0|4.0|like being able to check several locations as I have family in other parts of the country.  nice to have it on the Kindle
B005DJGMQE|5.0|I watched this as a Prime Instant Download/View.  Good emotional movie.  Not too sure of many of the facts put forward in the movie to simply justify that Mary Surratt was a by-stander and not a participant.  She was more interested in protecting her son than fighting for their lost cause.  Hmmm.  For a reasonable person to believe she had &#34;no&#34; knowledge of the conspiracy is pretty shallow.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book was definitely one I had difficulty putting down. Not thrilled with the ending. I recommend it to anyone looking for an escape.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This is absolutely fabulous! It keeps you guessing to the very end. It has so many twisted details<br />that pull you in and never let go.

B004XUMMFE|5.0|It still amazes me that this series didn't take off.  The writing was great, the cast were wonderful, the chemistry is there... Joss Whedon did a fabulous job of putting this together. I wish there had been more episodes.

B005LAIIFS|5.0|I watched this with my grandkids and we all loved it. The kids were engrossed the whole way through. Loved the Easter bunny, he made me laugh a lot. =)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|As desperate and heart throbbing the book is at the beginning, it evolves into a romance so deep an passionate that not any evil can overcome. Throughout the novel, you are constantly waiting and in of the dreadful arrival of Kevin. I loved the book and all of the questions that are posed throughout including the mysterious background of the characters. I could not put it down and finished it in a few days!
B008220C38|3.0|I have always loved this story, but was disappointed with this one. I don't know if it was the way they staged it or what. Just made it seem a bit hacked up to me, and had to force myself to sit through it. If I want to see a play I'll go to a play.
B00AK0X5VQ|1.0|There were no instructions so I had no idea what to do.I did get rid of some circles ad that was it.
B007REV4T8|3.0|The special effects were excellent.  It is a typical Bond movie as he always  wins and to my surprise killed of &#34;M&#34;.  The next movie will have the new &#34;M&#34; and the new Q, just a kid makes the computer wizard appear real.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|After reading The mistborn saga, I was hungry for more Sanderson. The way of kings introduces a truly amazing world with magic and creatures I have not seen in any other fantasy setting. This is probably one of my top five fantasy books of all time.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|This book led me in a direction I wasn't expecting but I really enjoyed the ride.  It really made me think.
B007REV4YI|4.0|Skyfall arrived promptly and was in perfect condition.  The movie was up to &#34;Bond Standards&#34; We watched it right away when it arrived and were not disappointed.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Loved the characters the author created.  I can't decide if I like the different perspectives but maybe it was because I liked Lou's so much.  I usually don't like books that can get a little weepy but this one made me think and I didn't feel too manipulated.
B001YV5068|4.0|I won't provide my opinions of the movie or give a long winded summary of the plot.  My reviews only refer to the quality of the transfer to Blu Ray from the initial Standard Definition release which I have.  This will not be a comparison between the two though.<br /><br />The video transfer to blu ray appears to be completely free of any artifacting or banding.  It is a clean transfer with no hint of disturbing grain or aliasing either.  That said, it does appear to have had its color grading adjusted by crushing the blacks.  Therefore, you do lose some of the details in the darker areas.  Skin colors and other color resolutions appear natural and warm in most scenes.  There were a few scenes that had a cooler color grading, particularly in the rooms where the hostages are held. The Blu Ray played normally without any problems at all.<br /><br />The Audio transfer is to a lossless DTS MA 5.1 and it sounds perfectly clear with precisely balanced volumes for both dialogue and ambience.  During the first hour and a half, there is very little use of any of the surround channels and almost everything is coming through your center channel.  When the imagined shootout and police raid on the bank occurs, all of a sudden the audio comes to life with a great deal of directional steering making use of your surrounds, both front and rear, for discreet channeling.  Your LFE channel, at this point, also wakes up for the duration of these scenes.<br /><br />The extras included deleted scenes that, if included, would have made this sometimes ploddingly slow film, even more so.  Usually I prefer deleted scenes to be included in an extended cut but not for this film.  There was also a typical trailer and a discussion between Denzel and Spike that appeared to be more glad handing nonsense than any in depth exploration of the movie.<br /><br />All in all, a good clean transfer to Blu Ray.  Would you see a night and day difference between it and the Standard Def?  Not really though because of the boosted Mbps rate which varied between the mid teens and low thirties you would find a greater contrast where there is contrast and truer colors and that might make it worth it depending upon the type of monitor you are using.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so hope they can assist you as well.<br />I do hope this brief review of the Blu Ray's transfer of The Blind Side has been of some help to you in determining your purchase.<br />Thanksause of the boosted Mbps rate which varied between the mid teens and low thirties you would find a greater contrast where there is contrast and truer colors and that might make it worth it depending upon the type of monitor you are using.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so hope they can assist you as well.<br />I do hope this brief review of the Blu Ray's transfer of The Blind Side has been of some help to you in determining your purchase.<br />Thanks

B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome but skins are a problem because you can't get them but if you download (aptoide) on your device get pocket tool and if you want to make your own skin get skin creator too then on pocket edition tap tool kit then tap skin/texture then change you skin after long taping the skin and press apply changes but when you get on Mcpe it says unarthurized request then download mcpe launcher pro and tap on that go into 3rd person and boom there you go

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I have NEVER read the same book twice, but I am highly anticipating the release of Walking Disaster and wanted everything to be fresh in my mind. I re-read this book in a day (again) and I didn't think it would be possible for a book to bring so much emotion to me the 2nd time around, but it sure did. I absolutely loved the characters in this book. They made me cry, scream, laugh and cry some more. Jamie McGuire has made me a fan for life.
B00BI5IXL4|4.0|When I saw this movie I had never seen any version of Les Miserables or heard its music.  I really enjoyed the visuals which were stunning in some scenes but were obviously CGI in others.  The music was outstanding.  I found Hugh Jackman's singing to be a little distracting but still good.  I loved that they sang the songs live because it doesn't look fake like with other musical movies where the singer produces amazing range with little effort.  I also enjoyed the emotion displayed in the singing, especially in Anne Hathaway 's rendition of &#34;I dreamed a dream&#34;.  The only reason I did not give this movie 5 stars is that it feels long.  This movie is long but some movies that are long don't feel long but for some reason this feels long.  I do not get bored with the movie but the enjoyment of the music does not overcome the feeling of the movie dragging a little.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys musicals, music, and television shows like Smash and Glee.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|The videos can be viewed with closed captions usually on the second day after they become available (two days after airing). The sound quality is great, definition is easy on the eyes, and is definitely worth the $1.89. Thank you, CW and Amazon!
0316187216|5.0|Ever since I purchased 'The Blade Itself' (first in a trilogy) I've been hooked on the character creations of Joe Abercrombie. They jump from the page at you, and their circumstances whether unfortunate (mostly) or not, are always realised with a descriptive power that puts one right in their shoes. This book is what I'd call his third 'spin off' after 'Best Served Cold, and 'The Heroes.' I'm already fascinated by the character of 'Lamb' (I've only just started) and if any one reading this review is an Abercrombie aficionado, then I think you'll agree his identity clues foreshadow a very bloody comeback.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a wonderful book and series.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys to read.  Great read
B003B02O14|4.0|With The Partner, John Grisham rolls out yet another cadre of interesting characters whose dynamic presence helps drive the story. But this one; oh boy, this one has a twist you will not expect. A most enjoyable read!
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|already i see that people r saying they only get 15-20 minutes. so i dont think it would be a good game.
B001O3B2M2|5.0|always have and always will love this cd. So Inspiring and uplifting, specially to women. she has such a beautiful and soulful voice!
1595141979|5.0|I can't wait to re-read this book! Love each and every one of them! Richelle Mead is by far one of the best authors
B008L1DNGI|5.0|didn't know if my 8 yr old granddaughter would like this but she caught right on and plays it on my Kindle. Now her mother needs it on her phone.
0345529057|5.0|They are way more better than the series for me. I'm from Chile and I had no problems with the arrival of them.
B006QS0PF0|4.0|I personally adore reading memoirs and this book was no exception. She made herself very vulnerable in discussing this incredibly shameful, scary, and embarrassing illness. I can see how writing this memoir was healing for her.<br /><br />However, please handle with care. This book could be very triggering for anyone suffering from an eating disorder.
B008220DIC|3.0|I really looked forward to viewing this movie - I mean how can you loose: Philip Seymour Hoffman, Joaquin Phoenix, Amy Adams? Wrong! The movie started strong (great actors, presumably a great story - NOT). I was hooked for about an hour or so, then the movie just ended. I'm not an expert but I am a fan and know this movie fell from potentially great to crap in the last 20 minutes.<br /><br />I really feel I wasted my money on this one.
0307891372|5.0|This book is so excellent, I was not expecting as much information as I got from it, I've often found myself caught up in just reading it even when I'm not playing Skyrim.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|It had an interesting story and a clear plot.  The performers had good diction so it was easy to understand them without straining.  Tommy Lee Jones delivered an outstanding performance (as usual).  The whole show was believable, in spite of ghosts,  and never boring.
1440503257|5.0|As a 20 year old Harry Potter fanatic (and I say that proudly), I have to say this is an excellent book. Many people have commented on the lack of pictures and to that I say, from a fan's point of view, I was not at all disappointed by this. Fans of Harry Potter don't want authentic looking books with plain pictures in them, we want moving photos to look at. Due to the fact that Ms. Bucholz is not a witch, we can all understand why this was not feasible. Also, I do respect that some of the Brits who have written reviews were a bit irritated to find that many of the recipes that were supposed to be magical for them were rather ordinary (such as the steak and kidney pie). However, for many of us Americans, these are not regular dishes and while we may not wake up in the morning thinking \\"I want some authentic British steak and kidney pie\\", we might wake up and decide, \\"I want to scarf down some Steak and Kidney pie like Ron Weasley\\". I loved the way the recipes were anchored in when they were mentioned in the books. I also loved some of the creative liberties the author took in deciding certain recipes for foods not explicitly explained in the book, such as the four scrumptious cakes Harry received for his birthday. This book was a fun read, looks great on your cookbook shelf OR your Harry Potter fan shelf (I know I have one), and I'd recommend it to everyone who has a little magic in them.
B004J4WKTW|2.0|I am not much of a fan of surrealism, but read this book, a selection for our monthly book club meeting, not knowing what I was getting into.  I found the switching back and forth in time difficult to follow.  I guess I just didn't get the point of the whole story!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love it! It is great and so much fun! I love all the different free puzzles I can download!
B00BR9W8JE|5.0|The book I enjoyed immensely like I do in this genre and Vince Flynn is one of the best, this order is a gift.  The seller, Vision Sellers, re-delivered &#34;The Last Man&#34; and responded to my emails in short order and resolved my issue with all the concern,aplomb  and efficiency one expects in a vendor that desires repeat business.  They make the effort and get results.  Flynn plus Easter equals joy for me and hopefully for you as well.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|As usual, Adobe Reader is an essential program to have, whether it is on my computer or my Kindle!  Can;t live without it!  Glad that it is free.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|works good i will buy  from you again great products  super great buy  . . . . . . .
B007FC3AAI|5.0|I loved the ending to this series!  There were such great special effects that made the battle so real.  I feel the actors and actresses have really grown in their ability to bring the characters to life, compared to the first movie.  Great job!
B0064MGU98|5.0|Love the character of the lead woman.  Good to see how she copes with challenging situations.  Keeps bringing me back for more.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|Visually lovely film-I avoided it for a while because I did not think the very internal dialog Pi had going would translate well at all. The visual beauty filled in a lot of the shortcomings of the story. I felt the script did not do justice to Pi's realizations at the end...but I am glad I watched it-as usual the BOOK is better :)
B009VYF5E2|5.0|I love the Merlin series and this will help me have the DVD and watch it when I want to.  Thank you.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|This game  is great for everyone! My boyfriend and kids all love it and can't stop playing it. They like the challenge of making things. I'd recommend this game for everyone
B008M0NDOK|3.0|I bought it with my sisters account with prime ,came today works well. Comes with a pouch and the stand as seen in the pictures of the product. I find this great for first person shooter games. How ever I'm VERY upset I bought it for 33 now its 14.98 I would have saved $18 for something else I'm saving up for. I give the controller a 8 out of 10 because they need to make most if not all game loft games compatible with it. If you have any questions or concerns about buying this product leave a comment down below I will reply asap!
B001AGNRYO|5.0|Nick Drake, with his gentle strumming and melancholy hum, efficaciously takes you to a place deep within yourself, dark, safe and instantly pleasant.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This appn is amazing! It's so dependable, so I never have to worry about it not going off when I need it. They have multiple settings that make it interesting. You can even adjust the light, and you can set nap time alarms. Over all, it's a great tool to have.
B000091NII|5.0|Any music fan must own this album and more specifically, own it on vinyl. Vinyl quality truly does The Talking Heads' music justice.
B0094K1PW4|5.0|It has all the eliments of a good movie. Good acting, good story line, and directed by someone who knows how to direct.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I saw Le Miserable on Broadway and did not like it. The movie changed my mind because it allowed me to understand the story and theme. I loved the music, the story and the acting. It was very emotional and I will definitely will see it over and over again.
B001MLEW2S|4.0|This movie is very good, and i am surprised about the negative comments. I mean considering the time it was made in 72 it is not going to look how movies do today, because they didnt have that technology back then to work with. I was very pleased with it and it kept my attention throughout. If you are looking for a good revenge movie with some gore then this is for u. I highly recommend this film. Wes did great on this being his first movie and all.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I have bought both the 1st and 2nd Seasons and have watched with complete enjoyment. I do not have and HBO subscription so I can not see Season 3. I have also listened to the books in my car with audio.com  Absolutely a great book and series.
B004WMKSH2|1.0|Very inappropriate for a Kid that has follow the whole saga! Disturbing scenes for a child and even for my self.
0399160450|2.0|Threat Vector has a strong premise, one that is certainly plausible given the viruses, worms, and sundry other problems we encounter daily in our techno world. I am also a Jack Ryan fan and was thrilled with his reelection in the previous Clancy thriller. However, I assumed incorrectly that I'd see much more of President Ryan than we actually do in Threat Vector. The Jack Ryan in this newest novel seems a pale shadow of his former self. Although the Ryan Doctrine is still in force, this charater's dialogue,tone,and actions seem stiff and unnatural, not the Jack Ryan developed so carefully beginning in Hunt for Red October. Unfortunately, that is true of most of the characters in this novel. Jack Jr. is still stiff and impersonal. The older characters of Clark and Chavez are at once pale versions of their former selves and caricatures of those personalities. Some mellowing of these characters should be expected, but mellow is not the same as dead or plastic!<br /><br />More important, however, is that the novel does not meet the standards Clancy set for himself in his early works. The language is often stilted. Characters speak not only in complete sentences but also without using slang (except for some jargon here and there related either to technology or spycraft) or contractions. Somehow I can't imagine Ding or John Jr. speaking this way except in the most formal of situations, certainly not when they're  sitting around the conference table debating the next actions the Campus should take to quell the various plots running through this weighty tome.<br /><br />Given the number of book franchises Clancy  is currently running, I can understand his use of ghosts or co-authors to meet deadlines. But when any company fails to ensure the quality of its product when it subcontracts its production, that company loses business. Mr. Clancy, you've lost me as a reader. I no longer really care about the characters and won't waste another few days of my life reading professional copy that is no better than that of many of the junior high students I taught.

B006GECE9Y|4.0|The browser runs reasonably fast on my Nexus 7 tablet. I value it highly because it a great addition to Evernote.<br /><br />I recommend it for fellow Evernote users.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I think it bears mentioning that the world (and the USA in particular) had a whole decade in which to get even more jaded and cynical than it already was when the last LOTR film was released, so I was expecting a culture that might be a bit more indifferent to the wondrous, exquisite first film in Jackson's 'Hobbit' trilogy. I was correct, but pay no attention to the world. This film is as astounding and as full of authentic Tolkien spirit as any of the LOTR classics, more than able to shift gears to accommodate the completely different (but obviously interrelated) story of Bilbo's unique adventure. Just as Tolkien's 'Hobbit' was child-like and spare due to its narration by a simple Hobbit, there is necessarily a more buoyant, child-like spirit to this film (if one must compare it to the LOTR set), but it's hardly spare and do not think for a moment that it lacks the gravitas, creativity, whimsy, and inspiration of the other films. Many of our old heroes return, and some new ones are born. McKellan still thrills as lovably crusty Gandalf, wise beyond thought. Blanchett is more radiant than ever in her Galadriel cameo. The dwarves are outstanding to the last, with Thorin Oakenshield becoming a complex and worthy hero to rival Aragorn in the first films. Respect and deep care for the source-material is evident everywhere, from the still-majestic cinematography to the score to the writing to the casting. Our younger Bilbo is a gem -- easily winning hearts and our faith, as viewers, in a role that surely daunted, given Ian Holm's indelible first-impression. The effects, in a world that has become trapped in a love/hate relationship with effects, still astound due to the sensible craftsmanship. Poetic license remains poetic; Radagast and his racing Rhosgobel rabbits are a winsome joy and quite well-conceived. The action scenes are as awe-inspiring as ever, whether under the Misty Mountain in the domain of the Goblin King (fab VoiceOver by the legend Barry Humphries!) orat cliff's edge as wargs close-in on our intrepid band. If I were to detract a star it might be for pacing--there are a few minor hump-spots--but it wouldn't be for content, so five stars. The film resonates with luminous wonder and leaves so many other contemporary offerings in the dust, in terms of quality and spectacle. The Warner money-grab in December is annoying but to be expected, and I can't comment on corporate greed in giving a review about this product in and of itself. This Blu-Ray/DVD/Ultra package is THE MOVIE and it is cherished. Enjoy fabulous storytelling/film-making like this before the entire world goes off the boil and no one has so much as a clue about what's decent and worthy any longer.
B00340ESIS|5.0|This was the late Blake Snyder's first book, but it was my second purchase of his books. I enjoyed the conversational tone of his writing and I felt like a friend was giving me some insider's advice.<br /><br />I have read a good number of books on writing novels and movies. This was the one that helped me to &#34;connect the dots&#34; and better understand the process and different approaches I had read about in previous books.<br /><br />I loved the book and I would recommend it.
B00BCOGM78|5.0|Greats music from an awesome band. One of the best ones. Clutch will not conform to your rock & roll rules.
0547564651|5.0|It seems that many people who have reviewed this book poorly were hoping from the title to gain some specific parental guidance that they could utilize in their own homes.  This book isn't exactly that, so I hate to see people review it poorly for not delivering on their expectations, rather than taking the book for what it is.  You aren't going to find specific parenting advice here; you will find overviews of scientific studies as well as accounts of some places the conclusions of those studies have best been put into practice.<br /><br />This book does come to a good conclusion about general things we as a society, and as individuals, can do to help children reach their full potential; give them a minimally stressful environment where they are not afraid of failure, where they do fail but learn from those failures.<br /><br />I encourage anyone who enjoyed the book to also check out Paul Tough's contributions to This American Life.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app works great and is perfect for my Kindle.<br />It's easy to search and pick the video from the list. I like the format.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|Matthew McConaughey plays a lawyer who goes to the client,scene, in his Lincoln car with chauffeur. He doesn't have an office and works out of the Lincoln. The movie will keep you quessing and has an unpredictable ending with plenty of action.  This is one of McConaughey's best roles as a lawyer and I highly recommend it-
B00APJLFEG|5.0|It was a cute movie my grand daughter and I loved it! It was clear and no problems viewing it. I watched it on my kindle fire.
069111966X|5.0|This book is the foundation for logical thinking and systematically breaking down problems to their simplest components. Once the problem is broken down it becomes easier to solve.
B004CURZFC|5.0|My children watched this movie and seemed to totally enjoy it!  The movie was really good.  We needed to put it on a bigger screen but it was okay.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|To be honest, I came to this book from a review in the Wall Street Journal, and I'm very happy I took the leap and bought the book. It's been a while since I actually had trouble putting a book down, but the last few nights I have been reluctant to do so, and kept finding myself mulling the bits I had just read as I drifted off. Seriously a good book, and a great psychological examination of human curiosity and the need to maintain order, and all that can go wrong in their struggle. Or at least that's what I got from it. Thanks for the book, and for making it affordable, Mr. Howey. You seem like a smart guy and an all around class act.
B008KE3960|4.0|My children play this game and they seem to enjoy it.  I have one son who is really into history and flying and so this game seems just perfect for him.  It keeps him entertained if we need to go somewhere and he has to wait!
B003UESJ9M|5.0|We love this movie, it displays. Lot of life lessons long with great music! Recommend it for teens on up.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This is another game that my children play.  They seem to enjoy playing it.  It has good graphics and they seem to be able to get it to do what they want and complete a level.  I would recommend this app.
B000J159N8|5.0|The subject, the humanity, the valuing of human life and the emotion of life, loss, questions, loyalty to man and country. Reminds me of how luck I am that my father returned. As good if not better that Saving Private Ryan and Thin Red Line.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This has been a really good app.  I have found it easy to review and use to keep in touch with my friends.  If I am in a hurry or just waiting for one of my children, I can access this app and keep up with my friends.  This has been very convenient also, I don't always have to be on my computer to respond or post comments!
B0052ZQMLO|5.0|I bought this dictionary to help me with my German when reading and I find it fantastic! When many cannot find a word when it is declined, this dictionary finds it without problems. I had no problems installing it to my Kindle, in fact, it is not necessary to predefine it as the reference dictionary because when you click on the word it opens automatically. The price is also very affordable. I really recommend this dictionary for both beginners and intermediate German students because it is very complete and easy to use.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is a game that my children play.  They seem to really enjoy it and it seems to work very well for them. I would recommend it to others.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow!!! I just finished hopeless and I am enthralled by Colleen Hoover. I love slammed and point of retreat so much that I didn't need to read the synopsis of hopeless. I just downloaded hoping it will be just as good. It was so butterflying good that I more than LIVED it! Yes L. I. V. E. D.... If you've read Hopeless, you know what I am talking about!. I want to say so much but I don't want to spoil anything for those who have not read Hopeless, but I will say this..... My favorite part is when it's revealed how the name Hopeless came to be. That without a doubt was my favorite moment in the book. This was an awesome read!!!
B003ITZBVS|5.0|This was a great movie more for teens and adults but the Joker was my favorite character in this film.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Series 3 is really good. Very intense.<br />Can't believe we are losing such strong main characters.<br />I believe in these writers though.  This story will continue to hold me.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|The new  &#34;Classical&#34;, movie and game music is GREAT! Move over Mozart, we have finally moved beyond the Beatles and others.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I would highly recommend this show to everyone.  Couldn't stop watching it.  Love having the whole season available on my Kindle. Must have watched 5 episodes in 1 day
B00068S41I|5.0|Granny doesnt have a DVD player so i am always on the hunt for a good VHS tape. She LOVED the Notebook! So glad i found it for her!
1608871452|5.0|I hope they make another one when the show is over, make a big book covering all 9 or 10 season and hope they add alot more pull out stuff. collectors item that you can only get from the book. Too bad no one ever made action figures!
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Extremely addictive!  I now have to fight my husband over my Kindle Fire, because he's playing this all the time (or when I want to play it)... ;)
0385742886|5.0|Very happy with the condition of this book whe I received it.  After reading it very happy with the story and the entire series.
B008XBHIEY|5.0|This is the one that made people think twice about going for an ocean swim!I loved the storyline and the cast and most of all the action was incredible and no one should ever miss seeing this blockbuster of a movie:-)
B008FPOIT6|3.0|Interesting and thought provoking novel. The book takes the reader on an interesting journey across America, the world and time.
B001NIA27E|5.0|This is my second favorite volcanoe movie!My first is St Helens with Art Carney,But THIS one was one hell of a roller coaster ride of a movie!!!An excellent cast and scenery along with the special effects and lottsa action make this movie a blast from the past that should not be missed by any means:-)
B0073LWEXK|1.0|I still haven't figured how to play the darn thing.  I have just gotten like three moves into the game
B009R5GR1K|5.0|Great app! Very useful especially with the extra features. Convenient and user friendly for on the go. The best app of this sort that i have found
B00BDZV9M4|5.0|item was in great safe w safe packaging, now for the CD itself. the first 8 tracks are great, actually listen to the lyrics and stop buying into what everyone else says, like \\"wayne sucks\\"........ especially if you like Tyler the creator over Weezy.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I have enjoyed this game and although there is some pressure toward in game purchases I have not had the experience ruined by it.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|Google has the world convinced they are the only search engine worth using and I find it just average. Okay.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I am absolutely addicted to kik it's amazing every one should try it. So um um um yea I guess
B000MRNWII|5.0|It is an excellent recording of a beautiful concert. Mariza put out a superb performance on this show. I will look for future recordings.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|I really wish it gave us more time to try the stages. That is why I choose three stars. So yea
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I saw &#34;Searching for Sugar Man&#34; recently and found the story just amazing and interesting, but what really got me was his music which was played in snippets throughout the film. Had to get the CD right away. Reminds me of music my mom played when I was a kid, in a good way!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Easy to use and straight to the point. I am definitely glad I got this it helps a ton! I highly recommend this to anyone with a kindle.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Just getting started but like what I see so far.  Like the size and style of the tiles.  Look forward to finding out more.
B009X01ELC|5.0|Like the product would recommend it.<br />Love the rotation feature, works well.<br />Good quality and very nice feel.<br />Like the built in hand strap.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|his game is one of the best games i have got for my kindle. but keep in mind that you can buy short cuts to unlock almost every thing or you can play it
B006LSZECO|5.0|This very well-written novel keeps you guessing the entire time. Just when you think you have it figured out  new twist is thrown in.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I was lucky enough to snag this as a free app and I'm so glad I did. I've been hooked ever since! Great game, storyline, graphics, etc! Definitely give this game a go you won't regret it!
B0095P29EG|5.0|So you are looking for something with a rich storyline, character development, and reasonable plot line?<br /><br /> Go elsewhere. This tale is based a comic book and the movie is more like one than you might expect. The visuals are sumptuous (Asgard in particular) but the characters don't have real depth. The action sequences are also excellent but once again, seem two-dimensional.<br /><br /> As a great movie, it isn't. As a &#34;ride&#34; it excels.
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|The game was interesting.  I havent really gotten into it so I dont know if itll get any better.  Right now I rate 3 stars.....could be better.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is not a book I would have picked to read but my book club picked it. Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down.  Victoria's story was very touching and moving.  I highly recommend reading this book.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Okay so this is a no brainer game. My son &amp; I each play and compare prizes. Wish it generated more coins quicker, but then I would probably play for too long! Kind of an addictive little app.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The perfect book for a lazy afternoon. Easy read, unusual plot, with some twists and turns I didn't see coming!
B009GEFXLC|3.0|It was difficult only giving 3stars. But I just don't really like season 5 nearly as much as the other 4.....the tension is gone!!<br />It's still worth watching, Castle and Beckett will always be entertaining!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Of course, reading a book that's guaranteed to be heartbreaking doesn't make all that much sense...but sometimes it's refreshing. This one certainly falls into that! It's easy to become attached to these characters and by the end you feel like the type of \\"casualty\\" referred to within its pages. I don't know how many times I had to stop, take a few deep breaths and wipe away the accumulation of tears that made it impossible to read. I think the most important quality in a book is the author's ability to draw emotions out of you and I will certainly be reading more from John Green!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Watching this movie was reliving history for me.  It was very suspenseful and showed what a true hero is.  Excellent flick.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love Jillian Michaels! This DVD is really great and breaks it down for you to activly participate. Love it!
B00B69UQEO|5.0|I'll keep this brief.  I am a die hard Depeche Mode fan and I'm basing this review off the quality of the music although I do have mixed feelings about the packaging.  I think this is a pretty significant return to form for DM.  Of the recent trilogy of albums, Playing the Angel was underwhelming, but solid in my opinion, SOTU was meh aside from In Chains, Ghost, and Oh Well, which were all fantastic songs.  I will never understand how in the world Ghost and Oh Well didn't make the proper album and got slotted as bonus tracks, but that's just me.<br /><br />Delta Machine is gritty, bluesy, and keeps you on your toes with electronic ear candy inserted playfully and masterfully throughout the album.  I was also surprised to hear a couple songs that had flashes of the Depeche Mode of old.  My only complaint is the terrible packaging of the deluxe edition.  The cardboard pockets the discs are in scratch the living ummmm...stuff (I'll keep this review PG, but wish I could use a stronger word there) out of them.  Anyway, pick it up.  I guess the deluxe hardcover book is possibly worth scratching the discs especially if the only time you really need to remove them is to rip to your digital library.  However, for those of you that are OCD about your physical music collection like me, it will bother you.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|I own this game for my pc, and I jumped on it when it became available for the kindle. A fun game, and another great program from Playrix,.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|This CD is fantastic!  I've been playing it for about a month now, and I'm still not tired of it.  You will especially love it if you are a watcher of the television show.  It's a lot of fun to listen to the song and think about the actor singing it.  I'm not really a country music fan, but I LOVE this CD!  I highly recommend it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I just can't wait to get the second book.... this one, I couldn't put it down a second... It was exciting and adventurous and well better than the movie... My suggestion... READ THE BOOK !!!<br />  You will not regret reading this one, this is a keeper for eternity... if you don't like adventure books or suspenseful books, this might not be your taste.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|I was a little apprehensive at first about this installment because of other reviews, but I'm glad I enjoyed it as much as the first. The story is progressing into a more darker theme. I love that. Although it's a young adult title, there are some pretty adult themes to the book, but nothing too major. If you liked the first book in the series, you'll like this too.<br /><br />Now if you'll excuse me,I'm off to read City of Glass;)
B005HEFB6M|3.0|If I knew you needed this much review I won't have bothered starting.  I think the Vulcan is the best part of the cast.  I hope this is enough words .
B002LAM7PI|5.0|this is a great family movie. this is a movie im going to purchase for out family collections. My kids love this movie!!
0345535421|5.0|I highly recommend all of the Song of Ice and Fire books to anyone who is a fan of the show, or anyone that just plain likes good books for that matter. the only part that sucks is when you spoil yourself by reading these books back to back because you didn't know they were even a thing until HBO made a show about them like I did, only to find out after you have finished the last book that george rr martin is notorious for taking an average of 18 years to finish each book. so you might want to pace yourself a little better than I did.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Got these for the Hub and he was thrilled.....we only had the 1st one and it was a VCR tape....so my man is a happy camper.
0316019984|5.0|I liked this book so much that I've ordered another one to share with a friend.  Didn't know what the batteries were for at first, and even thought that I must have a defective item as the light is so subtle. But, once discovered - it only added to the cool factor. This book is as much for adults as it is for children. Anyone who hasn't seen the paper engineering of this sort in similar books is completely blown away.  The 'extra' fold outs within a page add to the delight. Only drawback is that in the rush to see all of the pop-ups, most of the text is skipped.  Can always go back  to read it afterward...
B001VLXNLU|5.0|My future sister and law gave this book to me as a gift one Christmas and I thank her every day since. After I finally got around to read the book I could not put it down. This series is like Vampire Diaries meets Harry Potter. If you are fan of both, like myself, you absolutely have to give this series a try. The characters are just so much fun and books are a breeze to read. I read 9 of the books in 7 days . . . Yep I slept, breathed, and gobbled this series up. If you are on the fence about buying a book from this series, take a chance and jump over to this world because you will not regret the moments that await your discovery!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I bought this as a present for two boys at Christmas.  I had not seen it yet, so was leary, but the two of them were extremely happy with the purchase.  Kudos for me for buying t he perfect present.
B0063M22QO|3.0|I just wish they would have more selections of tiles and backgrounds.  It plays ok for a mahjong game but it's not the best.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Like it. Its addictive. I hope you will continue to expand the tanks and jets and the like. I wish there were more special ops.missions to complete. Good way to kill time
1608870081|5.0|Although I really do love the original Harry Potter pop up books, the detail and quality of this book is untouched by any other. Obviously depending on the condition of the book that you purchase, you will not be able to see everything the first time you read through it
B005V4FJC4|5.0|What can I say - it's my new favorite Christmas album. Love her voice. Hope their will be a sequel.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|My wife and I really have enjoyed this whole series and we're sorry that it ended.<br />Very believable characters in completely unbelievable situations...  Yet even those scenarios were made 'believable' by the creators.<br />Also liked the continuity of the story that carries through the whole Five seasons.
B009A3NGF4|3.0|3 stars means I have listened to this album three times beginning to end and I don't see myself seeking it out in the months/years ahead.  Their first album was spectacular.  This one left a lot to be desired.  Melodies weren't \\"catchy\\" and the music would be great background music at a... err... uhh...  something that requires that folkish/bluegrassish/celtic type background music.  Ha!<br />If you MUST have the sophomore album to a killer freshman album (sigh no more) than fine.  Otherwise I'd have to recommend a pass.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|So glad I finally got to read this trilogy! It's one those stories that sucks you in and makes you want to keep turning the pages to see what happens next.
B001NLCBJI|5.0|I've seen this twice and each time felt transported to Japan, or at least wanted to go there after seeing the movie. The acting is good, one of Scarjo's first films and who doesn't love Bill Murray?
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game and I think u will to . Dragon vale is one of my favorite games an my kindle .
B003XDZMFE|2.0|I love Crocs; they're great and comfortable even though I have flat feet.  And I love this style too.  When this pair arrived I was planning to take them on vacation so i slipped one on to be sure it fit then packed them for my trip.  I was very upset to discover that while the shoes were both size 9s the straps on one were far larger than the one I had tried on.  I simply could not walk without losing one shoe.  I tried using an insert to even them up but the difference was far too great; I finally ending up pitching them in the trash and paying a lot of money for beach sandals at the resort.<br />Since I've never had this problem with Crocs I have to wonder if the ones sold through Amazon were Irregulars.  They didn't say they were but they sure fit the bill.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This edition of Temple Run is by far better than the first one. You are missing out if you don't get it. Graphics are great, you get to ride on a mine cart and on a zip line while collecting many coins. The routes/paths are well put together and the way the power ups were made, is they way should be. Again this version is Aaaa-maaa-zzzing!! Get it now!
B005NFW0U0|5.0|I LOVE the Vampire Diaries. This season was no exception! Definitely worth the buy if you haven't seen it before.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|I loved looking at ther closes but so boring! I was so excited to watch this movie since I like historial movies. I never even finished watching the movie. Many of my friends said the same thing about the movie. I wished I would have read a review before ordering.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I am looking at random news, politics, product reviews, funny videos and music. Guess what I get ads for politics, shopping and entertainment. If you look at alot of porn on your phonr then guess what, you are going to get advertisements for porn.<br /><br />Anyways, this app works great! I have been using it since my Droid 1, no problems.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A very fun game. I enjoy it because I don't have any pet and I like to think I can have one with My Horse!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Perhaps a real (Android) gamer would like this better, but I tend to play things like this while half listening to teleconferences or traveling, etc. It's a good time-waster.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|Kept me coming back for more! The name sounds kinda lame but it was a really hard but fun game!
B009FZFONO|5.0|This show is amazing!  I don't watch it because of the &#34;zombies&#34;, or as they are known on the show, walkers. (their deaths, and the methods used to dispatch them, even though necessary, still cause me to shut my eyes..lol.).  The show is about the end of days, and how certain groups who managed to survive at impossible odds, maintain their safety and lives. The relationships, the people, the bonds between them and the way the stories unfold are timeless.  The acting is superior to most dramas on the air today.  I look forward to the show every week, and am already missing the show for the summer.  Next Sunday is the season finale, and I can't wait to see how the season's conflicts are resolved!  I'd give it 10 stars if I could!
B008M721MS|5.0|Ok live h sh us us us NA jaia wjabzis Susan shs ha auw aia Jan ajs Wu's s.  Ua
B009GED3HS|3.0|When I put the episode to full screen mode, it was warped. What would be the top left corner of the screen was past the top middle of the screen.  It kept buffering as well.
B0049J2CKE|3.0|This film is great for kids but way to juvinile for adults.  I was making ratatouille so I watched it.  The food was better.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Loved this book!! I read gone girl and really liked it so decided to give sharp objects a try. Really well written with great twists at the end. Beginning is a bit slow so don't put it down if you're not captivated in the first 50 pages.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|Great acting, interesting story, some surprising changes - all in all really fun to watch and very much in line with the spirit of the Star Trek characters and universe.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I heard a lot about this book before I finally decided to read it. I am so glad that I did. It is very well written and made me laugh out loud at times. The author did an amazing job at forming the characters and it kept me wanting to read more the entire time.
B007A4SDCG|3.0|I enjoyed reading this, but for me personally, I need to remind myself that I am not &#34;At War&#34; as an artist.<br /><br />It is a privilege to be a working artist.  It is a joy to live my dream.<br /><br />I remind myself every day of how lucky I am, and that I approach my work with joy and wonder.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Loved the story and Pi's adventure with the tiger .  The actor that played Pi was great. I like the way the story ended you wondered if it was true.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Matthew McConaughey plays a serious role in this movie instead of a cutesy role (although I am a McConaughy fan so he can do anything and I'll watch it).  I really enjoyed it, nice little twist to it.
160094048X|3.0|I really like Isa Chandra Moskowitz' books. The Vegan Cupcakes one is a regular in my family, even for the non-vegans. But I've had trouble getting the cookies from this book to turn out correctly. They often come out flat and hard, or oily on some occasions. It might be something I'm doing wrong, I'm not sure, but it surprised me since I've had such good luck with her other cookbooks. I do like the variety in the book, though.
B004Z2TUGE|2.0|I can't speak for everyone on this.  I'm a science fiction fanatic, and when compared to the multitude of science fiction I've either read or watched...  this movie just didn't do it for me.
0525478817|5.0|This book is 'young adult' fiction (teenagers?), but as a 20-something I quite enjoyed it. It's well written, emotion, and engaging. When characters in the book felt illness I felt it, too. Highly recommended.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The book itself is written at a fairly low level. Very easy to read, almost too easy. I'm no literature expert, but this even caught MY attention. If I can tell a book is poorly written, that's probably not good haha. Anyway, I'd really give the book 3 stars, but the effects it had got it 4. Being a guy, having read this book, it will start some VERY interesting conversations with women. If you don't believe me, read the book, and tell your wife or girlfriend you did. See what happens. If they've read it too, you're welcome. If not, they probably will, and then, you guessed it, you're welcome. It's amazing to me that so many women have read (and enjoy) this book. I love it, so thank you Miss James, you've done me a great favor hahaha.
B00BCOGM78|5.0|They still kick backside.........<br />Now it just waiting time till they come to a town near by,It is a must see show also!
B00A83075M|5.0|Loved the references to and characters from all the video games from my generation to my kids. Anybody who ever hung out in arcades can relate!
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|This movie is not Denzel's beast movie. It was a good movie but slow for my taste. John Goodman was great in it though he had a very small part.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|So far I love everything I've read by Nicholas Sparks. This book was full of suspense and I liked that.  It kept me reading past my bedtime!!! He developed the suspense with lots of valid details. The only negative for me was  Sparks' development of the character of &#34;Jo&#34;.  Her character was believable for me until the end of the book.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|After seeing this movie you will fully understand ''Give me Liberty or give me Death''. More descriptive than spectacular but still a very learning experience.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|An excellent book, but missing an answer to the &#34;so what?&#34; Question. Gladwell points out what appear to many quirks of fortune but doesn't adequately consider the role of different individuals in making the most of their advantages. What about all of Bill Gates school cohorts who had access to the same computer resources he did?  In social science terms, he is selecting on the dependent variable which makes it difficult to draw more universal conclusions.<br /><br />In the end, we are faced with the ancient Roman conception of &#34;Fortuna&#34;--luck is indeed part of formula--but no answer regarding the relative import of the individual.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This is a great movie.  Kudos to Mr, Affleck  It is so well done that you're excited to the end even though we all know what happens!  Not only did he direct a great movie but I think it's one of his best roles to date, certainly the most mature as an actor.  Whil;e they only touched on it briefly, I appreciated that they didn't sugar coat America's role in oppressing the Iranian people by supporting the Shah.  Overall I highly reccomend this movie for it's entertainment value and it's perspective on important recent American history; the roots of our reationship with iran and our kinship with Canada.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Not many shows motivate me to action but this season of the Walking Dead has finally convinced me that a crossbow should be carried slung over my shoulder at all times.  Yeah I get a lot of funny looks but hey at least I'll be ready :)
B005H9B44A|3.0|Too much of a kids movie for me.  I wouldn't give it even three stars except for it's one saving grace, Sir Anthony Hopkins.  I'd watch anything just to watch him act.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is the best calculator for the person that needs a calculator for day to day use. I will recommend this to all my friends.
B0009MDPYM|4.0|This movie is epic. I'm surprised more people don't have this in their collection.  Keanu just being typical pale bad-ass.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downtown Abbey was initially recommended to me by a good friend whose tastes are similar to mine.  I bought the first season on DVD and began watching.  I soon found that I had to limit my &#34;watching time&#34; or i would watch it all up in too short a time.  I find the characters and story line well written, well developed, interesting and entertaining.  I have very much enjoyed this series.  I paced myself through season 2 - watching only one episode every few days . . .while on the stairclimber . . . With the resistance all th way up  - but am at the end now and wondering how on Earth I will get through workouts!
B007M45PMU|5.0|Love their music... been following them for some time now.  Good to see them at the Grammy's.  The entire album rocks.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Would watch again, the acting, writing and of course the stage set was great, I loved Alicia's apartment and want to remodel my home on the color scheme.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Great show with some good actors.  I need to read the book now and get educated about this family.  The gun battles seem to be a tall tale indeed.
098555780X|5.0|Book arrived on the date promised. The book is fantastic. It gives easy to follow and understsnd directions for an amazing variety of patterns I didn't know existed.
B00BHMETKC|2.0|I don't understand why this movie won the awards it did and received such accolades.  It was a decent film with a good story line but the other films nominated this year were far superior.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I started using AccuWeather at the recommendation of a local meteorologist. I have found it to be easy to use and pretty accurate.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|All three book are wonderfuly written thwy xapture your intrest from page one too the final page of the final book. So good it makes you wish there were more books to the series....and this is coming from someone who is not to big into reading
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Nice game.  Realistic graphics.  Fun for my kids and I too play together or me too play alone.  Really enjoy it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Repetitive, and boring, unlikeable unbelievable characters, I could go on, but I won't waste my time. Don't waste yours on this book.
B00683JK9K|4.0|I liked this game because the pictures were really pretty.  Several levels to choose from.  Even my grandkids like it.
B008NNNF7G|5.0|I have never listened to a band whose songs grab me the way this band's songs grab me.  I love this band.
B00ANW33CM|3.0|The game is okay, but not that spectacular.  I did like all the various games.  But confusing to me at times.  Too hard for my little grandkids to play.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|kevin bacon is great.  this is one of the best shows fox has had in a long while.  great story line.
0752222872|5.0|Scott Adams goes beyond the cartoons in The Dilbert Principle to present the experience and theory that informs his work.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game rules, especially when you go into first person mode. Controls great, awesome mobile twist on Space Invaders. More words.
B00821PCJS|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect initially. To my surprise I couldn't stop watching each episode I had to watch one after another i couldn't stop i've been up till 3 am 3 days in a row. The story line is interesting, acting is good, and it has great pacing (I never feel like fast forwarding). I highly recommend it for sci-fi fans!
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I would hope that Lincoln in real life would have spoken in something more than a whisper, most of the time. Daniel Day-Lewis as Lincoln seems to spend most of the movie barely speaking above a whisper.
B00633W614|5.0|I loved As Time Goes By but the sequel the Sins of the Father is even better. Can't wait for volume 3. Jeffrey Archer is a writer I can't put down.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|Save your money.  It sorta maybe kinda might work sometimes.  In other words, not very good.  What else can I say?
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|I found lots of this book really interesting but frustrating as I was waiting for the bottom line ofcourse, but then people wouldnt buy the book if you told them up front
B0092EE5HY|4.0|I really like the way the author used biblical references.  Also liked the way Tuff talked.  Very clever way the author always seemed to get Tuff out of harms way.  Easy read and enjoyable.
B009O2XY12|3.0|Not a bad game.  don't like the idea of having to have charges to play, all they want is for you to buy more.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I always love the story of true police work, all the ways the police use to find out information, all the hard work it takes to solve a case.  Also love the way Harry is an independent police officer, who doesn't take any crap from anyone.<br />This is one of my favorite mystery series, Connelly always finds a way to make a twist and turn at the end so I can't figure it out.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|If you a fan of other ToR books, you'll like The Ways of Kings. Its decently paced and keeps you engaged. I really enjoyed it. Only downside is it will be awhile for the others to come out so you're left wanting more.
B0088EDMMS|5.0|This arrived in good time and well packaged. Very good price point for a Blu-ray. I could not find a better deal any where else.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Took me a while to get into it since there is a lot of character building and description. But it was worth it. I've never read epic stories so that was why it took me so long. Definitely worth the money and will be buying the next book.
B0077PBPJ6|5.0|Eddie is a great a fine actor in a sensetive portrayal.  I saw this on PBS and have watched it more than once.
B00138F080|4.0|Great band; intriguing lyrics and sarcastic wit make for a very entertaining experience.  Their youth is evident in their angst but justified and refreshing I think.
B000HX4ZF6|5.0|If you have seen it you know. If you haven't seen it then you have to watch it. This is one of those rare movies that simply makes you feel like a better person for having seen it.
B009IQ0TGM|4.0|I am still warming up to it her unique style and lyrics and so far I have uncovered a few jewels which make the rest of the album worth it even if the rest of the songs seem a bit repetitive.
B004XQYBA2|3.0|These puzzles are more difficult than I am used to working with, even the easy puzzles were difficult, but I managed to do a couple of them.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|Better than all this blood and guts sensless killing movies.Great story,adventure,morales,and determination to overcome life obstacles and follow your dreams.
B009O2XY12|3.0|You say this game is free but in actuality its not, once you get to stage 35 you have to purchase the game. I do like playing the game to past the time.
B002AF4Y96|5.0|I cannot say enough good about this movie.  MORE IS MORE. In this case it is TRUE. Everything about this movie works. It has many subtexts, meanings,  even individual frames of film in itsef convey messages. This film is for those LIVING with a LIVE conscience. Who are connected to the Living Force, not for the sheeple. Sheeple will rent \\"the Expendables\\" sand say :wow what a good movie\\" while I think it is sh..t. Sheeple will buy Jennifer Aniston movies. Go watch TWILIGHT Movies.This is not the movie for them. They won;t understand it .This is NOT a nice movie. This is NOT calm. This is purposely disturbing. It wants to irk you, it succeeds. I enjoy its irk. It makes me want to be irked MORE. This movie is revolutionary. It is  almost subversive. It is layered, rich in imagery, brilliantly filmed, acted and Directed. IOy embraces PPURITY OF  SOUL ABOVE ALL ELSE. Tha tis poetic. It is LOVE. Love DOES beat THE DEMON. It also has several messages unintended and not recognized on first view. It is worth and worthy of repeat viewings. It is impossible to \\"get it all\\" in one viewing. If you look BEYOND the simple (the antics of MICKEY AND MALLORY_ you come to the true substance of this film, the manipulation of your MIND by The Media, The goverment, your parents ancient views, the mid washing of conformity. The shackles of Society, the mind pollution that is television. if there is anything LACKING in this movie--I would have to say- (mind you this came out in 1994) is that it doesnt mention the music industry as being just as guilty of the destruction of morals, mind and soul. This was PRE- BRITNEY era. PRE \\"rap\\" and Hip Hop as the leading musical domination. The soundtrack is rich in true genius--Leonard Cohen, Dylan, etc. I don;t think even Oliver Stone could have imagined the further degeneration of society from Dylan to Justin Bieber. But it's all the same--Media manipulation. this is a PRE 9-11 movie. It doesn;t get into conspiracies like JFK (which was no conspiracy -Stone's film was ALL truth).  One of the messages I wish the film had gone further with was the REALITY that our prisionsare unjustly filled with minorities who are on the verge of revolution at anytime. Wrongly incarcerated or rightly incarcertated the overall issue is COLOR.<br /><br />Since this movie--only ONE American movei has ever come out to match wits--FIGHT CLUB in 1999. NO film since 1999 and post 9-11 tackles the issue of Mind conrol. V For Vendetta is a joke compared to NBK in terms of being of a higher state of consciousness. Trying to engage the viewer on a truly higher level of thinking. This is the movie of the 90s. unfortunately, ther is NO recent film one can name that continues to expand, revolutionize, and call for social re-evaluation of your MIND AND SOUL. Where are the sequels?
9562913686|4.0|I had this book in the 90s and the new arrangement is not better than the old edition.  However, the information contained in the book is the same. I want to reread this book again is the reason why i ordered it, alot of helpful information is contained in the book.
B0045HCJ9E|4.0|Good show and it was fun to see again. Cary Grant is always great.  Everything was fine with the order and the disc.
0345803493|5.0|This book has completed my trilogy set. I love these books and the author did a great job is writing them.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|An incredible story. I would love to were a sequel to this one.  How does she overcome all of this tragedy?  How does the relationship with Adam go?  Do they continue in music?  I am so curious as to how the author would write the rest of the story.
B004JZBGWI|2.0|The calendar should have been incorporated with the program because you have to put the date of each event that is on the calendar.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|Total Recall is another action packed movie that is why I choose the rating.  I also would recommend this movie to any and everyone who like or love action packed movies.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|This is an excellent movie!  Collin Firth won a well-deserved Academy Award for his performance.  Thoroughly enjoyed the film and highly recommend it!
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|I choose this rating because this is all I could choose to rate it. This is a funny, funny, funny movie that any and everyone of 21 and over will enjoy. This movie keep you laughing through the whole movie.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|GREAT MOVIE!  LINCOLN WAS A MAN OF HIS TIME.  GREAT PRESIDENT.  MY FAVORITE!  EVERYONE NEEDS  TO  SEE  THIS HISTORIC  .
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I choose this rating because Men in Black 3 is a very funny and interesting movie. I like this movie because it also have a lot of odd devices and creatures that you are trying to figure out. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones plays they part great and have you wanting more. This movie is a comedy and action packed movie that any and everyone will love to watch.
B00785P2QC|4.0|as I said above.<br />good for a free game. hats putting games on fb.  that's life now.<br /><br />that's all I have
B00BSBVLF8|5.0|Have you ever though that a Circus can look like this?<br />Until a new and excellent idea comes to be , it looks that what we have is the best it can be.<br />Charge yourself with patience, try to concieve the work and creativity involved, and you will have an extraordinary trip<br />to the heart of the ARTS. Enjoy.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|Lauren Oliver's Delirium will take you to another reality and entertain you for several hours as you follow the compelling story line with rich characters.
B006VFLIYK|3.0|The plot of an assassin having the tables turned on him, and his fight to determine the truth. A little far fetched as to why his antagonists would go thru such lengths to play games with him when such high stakes are involved. The book was action packed and was a quick read
B0078N2MTE|3.0|So this movie could have been pretty cool, but it chose to be weird.  If the movie had chosen to show the structural similarities between environmentalism and Christian theology in such a way as to make the viewer aware of the difference between faith based environmentalism and science based environmentalism, I would have been more jazzed about this movie.  Perhaps those who made the movie are not aware of how close they came to showing this difference?  Which may make the whole effort of making this movie ironic in a way.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Remarkably well written!- God had His hand in helping you<br /> Form your sentences and paragraphs!!! I needed this. Your last pages were how we do feel...and your chapter on consciousness is brilliant!!!!!!<br />If I ever met you- I won't be able to talk- I will be awe struck with you and your life and with God.<br />GOD IS WITH US!--- we need to be with Him too!!!
B006W0QOF2|1.0|I dig Kavinsky.  I love fast cars.  I despised this movie.  Maybe if they had cut the broad from the script, and made something that wasn't hollywood cookie cutter I would have thought it was cool.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|too many of the scenes were just not realistic  -  no one can drive with three bottles of vodka in his body  -  the fire was a deus ex machine  -  couldn't buy the segment with the imaginary friend
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I should have known the book would be far more engaging.  The movie was good but the book is great.  I am having trouble putting the book down - I want to know what will happen next.
B000I9TY4G|5.0|There isn't much doubt that FOX network messed up when they canceled this show.  It had so much potential...<br />I am glad to see that many of the stars went on to other projects.  Would still love to see what became of some of the characters after this movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is a ton of fun in the kindle fire. It is a great way to pass the time.
B00499NHLC|4.0|I have only watched one episode so far, but I really liked it.  I'm a fan of the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle books & I liked the modern twist.
B008Y1YJZY|5.0|My children and I saw this in the theatre and when it released to blueray couldn't find it at the store, so we ordered it online.  Great family movie and even better on our own 3D television.
B0067R0APK|5.0|Love this paid weather ap.  Great graphics.<br />Can use it to find weather anywhere<br />you choose. Can list favorite locations. Easy to read. Great one day forecast<br />or l5 day forecast.  Has weather radar. Has live broadcast weather that shows travel forecast, breaking weather, extended regional forecast, and local forecast  Has weather warnings.<br />Highly recommended.  Must be connected to Wi-Fi to use.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|THIS GAME IS ENTERTAINING AN REALISTIC. GIRLS WILL LOVE THE REAL FEEL TO THE ENTER ACTION WITH the horse. Must check out if you love horses.
B00B6DTWM2|5.0|Not a big Ethan Hawke fan here, but heard sooooo much about this movie (I LOVE SCARY MOVIES!) and this one did not disappoint! Scary, creepy, story really grabbed me! And that demon or creature! Watch it for yourselves! You WON'T be disappointed!

1616890835|5.0|My grandfather was a sign painter. He installed practically all the signs in the small Texas town where I grew up. I'm very happy to see this book (which I haven't read), and yet sad that he was never interviewed for it. He died a few years ago, and continued to work practically to the very end. The county museum did an exhibit about his signs. Watching the trailer for the documentary that goes along with this book brought me back to my days playing in his shop while he worked.

B009AMANBA|4.0|LINCOLN is one of those films that defies anyone to say anything negative about it.  It seems that Steven Spielberg joining hands with the national hero Abraham Lincoln and the racial equality issue is a sacred marriage and to offer dissident views of the film as a film approaches sacrilege.<br /><br />The film is basically the last four months of Abraham Lincoln's life and the manner in which he struggled to end the war and pass the Thirteenth Amendment abolishing slavery only to be assassinated at Ford's theater For this viewer the strongest aspect of the film is Tony Kushner's magnificent script, a script that places words befitting the times in the mouths of the men and women surrounding the final days of the war and the contentious governmental debate about slavery.  It is pungent, poetic, inspiring, both raw and refined, and captures an era and a time in this country's history that will be difficult to match.<br /><br />Yes, the cast is strong - massively collected from among some of the finest actors in film today. Everyone has crowned the head of Daniel Day-Lewis for his portrayal of Lincoln and Sally Fields as his borderline adjusted wife Mary and Tommy Lee Jones as the acerbic and convincingly committed Thaddeus Stevens, but the others in the cast deserve listing: David Strathairn, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, James Spader, Hal Holbrook, Robert Latham, Bruce McGill, Tim Blake Nelson, Lee Pace, Boris McGiver, David Costabile, Stephen Spinella, Colman Domingo, David Oyelowo, Lukas Haas and on and on.<br /><br />The battle scenes are as atrocious as war is atrocious and the lighting and camera work throughout the film capture that dark period in our history magnificently. Doubtless the film will always be regarded as perfect, but for some it is overly long, occasionally pretentious, at times trying - but always rescued by Tony Kushner's fine screenplay adaptation of Doris Kearns Goodwin's novel `Team of Rivals'.

B005SFS4ZU|5.0|I saw this production recently on PBS and was absolutely awestruck! I RAN to my computer and immediately ordered the Blu-ray on Amazon. Well, if I'm being honest, I actually turned slightly to my right and opened my laptop...THEN I ordered the Blu-ray!<br /><br />I can't say I've had a lot of experience with the Phantom of the Opera musical. I'm old enough to remember when the show first opened in the 80's. So, I also remember seeing Michael Crawford's performance of \\"Music of the Night\\" from highlights and award show appearances. Even as a teenager (showing my age yet?) I was intrigued and would like to have seen the show. However, I certainly didn't have the means to do so back then.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I must admit my first experience finally watching the production was from the Joel Schumacher movie. It's a handsome production. I thought Emma Rossum was good and most of the cast decent. But something was just \\"off\\" about the whole thing...besides Gerard Butler's key!<br /><br />Okay, I confess Butler wasn't as bad as I thought he would be. But that's the problem. Whoever plays the Phantom shouldn't be \\"better\\" than expected. He should be pretty darn awesome, right? Is it just me?<br /><br />So, back to a couple of weeks ago now, I realized at the last moment PBS was re-playing the 25th Anniversary performance of Phantom of the Opera. I had nothing better to do that night and I was ready to watch it. Frankly, some nights I might not be in the mood for a 3 hour plus musical.<br /><br />Thank goodness I was in the mood that Sunday night.<br /><br />This is impressively filmed at London's Royal Albert Hall. It's a eye popping spectacle and all the performances are fantastic. I would say \\"perfect\\" but I'm not some highfalutin expert on the subject of musicals. I do know what I like, however. And I love everything about this production. But I want to gush about the two leads, in particular.<br /><br />I immediately developed a crush on Sierra Boggess. She's beautiful, an incredible singer and a fine actress. The way she looks adoringly at our title character makes one understand why the Phantom falls hard for her. There's a moment where her Christine is starring in a role on stage, playing with an apple. I don't know quite how to put this but...she's seductive, yet innocent at the same time. It's kinda hot is what I'm saying. And, yes, her performance of \\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\\" is a showstopper!<br /><br />To really make this work, you have to have the right actor as the Phantom. Ramin Karimloo is just awesome. The first thing you notice is the voice. Because we're not really introduced to him until after we hear him sing. I've heard him called a \\"limitless tenor\\" and I guess that's a fact. Man, can that guy sing! I supposed one could make a case that the Phantom's voice should be higher and creepier, but a case can also be made that he should be limitless. The Phantom is, after all, a musical genius who teaches Christine how to perfect her singing voice. Between Karimloo's vocal range and his inherent good looks, you can see his Phantom being a hugely successful entertainer if not for his facial deformities. This merely adds to his tragedy. The actor's halfway hidden handsomeness also allows us to buy into Christine's attraction to the Phantom. Sure, she's drawn to his hypnotic music, but it also helps us if we can actually imagine her being with the man behind the mask.<br /><br />But, like Boggess, Karimloo brings more to his role than charisma and an out-of-this-world voice. I was won over by him pretty early on. I thought he really nailed the famous \\"Music of the Night\\" scene in his lair. He also adds a vulnerability I didn't quite expect early on. While I was pleasantly impressed by him in those early scenes, it wasn't until his appearance in the \\"All I Ask of You\\" scene that I fully realized Karimloo's greatness in this role. The Phantom has just witnessed his beloved Christine with her childhood friend Raoul declaring their love for each other. Our Phantom is absolutely crushed by this. He's tearful, shaky, muttering to himself. He even tries in vain to cover his ears, still hearing the two lovers' voices singing...before exploding with vengeance.<br /><br />I don't know what it is. Maybe it's because there's something about the actor's take on the title character that I really identify and sympathize with. He totally breaks my heart at that moment. It's a special performance, along with Boggess, that makes the finale all the more devastating.<br /><br />The video and audio of the Blu-ray is incredible. The production was shot in HD so it's truly sharp and spectacular. Also the encores at the end in which we see former Phantoms singing together is a real treat. We also get a nice reunion with the original stars Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman.<br /><br />But all that is icing on the cake. This is a truly wonderful experience thanks to the gorgeous production, Andrew Lloyd Webber's creative team, and especially the moving performances of Boggess and Karimloo.d Raoul declaring their love for each other.

So I'm in decent shape, but nothing amazing. I skipped to Level 2, which was like Insanity lite, plus aggravatingly chipper commentary on how you should keep at it because jeans shopping omg!!! If you're trying to get what this video promises, do yourself a favor and invest in Insanity. It's hard but doable. This is lame.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series is soooooooo VERY special!!  This is truly television at its very, very best!  Upper class as only the Brits can do it.
B0068RHGJM|2.0|For those of you who want a review you can read in 20 seconds and be done with:  There's a lot of \\"blank space\\" here, almost as if there are a multitude of interludes present (there kinda are, what with Nightwish's first-ever intro, then a short instrumental, a two-minute orchestral intro to Scaretale, the orchestral title track, and the last part of Song of Myself).  The album lacks the bombastic ambition of previous albums, but then, that's the band's prerogative.  In the end, there is too much focus on concept here, which waters down the album too much.  There isn't much flow here.  The album listens much more like a progressive rock album (ala the two-disc \\"Snow\\" by Spock's Beard or \\"01011001\\" by Ayreon).<br /><br />And that brings me to my more in-depth discussion of the album.<br /><br />Recall Rhapsody [of Fire], if you please.  This band released 8 albums spread out over 2 sagas, 4 albums each.  Between the 3rd and 4th albums of each saga, Rhapsody released an EP.  On these miniature albums, the focus was a story - not to write a collection of metal songs.  (I know - only half of Rain of a Thousand Flames fits this description; bare with me.)  Well, when I finished listening to Imaginaerum, it felt like I just listened to something of the style of Rhapsody's EPs.<br /><br />There are no bombastic She Is My Sins, Pharaoh Sails to Orions, Bless the Childs, Dark Chest of Wonders, or even Bye Bye Beautifuls.  Those bombastic songs (or even moments) are simply nowhere to be found on Imaginaerum.  If you've heard Storytime, you've heard this album's rowdiest moment.  And it sure isn't that rowdy.<br /><br />This is by far Nightwish's most different album yet in their discography, chronologically speaking.<br /><br />When I first heard Nightwish had a new studio recording, my reaction was, \\"Oh!  Nightwish has a new album!  Yay!\\"  My first impression came upon seeing that the single which preceded the album, \\"Storytime,\\" was to be the opening song on Imaginaerum.  This is alarming.  That makes Imaginaerum the first album of the band's career to open with the first single (\\"Ever Dream\\" was Century Child's first single).  \\"Storytime\\" is good.  It could fit on Dark Passion Play.  You'll move to this song.  Note, by the way, Marco doesn't sing at all here...<br /><br />\\"Ghost River\\" (track 3) - Marco sings some pretty darn dark lyrics (coming close to \\"Slaying the Dreamer\\" where he screams, \\"I truly hate you\\").  The words \\"drown\\" and \\"down\\" are each heard six times in each chorus.  I was bouncing around during \\"Storytime.\\"  Now, that's gone.  Already.  We haven't gotten very far yet, folks.<br /><br />I don't want to hear track 4, \\"Slow, Love, Slow.\\"  Is anyone familiar with a Fresh Prince of Bel-Air episode where Carlton becomes obsessed with a hang-out blues bar?  Going so far down the \\"blues\\" path and eliminating so much metal/rock from the music creates a lacking center for the album; the album becomes undirected meandering.<br /><br />\\"I Want My Tears Back\\"... aren't tears like virginity?  You can't GET that back.  You CAN'T.  Tears are gone for good once you shed them.  You can't get them back.  So I have to take objection right there.  That aside, this is the second-most redeeming song on Imaginaerum.  It's got the folky elements and maintains some of the bounce \\"Storytime\\" established.  a nice song<br /><br />\\"Scartale\\" - we have a nice orchestral intro, which works, and Annette displays some vocal talents we haven't heard before with her in Nightwish.  But the song goes on for too long!  What's in the middle has nothing to do with the rest of the song.  It doesn't fit.  I'm critical of the whole song because of that part.  I can oddly picture Marco being a jester/joker for this portion of the song.  And I can't come up with any bond between that and what else is going on.  Again - disjointedness has taken root.<br /><br />I won't waste your time with comments on the next four songs.<br /><br />Then we get to \\"Song of Myself,\\" the 13:00+ song that, when first glimpsing the song length, pleases fans of \\"Poet and the Pendulum.\\"  \\"Song of Myself\\" has basically a 3-minute breakdown from 3:40-6:48.  The first couple of times you hear it, you won't notice it.  You'll like the sounds that remind of orchestra hits (\\"Downfall\\" by Children of Bodom anyone?) and it'll amuse you for a little bit trying to get the timing down.  But when I look at it from a critical standpoint, I say to myself, \\"dude, why would this impress me?\\"  And then begins the dialogue and the whole thing is over!<br /><br />\\"Song of Myself\\" (I studied Walt Whitman's poem in a 200-level English course, and I still don't get the connection) has more dialogue than a Rhapsody epic - even the 16:00+ \\"Mystic Prophecy of the Demonknight\\" - which is just absurd.  Know this:  Rhapsody is the established \\"gold standard\\" for epic in the same sense that The Cosby Show is the gold standard for family sitcoms.  You almost have to look at it as you have rules to follow; you can't have this much dialogue.  I don't care who you think you are; you can't do that.<br /><br />Okay so sure +some+ of the dialogue is good:  \\"Have you ever seen the lord smile?\\" and \\"Why do we still wear a symbol of torture around our neck?\\"  but Greek masters SepticFlesh does this in 4 minutes in \\"Vampire in Nazareth\\" and there was metal (some freaking impressive metal at that!) going the whole time.  So why does Nightwish need 6 minutes of dialogue where SepticFlesh just does...<br /><br />And we come to the title track.  If you want to release orchestral versions of songs, do it like Dimmu Borgir and Septic Flesh and don't include it in the standard packaging.  I paid $80 for my deluxe copy of \\"The Great Mass\\" (SepticFlesh) which is the only way to get the 1) artbook, 2) 3rd disc containing orchestral versions of all songs, and 3) the goliath, glossy poster.  I say let the diehard fans have this as an option.  But +don't+ include an orchestral medley as part of the album.  First-timers won't have a clue what to make of it.  (Heck, +I+ don't know what to make of it, and Nightwish was my first metal band in 2001.)<br /><br />I don't object to a musician writing whatever he wants to write (rather, I'm an advocate of it)... but, coming back to my title, I don't enjoy this, so I won't listen to this very often.  If a songwriter wants to record this, he should do it under a different name, not Nightwish.  Look at Samael and their album, Above.  Xy wrote all of that music with the intention of releasing it under a different name.  He shared it with his other band members in Samael.  They liked it, so they asked it to be released as the newest Samael album.  They did it, and many fans loved it, citing it as a return to old-school black metal roots.  I feel Tuomas may have done better doing that with Imaginaerum.  I get that he was interested in composing a film score for this album.  But Nightwish is not a film score band.  (Nightwish's actual soundtrack to the movie is now out; I haven't heard it yet.  From what I understand, only brief moments of this album appear on that soundtrack.)<br /><br />Closing notes:  this is not something that you need to hear twice.  You can hear everything you need to hear in one listen.  This is Nightwish's \\"What were you thinking?\\" album.  Train of Thought, St. Anger, Figure Number Five, Triumph or Agony, Freeman, Blooddrunk - bands do this all the time.  I'll listen to more new Nightwish in the future, especially if they revert to an operatic vocalist for the replacement for Annette (Floor's available - I like that option).

0307352153|3.0|[Note: I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group in exchange for an honest review.]<br /><br />Any book talking about quietness and introversion whose definition of introversion is so broad [1] that it includes me is probably speaking a bit too broadly, since although I am a fairly nervious and anxious person with a high degree of conscientiousness (at least in my own eyes), and a fairly sensitive person who needs a bit of down time and enjoys reading, I am also clearly a person who enjoys and thrives off of being around others and finds being lonely deeply frustrating. However, this book was clearly not written for me. So why did I read it? I happen to know a fairly large amount of people who are far more quiet than I am, do not seek debate or conflict as readily, and who are extremely caring and sensitive, and I wished to see if this particular book could help me understand and appreciate and get along with such people better, and not overwhelm them with my own extraversion.<br /><br />All in all, this book is a mixed bag in a variety of ways. For one, it seems to have a scattershot view of seeking to describe introversion (in a very broadly defined way) in a variety of tasks, painting people with a very broad brush, so that possibly the widest possible audience can see themselves as an introvert in the eyes of the book, which the author probably calculated was good for sales. While this book does contain a great deal of useful material when it comes to appreciating and dealing with introverts and cultivating their approach and their talents, even in a society like that of the United States that seems particularly and sometimes artificially outgoing, this book has some clear and glaring weaknesses as well. Particulalry glaring as a weakness is the way that this book seeks to score political points by attaching a moral superiority to introversion that is unearned and also tying that moral superiority to leftist political rhetoric, pitting Moses against Jesus as a big-government social justice-seeking introvert against a shallow superstar extrovert, which grossly misrepresents both Moses and Jesus Christ. The book's praising of Eleanor Roosevelt, Rosa Parks, Warren Buffet, and Ghandi is no less biased and politically troubling.<br /><br />It should go without saying that this book would have been vastly better had it not had a massive leftist political agenda that the author did not openly and honestly and transparently admit, but rather sought to smuggle it in surrepititiously. This is greatly to be regretted, as the author has some serious and worthy points to make about the problems that this society faces in the way that it tends to force people to act more friendly and extroverted than they are with all of the personal stress and relational stress that this involves. It would appear as if there needs to be better, and less strident, communication and self-examination about who someone is as well as their core values and personality traits. One particulalry poignant problem that couples often face is that introverted spouses often show their \\"best\\" and most friendly self in public at work and then seek to show their real face at home, to the anger of their spouses, who get tired and worn out people looking to recharge their batteries instead of the vivacious people that others often see in public. I can speak personally that this has caused at least a little bit of strain in some of my own personal relationships.<br /><br />Given that this book contains a great deal of sound thinking about how to appreciate a greater balance between introversion and extroversion, along with selective and biased and politically dishonest scientific and social analysis, readers are likely to be deeply ambivalent about this book unless they share the author's biases. Those readers who do not share the author's biases, or appreciate the intellectually dishonest approach and grossly oversold nature of the book will likely find some items of worth in the book to consider and ponder over, some material for reflection and thought, and some chaff to be tossed away as worthless and unprofitable. Since this book is such a mixed work, it is impossible to recommend it fully without providing some warning as to its contents and approach. Let a reader of this work beware that it is not quite what it sets out to be, but that it is not a total waste of time to read either. It falls squarely in between a high quality work and mere political puffery.<br /><br />[1][...]h in the book to consider and ponder over, some material for reflection and thought, and some chaff to be tossed away as worthless and unprofitable.

After reading a review indicating the sharpness difference when they ran a DVD side-by-side to the Blu-ray I was convinced.  They were right about the difference.

B008KYOCA2|5.0|This calendar is pretty much all you need. I really like how now it has its own cloud syncing service instead of only showing syncing with Google Calendar.

However, Jorte seems rather intuitive and doesn't take a long time to use. I like how it has a dark theme now, too.<br /><br />If you tried Jorte several months ago, you should know it has been updated and improved, although I've talked about many of the improvements already here.<br /><br />The alarms worked well when I first tried it, and the battery drained a little faster, I thought, but I haven't checked on either of those since the update.<br /><br />I'm using a Kindle Fire second generation, but I had it on a first generation before the update. I'm really glad they added a syncing feature I can use. :)<br /><br />Awesome app. Thanks!
B004LROUNG|5.0|My first e-book and a good one. Fun story and fun characters. I now look forward to his latest book.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|slow reading - you have to get through alot of history before you get to the guts of the story. its a great story once you get into it. i hope the movie is done differently
B004UID2LC|1.0|I hated this app. I wanted something to get to YouTube on and this is the opposite of that. I want to remove it from my kindle immediately as it is a waste of space.
B00BSBT8M6|1.0|Scary movie, the story doesn't make sense dodn't enjoy the bizar parts of it sp overall it was pretty dissapointing
1932100660|4.0|It is a wonderful book, and I am sure if it is followed completely it is like the author says and you will not have health problems. The only problem I have is being able to follow it completely.
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|This was an intriguing movie.  I'm so impressed with the research that went into it.  We found it to be a very rewarding experience - and an example of how often truly brilliant cinema work just gets lost in the Hollywood hype.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I lived this book! Another great read by Colleen Hoover...Keeps me wanting more! Heatbreak, unconditional love & human perseverance all rolled into Hopeless.  Cant' wait for Holder's POV.
B001XUPH9K|4.0|My family is Star Trek fans.  We like to watch them quite often.  They have action, suspence and entertaining.  Great to relax with a bowl of popcorn and a drink.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think minecraft is so fun I have it for Xbox pc and kindle I am working on a lot I recommend minecraft
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|I love Cirque Du Soleil, even though some of it confuses the heck out of me and I don't really know what's going on or who would ever think of this stuff I realize I don't care it is acrobatics at their best!!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is something I've wanted to start reading for awhile after all the hype and good things said from others. It did not disappoint. It was a little tough at first for me to get into since fantasy isn't really my genre of choice but after I got familiar with the characters and the amazing storytelling I couldn't stop reading. I would highly recommend this book and therefore the series even though catching yourself up (as I'm experiencing now) is a serious time commitment.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love that this version because the added creepers.It is cool because I get to play with my cousin and kill her.Also, I get to make great maps with her.IT IS WAY BETTER THAN THE $4.00 VERSION!!!?!!!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love it. its very fun with very few glitches and highly perfect and supreme to most other games. download it
0525952616|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by the accuracy of the Special Operations jargon and TTP.  He's either done very good research or has sources within the SOF community.  More importantly, his depiction of drone technology, its capabilities, and the threats they pose are very believable.  I anxiously await his next novel.
B003Q6D282|5.0|Marathon of all the saws ...and i must say alot more going on than just gore ...they overlap each other and like then different views ...especially the re-imergence of the DR. what an ending ...saw it in the theater in 3-D ...awsome
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Every episode, every scene...I love it.... You will not be disappointed if you purchase any of the seasons.  Whether you purchase Season 1 or the latest Season, you will enjoy.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Nickarrow4 villager and answer questions that are not the door in the public and answer session with the public  loved this it so AWESOME I give it a 4 states
B000FA675C|5.0|Fiction that incorporates mystery, murder, riddles, suspense and famous artwork, while characters are running around fabulous areas of Europe. What's not to love? Hubby and I both enjoyed this book. Very entertaining.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book is. Just perfection. Hmmmm so hot<br />  Does it turn u on anyone do u like dreamy dictionary books?
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Like this one,pretty well,haven't gone through it very far yet,but seems to be a keeper.I like this type of game.
B000LPR9ZS|5.0|Marathon of all the saws ...and i must say alot more going on than just gore ...they overlap each other and like then different views
B00459EZLW|4.0|Good series, although it does match the same 'dark' writing style as Battlestar.  What happened to writing shows that progress at a regular pace and are set on spaceships designed with adequate lighting!?
B00C1C0GEK|2.0|I like Kevin Bacon and find James Purefoy reasonably compelling in his evil portrayal of a serial killer. But this show is simply prurient. In the end I have concluded that it glorifies and sexualizes sadism. I don't think I have ever been \\"lifted\\" out of a story on television before with the creeping realization that what I was watching was not merely amoral, but immoral.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong -- I have a strong tolerance for visual violence. I've watched every episode of Dexter, I loved Pulp Fiction.<br /><br />There isn't sufficient examination of the moral story in this series to make it anything beyond pornography.<br /><br />I turned it off in the middle of the last episode and deleted it from our DVR.
B00123LIPK|5.0|The best of Madonna's early work. What else could you ask for? The Immaculate Collection is one of the  ultimate collections to have.
B008FPOIT6|1.0|I couldn't even finish it. Boring and ridiculous. I didn't care about any of the characters and quit 3/4 of the way through. Boring slog.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is the best game ever!!! we got it for the xbox and we love it. minecraft is the best.
1439190275|5.0|Recommend to anyone wanting to lose weight and work with there doctor to get to goal weight, not a diet just a good way to change old habits to good eating habits.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|I recently visited Hawaii & everytime I listen to Israel's CD, I am reminded of the beautiful islands & friendly people!  I certainly can recommend this CD.<br />Anne
B000KJT8IG|5.0|I have worn out VHS and a few DVD copy's of this movie over the last 23 or so years!  It has become quite the annual tradition in my house!  This copy was purchased just to have a newer media type,  I still have a good DVD of it but wanted to go ahead and get the blu-ray.  I intend to always have this flick around and ready!
B008XG1X18|4.0|Don't use my Fire for Pinterest too often, but this app does make the site workable on the Kindle. Well worth the purchase so far.
B00AMGG52O|5.0|BEST BOOK EVER I STARTED CRYING AT THE END ITS SOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD IT TOOK AWHILE TO READ BUT I DON'T MIND ITS.CHEESY  IN EVERY WAY
B009IEXKXI|5.0|With heart, humor, and humanity. A great read that was hard to put down! A must for any sci fi fan
B000WTXCZO|5.0|I had never listened to this recording in full. But when Dwayne Allman's daughter talked so eloquently of the father who died when she was two on a recent NPR interview, I wanted to hear what she was talking about.
B00A11AN6O|4.0|Look this because I can look at all my stuff any where. lots of gb. I don't know all the fixtures yet but so far I love it
B0041KKYGU|5.0|It's got Cameron Diaz in it,  What more is there to really say? ,  Made for a good movie but I guess the scary part is that there are teachers out there like this!
B00AYJCEYC|5.0|Always loved Michael's music and this is another great CD in my collection.<br />It is really a tribute with a great voice.
B009MFKO3M|4.0|I am thinking a lot of 50's something guys like me are digging this. A lot of piper at the gates of dawn and revolver era Beatles influences. I likes it..
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I was looking for a Bible that I could download and use while I was off line,  Like that it has voice.
B008KNUKVI|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE this group!!! What they can do with their voices is simple amazing!!! I would love to see them in concert!!! New favorite for me!!!
B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|If you loved Lord of the Rings...you'll love &#34;The Hobbit.&#34; Peter Jackson is a master at finding great places to film.
