B0083P1QUM|3.0|I find that the Scarpetta novels are getting a little hard to follow with every glance or uttered word having a significant meaning. It takes away from the story line and may be just providing &#34;filler&#34;. This novel had a good story line but was cluttered up with to many nuances. I have always enjoyed Cornwells writing but with each successive book I am getting more disillusioned. Compared to her earlier Scarpetta novels the latest are &#34;muddled&#34;.

0061124958|5.0|Since childhood Charlotte's Web has been one of my absolute favorites. White has shown what true friendship and motherhood is all about. From the exciting drama of waiting to see Wilmer's fate to shedding tears for Charlotte, this wonderful novel has you entertained all the way.

B00025E1UI|5.0|I have longed for this particular album back when Final Fantasy 10 (the game) was new,and now to have it is a dream come true;the music is so beautiful,it comes with beautiful CG pictures,4 cd's.I recommend every fan of the Final Fantasy series get this,you won't regret it. I'd go as far to say it's a perfect addition to a library of game soundtrack's overall! I will be cherishing this soundtrack for the rest of my life.
B0052OZJQO|4.0|Pina, the film, is very good and the music propels it wonderfully.<br />Somehow, the selections on the CD do not come close to what I thought I experienced in the film.<br />Still, hats off to Wim Wenders and all involved.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I already own the DVD version,but it didn't seem....'Complete'. Sorry, really though, this version is the true version in my eye's since the story unfolds more like a movie, rather than cut-scenes in a game, like how it was in the DVD version.The graphic's look identical to it's DVD counter part, unless you don't own an HDTV.There are a ton of new scene's and the extra's are better fleshed out with CG scene's. Of note,this version is bloody, and slightly gory,(to make the fight scene's all the more enthralling and to appear more realistic than the original version.) This movie is a fantastic CG movie! A must have,and a 9 out of 10!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Very interesting read. Really takes you into what life is really like for our brave men and women fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This is far from your &#34;typical zombie novel.&#34;  Rather than being a straight-forward novel, it is a series of vignettes of how the zombie apocalypse is happening and being handled in different geographical areas of the world, but also in different first person human experiences.  We see the apocalypse unfold through the eyes of a rural doctor in China, a smuggler in Tibet, a Canadian soldier tracking the drug traffic in Greece, a nurse at an organ donor clinic in South America, among others.  It is very thought provoking about the structure of human existence in the present day and will stay with you for a long time.  I highly recommend this book!

1451695195|2.0|For those who want to believe in a heavenly hereafter, Eben's book provides hope while explaining the ordeal of his NDE. I found his personal life to be bland and not engaging enough to drive the continuity of the story. Although I am certain Dr. Eben is a prominent surgeon who is very important in his own scientific circle, we must acknowledge that he was in a comatose state. I am also confused as to how he explains 'consciousness' as opposed to traveling in a spiritual realm. Was he conscious? Was he dreaming? Am I thinking too deeply into this bewildering phenomenon. Only he can truly understand what he experienced. He openly admits that describing his experience in words couldn't possibly give it the adequate justice it deserves. I also have a hard time believing that every living thing is loved. This doesn't sit too well with me knowing there is so much evil among mankind.<br />Eben's Christian background and his newfound spirituality run incongruent to eachother and this book may confuse Christians of what heaven should be. Is it an astro-field where unconditional love is available to everyone? He claims this and I would rather reserve this paradise for those who led moral lives.<br /><br />I interpreted the realm of the Earthworm's Eye to be similar to an embryonic state like a sperm. According to his description, I'm surprised he didn't clarify this.<br /><br />I am convinced Dr. Eben is a brilliant and renowned surgeon in his class, but I was left with a vagueness that didn't satisfy my beliefs.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|This is a warm funny quick read.  I found myself smiling from the  first page.  The characters are interesting and likeable and I was genuinely immersed in their strories. (And silently cheering them on). We all manage our lives and entanglements romantic and otherwise with varying degrees of success grace and dignity. The Rosie Project is about people trying to find happiness and I am sure will be enjoyed by all age groups Nd no matter what genre you usually prefer,

B0067TGSOK|5.0|I ordered this on a whim, not sure how trivial the advice would be. Nothing worse than a book full of simplistic platitudes that you could have written yourself. Not the case here. It is a simple little read and on the surface the advice seems like common sense, but is it? How many people do you know who have started successful businesses for $100? Me either. The author interviews a lot of people who have. Good book.

B00005JPKE|5.0|I shop the DVD bargain-racks looking for good movies. Usually, the cost is  five dollars, sometimes less. I've found some really exceptional movies in this way. Tonight's choice was \\"Letters From Iwo Jima\\" directed by Clint Eastwood. It was just astounding! Well, there wasn't much risk. I've watched a ton of Eastwood movies and I've never seen one I rated as low as four stars. He's just that kind of actor or director. Every time. I vaguely remember Iwo Jima. It was near the end of WWII and I was in the third grade at the time. I don't remember anything about the battle, but there's that iconic photo of the soldiers raising the American flag that almost stands as a symbol for the entire WWII era.. Well, it was a real educational experience in watching this fine film. Trust me.<br /><br />First of all, I was surprised that the film was all in Japanese and  required reading subtitles. That's rare in American films, but I think it was astonishingly effective in  delivering the total emotional impact of this particular film. I couldn't really figure out what was going on until almost halfway through the movie, until it finally settled in that we were with the Japanese as they were gradually recognizing that their forces were crumbling, defeat was inevitable and no help would be arriving to save them. The only thing to do was maintain honor. It  was grim. The Americans arrived with overwhelming numbers and firepower while the Japanese were holed up in caves and tunnels and running out of ammunition. As the Americans pressed ever closer, suicide became an ever more common exit. Some tried the escape and surrender route, but most of those were killed by their own men. Some managed to escape, but were killed by the Americans. War is grim, to say the least.<br /><br />The depiction of war in this film is outstanding. The acting is excellent. throughout  the film. You feel as if you're actually there, even though all the spoken language is Japanese. You can read the captions, of course, but you can feel the story from the superb acting. The fighting and war scenes are grim and ultra realistic, not like the war scenes of the so-called action movies. This seems like the real thing and made me thankful that I've never been in a real wartime battle. Nice movie! Profound from every point of view! Spellbinding! Timeless! Don't miss it!<br /><br />Oh, by the way, There's two discs to  this set and I haven't watched the second. I'll get around to it eventually.<br /><br />Gary Petersonof course, but you can feel the story from the superb acting.

1613832796|5.0|I gave this book a good rating because I enjoyed 'Game of Thrones\\" so much and I'd hate to give the impression to anyone that this series of books isn't great.  But the hardcover version of \\"Storm of Swords\\" I was sent by Amazon is an absolute joke.  It's about 6 inches high, 4 and a half inches wide and almost 2 inches thick!!  Look at some of the Hardcover books on your shelf.  See any that have these measurements?  Its 1200 pages long!  Do yourself a favor and buy the paperback.

055357342X|3.0|After many, many months of reading this book in chapter chunks, I finally sat down and pushed through it. As the third season of Game of Thrones starts this month,  I felt highly motivated to finish the third book in the series.​<br /><br />​Fantasy is not a genre that I normally enjoy. I like Martin's series, because they are generally are more realistic than they are heavy on the fantasy elements. I don't mind the occasional dragon.  I like the wars between the different houses and all of the scheming. Martin is adept at creating rich characters with even richer dilemmas.<br /><br />I found his third book to be a lot slower paced than the first two. Much of the story felt like filler and the story didn't really get moving until the last third. As with the previous books, some of the characters were much more interesting than others. I love the whole Lannister clan, Sansa and Daenerys. I could have done with far less Jon, Arya and Davos, they are a snooze fest.<br /><br />Martin has an amazing ability to write with such attention to detail. However, these details totally bog down the pacing. I don't need three paragraphs describing what they ate at a feast or explaining the intricacies of minor houses. I like stories with a little less detail, so as a reader, I can fill in the blanks with my imagination. Martin creates amazing settings and characters, but doesn't give the reader much of a chance to engage their own imagination. I feel like this is the big fail in his writing.​<br /><br />I am not sure that I would continue with the series, if I wasn't enjoying the HBO show so much. However, I really want to read the books to see the differences between the books and the show. I feel like I have already read three (and own the fourth book), so I should stay the course. I hope that the fourth book is more compelling than the third. It was often a tedious read.<br /><br />​<br />SPOILER ALERT -SPOILER ALERT-SPOILER ALERT!!!<br /><br />​<br /><br />I ​was really happy when Martin killed off three of the dullest characters in a span of two chapters. i cheered!  I thought that this was a great twist and I was happy to see them go. However, he brought two of them back later on in the book. It turns out that it was a false twist. I was not happy with this at all, what a major disappointment.<br /><br />Please visit my blog for more reviews and bookish musings.

B00BNWWVFG|4.0|I know a little something about the side-effects of psychological drugs, and the way they can go wrong.<br /><br />So the idea of \\"Side Effects\\" was an interesting one -- a psychiatrist begins to suspect that a drug-induced killing may have actually been a devious murder plot. The first half initially reeks of anti-psychiatric propaganda (seriously, they list just about every antidepressant out there!), but it turns out to be a clever set-up for a Hitchcockian second half.<br /><br />After four years in prison for insider trading, Martin Taylor (Channing Tatum) is released and reunited with his wife Emily (Rooney Mara). But not all is well with Emily. She shows signs of severe depression, even attempting suicide by driving her car into a brick wall, and almost leaping in front of a subway car. Her new shrink Dr. Jonathan Banks (Jude Law) tries out several antidepressants, finally settling on an experimental drug called Ablixa.<br /><br />Emily says that the drug is helping her, but it's also causing her to sleepwalk. Then she stabs her husband to death, and claims to remember nothing of it. At first, Banks is tormented by what seems to have been a massive mistake, and the bad press that is threatening to sink his career. But slowly he begins to suspect that Emily may have been faking her symptoms, and that she murdered Martin deliberately.<br /><br />\\"Side Effects\\" left a bad taste in my mouth at first, because through the first half, it seemed to be practically cataloguing every single bad thing that could happen to you if you take antidepressants. It was like watching an anti-depressant propaganda film by the Church of Scientology -- \\"if you take antidepressants, you'll end up murdering people! That's how it works!\\"<br /><br />But Steven Soderburgh twists the entire story around in the second half, when it quietly morphs into a sort of medical noir. He keeps the direction muted, sterile and pale, but there's always the sensation that sharks are swimming just under the story's surface, ready to drag Banks down with them. It has a very Hitchcockian flavor, especially when Banks is faced with false accusations if he keeps digging for the truth.<br /><br />And it brings up some interesting ethical problems. Should he preserve his marriage and career and let a murderer go free, or should he try to do the right thing and risk everything? How can a person be punished if double jeopardy protects them?<br /><br />Jude Law and Rooney Mara are the centerpiece of this movie, and Law is simply brilliant as a devoted, intelligent doctor who is dragged into a dark, twisted little scheme, and has to resort to some dirty tactics to get himself out. Mara isn't quite as memorable -- she does a good job, but she acts dopey ALL the time, even when she's not supposed to be. Catherine Zeta Jones does a decent job as a rather brief character, and Channing Tatum... is mainly there to die.<br /><br />\\"Side Effects\\" starts off on a rather odd footing, but it steadies itself into a quiet, rather unnerving noir mystery in the second half.

Sympathetic (and not so sympathetic) characters, excellent details and descriptions, edge-of-your-seat action, twists and turns in plot . . . it has everything. Couldn't put it down.  Recommended to several friends who also raved about it.  We're all anticipating the sequel, so get with it Mr. Howey!
B006L9B6TI|5.0|Still reading but it is the perfect progression in the series following the The Secret and The Power! What I love about this one is there are calls to action. You can read up on all the information you want but if we don't take action on any of it, it's useless. I found The Magic entices us to take action. I did not allow myself to read ahead (as much as I wanted to!) unless I completed the call to action step. It really helped create life changing rituals that has now become my daily world of gratefulness, positiveness and getting what we really want in our lives. Thank you Rhonda Byrne!

Without giving anything away, please make sure you read the facts on the last page after the story ends. This bit of information astonished me as I assume it will other readers as well.

B000EXZI1O|5.0|the cd was great the condition of it was like almost new and it came with the cd cover. cant wait to get more
B004GTKP3S|4.0|Loved this series, especially Judi Dent. There were not enough episodes to justify a second season, which is why I only gave it 4 stars.
B00008OE4W|5.0|I am yet to see the Collectors version, but I've seen Sneakers many times, not as many as Dumb+Dumber though. This movie is a comedy,romance, action, suspense.  Sometimes a great cast doesn't make a great movie, in this case, the movie and cast are both great. The movie also kind of makes you think, even though this isn't a rescent film, about technology. Who is in control, this is a great film, highly reccomend it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I wasn't sure how I was going to like this book. Once started, I couldn't put it down! I was hooked by the story. Yes, the sex was hot and good, but I fell for Christian and so wanted to see him pull through! I am hooked onto their relationship and cannot wait to see what happens next with Ana and Mr. Grey!
B00005N6KG|5.0|Arrived very quickly and the sound and fit are amazing. I have purchased extras to have other places. I have tried tons of headphones at 4 times this cost and none sounded near as good.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I purchased the final episode of Season 3.  I started watching it in Season 1, continued Season 2 & 3, but missed the final episode.  Now I can' wait for Season 4.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|And I had a great time watching it with them.  Days later it was available on net flicks but still happy to have it in the drawer.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved the book, it was a tad bit slow at the start, but man did it get the ball rolling very quickly after that. 5 stars.
B005CRQ3UC|5.0|Bought for my daughter, love it still because it still holds that magic of simplicity but fun all at the same time
B00AMBH70S|3.0|For some reason, Amazon priced this rental at $4.99 giving the impression that it was a &#34;movie to be seen&#34;.  Well, this continuation of the Bourne series should end all future shows.  It wasn't worth the rental fee. As the old saying goes, &#34;Stick a fork in it....its DONE!&#34;
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This is a Great show! I only wish it were still on. Beautifully done! I would like to see  more period dramas like this!
B002NXOQF2|5.0|This is the third time I have had the pleasure of reading WATERSHIP DOWN.  I want my teenage son to read this wonderful story by Richard Adams and his reply was , &#34; Why? What is it about?&#34; And my response was, &#34;It is a story about rabbits....but with so much more!&#34; Read it and you'll understand by the end what I mean.
B00BHMF578|5.0|I wasn't expecting much from this movie. Affleck has his history, but I was totally and pleasantly surprised by the directing, the acting and the story behind the rescue of six hostages in Iran in 1979 during the hostage crisis. I remember how the Canadians got all the glory. But who knew what really was going on in the background? Great movie!!
B000CCBCAS|5.0|Aside from delight in the characters' fashionable dress, the stellar cast provides a joyful, sometimes comical, and understable view of the emotions which drive human behavior.  Watch Hugh Grant and other actors at their best in portrayals of what brings people together in memorable scenes which celebrate life and death.
B00BHU261S|5.0|What can you say about Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren...especially acting side by side. Great movie. Fantastic script, great acting, nicely directed and most of all, a very entertaining story about how Hitchcock's masterpiece, Psycho, came to be!

B007IXWL2C|2.0|I don't like B & D. The characters were more interesting than the sex stuff.  I kept reading to see where they were going and speed read the painful stuff.

B004LOMB2Q|2.0|I found the app to be too invasive in that it wants you to load it up will all sorts of personal information on all of your devices that it will then share with, seemingly, anyone who wants it. I can put info, tasks and files on my e-mail that I can share with all of my devices without Evernote snooping into them.

B005B19UPE|5.0|If you want an easy light read for the beach, this is not the book.  Although this book is a page turner, it is an emotional whirlwind.  You will not want to put it down.  It begins with very short chapters taking you from the past to the present.  The past is about a young ten year old girl named Sarah Starzynski.  Sarah and her family are taken from their home in Paris during July 1942, which, I don't believe is a well-known part of history.  At least until I read it, I had no idea about the Vel d'Hiv.  During WWII, the French police gathered Jewish families and placed them in a holding area, the Velodrome d'Hiver, until they were then taken to camps, and ultimately most to their deaths.  The whole affair is gruesome, but one of the most upsetting parts for me was that they were taken by their own people, not the Nazis.  Before Sarah and her family are taken, she hides her four year old brother, Michel, in their secret hiding place in the cupboard, for which she has the key.  She assures him that she will be back and he will be safe in there.<br /><br />I was so caught up in Sarah's story that I did not want to switch back to the present.  But once I was there I was pulled into Julia's life too.  Julia Jarmond is an American that is married to Bertrand, a French architect and is a journalist for an American magazine in Paris.  They have one child, eleven year old Zoe.  Julia is married to a typical arrogant Frenchman whose family appears cold and distant, except for Mame', her husband's grandmother.  Later in the story, Julia and her father-in-law, Edouard develop a closer bond as they share an emotional secret that has been kept hidden since July of 1942.  There are many secrets and unlikely connections exposed with each turn of the page.<br /><br />In the beginning Sarah's story is told in chapters from the past, then later on Sarah's story is told from what Julia discovers as she obsessively investigates Sarah's life via the history of the Vel d'Hiv and every unsettling thing associated with it.  After the first mystery about Sarah's little brother, Michel, is revealed, the rest of the book is rather anti-climactic.  Even with that, I was not able to put the book down.  The rest of the story still has further mysteries to be solved.  I was not completely satisfied with the ending.  It is left open-ended, although I know how I would have liked it to end.<br />But I suppose that was the whole point.

B003O86FMW|4.0|This book was an exciting sequel to the first. You are constantly questioning everyone and everything,always trying to figure out what the plan could be and there is always more than one option it seems. I have just finished this book and I can not wait to start the third book to see where we go next!

B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I would never have expected this book to keep my interest because lets face it, at some point Dan Brown has to have a book that is not outstanding. There are twists and turns and you don't know where or how it will end.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Caution this product will have you forgetting to make dinner or go to bed on time....  I thought it would be too easy and at first it is but then it gets more complicated and the next thing you know it's eight hours later and you've missed all your favorite shows on tv... Very enjoyable.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|some of the songs sound different then the movie I have but it is great I hope to see a pitch perfect two come out Fat Amy does europe and benji goes too! I wished he had sung more! Maybe they can fix that in Pitch Perfect 2
B002RKSZS0|3.0|Northanger Abbey is a great book, better than the crap that's being published in place of literature (especially romantic literature), today. The problem is that Jane Austen set the bar so high with her other books. I love Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility,. and my favorite (unusually) is Mansfield Park. I didn't like Northanger Abbey as much because the heroine seemed to me to be a little bit silly and childish. I also really didn't like that (though it happens every day and is fine in real life) the hero fell in love with the heroine because of her affection for him.<br />I give Austen a lot of points for satire, but it left me (as a romantic) a little disappointed.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|This book was only okay; can't say it was great, and not your typical Nocholas Sparks book. Was a bit darker than his usual romances.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I just got this app and I cant wait to try it out.try this app out if you cant go to church on Sunday
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I will never forgive FOX for cancelling this show after only one season.  FIREFLY was a wonderful Space - Western - Drama - Romance - type show.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Might be the best one yet! Getting crueler, darker and sexier.  Of course there's the same cliff hangers but here's hoping the next book is around the corner!  After the 4th which I still enjoyed but it was slow going this one was over in flash I couldn't believe I finished it so quickly just never put it down.
B007712XAU|5.0|This is a thoroughly enjoyable & addicting series! The cast - from the &#34;good&#34; characters to the &#34;bad&#34; are amazing.
B00B2064IY|4.0|Some of the tracks are classic Hendrix guitar and others are experiment of sound.  Well worth the price. But it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Dragonvale is all around awesome game for those who like the casual build your own park game. The best part in my opinion is you can breed every type of dragon without spending actual money.
B005D0RDO8|4.0|A very hard story to ever film but I believe Sade would approve of its adaptation.<br />Placement in facist WW2 is very good and fitting.  and the use of Dante's Circles was nice.<br />Like all adaptations there were changes I didn't understand.  I think I understand why you leave out the wives but why start with 9 boys and nine girls just to kill one of each to get to the symmetrical 8 is confusing.  especially since the killing is out of context with the Circles.
098555780X|4.0|this is a real good book.<br />I would like to have the second edition to see what jd comes up with next
B004X2M3N8|5.0|Once you start watching this series, you can't stop. I keep waiting for the next program. If I had my way, this series would just keep on going ....
0740797719|5.0|This is a great book that explains in easy to understand language how color  is affected buy light in varying circumstances. It also explains how these variations of light and color can be represented with oil paint.
B003G94BZC|5.0|I enjoy all of the Dr. Who series programs and can find little fault with any except that it takes a bit of getting used to when the current Dr. is replaced by a new one. Great story lines and acting. Pure fun!
B0093FNZT6|4.0|Enjoyable and highly readable. His writing technique was perfect for the subject matter. Thoroughly enjoyed, will read it again, thank you.

B000E1ZBGS|2.0|I was sort of off put with this adaptation of Pride and Prejudice.  I never thought I would watch a screen play of Pride and Prejudice where Lizzie grows up in a pig farm.  Having grown up south of a good ol' Iowa pig farm, I find it very hard to believe that aristocrats could overcome the odors long enough to propose marriage.  I was also surpised to discover the Bennet family living in what looked like a very large city dumpster.  And last, but hardly least, I was very distracted in the second marriage proposal scene, by poor Matthew Macfadyen's bushy eyebrows appearing very assymetrical.  Although, granted, the director might have been making a plot point with Darcy's uneven, bushy eyebrows, as early on, in Miss Jane Austen's novel, Mr. Darcy notes Elizabeth's failures of perfect symmetry of form.  I don't know though.  Also, I did not care for Donald Sutherland's lisping and simpering.
B00846REIS|5.0|After reading FiftyShades which I enjoyed whole heartedly I came across this novel and absolutely loved it and couldn't put it down.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Don't think too much about the plot, but the movie is good fun with likable, funny characters. Worth the rental fee, especially since we were sick!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I absolutely loved it~I couldn't put it down. It had everthing you can imagine in a love story. I'm looking forward to next the book.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|falling skies and the walking dead are my two favorite current shows... its like the love child of aliens, body snatchers, revolution, and independence day
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This is a fun game that my daughter started me on to help it out. Just something to help relax a little.
B002ZG9968|5.0|Alex O'Loughlin....<br />I first knew him as Mick St. John but that introduced me to this wonderful actor! Let me just say he has totally buffed out since Moonlight! He is halarious in this movie with Lopez and so cute with how much his character loves Lopez's. Really great romantic comedy.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing. It was hard to put it down. I am sad that they will end at book 3. Hopefully the author will come out with something else.
B003OZ7GVY|5.0|Holds a lot of file info for such a small item.  Saved tons of word, picture, music etc. files from my hard drive.  It's great!

B003V5ED7W|4.0|Funny, clean and positive. Great show for a family movie night. Its a great show mon! No problem! The whole family will be talking Jamaican.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|One of my favorite albums from 2012. alt-J does something entirely new with An Awesome Wave, and it's working. Don't miss out. The album is truly an &#34;album,&#34; meant to be listened to from start to finish.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Lots of good, fast action. Some good one-liners. Lots of big-name stars and great special effects. A very enjoyable movie.
B00AE2LJVS|3.0|Not my favorite movie, or anywhere close to it actually, but also not a total waste of time. These period piece movies are always entertaining to me if done well, as they can transport you to another time and place--out of your very own mundane universe. The story is ultimately lacking and has lots of cheesy moments. Good individual performances from Guy Pierce and Tom Hardy, carry the film.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I have been playing  Pac man since i was little . I have try to bet my score for as long i can rember.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Argo lives up to the hype. The Oscar winner for best film, deserved the crown. A close second for favorite of the year was Silver Linings Playbook, which features some of the best individual performances of 2012, but Argo is a complete thriller that is totally believable. Highly recommend.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|great fun game! had problems at loading screen but just redownloaded it and it works fine. its fun and you can get help from friends
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This is a game that had me intrigued. I couldn't stop playing. Has nice graphics and a good story line. I enjoyed plying this game.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|I've been getting a lot of smaller free programs that each do a fraction of what this one program does.  Now I can uninstall all of them.  I picked this up on the free-app-of-the-day deal and if I had known how good it was, I would have bought it at full price.  Now if you'll excuse me, it's time to clear out all those other apps I won't be using anymore.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is fun and better than zoo tycoon. I like the movie clips in the game. I play this game while relaxing at home on a chilly day.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This novel touches so many deep feelings and tantalizingly deals with consequences. I couldn't put my kindle down. I was scared for Sky, but Holder is such an unlikely knight. Thank you for your handling of a subject that many of us have had to live thru ....wish I had had someone like Holder.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game it is so addictive but annoying when you have to wait for things to developers  an fab
B005OZDXR8|4.0|A set of Goldberg variations from the early 70s has come out on Melodia.  The sound is not stellar, older equipment, coughing in the audience, and frankly, I prefer Gould's second recording better but lovers of this pianist will want it.<br /><br />Look for other recordings to be released.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app I have a horse and I use this app to teach my daughter how to care for him when she gets older so my review on this app two  thumbs up on this app
B009O2XY12|5.0|I am giving bubbles a 1000% this is a great game to play and believe me I play it every day.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Very entertaining movie. Good characters and plot. Not too sure about facts presented as being accurate to real story but that's Hollywood. Worth renting.
B009LREA1S|5.0|This movie is the best one to date of the batman movies it has everything and more and the sound effects were great.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this one as much as the first book and can't wait to read the next one to see where it goes.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|I just want to start off with saying I'm a little biased because I have been a fan of stargate since the movie with that said it is a great show in its own right.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This one was as great as the first two and I really enjoyed reading the series and am glad I bought them.
B00A0SLTCU|5.0|I don't know why this movie didn't get better review because I thought it was great and seeing Kate playing the role she did ( I think she's freakin hot ) showed her versatility. Action was plentiful and the sound effect were great.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Hate gore, zombies, blood and guts - then go away! Love well written storylines with action and the occasional major actor death - - then get hooked on this series! Simple choice - watch one episode and you will either love it or hate it - - no in-betweens on this one!
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|I just want to start off with saying I'm a little biased because I have been a fan of stargate since the movie with that said it is a great show in its own right.
B007PS0DTI|5.0|I love watching Kate so this is an excellent movie in my humble opinion. Okay, so the acting of the other actors sucks in places and the overall story is a bit crummy, but for a Kate movie, its just great!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This is a really great show that both my wife and I can enjoy because I'm a sci fi buff and she likes detective like shows.
B007IK44CK|4.0|Typical Tom Cruise Mission Impossible movie - you get what you expected - lots of action, some really good special effects and action scenes  - - and a little guy looking really big in the world as he fights the bad guys!
B008Y1RTUG|3.0|The special effects are gorgeous.  The idea of Snow White as a warrior is genius.  Charlize Theron as Ravenna - words can't express how much I enjoyed her performance.  And that's were my praises end.  K-Stew should have been banned from this movie.  Her performance is the worst thing in it.  When will producers realize that she cannot act?  They should have made the whole movie about Ravenna.  Soooo much more interesting than the tepid, vapid Snow.  Even the mirror has more talent.
B009AJD5E0|4.0|Could have been better scripted, bit long and draggy, but overall I enjoyed it. The story was good, but there needed to be more of a tie in to Alien to make you want to see the next one (if any) DARK!
B002BWP49C|4.0|I have to say that this is the BEST of the Twilight movies for one reason, and one reason only: the pregnancy and delivery scene (not that the Bella and Edward honeymoon scenes weren't delicious).  Holy moly!  That was my favorite part of the books as well.  That was seriously the first time I was scared reading any of the Twilight books.  Forget about the Volturri and other vampires - a human carrying a half-vampire baby is a horrific situation to be in.  And the movie absolutely delivered.  It was as terrifying as I imagined and then some.  However - what kind of crappy CGI did they do to the baby's face? Seriously creepy and just bad.  Stay away from me, weird, unholy infant!
B0081336FO|5.0|The Brits just know how to do it. This new approach to the Holmes character and his relationship with Watson, plus the maniacal thesping of Moriarity. make this great entertainment.<br />Can't wait to see what happens in season 3.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|I've never liked the Cinderella fairy tale because Cinderella just seemed so passive.  But Ever After is one of my all-time favorite movies.  Danielle is a heroine after my own heart: she's intelligent, kind, brave, and saves herself rather than waiting for the prince to save her.  There are so many great scenes in this movie that it's hard to pick my favorite.  I love the philosophical, challenging banter she has with the prince.  I love the romantic scenes in the library, the lake, and in the ruined cathedral.  I especially love the funny scene with the bandits.  This is one of the best fairy tale films ever made.
B009FZFONO|4.0|Great story lines, characters, plot lines, special effects.  One of my favorites, next to Justified on Fox, and also available on Amazon Prime.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This was a very funny and enjoyable book. I have read all of the books leading up to this one and I am very excited to see what Jeff Kinney has in store for the next book
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|The mouse shipped with free super saving shipping and arrived almost 4 days before the estimated arrival date. The mouse itself is great, the weights give it a good feel and the construction is top notch. Being able to switch the DPI settings on the fly is nice and all the buttons are laid out well. I would recommend this mouse to anyone who isn't looking to spend too much money on a gaming mouse.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a great game where u run from a cop. I like it because u get to run jump and imagine the game. [[ASIN:B0083PWAPW Kindle Fire HD 7\\", Dolby Audio, Dual-Band Wi-Fi, 16 GB - Includes Special Offers]]
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Enjoy checking the weather in several areas of the country each day and conditions at our home. The app works well and was very economical.
B004MMEF30|4.0|this is an amazing book... It has its boring parts but if you just keep reading u will know why :)
B009VSW15Y|4.0|Works well and is frequently used. Simple to use with the Kindle Fire which is important with the spouse. Picture quality is very acceptable.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Had its slow moments but overall good read! Wish there was a little more to it or a second book though!
B000IEXVCC|1.0|From the preview I thought this would be a good &#34;who-done-it&#34; story.  Instead I found it to be a confusing, dark story with uncomfortable sexual content and female nudity.  If you watch this, don't watch it around children. If you're flying you could be mighty uncomfortable knowing the person sitting next to you could see these scenes as well.
B005UDD1R6|3.0|aVIA could be a great app if the fllowing problem is corrected. After testing for a few hours, I found out that aVIA is unable to list Playlist contents from the Windows Media Player server WMP12).  I can access the contents only when I go directly to the folders. I can see all the WMP playlist that I have created, but not the contents. For example, I go: My Video/Folders/WMP Server.  This lists: Music, Video, Pictures, Playlists.  I can now play any contents from music, video, pictures.  But none from Playlists.  Bottom line is all my playlists created in WMP are useless.<br /><br />It would be nice if they addded the ability to play to ROKU to so content can be played on TV.<br /><br />I bought this APP because the Playto app does not allow continuous play of playlist media. I am still on the hunt for an app that will allow continous play of all my WMP server media. Currently, I use my Sony Blu-Ray player (BX-58) to stream WMP video playlist contiuosuly to my TV, but it won't do music.
B003UYUP58|5.0|This book has made me into a squeamish hypochondriac but it was a truly great read.  Mukherjee weaves science and storytelling together in a way that I didn't realize how much I was learning about cancer (and the body in general) all while riveted to the individual stories, history lessons and drama involved in the evolution of cancer research.
B009UZBLSG|5.0|This is amazing..I just connect my phone to this and then an HDMI cable to my tv and wow!!!!!..It is soooo cool.I watched a movie using this last weekend and it was amazing. Just beware that some HDMI cables may not be compatible with it...if you have a problem..it is likely your HDMI cable..Would highly recommend for LG Nexus 4 which I think it is the only phone it is recommended for right now
B005LJKEXS|5.0|i try to do things on the inexpensive side of tech. this cable is perfect for my monoprice sketchpad. no power loss, everything works as it should. very happy.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I give Sharp Objects a 4.5 rating because it is a well conceived, well written novel by Gillian Flynn.<br />It makes your stomach turn in some chapters just like Dark Places does, but this novel is about<br />damaged adolescents, among other damaged souls, including the reporter sent to investigate<br />murders in her home town. I love Flynn's writing, which makes you feel like you're swimming underwater<br />wearing laser beam goggles. A super thriller!
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I absolutely love Bruno Mars' new album! It is so infectious and I can't stop listening to it! Definitely recommend to anyone who loves his first album.
0307341577|4.0|I give Dark Places a 4.5. The details of debauchery are so fine the thriller keeps you enthralled to the very end.<br />I was surprised at who one of the murderers in the novel was because he/she played such a small role in the book,<br />but it made sense in knowing the mother of the four children in the back story. Gillian Flynn really knows how to travel<br />in the dark places of damaged lives.

Don`t get me wrong , as a lover of music all my life these remastered , re releases , packed with bonus goodies such as live tracks , demos and DVDs are most welcome . `Rumours`, by Fleetwood Mac is an exemplary example of what a record company can achieve with these anniversary box sets when done with love , care , and respect not only to the band , but to the purchaser of said product . The remastered sound quality on both the cd and the vinyl versions of Rumours are pristine and crystal clear , and truly showcase what an amazing producer/arranger Lindsay Buckingham was and still is . Now there is a man who needs to be reassessed and put up there with George Martin , Brian Wilson , Martin Hannett , and Quincy Jones as one of the all time greats . The quality of the songwriting and playing has been enhanced by the passing of the years and what was once thought to be just a huge selling Fleetwood Mac album stands as wonderful and timeless example of the LA West coast sound . I Love this album . One huge request though , can you do this with Tusk ? That would be incredible .
030758836X|4.0|This is an edge of your seat thriller with all the trappings of a Tom Wolfe novel.<br />You are always guessing at what the antagonist is going to do next. Gillian Flynn<br />pinpoints actions and emotions in a micro-brewery instead of a back alley bar in<br />this story. Superb at 4.5.
B008220DGE|3.0|In a nutshell, THE MASTER tells the story of Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix), a strange alcoholic so consumed with sexual desire it borders on deviancy, who hobbles through his rather miserable existence with all the grace of a hunchback. A World War II veteran of the Pacific conflict, Quell ruins two post-war jobs because of his penchant for alcohol before stumbling aboard a ship while, you guessed it, inebriated. This ship happens to be owned (or, perhaps, commandeered) by Lancaster Dodd (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), a man every bit as odd as Quell, but significantly more charismatic and self-aware. I hesitate to use the term \\"intelligent\\", because that all becomes somewhat relative when you consider Dodd is the leader and mastermind behind a nutty cult he's dubbed \\"The Cause\\". Dodd sees an opportunity in Quell, to both treat the troubled man with his unorthodox methods and simultaneously reap the benefits of Quell's habit of making rotgut beverages.<br /><br />This isn't a film I would recommend for the narrative, because apart from an excellent first act, the film devolves into something meandering and frustratingly obtuse. Lengthy explorations of Dodd's 'therapy' for Quell are broken by the occasional assault Quell carries out on Dodd's critics, and apart from that the narrative is threadbare, choosing to focus on Dodd's Cause movement and the exploits of his collective, or lack thereof. Because by exploits, I mean squatting at the homes of people taken in by Dodd's charlatanism. There are some truly fantastic scenes, including a particularly articulate critic who confronts Dodd at a social gathering, but as the film moves along these become fewer until the last half hour is a bit of a slog. There are flashes of interesting characters, including one of Dodd's obsequious followers who begins to question The Cause, but this is never really explored. The film instead remains entrenched in detailing the odd relationship between Dodd and Quell to the very end.<br /><br />This is a film to watch solely for the performances by the cast as they are uniformly excellent. The cinematography is beautiful and the production design is superlative, but I found the score grating and often intrusive. The film would have been better served by nixing the score and leaving the wonderfully selected licensed music tracks. THE MASTER succeeds in that it's a challenging arthouse film, but unfortunately it's also weightless and largely forgettable, and a rare misfire from director P.T. Anderson. But a misfire from Anderson is still superior to most. Worth a rental./>This is a film to watch solely for the performances by the cast as they are uniformly excellent.

B005J6LKVI|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my teenage daughter who absolutely love it. I found this movie quite entertaining. Buy it.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|If you liked Rushmore, Bottlerocket or the other odd Wes Anderson movies, you'll love this one.  Might be my favorite.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|My girlfriend and I really loved this movie. We rented on Amazon (can't remember if it was free for Prime users at that time) and enjoyed it immensely.
1569242739|5.0|Even my non-vegan family members are enjoying these cupcakes! I plan on trying out every single recipe in this book and I am also going to buy the other two dessert books in this series!

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham does not disappoint with this well spun tale.  I was kept riveted to every detail.  Well done, Mr. Grisham.
B00A7ZXDLQ|3.0|Rihanna has established herself as one of the best pop vocalists of the new millennium, so why hype an album that is sub par with previous acts? It's just the same old fast-paced pop songs, and I was expecting more creativity from her; she's done it before on &#34;Good Girl Gone Bad&#34; and &#34;Rated R&#34;. That's not to say there aren't any good tracks: &#34;Phresh Out The Runway,&#34; &#34;Pour It Up,&#34; &#34;No Love Allowed&#34; and &#34;Love Without Tragedy/Mother Mary&#34; are creative tracks and classic Rihanna. I especially like &#34;Pour It Up&#34; since she loves building this ethos of being a gangster, as she's done in other albums (&#34;Hard&#34; on Rated R); it's actually quite funny. They certainly make up for some otherwise lackluster tracks that won't be anything but filler in albums. For someone as seasoned as Rihanna, she should be doing much better. To date, I haven't enjoyed any of her major singles except for &#34;Pour It Up&#34;. Let's hope that changes.
B0006Z2KIY|5.0|Great story. This is the second one I bought. I give them as a gift because it enlightens couples devotion
B003L77TZI|5.0|Still listen to this all the time, especially when I am driving somewhere in town and especially driving out of town.
B00B0ZT9NI|4.0|All the Academy Awards aside, this was an entertaining and tense political thriller. Good performances by the actors, convincing set design and a plot that sucks you right in. Recommended!
1616550414|4.0|Great look at making of a Zelda game and look at the timeline. The only downside of this book is that it focuses too much on Skyward Sword and little on past titles. Still must buy for anyone that calls themselves a Zelda fan.

B00B5HQLMI|1.0|I bought Ian Fleming Bond books as a kid, in the 60's... and watched the post-Ian movies, this \\"Skyfall\\" one is so bad I want my money back!!  What a waste, and this guy is NOT anywhere near a James Bond.  s***.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|This movie takes so many left turns it should be called NASCAR.  It seems like the writers had four or five movies they wanted to make, and they threw all the ideas into one script, then made a movie.<br /><br />Joseph Gordon Levitt and Bruce Willis did an excellent job of coming together to create one character at two different ages.  The makeup, the speech and behaviors, all put together made a lot of sense.  The people in charge of set dressing and props did a great job - this movie is set 30 years in the future, so it wasn't going to be full-on Jetsons, but I expected to see some surprising inventions and they certainly came through.<br /><br />This is the kind of movie I was glad I didn't pay full price to see in the theater.  It was an enjoyable experience, I didn't feel my time was wasted, but spending under $5 to see it at home was the right price.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|lots of hidden objects but with minimal zoom a few puzzles and soso story lines. still pleasant enough and great graphics to spend some time with. have several other g5 games that I enjoy more
B0099G7KDQ|4.0|You've heard the songs & you know who they are. Either you like it or you don't. If you do buy this...or just keep your radio turned on for a few more months
B001NLL93W|4.0|Not sure where I have been as I'm an avid reader and had no idea about this series until an author friend of mine Tara S. Wood told me to read... and well, I'm been flying through the series.  It is definitely teen fiction, but there are some surprises.
B008KW43TE|3.0|I read GQ & they were blowing this album up for months. So i caved and dl'd it. It's not bad, i could def smash my girl to it but it isn't as good as GQ hyped it up to be
B003GJSUPY|5.0|Great live album. Essential J. Geils for the hard core fan. Get this and have your face blown off !!!. Highly recommended
B0038BBA4I|4.0|You could buy this or you could stream folk rock radio on Pandora. If you really like Mumford & sons you might as well, it's a good cd & you likely won't regret it
0062238868|3.0|Book arrived in condition promised and met all expectations in that regard. Not quite one third thru and enjoyed reading about seal training experiences and writer's unique perspective on what he's going through. So far so good. H. T.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I have tried many different exercise programmes, but only Mike's programme here in this book makes me trains more consistently and have a very good result in just a few weeks to go ! You have to try !<br />Samuel
B008LV8TSU|3.0|This is a long story. And while enjoyed all the imagery and the detail, I felt that it was a little long winded at times. Toward the middle of the book, I began longing for a climax and a conclusion to Sophie's adventure. I am satisfied with all the events and developments of the characters, but I'd wished for less to be more.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|Though the reader never really gets to know the person I found Beane to be such an interesting character.  His novel approach to scouting baseball players and running a baseball team made me think that other sports could also use his methods.  I am intrigued by the book so much that I would love to see the movie.  The author did a wonderful job of flipping back in forth in Billy's life to make his points and give the reader an insight in to why Billy ran the Oakland team the way he did.  It is not your typical baseball book and those readers who are bored with stats may not find it a good read, but I believe that any real baseball fan will at least be fascinated with the story behind the Oakland A's and the man who runs it.
0547884591|4.0|Ferris gets you thinking. He's mostly in touch with good science and in fact brings to a broader light a lot of solid knowledge you'll read here for the first time. You're bound to learn something, probably a lot but also worth doing your research in some areas. Can he cook? The 80/20 rule is his weapon of choice...
B006LSZECO|1.0|I hate when a plot uses a lie that later, MUCH later, is revealed to the reader causing him/her to need to think back over the entire story to reevaluate things based on the new knowledge of the truth.  It makes me feel tricked, and used, and frustrated to have essentially wasted all that reading time on a lie.  Additionally, I don't like any of the main characters which makes it hard for me to enjoy the book.  The writing is fairly well done otherwise. it's just no fun for my taste.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|I have read all three books and I am so happy that I did. This book is truly amazing and worth reading! There is so much suspense, but in the end it was an amazing trilogy!
B0011TMGKG|5.0|We have more than a few Lamaze toys and this one is by far Elizabeth's favorite. It attaches well to her stroller, her Pop and Play and her car seat, so he is always right there and always safe from getting lost. He has great tactual features for her development and he is well constructed so I don't worry about her choking on anything as she shoves him in her face. I would absolutely recommended Logan, or any other Lamaze toy, to anyone that asked.
1598595474|5.0|The Five Love Languages was insightful and relatable! I am always driving and listening to the audio CDs is easier than finding time to read the book.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Having niether heard of nor seen seasons 1 & 2 of Downton Abbey, I purchased the Limited Edition Set from Amazon at a very good price.  The stories and acting in Downton Abbey are incredibly well done.  The only negative comment I have is due to either the BR copying or the original filming:  It appears as though the white balance (color) was way off on some of the episodes, which was distracting at times.
0802473156|5.0|Read the book years ago and have purchased a few copies for friends and family.  They love it as well! Realized I had loaned out my copy and needed it for a school research paper.  Copy came quickly so I could finish my paper.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|A.B. Star Wars is the best one so far in my opinion.But this is the free version so it lacks a lot of the levels and has annoying ads.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I had heard great things about this movie, but I found it a bit wanting. I thought it was going to be a gripping thriller, but its really just a drama about a guy and his problems. The scenes on the plane at the beginning, however, were excellent and very suspenseful.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|So far it has been very user friendly to me and convenient. But this is The eBay app, so why am i even able to rate this on amazon.

B002B3ZXWE|5.0|I love the music in all the Harry Potter Films. I am a great fan and the music certainly helps make the movies come alive. The albums take me back to the films and the magical world of Harry Potter!
B009FZHYKU|3.0|The move to a location and stay there for a season formula stopped working for me. There is a whole world out there and they are now back to the town where he was a cop!!<br />It is still entertaining and I will still watch it but only if something else is not on.
B006B7LQ90|4.0|Really enjoyed this - opened my eyes to a lot of structures and clever applications that I will make use of. Even though the book was written some time ago it all seems very relevant for the web age.
B008220C56|2.0|Tolstoy wrote two epic tomes of class and human nature, this is yet another simplified telling of a doomed love story, simple, tripe, pointless.
B005RUV0NY|5.0|It's been said before, but this is by far the best zombie show ever made. The second season is a bit slow but is essential for character/plot development. Stick with it and you will be more than rewarded in the 3rd season.
B00AFEYUVG|4.0|It's a rare moment, when a film adaptation of a novel rises to a level above the source material, maybe Stephen Chbosky benefited from reviewing his own prose and realizing some of it's flaws.<br /><br />Charlie is a self-alienating high-school freshman who's jock brother is going to Penn State and his older sister has hit that point where she doesn't want younger siblings in her fledgling adult-ish life (though she is still in high school as well). The source novel is epistolary, and the letters all addressed to an anonymous \\"friend\\" but none of the referenced events involving said \\"friend\\" occur in the narrative, I personally took away from it that \\"friend\\" is a journal and he is talking to himself about himself but who knows but the author.<br /><br />The issue with \\"book\\" Charlie is that he lives in 1950 while the story takes place in the late 80's. Charlie is so naive and innocent in the book there's no way he's a teenager in modern times. On issue I had reading the book was that it felt in so many ways like it took place sixty years ago.<br /><br />The movie dispenses with most of Charlies eager innocence and instead gives us a lonely, alienated Charlie that doesn't feel he fits in with anyone until he meets a senior girl and her gay half brother who introduce him to the world.<br /><br />The movie is swift and appealing, the actors all do an excellent job (check out the voice of Avatar: The Last Airbender's Katara as charlies short-lived girlfriend) and it properly makes you feel and laugh and want to spend time just watching these kids, and that says a lot for the film.<br /><br />I don't believe Emma Watson, both beautiful and talented looses her British accent, but instead falls into a sort of American Haught wich can be a little distracting. There's also a slight deviation in a late-story \\"sex\\" scene from the book which I prefer, again, the way it's handled in the film.<br /><br />It's good for an author to get to improver their work rather than see it slandered on the screen. \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" is not a \\"for everyone\\" film, but it's for those who want a good story, engaging characters and two hours to loose themselves in.andered on the screen. \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" is not a \\"for everyone\\" film, but it's for those who want a good story, engaging characters and two hours to loose themselves in.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie is very good. It is well-directed, has good actors, and feels very real. The plot stays on track and doesn't sway.
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|I found the directions were not clear so it took me awhile to get started.  Was not as stimulating as some other similar puzzles.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Angry birds, angry birds, I was sick and tired of hearing about angry birds!  Then I got my Kindle Fire HD and thought I would give it a go - after all it is free right??  I am now hooked and spend entirely too much time playing - but someone has to help those poor, caged birds get free, right?<br /><br />Anyway, yes it is \\"free\\" but you can spend some $$ purchasing upgrades if you like - and I admit I did have to go for a little extra \\"paid help\\" to clear some of the levels.<br /><br />Well, I do see what the fuss was all about - truly a fun game.  Enjoy!
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This is a wonderful book! I've seen the movie many times, but the book is much more descriptive and there are many parts that don't make the movie. I would recommend this book to anyone!
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|I'm not a fan of Adam Sandler. However, this show had a lot of heart throughout. It was warm in an odd way. If you saw Despicable Me (which I believe was made by the same folks), it had even more heart and love, yet with sort of an Addams family zaniness. Very fast paced. Lots of fun references to old monster movies. I didn't even mind Sandler's weird accent. I don't have kids, but I think kids would like it for other reasons.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great voices, false trails, frightening psch revelations. 2013's  evolved version of Fatal Attraction for married people. So many pieces of people you already know pop into your mind and choke your breath!
B000FC1MM8|4.0|I enjoy reading books in series.  Had not read any of the Harry Bosh books so started at the beginning.  The first three; The Black Echo, Black Ice and The Concrete Blond were okay but the series picked up with The Last Coyote.  The story was more fast paced and I am now feeling like I can better relate to the character, Harry Bosh.  I am nearly finished  reading Trunk Music and REALLY enjoying this one  even more than the Last Coyote....I am now &#34;hooked&#34; on Harry Bosh!
B002CGSYNU|5.0|A lenscap is a good idea, especially if you walk around with unprotected glass - this could help you take better pictures without scratches and fingerprints on your lens. I use this on my TG-1 with the lens adapter (note that the adapter from olympus shipped to me with a lenscap that was similar to this, but slightly lower quality finish - the inclusion of the lenscap was not mentioned in the adapters online listing, so i ended up with 2 lens caps, not a big deal because everyone loses lens caps.) .. if you are getting a lens cap you should look into getting a lenscap holder so you don't lose the cap!
B0076DCT2G|2.0|The book took way too long to get into. The first 70% seem like a mid-eastern travelogue. Very disappointed, sorry!
B007SYWFRM|2.0|My KINDLE FIRE crashed and we have lost everything.you say that you can not help get my stuff or level back. Me and my son love the game PLEASE RECONNECT MY ORIGINAL GAME.

B00418NVMQ|4.0|This is a good cd.  Shipped relatively quickly. if you like rock music you will like this music i promise!
B007SGM084|5.0|This was an AMAZING trilogy! I couldn't put it down, but I also didn't want to finish it. I could have read a lot more about Mr.Grey. It was a very well written trilogy! Sexy but in a tasteful and classy way.

0439023521|5.0|What can I say? I love this book and the whole series. Great and quick read. Parts are disturbing, but overall very worthwhile. Makes you think about the society we are in, when you read about theirs!

B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app makes it easy to see how much life is left for the various applications on the kindle.  I use it be for any big projects so I don't get caught without any battery.
B0045XGRQE|5.0|I have an infatuation with Tony Stark/Robert Downey Jr. so I will try to be fair. The movie was awesome. It was not as climatic as the first movie. Although Don Cheetle is an excellent actor, he isn't militant enough. I believe that part was meant for Terrance Howard. Wonder what happened to him????? The movie took a turn for, slow for a short time to fill you in on some info. (Related to Avengers)  I truly believe in HD, HDX, Blue Ray etc. If you don't watch the movie in these formats you are missing out on the wow factor.
B000I9YWDO|5.0|part of my inspiration for writing this review is that i want the movie to have 1,000 reviews, because i think it's a classic. i can probably recite the whole thing from scratch and i haven't seen it in years. it's just a solid, accurate comedy about the idiocracy (pun intended) of modern workplaces. excellent flick.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Not just a educated, touching movie, but hilarious.  The best movie we have seen in a long time.  Thank you to the director and actors, and tribute to the real life persons portrayed.
B000GG4Y32|4.0|The movie did a pretty good job filling in the history of the Communist movement in the US in the early 20th Century.  I thought there would be more about the Russian Revolution.  Beatty & Jack Nicholson were good.
6305627401|5.0|Ah. I had been waiting for so long to add this to my collection. I was almost in tears from the very start. I would advise that this is a film that should be reserved for trained minds.
B00170KA0C|5.0|It's a great forward thinking movie that takes place in a college for women. Mrs. Watson is played by Julia Roberts and she is hired on straight out of school as an Arts History teacher. The students who go there are mostly determined to finish their education so they can go on to fulfill their roles as society wives and mothers.<br /><br />There is so much going on in this movie that it's hard to put it all into words. During the 1950's these were considered very liberal ideas.<br /><br />My favorite line of the movie is when she was looking at the advertisements on the slideshow and Julia Roberts says, \\"A girdle to set you free. What does that mean?\\"<br /><br />The movie is about love, lust, and loyalty and so much more. Great movie.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This is one of those rare books that is hard to put down. It takes place on a Virgina plantation during the late 1700's. It is narrated by Lavinia, a young Irish indentured servant and Belle a mixed slave. The two different lenses are fascinating. There are many raw scenes in this story, but it lends to the harsh reality of the time. From wise to menacing, the many characters in this book are riveting and interesting.<br /><br />I am impressed this is a first novel for the author Kathleen Grissom. It was intriguing to read how she came about writing this book. I look forward to other books by her.
B001H1UQZU|5.0|For someone to pretend to be something they are not... Some people go through a stage in their lives when they aren't happy with themselves, so to fit in, they make changes to please others. This movie makes a good point and shows where lies may get u!
B008FPOIT6|3.0|The premise for this book sounded interesting. It started out well with a strong beginning that gets you interested in the story. But, somewhere along the middle, it loses steam and becomes a rather fantastic and unbelievable tall tale. Not bad, but could have been a lot better.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This was a great book. I really enjoyed reading it. At first I didn't notice that it was going from one time period to another so I was pretty confused and that made the book take longer for me to read. I read one book at a time, so I am usually done with one within like 4 days at most..But this book took me over a week to read because of the confusion. Once I got past that, I really enjoyed it. It was so good. I didn't want it to end! It was amazing to see how time consuming OCD must be for people. I liked how the Author took the time to explain that there is a reason for the characters OCD and PTSD and that there are ways to cope and move past the disorder.<br /><br />I would recommend anyone to read this book..unless they find it hard to read about physical abuse, and I would tell them to keep reading even past the first few chapters to really get to the \\"meat\\" of the book. It is a really great story and I was wishing there could have been a continuation from it. But that's because I just didn't want it to end.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I purchased this for my 4 year old daughter and she loves playing the game.The colors are so vibrant and the game is very challenging. This I know because when she lose a leprechaun... I hear about it, then she starts complaining that it's hard (lol). Reminds me of Mario
B001P9KR8U|5.0|This is a movie you may need to watch more than once.  It moves fast.  A sad movie throughout, but I love the way it ended.
B008EKON56|5.0|I love this thing! I keep it connected to my 3.5mm cable in my car, indefinitely. The sound quality difference between this and the headphone jack on the iPhone 4 is like night and day. Highly recommended. Also, drains the iPhone battery less than using the headphone jack. I don't really use the charging port, however, it does work as advertised.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Great movie!!!  Keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout.  Great acting by many of the cast.  Very happy it won the Oscar for best movie!  I highly recommend you see this movie.
B009Y7YC2M|1.0|Don't buy it. It doesn't work on Mr kindle. It makes all the time errors. I want my money back
B004HW7JI8|5.0|I enjoyed season one and knew it had been renewed for a third season so thought season two must be worth checking out. This show always keeps you on your toes, never knowing who A is the entire season but leaving hints along the way that get you thinking and making it impossible to turn the TV off! Only problem with it is I have to wait ages for season 3!
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Enough people have reviewed the music, seems to vary between \\"not the best versions\\" to \\"duh, were you expecting something new from an artist who died over 40 years ago?\\".<br />I think I'm in group 2. I'm listening to it now and I'm loving it. In any case, there's plenty of music reviews here so I'll skip that and just review the packaging.<br /><br />It comes in a (thankfully) digipak case, not a cheap plastic jewel case. Inside there's a nice unattached photobooklet with a lot of text. But it's the case that i really like. It's black and silver, and the silver glows if you tilt the case to the right angles. Looks awesome! If you're from California or Colorado you can have a good legal time checking out the case while listening to the tunes.<br /><br />Last but not least, mine came with 2 disks (two copies of the same disk). Maybe the CD factory is in Washington state?<br />Dude.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|At times when I'm center stage in one way or another, there almost needs to be a shepherds hook to get me to conclude, and then there is that dreadful invite to a party, and the pall that washes over me, please let me find an excuse that I don't have to go.  I wouldn't mind going if I were invisible and could be in my pajamas, and could leave without saying goodbyes -  I hate those and my husband loves them and they take f-o-r-e-v-e-r!<br /><br />This book gave me much insight into myself.  Thank you Susan Cain
B001UTW7QU|5.0|One of the best programs I have come across in the last few years.  I would recommend this to anyone.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A wonderfully crafted tale of deceit and revelation in the setting of a microcosm of our own world, the silo.  A great page turner from start to finish.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|These fit perfect and are very easy to install. Good price, shipped fast, would definitely recommend these if you own a Plantronics Voygaer or Voyager Pro earpiece.
B003HKN52A|5.0|I loved it. It was very entertaining. A very good dvd for the money. It really shows a true entertainer!!!
B0063IH60K|3.0|Just another solitare game.  no bells or whistles and it is basic user interface.  greeat way to pass the hours of your life.
B000QUUD60|5.0|I love the double dvd set. Its really worth the money. It shows you what it might actually of been like to be there.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I use this app all the time.  It is a great way to stay on top of your bids while you are away from your home computer.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|This is a spooky mystery game. I was hooked right from the very start. Wonderful graphics, brilliant music with an interesting story line. I like that you can change the difficulty level. I prefer the advanced difficulty, but its nice to be able to change that. So my kids can enjoy it too and not get frustrated with it being to hard for them. I only put 4 stars because the touch isn't very accurate. Sometimes when you are trying to select something like a hidden object or a direction you want to go. You have to touch it two or three times before it works. This makes the hidden object parts of the game more difficult because you'll touch an object you know is correct and a red X shows up. You're certain it's the correct object so you touch it again and voila it works. I've played other Big Fish games that are very similar to this one. And they responed the first time when selecting something. I definitly wouldn't let that keep you from buying this game though. It's great they let you try it for free before you decide to buy it. I think if you try the free version you'll end up buying it to solve the mystery! Overall I really enjoyed this game!
B000JQU1VS|3.0|I hade never read this boook before.  Having an e-book version of it really made it a lot easier to read.
B001DXS4E2|5.0|This was a gift for my mom!  We wondered what color the dresses were for years!!  This is such a great movie...they need to make movies like this again!!
0618680004|5.0|Everyone that has more than a couple  of brain cells to rub together should own a copy of this book.
1594487154|5.0|Daniel Pink's assessment of the world today is spot-on. He provides plenty of actionable advice and specific examples for how the tactics he shares will help anyone in their life, whether it's in the business or personal world. The structure of the book and the language used both make it very easy to understand without feeling spoken down to. Pink's carefully-crafted stories and ability to weave laughs into his narrative make the book just as fun as it is revealing.<br /><br />I read sales and general advice books frequently, but books this good don't come around often. I'm looking forward to reading the other books by Daniel Pink (and his future books) soon!
B0012HF5NC|5.0|Action packed all the way!  Stars shine, all at their very best.  Plot easily slides from one point to another.  I never felt lost!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Everyone should support the legacy of this American Hero. He can never be replaced and will live on thru his heroics.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|Great Christmas movie purchased for kids.  Excellent graphics.  Everyone enjoys watching it.  Tom Hanks is wonderful in this.  Great voice choice.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|A tutorial on the Middle East and Yemen.  So different than our culture but yet not.  Fast moving and holds your interest.  Little heavy on the sarcasm from john Corey tho.
B000K3M1VI|3.0|The movie was really expensive...$9.99 because they don't offer a rent option for this film.  I wouldn't watch it again so I don't think it was worth my money.  It was a well made film and the actors were great but it was really long.  I think I would like the book better.
B0091VTISO|3.0|It was pretty good. It is exactly what I expected.  We liked the story line.  Would not go to the movie to see it.
0780626966|5.0|These items were purchased as  gifts and were a great purchase. Price was right. Great for anyone that doesn't like a real scary movie.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|What a great story..it kept me wanting to keep reading to see what was next. Read it in 2 days...Can't wait for part 2 in April!
0062060554|4.0|I can't even imagine  having to relive years of my life in just minutes every day to learn what is happening around me but the determination in this woman to help herself have a normal life is amazing.  The story is very well written and I think this would be a great movie.  I hope to see more from this author very soon!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great app - very handy and easy to use for my purposes - calculating grades.  I never can seem to find any of our regular calculators anywhere in the house, so I appreciate this one on my Kindle!
B00992CF6W|1.0|I love this game. recently my things have started to vanish for unknowen reasons. there have also been signs that say ballz left all over. please fix this glitches or whatever it is.  then I will give 5 stern reveiew.
0060531053|5.0|I wish this had been my first home brewing book, I use it for reference all the time, if you're a home brewer, keep it close by.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|The best show out there I can wait till season 3 I will buy that one to I love the cast and the back stepping is sweet
B00005U8EM|4.0|This is a great romantic comedy to watch Feb 2. I try to watch it once a year. Very interesting idea<br />Highly<br />Recommended<br /><br />If anyone has any questions about this please don't be afraid to ask me. I'd be more than happy to answer any and all of them.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I love youtube and I love this ap. It comes in handy when I download an instructional video. And it serves as entertainment when I download a video that I can't see at the moment, but will be able to see in a place with no wi-fi.
B00005ATZT|4.0|The commentary with Tommy Lee Jones was boring...<br /><br />Still a good movie .Recommended<br /><br />If anyone has any questions about this please don't be afraid to ask me. I'd be more than happy to answer any and all of them.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I got this game mainly because I liked the first temple run. While the graphics are nicer (in my opinion), it keeps freezing, which is so frustrating.
B00B6HY2RS|5.0|Asaf Avidan has a voice like no other. Someone wrote and said they though 'he' was a 'she.' No, 'he' is a 'he.' He just happens to have an incredible vocal range. This is different from the music I usually listen to but it was well worth the purchase. This man is five star all the way!
B00479SVBU|2.0|I have mixed feelings about this device.  It has lower sound quality than most radio stations, but is bearable. Remote control is very weak and you have to earn any changes made from it.  When using the USB drive would display \\"loading folder\\" on screen after every power cycle and hang.  Only way to correct was to unplug USB drive after Satechi device is powered on and then re-insert.  Device does not have power button, and per directions should be unplugged every time vehicle is turned on or will likely blow fuse.<br /><br />So get in vehicle start engine, plug Satechi device in lighter socket, wait until device powers on and then unplug usb drive from unit and reinsert, wait for device to find files and starting playing exact song at the begining.  At this point the device works decently.  Once at destination make sure you unplug the device from lighter socket as there is no power button to turn it off.<br /><br />If you typically travel short 5-10 minute trips you will not likely be happy with this solution.  It is not going to be worth hassle of all the steps required to get it to start working for a song or two.  Is better than nothing for longer trips.  Device is made of plastic and kind of flimsy.  Should hold up for a little while, but concerned it will not hold up from being removed and in and out of socket all the time.  Personally think the device is overpriced for all the work you have to go through to get it to play.<br /><br />Wishlist for next version:<br /><br />1. Big power button to easily turn device on/off. (Distracts from driving trying to plug in lighter socket when traveling)<br />2. For the device to remember exactly what it was doing when it was powered/turned off and resume to the same.<br />3. For device not to broadcast garbage file/folder information to RDS radio display at the begining of each song.<br />4. Fix issue with USB Drive having to be unplugged and reinserted after Satechi device is powered on.<br />5. Wish songs could be sorted by song name instead of artist name.
B006FO3ERQ|2.0|OK, this is well written.  Every sentence is full of meaning and information.  There is no skimming of this book.  If you do, you miss so much.<br /><br />The opening sets the stage.  You know the outcome of the book from the beginning.  Yet, you are absolutely compelled to read to the end, despite the story being so dismal & depressing.  With every twist and turn in Del's life, you think it can't be possible that he can go on. This is a haunting story of innocence lost and the resiliency of spirit.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|When I chose the farm and night I thought is was going to be cool. ITS NOT!!! I found like, three pages, and I went and hid in the barn. Right then, he walked by, and I quit! It was just to creepy. Then I chose day and the road. When I saw one page and him right next to it, I just kept on the road and I avoided all the pages altogether! X3
B00005JO9J|5.0|Enjoyed watching the first season again.  Same as the TV version just no commercials.  Would recommend if you are a fan of the show or just started watching the later seasons.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Wow this game is awesome to play and a little tip you can get Rio,Rome,and New York. So this is the best game ever.just have fun.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I've been faithfully working out on my treadmill for years but have stagnated as far as losing weight.  I knew I needed to do some interval training and heard good things about this workout.  Since it's available on y o u tube for free I thought I'd give it a try.  I didn't think the workout was that hard but I've already noticed results.  I like the fact that it's only 20 minutes which is a realistic amount of time that anyone can commit to exercising.  I look forward to trying level 2.
B001YOYVK6|3.0|Well edited and acted; I just found the whole Lucifer Incarnate concept somewhat boring:  \\"Satan ex machina.\\"  I enjoyed watching Mickey.  A lotta talent wasted.
B007TNS6JI|2.0|The graphics and soundtrack in this game are among the very best of all the games I've tried for my Kindle Fire HD. Unfortunately, the multiplayer mode would NEVER work for me and after logging in and playing a bit almost every day for a couple months, it began to crash every time I tried opening it. I was quite disappointed and after trying a few attempts to fix it, I had to delete the app from my kindle. Maybe I'll redownload it in the future, but I'm worried I'll be spending lots of time building up my characters and earning daily rewards only to lose them all and never be able to fight in multiplayer mode. =(
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|Enjoyment of the movie suffered as the streaming was poor even though we use hardwire broadband to our HDTV.  This was unfortuante since the movie had great scenary.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I have received great reviews of this book, but I have not yet read it myself, so I do not feel qualified to review it yet.
B009CG9JFU|5.0|Great adaptation from the books by Herbert.  Wonderfully done costumes, sets, and acting.  Sting as Fade does a wonderful job as does everyone else.  Five stars.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Purchased right after the death of Mr, Steve Jobs, because I wanted a better understanding of him as a person and his creative abilities.  Everything  I wrote in the first review of the book &#34;WIRED&#34; applies to this book, especially his committment to his family, and his love for his business, which we all know is APPLE.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|I do not understand the reason for the opening nude scene.  Why is that needed in this excellent movie.  If you can overlook that scene the rest of the movie is exciting and emotionally dramatic.  I can see why Denzel got the nomination for this role.  You will be on the edge of your seat wondering how it will turn out and I am not going to spoil the ending.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I do agree with all those positive.  Scorers.  This is so easy to learrn and  set up just be. On it read
B00BHMF578|5.0|The story is very exciting and I love the self effacing humor Hollywood does on itself.  If you love tension and excitement based on a real life story (with some fiction added) you will enjoy this movie.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i don't know all the in's and out's of this app yet but i love being able to toggle between almost any version i want with a couple simple clicks.<br /><br />i would have taken off a star except that this app was free so you can't really argue with that.<br /><br />the biggest downside that i've encountered so far with it is that not all versions are available to download so they're inaccessible without an internet connection.
B0070ZLZ1G|3.0|Tough does a fair job of explaining the importance of grit etc. to success in life.  The stories he tells are compelling, his research varied and thought-provoking.  I wouldn't say I couldn't put it down, but found myself staying up later and later to read more and more.  The biggest let-down is that this book doesn't offer much in terms of helping teachers help their children succeed - rather, it doesn't offer much in terms of how to teach grit, curiosity, or character.  One can draw one's own conclusions from the research he presents - I particularly found his analysis of how we set goals in terms of analyzing the potential points of failure helpful and useful - but you will only take away from this book what you yourself extract.
B0000844I8|5.0|I'm a Stargate fan so i've always loved this movie.  This DVD was everything that i expected it to be.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|ok, a bit bloody, but it is what you expect.  Good story, solid transition to the next phase of the series.  Craig is probably the most believable JB...
B007FEZQF8|5.0|If you are a fan of the Walking Dead (WD) TV show then this is a must own. Most WD fans are super into the show but don't realize how much the actual plot and theme stem from this book and how the original graphic novel is, in some ways, much different that the show (For better and.or worse - read the graphic novel and decide for yourself!)<br /><br />This is well illustrated and exceptionally written.<br /><br />I rate this an A+
B00BHMETKC|4.0|.... there have been reports about inaccuracies, but I don't watch it for a history lesson, just a good story...  the only problem was the attempt at drama at the end... ... we know how the story turn out, saw it in the papers...
141659521X|5.0|This last book of the series is as good or better than any of the rest. I have read them all. Was going to get this one to read on Vacation but I finished it five days after I got it. (I held off the first three but just couldn't wait) ;-)  Am looking forward to the next one ... I hope! The book was in better shape than I even expected!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I find solitaire relaxing and it keeps my mind alert at the same time. Lots of fun. Good variety of games.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Downloaded game for grandson and love it myself ! Trying to get hang of game and get coins. Enjoy each stop and hope to get a lot better.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|As the show states at the beginning of each episode, it's similar to the Israeli TV series &#34;Prisoner of War.&#34; However &#34;Homeland&#34; presents us a very likely scenario on something that could happen here in the U.S.A, if it's not already in play.  Without giving any spoilers, as with any good mystery TV show, &#34;Homeland&#34; certainly delivers the notion &#34;Things are not always what they seem.&#34;
1423140605|5.0|i read this book so many times already this book is amazing cant wait till the next 1 comes out
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|terrific movie, although watch early in the evening so your adrenalin has time to subside. Well directed, action and acting superb. However, several times now, I have had trouble streaming from Amazon. it is getting on my nerves. Twice last night I had to restart the movie and this is not a movie you want to  lose momentum.
B003Q6BQPS|5.0|Fun fun fun set! What could be more heart-warming than the thought of warm delicious baked goods on a snowy wintery day? These Lego people in their winter village are living large! Fun pieces and great feature of the light brick. The ice rink is hilarious and the horse drawn carriage is well engineered. Collecting these sets and building them around the holidays will be an annual tradition in my home!
1451695195|5.0|Along with Emmanuels book, this book is a reminder that there is more than meets the eye in taking this journey on the Earth. I for one need this reminder and am grateful when I find it. Irrefutable evidence of the existance of the soul and its purpose. Thank you for writing.
B001USHRCK|5.0|HUGE set for so much imaginative play for children and adults alike! LOVE all the specialty pieces, the huge tree, the beautiful architecture of the buildings...these LEGO designers really flexed their engineering kung-fu in this set. Delightful collector's set and can provide countless hours of creative play!
B000ICXQS8|4.0|Ang Lee once again proves what an incredible director can make out what was originally simply a short story,with panoramic and sweeping views of the mountains in Wyoming, and the tenderly unfolding love story of the two young cowboys.
0810983915|5.0|it is a perfect gift for any kid  I just wish you had it in the kindle version so it is not as heavy and you could send it anywhere
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is super super rad I like love it seriously you should get this game one of the best I had ever had seriouslyyyyyyyyyy!!!! It is fun for the whole family!
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|I loved it except for the ending.  Hopefully I will be surprised in the next series when it is released.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|The story line is great the acting is top level. Great movie to end the franchise. It leaves you wanting more film
B002ZBZNPO|4.0|Another great recording from Amy Lee and company. A must have for EV fans! Still would have to say the new EV is a better CD IMO.
B005LAII1C|5.0|If you like &#34;family guy&#34; then you'll love this movie. Seth MacFarlane did an awesome job with this movie. Funny with lots of surprising antics. great buy
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|this is  case looks and feels good. my only concert is that it d oesnt look like it will protect my kindle if i drop it.<br />over all if you need a case that you can use to carry your kindle buy this one.
B0049P244W|2.0|I haven't watched the movie yet because I bought it for a friend, so I'm not sure of the quality of how the movie works, but I did expect the DVD to come in the case shown in the picture. Instead it is in a small, flimsy paper cover.
B008LFY6NI|4.0|Nice and  fun but no clear button I love it if it had a clear button I would give it 5 stars
B007VDN1PA|5.0|This little unit let me take all of the 35mm slides that my father and I have taken over the years and converted them to digital pictures.  It is very easy to use and does a very good job.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Decent. May have liked it more if I had read previous books in the series.  Will probably read others. H. Bosch is very capable.
1401937519|5.0|Feel extremely blessed and grateful to have read this book! Thank you Anita for sharing your magnificent story and inspired me to view life in a positive way. Hopefully many more millions of people will read this book and be stirred as well! It's all up to us now whether we always want to be imprisoned by our judgments and fears or free ourselves from them and live life fearlessly filled with love.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|This helps me with words that I don't know how to spell so it comes very useful that's why I like it
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Superb acting with an intriguing and addictive story line.  Very political with some fantasy thrown in - great show and great books. I'd give it 6 stars, but alas...
B005LJKEXS|5.0|The cable is nicely packaged and the wire is flexible.  I run the cable across a room to a printer when I need to use the printer, so the flexibility is important-- no kinked cable or stiff loops sticking up as a tripping hazard.  I thought 32 feet (about 10M) would be way too long, but while it is longer than I need by about 2x I'd rather have some excess cable than try to stretch (as in not laying on the floor...) the cable between machines.<br /><br />The female end is a little tight, a good quality normally but I suspect that the demise of the cable will be from cable end wear someday if obsolescence doesn't occur first.<br /><br />No problems with electrical operation, it works fine for what I use it for, comms to a printer.
B00868AF9O|5.0|A FRIEND OF MINE RECOMMENDED THIS BOOK TO ME,  KNOWING WHAT AN ANIMAL LOVER I AM !!!!  ONCE I ORDERED THE BOOK FROM AMAZON,  IT ARRIVED IN JUST ABOUT NO TIME AT ALL.  ONCE I BEGAN TO READ IT, I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN.  IT HAS SOMETHING FOR EV ERYONE AND IT IS A BOOK THAT I WILL TREASURE AND YOU CAN BE SURE I WILL READ IT AGAIN AND AGAIN !!!!  YES,  SOME OF IT MADE ME SHED TEARS - SOME OF IT MADE ME  REALLY THINK ABOUT LIFE - AND SOME OF IT MADE ME LAUGH OUT LOUD !!!!<br /><br />LIKE MY TITLE SAYS &#34;YOU GOTTA LOVE THIS BOOK&#34; !!!!  SO DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND ORDER IT NOW !!!
B001P1MZNI|5.0|All of the great songs in one collection.  This was priced right too, which made it all the better.  Great songs for both young and old.
B00APJLEGA|5.0|Great movie for kids and parents.  Love it in HD.  Very colorful and fun fun fun.  Highly recommend.  Adam Sandler is great!
B0072GPPNC|5.0|This was a great purchase and a great seller. I really loved this movies. Very heart-warming and moving. The story-line was magnificent. A must watch for everyone over 11.
B0000DJE9R|5.0|Grew up with Michael Jackson. Love almost everything he's ever done, and this is no exception. Great music, great artist.
B004DK5CYM|4.0|One of the finest movies on determination to win. Great story-line and production.Would recommend<br />to anyone who loves winners from the under-dog perspective. Real grit and determinations
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Bought as a gift for my son. I personally didn't watch it, but he loved it. Arrived in perfect condition and timely.
B00BGZ8OLA|2.0|I'm glad it had a choice of endings. The tiger, hyena, zebra was a bit much, but understandable for a person who might be lost.
B00004NRWH|5.0|One of my all time favorite bands. Love everything they do. This was no exception. Great songs. Love it. Thanks.
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|Glad I waited & did not pay movie theater prices. The movie is okay, worth seeing on video. Denzel's acting was good but the story was just average.
B00005QGAT|5.0|Grew up listening to Michael Jackson. He was an icon. Great artist. Great songs. Great performer. Can't go wrong with this.
B007HJ8V76|5.0|I saw this movie when it came out but wanted to see it again because the High Museum in Atlanta has an exhibit of Freida & Diego's art. It is a great exhibit & the movie made it come alive. Great movie.
B00005NWM3|5.0|They are one of my all time favorite bands, so of course I love it. Love everything they do, and this was no exception.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Another well-written Tom Clancy history of a future we are spinning towards. I only hope the real and future cyberwar is as cleanly handled.
B001EOQWF8|5.0|Great animated movie. Didn't think I was going to like it, but really really do. Would recommend, definitely, for adults and kids.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I thought Denzel Washington did an excellent job in this role. I'm glad he did finally admit to what he did and not let the airlines and lawyers  get him off.
B000TGZRUS|5.0|Have been a Megadeth fan from the early club days! They are in my top 5! Great live show Super Dave likes it his way and he's usually right!!!!
B0044DEAUA|1.0|Edit.<br />I can't understand why, at the time of my edit, 3 people found this review unhelpful.<br />This had some great reviews. So, I ordered one. Occasionally you get things in that just don't work. Mine looked like it was working, but I couldn't hear anyone. As far as size, it is great. I tried everything I could think of to make it work, but to no avail. Sent it back a few days later. I had no problem with a refund. Sure wish it had worked. I would love to have given it a 5 star
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I have not been playing this long but so far it's fun.<br />I do recommend this gameI hope to be leveling soon again
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome! The graphics on this are fantastic :) very realistic....even my horse rider friend approves (and she's pretty picky when it comes to horses...)!
1455527475|5.0|It is diary of being in a warlike setting where you move fast or get shot.  The slightest fickleness of chance saves an intern from sliding out of the dump truck.  This book lets you live in the belly of the rip-off-the-smartest-people machine that should not exist.  He had to give up his girl for the company but not his soul, while others feed on the excitement and risk but also each other.  What he ended up doing was a rare act of courage in a rotten, slum-like environment where there are victims and no positive feedback.  Wall Street became like drug traders with junk paper rather that needles.  He stood up for the industry and lost everything.  Comparing brokerage houses to casinos that can read all of your cards was a golden insight that Wall Street will continue to be the devil unless they smash all of their computers.
B006JRSMRG|5.0|Love the show! I had heard so many good things about it and I'm finally able to go through and watch the seasons.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I liked this book alot, would read more by this author. Read on my Kindle, easy read. Never lost my attention.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Well put together, and keeps you on the  edge of the seat. Ben did a great job as an actor and Producer.
B00A8ZZ2Z0|5.0|This is one of the best cds Helloween has put out in years.  Album design and music are excellent.  Even if you're not a fan, you'll love this cd.  package arrived in perfect condition from seller.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Believable characters and an interesting twist on the victorian age &#34;language of flowers&#34; which I enjoyed learning more about.  The ending was a tad too predictable.
B001IBIQU6|4.0|depeche mode does it again.  But after hearing the remix albums I found this cd lacking the excitement of the remixes.  Still a great album.  arrived in perfect condition from seller.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|It was light read, i enjoyed it. But did manage to put it down a time or two. Characters are typical.
B00ATP24SW|5.0|I loved their previous cd but this one takes one step further.  With radical synth solos and great beats this album should do very well.  arrived in perfect condition from seller.  highly recommend this cd.
B005PK553C|5.0|Loved it!!! I can't wait for the next season!!! One of my favorite shows of all time! Recommend, recommend, recommend!
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|It could be a fun little app but you have to wait *eons* for everything to reset so you can replay the level. They also throw in adverts that make you lose concentration, annoy you somewhat and then you have to hit home and re-choose the game and restart what you were doing. Free isn't really free at all. :(
B005COO1X6|4.0|Great book, great build up, scary.  Wasn't sure where he was going with it at all.  VERY strange ending.<br /><br />Still, all in all, a GREAT Quick Read!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Awesome finale<br />Deeply written and dense with great subtext<br />Katniss is a complicated and amazing literary character that lives on
B005K0HDGE|5.0|What an AWESOME book. Steven King, once again, you've out done yourself.  Great Premise, Great Story, Well Told.  Just AWESOME.  MUST READ!
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|I tried to play the free version, it was okay, but the constant ads were annoying. I tried to buy it (they took my money) but it insists I have the free version. Still getting the ads.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I really enjoy reading this series. The second book is full of surprises, especially at the end. And of course it leaves you want more... And I started beautiful Chaos right away.<br /><br />This is a light read that is funny, suspenseful, magical, romantic, and exciting.  It's a great escape into the fictional world.
B008JFUNPK|3.0|I admit, I went into the film thinking this was going to be a total bomb, but a friend had a free ticket for a pre-release showing of the movie, so I thought, why not?<br /><br />The Croods is a story about one of the last surviving pre-historic families that embark on a road trip looking for a new cave when their old cave is destroyed as the earth is going through many dramatic changes. If that wasn't enough for the Crood family to deal with, there is the father/daughter struggles throughout the storyline that any parent can relate to if they have had teenagers, especially daughters.<br /><br />When the Croods daughter, Eep (Emma Stone) can't understand her Dad's mentality that \\"fear is good; change is bad\\" and having to live by his number one rule \\"never leave the cave\\" she starts to rebel and pushes the boundaries set by her Dad, the over-protective, Grug (Nicolas Cage). One of the characters I got a kick out of was Gran (Cloris Leachman) who is their wisecracking grandma who Grug is constantly hoping that she won't make it through their daily challenges. The rest of the Crood family includes Mom, younger brother and baby sister which are more or less \\"extras\\" to round out the family dynamic. On their journey to find a new cave, they meet Guy (Ryan Reynolds) who has evolved alot further then the Croods with his ability to make fire and shoes and his pet sloth who doubles as Guy's utility belt. Together they join in their journey in finding a new place to live, which Eep is desperately hoping won't be another cave.<br /><br />I will admit that there were several moments that the movie was very predictable and the story line could have been a bit better. However,over all the movie was better than I thought it would be. I would suggest paying to see a matinee showing or wait until it comes out on DVD.
1936594234|5.0|This book is a powerful tool for personal development! The power of your subconscious mind is amazing, it never stops working.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this he so much every I go.  Play subway surfer and even if I don't have any service I play it
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is the best app ever for a calculator! It works great and is simple to use. I just love it it's. Just what I needed plain and simple and gets the job done.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I wasn't expecting much but I am glad I took the time to rent it and watch it. Daniel Craig is a great Bond!
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I got totally sucked in right from the beginning. I hate tv and rarely if ever, watch more than a season of anything before losing interest. Well I am deep into season 3 within a few weeks. How did I ever miss this show?
B00APUQPX6|5.0|This is a really cute, entertaining movie.  I don't have children but a group of adults watched it together, and it was a lot of fun.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|storyline is good but I just can't buy Shia LaBeouf as a lead man.  His character/acting kept the moving from being a solid view.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This was a fairly light, entertaining read.  Probably people who were more experienced with computers would enjoy it even more than I did.  That being said, I still found it pleasant reading.
B003B02O7I|5.0|This kept me on the edge of my seat until the end.  I truly enjoyed it due to variety of story line.  Went from U.S. to jungles.  Had a great start and I love that.  I read it, my husband, read it then my daughter (who is 34).  We all loved it till the end.
1475143389|4.0|I think this is a great workout book based on success experiences. The program seems good but little hard, and the information contained in the book are all from science resources.
B000V1Z8KK|5.0|This was such a fun action-packed conspiracy thriller.  I've always enjoyed Mark Wahlberg's acting.  He runs the gamut from &#34;Ted&#34; to &#34;Planet of the Apes&#34; etc.  Mark Wahlberg can switch from comedy to sci-fi to conspiracy thrillers.  This movie was no exception.  It was truly a fun thriller to watch.<br /><br />I won't bore anyone with a long commentary, I will leave you with this:  Pick this movie up for a fun night.  &#34;Implausables&#34; aside, just let your mind go free from any nitpicking you may have with details and you'll enjoy this action conspiracy-theory thriller of a movie.<br /><br />Side note to Amazon:  thank you for adding Closed Captioning to this title.  You've still got 13,000+ more titles to caption in the Prime category.  Step it up!  I didn't pay you Prime $, only to be availed of only ~200 to 300 captioned titles out of 13,000+ available.<br />Step. It. Up. With. The. Captions. Amazon.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Great story line.  I didn't read the book, but now I think I'd like to.  My wife said the book is way better, and I thought this was pretty well done.
B004I9G486|5.0|Worked perfectly. Even displays the Audi logo on iPod while plugged in. I have a classic 30 gb.  All controls work from console including skip. Charges while plugged in.  Never have to go into the glove box to change settings etc. Read the owners manual about max number of songs in each playlist. But works beyond what I expected after reading the reviews. Make sure you equalize volume on tracks in itunes and sync prior to using iPod or some songs will be louder than others.
B00AB2DNBU|5.0|Love older movies especially this one classic horror film done well I have collected all of them and will keep them for my collection.
055357342X|5.0|I bought these books for my son. He has enjoyed this series very much. He recommends this to everyone! Enjoy!
B005J9ZE5I|5.0|I bought this to go with my collection of the others films they re great movies and classics to me if you haven't seen them get them and watch very great films.
1603420398|5.0|A great writer, a great book, with great pictures and great instructions. This hard cover book which is spiral bound gives it a nice touch and keeps it neat and easy to make copies.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|The Shawshank Redemption is often hailed as one of the best movies of all time. While I haven't watched all movies of all time, I can honestly say it is one of the best I've ever watched.<br /><br />A great cast of characters bring a great story to life.
B005C7SXMS|5.0|The movie is awesome! it is a bit on the awkward side...but it's a funny awkward! The soundtrack done by Alex Turner of The arctic Monkeys is splendid. Overall, it's a great little Romance/comedy film which I highly recommend!
B0009VSB06|3.0|This is an inexpensive detector to see if you like treasure hunting and perhaps to let the kids play with.  It is intended for use on dry land (moist grass OK, no immersion in water).  It is light weight, comfortable on your arm, and easy to use and to read.  I tried testing its calibration on metal objects of known composition, and I found that it tended to jump back and forth between categories (between iron and nickel, for example).  It does not discriminate between silver and aluminum, as they have similar conductivity.  It only sounds off while you are sweeping it over the target; if you stop and hold it still the sound stops. It must be in motion to find targets.  It didn't miss anything.  While I did not find my silver ring I did find every gum wrapper, pull tab, nail, steel can, and mystery metal present.  If you are serious about treasure hunting this one may be a little too generic in its hits. It can make for an entertaining afternoon if you just want to try it casually.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Yes, when there a quiet day of doing nothing...time to crank out the Batness and watch it all!!!<br /><br />A good set to have.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|I like the game, but building the various contraptions would make a mechanical engineer pull their hair out.  I held back a star because, to me, it seems to be an attempt to get me to spend real money on assistance of &#34;mechanic.&#34;  I don't spend real money on virtual stuff, with caveat of mp3 downloads.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Purchased this for my fiancee and she loves it! She was excited to see different levels of difficulty available so that you can progress further!
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|Thought with this search engine I would be able to download some google play games.  Can't seem to get the google play app.  I rarely have kindle fire hooked to wifi due to battery time impact.  Getting message my device isn't android.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|The author stated in the closing that he did absolutely no research and did not consult with anyone and  I believe him as it was a very shallow effort
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Excellent insights into the realities of SEAL life and what it is like to experience battle.  Inspiring story of a true American Hero.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|A very quick read as the tension is present from start to finish. The German spy is a powerful character.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|If you like puzzles you will love this the patterns- are tricky but you feel good once you get them
B000001DVD|5.0|Forgot how much I loved the original band, just adore listening to these songs again and the memories!  Great band, love this music.
B003IEJZUG|4.0|This book was slow to start but worth the effort. It left me thinking - which is what a good story will do.
B000001F7R|5.0|Forgot how much I loved the original Def Leppard,  So worth buying this again, threw it away years ago, a mistake.  Love this record/CD!  Loved this band!
B00992CF6W|5.0|stop complaining about the kindle edition because its behind. you have to know the technology behind these games. ios and phones have prossesors that are stronger than the kindle. its not that your not important. if they did the update on it as is than it would be lagy as hell.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|the game has improved. the turns are slow and when you jump its also delayed. the effects makes it seem 3D but it hurts my head. so this game is terrible in other words. I don't recommend getting this app.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|Like the first book, Cat continues on kicking vampires butts. I enjoyed reading more about Bones history and his relationship with Cat.<br />Fun, exciting read. I would recommend this book!
B0087JTAKW|3.0|I chose this rating because, at times, the dialogue seemed to get bogged down or slow....had trouble coming back each time to continue reading.  I've read 'Tuesdays...' 'Five people ...'  This one didn't capture me as much.....
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|If you liked the movie Seven you will love this show!  It's the same concept with continual surprises at every turn.  Keeps the suspense going
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|I know thats a big statement, but as an avid gamer I simply enjoyed every minute of this film! Characters were great, story, dialouge... there is siimply nothing not to like about this movie! Each world is unique and helps the movie never grow stale or boring. Can't wait for Wreck it Ralph 2! They have set themselves up for a good long series of movies.
B002WJI65S|5.0|My grandson is wild about his 'Mario puppets'  (because boys do not have dolls, of course).<br /><br />Great price...free shipping (Amazon Prime)...and timely delivery.  And Goomba is my personal favorite, too!.
B000000993|4.0|I couldn't find many of the songs done by this group individually on iTunes, so I bought the whole CD and have been quite pleased with my decision to do so.
1400069289|5.0|This book was great for getting an understanding of how habits can form and change. The practical questions of how to change specific habits are left to the reader.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I got this game more for my niece and nephews when we travel together.  As I got further and further up the levels, I play it less and less.  Maybe I'm too old, but I'll let my younger kin-folk bother getting high scores and higher levels.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i love this game it is the best game in the world and im just saying this if  u have heard of eden its much better and this is for all you suckers
B004MC8CA2|3.0|There are better versions out there, but for quick easy access to scripture it's fine.  For deep theological insights and furthering growth in ones spirituality...spend a couple bucks and get a better app.
1616550414|5.0|This book has pretty good quality put into it, it contains great concept art and whatnot from the series. I recommend it for all Zelda fans!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I must play at least a three games a day.  I love the game enough that I'm not going to complain about the fact I have won every two-suited game and checked off &#34;don't show this to me again&#34; every time and it still comes up every time I win.
B00APUQH0W|2.0|The trouble with the curve was simply the &#34;trouble with the curve&#34;.  Not much meat but a lot of potatoes.  Clint should have retired years ago.  But, when he can pocket several million for not much meat, the question is why not?
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Giving us the technology to carry entire libraries of knowledge and volumes of entertainment effortlessly any time and anywhere we want to go!  Of course I love it!
0316056898|5.0|Bought the book because I am in love with Tina Fey.<br />Didn't really expect much about it, but I was so hooked onto the book and didn't let go of it for hours!<br />There's a cute chart in it to illustrate some funny stuff!
B009YMNVMO|5.0|Kids have watched it lots of times.  Nice movie for young children.  The music is catchy and they sing it over and over.
B000KRMZA6|3.0|When I put it in my DVD player it said the content could not be played, or something like it is incompatible with the DVD player. Luckily my Mac was able t play it if I changed some settings around (and by settings I mean change the location). The movie is great of course! I kept watching it again and again until I basically had it memorized.
B00AESN8XY|3.0|Although the premise of the game is macabre (kill all humanity), I found this game to be interesting and challenging.  I am bored with hidden object games and don't enjoy games of the &#34;shoot-em-up&#34; variety.  I really like games that challenge your problem solving abilities, especially games like Lost City and The Secret of Grisly Manor.  This game is one I enjoy spending time with.
B005J9ZFQG|3.0|I don't own the DVD of this movie but I've had Evil Dead 2 on VHS since the early 90's,I think I bought it at a Reel Collections or Suncoast(one of those overpriced movie stores)you typically see in the mall.There's alot of gore and interesting paranormal events that occur,the demons are well created,good effects,humor varies from actually funny and drops to the level of a three stooge's episode.Bruce Campbell's just playing his role but his character rubs off as a real douchebag which is present in Army of Darkness as well.Campbell's character (Ash) is supposed to be tacky hero type but he's just real annoying,you'd expect him to call his arms 'his guns' and talk to his pecs everytime he kills a demon...it's emberassing that there's some guys that have this kind of personality.Is Evil Dead 2 worth watching?once in a while I like to see as what I call an somewhat alternative version of the first Evil Dead.I'm not so much a fan of spoilers but in this case if you've seen the first one,you'll notice the rehashed stuff if I point it out to you...<br /><br />*In the first Evil Dead it ends abruptly by the dark spirit getting Ash,yet he's returning to the same cabin as though he's never been there...why?<br /><br />*He's wearing the same get-up as the first one,blue shirt and khaki pants<br /><br />*His girlfriend's name is Linda,I believe his girlfriend in the first one was named Linda.<br /><br />*He gives her the same necklace as his girlfriend in the first movie<br /><br />*Just like in the first one his girlfriend gets possessed,beheaded,buried in the yard,and comes after him.<br /><br />*There's a burial site in the yard and that could be Linda from the first movie or Professor Knoby's grave,but Sam Raimi never created a part of the story to tell of the Professor or if he met his demise...the grave's just there.Being that Ash is brought into the movie as never visited this cabin before what was the point of adding that?<br /><br />*The bridge gets torn to pieces in the first one,so does the sequel<br /><br />*Ash gets possessed in Evil Dead 2 in a similar vein to the first one yet it turns on and off.Instead the demons play mind games with kill him,make his hand come to life and attack him,and even try to kill him.Demons don't kill each other in this movie since they work together and Ash's possession does nothing in the movie...what was the point?Sam Raimi realized he screwed up the ending of the first Evil Dead and just threw this posession in as some off key incident,yeah sure no one remember's how the first one ended.<br /><br />*What makes this a sequel is the necronomicon was burned in the first Evil Dead but the dark spirit still resides in the woods,yet Professor Knoby's daughter found the 'missing pages' from the book.<br /><br />Sam Raimi got pretty creative with the gore and it's a decent horror movie if you can dismiss the idea of remembering the first Evil Dead but the cold reality of it is Sam Raimi was just too lazy to create an actual storyline.3-stars.the first one,so does the sequel<br /><br />*Ash gets possessed in Evil Dead 2 in a similar vein to the first one yet it turns on and off.Instead the demons play mind games with kill him,make his hand come to life and attack him,and even try to kill him.Demons don't kill each other in this movie since they work together and Ash's possession does nothing in the movie...what was the point?Sam Raimi realized he screwed up the ending of the first Evil Dead and just threw this posession in as some off key incident,yeah sure no one remember's how the first one ended.<br /><br />*What makes this a sequel is the necronomicon was burned in the first Evil Dead but the dark spirit still resides in the woods,yet Professor Knoby's daughter found the 'missing pages' from the book.<br /><br />Sam Raimi got pretty creative with the gore and it's a decent horror movie if you can dismiss the idea of remembering the first Evil Dead but the cold reality of it is Sam Raimi was just too lazy to create an actual storyline.3-stars.
B008133MDK|5.0|Benedict Cumberbatch is amazing as Sherlock! The shows are so compelling that you put aside all your devices to pay attention. Real entertainment. :)
B000OLGCI4|5.0|My daughter has been bugging me to find it and has not stopped watching it since it came. Thanks so much
0062014102|4.0|Very interesting book! It's a little heady/intellectual for me to read very far at a time, especially when it's describing the research and theories. Sometimes I have to stop and think about it for awhile then come back to it. I agree with its premise and have wondered about it myself, without knowing how to describe it. I would highly recommend it!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|My favorite and done well. Stan Lee will be proud how motion pictures have brought his comic books to life!
B005D63ICI|5.0|What's  not to love, it Dexter! I wish that it cost less, It's about the same for a month of Showtime, but, Showtime, HBO and the other channels have these great shows, I love to be able to watch them in a roll instantly!<br /><br />UGH! I love this show!
B0000YB7Z8|5.0|Well worth the price ... and a MUST for any Tull fan.  Takes me back to the good old days when music was poetry wrapped in a tune.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I am in my 30's. I have a child that is to young to read these, but I love them! I really, really like them and dont tell people I have read all of Rick Riordan's books. They are so much fun, and honeslty, I want a fun book to relax to.<br /><br />The Characters are great in this series, and there has been a lot of research by the author and the tales of the Greek and Roman Gods. The book is really great for telling the back stories of the Gods, and kids will be able to link up with what they learn in school and the books.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Great as always.  Still have a couple of parts to see.  Nice to watch when I want, as<br />I am not always available on Sundays.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|This had to be the best season so far. I have said that many seasons, but I have to say that I love Julia Stiles and Colin Hanks did a job as well.  I'm looking forward to the next season.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|I didn't watch the first few episodes when Walking Dead first came on, thinking it was going to be another &#34;zombie&#34; show. One night when my husband was watching it, I happened to be in the room and as they say, &#34;the rest is history&#34; I am hooked on this show and for me thats says alot, since I don't watch much TV.<br />If you ever thought that this is just another show, just watch it and you'll see its not!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|One of my favorite King novels to date. I love anything involved with time travel though. He really put a lot of work into this one and you get a lot of that &#34;return to previous novels&#34; flare that King is good at. Absolute must-read if you're a Stephen King fan.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|Had to buy this after my cat decided to eat my old one!<br />I also use it to charge my phone when not charging my Kindle.
1400049628|5.0|I bought this book before the Zombie Craze really started, but now that it's in full swing and nearly oversaturated in our culture, you should probably just pony up the cash and buy this book. It's funny, entertaining, and a good bathroom or airplane read. Double points if you read it in an airplane bathroom.
B0041TM5OU|5.0|Some of the best music in our collection. The vinyl quality is outstanding. Don't think you'll be disappointed with anything about this album. Wife doesn't normally like this kind of jazz music, but she loves this album too.<br /><br />Thanks from the bottom of our hearts for this vinyl release- of one of the greatest music ever released.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|I loved the first two books and was looking forward to the third.  So disappointed in the  ending of a trilogy that started out to be one of the best. The ending of the third book provides no real resolution. I do hope the author will give us a fourth book that will tie up the loose ends. Alex and Lena deserves a better ending than &#34;I will find you.&#34; I can only hope that Divergent will not leave the readers hanging.
B002A9VJ40|5.0|One of the greatest classic movies of all time. The cinematography obviously isn't the best but it is inspiring and motivating.
B00005JN0T|5.0|I believe this DVD will become a classic on down the line.  So many great lines and actions happened in this movie.
0060264306|5.0|This was used from Goodwill and I love buying from them. The book was in like new condition. Just enough pictures to read to my five year old granddaughter and keep her interested. And of course it's Laura Ingalls Wilder!
1558908382|5.0|Already saw this movie and had to have it for my John Cusack collection.  Movie and music in the movie are fantastic.
0740797719|5.0|I read one of the reviews before purchasing this book.  It is deep for me at first, but I am able to understand where the<br />author is starting at and, will be able to take us in understanding & appreciating the essence of creating focusing on Color & Light.  I believe this is one of the more valuable Art learning tools in my library, even thought, I will have to  read & re-read it time & time again.  This subject is fascinating to me & so, so challenging.  KCC
B00064VRHU|5.0|My daughter wanted this DVD when she told her daughter &#34;nobody puts Baby in the corner&#34; and realized she didn't know what she was talking about.  Right away I had to get.
0312430000|5.0|Well written - he makes it easy and enjoyable to read about an important topic. I learned a lot from this book. Highly recommended.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|have not listened to this yet but sure to enjoy! i will purchase more of his works.! the live concert should be goog!
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Written well and has good starting story line will have to get the second book to see what happens. Suspense mystery magic beasts fights omens and love just what I was looking for in this read!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game's it is awesome I just wish some more characters came free cuz then it will be awesome
0066620996|5.0|This book is just amazing! Every hard working entrepreneur has to read this book... A success recipe and inspiration for any successful business driven person!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|My best friend purchased this game on his kindle, and I played it once and couldn't stop. I decided to buy it for my own on my kindle. The second I began playing, I couldn't stop. It is one of my favorite games on my kindle. Best game ever!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love it every kid should have this. It is the best western game to. I love it so much.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|Oh my gosh. I can now finally navigate my kindle fire with speed. This stylus is awesome. Hardly ever touch the wrong item in error. It's wonderful.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Each book just gets better and better! I can't wait to get the last book and see the next adventure Percy and his friends go on!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book was recommended by a friend who said that she couldn't put it down.  That is the truth, you cannot put it down once you have started to read.  I highly recommend reading this book.  It is a real page turner, great story of a family enslaved, and those who enslaved them. Five stars for this book.
B00899F0G8|5.0|Been watching season 1 & 2 on Netflix.  Bought my first season pass on Amazon for 3rd Season.  It stalls several times and I have to go out of the movie and resume.  Quite glitchy and the picture in full screen is blurry.  Better pictures with Netflix.  Is it always this way with Amazon streaming?  Sure is handy to use.
B0063M22QO|3.0|Game status<br />Not complex enough. Not enough puzzles and too many tries allowed. Tiles are good size fairly easy to see.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|While I completely respect those more worthy than myself to offer rather lengthy critical diatribes of this material, I also want to say WTF??? This is still Hendrix, and I will take this \\"crap\\" any day over the vast majority of anything being offered out there that is \\"new\\". Bottom line, this stuff still has the Hendrix soul, imperfections and all - sounds very human to me. I love what I'm hearing and I don't care if it's not up to par; it's Hendrix, and it still rocks me; even if that might mean I don't have as sophisticated an ear as others, well maybe I'm having more fun than you...
B007HACDLK|4.0|Fast paced.  You feel like you are reading todays history.  I don't believe in perfect numbers, so a 4**** to me is as close to perfect as I can get.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I started this book planning not to like it. The third had been my favorite so far and I wanted more of that. After all a glance through the chapter titles pretty clearly said no dragons and no Jon and Ghost, no three eyed crow and far too much King 's Landing. But I closed it feeling that THIS may have been the best. Taken as a whole what a wonderful story Martin is weaving! But this one has something special. In a word.....Bramie!
0062238868|4.0|Chris Kyle was much more than what spoke of in this book. Enjoyed the read and would recommend to those.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Sadly, I bought this book after Chris Kyle was murdered, but I have enjoyed every bit of the read. The author was a modern life, true hero, writing about his life in a very troubled region of the world.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This little program is really nice for lists and other little memos that make life so much easier! Thank you to the developers!
B008FPOIT6|3.0|The buildup was too big for the ending.  With all the technology included, it seemed that the ending would be more significant. Good story, but not as intense as it would seem.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This simple little game should easily meet the needs of a solitate lover. It performed flawlessly on our Kindle 7 HD.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this book because it's the 2nd book of fifty shades of Gray..it's a romantic love story..only for adults...
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Hours and hours of entertainment and variety! It makes those miserable waits in lines and airports flash right by! Thank you to the developers!
B007QXU0ZO|5.0|If I were to join a weird hippie travelling music cult it would be this one. They truly are amazing in everyway possible.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|I love the dialog that goes on between the characters.The solutions to the puzzles are challenging to say the least.
1853262390|5.0|Orlando is one of the funniest books I have ever read. Also I love the gender swapping. The fact that the book is essentially a love letter is also great.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Thank you once again for a great read Mr. Flynn... Always looking forward to another episode of Mitch. Reminds me of the anticipation I experienced while waiting for another of Ludlum's Jason Bourne character... just don't let the Amazon folks push it through their own editing team?!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I feel nostalgic playing this game. It must been 8086 system running msdos last I played it. Still very interesting after all these years :-)
1616550414|5.0|I admit I played almost every game in the Legend of Zelda arena and this histroical book is a great collector's item. After reading this book, I find myself asking the question, \\"When is enough, really enough? Does the Legend of Zelda need to be told again in so many ways?\\" The storyline has already become weaker and further way from the original theme with every new release. I purchased this book to find closure and it was a great 25 years.<br /><br />Eiji Aonuma vision is to \\"rethink\\" the Legend of Zelda and Ken Levine, creator of BioShock, has a really great insight into sequels for games:<br /><br />BioShock<br />\\"Yet when given the chance to make a straightforward sequel to BioShock, Levine declined. gUsually a sequel is 10 new levels, five new monsters, a few new weapons,h he says. gItfs more corporate- driven than creatively driven.h Instead he and his team got busy plotting a complete reinvention of the game. Irrationalfs parent company, Take-Two Interactive, wasnft about to pass on the opportunity to milk a little more money out of BioShock, so different developers made 2010s BioShock 2 (which contained nine new levels and fewer than five new monsters in its single-player campaign).\\"
1455869910|4.0|First of all, like the others, I am a huge John Green fan. His lovable, nerdy characters are quite endearing, and I find myself \\"falling\\" for his fictional characters. I'm not one to fan-girl, so this is really an impressive accomplishment.<br /><br />However, my biggest problem with TFIOS is that the characters were flawless, especially Augustus. Honestly, can anyone who has read this novel tell me a single flaw that he had in his personality? There is no such thing as a flawless person, much less a flawless, cancerous, teenage boy. I'm not saying that having cancer is a flaw, but it often leads to anger and depression due to the disease, and he didn't seem to have either of those).
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I watched this series twice in one week.Not a single dull moment. I 've read the books and this is a marvelous adaptation that keeps the main elements of the story line while condensing them into a 10 episode season. I do wish that HBO would expand the seasons into 12-14 episodes.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I love this CD!!!!! Looks like this will be my go to album for the remainder of the month. It just seems like Bruno only gets better and better with his music. Not much else I can say except that I love the whole album...except for maybe one song
0385535147|4.0|This is what everybody dreams about, isn't it? You do not have to be locked up in prison to dream a life in a Caribbean beach somewhere sprawled out in the sun with your favorite drink in one hand, and three millions nicely tucked away in a bank. Every forty one year old man or woman would love to live a life like that. So here comes our John Grisham with his delicious story about a prisoner who does just that. To make it even more mouth watering, he shames government while doing that, now that's just fun to think of it, isn't it? The plot was pretty predictable which was kind of nice since it makes me feel as if I am smart or something. My knowledge in government administration or legal procedure is such that I did not notice any gaps so absence of research never bothered me. As long as you do not confuse John Grisham to Tolstoy or try to verify his story in our real legal system, you will enjoy this book. Personally, I think he really did not exaggerate or depart that much from the reality.
B00821OX98|5.0|Ever since I saw him in the hit television series, ER, I have been a big fan and the way he acts in the TNT hit drama series is impressive to say the least. along with aliens and humans on the brink of hysteria and extinction, the cast of Falling Skies was so impressive to me that I was hooked from the get go.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|I have always been a fan of most of Adam Sandler's movies. He's produces a thriller, comedy film that's a little scary, but not too scary. It's a movie for the whole family. I highly recommend it!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|It is hard to say more than what's already been said!    The Piano Guys are incredibly talented musicians and quite creative in their arrangements. I love the \\"classical crossover \\" genre of music and their stuff definitely is the creme of the crop in my book.    If you haven't seen them on Youtube, *please* check out some of their songs. Seeing the music made, even once, will make listening to this album an order of magnitude more inspiring. Every time I hear these songs, I have a beautiful mental image in my head of the music being created. Check out Beethoven's 5 Secrets first, if you don't know where to start. [...]
B0091REZMW|4.0|This app is ok for the most part. It tends to be a little wordy but you can skip it. You might miss some information by skipping the narrative, so maybe scan narrative parts when they come around.
B006ZS4G24|5.0|I purchased this product for my granddaughter for Christmas.  She absolutely loves the Lego Friends products!  Wish Lego Friends would design more products, such as a school house!  Recommend their products!!  Pricing could be reduced, tho.
B000BGH2CM|5.0|I saw it 11 years ago and I loved it. Today I watched it again (I bought it 3 months ago on sale here). It was nice to see a time when WWE was still edgy. When John Cena wasn't superman (he even got cheered on MSG), when divas wrestled in bra and panties, where blood was still allowed. It's a nice look back<br /><br />This 3-disc  DVD comes in a standard box instead of the original cardboard folder pack<br /><br />On a side note. Paul Bearer passed away last night. This PPV features him in the return of the Deadman Undertaker. May he rest in peace
B00BNNJHXO|5.0|See above. This album rips. Its all the things you love above soilwork sprinkled over 20 songs. Stop whatever your doing and get it right now.
B0095P3ULC|4.0|Was glad to see this in Amazon picks - good movie, but miss Megan Fox - even though her absence is a result of her own doing.
B0009HLD0K|5.0|OK, ok, ok... so I'm a little biased. I went to IU and even road in the Little 500, so when I say it's &#34;The Best Movie Ever&#34;, it's just my opinion.<br /><br />We would watch this movie over and over back in college (about 15-16 years ago which I think was about 15-16 years after the movie was released). I just bought the DVD and watched it again; I think it ages well. You'd be surprised at how Bloomington and the campus look much the same after 30 years although some things are obviously changed.<br /><br />The movie seems a little dated by now, but it's still a fantastic coming of age story with a ton of charm. I still get goosebumps and a big smile when I hear &#34;The Italians are coming!&#34;
B007HACDLK|5.0|Like all Mitch Rapp stories, i couldn't put this one down.  don't know how Flynn does it, but i already can't wait for the next story. I just know that love will come again for our national hero, and he is our modern day super hero.  love. love l0ve.
B0012UNWJ8|5.0|A must see for chess enthusiasts.  I loved the plot of the story and how it all unfolded.  It was an absolutely wonderful movie.
B00005JMEW|3.0|This is a movie that does not catch. Unfortunately.<br />Here is my rating<br />Uma Thurman: 4/5 Worth watching the movie just for this great actress<br />Story: 2/5 Revenge? sure. unrealistic? plenty. artistic? so so<br />Costumes: 2/5 nothing attractive<br />Acting: 3/5<br />Kill Bill 1 is not worth more than 3/5. I will watch Kill Bill 2 now and find out if it gets better
B004YM6JI2|3.0|When I got the dvd set some of the dvds where not in the case right, about 2 of the disc holders were broke. But they work and it was mailed on time.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Best series finish it with a great ending. Loved the whole series . Wish it was longer. Hope you enjoy it too.
B00A7OIXW6|3.0|There are practically no bonus features here. A short documentary and some deleted scenes.<br /><br />No commentary, no art gallery, no newly made short featuring Ralph and Felix.<br /><br />Thankfully Paperman is included.<br /><br />I think the bonuses are the same on the 4 Disc set... so buy it if you like the movie...but don't expect much more than the movie.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Loved this story.  Truly inspiring young woman.  Change is hard for most people, some can't get past it!  She found a way to rise out of her misery and pain and face reality! Kudos!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It is simple to do what ever task you need, it easy to access and fun to use. all in all 5 out of 5 with no problems!
B0075LTOR2|5.0|It is a sad commentary when Amazon tries to sell this wonderful boxset at the price of over $69.00 and yet is to lazy, or stupid to list the tracks on the 10 cds. I don't know about you, but I am not going to shell out this kind of money and not know whats in this boxset. This is a very common problem on all Amazon sites. I have complained about it in the past but to no avail. Buyers beware. Shame on you Amazon!!!!!
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I finally finished it, but boy, it was a bitch of a read. Not sure if I caught all the threads, therewere many, but the damned thing kept bringing me back, just to find out what would happen next. I think this series has been going on way too long, and is way too convoluted, but I will probably get six, I've come this far.<br /><br />For those who have not yet started, or are on the first book in the series, I recommend watching the HBO series instead.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Who dont love these colorful birds?!<br />We have this plus Rio on every device.<br />Kindle, tablet, 2 cell phones..<br />My four year old loves it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its apsolutly amazing.isn't. it. it deserves five stars.that's right, I said it.5. like seriudly. anyone who dosent like this game is stupid.
B005HSL626|5.0|Yes what a great game to help pass the time!!<br />I love it and we have it on multiple devices!
B004WR125O|1.0|doesn't work well
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I was not sure if the story line was for me. I found the book to be entertaining but did not read 2 or 3.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Frankl's &#34;Man's Seearch For Meaning&#34; has been a favorite of mine for a couple decades. The wisdom imparted in this work can guide a person through any of life's viscissitudes or crises.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I really liked t he book. Very entertaining & kept me reading. I would recommend & will read it again.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|I think this is one of the best posthumous releases n the catalog (1st rays of the new rising sun is my favorite)<br /><br />I see many people complaining that these are NOT new releases. The truth is these versions are new releases. Most of these songs have been released, but with different arrangements, musicians etc. These versions are from takes that have not been released yet. I personally think the selections are amazing. Hendrix plays with fire on all tracks and the arrangements often show sides of Hendrix that are mostly unseen in the mainstream. Check out \\"Let me move you\\" and \\"Easy Blues\\".<br /><br />When buying a posthumous Hendrix release, you really have to remember how short his career was. You can't expect completely brand new songs. If you do, you are in for disappointment.<br /><br />IMO this album is worth every penny that I paid for it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Classic King. Makes you feel like you were back in the 50s and 60s right next to him. Strongly recommend!
B00AHXIC50|4.0|Very good album.  This is coming from someone thats been in the music biz for years.Thanks for a refreshing change Bruno Mars.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I just got my Kindle Fire, and got a couple other games that are okay.  This one is outstanding.  It is SO RELAXING to play it that I forgot things I was stressed about.<br />Imagine playing with a raindrop!  After you complete each puzzle, you can go back and try to better your score.  There is no pressure to do this, no penalty for not doing well.  You just go back and try again if you want.<br />The music and graphics are pleasant and relaxing.<br />I am 62 yrs. old and it is perfect for me.
B003WWZ148|4.0|Love the songs and spontineity! But recording quality leaves somthing to be desired. Guess the price of a prison recording. Still a must have album among Johnny collectors!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book<br /><br />I loved every page of this book every word had me hanging on wanting to read more and more
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game I played this game on my ipad then I told my mom I want to get it my kindle everybody in my family loves this game
B00821OX98|5.0|With high production values, and great acting this show has more than surprised me.  I started watching a bit skeptical, and instead have become totally enthralled with the series.  It feels a bit like Walking Dead, except that it doesn't get too hung up on interpersonal drama and uses encounters with the aliens to keep the plot moving forward.<br /><br />I highly recommend this show for anyone wanting to scratch that post apocalyptic sci-fi itch.  It really is worth your time.
0060853972|5.0|I can't help it - I find myself laughing out loud as I go about listening to this! I am so enamored I also got the kindle version. Unexpectedly funny. Wish I could give it more stars!<br /><br />one example: the four horsemen, ah, horsepersons are dressed in blood red leathers and have Hell's Angels spelled out in rubies on the back of the jackets, and have really big bikes. They run into some nasty, scruffy Hell's Angels in a pub who are appalled that these 'yahoos' dare to wear 'their' names on their jackets.<br /><br />\\"You're Hell's Angels, then?\\" asked Big Ted, sarcastically. If there's one thing real Hell's Angels can't abide, it's weekend bikers.\\"<br /><br />The four strangers nodded.<br /><br />\\"What chapter are you from, then?\\"<br /><br />The Tall Stranger looked at Big Ted. Then he stood up. It was a complicated motion; if the shores of the seas of night had deck chairs, they'd open up something like that. He seemed to be unfolding himself forever. He wore a dark helmet, completely hiding his features. And it was made of that weird plastic, Big Ted noted. Like, you looked in it, and all you could see was your own face.<br /><br />REVELATIONS, he said. CHAPTER SIX.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Written as diary entries, silver linings playbook is an outstanding story of a young man who had lived a troubled life and how one woman changes it
0385474547|5.0|The book was in great condition.  The package came within a reasonable amount of time.  The book was great for my outside reading for my World History class.  I suggest reading it if you're planing to take a trip to a less-developed country in the near future.  It really opened my eyes to what I was going into.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I just love this show. It's engaging and entertaining and keeps you wanting more. If you haven't watched it yet - you should!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I was intrigued by the topic but was surprised to find a real treasure in this book.  Very interesting read and Susan Cain takes me place (Tony Robbins event,  Harvard Business School,  Saddleback Church, etc) I wanted to see and provided a taste of the experience. It is a fascinating and quick paced read.  As an introvert myself,  I found the book empowering.  I also think there was real value to me as a parent and a grandparent, as well as someone who often works with children, to understand that being shy or introverted is not a defect but is at the same time a strength. I really like this book and have recommended it to my friends.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app. is fun for kids ages 6+. My daughter and I both play it and we love it. Yes, we have a real horse, and yes, I muck out her stall. We both enjoy our real horse much more than the app. but the digital horse doesn't spook or step on our toes with 1200 lbs.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I read this with a feeling of constant joy.  This book is sublimely written (by a very talented Australian no less!!), the plot is carefully thought through and the characters are utterly engaging. Easily the best book I've read in a while.  Read it, read it, READ IT!!
B00395ZYVS|5.0|Amazing story that you just can't put down! Story and characters stay with you even after the last page. I didn't want it to end.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Love love love this book !!! I think it was even better then the movie ... So glad I read the book first but there was so much more in the story in the book then the movie ....
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Hard to believe that this pic won Best over Lincoln, Life of Pi, Django Unchained. There's nothing here but action, the usual stuff, presented the usual way. Danger! Someone's going to get KILLED. Clock is ticking. Let's all get going on adrenaline rush, let's run up and down the halls of a high sky rise building, let's yell at one another over phones, especially cell phones, let's slam our heads into desks, pound our fists on tables, let's damn near slug one another. Clock is ticking! Someone innocent is going to DIE if we don't move and move fast. The enemy: walking around with big scarey looking guns. Then the enemy is running with big scarey looking guns. Then we're all in FAST vehicles.... good people running from the bad people... I mean, if I have seen this kind of crap once, I've seen it a dozen times. Might have been exciting once or twice, but now it just bores me.
0670026603|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read.  I don't say that often.  I had the feeling that while the two main characters- Louisa and Will- were changing, so was I.  I will never forget this book.  It is perfect in its unpredictability.  Louisa and Will are characters to die for- I so easily fell for both of them from the start.  And their love story was so real and believable.  It is a heart wrenching book to read but its worth every tear.  I don't think I will be able to pick up another book for a while...
B002OSY2T6|4.0|Bought for my 9 month old for Christmas. Surprise! she still plays with it. Cute toy, she just likes looking in the mirror. Never really used it to crawl along. It is what it is. Won't knock your socks off
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this game it was a lot of fun it wasn't that scary and it finished fast I thought it was gonna be longer but it wasn't but I enjoyed it very much thank you and please bring another one like this game.
B008VVT51U|5.0|It was funny, sad, happy, and inspirational. I would suggest anyone to watch this movie. My mom loved it too.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|It kept my interest to the end which for me indicates a good read. The ending was different and not what I expected.
B004478GNI|5.0|Bought this for my son and he loved it. The price was good and shipping was fast. It was exactly as described and my son had fun putting it together and playing with it. I will buy LEGO's again.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|All I need most of the time. The app has great interface. I remember paying $40 for a stand -alone that didn't look this good.
B0002KZAKS|5.0|Bought this mic for my daughter and she has been using it alot. Great quality for the money and works well. Mic is as described.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Better than Temple Run 2.  Don't have to tilt so it's easier to control.  Everyone in our family loves to play it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is awesome. With the new updates it has become more addictive then before. I play it hours on end.
B009A87ZQU|5.0|The DVD quality and sound is excellent.  I loved everything about it and have watched it more than once.  Worth the money.
0684874350|5.0|The condition was super and it was delivered fast. I love this book so much I couldn't bear not to have it on my shelf as well as my tablet :-)
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Works much better since it has been updated. Bugs of the past have disappeared and the app is more user friendly.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|The book was just another great story told by Christopher Paolini! I can not wait to read the next one.
B0091LS07E|5.0|Alicia keys is  a fantastic musician, singer and songwriter. A recommend for any that is curious about her music. She is incredible
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book had me addicted from the very beginning to the end! Can't wait to finish the trilogy! Great book!
B006OAB3ME|5.0|I bought this for a friend who is still listening to it. Good tunes. I recommend this disc for those that love P McCarthy
B008RJFRTK|5.0|This map app is great on my kindle fire, since the fire does not have a gps or a cell phone connection. This app is used without and internet connection just like a road atlas.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a great app for horse lovers. With lots of fun activites and competitions. Plus it works great on my kindle fire.
B00514HDNW|5.0|A fine well-written book. The 1950's technology is slightly distracting, but the gripping psychological theme -- getting to the nature of humanity itself is what makes this a classic. Watching the Walking Dead you can see its roots reach back to this book among other influences.<br /><br />The ending is particularly satisfying, all the more so for those of us who had no idea it was coming.
B004UJCYYW|5.0|I was so happy to be able to download the full story in French. And I can now read this huge epic holding a light Kindle in my hands. A great story, and so much more to it than in the musical.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect, but this turned out to be one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  Highly recommended!
0071766588|5.0|indeed, the software has a bug in one practice test which makes it crash, but that doesn't make any less helpful and interesting. recommended !
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|WOW, simply WOW. So much raw emotion. The power of survival and overcoming horrible circumstances brought out there instead of hiding it like a taboo the society makes it out to be. Putting the blame back where it should be on the abuser instead of the survivor.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|This 007 is great, second only to Sean Connery! The movie was good, just didn't keep my attention....  Maybe it would play better on the big screen,.
B001DF68MA|5.0|This is a really nice bike seat!  It is perfect to keep your toddler safe and happy!<br />Pros- the dashboard<br />Cons the foot rests, sometimes he does not like them
B00125WAWS|5.0|What a great film. We had black history month groups where I work. We played this movie for the youth, and they loved it. It sparked great conversation.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|The perfect follow-up to  &#34;The Enemy&#34;.  Provides an understanding of Reacher's personality and the &#34;why&#34; of how he plays the game.  He is a man of integrity and would rather shoot himself in the foot than violate is code of honor...and he does!  After reading this episode, you are ready to dig into the books that were written first.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|It would have been 5 Stars if the F word wasn't used so much. People, you can get the story line across without using all this profanity. I will research more carefully next time.
B001NHNG64|5.0|A story that reveals the gullibility of some people in the U.S.  In spite of the way things were five years ago and earlier, their are people who can be led by the nose with inaccurate and devilishly coersive information.  Jack Reacher deals with it in a proactive way that stops the bad guy in his tracks.  There are positive motivations and there are negative motivations for why we do things, but with Reacher's &#34;can do&#34; attitude, we know who will win out, it's the way he gets there that makes a good read.
B00AZL3PBK|2.0|This is not a  good as you think it is in level two world three I can not make the jump because it is to long.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It works well with my kindle. I really think its better than the 1st one. great for everyone.
B00BLGZN1S|5.0|I enjoy war stories. This came fast and new. Just as described in the add. It will be an added plus to my library of war films.
B001N1DPDE|3.0|The BK-2 is very tough, 1/4\\" thick, with 1095 Cro-Van steel, Rockwell approx 58. I like mine, but found the 'grivory' handles a little slick for me, so I got the micarta scales from Ka-Bar and put them on, which helped. As far as hand size, I wear a (L) glove.<br /><br />This knife is not light(@1 lb.) but you can baton and chop wood very well for that one pound of metal.  Mine must have been an odd one, as the edge bevel was not 20 degrees and it had ridges all along the face of the edge - weak grind quality from the factory on this one.  I have now re-profiled it to 20 degrees and now it's cutting better than ever.  Stock sheath is barely adequate (dulls the blade edge going in and out) and doesn't hang well, felt like they skimped on it.  I am looking into a custom bushcraft style leather sheath since I re-profiled it to spec.<br /><br />I was new to outdoor knives and saw the reviews on this knife and bought one thinking the 65 bucks was a great deal.  Add on 40 for the scales, and probably another 100 for a leather sheath, and you could get an amazing knife for that price (a Fallkniven S1 or A1 on Amazon for under $200) with money left over.
B000I9WWCM|5.0|Julia Roberts is one of my favs. I have many of her movies and always enjoy watching her. This is a story that may be how it really is for people in show business. I liked it.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Parts of the movie were awesome!  It kinda lost me at the ending-but was good, funny, and an over-all good Sy-Fy movie.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|This had a very believable story. The interaction between the 2 main characters was great. I have recommended this movie to friends.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|If you have self-published your own print version and want to convert it to Kindle, this easy step-by-step book will help you do that. However, there are some bugs with the kindle software you may run into and this book does not troubleshoot. You'll have to work out the bugs yourself. For example: if you put a poem on the original kindle, the kindle will want to put hanging indents in the first paragraph at the top of each page, which ruins the look of the poem if you have it tabbed over. I had to put my poems flat against the left margin to avoid this problem. This book does not address these issues. From Erren Grey Wolf, author of Beneath the Surface: The Lost Boy.
B007UXT6T6|2.0|It looks like the more M:I movies there are to this franchise, the worse they are. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
B0065CCM76|5.0|Sound quality is awesome compared to my old rips.  If you're a fan, this is a must DL for your playlist.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|This movie wasn't as powerful as I thought it would be. It didn't seem too realistic. This wasn't one of Denzel Washington's better movies.
0062238868|4.0|Great story by a true American Patriot.  The writing style was a little rough, but it was very detailed.  You felt like you were actually in the battle situations.
B0088WGBC8|4.0|I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. There's alot of action. The storyline doesn't get bogged down. This is another movie I recommended to friends.
B0043D2L9S|5.0|I bought this to go with the Technical belt. The combo is perfect. Customise the setup for just what you need to carry today. If you have a shoot where you have to carry everything including the kitchen sink but don't want to lug a huge sholder bag and a backpack is too inconvienent this is the setup for you. I have hiked 20 miles with 20 lbs of equipment without a backache and at my age thats saying something.<br />It also comes with extra straps to convert any lowepro sholder bag or backpack into a backpack for the harness which is a great option I have used a few times.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This was an enjoyable read. Surprisingly, it was as enjoyable to read as the first book in the series, The Hunger Games.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Very very very very very very good!!!! I love this book!!! You have t o read it. Sure, it's a little sad but super good at the end!!!! It really shows how people that look or have a disability feel like, when people stare at them or point, it shows how they feel. I'm glad it shows people what their lives are like because then people will try to be their friend or help them when needed. So I rate this book five stars because it teaches a very good lesson!!!
B00BNNJHXO|5.0|First I was impressed with the fact it was a double album.  It occurred to me they might be using it as an excuse to dump old b-sides on us and call it new.  Oh, how wrong I was.  This is the kinda album of you have trouble getting out of the car from.  You don't want to turn it off.  It reminds you that Soilwork can bring it.  Like Stabbing the Drama and Natural Burn Chaos.  The Living Infinite gives you polished, mature and challenging material.  At first it seems like an extension of The Panic Broadcast, which would be awesome!  It then develops into more.  The Living Infinite is an album you will analyze and jam weeks before your ready to give your ears a break.
B000784WMW|5.0|IMO, this is the best version of Jane Eyre - Timothy Dalton is first rate as Rochester and the script is true to the novel.  This is a movie I will watch many times over.
B00942S4OY|5.0|My daughter loves it. She was sooo happy she got it. She listens to it all the time. She knows most of the words to each song.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was a good book and a good ending they should have made it better by haveing a better ending
0689853637|5.0|This is the most beautiful book you'll ever own. Several pop-up nature scenes illustrate a simple story of nature in winter.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|I gave this DVD a 5 stars rating because it really keeps you guessing all the way through the series. I can hardly wait for the next season.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|What an amazing story of love, tolerance, strength, acceptance.  Heartbreaking and uplifting.  Every tween should read this.  Asking yourself &#34;who would I be in this story?&#34; would be a wonderful exercise for a reader of ANY age.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|What can I say here, I didn't like this book as much as the other two. Katniss, seemed different to me. I know she has been through a lot. But I still didn't expect that reaction from her. It still held my interest, but I was disappointed in certain aspects of the book.
B004VSTP4Y|4.0|Seriously?!  After three wonderful volumes, THAT'S the ending we get?!?!  It's not how the author ended the STORY that's the problem, it's HOW the author ended the story!  That is: abruptly, as if she came to the end of the storyline and thought &#34;I'm done,&#34; and then just wrote down the fastest &#34;here's what happens now&#34; ending she could think of.  Never mind that she leaves her readers emotionally hanging.  My 15-year-old daughter had the same reaction (and I purposely didn't say a word about my reaction when I finished it, because I didn't want to influence her experience.  VERY frustrating and disappointing.
B007SGM084|3.0|Not a bad read. Im not really the romance novel type, but I do read ever so often. And I wanted to see what the hype was about with these books. Some stuff was pretty expected in way of a plot. Some stuff was eye rolling. But in terms of the romance aspect, and the twist from normal romance books, it was good. It held my interest through three books. If you loved twilight and don't mind a bit of kinkiness, you should like this series as well too.
B003NHRGSQ|4.0|Wasn't sure about the new narrators at first, but think they added to it.  Looking forward to the concluding volume.
B003K16P3M|3.0|The plot though was still very intriguing and it was not bad. For a debut novel it was very well done. Her second book was better. Cashore is learning and becoming a better writer. The plot is about a woman named Katsa who apparently has the Grace of killing. She started a group to help people in meed called the Council. That she does with out her Uncle King Randa finding out. King Randa uses her as a bully/assassin when the need arises. As the council she saves a kidnapped Lienid prince and ends up running into Po the granson and another Lienid prince. These two end up traveling together to find out the truth about the kidnapping. The truth they find is terrifying and unbelievable.<br /><br />The characters were the best part of the book. Each was unique in their own way just like in real life. Each grew and changed and lived. I loved how deep and realistic the characters seemed. I also love how this part of her writing flows into her other books too. Overall the book was good but not great. Still can't wait to read Bitterblue because Fire was a great book.
B001J1S4F2|4.0|This is a pretty well done film, I enjoyed Glen Close's performance the most. This story in itself is quite interesting.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great second book in this series. In this book Ana and Christian find what kind of relationship works for both of them. They grow and change and they find out more than they want to about each other. We finally find out about Christian's past and we meet Dr. Flynn. Christian also finally realizes he has people that loves him unconditionally which he thought he never had. This book is romantic and makes you giggle and smile and gasp, and cry right along with the characters. I love Christian and Ana and I give kudos to Ana for staying with him even after everything she has found out. She hasn't run for the hills. Great plot. Beautiful and bittersweet love story. Great read. Recommend.
B003TSEL7S|1.0|Worst book I've read since  I<br /> was 2.  Never read this poopy book unless your a toilet bc it stinks!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|One of the best romance novels I have ever read. The relationship is passionate, mind consuming, and beautiful. But like every relationship it has it's problems. In this case Christian Grey has a penchant for being a Dominant and Anastasia Steele is a virgin and has no experience and could never be a Submissive. Their obvious differences both bring them together and pull them apart. Can they overcome their differences enough to make it work or will their relationship be doomed.<br /><br />I love Anastasia. She is a strong woman who doesn't let people walk all over her. That being said she still has self-esteem issues. She has a flaws and is so cute you can't help but love her. Christian on the other hand is gorgeous, wealthy, and has a cold exterior but you latter find out that underneath he is scared, alone, and soft. The question is can he overcome his past enough to find love or will he wallow in his past and chase Anastasia away.<br /><br />Great love story. Explicit and well written sex scenes that make you melt. Love scenes and dates that make you want love like that and hardships that are realistic. This book was incredible. Can't wait to read the rest of the series.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|This is a straight forward perfect sudoku game.<br />Nothing extra to get in the way, this game is a true gem.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think this game is amazing. It is fun and addicting. I cant stop playing it. I'm 17 and I love it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its so fun and addicting!! Best game ever!! It doesnt screw up when i play either unlike all my other apps. I recommend this app to people who dont want screwed up apps and want fun, addicting games.
B004E2XAFW|5.0|I am not a fan of Within Temptation (WT) - however - after purchasing this CD based on a positive review from Melodicrock.com, I have to say that I am very pleased! I would describe this project as Night Wish Lite. It has the same sort of vibe to it with out being quite so bombastic, heavy, gnarly, etc. which are all good things for &#34;metal&#34; of any sort.  After purchasing this album I went backwards a bit and bought a previous album by WT that I did NOT enjoy. The singer was pensive and the range of the music caused her to constantly move in and out of falsetto which became rather annoying. On this project she tares it up!  The musicianship is wonderful, the songs epic and soaring. I get chills when I listen to it; makes me feel like an eagle soaring above all the 'crap'... and its kid friendly! Great message. I get the feeling that this is a huge departure from the direction in which WT began.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My girls love this movie and the price at the time was just right!  I would order again if need be.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|3-year old loves the TinkerBell movies which means I watch them a lot, too. This one is my favorite (Based on my scale rating the painfulness of re-watching kids' cartoons over and over).
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Breaking dawn kept me on the edge if my seat. With adventure, surprise, and romance. I recommend this book because it's for all ages preteens, teens, and adults
B0007MWZEK|4.0|I does the job that we wanted it to do, in that it sweeps our hard wood floor prior to wet moping!<br />It does that job easier than using the heavier vacuum cleaner, which is why we bought it.<br />The battery should have a charging indicator light. (I will buy one if it becomes available)<br />The fact that the brushes go in all directions is a major plus.<br />Over all we like the product but it is lightly built and I do not expect to last forever, so I am looking for a more robust unit with the same features, to replace it when it wears out.<br />H Spruit
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I have always  loved James Bond movies.  This one I enjoyed as well.  Daniel Craig is a great James Bond.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|Loved it. Beautiful story!! Laughed and cried and laughed some more. A very quick read that will warm your heart.

B006YG9HJE|5.0|Gift for my daughter. She Loves the series. Great video quality and sound. Worth the money especially when my daughter is happy
B006LSZECO|4.0|Intriguing characters make this a page turner. A story of intense love and hate  The ending leaves u with a feeling of dispair.
0762445262|5.0|It is small, smaller than I thought it would be but that's all right. It projects very well for it's size(clear up to about two to three feet away from wall). My kids love it and it's the coolest nightlight for them. It arrived in a timely manner, nothing to complain about.
B0049985XW|5.0|Love the DVD - great print. Arrived very quickly- March 4th when Ordered on March 1st - how did you do that? The envelope was ripped open on the side - completely - but the videos were inside and the packing list. Post Office? Yes I think so.<br />This is a great print and really not a problem occurred watching it. Very glad to have it. Thank you.
B00AOEA22I|3.0|The debut 3+ years ago is a tough act to follow as \\"Rise Up\\" is no , but it's not a knock out either IMO. The (2009) S/T debut had enough weight with tracks like \\"Invincible\\" to classify that one as a solid MHR release. I would call 'Rise up' a little more light weight and a step down in quality of song writing from their debut. I don't hear the same magic as when listening to the debut for the first time before I was W.E.T. behind the ears. Martensson delivers some lead as well as background vox, as JSS and Erik trade off lead vocals on \\"Learn To Live Again\\". This is a good album, but a little over hyped, with reviews for example by melodicrock.com rating \\"Learn To Live Again\\" 105/100. That's like when your high school gym teacher asks you for that 110% effort (more bark then bite).
B00B7G3Y4U|3.0|Definitely the lamest of the Paranormal Activity movies in my opinion.  If you want the &#34;closure&#34; having seen the others, then go ahead and rent it.  I don't think it was worth the $4 rent - if I could, I would have waited until it got to the $1-2 range or even better, free.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|The story is enjoyable and the characters are well described.  The book suffers from improper editing but is otherwise quite a nice read.  I read the first three books in the series.  I am waiting for the fourth book to be available for Kindle.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|In my opinion: can't say it was the most awesomest batman movie ever like some have.  It was enjoyable.  Held my attention.  Honestly, I really felt like it dragged in a few areas...quite badly actually in some.  Worth the rental price.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Best show ever. Period. Need I say more??apparently I do..watch it ... You will not be disappointed!! Wonderful,performances by the whole cast
1451695195|3.0|Because medical science is resistant or unwilling to believe, as he was, this book will give you the scientific proof. And if you need that, that's great, then it's the book for you and it's well written. However, I already believe and have enjoyed the book \\"Embraced By The Light\\" by Bettie J. Eadie, the 1995 movie \\"Saved By The Light\\" with Eric Roberts, and the book \\"Life on the Other Side\\" by Sylvia Brown because it concurs with what people who've had NDE's have explained. I once gave a copy of Sylvia Brown's book to a woman who had lost her teenage son and she said it gave her great peace. His worm eye view thing reminds me more of when they're walking in hell in the movie \\"What Dreams May Come.\\"<br /><br />We are asked to have faith and believe in God without seeing Him and I do, so I don't care about data. I just want to know more about heaven, and those parts, although not as vast in his book as I would have liked, are parts I do enjoy. Yet, many people want proof, and that's probably why God chose him (a neurosurgeon - how perfect is that?) to have this experience in order to fulfill that purpose.<br /><br />If I needed proof I would have rated it 5 stars. I purchased it because it was highly recommended and I love to read about heaven and although I knew it would include scientific data I thought there would be more details on heaven. He could have written much less about his family and more about his experiences in heaven, and still have included all the data he wanted.<br /><br />Incase Eben ever reads this; people are hospitable from all parts of the country. I couldn't believe you wrote: \\"Without my willing them to do so, my deeply ingrained southern social graces kicked in.\\" and you went on to say how you asked about her husband. Really? You think only people in your part of the country have those social graces? You're suppose to be uniting people not dividing them. It's like saying people where you live are royalty and have social graces and the rest of us are peasants. We are all royalty, and you better than anyone should know that from your experience.f us are peasants. We are all royalty, and you better than anyone should know that from your experience.

1400064287|4.0|A stretch for a 4 star but it was a reasonably good attempt at teaching us why some ideas stick. It just lacked the details and practical depth I was hoping to learn.<br /><br />The Amazon reviews of this book ascribe the authors' inspiration to Malcolm Gladwell's \\"The Tipping Point\\", a book I enjoyed immensely with the journeys into the human psyche - memory, emotion, decision, and behavior. I was sorely disappointed that I did not find any such parallels in \\"Made to Stick\\".  Nonetheless, I think the authors attempt and do succeed at writing a book that is beyond an average business book, as it shows us how to use stories and anecdotes and real life scenarios to make our ideas intriguing and lasting in the eyes of others.<br /><br />The reading style is simple and characteristic of a good standard business book. The material is generally abstract, with relevant case studies and examples woven in. This will not be the most unforgettable business book or the most enjoyable one to read but it is also not a bad read. The chapters are organized remarkably well for the subject matter, and the authors carefully take us through the six major qualities of what they claim makes an idea stick:<br /><br />Simplicity: Strip your Idea down to the very core.<br />Unexpectedness: Your Idea must be new; it must vary from preconceived notions of similar ideas.<br />Concreteness: Use practical stories and real world applications to explain your Idea.<br />Credibility: You as the owner of the idea must be or develop credibility as a person.<br />Emotion: Appeal to emotion as you articulate your idea. It often makes people act.<br />Stories: Telling the Idea in a story will captivate people.<br /><br />While the book presents the six qualities through examples and case studies,  it does not delve into ways to make your own ideas \\"stick\\" - From a historical and anecdotal perspective, it is well-researched and smartly written.  From practicality standpoint, I would have liked to see examples of the authors taking average ideas, and turning them into intriguing ones using a clear approach. All in all, a quick and good read.ples of the authors taking average ideas, and turning them into intriguing ones using a clear approach. All in all, a quick and good read.
B008FPZQQU|5.0|The original recording is still awesome but the extras are really worth listening to. Having heard stories on how some of the songs were developed, it was great to hear alternate version to help make those stories more tangible.
0140157352|5.0|\\"Getting to Yes\\" is quite possibly one of the best negotiation books you will ever read. First published in 1981, the authors founded the first Negotiation Program at Harvard Law School and have been successfully teaching their negotiation technique globally. I enrolled in a one-day course at my company. The course teaches the fundamentals of the book. It was an excellent class taught by two lawyers.  The instructors talked about Roger Fisher as the most prominent author of this book; he is well sought-after by corporations and institutions for arriving at the best results in the most difficult negotiations.<br /><br />You will be hard pressed to find a simpler, more practical, more sensible and change inspiring approach to negotiation and communication than the techniques of Fisher and Ury. The main principle is simple: \\"Do not bargain over positions. Bargain over interests.\\" Positional bargaining might serve us well in some instances, such as when haggling in a market over the price of goods. The techniques in this book are aimed at the type of negotiations in business and life where we have vested interest in the relationships of those we negotiate with.<br /><br />Bargaining over positions will hardly gain the desirable outcome in any other situation. It can cause bitterness if we are too soft for not pursuing what we really wanted, and regret if we are too hard on the other side, for taking them for all we can. In response to whether we should be soft or hard, Fisher & Ury respond that you should be neither, and when you bargain over interests, you do not need to choose to become one or the other. The negotiation takes on a completely different angle. It will no longer be combative, and both parties will try to reach the right outcome.<br /><br />The Methods you learn:<br />-Separate the People from the problem<br />-Focus on Interests, Not Positions<br />-Invent Options for Mutual Gain<br />-Insist on Using Objective Criteria<br /><br />I have USED and practiced these techniques and have had so much more success in my negotiations. One of the books that has taken my negotiation to the next level and well, it might just do that for you! :)ed these techniques and have had so much more success in my negotiations.

B008FPZQRO|5.0|Tarkus is one of my all time favorites so I may be a little biased. I probably have 4 other versions of this recording yet this new one is special. The enhanced quality of the original recording is awesome and rivals that of the Gold Disk version from a staging perspective. The extra recordings of alternate versions were also very interesting. You can actually hear ELP toying with making Tarkus a more guitar-intensive recording and can almost imagine the studio discussions.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Everyone should watch this documentary (Everyone who cares about their health and what they put into their body). Nice Documentary.
B0058YPL66|5.0|It's everything I want in a tv series and then some. Great stories, great cast great costumes great everything else. Just wonderful stuff I can't put into words because there's too much going on. A special \\"thank you!\\"  to Lana Parrilla and Robert Carlyle for having a blast and making that visible to us all.<br /> It's worth it to buy the DVDs because you'll need to watch every episode at least three or four times to get all the nuances and little hints for future reference. Enjoy!

B002GYI9C4|5.0|Wow. I'll start with that. Wow.<br /><br />There is just something about a good, or great, fantasy that gets me really excited.  Sanderson exquisitely delivers some incredible world building skills in the first installment of the Mistborn series. I was thoroughly transported into Luthadel during each read.<br /><br />I loved Vin. Actually, I disliked much about her but I think her small character flaws made me love her even more.  She starts off so quiet and small and ends up as this bigger than life young woman ready to take on so much.  Maybe not everything, but still so so much.<br /><br />All the characters were wonderful and each so richly distinct. Some caring and humorous, some snobby and cruel, others all too arrogant but all were interesting.<br /><br />  &#34;You should try not to talk so much, friend. You'll sound far less stupid that way..&#34;<br /><br />Beneath a wealth of wonderful world building and amazing character development is an outstanding story.  It's not just a tale of a young girl's journey to becoming a hero.  It is that, of course. But there is so much more. It's a tale of friendship and love and lost love and pain and oppression and religion and oh hell, so much.  There are some very endearing moments followed promptly by some epic fights, then some profound learning experience.<br /><br />  &#34;Belief isn't simply a thing for fair times and bright days...What is belief - what is faith - if you don't continue in it after failure?...Anyone can believe in someone, or something that always succeeds...But failure...ah, now, that is hard to believe in, certainly and truly. Difficult enough to have value. Sometimes we just have to wait long enough...then we find out why exactly it was that we kept believing...There's always another secret.&#34;<br /><br />I won't spend much time going into too many of the details, this is a large book. A 26+ hour audio. Needless to say, we would be here all day if I gave a thorough synopsis.  However, for any fantasy lover it is well worth the time spent. There is a new take on magic that blew my mind, it involves metals and is so exquisitely developed that I actually feel smarter for having read it. Yes, I'm a dork - what? There were action scenes and plot twists that stole my breath, and just a sprinkle of a heart tingling romance...what more could you ask for?  Brandon Sanderson is to younger readers what George R.R. Martin is to adult readers, a master of fantasy.fantasy lover it is well worth the time spent.

0062014536|4.0|DELIRIUM was a let down for me. I read it after the dystopian surge had passed, after reading so many dystopians following the same vein DELIRIUM did, which is why I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would.<br /><br />  Then there was PANDEMONIUM, which took the dystopian skeleton of DELIRIUM and wove muscles around the plain bones and layered them with beautiful skin. PANDEMONIUM gave DELIRIUM a personality. Moreover, it gave me a reason to love two-thirds of a trilogy I never thought to love.<br /><br />  And then PANDEMONIUM ended with a painful cliffhanger. No doubt, I had to read REQUIEM. And from page one to page last, I was engulfed in a game that began slowly, easily, with lungs full of air and the sky full of sunshine and soft breeze.<br /><br />  And slowly, things heated. Slowly, slowly. The story passed easily between Lena and Hana, Hana and Lena. The passing became a flickering ricochet, the story moved faster. The lungs heaved, begged for air. The sky was full of smoke.<br /><br />  Everything exploded, worlds collided, hearts broke, bodies fell and words healed. Words, words, words. Beautiful words strung in beautiful sentences, powerful enough to rivet and grasp two eyes in an iron fist.<br /><br />  And finally, REQUIEM ended.<br /><br />  It was a vague, beautiful ending. One that leaves a future in the hands of the reader. One that leaves you content and worried and wondering and countless other things at once.

Helen Hunt did a wonderful job as the sex therapist and John Hawks was so funny and candid even in his crippled state. Even tho a person is handicapped or developmentally challenged, they to, have needs and wants and can be capable of having a sexual relationship with another person.This movie should have won more awards than what it did. This is a must see for all adults.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|What a great game to past time! These subway surfers are so much fun and they more quickly as the police officer chases them. I got the hang of the game in no time, and play it almost nightly before I get to bed. Great game!
B00BESLHEA|1.0|Very disappointing for a movie with Tarantino's name connected to it and some outstanding actors. I quit watching after the first 30 minutes.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Fits perfectly, works perfectly, looks very attractive and well tailored. I am very pleased with this purchase! You really don't need to get the leather case for an arm and a leg. This case looks great, and does the job well!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I found this movie to be riveting. The story highlights a plane crash and the investigation into the cause(s) afterwards. I don't want to give too much away, but suffice it to say, you can look at the movie as either an action film with amazing character development or a character study with an awful lot going on in the background. Either way, the acting, the script and the cimetography are all top notch. Add a great soundtrack and a very realistic yet insightful look at a common but tragic and poorly understood affliction and you have a phenomenal movie.
B006QS0PF0|4.0|I actually didn't know of Portia De Rossi until a couple of years ago, and then just because she was with Ellen. I had never seen Ally McBeal or anything that she was in. If anyone did think she was just another famous, beautiful celebrity who hooked up with a famous lesbian for a while, this book blows that notion out of the water. I feel fairly certain that Portia's willingness to be brutally, searingly honest about every demon in her life is not shared by most other celebrities. I have commented though that while this work is a front row seat to the hell people can create for themselves via anorexia, that is not the premise of the book, IMO. I feel that the premise of the book is Portia's complete lack of self esteem and feeling as though she didn't deserve to take up space on this earth. I also want to add in regard to comments that this is in alot of ways a \\"how to\\" book for anorexics, that first off, all Portia spoke of was not eating, using laxatives and overexercising, hardly unheard of in the world of eating disorders, pretty basic stuff, and there is far more out there that does coldheartedly promote such behavior, other than this book.  There are many ways to be self destructive and anorexia/bulimia are just two of them. This was a journey through her mental illness to the other side of accepting herself as she is and who she is, and to that end, anyone could benefit by reading this book. I felt it was well written and deeply felt. I have the hard copy but am also going to listen to it on CD as she reads it. I still don't know if she is a good actress, but I feel sure that she is loving and giving and real, a beautiful woman inside and out, with a strong message of hope for those struggling with being gay or lesbian and/or accepting themselves in all ways. I think the world would have lost someone special had she died. \\"Special\\" is not how most celebrities can be described. I think it's kind of ironic that she was the starving one on Ally McBeal when Calista Flockheart looked super anorexic, and completely unattractive, from the first minute.    There were a few problems that I had though, which is why I gave it four stars. While Portia was totally honest with her pain and craziness, for some reason she didn't go into her recovery much at all, and indeed glossed over it. I can only imagine how horribly painful it was for her, who felt upon reaching her lowest weight, but at death's door, that she had finally succeeded at a diet, proving her professionalism and strength, to have to watch the weight coming back on and on and on. How did she deal with being at the end, the embodiment of her worst nightmares, at her heaviest weight? How did she deal with all of her issues, both with her weight and identity? How did she reach her healthy weight and be able to stop? What was her life like? Fast forwarding to hers and Ellen's wedding day wasn't enough at all.    The other thing that really made me wonder, and also feel sorry about, was the apparent complete lack of parenting Portia seemed to have from the age of 12 on, or maybe even before that. I didn't pick up on any feelings about her father other than feeling loved, however the feeling of abandonment must have been great, and she said she had never dealt with those feelings.  I can imagine that her mother could feel overwhelmed, becoming a single parent, but when I read of Portia's account of modeling agents demanding to see her rear end without clothes, because \\"the shoot was going to focus on her rear end,\\" and then critiquing it, and then taking photos that make her \\"look thirty\\" as Ellen said, I just think, \\"where the hell was your mother? Why isn't she protecting you, and PARENTING you?\\" It turns out that where her mother is is giving her dieting tips and turning blind eyes to Portia's beginning to abuse herself, physically and emotionally, with food. She was 12, and needed someone to protect her, to say \\"no, you aren't going to make my child feel like s*** or demand that she weigh 50 pounds, or scrutinize her nude body like she is a piece of meat. She's a CHILD.\\" For a parent to allow that is perverse! I am wondering if Portia didn't take over the family financial caretaker role, in some capacity, and so her mother went along with it, and bowed out as the parent. I just can't believe that modeling agencies are as soulless as show business venues, that don't see children as vulnerable human beings, but just objects to make money,and get away with it.  Parents are wrong for putting their children into these meat grinders.    I am so happy that Portia is so happy now, and feels comfortable in her own skin for the first time in her life. I saw a recent video clip of her on Ellen for her 40th birthday and she looked really really thin though. I really hope she is still doing and feeling well.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|A friend of mine loaned me the PC version of this game, and it was a lot of fun.  I was very excited to see this as an Android App and downloaded it.  This is basically Bejeweled, however part of the game is to get certain items to fall off the bottom of the screen so that you can &#34;collect&#34; items you need to get to other countries on your trip around the world.  It's fun, and sometimes quite challenging!  I don't think I would try this on my phone, but it works well on my Samsung Galaxy 2 7-inch.
B003U0I9U0|4.0|To be honest, I hardly paid any attention to a-ha for almost 20 years.<br />And all of a sudden, one thing lead to another, I was drawn back to them realizing they no longer were.<br />What a nostalgic bitter sweetness I felt with old and &#34;new songs&#34; I knew and never knew.
0452289963|5.0|It's been a few years since I've read this book but as the title says, it'll open your eyes.  Great motivational book.
B00AJLHUA8|4.0|I recently rented this movie, just out of a sudden interest. I came to watch it without any exception and experienced a sleepless night afterwards.<br /><br />I want to say that this is not an \\"entertaining\\" movie, but rather horrific and chilling. I had not expected the plot turns out the way it did. No form of rationality ever entered in this story. Basically, it's about a writer who's trying to get his 15-minute fame and got his family to move into a house that was previously owned by a deceased family (but his family didn't know that then). The writer (played by Ethan Hawke) has discovered a box full of Super 8 films in the attic, showing a number of families and their deaths, prompt him to investigate the murders and to find out who was the killer. Instead of telling the police of what he really discovered, his own motivation was fame-seeking rather than protecting his family. In the end, what he really wanted to find out, he got with a chilling surprise.<br /><br />Admittedly, this film is pretty original with some expected minor storylines. But, overall, it's a good scary movie. After watching this, I never slept well for a long time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's so much fun and I'm totally addicted! I can't stop playing this game. My 5 year old daughter and I play almost every day together.
B001UV4XWY|4.0|Apparently, this film was based on the 1970 short story \\"Button, Button\\" by Richard Matheson, but I didn't know that at the time when I watched \\"The Box\\" several times in the course of previous several months.<br /><br />It's about a couple (played by Cameron Diaz and James Marsden) who receive a box from a mysterious burnt man (embodied by Frank Langella) who offers them one million dollars if they press the button sealed within the dome on top of the box. But, the catch was, once the button has been pushed, someone, somewhere, unknown to the couple, will die.<br /><br />Personally, this film has kept me involved and intrigued. I was quite fascinated with the enduring plot and a serious question as to what would one do: push the button to receive a million dollar and someone will die or don't push the button. The whole thing seems to be testing one's greed or self-interest in some way. What really got me involved into this film was the fact that it drives home the consequences of our choices in a bizarre plot. But, for some reason, there are a few holes in the whole story that didn't feel right.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it's a good film to watch.
B001P3SA8U|5.0|Very well done movie. The acting is top notch as well as the music. It really captured the feelings of the time.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I love Vince Flynn's book to the point that the rest of the world stops when I begin reading his books.  This book kept me at the end of my seat.  Yet, I am wondering who does the proofing for his books.  There is a character in his book that is an Air Force NCO.  Vince refers to her as a command master sergeant.    Perhaps, the title that Vince was thinking of was chief master sergeant.  Yet, having worked for the Air Force in support of their medical mission, a chief master sergeant is not the person who runs a traumatic brain injury ward.  No, that person is probably a master sergeant or a technical sergeant.    So, Vince, please have your proofers go to this site -- [...].  This could help you for future revisions of your book.
B005N7CA3A|5.0|You can't go wrong with Darren Hayes. I own all of his albums and each is different and it is clear he loves to experiment with different sounds. I highly anticipate each new album and am never disappointed. Amazing voice, beautiful lyrics, Darren always rocks.
B00992CF6W|5.0|BEST GAME EVER!!!! I like Pc better.Otho IT'S AWESOME!!!!!Cause thare's seed's exep thare's no sever's!! and so FUN!!I play so much!
0525478817|5.0|This book is by far one of my favorites, of course all of John Green's nooks are amazing. But The Fault in Our Stars just gave me such a deep connection to the characters unlike any book I've read before. I felt like Augustus and Hazel were my friends and I peering into their life. This books brought out laughs, thoughts, and tears from me. It is truly an AMAZING book and I would recommend it to anyone, except, I feel sort of like Hazel with all of John Green's books and just want them for myself haha
B006OZKX02|2.0|apparently the x-men 1st class disk doesn't play in newer blu ray players. So why buy this? go ahead and buy the X-men Quadrilogy and buy the first class blu ray separately!<br /><br />***UPDATE, they made an adamantium edition X-men set that has even \\"The Wolverine\\" included. better to wait for that
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|Got this for my mother in law. It came fast and she watches it all the time. GREAT prices too.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Sparks does an amazing job at turning a tragedy into a love story and I feel like it could really gives hope to those in a similar situation.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Simply nothing to not like here if you enjoy gorgeous colors and good laughs. And if you were addicted to Donkey Kong and Space Invaders and Asteroids in 1981 like me, then you will be in retro heaven. The concept is pure creativity, the script is tight and the voices are excellent, especially O'Reilly, who is far beyond most voice actors. He really brings Ralph to life. Yet the image quality is what takes center stage.<br /><br />Up was the finest animated blu-ray image I've seen until this, but the deep deep colors and incredibly varied hues here combine with the crazily detailed images to produce eye candy of another dimension, like the recent Speed Racer movie but much finer in every way. The sound is also pristine, total clarity and nice crisp stereo detail.<br /><br />All in all, one of the most non-stop fun toons I've ever seen. The only thing missing was Roger Rabbit! Absolutely recommended in every way, especially if you want to laugh in amazement while seeing just how incredible your flat screen can look. The fact that the movie is so well made is just icing on this sweet sugar rush of a flick.
B004ZN9J0K|4.0|I am a huge Pink Floyd fan and their early work is not common. Found it with Amazon and the entire purchase was worry free and as quick as I could ask for.........then their is the music.....wonderful experience all the way around
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun Game for the family....Good sound, fun, fun, and more fun...Didn't cost us<br />any monies and everyone is happy with the game
B003UPPO2G|5.0|Live concert. It had all my favorite songs.  Very upbeat. It was great to exercize to!  I would recommend it.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|I read reviews while in the middle of reading Requiem so I anticipated a bad ending or lack of ending.  But I actually liked the end.  It left the reader with a feeling of hope.  I would have preferred an epilogue but was okay with it.<br /><br />Although I didn't feel the story flowed well.  Every time I would get really involved in Lena's journey,  the story would switch to Hana.  I found myself paging through the Hana chapters to find out what was going to happen to Lena's group.<br /><br />Overall it is worth the read if you read the first two.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game. Beautiful horses. Lovely graphics. Always keeps you busy. And is the perfect type of game if your like me and love taking care of virtual pets.
B009HNDCC4|5.0|This is my favorite show, I am never tired to watch it. I believe this is how modern families are now days.
B0095G5AFU|1.0|This is the same as regular the notebooks app. SO ANGRY!!! DONOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS!!! I want a refund!!!! I am fuming.
0547884591|4.0|This is an interesting book.  Have spent several hours browing through it, and always find it interesting.  Getting spoiled now, I don't like to lug around a book now that I have my Kindle.  I think that I would enjoy it even more if I had it downloaded onto my Kindle!
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I LOVE this app. It works PERFECTLY!!!!!! Way better than My Binder a similar app. My school offers electronic opitions instead of real notebooks. They recommended My Binder but I found this app. Works AWESOME!!!! It takes a minuets to figure out how to change fonts and themes but after that your good to go! TOTALLY recommend this.<br />If you have any questions and/or comments email me at<br />alisajohnson140@gmail.com
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I read this one very quickly, it started off like a teenage romance, but soon developed into something else, reminded me a bit of Twilight but without the vampires. Nice one!
1611748755|5.0|I really enjoyed this version of the book. The reader was amazing. I always have a book playing in my car but they are not all as good to listen to as this one was.<br /> Thanks for the great price.
B0054SMID0|4.0|Enjoyed the movie. Figured out who did the killing of the investigator. Enjoyed a movie without the main character involved in an extended love affair.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love horses and this game is a lot of fun! Its very realistic as well. Gems are hard to get and I wish there was more free ways to get them but there is still a lot you can do without them. :)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is a fun game! I don't play many games but I like this one it is quit addicting. Pretty surprising.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|it's simple, yes. but a good puzzle game with good graphics and sound to keep a player going. plot your moves wisely..
B00881VLCE|5.0|Really love the challenge without the mess of a real puzzle.  Plus the picture is more beautiful!!  I'm still a beginner so I have lots of room to grow and challenge myself.  Thank you!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Excellent narration voice for NIV version. easy to use and many versions on one app.  Thank you for combining all of them in one place.
1616550414|5.0|First of all, I must to say that buying through amazon is always successful experience. These books arrived in perfect condition and before estimated date... Even I live in Argentina!!<br />From the impression point of view is excellent, a lot of pages full colored, in thick high quality sheets, and hard cover with a exquisite golden finish.<br />The content, according to the general product, is invaluable for most of gamers in their 20s or 30s who knows what are they playing. A lot of information and comments from the original designers, original sketch, art and notes, and the complete and official story of a game... that more than a story... this game have a Legend<br />Lucas Bustos
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn did a great job with creating and filling-out the characters in this story.  It tended to get confusing with the switchback and forth from characters to time frames so needed to pay close attention while reading.  I liked it!
B004I8WD6E|4.0|Decent case. It's cheap and gets the job done, I've had it for over a year. It yellowed a bit but has kept my iphone in great condition. It actually gets compliments too.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This story has so many twists and turns that you will be cross eyes by the end.  It is well worth the read.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game gives me a challenge and it makes me think about what I need to do. I do really enjoy playing it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I reallu enjoy this game! there are so many types of dragons and even without spending a fortune you can expand you dragons island and get a variety of dragons. great game! I would recommend it to anyone.
B00ANVX6DY|3.0|This DVD contains only one episode, the 48 minute premiere episode once upon a princess. Other Disney junior DVDs like Jake and the pirates - jake saves Bucky contain a full length episode PLUS at least 3 additional 22 min episodes. For the price I was expecting the same type of product.  I will hold out for a DVD with more episodes on it.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Got to play this one its a blast! Fun for all but really brings back the memory of playing a similar game on Xbox360!
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|Best movie I've seen in years. I had to watch it three times to grasp what all was happening .<br />I think you would understand it better if you read the book also.
B0012HRJEA|2.0|Although I admire the attempt to &#34;conteomprise&#34; Shakespeare, this effort becomes ridiculous in that attempt. The story is usurped by style and excess, while the actors, for the most part, are forced to eat as much of the scenery as possible. A few rare moments of real substance do exist but they are much too rare.
B000P0J0A6|4.0|I love this movie.  My kids grew up during the 80's and we loved all the movies of that time..  I have add it to my movie library.
0425263916|5.0|Sylvia Day is a wonderful writer!  This series is the only series comparable to Fifty Shades of Grey.  If you read Fifty and are looking for something else to read, pick up this series!
B000P0J09W|5.0|another great movie from the 80,s  Added to my special movie library. I wished that Hollywood would make more movies like this.
0425263908|5.0|Sylvia Day is a wonderful writer!  This series is the only series comparable to Fifty Shades of Grey.  If you read Fifty and are looking for something else to read, pick up this series!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I love the intreage and suspense of what will happen next  I lovethe little man and the part that he plays.
B001QKSWOE|5.0|I feel like I know Stephanie after reading this series and all the in between the numbers books.  I can't wait for the next one to come out.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I love the second season just as much as the first.  I dont think that Ned Stark should have been killed in the first season.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|This app provides hours of entertainment for my son.  He loves it and all the extras like changing out the color of the swipe.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Everyone has their own personal Bond rating system, so I won't waste your time claiming this is &#34;The Best Bond&#34;. I will comment on the quality of the transfer however. I'm not like some of the people who rate blu-rays. I'm not technically savvy, but I am an artist by trade so I lean towards appreciation of certain aspects of film so I'll comment on those. The crisp details are amazing. The colors are rich and absolutely stunning on a good TV. The sound balance seemed better than some blu-rays I've had where the dialog is drowned out by the music. I know you can (and I often have to) adjust the settings on my TV to compensate for that by adjusting the music-to-voice balance, but I appreciate when I can pop the disc in and it just works. I use my PS3 to play blu-rays if that influences my review to you.
B00ARAN9JW|3.0|I liked the move just fine. It really didn't add much to the series for me or any new information. It also did not have the wonderful HD experience for me never it was SD the whole time, and I rented the HD version.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book. It was awesome. This book speaks to the reader. Many people, 13 and up, can and will relate to this. It talks about how drugs are bad and sibling rivalry. I truly recommend this book. It deserves the five stars.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|The Misremembered Man<br />Christina McKenna<br />The story develops on two levels, in two time periods.  The setting of rural Ireland  in the mid 1970's and the light comedy of the naïve Jamie McCloone's attempts to smarten himself up to find a woman  is contrasted with a much darker time and setting - the harsh Catholic orphanages  of Jamie's childhood in the 1930's.<br />The author does a superb job in recreating two quite different atmospheres, contrasting the warmth of Jamie's neighbours Paddy and Rose with the cruelty shown to the \\" children of sin\\" known only by numbers in the orphanage. These children have been so abused psychologically, physically and sexually that as adults, their only  aim is \\" to go through life without causing offense\\".<br />The setting and characters are well developed, and the book itself well worth reading.<br />mlr
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I enjoyed it very good, I enjoy all his books they are always very good. looking forward to seeing the movie.
B008RJFRTK|4.0|Oh, and I wish the font would grow when I zoom in, it's still a bit small for my old eyes. Not a review, but a request for the Dev.
0316228532|5.0|Being a fan of Harry Potter and JK Rowling's writing abilities, I was anxious to read this book.  Although a bit off putting at first, due to language and subject(s) matter, I had to admit that by the end, I was 100% in the author's corner.  Not only does she write with such descriptive imagery, but there is a message there.  One doesn't often realize how one's actions affect others, even if indirectly.  It also shows that bullies do more damage than one can know, as do drugs, and ignorance.  A great character study (as were the Potter books) in all forms of personalities colliding with almost inevitable results.  The audio book is also terrific!
B001BZGA8Y|5.0|WATCH EXCELLENT<br />is an excellent watch I received it in very good condition, excellent brand, buenisimo shipping was fast and I am very happy with the purchase I recommend for that reason I give it 6 stars thank you very much.

B007FEZQF8|5.0|Enjoyed this book. Love the AMC series and heard about the comic books on The Talking Dead. I'm going to get them all.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I can not put this game down.  I love the different levels, in the beginning it seemed pretty easy but as you get up into the levels it gets harder to beat the timer.  Really fast moving game nothing boring about it.  I am of the 60+ age it is good for the brain keeps you thinking.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Not my favorite book. It just has a lot of slow parts. . . . . . . . .
B00AV68GOA|5.0|I cannot wait for the books from the next 2 seasons. Julian's commentary really adds to understanding the characters and time period.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a good app. for people that always wanted a horse but can't afford one. With this game now I have two.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|While I appreciate seeing good actors play age appropriate characters, the plot was thin on this one.  Tommy Lee Jones character seemed to have only one emotion: angry old codger.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A great end to the series, and it keeps you guessing till the end.  Made me mind of sad that this is the end of the series
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Intense and touching autobiography of a great American hero. A must read for anyone interested in what war is really like.

B009IEXKXI|4.0|I would put it down bur always go back to it. It rings of the old problem-solving genre, which<br />I don't run into much at all anymore.

B003JTHXOK|3.0|A modest, uninspired story, but this is a disappointment compared to Spark's beloved classic romance &#34;The Notebook.&#34;  Let's hope Sparks has it in him to produce another great one.  This is not it.

B0063GORYU|5.0|easy to play on the Kindle and always a bit of a challenge. Perfect for a wait in the Doctor's office or in line.
B002VWNID6|1.0|I don't hate the movie, it's one of my favorites. I hate that it quit half way through! Returned it; hope I get a refund!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great. Once you start you can never put it down. Love love love love it. Great game.
1250010403|5.0|Jeffrey Archer is a master story teller! The second book of the series left me wanting the third book to be right next to me so I could pick it up as soon as I finished &#34;The Sins Of The Father&#34;.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Quality television that the US writers have forgotten about or lost. It's tv drama set in post titanic sinking, but deals with issues that are still relevant today. Short season , so take a weekend or a few evenings and enjoy!
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Movie kept freezing-up near the end when things were getting exciting.  Will have to rent it again at some time to get a positive viewing experience.
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|Every time to watch it you find another joke hidden in the dialog.  Can watch it over and over!!  Am going to purchase.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|Loved every mile of this extraordinary journey taken on a whim but with a motivation that was encouraged by all he met on route.The unfolding of the story was very deftly done as there many other stories woven into its fabric  and many lives transformed.I love happy endings and this brought such love and resolution in the end.
B00BEL4P9Q|5.0|I just love this program.  But, losing Matthew was ABSOLUTELY devastating!  I actually am not sure I want to see Season 4, because of Mary's imminent heartbreak.  If only you could bring Matthew back!  This was the perfect love story and I hate seeing it end with him dying.  I will probably not watch the first installment because of the sadness, and heartbreak, for Mary and her father.  Matthew was the son he always wanted.  He became a brother to Tom.  I hate this.  I am having a hard time dealing with the loss.  EVERYONE loved, and adored, Matthew.  Even the dowager!  Grandma-ma will reel from this.  Please, please, make the sadness short lived and move on to a happy time!
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|graphics good. the hint takes a while to recharge. I wish it would have doomed in better.  some items are hard to find.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|I'm old and I watched the Dark Shadows series. I think the people that watched the series, actually relate to it more than the younger generation.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|True story, in his own words, of the greatest sniper in US military history. I bought the book after his tragic death which made reading it very difficult, but I had to hear his story. This book is for people who respect our armed forces and the sacrifices made by them and their families.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Started with swift key on my HTC thunderbolt and didn't like it.  When I got the SG3 I used the default board, swype,  but it started to act up. Figured out this had a new floe and I love it. It has some niches but you learn quick. Highly customizable and it keeps stats.  Since installed a week ago I've flowed over 6500 words. Really enjoy it.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|My kids love it, and I must admit, I have been having a good time playing it myself as well.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Great writing, casting and acting.  Being an old school Holmes fan I was reluctant at first, but Sherlock is a sure-lock.
1616550414|5.0|This book, is amazing  full of story and images from all zelda games, Every Zelda fan should buy this book.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|From the mind of Seth MacFarlane. He has his finger on the pulse of the world's funny bone. He proves it every Sunday.
B003CYKCHW|5.0|I bought this for a song on Woot a few years ago. My MX Revolution was dying and I needed a replacement.    I got lucky and this mouse has lasted me at least two years. It's the most comfortable mouse I've ever used (I have small hands) despite its appearance. The buttons are all placed very ergonomically and feel good. The scroll wheel works but is a definite step down from my MX Revolution.    The software is pretty s***ty looking but works. Once you program it, it's good to go. I love the fact you can change the button assignments.    It's not adjustable, but I've had several friends use it and they loved it.
B006MW3UZW|3.0|I have watched just 2 episodes of Season 2 because I couldn't access further episodes.  Not only that but the picture would freeze and it became annoying.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I hope I spelled that right. Here's what I've gotta say, it's not as good as the first, but to be fair, the first Harry Potter isn't as good as the first. This is still a good book though, and the story certainly picks up neatly after the first one pretty well. There are some forehead slapping moments and alot of thoughtful ones as well. All together a good book.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|This was a mediocre movie, it was congratulatory with respect to the United States freeing hostages, when, in fact, we have the Canadians to thank for their heroism and allegiance to us for pulling it off, although that was understated in the movie. THe editing was disjointed, but the Hollywood scenes and satire on Hollywood was quite funny and fine, Alan Arkin and John Goodman were superb, for the rest of the international scenes, stay home and watch Homeland.<br />Why it won the best picture is beyond me, other than because it was so self congratulatory on America or because it was among some of the most mediocre films made in 012.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Gawd this was a depressing book. There were some good parts, but I think Suzanne ran out of ideas with this finale. The ending is so sad, and really doesn't solve anything. I was disappointed in this book, but it's not terrible enought to warrant less than three stars...barely.
B00A8ZZ2Z0|5.0|Best Helloween ever !! Incredible heavy metal experience >D Deris Forever!! This is a must listen for any and all true music fans ,electric and hardcore !! Long live Helloween !!
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|Peter Pan has always been a favorite of mine since I was a child.  Although I have the first DVD of it released, I couldn't resist getting the blu ray copy and it didn't disappoint.  Brilliant colors and graphics with the same beloved story. If you have one of the bigscreen tv's you will think you are at the theatre seeing it for the first time.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This story was riveting. I felt the characters' emotions and was pulled in until the very end.  It is a great story and well worth reading.
B002SRQ214|5.0|The CPU seems to handle everything I can throw at it. Video Encoding speeds are decent. If you don't have the money to spend on an intel go get this AMD!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I enjoy this game a lot. It is challenging,  quick,  and skill building. A few hundred more timed and I will actually be good at this game. I like that. It will be a while before I get board and move on to a new challenge.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|THIS IS A REALLY BAD MOVIE, bad directing not worth the money spent! Don't rent it! It should of never even have been nominated.
B00785P2QC|5.0|great game fun to play I really enjoy playing. I would download again and again and again and again and again great gamer (<br />/
B004YAS9M8|5.0|For those that love Yanni, Enya, Andrea Boccelli, this is another musician you will love.  I am ordering more of Einaudi.  Peace!
1419707663|5.0|Getting the three pack is less per book than each individual book. Goerge is a great charecter who and the books show the cosequences of his actions and becomes a teaching tool.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Josh has always touched me with his music in the past.  He just keeps getting better and better!  How is this possible?
B001XULSG6|3.0|Hard core trekkies will like, otherwise its OK entertainment. It does allow for quite a bit of character development, But I am not sure it is really additive.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game looks very realistic!!!!<br />The horse looks like a real animal looking after it is great fun hope they do more.
0312945973|5.0|One of the best writers ever! Great story teller! It  is like you are in the story , like it could really happen.
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|The sound is a little different than what I am used to hearing from Led Zepplin but makes it interesting.  Very well recorded sound.  I went out and bought a Bose noise reduction set of headphones to listen to this and it makes you fell like your int he front row.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This movie was fantastic. Wonderful characters, very believable. I could watch it over and over. Beautiful scenery and locations. Wish I was there.
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|If you are responsible for a change initiative at work, or would simply like to change some aspect of your life , then this book is a must read for you.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Kathy Reichs continues her run of successful Temperance Brennan novels.  This book has many little subplots that do resolve in the end.  Sadly though I was disappointed at the final resolution to the original crimes that actually draw you into the novel.....their resolution appears to be an afterthought.  Many, many characters emerge throughout this book which, at times, can be a bit confusing trying to remember who goes with what crime especially if you've put the book down for any length of time.  Overall still loved the book although these are the reasons I had to rate it only 4 stars.  I have to say that I still remain drawn to this series and that Ms. Reichs continues writing very interesting novels - nice to see since a few other authors of the same genre have gone downhill.  I really enjoy her writing and am also really enjoying the &#34;Virals&#34; series....<br /><br />Recommend.
B004M8S440|5.0|Oldie but unbelievably goodie. These books never disappoint except that you get to the end too soon and have to start again.
B00AA0U046|5.0|I bought this record because ive always been a Hendrix fan but i recomend it to anyone searching for some classics but something new at the same time. i gave it 5 stars because well its so good the guitar licks are tasty the brass makes my feet tingle and the bluesy riffs are staright forward. Also, i was surprised to find it was 200 gram vinyl and came with a neat book full of pictures and how the songs came to be all around great record though
B008X9Z4I8|1.0|It may have been my mistake for not checking. but I wanted a cover that I could keep my Kindle in while I was reading it. I have to take my Kindle all the way out to read,
1250012570|5.0|Just finished this wonderful book and am already missing the amazing Eleanor & Park. Their love story reminded me of my own past, falling in love with my husband of 42 years when we were just teenagers. There is something plaintively beautiful about first love and, YES, Eleanor & Park....Sometimes it does last a lifetime!
B000V5Y1SQ|5.0|Easily the best star trek franchise! I recommend it highly. It is the only war time star trek, which gives it a battle star feel.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Fun to play. The only thing is you need wify to play. Other than that its a great time killer.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Could hardly put it down. Upset its over.. Would love to know more about what happened when he returned to the future the first time and more of the job of the yellow card men.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|It was more thought provoking than I ever thought it would be.  I had no idea about it except what I had seen in the previews.  It's is wonderfully written and well worth the read.
B00A9Z2NKG|5.0|Mulholland Drive is in my estimation the single finest motion picture ever made.  As a story, it plumbs the true depths of the human spirit.  As a film it uses the extremities of sordid, beautiful and phantasmagorical images; exploiting the furthest reaches of this art form.  The music is exquisite and serves to move the narrative and emotion of the film forward with deft, seamless pieces.  Diane Selwyn is one of the lasting creations of the human intellect.  Conceived by David Lynch and brought to life by Naomi Watts in one of the greatest screen performances ever, Selwyn cautions all of us and reminds us of the pitfalls of the oft spouted bromide that we should 'follow our dreams'.  Neglect to see this masterwork at your hazard.
B00ATPVA78|4.0|I cannot get this game to respond properly. I even had trouble writing this review. I am getting very frustrated!
0312323867|5.0|loveeeeeeeeeee this book. thinking about reading it again. can't wait for the movie to come out but not sure if it ever will. best book ever way better than twilight
B000W93CHC|5.0|i read the first book years ago. this one is as good or better than the first.<br /><br />a real history lesson
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I have this app and have trouble with the  top b square,I have sent several emails to them from the game and on their site and all I get back is a standerd email asking for more information after I have allready given them it in my first email. Bad customer service. I have lost bingos because of not being able to daub the top b square on the left hand game, I have also heen charged more bingos for a game then the room I was in said it was to play(it said one bingo per card and I was charged four per card) this happened more then once. I have been waiting over one month but still no answer from them. Play at your own risk
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Could be that it's not drilled into my head like the older releases; but this whole album ROCKS! Chokes me up to think what could have been.... If you like the originals you will LOVE THIS!!!!
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I ordered this game thinking it would only come with the disk and nothing more and I always wanted the sticker that game with this game when you pre-ordered it but I figured It would be too late for that. Men was I wrong. I was so exited when I saw the sticker that came with it. Who knows maybe if you order it next it'll come with out, Definitely a good buy, I was thinking on getting either this or gravity rush but I decided I'd get PlayStation plus and get gravity rush for free also with Wipeout 2048(free as well) and Uncharted Golden Abyss all for 18 bucks unless I change my mind later on and get the one year PlayStation plus card. But anyways, it shipped on time, and...what can I say? Buy it. One of the best RPG's known to the Vita yet.
B00B49L7JY|4.0|This was a very interesting documentary about a singer/songwriter who never gained fame here in the USA. It's a shame people didn't embrace him like other similar musicians of the day. It took South Africa, New Zealand & Australia to open up the doors for him. Those countries seemed more 'open minded' to his lyrics and Rodriguez himself over all. I am glad I watched it!
B0010SEMP0|5.0|Check out my video review of One Foot in the Grave on YouTube. Search Shelf Addiction! This was a fun and fast paced book. If you've started this series, you'll want to continue on to read more about Cat and Bones! It's still early on in the series, but in my opinion, the story is getting more interesting and more complex as we go along. I'm hopeful that the next book will be equally as good if not better!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|a lot of fun to play and works great on the kindle..someof the tack could be cheaper lol I would definitely recommend
B007SGM084|5.0|This is one of two favorite books.  Do wish that Ms. James writes a follow up from Christian's point of view.  I have recommended this book to many.  Worth the money - and time,  It is a must read, open mind people.....
B005R32L66|5.0|Love thè feeling of knowing of seeing your family and friends,face or<br />Just chat.Its the best of feelings.love it try it.:-)
B00846REIS|5.0|Engaging from the first page.  Ms. Day is a wonderful author.  Must read all books in order.  Third is due out ??  Been delayed three times - hopefully we will see it in June 2013
B0095P31L6|2.0|I never got to the end of the movie. It just was not very interesting. I may try to finish it one of these days.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|How could you NOT like Tom Sawyer?!  Mark Twain's books are classics, and should be read at least once at some time in your life!
1594203059|5.0|This is the second book I have read by Niall Ferguson. It is a well-written, fully engaging examination of western civilization and how our societies evolved to dominant the world in so many ways, and to contibute to its evloution, both negatively and postively. Mr. Ferguson is a talented writer and historian and great presenter of information, both on the written page and on the television screen. The biggest take-away message from the book  -- which all policy-makers, elected officials, and citizens should be mindful of today -- is the vital role science and learning have played in our success, and how much they have contributed to the betterment of humankind the world over. We -- the &#34;west&#34; and the &#34;evolving rest&#34; -- should continue to place a high value on scientific research and discovery.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Viewing the first four seasons will help you appreciate the character development of this series, which brings being &#34;nerdy&#34; to whole new level of cool!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I think this is one of the best series I have ever watched.  Takes you back in time making you believe you are living in it.  Great job with costumes, artifacts, automobiles and setting.  Can't make a mistake by watching Dowton Abbey.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Best Bible app on the market. It works well but is somewhat slow after the last update. The reading plans are a nice feature when synced across devices.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|EDGE starts out easy, but really picks up steam.  Trying to get all the pickups gives it that extra challenge.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Excellent story.  I felt like I was with her on the trail.  Many stories from her personal life intertwined with the actual hike.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The movie was good but the book was awesome!  I Love Nicholas Sparks books, Safe Haven was one of the best!
1780387105|5.0|This book provides many easy songs to practice while following Justin Sandercoe's free guitar lessons online at justinguitar.com. The text and suggestions are helpful and encouraging. I recommend this book and Justin's lessons to anyone starting out on guitar.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Hotel Transylvania is fantastic! Plenty of potty humor, great one liners and my boys, ages 2, 6, and 10 LOVED it. Finally a kids movie that had me laughing and not dozing!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Definitely not for minors. Amazing. Not typically into romance- type novels... Well, they 50 shades triology is an exception. Amazing. Enough said.
B001AQO3QA|2.0|First time I ordered this box set the first film in the series was defective and would severely skip around mid film. I returned it to Amazon and received a set that looked worse for wear. I was very impressed by the packaging the first time I received it, but the second one has a lot of scratches and dings all over the packaging and it looks like it's been dropped a couple of times, it even looks as though it might have been returned at one time. I'm not going to go through the hassle of returning it again and waiting patiently for a new copy to arrive hoping that it isn't as aesthetically unpleasing as the last time, or worse discover that it doesn't work properly. I'm pretty OCD when it comes to my things though, and I might just end up sending this box set back for one that isn't as scratched and dinged up. I've spent thousands shopping through amazon, and this is the first time that I've been very unimpressed by them. I hope it doesn't become a habit. If I discover the films to be defective I will definitely return it and get my money back pronto. I have significantly scaled back my purchases from amazon since they've started to charge sales tax in my home state of Texas, it seems that they're starting to give me even more good reason to shop from their online competitors who don't charge shipping or sales tax. I love you amazon, but please stop breaking my heart.<br /><br />As far as the films are concerned, Aliens is one of the most epic sagas out there. Sci-Fi done right. Last two films aren't as great as the first two though.
B007BVT5N4|5.0|Let me start by saying, No... I am not a 15 year old girl. LOL<br />I am a 24 year old female. I loved this book. Of course, Justin is not an 'author', so I didn't expect William Shakespeare... But this book is so real. This reminds you that Justin was not \\"made\\" as so many people believe, he worked so hard to get to where he is today. You see so much negative press about him... But he is so much more than that. You don't see all of the good that he does. Anybody that doubts him or his authenticity should read this book, any age (male or female). He is real. He cares. He has a good heart. You shouldn't be so quick to judge by what you see on TV and in the magazines... You should try to know who he is and what he's about.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Oh, I loved this couple!  I couldn't download Point of Retreat quick enough after I finished this book.  My only minor critique is that I thought the ending was a little weak, but it wasn't enough to demote the book to 4 stars.  Definitely worth the read!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|It's Nicholas Sparks. He's amazing. I have never read one book from him that fell short and this book certainly does not. Loved it.
B003O86FMW|3.0|This book was interesting, like the original.  However, the final book (Mockingjay), just ruined this whole series for me.  If I could take it back after reading Mockingjay, I wouldn't read a single book in the series.  So...although Catching Fire was an interesting read (I loved the Katniss/Peeta interaction, and the character of Finnick was also very entertaining), I would still take it back after reading how it all plays out in the final book.
B004FOOQV6|5.0|Why is it spelled &#34;Convertor&#34; Pro? hmmmm...No matter. I dig this app. I work in blown film extrusion and have used this many times as I am not great at converting 32's, 16's, 8's etc. to decimal and vice versa in me head to fractions. I have to do it fairly quickly and this has helped me a ton.<br /> There is so much that this app can do that I feel a bit over-whelmed by it. Kinda fun too.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I'm a huge fan of these types of movies (covert operative stuff) and I'm also a huge fan of John Goodman. Love the guy in everything he plays. So this was the best of both worlds. Suspenseful and full of talented actors. You can't go wrong with Argo, and their awards shelf speaks for itself!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I like temple run 1, but my phone won't accomodate it.<br /><br />Btw, i heard minutes ago on the news that Amazon.com is nominated number1 to do business with! Congratulations
B00000331V|5.0|THE J. GEILS BAND-BLOW YOUR FACE OUT: No one ever threw a house party quite like the mighty J. GEILS BAND, a roots-baring grab bag of brash blooze, good time rock &amp; roll and staggering soul power. Wild man wailer PETER &quot;WOOFA GOOFA&quot; WOLF is one of the seventies' (and well beyond) most charismatic, energetic front men, peppering the party with tongue-twistin' jive disc jockey patter (his former occupation), and belting the hell outta covers of everything from TRUCK DRIVIN' MAN and RAISE YOUR HAND to WHERE DID OUR LOVE GO. J. GEILS' lean 'n mean axe work, SETH JUSTMAN's funky keyboard punctuation, and the smack-down rhythm section of DANNY KLEIN and STEPHEN JO BLADD are bolstered by harp master-blaster MAGIC DICK literally blowin' his face off every chance he gets. Recorded in their native Boston and their adopted hometown of Detroit, LOVE-ITIS, MUSTA GOT LOST and GIVE IT TO ME are funky, rowdy, sanctifying slabs of righteousness that make this one of the coolest concerts ever waxed, a more than fitting sequel to their legendary live outing FULL HOUSE.<br /><br />RATING: FIVE SOUTHSIDE SHUFFLES
B005S9EJ46|5.0|The best in British actors and acting. A great film about lovely people experiencing life's awkward moments. This one is a keeper. Well worth watching time and again.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|This book is written from the dogs perspective. I have enjoyed it thus far.<br />I am almost done.  Hopefully the ending will be just as good.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book is such a great read and my personal favorite. I've yet to meet someone that didn't love it. It grabs you from the start and you find yourself cheering for Pat the whole way through. And you can tell that Matthew Quick wrote this one from the heart.
B00BHMF578|4.0|Good movie, well done, suspenseful, but not nail biting.  It's a fine piece of art, just not what I would've chosen for Best Picture.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Can't wait for my kids to try it...I think they will really have fun with it. but until then it's all mine lol
030758836X|4.0|A true page-turner from the word go, and I enjoyed it right up until the ending. It was a fantastic, twisted concept and the characters were so different from anyone I would consider \\"normal\\", it was hard not to be swept into their world; if only because the circumstances were so intriguingly bizarre. I don't know who is more loathesome ... Amy or her un-able husband, Nick, and even though I didn't like either of them, I wanted to keep reading about them. This is a very gifted author.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Lots of fun, love to play this app. Played it on my iPod and now on my kindle fire. Love it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Every thing and more.....Only on a tablet....on phones when feeding its hard for the buckets to reed your finger. love this app thank you.<br />the main fact is that its free you know what I'm saying. just something to do when I'm board.<br />I cant say much more then that.
B00B49L7JY|4.0|Don't get me wrong, it's an amazing story, so much you could think it's fake. But it's not.<br /><br />But it's not a documentary worth of an Oscar. Yes, there's some good interviews and storytelling, but not a lot of documentation of the real thing.<br /><br />But totally worth watching.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|I'm a BIG Horror fan. I think that I have seen every popular and a giant portion of obscure Horror films with my favorites being the classics. This movie was pretty good, even WITH Ethan Hawke in it. The story line is unique and the end is pretty good. Using a lot of Dark and Shadows, the whole time you are being sucked deeper into the film simply because you are concentrating so hard, in order to not miss anything. Since everyone will have their own take on this film, there is no way to pigeon hole it with some label. So, that being the case, my feelings about it are &#34;It's Creepy&#34;
B009G8GRX6|5.0|Every time there's a new Muse album you want to hate it just because it's different. But it's always a surprise, and it grows on you.. This is no exception.
B00BESLHEA|2.0|I was anticipating a gritty hard edged film from the Tarantino crew. The first attempt at watching it, put me fast asleep so I had to try and watch it again. I made it through and it cost me a couple additional hours of sleep. I wouldn't recommend this flick to anyone. I think it was a simple vehicle for a payday for the participants. I would rather watch the old cheesy Kung Fu films that I used to see every Saturday morning on &#34;Kung Fu Theater&#34; Poor sound, Poor dubbing, Poor production work. But they were entertaining never the less. This film was not. (In my humble opinion)

0618918248|5.0|Poor Dawkins must feel abandoned/excluded when comes a religious holiday. I tried to imagine him at Christmas, Hannukah, Thanksgiving, Easter, or even missing the joyous get together of the Ramadan.<br />What good is it to live in a religious country, if you do not follow the same religious rites than your fellow citizens?<br />Isn't strange that Dawkins never discussed in his book moving to an atheist country, if there is one?<br /><br />Anyway, this is his problem and if Dawkins pretends to feel well being an atheist, which I honestly believe, it certainly makes sense. I felt in the book a huge love for life, sometimes so excessive that it is contagious. However, it is a pity that Dawkins had chosen this route, being such a clever fellow.<br />He obviously does not believe neither in God or in Man, e.g.:<br />page 126 what is the purpose of man? \\"To have a good lunch.\\"<br />page 392: What is Dawkins' faith in Man: \\"Chimpanzees and gorillas look more like humans than adult ones do.\\"<br />And about Faith, a word that Dawkins ignores, please skip the whole chapter 3: what kind of an atheist is one who wants to introduce the reader to arguments proving the existence of God? Why did'nt Dawkins take the advice of one of his \\"deists\\" friend? Pascal's bashing is a summit in misunderstanding and perhaps unfairness.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this book is a must to read, well documented, filled with humour, in an excellent English, the pure writing of a top class scientist, reason being invoked at every page. I have to admit that although I am a believer, I took pleasure in reading Dawkins' book (such humor!) and would gladly recommend it to anyone wanting to know what a strange kind of human an atheist is.<br />I learned a lot. The book is full of references about atheism, agnosticism, ID (Intelligent Design), Darwin's theory and many other interesting subjects. There Dawkins excels in approving/criticizing/derogating, etc.<br /><br />In summary, this is a very inspirationalbook, but paradoxically towards the existence of GOD. It will never convince anyone that GOD does not exist!!!
B000UFAURI|5.0|This album while other foo fighters album mostly being great hard rock, this balances with light rock songs and some great piano and acoustic settings. This album, which may not be their most popular, is a great piece for any real time foo fighters fan.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great Kindle app  It helps with so many different study themes  I would highly recommend this app!!

B004RC8NUQ|3.0|No Strings Attached had a lot of the right elements to be a really good movie, but the language turned me off... very crude and crass. If someone used the words that came out of these character's mouths, in my company, I would turn around and walk away. Very crass. Nice people don't talk that way. Then again, I'm old school and find the 'F' word very offensive along with a host of others words that seem to flood the airwaves and movies these days.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|Not used to reading this type of novel, as my tastes tend toward the psych. drama genre.  I like Connelly, Sandford, John Kellerman, etc.,  but I needed something new to read, so I tried this for a change--  that ,it was!<br /><br />Actually, the first part of the novel, with its references to magic and illusion, and the practioners of such, I found interesting and well-paced.  Characters were somewhat defined, but as the novel wore on, I found myself NOT caring about fates of any of the main players.<br /><br />The novel jumps around alot--in time, as well as with plot twists.  It was fun for a time, but then I found it boring and trivial.  I simply wanted the novel to END.  I did not care about the outcome at all.<br /><br />Promising start, brutal finish.  For me, it was a diversion, at best.  Will I read another by this writer? Probably not.
0316017930|5.0|I  read pretty much everything Malcolm Gladwell writes--his articles and his books. Sometimes his explanations may be more poetic than factual, but he's still a fun and informative read. This is one of his best in terms of facts.
0684803356|1.0|I don't get what all the fuss was about Hemmingway being such a great author.  This story sucked, especially the ending.  It just ends!  And what's with \\"rope-soled shoes\\"?  He must use this phrase twenty times in the first couple chapters when describing someone.  Then there's this schmuck, the main character, Robert Jordan, who has a screw loose.  He keeps having a two way conversation with himself.  I know I sometimes say something to myself like: \\"Boy Jeff that was a pretty stupid thing to do!\\", but I don't answer myself back!  About the only positive thing I can say about this book is that some of the stuff in it about suicide sheds some light on why Hemmingway blew his brains out later in life. Boy, to think that this is touted as probably Hemmingway's best work!  If that's the case then one Hemmingway book is enough for me.  Now you take Dostoyevsky, there was a writer!

B008HK3XU4|4.0|When I first received this case I didn't like that it had the plastic leather type feel. However, after it has been broken in I have started to like the texture a little more. It has softened a bit with wear.<br />Everyone has said the same thing time and time again in these reviews that they don't like the way the charger sits when charging. I expected that. Me personally I don't care. It doesn't affect me at all when reading with the charger plugged in. I don't mind leaving the case open. I purchased a screen protector and that took care of that. It really isn't that big of a deal.<br />I also like that the kindle can be positioned in many ways for viewing. And I have never caught it slipping.<br />Lastly, I like that the kindle sets into a hard setting on the corners. I don't want to drop it only for it to have been held by elastic bands that will allow it to pop right out.<br />All in all, it's a really good case. The outside material could be improved, AND come with better designs, but for functionality overall its great!

B009GQ57ES|2.0|Basic rap/pop but wrapped in liberal propaganda and gutter talk. Has all the ingredients for same old rap: trash talk of white people and conservative ideals, sex, sex, sex, party, why they are so awesome.<br /><br />Well produced album with tight arrangements, but nothing really special here. Lyrically...just talking point coming from the progressive agenda. Oh, and why they are so awesome.
0062014536|4.0|REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!<br /><br />As a huge fan of Lauren Oliver (Before I Fall still remains on one of my top ten YA books of all time), I was so excited to read this book.<br /><br />I devoured the first few chapters and grew more and more enthusiastic about the revolution (yes, it finally happens in this book!). I found myself enjoying Hana's parts sometimes even more than Lena's. Hana had great character development here, and I found myself sympathizing with her on more than one occasion.<br /><br />Oliver continued what she was always good at in this new novel: writing beautiful prose with such vivid details that readers are simply sucked into the scene. Her writing just flows marvelously.<br /><br />Now, the cons...<br /><br />Hana's ending. Now, what was up with that? What Lena saw was NOT how I imagined Hana to be like. Lena described her as almost robotic and cloudy, which is not the image I had of Hana during her POVs. And how can Hana's ending be so open-ended? She just... walks away. The end.<br /><br />Julian and Lena. I was just shaking my head when Lena suddenly decided that &#34;although she loved Julian, she loved Alex more&#34;. So overdone and predictable. Like, how many times does a YA heroine resolve her love triangle crisis with that conclusion? And to top it off, she doesn't even tell Julian what her decision is. Julian is left hanging (or should I say, fighting?) ... like the rest of us.<br /><br />I would say more, but I don't want to spoil everything haha.<br /><br />Overall, the book was a wonderful and highly addicting read! I feel like I complained too much; if the ending hadn't left me so dumbfounded, I would've been highly satisfied with this final book of the trilogy. Going to miss it!
B004RLPWXS|5.0|Big fan here, and objectively as possible, this is a fantastic piece of work. Definitely one of their best albums. Very well produced with tight sounds and complex rhythms that make you want to listen to it over and over. Album stands on its own, and could easily be a first album for new Duran Duran fans.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|easy to see. extremely easy to operate.  fast.  the best I have used for a handheld calculator.  and to beat all that IT IS FREE !!!!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The concept and plot points were interesting and kept me reading, but the language could have been more exciting. There are a lot of the same words used repeatedly which could have been made more intriguing with simple descriptions being changed instead of using words/phrases repeated from earlier in the book or from the first book. Overall, a book I would suggeat

0679731725|5.0|I heard a blurb for a recent Man Booker Prize winner on the radio, and decided to give it a try.  I hated it.  Thankfully, one reviewer of that book recommended several other books that did the \\"unreliability of perception and memory\\" theme much better, and The Remains of the Day was said to be one of the best.  Needless to say, I had high expectations, and the book exceeded them all.  I read [[ASIN:0679722661 An Artist of the Floating World]] in college, but honestly didn't remember much of Ishiguro's style.<br /><br />The book is told in the first person by \\"Stevens,\\" as he is constantly referred to, the butler of Darlington Hall.  Now with a new employer, and given some time off, he takes an extended drive to  another part of the country, to visit a woman who had also been previously employed at Darlington Hall.  Along the drive, Stevens thinks back over his life and his memories of Darlington Hall.<br /><br />Pretty simple plot, but the results are exquisite.  The unfolding of layer after layer of these memories is riveting.  Sometimes it is laugh out loud comical, as Stevens' rigid, ultra-professional persona is cast into some awkward situations.  Other times, the results are tragic and pitiful, as the same rigidity keeps him from relating to those he should care about most.  I found Stevens to be a fascinating character.  Flaws that are found in all of us - misplaced priorities, sense of identity, deluding ourselves, rationalization - are taking to their extremes in Stevens.  Some have complained that he is like a robot.  Maybe, yes, but the program is spelled out for all of us to see, the flaws in reasoning, why he acts the way he does.  And even so, the program isn't watertight, you see glimpses of Steven's soul poke through, especially as he realizes how wrong he's been throughout his life.<br /><br />In all I found this book to be fascinating, gripping, moving, and thought provoking.  One of my favorite books for sure!  And, as an aside, very clean.  Modern \\"award winning fiction,\\" I'm convinced is code word for \\"immoral filth, written cleverly.\\"  This book contains no immorality, no foul language, and even an affirmation of marriage.  I give this book my highest recommendation.n \\"award winning fiction,\\" I'm convinced is code word for \\"immoral filth, written cleverly.\\"  This book contains no immorality, no foul language, and even an affirmation of marriage.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The casting, photography, script and directing in this British turn-of-the-century production are superb!  What sets this series apart from your usual British or American 'soap opera' is its clear depiction of the confusion and challenges the 'nobility' face when wars, advances in technology, and changes in social mores all converge, and the ruling class is helpless to stop the eradication of class lines.  Not only are the Lords and Ladies of Downtown Abbey opposed to all the changes, but their household staff, who derive satisfaction from being associated with such a 'Great House' and noble family, display their own brand of snobbery.  Happily, the writers created complex characters who portray a mixture of upper class snobbery and genuine caring about their servants and the tenants who depend upon Downton Abbey for their livelihood. The servants are equally complex, from the head butler to the lowliest housemaid.  Consequently, my whole family was 'hooked' from the very first episode.  Virtually every human emotion and every human condition is portrayed as the story progresses.  We can't wait for the 4th season!
B000OJFV4C|4.0|The period costume and sets are amazing, the acting is well done. It's just missing something.<br /><br />I'm only on episode 4, and a number of the secondary characters have drawn me in, but not any of the primaries. The plot seems to jump around a bit, but I don't know enough history to say if that's history's fault or the writing, within any episode it's tight, there just seems to be large swings in direction from episode to episode.

1616550414|5.0|Where can I start? It's about time. As soon as you open, the book immediately engages you with pictures and captions filled to the brim. Shigeru Miyamato did a wonderful job getting a team to compile such a rich history and timeline of one of the most popular video game franchises of Nintendo and the world. I am astounded by the effort, and it has answered some issues and questions I had about the order of the Zelda stories. It also got me interested in the other Zelda games I haven't played or thought about, and made me think more about how serious and deep this franchise really can be. What initially started as an innocent story about a grown boy saving a princess from a demon has turned into a much darker and deeper story of emotional turmoil, power vs courage vs wisdom, character developments, as well as an atmospheric and cinematic experience. Playing the original 2 NES games only has half the experience of what Zelda has today, having all the features I listed formerly.  I will cherish this book as a great collectable. Thank you Miyamato and your team for such an awesome book.

B00AA0TZTW|4.0|I absolutely love this recording. This release follows the same path as the previous two Experience Hendrix releases which entails mining the extensive studio out-take, demo and rehearsal material Jimi accumulated during his lifetime. It's no secret the guy loved experimenting and working on new music in the studio and apparently there are still quite a few amazing gems for fan's to discover.  What Janie Hendrix and Eddie Kramer have been doing with the Hendrix estate is commendable. Were these recordings ever intended for commercial release? No.  However, due to Jimi's untimely passing, the relatively sparse commercial output released during his lifetime and the seemingly unquenchable thirst for new product by his most ardent followers, I think they are perfectly justified in making these releases available to the public/Jimi's fans.<br /><br />Arguments against the continued raiding of Jimi's archival recordings on the grounds that \\"he would never have wanted this stuff released\\" or \\"This is just rehearsal material warts and all, poor quality, etc.\\" have been ongoing ever since the mid-70's (see Crash Landing and Midnight Lightning).  While valid to a certain extent, we have reached a point where the music industry has carved out a niche market catering to those who appreciate examining/listening to various aspects of an artist's creative process. With the release of several \\"bootleg\\" recordings by Miles Davis, Neil Young, Bob Dylan, John Coltrane, The Grateful Dead, The Beatles Anthology, etc. I would argue that there is quite a large market for this sort of material, there are fans who want to hear it, so more power to the people in control of Jimi's legacy for doing it right.<br /><br />Four stars for the quality of material and sound quality. If your a beginner, I'd start someplace else.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really enjoyed reading Hopeless.  I thought it was well written and very easy to read.  I read the entire book in a day!  I love how towards the end of the book all of the earlier pieces of the plot finally fall into place and you fall in love with the main characters even more.  It had very deep situations and circumstances that drew my attention and made it super hard to put the book down.  I definitely recommend this one!
B001224WBS|4.0|Depeche Mode was never one of my favorite bands, but there are a few songs (People are People, Enjoy the Silence, Personal Jesus) that I always liked a lot, so it seemed like a no brainier to buy this for 2.99. I've only listened through part way, so I'm just getting familiar with some of the other songs. It seems like a good purchase for the price.
B00BHMF578|2.0|over hyped; zero dark thirty was better within same genre; certainly not best picture worthy; decent enough to watch though
B00BAYLQI0|4.0|\\"The Impossible\\" (2012 release; 113 min.) brings the story (based on true events) of the Bellon family vacationing in Thailand on the eve of the largest tsunami recorded in history (December 26, 2004). Maria (played by Naomi Watts) and Henry (played by Ewan McGregor) are with their 3 boys, ages 5 to 12. Fifteen minutes into the movie, and the tsunami hits. I have never seen anything like it before (blowing away any comparison to Clint Eastwood's \\"Hereafter\\"). The next 30 min. are some of the more harrowing I have seen in a movie in a long, long time. It is truly hard to describe the devastation that we get to witness. Maria and her 12 yr. old son Lucas (played by Tom Holland) are split off from the rest of their family, and try to hang on for dear life (literally). To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br /><br />Several comments: first and foremost, the acting performance from Naomi Watts is superb, playing a heavily wounded/half-dead woman who nevertheless wants to do what she can to save her family. Newcomer Tom Holland as the 12 yr. old Lucas is very effective as well. Second, the photography of the movie is visually astonishing, creating images that will stay with me for quite some time. Third, interestingly this is not a American or British production, but in fact it is entirely Spanish, from the director (J.A. Bayona) on down, the entire crew is Spanish. Last but certainly not least, despite the scenes of the tsunami, this is not a 'disaster movie' but instead it is a tribute to the human spirit. It is in the most devastating and impossible of situations such as this tsunami where we see that so many strangers from many different countries nevertheless find a way to communicate and help each other out. In that sense, this is a very uplifting movie.<br /><br />\\"The Impossible\\" is a powerful movie that packs a lot of emotional wallop. I will admit to tearing up quite a few times in the movie. This movie is rated PG-13 but there is no way that I would take a 12 or 13 yr. old kid to see this. That aside, \\"The Impossible\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!es in the movie.

B00AMBH70S|3.0|I like Renner, and think he did as good a job as anyone could trying to follow Damon in this series. However, I was ultimately disappointed in the movie, as a whole, because it did not feel like a worthy continuation to carry the Bourne title. Damon set the bar extremely high, and I think it would've been better for this movie to begin a different story under a different title. For much of the movie, I kept thinking how I would rather be watching one of the original trilogy again, rather than this one.

But the boys had a little left, and I think we are the better for their having mended their issues to produce what I assume will be their final album. Since purchasing the mp3 album (for a deep discount) last summer, I must admit I haven't returned to it as often as I thought I might, but that doesn't make it a bad album. I suppose somewhere deeply rooted in me, the Beach Boys are equated with Summer fun, so perhaps I'll find my way back to the album when the snow has melted. On discount, a worthy addition to your music library!
B00991TCOG|4.0|Great music, but it came with all the inconvenience of a physical disc. I'd much rather have a digital download. So, I ripped the CD to FLAC and tossed the disc in the closet. Problem solved.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I discovered this app when looking for relaxing sounds for my iphone.  I downloaded the free version for my iphone, which came with only 2 binaural beats and a fraction of the sounds of the full app.  After about an hour of exporing the sounds ()and beats, I downloaded the full (paid) app for my phone, and later paid again to have it on my kindle.  It is worth every penny!<br /><br />I was simply AMAZED at how well the binaural beats work.  The app comes with a half-dozen of them, designed for everything from focusing on a task while awake to entering the deep, dreamless state of sleep.  You must have headphones for the binaural beats to work properly, but they have worked wonders for helping me get to sleep when I'm struggling with it.<br /><br />The other thing that I LOVE about this app is the ability to layer and customize sounds!  You can layer as many different sounds and beats as you like, adjust the volume of each individual layer, and save the combinations to your favorites.  I can put myself on a windy beach with light rain and a touch of wind, then add a relaxing binaural beat and drift off to sleep.  Wonderful!
030758836X|4.0|I loved this book. I didn't necessarily agree with the ending, but I was totally enthralled the entire time. It took me on a psychological and emotional roller coaster and sucked me right in. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone I talk to :)
B00A1C1DYE|5.0|I love this show, and you really can't beat the price on this box set.  The picture and sound quality is great.  The item is attractively packaged, and the sleeve keeps all discs together.  Buy for hours of laughs :-)
B007QUUIEA|5.0|Perks if being a wallflower made me laugh, cry, smile and even close the Book and yell at it. (I am not crazy). I (being a wallflower myself) loved this book and if you're  thinking about reading it, i think you'll really love it. Also watch the movie 1st and than read the book. Stay infinite. Love always Ellenxx
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|After the reeeeeallly long download (and the anticipation of how great this game could possibly be) once you get to the loading screen for the game, i get to &#34;name&#34; my park and the application shuts down back to the home screen. every. single. time.  REALLY DISAPPOINTING, PLEASE FIX THIS FOR KINDLE FIRE!!!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I got this as a FAOTD, but I would definitely pay for this game. (KF 1st Gen) This is an addictive game that has grown since I first got it. Kudos to the creators & thanks for your work & consideration! I would recommend this game to anyone with the ability to concentrate for at least 60 seconds and likes challenging matching games. There are 5 modes, 4 of which are timed.<br /><br />1) The puzzle mode is great to push yourself to concentrate. It's a fun pair matching game. Shifting the cube is almost unavoidable when making a match. The sensitivity is pretty awesome when you can barely see a match and still select it without taking time to spin the cube though.<br /><br />2 & 3) The one-minute and five-minutes modes are a count down version of the puzzle mode. It's fun & fast.<br /><br />4) The cube attack mode challenges you to match all pairs and adds pairs at regular intervals. I really dislike this play mode. When a new set of pairs is about to be added, the screen freezes and your chosen matches are lost. It's a noticeable lag time and very frustrating.<br /><br />5)The stationary camera mode is not timed. It has the same matching goal, but as you may have guessed, the cube itself stays stationary. Part of the success of this mode is in thanks to the sensitivity the creators gave this game. Without it, this mode would be impossible. Determination helps too!<br /><br />Lastly, you are given the options to use Amazon game circle and tweet results. I don't care to do either, so my rating does not cover those options.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Lots of Fun... When I have time to play. Great time killers. Living the graphics too! Wonder what's gonna be next for Angry Birds.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is an awesome game because you get to choose different characters, collect items, and share with friends. I hope the people who made this game make a Subway Surfers 2!
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|The beginning of the movie was very fast and had a lot of action, always enjoy a Denzel Washington movie. As the movie went on it kind of slowed down a bit.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|I went through this like it was a children's book. Very good written.<br /><br />After reading it, I was able to easily adapt all the ideas. It is basically a lean tutorial for your startup. So if you read The Lean Startup, this is a fantastic supplement using which you can start iterating to build the product you want. And if that product is in SaaS or web app field, you will love it.
B004LWZVZC|3.0|Boring, bad acting. A good director would have made a world of difference. The story line was accurate, but the acting was terrible.
B003ELY7PG|5.0|I was really looking forward to read this one. And I am glad that it met my expectations.<br /><br />The ideas described in this book are really good and can server as a great inspiration not only to business owners, but employees as well. However, you can't (or at least shouldn't) apply all of them to your business.<br /><br />And beware, some of the thoughts might seem quite revolutionary at first. But don't let that discourage you. Finish it till the end, have it sink in and come back to the ideas later. It is really worth it!
B000OVLINI|5.0|Was going to Barcelona where the story is set.  It gave insight into the history and a sense of the city in addition to a good story.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|It's my game, I couldn't get enough of it. Thanks for this free game. Hope you have more game like this.  :-)
B0001XAS2G|5.0|Back in 1978, when radio playlists were stuffed with disco and cheesy one-hit wonders, it was hard to find anyone who really stood out...but Al Stewart did.  Whenever \\"Time Passages\\" came on, Stewart's quiet voice made you want to stop and listen, and the beautiful string and sax arrangements embroidered his singing without drowning him out.  To finally have this album on CD is a joy.<br />Whoever transferred the recording to digital format was wise enough to leave Alan Parsons' production values alone, so it sounds just as wonderful as I remember (even better, in fact, since my first copy was an 8-track!). The title track is a standout, of course (despite its length, I never heard any radio station play an edited version); but the eerie \\"Life In Dark Water\\" is worth hearing as well, and if you like history, you definitely need to check out \\"Man For All Seasons\\" and especially \\"Palace Of Versailles,\\" which gives you a sort of Cliff's Notes of French revolutionary history. My personal favorite is \\"The End Of The Day,\\" which has some lovely acoustic guitar playing and closes out the album very nicely.<br />As if all this weren't cool enough, the liner notes include reminiscences by Al Stewart himself, including a tasty tidbit about how the song \\"Time Passages\\" was written, his own personal favorite tracks from the album, and his amicable professional separation from Parsons.<br />All in all, this album has aged remarkably well. In fact, I would consider it...timeless.
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|I own every album these ladies have put out and this is just as great as any other. Totally new sound but i do think there's some great tunes on this album. Even a couple i didn't like as much still find a way into my brain and i sing them all the time around the house....
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|DVD was of a high quality,  DVD was of a high quality,  DVD was of a high quality.  DVD was of a high quality
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is a fun app because it is a app where you can learn how to take care of a horse.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Don't want to spoil anything, but some previously over-dramatized issues are put in a more realistic perspective.  There is a bit more humor, which I appreciate, and at least one great surprise which has potential for development in future episodes.
B006LSZECO|4.0|An original thriller with twist that will leave you questioning weather the ending is a happy one or a just one.
B00B2G2RG6|3.0|The show hasn't quite found it's groove yet but I hope it will be renewed for a second season.<br />Every move Kevin Bacon makes as an actor is interesting.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|I enjoyed watching the movie. I found it fun and interesting. The story line ended up becoming a little predictable, but that is ok for a historical drama.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Each story mixes into the other seamlessly. Join the characters as they struggle with many issues brought on through a controlling society
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is an awesome addicting game and I like it more than temple run . This is the best game ever
B00BF2UKDE|5.0|The Bad Seeds are back with a ballads style record, but with songs based around Warren Ellis loops as opposed to Nick Caves piano playing.  It is beautiful, airy, and menacing all at the same time.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Very entertaining games, lots of fun, easy to play, mindless fun when you're bored and have some free time.<br />Highly recommended.
B000W967UQ|5.0|Well, I started reading the Discworld books only a few months ago and didn't know what to expect. Terry Pratchett is by far my most favorite satirical author. He has a way of making everything so absurd that it makes perfect sense. Mort ended up being a very intriguing look into something that we know so much, and yet so little, about: Death. It was deeply philosophical in a very tongue-in-cheek way that made it both extremely enjoyable and deeply satisfying. Mort is easily my third favorite Discworld novel that I have read so far and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get a six-pack without doing any crunches. If laughing adds years to your life, heck, I might never die!
0345535421|5.0|Was worth waiting for  ...  Reading the books has helped make time fly by quicker ...  Cant wait for season 3...
B00AYLTMMM|5.0|The Sessions was really overlooked this past year by the awards such as The Oscars and The Golden Globes.  Helen Hunt deservedly received a best supporting actress nomination (although she really was a lead).  John Hawkes gave another academy award performance (although not nominated), and when you start looking at his body of work it is apparent this guy is the real deal.  And then there is the movie/story based on a real person.  Everyone who loves the movies should see this film....it is beautifully filmed, directed and acted.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Was worth waiting for ... Love the series and all the characters ....  Books are a mighty read too ....  Cant wait for Season 3 to come out on DVD!
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|can't even download the game to try it out, very unhappy because it looked like a really fun game to play
B00B10DZQE|4.0|I liked this because I live in Half Moon Bay California where Mavericks is located and have an Oceanfront Inn at Mavericks.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Amazing book by an amazing warrior. Your service and dedication to this country will never be forgotten. R.I.P  (wish I could have met this true hero)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is the best game that i have ever played in my life i want eberone to try this game please come play this game.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender´s Game was always the book I saw on every book exchange shelf at offices. Finally I picked it up and read it. Orson Scott Card is a genius in his writing style and preparation of character development, story architecture, and efficient writing. Every page plays a critical and priceless role in the overall story.<br /><br />I highly recommend reading this book, even if you're not a huge sci-fi fan.<br /><br />READ IT BEFORE THE MOVIE COMES OUT!!!!!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book was extremely helpful in understanding my relationship, not only with my partner but with my friends as well.  I think I will also read the &#34;Singles&#34; and &#34;Children's&#34; edition as well.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Since the first book was incomplete when it ended, I read book two. I liked the characters so much, so kept reading. Emails are the best &#34;dialogue&#34; in this book.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Was disappointed that the first few minutes of the movie were basically spent bashing the United States but this, however, is probably one of the reasons that the movie got such rave reviews in Hollywood.<br /><br />The movie was exciting, and well done but, in my opinion, was certainly not an academy award winner.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|All three of these could have been one book.The first one ends terribly... so to resolve, must read the second one. Which I did. Content and conversation are a bit repetitive, but what can I say... I read all three.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|The acting was superb!  The movie content exciting!  Denzel was so convincing, that I would want him in the pilot seat of MY airplane in an emergency.
B005KELR3A|4.0|Sturdier than I thought it would be... no zipper failure yet. Nice no slip grip, and it's easy to keep clean.
B007VYAJAE|5.0|Marley, he was special, a great musican and it was worth it  to follow his life from a young age till the end. I will watch it again soon , being a prime member makes it possible. He loved what he was doing and worked like there was no time to waste. Between this movie and Searching for Sugarman , I have enjoyed two movies from my era ,very thankful to find these flicks, plus they are  true stories. Thank's Amazon
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|His books are very exciting, inspirational, creative, and awesome to read. It makes me feel like I'm one of the charactors in the books.  Zach Crandall
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|I didn't even know as most of us  didn't know of this guy Rodriguez during this time in  the 60's and 70's But I was totally locked in and pleased to pay for this movie. I would say if you like creative musical talent then watch this movie. You will not be disapointed.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I enjoyed reading the book but it is not one of my highest rated books.  I was surprised at the ending.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great app! I was very impressed. But you can't do a lot of things that you can on the computer. Overall, great app.
B008OOYALE|1.0|This game has my wife addicted to it.  Every 30 min she's asking me if she can buy gold to clear some shrubs.  It cost a 9-13 dollars for gold, she ready spent more money on this game than I have buying BF3.  It's cost a lot of money to play this  game, not worth it!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Was great game just wish it was longer.  I had no bugs and no problems g5 got it all.<br />I wish they would give average length. of time
B009VMN3RA|4.0|After seeing Sachi interviewed on TV, I downloaded the Kindle ebook and dove in.  I've seen Shirley MacLaine in many movies like millions of others have.  One does not learn about an actress from watching her movies obviously, but after reading this book, I see that she is a lot like her character in Guarding Tess.  She's a conundrum who surprises the hell out of you from time to time.  Sachi displays incredible resilience in her life as the daughter of Shirley.  What an eye-opener!  Sachi could have been quite a significant actress, being the daughter of such a movie icon.  As a parent, I find it very difficult to understand how Sachi's mother treated her daughter throughout her growing years.  When one thinks of a mother, one thinks about nurture.  I know that's not true for many in real life but the incredible lack any nurturing dynamic between mother and daughter as witnessed in this saga is almost beyond comprehension.  But this wasn't a consistent dynamic, all the time, as the reader eventually discovers.  Shirley MacLaine may simply fit into the category of someone of genius who knows little of appropriate behaviour outside the realm of (in her case) acting.  It's somewhat akin to other geniuses like Mozart who seemed like a blithering idiot except when it came to composing music.  I'm just trying to find a logic behind how Sachi was treated through her childhood and adolescence.  Some answers do come, especially about her father, but the real mystery still sits in Shirley's court.  Whatever the answers are to this, I found this one heck of a great read penned by someone with a story uniquely like no other.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can't wait for season 4 to begin.  It is a great show.  One of the best on TV today, I think
B008OE05IG|5.0|Amazing doc. Jiro and his philosophy when it come to making sushi and life in general is eye-opening. Also a great story of family and passing the torch. Watch this film. You won't be sorry.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Very useful, dictionary comes pre installed on kindle fire. A necessary tool for any avid reader. As  as person who reads for research purposes mostly, saves me time searching for words. Nice touch
B009G8GRX6|5.0|If you like Muse, then you'll like this album. Has everything that makes Muse, Muse. It's theatrical, melodramatic and powerful. Once again, I'm amazed that all that music is coming from just 3 guys. Muse does with this album what they do best.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Great game. Requires using your brain for these puzzles (I had to cheat on some ): . It's a good time killer and fun to boot!
B000I9WW0E|5.0|This movie gets better every time I watch it!! If you liked Fargo, O Brother Where Art Thou or any of the Coen Brothers other comedies you will love this. The only movie I've bought on VHS, DVD, Blu-Ray, AND digital. I love it that much.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My ten year old grandson requested this game and really knows how to play it.  He is really into Lego building and this game is an extension of that skill for him.  He loves it!
B004OBQDHK|5.0|How can you go wrong with a movie in which Patrick Swayze says, &#34;Back off Warchild. Seriously.&#34;??? This movie is incredible. Directed by Katheryn Bigelow who really knows how to create tension in a scene. The movie is cheesy but so insanely enjoyable. And Blu-Ray!!!! This movie was made to be watched in HD. Buy it. Enjoy it.
