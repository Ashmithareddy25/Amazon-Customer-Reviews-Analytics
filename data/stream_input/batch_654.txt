B000IHY9UW|1.0|Yet another re-issue and shaft job by the movie industry making DVD's, and releasing them with a few more extras one to six or seven years later. Give these crap re-issues one star, not based off the movie, but the shaft job done to loyal DVD customers. If you must buy this release, ALWAYS BUY USED. That way the vultures who play unfair won't make a profit off you. Then sell your old release, which will hopefully deter more people from buying the newer version, with a cheap old version on the market, and will hit these scumbags where it hurts the most... bottom profit line. Voice your anger, ALWAYS BUY USED IF YOU MUST BUY AT ALL, and tell them you're sick of this re-issue anniversary edition crap.

B000BW7QWW|4.0|For all of us Firefly freaks the movie helps to explain and tie up lose ends from the series.  If you haven't watched the series the movie could be confusing.  Also you may not be as invested in the characters as much and Serenity is definitely about the characters.  Digital effects are awesome and the film clips along at a good pace ensuring no boredom.  Overall the movie is good on it's own but I encourage people to view the series first...then the movie is great!  Once you see both you'll be saying with pathos \\"Can this be the end???\\"

B00007AJF9|5.0|Elizabeth the person was great, and so is Elizabeth the movie. It is a highly romanticized adaptation of Elizabeth I's turbulent life.  she went from being sentenced to death at the infamous London Tower, to being England's strongest female monarch in history.<br />The movie opens with scary shots of people being burned to death by Queen Mary I, also known in history as Bloody Mary. A devoted catholic, there was one thing Mary hated more than protestants, and that was her  half-sister Elizabeth, who not only was a protestant, but also a threat to strip the childless Mary of her title. Elizabeth is therefore imprisoned, but suddenly dies, which makes Elizabeth the queen. We are soon invited to see what really happens among royalty, as Elizabeth deals with the questions of marriage, love, war, conspiracies and power.<br />The movie has two stellar qualities. The first one is Kate Blanchett, who plays the title character with ease and skill. Instead of expressing her emotions only through her voice, she takes advantage of her body language - the way Elizabeth walks and dances is never the same, and sometimes all Blanchett needs to do is move her hand in order to express a sentiment. The second big thing about this movie is the direction. The director, Shekhar Kaphur, not only wisely exploits all Blanchett has to offer, he decides not to change the pace of the movie by adding more action or drama. Instead, he sticks with dialogue which is more than enough - the scenes where Elizabeth defends herself from the accusations and the preconceptions of her councilors are exciting and dramatic, despite their minimalistic concept. Also, the texture, color palette and composition are important aspects of the movie - the setting, color scheme, costuming and light always reflect the feelings Elizabeth is hiding behind her pale façade.<br />\\"Elizabeth\\" is undeniably a masterpiece. However, it will not appeal to everybody - some will find the subject uninteresting, or its pace monotonous. People who decide to truly follow it, think about it and enjoy it, though, will find the stellar cast (including the ever-watchable co-stars Geoffrey Rush, Joseph Fiennes, Vincent Cassel and Daniel Craig), fantastic crew and the wonderful English feel to it make this movie a royal treat, something to indulge in again and again.e who decide to truly follow it, think about it and enjoy it, though, will find the stellar cast (including the ever-watchable co-stars Geoffrey Rush, Joseph Fiennes, Vincent Cassel and Daniel Craig), fantastic crew and the wonderful English feel to it make this movie a royal treat, something to indulge in again and again.
B000GI3KHQ|5.0|The instruction was to 'focus on the product.' And so I will - on the product I bought through Amazon last year. This is a great film and the DVD issued in August (or September 2006) is a disgrace. Surely Amazon has recourse to whoever ploked this abortion on disc. Hopefully the 'new improved' version will be for real. I think people who buy this should get a refund for the trash they were led to believe was digitally mastered. If memory serves I don't even think the ending was complete. Boo.
B000K7VHQE|1.0|Okay, lessee here... we have a suicidal uncle, a junky grandfather with a nasty mouth, a teenage brother who hates everybody so much that he hasn't uttered a word in 9 months, and a father whose dreams keep going up in smoke.  Oh yeah, that's a real hoot. NOT!  I found the first 95 minutes or so of this movie depressing, not funny.  Not even mildly amusing.  The dance scene near the end was kind of funny, and it was nice that some of the family found some common bond and became a little less dysfunctional at the end.  But it wasn't worth sitting through the first hour and a half to get there.  I've never rated a movie worse than \\"okay\\" before, but this was possibly the worst I've ever seen.  On the plus side, Abigail Breslin is very talented.  She was wasted in this bomb.

B000IU3XTM|2.0|Yeh I loved \\"O.\\"  But then the more I heard it, the less it stood up to the rest of the CDs on the rack at home - the careers     of people like Dylan, Cohen, Bowie, Bob Mould.  Even artists with much fewer albums than these luminaries, such as Cat Powers     or Ani Di Franco, demonstrate far more ability as singer-songwriters, lyricists, players, and frankly, people to whom you can     say \\"Yeh you suffer but you also achieve and succeed, you help me through the tough times but you also help me into great     times, too.\\"    So by the time \\"9\\" came out, I had already been cured of my initial reaction to Damien Rice.  In fact, as I write this, I     can't recall much about a single song from \\"9\\" despite repeated listenings.  It's that forgettable, formulaic, and     predictable.    Why is Damien so hurt he can't just sing, without this hurt scarred whisper and the sharp intake of breath as if he's just     burned his hand on a zippo?  What's this idea that a whisper to shout is some new technique?  It can really be ridden into     the ground like an old eastern European car, if it's not used carefully.  Damien sure has burnt out the clutch on this one.    I read someone gabble on about the 20+ minute \\"opus\\" called 'Sleep don't weep.'  Eh?  Hang on a second, there, lads, the song     is only actually about five and a half minutes long.  The other 15 minutes is mainly one note strung out.  Here was I     expecting a hidden track or a real twenty minute masterpiece like something off a late Dylan album.  Ha!  What is this?  Did     he get his neighbours' kids to run wet fingertips around a bunch of half-filled wine glasses?  Please....

One wrong decision,<br /><br />and your buddy might die. It's this fact that makes the army work. That's<br /><br />the big mistake a lot of people make when they wonder how soldiers<br /><br />can put their lives on the line day after day or how they can fight for<br /><br />something they may not believe in. Not everyone does. I've worked with<br /><br />soldiers on all sides of the political spectrum; I've met some who hated<br /><br />the army and others who wanted to make it a career. I've met geniuses<br /><br />and idiots, but when all is said and done, we do what we do for one<br /><br />another. For friendship. Not for country, not for patriotism, not because<br /><br />we're programmed killing machines, but because of the guy next to you.<br /><br />You fight for your friend, to keep him alive, and he fights for you, and<br /><br />everything about the army is built on this simple premise.<br /><br />* She smiled, flashing the small gap between her two front teeth. \\"Exactly.<br /><br />It can be coins or sports or politics or horses or music or faith . . . the<br /><br />saddest people I've ever met in life are the ones who don't care deeply about<br /><br />anything at all. Passion and satisfaction go hand in hand, and without them,<br /><br />any happiness is only temporary, because there's nothing to make it last.<br /><br />I'd love to hear your dad talk about coins, because that's when you see a<br /><br />person at his best, and I've found that someone else's happiness is usually<br /><br />infectious.\\"<br /><br />I was struck by her words. Despite Tim's opinion that she was naïve, she<br /><br />seemed far more mature than most people our age.

I couldn't think of anyone who remotely resembled<br /><br />her in appearance or personality, and I wondered again why she'd taken<br /><br />a likingto me. We were as different as two people could be. She was a<br /><br />mountain girl, gifted and sweet, raised by attentive parents, with a desire<br /><br />to help those in need; I was a tattooed army grunt, hard around the edges,<br /><br />and largely a stranger in my own home.

B000K7VHQE|4.0|Little Miss Sunshine is the surprise indie hit of my 2006 movie watching year. Written by Michael Arndt and directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, this is not a slick Hollywood formulaic movie, but a very endearing and comedic glimpse of a lovable dysfunctional family from New Mexico that sets out for a trip to California for their daughter to vie in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant.  Traveling in a 1960s type hippie van that requires a running push by the family to start, the family encounters comical, yet life-changing events along the way.<br /><br />The characters feel like louder versions of people we all know and want to love, despite their wacky idiosyncrasies.  The family includes a cantankerous, sex-crazed grandfather played brilliantly by Alan Arkin, who was kicked out of the old folks home, and coaches his granddaughter in her talent presentation for the pageant. Greg Kinnear plays the frustrated father and creator of his own life coach business.  Toni Collette plays his wife, hard-working mother, patient as a saint, glue that holds this family together.  Abigail Breslin is adorable and full of hope as Olive.  Steve Carrell plays her uncle, with Paul Dano as the maudlin, self-imposed mute, big brother.<br /><br />As they make the trip to California, something happens that changes their lives.  But they don't understand how much their lives are affected until they reach the pageant, and realize that they all really are winners and do know how to let the sunshine in.<br /><br />- Victoria Austin
0800141660|2.0|Yes, this is a very lame production. Maybe I'm in a minority of one, but I find Emma Thompson to be an atrocious actress, in the same way as, for example, Katherine Hepburn, of an earlier generation. They just can't shed their real-life selves. So, in this movie, we have Ms Thompson pretending to be a Jane Austen heroine, and the pretense is there for all to see, all the time. She does not persuade me for one fleeting second that she is Elinor Dashwood. By way of contrast, I'll mention a couple of names that spring to mind who almost invariably convince, in whatever role -- Paul Giamatti and Billy Bob Thornton. They manage to suppress their personalities in such a way as to inhabit the character to just such a degree that he becomes credible. Ms Thompson is, sad to say, ever and always herself. It's not for nothing that the writer Frank Harris called acting a \\"half-art\\" -- the reason being that, in his view, anyone with a strong personality can't lose himself enough. Ms Thompson is prey to precisely this self-consciousness. Irene Richard, no beauty herself, wears the role of Elinor like a glove in the 1985 BBC production, a most subtle and self-effacing portrayal by an under-rated actress.  <br /> <br />Enough about Thompson. Hugh Grant is wooden, quite an achievement by Ang Lee with an actor usually known for his suave manner. Kate Winslet is a very limp romantic, and can't compare to the glowing Tracey Childs in the 1985 BBC production.  <br /> <br />It's true that the pictures are prettier in the movie version. And that the youngest Dashwood sister is awol for the BBC. Big deal. Go for the BBC production.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|This is a dark comedy with a dysfunctional family as the subject.  The story is set in a Volswagen van on a trip to California for the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant.  The trip is a mix of angst and humor for all the characters except Olive, the Little Miss Sunshine contestant.  From total dysfunction to a rag-tag family in a couple of hours.  You have to be smart to understand this film and able to laugh at the on screen dysfunction because it is an accurate depiction of American families today.  It ain't Disney so don't expect mindless entertainment.  Put on your thinking cap and get ready to laugh!
B00000DFSK|5.0|The negative reviews of this album are actually what made me want it.  Since it's for casual U2 fans only, which is what I am.  I really love a bunch of the songs on here.  Some of the songs seem oddly placed though, as if they couldn't possibly be part of the best during this time period.  For example,  \\"When Love Comes To Town\\" just outright sucks.  However, I hate blues, so it's understandable.
B000002J29|3.0|The sound is a bit \\"flat\\" if you see what I mean. I agree with some of the reviewer, the bass is hard to find sometimes, and the guitar is flat.<br /><br />There are songs that I just hate on this album, even if I love the studio version of these same songs.  The best example is \\"The lamb lies down\\", I think that it is a bad version, the vocal are horrible and the music is not better. I don't like \\"Robbery, Assault and battery\\" and \\"I know what I like\\"..Also, cutting \\"Dance on the volcano\\" was not a good idea, the best part of this song is not there (the ending section)<br /><br />Now, let's give the good news, Firth of fifth is incredible, Supper's ready is well done also and The cinema Show is amazing. Good live version of Los Endos. Squonk and Carpet Crawlers are just OK, but the studio version are better.  Overall, I am 50% satisfied with this double live album, hence the mid point rating.
B000002UZ4|5.0|You cannot hate these guys.  Sure they get a little silly with the lyrics at times but what they do well is make catchy pop/dance music and they don't stray.  At no point in history of the band has this simple concept been forgotten.  They do what they do best and that's enough for this listener.<br /><br />A song like 'Being Boring' is just plain amazing.  But there's lots and lots more.  If you love anything about 80s pop music then you will not be wasting one penny on this stellar collection.  It's the first 18 singles the band released. Even today I'm in awe of the consistency of this band.

And, the title track, 'Morph the Cat' -- \\"Christmas without the chintzy stuff\\"  a line that held amazing clarity for me as I got the cd mid November.  While driving in my car at night gazing at all the light-up Santas' positioned a foot away from the 3 Wise Men and the inflatable reindeer, Fagen said it all in that one line.  Get the CD.  If you're a Fagen or Dan fan, you know what you're looking for and the CD delivers

The best tracks, in my opinion, are Dance on a volcano, Entangled, Squonk, Mad Man Moon, Ripples and Los Endos.  A classic from prog rock of the 70's and a must have for any prog music fan.

Binoche and Dame Dench have such great charisma on-screen and, if one could say between women, great chemistry and presence with one another. I felt welcomed into her shop as well as I also felt the \\"chill\\" in the town until the situation \\"warmed-up\\" a bit. I have had a small \\"thing\\" for Depp for a while and really enjoyed his character in this movie.

0393327345|5.0|`Fight Club' to me was one of those novels you read not expecting much more than mundane violence and tyrannical elements of surprise and suspense.  If you've had the pleasure of watching the Hollywood blockbuster bearing the same name you'd know that it's so much more than that.  `Fight Club', above all else, is about the conflict within us for acceptance, acceptance from our peers, from our loved ones and yes, from ourselves.  It's about the struggle for complacence, the human struggle for satisfaction and that feeling of self worth.  This story's protagonist is far from any of these things.<br /><br />`Fight Clubs' nameless narrator suffers from abnormal depression.  He hates his job, his life and himself in more ways than you can imagine.  The only sliver of enjoyment he receives comes in the form of his apartment which he spends countless hours and dollars refurbishing until it looks just like the cover of a magazine.  He hasn't slept in god knows how long and it's taking a toll on his very being so, in an attempt to find some sort of inner peace, he relishes in the misfortunes of others by attending a series of support-group meetings.  Here he has a chance to release his inner emotions, crying between the breasts of a man with testicular cancer.  Doing this makes his feel whole, feel complete, and thus he receives his best night sleep in years.<br /><br />That is all before he meets Marla Singer.  Marla, like our narrator, is a faker, a self-group junkie who just so happens to show up and ruin a good thing.  You see, knowing that someone else is getting as much satisfaction as he is out of such a deplorable act is causing him to lose that much needed sleep.  But then everything changes when someone else waltzes into his life...and that man is Tyler Durden.  After a series of events (you notice how the one good thing in our narrators life, the one thing he is proud of, his gorgeous apartment is the first thing to go) the two men begin their new life which consists of `Fight Club' an underground fighting ring where the everyday man, fed up with his job, his wife, his kids or himself can beat our his frustration and sleep happy.<br /><br />Things start wonderfully but soon escalate out of control and must come to a brilliantly twisted ending that will still leave you speechless even if you have been spoiled by seeing the film first.  Honestly, I didn't even know this novel existed until years after seeing the movie and yet when I read the final page of this novel I think I was even more blown away than I was sitting in the crowed theater.  Chuck Palahniuk is a masterful storyteller and he weaves this tale so thick with gritty realism that the reader can't help but relate and sympathize with the characters.  This is definitely the novel for the reading man.  It speaks to us on so many levels because it addresses the very thing that so many men are afraid to confront, that feeling of worthless, lonely dissatisfaction that can erode the very fabric of our lives and make us hate who and what we are.

B000001FDQ|3.0|I would consider myself a casual fan of Yngwie, and guitar shredders rarely make it into my CD collection at all. Rising Force contains some quality playing and interesting song structures, but I feel that it is artistically dated at this point. Yngwie became a much better player in later years, and seeing him in the G3 DVD was mind-blowing. Going from that to Rising Force made it easy to see his improvement. The album is a classic for guitarists, but the guitar work is clearly not up to par with Malmsteen's more recent material (which is really a good thing when you think about it). Also, the production seems rather mediocre and muffled, making the potentially exciting songs sound dead. Basically, if you're a big Yngwie fan, you'll want it, but if you just want to hear some amazing playing, go for his stuff at G3 instead.

B000FZERIG|4.0|This album suffers from being the follow-up to one of the best albums in all of rock. All Things Must Pass is as good as everyone says, if you haven't heard it yet then you need to seek it out. Despite what some critics and fans would have you believe, Living In The Material World is a worthy successor.  <br /> <br />At only one disc, it obviously isn't as sprawling as ATMP. The music isn't as varied, staying mostly in the vein of bluesy rock and soaring ballads. The Indian/Eastern vibe is also downplayed here, appearing most notably on the bridges of the title track. The lyrics are for the most part uplifting, with a fair dose of George's witty and sarcastic humor. The result is a very cohesive, catchy, and spiritual disc of post-Beatles rock and pop. <br /> <br />This album contains one of Harrison's biggest hits (\\"Give Me Love (Give Me Peace On Earth)\\"), some fantastic guitar work (Harrison played all the guitars on the album himself), and some of the most beautiful songs he has ever written (\\"That Is All,\\" \\"Be Here Now,\\" \\"Don't Let Me Wait Too Long,\\" \\"The Day The World Gets Round,\\" really just about every ballad here is gorgeous!), yet because it clearly isn't All Things Must Pass Volume Two, some people still consider it a disappointment. It has aged MUCH better than some of the albums that followed it, and in my opinion is probably his strongest work after ATMP. <br /> <br />The remastered version sounds wonderful, but the two extra tracks don't really add a lot. Deep Blue is a great song, but just doesn't seem to fit here. Miss Odell is mostly forgetable, but it always brings a smile to my face to hear George screw up the words and laugh about it. The booklet is very nice, with extensive liner notes, lyrics, and lots of pictures. <br /> <br />If you have ATMP and are unsure where to go next, this would be a wise choice. If you're a George Harrison fan and you don't have this album, you definitely need it. If you're new to his solo work and don't feel like diving right into the intimidating ATMP, this would be a good disc to test the waters with. Basically, if you're a fan of George, The Beatles, or just good old rock and pop, this is a great addition to any CD collection.
B000J103PC|5.0|This is one of Meryl Streeps best performances, and she has had many. I highly recommend it for the MS fan, or anyone who wants a good laugh.

B00002SWEM|5.0|I am very happy with the quality and the quick delivery of my order.
B000068CNX|5.0|For any Friends fan, this season is a must for your collection. This season particularly is my favorite for many reasons. To state a few, the beginning of the Ross & Rachel relationship where you discover the great chemistry they share, Joey & Chandlers downfall of their friendship when Joey moves out after being discovered of his acting to become a star on Days of Our Lives, and overall this season has the best jokes and memorable story lines. All though there is a place in my heart that also adores season four and season eight because of their wonderful arcs including Phoebe being a surrogate mother and Rachel's pregnancy, season two still takes the cake.  <br /> <br />Favorite Episode: \\"The One Where Eddie Moves In\\" <br />--This episode was probably the funniest storyline through out the series and it was my all time favorite episode of the entire ten-season run. It was a close race with \\"The One Where Everyone Finds Out\\" and \\"The One With the Embryos\\". I love \\"The One Where Eddie Moves In\\" for two reasons: the first being Phoebe's discovery as a singer by a producer who wants to make a music video for her song \\"Smelly Cat\\". It is so hilarious when Rachel, Ross, and Monica sit on the couch in the room with Phoebe to watch her music video and the reactions of them all when they hear Phoebes 'fake' voice. I love how Phoebe thinks that is actually her singing and her comments like, \\"Sorry guys but I sound incredible!\\" It's just priceless and extremely funny. The second reason is the separation of Joey and Chandler when they realize how hard it is to live apart from each other. A great scene is when they play the song \\"All By Myself\\" during a silent sequence of Joey and Chandler thinking about each other. It's overall just a fantastic episode. Besides this episode there are many other great ones like, \\"The One With the Prom Video\\" and \\"The One With the Lesbian Wedding.\\" Buy this season! You will not regret it! <br />
B0007Y08IS|2.0|I waited until now to purchase 'Team America' the unrated version just when it was the right price. I got for $4.99. I have read the reviews and spoke to friends who had seen it and thought it might be worth owning it. I was wrong....upon watching it I realized it just wasn't that funny. Sure an occasional laugh here and there and ofcourse the sex scene was out of this world but that was it. I must admit the puppet masters did a great job but is this film worth watching more than once....I don't think so.
6305212112|5.0|This is a must-add to your DVD library. A wonderfully heart-touching and charming movie that keeps your attention to the last frame.
B000002GK1|5.0|I really enjoyed the mind trip to my youth.  Boy Scouts just wouldn't have been the same with out the Jesus Christ Pose.
B0000AISLP|5.0|I just replaced my VHS copy with this version - I wanted widescreen and Dolby 5.1 and I wasn't dissapointed. It comes with a second DVD filled with extras and if your a fan of this movie you will enjoy the interviews with various people involved with its making.
B000BFH2S2|3.0|Until I bought this DVD, I was an adoring Michael Buble fan. I listened to his music nonstop. I couldn't wait to see his face as he sang what had become my favorite songs. I cannot describe my disappointment at finding that what should have been a class-act show was filled with lewd, crass humor and profanity. No, I'm not a prude. I'm the same age as Michael and can't believe he is still talking, behaving, and thinking like a hormone-intoxicated 13-year-old boy. A (very) few things he said were funny, but 90% of what he did not sing was awful and embarrassing. Just look at the faces of the band members as he's saying things like \\"MOFO.\\" He sang superbly. And still managed to inject profanity into his ad-libbed lyrics. Who is managing this guy? I hope he realizes how great Michael COULD HAVE BEEN if his stage persona only fit the image his music suggests. He doesn't have to be a monk or anything. Just leave the trashy language and crude remarks out of the shows, especially one that is being videotaped to sell as a DVD! Readers: Take my advice and stick with the CD's. So you can keep liking him. I haven't listened to a MB song since.
B000J10ERO|5.0|There's not much I can say about this movie except that I enjoyed it so much I was speechless when it was over..
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Daniel Craig is incredible as 007 in this flagship film!  No more pretty boy assassins.  Craig is not only gorgeous, he is uber-believable as the secret agent with license to kill!<br /><br />This is the story of how Bond became Bond.  The locations are varied and beautiful.  The characters are more solid and less fluff than previous Bond efforts.  And let's face it, the stunt runner at the beginning of the film was fantastic!!!<br /><br />I saw this one twice in the theater, and will watch it over and over again!
B000B8QG4A|5.0|One of Disney's best and a joy to share with my daughter and her 7 and 8 year-olds!
B0006A9FKA|4.0|Quirky, odd, fast paced and funny with a horror movie twist. In typical British fashion this movie is a great escape for a few hours to a what if kind of world. If you like british humor you should love this movie. Its light and fluffy.

B000K7VHQE|1.0|This movie SUCKED.  Not one good thing to say about it.  Foul language, zero to no funny parts. Sad, depressing.  STUPID!!!!! Don't waste your time or money.  Spend time cleaning your toilet instead. You'll be better off and it will be more enjoyable I promise.
B000B5XOSO|5.0|Like the previous reviewer I saw this on TV last night also, but otherwise my experience was very different than his, because for me, Michelle Pfeiffer's fantastic performance as Catwoman/Selina Kyle WAS enough to hold the whole messy movie together.  And a lot of the credit for her work must go to Tim Burton and his artists, who in every frame made her look attractive or demented or sympathetic or the reverse, every beat thought out ahead of time and then allowed for.  The pink phone in Selina's apartment, the doll house she destroys with a can of black spray paint.  Her sewing machine that she runs a catwoman costume on, complete with claws she attaches to the fingertips.  The rip in the left shoulder of her beige outfit when Christopher Walken attacks her and the cats bring her back to life in the snow.<br /><br />Even the snow itself, so obviously fake, so besutifully flying around her face and body as she lies supine on her back while the cats crawl around her and, apparently, eliciting sparks of movement from her, even that snow seems designed to make us feel, on some level, that it isn't really cold and it won't really be hurting the body of our beloved Michelle Pfeiffer, even when we think she's dead.<br /><br />The way she pours the carton of milk over her cat's bowl and much more of it comes out than would if she were sane and had motor control.  Then she brings the carton to her exquisite, bruised lips, and the white milk plunges like a facial all over her chin, throat, and lapels.  \\"Honey, I'm home,\\" she cries out, like one at the end of her tether, without a single drop of energy left, blood oozing from her forehead.  Has abuse ever been so graphically felt in a movie before?  The camera seems to know exactly where to land next in order to capture every nuance of her twitches and turns.  Set design in excelsis.  And yet, I wonder what would happen if i didn't know the back story and that she would become Catwoman.  Say it was some Persian or Andalusian story that wasn't as familiar to me as the back of my hand.  Would I ever really think that Selina Kyle would transform herself into Catwoman?  The development is supposed to shock, I think, and of course it fails to do that, it's too ingrained in our comic book reading subconscious.  Still Pfeiffer manages to find some shocking elements in the particulars of the situation.  She even makes Selina mousy, and rewinding and watching again and again exactly how she manages this (by holding her mouth in a special grimace, I believe aided by some sort of cotton-based prosthetic under her lower lip) is an education in great acting all by itself.<br /><br />Even if Batman wasn't in the movie at all it would still be a masterpiece.  Crazy that Pfeiffer was nominated for an Oscar that year, but not for this, instead for her work in the boring LOVE FIELD.  No wonder Emma Thompson won, but she stole it from Selina Kyle.ian story that wasn't as familiar to me as the back of my hand.

B0002IVN9W|1.0|OK, I don't get it. This album is noisy, odd, and disjointed, and the vocals are weak and annoying. Am I missing something? It didn't impress me when I bought it, so I put it aside for a few months. I justed picked it up again today, after reading an article about the band in a recent issue of MOJO. I just don't hear anything that impresses me at all. I'd nominate this for most overrated album of the new century.
0618680004|1.0|We've heard these arguments before.  <br />I personally don't have a problem rejecting biblical or koranic literalism, but rejecting that there could be something intelligent governing the universe is much harder. <br />The fundamental contradiction in Dawkins' argument is his free admittance that undertsanding the cosmos and creation may be beyond our intellect, but on the other hand you can all but reject the possibility of God by using easy to understand logical reason. To me that's a very subtantial contradiction.  <br />For that reason, this book does not, and cannot discount the possibility that God could be something transcendent - beyond creation. The truth of the matter is that Dawkins sets out from the position that he does not want to believe in God. <br />Something created the universe - the only difference between atheists and theists is an argument over whether it's intelligent. <br />Science really gives no reason to reject the idea that it might be either. <br />The style of the book is also rather unpleasant, conveying, ironically, some of the mocking conviction and righteousness of a true believer. <br />Dawkins would have done better if he had attacked religious literalism (a more worthy target, in my humble opinion), but instead he chose to go straight for the notion that there may be a God, trotting out the old, timeworn and lazy arguments that religion makes people fight each other. <br />Ultimately Dawkins has achieved something in so far as he's made himself even richer, but I think in the eyes of the more critical amongst us he's also made himself look a bit silly, and a little bit like the firebrand Imams and Evangelists he despises.
1400064287|5.0|Great book.  This book is as entertaining as it is practical.  A rare combination. <br /> <br />The brothers Heath have formalized the most vexing problem for experts (and pseudo-experts) seeking to broadly and effectively transmit their ideas.  By first formalizing and then cracking 'the curse of knowledge', the Heaths give you THE template for effective idea dissemination. <br /> <br />This book is a must read for anyone seeking to influence people through ideas.  Whether you're a litigator seeking to influence a judge or a jury, a researcher looking to build consensus among your peers, a propagandist trying to win an election in an undeveloped nation, a teacher attempting to reach distracted, hormone-crazed 7th graders, one of the inept creatives who blighted us with this year's Super Bowl commercials or a CEO trying to lead a multi-national organization, you HAVE to read this book.  I assure you your competitors will. <br />

B000E97HIA|5.0|I'm watching the Grammy Awards and a commercial comes on...it's Prince thanking the people who watched him perform at the Super Bowl.  It was a very nice message, and he paid a lot of money just to do it.  That's a real gentleman. When was the last time YOUR favorite artist dropped that kind of money to thank YOU?
1582701709|5.0|The Secret was recently featured on The Oprah Winfrey Show.  Now the book and DVD are among the top sellers on Amazon.  With all this exposure, the Universal Truths featured in The Secret are becoming more mainstream.  The consciousness of humanity will blossom and the human race will become more empowered to live a life of joy, peace and happiness.  All the people who lack inner peace that currently control humanity will fall away, never to return.  The Secret is a wonderful book to serve as the starting point to the 6 books of Dr. David R. Hawkins, the 2 books by Gary Renard and the new book by Eckhard Tolle.  In my opinion, these books (along with The Secret) will transform humanity more than anything else.

B0007LXPBI|5.0|I saw this movie once on the Disney Channel and being a full fledged adult of 25 years old - I  tend to approach Disney movies with some skpeticism but this movie has just the right mix of comedy, drama and romance to make this a winner. Lindsay Lohan's dual portrayal of the twins is excellent and the flavor is rich and robust with echoes of the past around every corner. Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson are also entirely lovable as parents and starred crossed lovers of the future. I recommend this movie for anyone whose a hopeless romantic by nature like myself.

B0000787FH|5.0|My favorite album is IMPERIAL BEDROOM by Elvis Costello because it has a spectacular sound. Elvis Costello has always been a great lyricist and this album show us why.Songs like Almost Blue,The Long Honeymoon,Man out of time, and just about every other song in this album is an instant classic.IMPERIAL BEDROOM is Elvis Costello's masterpiece. I would even go as far as to say that IMPERIAL BEDROOM is the greatest album of all time.Iknow that would make a BEATLE MANIAC angry at me,but i have listen to SGT.PEPPER LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND so many times before and i'm just not impress by it at all.I think it's overrated don't get me wrong it's not a bad album,but i just think IMPERIAL BEDROOM BLOWS IT AWAY BY A LOT OF MILES!!!
0679446230|5.0|I was loaned this book by a Kenyan friend of mine.  Anyone who wants to know more about western Africa should start here.  The terse prose reminds me a lot of Hemingway.  I bought two copies:  the fancy one to give as a gift to my friend and the paperback to keep in my own library.  This is one of the few books I will pass along to my progeny.  It is that important.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|An absolutely brilliant concert dvd/cd package.  The concert is certainly in the same league as Blonde Ambition and the Girlie Show. In fact, it is probably Madonna's best tour ever.  It was extremely entertaining from start to finish and would have been a great show to see live, unfortunately she didn't make it to Australia.  For me, I found Music Inferno to be the highlight of the concert, but overall it was fantastic and very entertaining.  The live cd is also very, very good from start to finish.
0307237699|5.0|First... I want to point out something that is very clear looking at this review thread. <br /> <br />I have read most of the reviews and have found that there are alot of great summaries given so to make a decision whether to purchase the book or not.  <br />That being said...I also noticed that very good \\"reviews\\" that are slanted towards favoring the book and the author were given VERY low \\"helpful\\" votes. This is a disgrace as this is a book REVIEW DISCUSSION....NOT A POLITICAL DISCUSSION. Just because you are a republican gives you no reason to put a person down for giving a good review of the book. I guess if Limbaugh wrote it and someone gave a good review it would be \\"helpful\\"....am i right? <br /> <br />I am disgusted with these people, so much so that i want to stop writing and re-read this great book written by a great Future President !! (Gottcha)
1582701709|5.0|Though I have read other books on this subject matter, this is by far the best written and well presented than other books. It has more quotes from experts and information is given in tidbits fashion which makes it easier to read and grasp. Other writers have the tendency playing with words just to fill in the pages. This book is precise and right to the point.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|A nice, tidy ending to the groundbeaking Matrix phenomenon.
B000FA57RG|3.0|On the DVD:<br /><br />It's no Truth or Dare but interesting enough to see how different Madonna is now that she's become a mother.  Her interaction with the camera and crew is less iconic and much more respectable.  It's a completely different documentary from Truth or Dare; so, don't expect the same.  This is probably something you'd more likely see in an independent theater than in a Regal Cinemas.  I feel it is much less captivating ... but then the mystery and intrigue behind Madonna washed away after the birth of her first child.  She's fascinating nonetheless and you get glimpses of her genius in parts of the film.<br /><br />Very well directed.  Seemingly less concert footage than Truth or Dare but musical enough.  Nobody Knows Me is a particular standout.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Chock full of 'cool fighting' and 'smart talking'.  I know many people did not much care for this one, but I prefer a movie that makes me think.
B000002UDB|5.0|It's hard to say which Beatles album is the best, but I'd put Magical Mystery tour up there with Sgt. Pepper's, Abbey Road, Revolver and Rubber Soul. <br /> <br />Almost every song is one of your favorites.
B000000OAC|5.0|The heaviest rock since the early days for Queen and plays well after 30 years of aging.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Funny, I put off buying this collection for several years, partly because of price and partly because I thought it was just going to be more of the same old thing that I had seen or heard before.   <br />As far as the price goes I got it at Amazon new for less than I had saw it for used on e-bay plus I got free shipping,  I am really pleased with the price.    <br />As far as the contents of the collection goes there was a lot of the some old thing, but a ton of things that I hadn't seen or heard before, like great concert footage and television appearances. The thing that was really enjoyable for me was the interviews that Paul, George and Ringo did for the collection separately and together.  Hearing the same story from each of their perspectives was very insightful and in some cases very funny.  I think that this collection is a must for every Beatles fan.  I am so glad that I finally broke down and spent the money..  <br />
B000000OAA|5.0|Worth it alone for May's Brighton Rock guitar sound. Also the breakthru with Killer Queen. Other highlights include, in the lap of the gods revisited and fan favorite Now I'm Here.

B000000OAN|5.0|The tapes are analog here, worn thin with the million overdubs and the songs are generally getting better. Highlights are The Prophets song it's the echoplex vocal orchestra of Mercury, underrated also is Sweet Lady and Good Company featuring May's guitar \\"jazz band\\" done with overdubs and a battery powered amp called the \\"deacy\\".
B000AYNFWG|5.0|LA DOLCE VITA is, perhaps, Federico Fellini at his finest hour.  This film is an honest, sobering and insightful look at the personal struggle of one man (Marcello Mastroianni) and the personal shadows he must continually box in order to carve out a shallow existence in the world.  On the surface, he is a high rolling and womanizing journalist living 'the charmed life.'  He has connections to parties, enough women to keep him occupied every night of the week and an inside view on the most exclusive social circles.  Yet, he is a miserable man.  Almost every aspect of his life leaves him unsatisfied.<br /><br />The imagery in this film and the ironic title (LA DOLCE VITA--English translation:  THE SWEET LIFE) are really thought provoking.  Of course, one of the most well-known scenes takes place in the Trevi Fountain with Marcello (Mastrioianni) and the voluptuous actress, played by Anita Ekberg, frolicking in the water with a kitten.  It's at once surreal and perhaps one of the most spontaneous scenes in the film.  There are also scenes of the Italian skyline (including the Jesus imagery at the beginning).  Fellini is really a fantastic storyteller and this film covers the bases of everything from decadence to depression, as well as the personal struggle of one man in his quest to find purpose in his life, yet, consecutively comes up short in whatever route he seeks out for himself.  This is a path all too commonly travelled by many (if not all) of us.  This is truly one of the most beautiful and also the most disturbing films I have seen.
0446677450|3.0|This book is a good motivating tool. It gives you the sense that you don't have to be beholden to the man. On the other hand, it wont guide you on how to do that.<br /><br />Read the book, then read the scathing reviews of R. Kiyosaki and his connections with pyramid schemes, contradictions etc...<br /><br />The stories in the book are interesting, and motivational. Take the good points out of it and ignore the bad.
B000002HJD|5.0|Jim Morrison was a poet at heart, losing himself in writing long before becoming a famous rock star.  This album reflects the true spirit of Jim Morrison and is a must have for any Morrison fan.  Get lost in his words and his world. Lose yourself in the young child's fragile eggshell mind as Jim tells you stories of his earliest childhood memories and shares his deepest thoughts and fears in the last months of his life.
B00005B36H|3.0|I'm still not sure why I bought this album. \\"Schism\\" sounded refreshingly different when I heard it on the radio years ago and after stumbling upon this page, hearing the weird song snippets, and reading about how great and deep this album was, I decided to buy it and give it a listen, and if I didn't like it well I wouldn't be surprised. I knew what I was getting into based on what I'd read here: \\"Listen to it multiple times before judging it, clear your mind, get out a ouija  board and tarot cards to interpret the lyrics\\" etc. <br /> <br />Even after all that prep I still found the music disturbing and scary, even after multiple listens. This is thanks in large part to Tool's ability to create sound landscapes that they call songs. Mostly they just repeat the same beat for an entire song, occasionally breaking up the monotony with strange sounds or lyrics. The lyrics on this album are very poor with the exception of \\"Schism\\" and feel tacked on. You get the feeling Tool would have loved to do 13 instrumental tracks but that wouldn't go over well with the record company. Each individual song is so long you can skip ahead 2-3 minutes and not feel like you've missed a thing because the songs all take time to get going, if they ever do. I liked \\"Parabola\\", \\"Schism\\", \\"Disposition\\", and \\"The Patient\\", about medical ethics and possibly euthanasia \\"Triad\\" is the one purely instrumental song on the album, and it's one of the few that doesn't drag. \\"Faaip De Oiad\\" isn't really a song, but its message will stick in your brain. An album that is equally long, creepy, and boring, but not deep or memorable.
B00005J79H|4.0|this cd is of great quality as to be expected by the scorpions. the acoustic versions of their classic songs are all too brilliant.i will say though that i didnt like the versions of always somewhere and still loving you,much preferring the originals.my last word will be to say that the cover songs are of great standard,dust in the wind,especially.just make a point of listening to the version of queens love of my life and the cars drive,how fantastic.....baz

B00003CXRM|5.0|OK. I've decided once and for all not to waste peoples' time and give a synopsis of each movie, knowing that it's already been done by the Plot Synopsis.    With that said...one of the things one can appreciate is seeing an actor play a character with a style and personality that he/she hasn't performed before.  Such is the case with George Clooney in \\"O Brother Where Art Thou\\".  In all the films and television shows I've seen that have included George Clooney, I've never seen him perform this character before.  A proud man Everrett, who sees himself as intellegent in the field of modernization and science.  But his world is thrown off balance when he, and his traveling companions Delmar and Pete, set off for home on a path that requires more faith than scepticism.  Homer's \\"The Odyssey\\" is well adapted, including a blind railway worker as the seer, three prostitutes as the Sirens, and a con man as the Cyclops.    The movie caused me to pick up Homer's \\"The Odyssey\\", translated by Robert Fagles.  It's a very moving and exciting read if you have some time on your hands.    Going back to acting, John Turturro's performance is classic.  He maintains the role of a hot-headed escaped prisoner throughout the movie.  And the singing, hillbilly scene with Tim Blake Nelson is hilarious.  Contrast this with his role as the slimy brother in \\"Miller's Crossing\\".    What is amazing is that the music is so well fitted for the plot.  Gospel and blues accompany the escaped convics as they travel seeking a hidden treasure, and is quite appropriate considering the spiritual journey the men are faced with.  It's interesting how Everrett takes a 180 degree turnabout regarding faith, then is quick to dismiss it minutes later.    The soundtract is worth getting, and the DVD companion \\"Down From the Mountain\\" is fun to watch.
B00005JPDP|5.0|How exactly do you make a movie about smells? After all, a movie is all about sight and sound. Touch, taste and smell rarely come into it.<br /><br />But acclaimed German director Tom Tykwer manages to make us smell things, in his most disturbing movie to date, \\"Perfume: The Story of a Murderer.\\" This time around, the talented Tykwer abandons his usual lovers-against-the-world stories for a lushly-filmed, darkly comic story of olfactory obsession. Yes, that is what I said.<br /><br />Jean-Baptiste Grenouillle (Ben Whishaw) is a man with a brilliant sense of smell, and zero body odor. He was born in a putrid fishmarket, raised in an orphanage, and later escapes from a tannery where he was working. He's enraptured by the many thrilling smells in the city -- he even kills a young girl, so that he can smell her lovely scent.<br /><br />In his search for the perfect scent, Jean-Baptiste gets a job with a once-famed perfume-maker (Dustin Hoffman). But after learning that not everything has a scent, he begins killing women to try to distill their scents into the ultimate perfume -- with beautiful redhead Laura (Rachel Hurd-Wood) as the \\"thirteenth scent.\\" But his ultimate scent has an even more sinister side, as his scents begin to affect the population in unusual ways.<br /><br />\\"Perfume\\" is Tykwer's most unique movie to date, and the one that definitely identifies him as a cinematic master. There are lots of music that are evocative, sensual, colourfully beautiful, or unspeakably creepy, but not many manage to be all of them. \\"Perfume: The Story of a Murderer\\" is all of those, and more.<br /><br />Obviously a movie doesn't smell like anything, except maybe stale popcorn. So Tykwer uses sight for smell -- rotted fish, maggots, moldy walls from the late 1700s to show Jean-Baptiste's miserable origins. And he uses sparkling colour and windblown trees for nicer scents. Colour takes the place of scent itself -- bright red Lola hair on multiple girls, flowers that seem to pop out of the screen, fresh leaves, brilliant fruits, even brightly coloured food. It gives the visuals a fairy-tale vibrancy.<br /><br />In fact, the scripting almost comes second to the exquisite cinematography. Yet Tykwer is able to bring across the powerful symbolism that brings the movie to life -- the smells are symbolic of love itself, which the scentless and amoral Jean-Baptiste does not have. He can only try to take it from others, with a finale that is the very image of poetic justice.<br /><br />Jean-Baptiste himself is one of those love/hate characters, and Whishaw does an excellent job with his sort of half-crazy, intent stare. And there are some great supporting performances by Alan Rickman as Antoine Richis (Laura's dad) and Hoffman as the eccentric old perfume-maker -- he adds a welcome note of comedy.<br /><br />A movie is dependent on sight, but Tom Tykwer creates a movie that you can almost smell. \\"Perfume: The Story of a Murderer\\" is darkly comic, bizarrely beautiful movie, and definitely worth seeing.hat seem to pop out of the screen, fresh leaves, brilliant fruits, even brightly coloured food.

0060922583|4.0|This book is an excellent summary of the theme where all is energy, and all things are equal [nonlocality], and where consciousness is energy. The examples are excellent, like Tia making the grove of trees disappear and come back again. The book is also consistent in its theme, and doesn't mix ideas that are contradictory. I would like to ask where does God [a heirarchical God as described in the Bible, most of the time anyway] fit into this. The answer is not stated in the book, but it is nevertheless easy to extrapolate. At the level that is discussed, there is no heirarchy, as all things are interconnected. Communication makes everything equal[even locations that are apparently separate]. So a holographic universe means there is no God who rules the universe. Rather, the universe is the average of all living things, and all living things contribute to its current state. So then this description [the holographic universe] is 'not God'. The question we must now ask, which is the reality and the truth. My guess is that the holographic universe is the truth, and that belief in a heirarchy is the illusion. Belief in 'God' [as a heirarchy]therefore perpetuates this illusion and keeps the mind of men imprisoned in a box. I feel this subject needs to be addressed at length, so that we can better understand what we are with respect to religion. <br />Well done on a most enjoyable book which will have tremendous ramifications for the human race in the future. It is where we are heading, back to where we come from. <br />
B000053V7Q|5.0|This is a really enjoyable DVD.  The King looks and sounds fabulous.  I love the shirts Elvis wears in his rehearsals.  He is and always will be the true King of all entertainment.  Elvis had a gift from God that has never been duplicated.  You can still feel the magnetism and closeness Elvis had with his audiences in these videos.  It's amazing that even 40 years later that connection is still evident with the viewing audiences of today.  Truly remarkable!

B000002HJD|4.0|James Douglas Morrison is known as a shaman, the lizard king, and lead singer of the Doors, but was also a poet who recorded some of his poems and stories. The result is a journey through the dark alleyways of Morrison's mind. Unfortunately, Morrison died prematurely at the age of 27 in a Parisian bathtub on July 3, 1971. However, the remaining three Doors members (Ray Manzarek, keyboards; Robby Krieger, guitar; John Densmore, drums) took the raw material and provided music to accompany Morrison's voice in a manner that is both deft and supportive of Morrison's poetry. Occasionally the music is overdone to the point of sounding like soft jazz or worse - a stereotypical porn soundtrack. The album, \\"An American Prayer,\\" was released in 1978; the remastered 1995 version has three bonus tracks. The most notable bonus track is the compelling and haunting \\"Bird of Prey\\" with Morrison singing a cappella, as if straight from the grave.    Do not expect a standard story with a narrative arc. \\"An American Prayer\\" is better heard as a cohesive mood that begs to be played in one sitting on a moonless night with a solitary candle. To explore the nightmare terrain, Morrison pens words the F.C.C. would not allow for public broadcast; nonetheless the word choice, for the most part, is effective and essential despite the vulgarity. At times the poetry can be trite as the following line from the title poem, \\"An American Prayer.\\" \\"Do you know we are ruled by T.V.\\" But more often the words are compelling for its imagery like the following gem from the title poem. \\"Death makes angels of us all & gives us wings where we had shoulders smooth as raven's claws.\\" The fallen world Morrison ushers the listener into is one full of confusion, madness, random acts of violence, sex and sudden death.    \\"An American Prayer\\" does contain a murderer on the loose (\\"The Hitchhiker\\") and it is Morrison himself. Dead Indian souls are ready to possess Morrison's childhood mind in \\"Newborn Awakening.\\" Barely above a whisper, Morrison says, \\"Indians scattered on dawn's highway bleeding/Ghosts crowd the young child's fragile eggshell mind.\\" Morrison's melancholic thoughts speak of a poet not well-adjusted. Morrison's voice is clear, but also has a worn edge to it. This is no surprise when you consider Morrison had become overweight, suffered a fallout and conviction from a 1969 Miami concert (Morrison is found guilty of profanity and exposing himself), and had countless paternity suits plaguing the end of his life.    In \\"Stoned Immaculate,\\" Morrison pleads, \\"Let me tell you about heartache and the loss of god,/Wandering, wandering in hopeless night.\\" And then later asks in \\"Lament,\\" \\"Could any hell be more horrible than now and real?\\" It is hard to argue with him after this beautiful tour of discord ends.

0618551050|5.0|One pattern that has emerged in the history of physics is that successful theories are really unifications of two things that were thought to be different. Copernicus unified stars with the sun; stars were just suns that happened to be very far away. Galileo and Newton unified motion with rest through the concept of inertia. String theory purports to unify quantum mechanics with relativity. The beauty of a good unification is that it provides one simple explanation for seemingly unrelated events.    But Smolin is quick to point out that the history of science is littered with failed unifications that were \\"too beautiful not to be true.\\" Kepler's original theory was that the orbits of planets were governed by geometric shapes - the platonic solids. It may seem silly to our modern sensibilities to expect that the radius of a planetary orbit should conform to a predetermined geometry, but Kepler was looking for a description of our universe in fundamental properties of mathematics and geometry. That is no different than what we do today looking for Grand Unified Theories of physics.    Kepler's theory was beautiful, but it was wrong. This is also true of modern theories. Particles are composed of two fundamental types: quarks and leptons. One very elegant theory that unified quarks with leptons is called SU(5). It neatly explains all the properties of the standard model, and makes a prediction that was not expected: that protons decay, albeit at a very slow rate. So scientists put a giant swimming pool deep underground to shield it from cosmic rays and watched for proton decay. It should have happened within a couple years, but decades later there has been no proton decay. Smolin writes that he is still shaken decades later that this elegant, beautiful theory is simply wrong.    The next section of the book addresses string theory. It began as extremely elegant beautiful theory. But it rapidly ran into problems, which led to it getting uglier and uglier. The final straw, at least for Smolin, came in 1998 with the discovery of dark energy. This provided experimental proof for a positive cosmological constant, which meant that the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate. Previously all string theories assumed the cosmological constant is either zero or negative. A group of Stanford physicists were able to salvage string theory, but the price was high: it resulted in the creation of a \\"landscape\\" of 10^500 different forms of string theory. Instead of being beautiful and elegant, even its proponents held that string theory was now a rube-goldberg device. They held this to be a virtue - looking for beauty in science was uncomfortably theological.    Smolin rejects this approach (and the theological approach). Science may not have to be beautiful but it does have to make testable predictions. The next section of the book discusses alternatives to string theory, including one line of research called \\"doubly special relativity.\\" Relativity is based on the idea that the speed of light appears the same to all observers. Doubly special relativity means that both the speed of light and the Planck length should appear the same to all observers. The Planck length is a minuscule length much smaller than the tiniest subatomic particle that makes the smallest possible size. The speed of light is a speed limit, so the Planck length is a size minimum. Another competing version of Doubly Special Relativity holds that high energy photons actually can go faster than the speed of light. This can actually be tested because if so, high energy photons from gamma-ray bursts from billions of light years away should arrive about a 1/1000th of a second earlier than lower energy photons.    The final section of the book is about the sociology of science. The gist is that there is no one \\"scientific method.\\" In the history of science, being falsified never stopped a theory. As one philosopher Smolin quotes put it, when you see a red swan, you look for theperson who painted it. In practice, most scientific advances were done be people who cut corners and took shortcuts pursuing their vision. Smolin uses the example of Galileo; the well-trained Jesuits poked holes into his reasoning. But Galileo's vision was correct even if some of arguments were not. Smolin's prescription for the trouble with physics is that we need to find a way to support and encourage the seers in science. They aren't always as technically accomplished as the craftsmen, but they are the ones with the original ideas that advance our understanding of the world.
6300181278|5.0|This atmospheric horror film based on the play adaptation of Braum Stoker's literary horror classic, still has enough going for it to make it one of the great films from the early days of talking pictures. Lugosi's portrayel of Dracula may seem a bit ripe at times when viewed today, but it is part of the charm of this horror masterpiece.<br /><br />Producer Carl Laemmle brought director Tod Browning in to film Garrett Fort's script of the play and it proved the perfect choice. Browning gave \\"Dracula\\" the fog-shrouded look and feel of something evil and not of this world intruding upon the living. Something only wolfbane and a cross can keep at bay.<br /><br />It begins in Transylvania as Renfield (Dwight Frye) is on his way to Count Dracula's castle to have him sign lease papers. He is bewildered by the reaction of peasants when they discover his destination. But it is not long before Dracula (Bela Lugosi) has become his master and he discovers there are far worse things awaiting men than mere death.<br /><br />A chartered ship to England will become a crew of corpses with Renfield doing the bidding of his new master, and in the process slipping into insanity. It is in London that Dracula will meet the lovely Mina (Helen Chandler) and her friend Lucy (Frances Dade), whose fascination with the Count will lead her into a life of the undead.<br /><br />It is Mina Dracula has big plans for, however, only her love John Harker (David Manners) and the intrepid Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan) standing between he and the evil which could take Mina into darkness forever. Van Helsing knows that desperate measures must be taken or the two marks on Mina's neck will bring her forever under the spell of Count Dracula.<br /><br />Only a somewhat abrupt ending mars this film classic. Helen Chandler makes a lovely heroine and the atmosphere created by Tod Browning and cinematographer Karl Freund is made for late night viewing with a big bowl of popcorn. While it may be more fun today than horrific, as it was in 1931, it still stands as one of the great films in American cinema.fun today than horrific, as it was in 1931, it still stands as one of the great films in American cinema.

B000068QZK|4.0|Ozzy's first record with guitarist Zakk Wylde is, without a doubt, a marked improvement over the unashamedly \\"hair metal\\" sounding, utterly disappointing \\"The Ultimate Sin\\", released only 2 years prior to this. Indeed, after scaring the hell out of everybody by jumping into the (according to the definition of a dear friend of mine...)\\"filthy glam metal\\" bandwagon (and not only musically, but visually too...oh boy, those clothes, that hair...the horror, the horror...), Ozzy decided to go back to its trademark skull-bashing, bone crunching brand of rock, and he found in Zakk a great foil to achieve this. Completing his recording lineup at the time were drummer Randy Castillo (finally given free reign to pound on his drums like there's no tomorrow, and even to contribute to the songwriting), longtime collaborator Bob Daisley on bass and John Sinclair on keyboards. Contrary to popular belief, bassist Geezer Butler was not involved in the process, but rather joined the band for the subsequent tour.  Gone is the horrible, slick, smooth production of Ron Nevison. Legendary producer Roy Thomas Baker (known for his work with Queen) was originally tapped for the project, but after only a short time in the studio, he just couldn't see eye to eye with Ozzy on the direction of the album, and ultimately Keith Olsen stepped in.<br /><br />His first task was to \\"fix\\" the sound of the material already recorded, which to Ozzy lacked punch (especially on the drums), and then record some new, even punchier material. And he succeeded in both, creating an album that was closer to the wall of guitars approach of his first 2 solo albums. Some of the strongest cuts, placed in the first \\"half\\" of the album, were selected as singles: guitar heavy tracks \\"Breaking all the Rules\\" and \\"Crazy Babies\\" make little sense lyrically but are a great deal of fun; \\"Devil's Daughter\\" is another great tune that is fast and heavy and dumb, but great for headbanging and chockfull with great guitar; probably the weakest track is opener \\"Miracle Man\\", a direct attack to Jimmy Swaggart and other T.V evangelists who had often targeted Ozzy, making him the very definition of \\"evil\\" and using him as an scape goat, so it was only fitting that given such a brilliant opportunity, Ozz wouldn't pass up the chance to have a swing on him; but the resulting song, while quite explicit and effective lyrically, is fairly generic from the musical point of view.<br /><br />The same can be said about some of the material of the latter half of the album: \\"Bloodbath in Paradise\\" and \\"Tattooed Dancer\\" are fast and hard hitting, sure, but a little too topical and typical. That's not to say that they're bad, but they aren't the best tunes in here; \\"Demon Alcohol\\" is better simply because it deals with a topic that Ozzy knows all too well, and therefore rings true to the listener. \\"Fire in the Sky\\" slows down the pace somewhat, and while it's not one of my favorite tracks, I must admit that is has an interesting structure and it is an interesting, if somewhat odd, departure from the tried and true. Finally, \\"Hero\\" was a \\"hidden\\" bonus track that appeared on the 95 remaster, and it is quite a nice addition to the set and a great closing tune.<br /><br />This new 2002 remaster, however, graces us with 2 more cuts: \\"Liar\\" and a live version of \\"Miracle Man\\"; the latter has little interest, especially for those who have either the \\"Just Say Ozzy\\" and/or \\"Live and Loud\\" live sets, since the versions of that song included in those 2 releases are far better and have better sound, too. \\"Liar\\" is a real disappointment: the liner notes claim that it comes from the same recording sessions, but the sound is altogether different from the rest of the CD, which can be explained by one of two possibilities: it is either a demo, or one of the tracks from the \\"Roy Thomas Baker\\" sessions that wasn't remixed. It sounds tiny and lackluster in comparison with the rest of the material. And what the hell is the deal with that vocal melody, anyway? It keeps changing and changing and ultimately it never gets anywhere!! Its inclusion here is a mistake as it adds nothing to the original release, and it is justified purely as a marketing ploy to entice Ozzy fans into buying the album yet again.<br /><br />Not the most essential Ozzy release (my actual rating for it would be 3 1/2 stars, but since I can't put that...), but in the end a satisfying one that put the Madman back on track and more importantly, I believe, set the groundwork for the next record, \\"No More Tears\\", a true rock masterpiece. Think of it as a blueprint of sorts: all the elements that would make NMT a classic are here, although not fully realized. Some of its songs may not have aged as well, but if you enjoy(ed) \\"No More Tears\\" hard hitting, take no prisoners sound, you'll probably like this one as well.anyway?

B00004XSUW|5.0|It's hard to believe that 40 years have elapsed since Taj Mahal recorded his self-titled album. I can honestly say that Taj's debut album DID change my life because he opened the world of delta blues to me and transformed me from a suburban garage rocker into a fanatical avid collector of worn out 78 rpm of Mississippi blues recorded in the 1920s and 1930s. I learned most of my blues chops on guitar from listening to this album over and over.<br /><br />Technically this isn't Taj's first album but it's the first album that most music fans heard Taj Mahal on.  Both \\"Giant Step\\" and \\"De Ole Folks at Home\\" were released earlier and combined into a second release after the success of this self titled album.<br /><br />Taj's album led me to appreciate the significance of blues players like Robert Johnson, who was a forgotten and obscure figure in the world of popular music before Taj Mahal. It was the first time I ever heard anyone play an open tuned guitar in the blues bottleneck style.  I remember using a screwdriver and a newly purchased book of open tunings for guitar to imitate Jesse Davis' trademark southern fried guitar sound. A year later everyone from Duane Allman, Eric Clapton to Taj's own session player Ry Cooder had albums out playing bottleneck blues in the vintage style of Robert Johnson.<br /><br />Nobody, not even John Fahey or Paul Butterfield did more than Taj Mahal to expand the audience for authentic blues to a crossover audience of  suburban white kids who were living in the psychedelic renaissance of such great bands as the Doors, Cream and the Jimi Hendrix Experience when Taj's debut was released.<br /><br />Most extraordinary is the success of Taj Mahal's self titled album had a ripple effect on the careers of many obscure blues players who able to quit their day jobs and start gigging again, because of the reawakened interest in Mississippi blues.<br /><br />The late Walter \\"Furry\\" Lewis, a Memphis based blues guitarist once told me that Taj Mahal was responsible for his return to active gigging in the early Seventies. Furry with some help from fans managed to get put his battered Martin guitar out hock at a local pawn shop and Furry's second career began as he was pushing 80 years of age. Taj wasn't the only musician to bring the blues to a younger rock and roll audience but Taj was significant because he was one of the few younger black musicians who still played blues in 1967.<br /><br />The reason why you can still find an old Blind Willie Johnson or Charley Patton album still in issue at Amazon is because players like Fahey, Al Johnson, Paul Butterfield and Taj Mahal stubbornly refused to let the blues tradition wither away and die in the late Sixties and early Seventies.<br /><br />Taj specifically designed his first album appeal to a broader rock music audience without compromising the integrity of the vintage blues he was playing. He took blues out of the hands of the archivists and breathed life back into it with his charismatic performances.<br /><br />At the time of this album's release I saw the Taj Mahal Band perform a few times and it was a juggernaut of a band with a sledge-hammer drum and bass sound designed to appeal to rock music fans. Even as Taj experimented with his hybrid rock and blues fusion, he never strayed far from his authentic roots in Mississippi, Georgia and Texas country blues.<br /><br />For instance, a San Francisco hippie fan of Big Brother and the Holding Company or the Grateful Dead could readily appreciate the elements of both rock and roll and blues in Taj Mahal's music. As a result, Taj's music helped to open the doors of the both the Fillmore and Avalon to some of his elders B.B. King, Albert King and Muddy Waters.<br /><br />Part this album's appeal is Taj's magnificent full throated mastery of blues harmonica but equally important is guitarist Jesse Davis' blues drenched slide guitar and lead guitar playing. Jesse only stayed with the Taj Mahal band for two short years but the exuberance and the sheer joy of their collaboration can be heard on songs like \\"Leaving Trunk\\" and \\"Statesboro Blues.\\"  It's hard avoid the impulse to dance to these songs because the slow blues tempo is revved up to a mid-tempo shuffle.<br /><br />Kiowa native American guitar Jesse Davis was the glue that held the funky blues sound of the band together. Davis began his career playing the unlikely gig as country music star Conway Twitty's guitarist. Davis' versatility and mastery or roots music earned him a  reputation as a top gun Fender picking session guitarist. Following Davis' departure from the band Taj moved on to a sparse acoustic sound that had a wide sweep of influences as diverse as blues, ragtime, jazz country music, Brazilian, African music, reggae and other global folk music.<br /><br />Taj was never quite as electrifying on stage as he was with Jesse Davis at his side. After Davis' departure, Taj's solo live shows were a showcase of his own stylistic diversity and his virtuosity on a dozen musical instruments.  Both Taj and Jesse were college graduates with an academic interest in blues but when they hit the stage together, both Taj and Jesse played with the blackheart soul of the man who met up with the devil at the crossroads and signed on with Satan to play the blues. Unfortunately Jesse's demon was alcohol and the firewater finally consumed him in 1988.<br /><br />When all is said and done this early self-titled album by Taj Mahal will be the most significant of his long career. Taj didn't accept the conventional wisdom and stood up and demanded his music be listened to on it's own merits. Taj Mahal's debut album was a blast of fresh air in the psychedelic jungle that was popular music in 1968. 40 years later, this well worn relic of an album sounds more inspired and authentic than any the bling-bling jive by any rapper in the current jungle of hip hop music.Taj Mahal band for two short years but the exuberance and the sheer joy of their collaboration can be heard on songs like \\"Leaving Trunk\\" and \\"Statesboro Blues.\\"  It's hard avoid the impulse to dance to these songs because the slow blues tempo is revved up to a mid-tempo shuffle. <br /> <br />Kiowa native American guitar Jesse Davis was the glue that held the funky blues sound of the band together.

B00000IMTH|5.0|This, my friends, is without a doubt, my favorite Rainbow album and one of my top-ten records EVER! It was the first Rainbow album I got, and I picked it randomly after reading for sooooo many years about this great band where Dio and Blackmore teamed before Ronnie joined Sabbath. Being a MAJOR Dio-era Sabbath fan, I was intrigued, and finally I caved in. Of course, I had to order the damn thing because record stores in my country wouldn't carry anything but mainstream acts at the time. So without ever hearing a single note of the band's music, I ordered \\"Long Live Rock n' Roll\\". A few weeks later, after finally getting my hands on it and listening to it, I was speechless: IT IS SO AWESOME! Recorded in France at different times during 1977, the album features in addition to Ritchie Blackmore on guitars and Ronnie James Dio on vocals, the inimitable talents of Cozy Powell on drums. The lineup was completed by keyboardist Dave Stone and bassist Bob Daisley (who only played on a few songs) and while neither one has earned too much praise or many accolades for their contributions, the fact remains that without them the album wouldn't have been completed at all.<br /><br />The title track is simply great, you can definitely tell that Blackmore is the one playing, but it doesn't sound like Deep Purple at all, which was a big surprise for me, as I am also a big Purple fan. Dio is simply monstrous, and at the risk of having my life threatened by some diehards, I believe he sings even better than he would eventually do on \\"Heaven and Hell\\". It's heavy, yet catchy and melodic; \\"Lady of the lake\\" conjures up images of Knights, dungeons, dragons and magic that would become a Dio trademark and a primordial element of Euro-metal for decades to come (to this day, actually...) and rocks big time with some terrific slide guitar from Ritchie; \\"LA Connection\\" is another gem, slower than the previous tunes, but very intense and heavy; \\"Gates of Babylon\\" needs no further comment: simply put, a masterpiece, from the keyboard intro through its powerful lyrics to its awe inspiring guitar work.<br /><br />\\"Kill the King\\" is fast and furious, yet catchy and melodic, a true classic and one of my favorite songs ever. Unlikely as it might seem, I think that the studio version is even MORE potent than the live versions of the song that are available, a rare occurence when talking about this band, which was absolutely killer onstage. At this point I'm compelled to state the obvious: hearing this album and this song in particular you understand perfectly where Iron Maiden got their inspiration. Don't believe me? Well, just so you know, Steve Harris is a MAJOR Rainbow fan (he has said so on more than one occasion); \\"The Shed\\" builds up nice and slow and then it slams you in the face, driven by the power of the great, late Cozy Powell. \\"Sensitive to Light\\" is probably the only song that sounds a little out of place, sounding a little reminiscent to \\"If you don't like rock n' roll\\" from their debut album, but ultimately it's a great track too.<br /><br />And last but certainly not least, \\"Rainbow Eyes\\" is all subtlety, all fragility, all intensity and passion in one, without a doubt, the best Rainbow ballad (sorry Joe Lynn Turner freaks), built upon a beautiful guitar melody which is emphasized by a string and flute ensemble that is simply gorgeous.<br /><br />Too bad that this record would prove to be the last release from the Dio-era, as Blackmore would (once again!!!) change his mind about the musical direction he wanted for the band shortly after the completion of the supporting tour. While I might agree with most Rainbow diehards and scholars that \\"Rising\\" is probably their best album (it was in fact the last one I got from the Dio-era), this is the one that ultimately had the biggest impact on me and the one which will always hold the fondest musical memories for me. If you're new to Rainbow (Dio-era or otherwise), I suggest that you start your collectionwith either this or the debut album before digging into \\"Rising\\", which is far more complex and quite a bit harder to absorb at first. This should allow you to enter a comfort zone and gradually dig in deeper. This record is a masterpiece and no fan of 70's hard rock should do without it. Forgive me for the play on words, but it's too bad that this incarnation of the band didn't, in fact, \\"live long...\\"album before digging into \\"Rising\\", which is far more complex and quite a bit harder to absorb at first.

B000GGSMB2|5.0|Hard to believe it took me until now (February 2007) to finally see this excellent movie and witness the brutal language and the violent gun shootings that made Scarface so popular and award-deserving back in the early 80's. I loved this movie.  <br /> <br />It really delivers with the action and the characters are all interesting, especially Tony Montana. A movie that deserves to be as lengthy as it is (over 2 hours). Everyone must see Scarface at least once in their lifetime. It won't disappoint. The ending gave me goosebumps it was *that* good and intense. Watch it now.
B000002KDS|5.0|What did I do to deserve this? Alice Coopers fourth album, the raw and brash KILLERS serves up the best of the A.C. \\"shocker\\" songs in the A.C collection. Since I owned this album on vinyl for many years, I'll spin it down like this.. side two is more classic than side one (although side one still kicks, it's just not as -doomish- as side two, and doesn't satisfy the taste buds quite as much.)<br /><br />One is the Alice Cooper side. Opens with the radio friendly rocker UNDER MY WHEELS and BE MY LOVER. It decsends into the trippy HALO OF FLIES and then finishes off with the western-hitman classic DESPERADO...(nothing in common with that Eagles song of the same name...)<br /><br />Two is the KILLERS side, where the fun really begins. DRIVE ME NERVOUS, YEAH..., DEAD BABIES.. love that tune...blast it...it's like the Beatles on crack,...and the title track, a romper stomper for the ending.<br /><br />This album rocks in spades... arguably the best A.C. disc...check it out for sure!
B000002G26|5.0|Let the critics say what they want,Bryan Adams knows how to write a great hook filled song! This CD is one of the few in my vast collection that I give a perfect '5' star rating to and it earns every star<br /><br />I'm a metal head,I grew up on Dio,Motley Crue,Poison,Kiss etc.. so why am I raving about Bryan Adams? Because he's that good.<br /><br />If you look music of any kind from heavy to country to romantic ballads,any kind of music you will find something you can love in his music,it's timeless and his voice is never going to be considered the best of the best but that's okay because it fits this music perfectly,he sounds like the every day guy next door that lives and breathes these experiences<br /><br />The CD starts off with 'Summer Of '69' which is just about the ultimate driving song ever written (the only competition is Don Henley's 'Boys of summer),it is perfect and I'm sure makes just about everyone out there remember their own favorite summer,from there it goes to 'Straight From The Heart' a beautiful love song,from there is one of my personal favs,\\"It's Only Love\\" a duet with himself and Tina Turner,this song rocks,it really overflows with feeling and fun,from there the only song on the CD that I feel was overplayed 'Can't Stop This Thing We Started' it is a great song but the radio over played it (it's not Bryan's fault his songwriting is so good that radio over did it),then another beautiful love song 'Do I have To Say The Words' and this and every ballad has a different feel and emotion which is rare in this musical climate,after that is 'This Time' which is about as much fun you can have with a song and still be legal,then 'Run To You' which has atmosphere and such emotion in the lyrics that you just know he (or someone he knows) has lived through that experience...then my favorite Bryan Adams ballad 'HEaven' which they used to play at my middle school dances so it will live forever in a special place in my heart,and then 'Cuts Like A Knife' which was one of the very first videos I ever saw on MTV,they played it a lot but it never got old,great song and still sounds as fresh today as when it first came out,then 'Everything I do,I do it for you' another beautiful ballad with a beautiful message,personally I always think of Robin Hood the movie when I hear this song (the arrow going into the tree is a visual that will forever go with this song),another great fun rocking song follows 'Somebody' and then right into 'Kids Wanna Rock' it's almost impossible to not smile when you hear these songs,and it's followed with a true gem 'Heat Of The Night' which is the absolute perfect atmosphere song (right alongside 'Def Leppard's \\"foolin\\")...my only criticism of this perfect CD is why would they choose to end such a fun CD with a ballad...'Please Forgive Me' is a beautiful song but should have been in the middle,they should have ended it with 'Heat Of The Night' let it end on a rocking note..but that aside this is what rock and roll and songwriting in general should be....it should be noted that Bryan has released a few other greatest hits packages over the years but don't be fooled this is the best of the best,his next attempt 'The Best Of Me' is very weighted down with ballads and almost ignores his rocking side...this is a perfectly balanced CD that will appeal to any fan of fun rock and roll<br /><br />The Upside - This is how to write songs...Bryan is an expert...and it is also proof of why producers are so important to an artist,Mutt Lange is a genius (as his track record proves) the songs sound perfect,warm and yet crisp..there are no show off moments,just great singing and musicians that above all highlight the songwriting,what can I say other then perfection<br /><br />The Downside - There is none<br /><br />The Bottom Line - If you are a songwriter,or want to be,buy this CD to learn how it should be done...This CD is everything that is missing in almost all modern music and it can be summed up in one 3 letter word - FUN! This CD is fun ....run out to buy this,especially at this price,donutman says so!!!3 letter word - FUN! This CD is fun ....run out to buy this,especially at this price,donutman says so!!!

Not quite sure what the reasoning was here. All the songs on their own are fantastic but packaged together side by side it's just too much of one style.<br /><br />'The Best Of Me' - ballad<br /><br />'Can't Stop This Thing We Started' - extremely overplayed but good song<br /><br />'I'm Ready' - painfully slow ballad<br /><br />'Summer Of '69' - absolute perfection in songwriting,his best song ever!<br /><br />'Let's Make A Night To Remember' - ballad but my favorite song on this CD<br /><br />'All For Love' - (ballad)I would have bet this was Michael Bolton with  friends<br /><br />'Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman - yet another ballad,nice one though<br /><br />'Run To You'  - great rocking song,I love this one<br /><br />'Cloud Number Nine' - pretty good song<br /><br />'Everything I do ' - ummm another ballad<br /><br />'Back To You - a pretty good song<br /><br />'When You're Gone '- A nice duet with ex spice girl mel c<br /><br />'Please Forgive Me' and yet another ballad<br /><br />'The Only Thing That Looks Good On Me Is You - Great rocking tune<br /><br />'Inside Out' - are you kidding me,end  with yet one more ballad<br /><br />I would recommend buying this if you are a fan or simply enjoy most of these songs and want to listen to them one at a time....but seriously run out and buy 'So Far So Good' that is MUCH MUCH Better...Bryan Adams is great and has a romantic soft side but also has a rocking side that you would just never know from this release<br /><br />The Upside - packed full of great,well thought out songs,great production and great singing and performances,plus includes some gems that were not included on the previous greatest hits package<br /><br />The Downside - (snooring) It literally puts me to sleep,never listen to this while driving a vehicle,far too many slow songs on one CD<br /><br />The Bottom Line - As a huge Bryan Adams fan I had to buy this because I love every song,I just wish he would have either released a double album with more upbeat songs or left off some of these ballads...you should check this out because the songs really are good but definitely buy 'So Far So Good' from Bryan Adams first to really get a taste of what this songwriting genius is capable of....or if you have insomnia and need some helping getting to sleep this is a perfect prescription...donutman says so!!!elease <br /> <br />The Upside - packed full of great,well thought out songs,great production and great singing and performances,plus includes some gems that were not included on the previous greatest hits package <br /> <br />The Downside - (snooring) It literally puts me to sleep,never listen to this while driving a vehicle,far too many slow songs on one CD <br /> <br />The Bottom Line - As a huge Bryan Adams fan I had to buy this because I love every song,I just wish he would have either released a double album with more upbeat songs or left off some of these ballads...you should check this out because the songs really are good but definitely buy 'So Far So Good' from Bryan Adams first to really get a taste of what this songwriting genius is capable of....or if you have insomnia and need some helping getting to sleep this is a perfect prescription...donutman says so!!!

0553381407|5.0|If I could give this book 10 stars, I would.  I have suffered for years in the revolving door of insanity trying to put a finger on what was  happening in my life.  I went through therapy sessions, and in and out of various religions hoping to find peace.  This book has done more for me overnight then what all those years of searching could not, and that was to recognize the orgin of my suffering. <br /> <br />Ms. Forward's book came to me after a recurrence of breast cancer.  I was devistated.  I ate right, exercised and did all of the right stuff or so I thought.  Yet, here I was getting this disease again.  I was at a standstill as to what to do.   <br /> <br />After reading her book and comparing my life with her case studies, I walked away in awe as to all of the layers of garbage that I had been pushing down my gullet, all to protect my parents and the family structure, when in fact, I was the victim. <br /> <br />She is bold enough to talk about the religious influences from Biblical text such as \\"honor thy mother and father...\\" that scriptually may   parents abusing their children. <br /> <br />Ms. Forward book has allowed me to see my destructive patterns of behavior and give me the tools to change these areas. Also, it has allowed me to identify dysfunctional behavior in others.  This is particularily helpful for those of us who are single and still looking for a mate.  <br /> <br />I have given this book to 11 people who I recognized were suffering as I had been. I believe that this is the kind of book that should be given to couples who are interested in premaritial counseling, chemical dependency and alcohol abuse couselors, guidance counselors and the list goes on.

0375408266|3.0|When he is fifteen years old, Michael, a German boy, has an affair with an older woman.  He is not of the generation that had to deal with World War II--that was the generation of his parents and of this love affair of his, Hanna.  Their love affair is short-lived, though.  Hanna is sometimes mysterious and sometimes moody, and one day she is simply gone from town and gone from Michael's life.  He is deeply affected by her disappearance but continues on with his life and eventually ends up in law school. <br /> <br />While in law school, Michael comes across Hanna again.  He goes to watch a trial of five women, accused of being guards at a concentration camp near Auschwitz and of causing the deaths of hundreds of concentration camp victims.  Hanna is one of the accused, and she is actually the one accused of being the mastermind and therefore the most guilty woman among the bunch.  She seems not to know how to defend herself, and Michael gradually comes to realize why.  His dilemma is then whether to do something about it or to keep Hanna's secret to himself. <br /> <br />The idea that someone could almost accidentally become a Nazi is both fascinating and horrifying.  I was interested in reading about someone who has a personal secret she finds so absolutely shameful and unmentionable that she would be willing to do truly appalling things in order to keep it hidden. <br /> <br />The characters in this book, though, are unsympathetic, and I thought the ending was lousy.

0060853980|5.0|I love this book!  The first time I came across it, it was hidden in a corner in a bookstore.  It cried out to me.  I had to take it home.  I laughed so hard that I cried, more than once.  I loved it so much I gave it away.  Which is an extraordinarily difficult thing for me to do.  But it wanted to be shared, and I can't deny a book its destiny.  My brain, however, is not so capable of release.  I had to buy it again.  And read it over and over and over.  Until I gave it to my boyfriend, before we were dating.  And still, I read it at his house.  When he forgot and gave it back to me, I cruelly didn't correct him.  (It came back to me!  It must be fate!)  Now, there's a new edition out, with comments by the authors.  I have to go get it.<br /><br />I'm obsessed.  It's unhealthy.  I know.  Come join me.  It's the best apocalypse you'll ever survive.<br /><br />Crowley and Aziraphale have been locked in the battle between good and evil since, well, at least the beginning of time.  In fact, it's been so long that it's become more of a debate then a battle.  Actually more of a conversation.  Aziraphale is an angel, and part-time rare bookseller.  It's a front; he really collects the books for himself.  Crowley is sort of a fallen angel; well, as the book says \\"an angel who did not so much fall as saunter vaguely downward\\".  So he's a demon, ish.  Mostly he's an instigator.  These two have been enemies for so long that they've become pretty good friends.<br /><br />But that's all going to end.  Everything is going to end.  Next Saturday.  That's when the apocalypse has been scheduled for.  The final battle between good and evil.  What's an angel, or demon, to do when it comes time to end the world, but they really don't want to?<br /><br />The apocalypse is aided and thwarted, alternately, by angels, demons, and an assortment of other ridiculous, hilarious, pitiful characters.

B0000033TE|5.0|Just about anyone who is a fan of classic progressive rock probably already owns this album.  It is considered one of the all time classics of the genre and from a commercial standpoint was ELP's high water mark.  The single from the album \\"Karn Evil 9 1st Impression Part 2\\" (can you imagine a single with that title today?), with it's famous opening line \\"Welcome Back My Friends To The Show That Never Ends\\" is still played in sports stadiums and on highlight reels throughout the world to this day.  Some fans say this is the band's best work, some don't.  For critics this album contained everything that they hated about prog rock.  Bombast, pomp, epics, long instrumental excursions, and sci fi lyrics, it's all here.  The album starts out with a cover of the British classic hymn \\"Jerusalem\\".  This is followed by \\"Toccata\\" which is an adaptation of Ginastera's 1st Piano Concerto, 4th Movement.  The highlight of this piece is Carl Palmer's use of what was then pioneering percussion synthesizers.  At the time no one else was doing anything like this.  Greg Lake's \\"Still You Turn Me On\\" is next, serving as a very cool little ballad as only Lake can sing them.  \\"Benny The Bouncer\\" is a throwaway track with honky tonk piano.  Then the band get out the big guns for the almost 30 minute \\"Karn Evil 9\\" that tells the story of the battle of man vs. machine.  This is ELP at their best with the incredible keys work of Keith Emerson, the frenetic percussion of Carl Palmer, and the churning bass and vocals of Greg Lake.  Lake even throws in a rare electric guitar solo.  Listing to this today it all sounds a bit dated, but at the time this was ground breaking stuff.  If you ask ELP fans it is usually a tossup between \\"Karn Evil 9\\" and \\"Tarkus\\" as to which is the band's masterwork.  If you are not familiar with ELP and are looking to explore them this would be a good place to start.

0307277887|5.0|I bought this book thinking that it would be similar to the wonderful plot observed on the TV series.  <br />The main difference between the novel and the series is that the series has a different engaging homicide killer each episode.

0465043577|5.0|Occasionally I come across a book, article, or other publication that makes me think \\"I wish I'd read this when I first started trading\\".  The (Mis)behavior of Markets is a good example of this kind of book, although I suspect that if it did exist when I started trading I would not have properly understood the implications of what Mandelbrot was saying.<br /><br />Now I do understand, and it was a confirmation of some of the conclusions I had already come to by trial, error, losing money, and a lot of research and deep thinking.  Reading this book has helped me formulate my own \\"Stochastic Price Change Model\\" which will be the subject of a future eBook or article and has helped me reach a different perspective on how to more effectively test the robustness of trading methods.<br /><br />You may have heard of Mandelbrot from his work on fractals, and in this book he applies that mathematical model to explain exactly why all the existing financial models (the Black Scholes Option Pricing and the Capital Asset Pricing Model to name but two) are not as useful as they are touted to be, or just plain dangerous.<br /><br />\\"Prices are normally distributed\\", \\"fat tails are simply anomalies\\", \\"prices are independent of each other\\".  These are all fundamental assumptions of the mainstream models of the market and of risk taking.  Mandelbrot challenges all these assumptions and presents a more useful (or at least accurate) fractal view of markets which may change your perception on how much risk you are really taking and how likely \\"unprecedented\\" events may actually be.<br /><br />I immediately put this book on my trading \\"must read\\" list.  The implications of what it discusses will continue to be influential in my own trading and my trading beliefs in the future.  Read it with an open mind and see what happens.

B00003CXXJ|4.0|Shrek (Mike Myers) is an ugly green ogre who only likes life when he is alone.  Naturally, he's rather upset when his swamp is invaded by all kinds of magical creatures.  Seems that Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) is trying to create the perfect kingdom.  And everyone knows that you can't have a perfect kingdom with magical creatures around.<br /><br />But Shrek is not going to take this lightly.  Setting out with a talking Donkey (Eddie Murphy), he goes to meet Lord Farquaad to demand his swamp back.<br /><br />But Farquaad has other ideas.  He's looking for someone to go on a quest for him.  The mission, to rescue Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from a fire breathing dragon.  So he makes a deal with Shrek - rescue the girl, and he can have his swamp back.<br /><br />Naturally, Shrek agrees to the deal.  But Fiona is not at all what Shrek thought she'd be like.  And she has a secret.  All this makes the perfect fractured fairytale.<br /><br />This computer animated movie is a riot.  It takes many fairytale conventions and turns them on their ear.  There are also lots of great small gags, usually at the expense of a classic story.  And Disney.  Katzenberg obviously feels the need to get back at his ex-employer.  But, Disney fanatic that I am, I must admit some of those jokes are my favorites.  Along the way, the movie develops a great heart as well and subtly slips in a message about loving people for who they are.  The animation, while a bit rough on the \\"extras\\" is wonderful on the main characters.<br /><br />The only problem with the movie, and it's a big one, is the crude humor.  Shrek's on ogre.  We get it.  Fortunately, these jokes lessen as the movie progresses.  There are a few jokes that are questionable for young children as well.<br /><br />Of course, most of them probably won't get many of the jokes anyway.  This is a fairytale for adults.  And a fun one at that.

B00004S35Z|5.0|This is one of Stevie's best albums. I absolutely love it!
B000J10ERO|5.0|I absolutely love this movie!  I have always loved the superman movies, but this renewed my appreciation for them.  I thought it was true to the Christopher Reeve version, just a little updated and with the exception that Kate Bosworth's \\"Lois Lane\\" is portrayed as more of a serious character vs. Margot Kidder's upbeat version.  But that is only circumstantial by the plot. Brandon Routh does a fantastic job in the roll of \\"Superman\\" and I think it is completely uncanny how he has captured so many of Reeve's expressions and mannerisms.  He is a truely gifted actor and I hope to see a lot more out of him.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|Item as described and received in a timely manner... an excellent buying experience!
B000LC55F2|5.0|\\"The Prestige\\", in my opinion, is one of the best movies of 2006!  It has a very intricate plot line, in which it is, virtually impossible to understand by only seeing it one time.  I saw it four times in the theater and it is truly amazing.  Definitely some of Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale's best work thus far.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Must see by young and old alike.  This account will help you get a better perspective on the impact we all are having on the planet.  Al Gore does a great job of synthesizing tons of data into a compelling presentation that should leave you scratching your head, wondering, why have we doubted the science for so long. <br /> <br />If you have lingering questions, strongly suggest you see this movie.  If you don't have questions, I think this account is still valuable to see so that you have a broader understanding.
0783228457|4.0|I own Scanners, Dead Zone, Videodrome, and The Fly.  Overall, I like these movies, but they all have one thing in common for sure, and that is they all start out good and have a good idea, but by the end of the movie, you are like, \\"What was that?\\" or \\"Why didn't they go this way with the film?\\"  For example, \\"Scanners\\", the guy had the ability to do what he could do, but didn't use it convincingly or very well.  I felt Ironside in that movie should have been the good guy, not the bad guy, which he played very well I might add.  The last scene where him and his brother have a scan off, his transformation was very intense.  It could have been used as his comeback on a bad guy, the ultimate Michael Ironside Scan.  And with \\"Videodrome\\", how cutting edge and creepy it was until he started having the hallucinations(?), then it got way too out of control and over the top, which I've come to expect from a Cronenberg film.  But it would have been even better had they kept the over-the-top sci-fi stuff out and made it about the cable company broadcasting such trashy stuff and maybe finding out it was real death they were watching.  That could have been the mystery.  Finding out where this was going on.  They should have stuck with the whole \\"snuff\\" t.v./ S&M stuff.      I watched Videodrome last night and was really really into it, until he lost his gun in his stomach, the gun grew into his hand sometimes, and sometimes it wasn't.  If you buy this, don't get Criterion version, you might be disappointed.  But this release for like 8 or 10 bucks is well worth it, especially for Cronenberg fans. I do believe I'm done buying Cronenberg for now though.  I might get \\"Naked Lunch\\" or \\"Dead Ringers\\".  David Lynch movies will be my next project.     My favorite Cronenberg, in order is...Haven't seen any others....    1. The Dead Zone  2. Videodrome  3. Scanners  4. The Fly
B000I5X81A|3.0|This CD suffers from a tiredness which seeps through the music.  On the positive side, Clapton gets in a few interesting guitar licks here and there, and one or two songs might get your toes tapping.  In general, however,  the selection of songs lean toward the easy and familiar,  and the commercial. The selections are a slapdash mix of musical styles  which don't really complement each other.  The recording quality is mediocre.  One of the songs is named, \\"Hard to Thrill\\".  It is about a man who has seen it all and is bored by life.  That's how this album sounds....a general listlessness and boredom with life permeates throughout, and there is nothing new or exciting here.  Disappointing.
B000KCHZK6|4.0|Listening to this cd can make you realize that many of the songs have a similar sound to them.  Actually if you aren't paying close enough attention you could get through the cd without really hearing the songs.  It's unfortunate that Norah who has such a beautiful voice doesn't seem to be producing songs that can attract new fans.  What is even more unfortunate is that Norah seems to be loosing her base audience.  I was not overly impressed with any one song in this collection.  It's nice but nothing will make a top 40 list.  This cd is generally good to listen to when you are taking a relaxing trip or just using it for background sound.  I will continue to enjoy this cd and hope that Norah is willing to take more chances.  She is young enough that she should be targeting a new audience.  The audience that she captured in her first cd is not going to hang around long.
B000LC3ID8|3.0|Smashing extremities. Twisting, compound bone fractures. Bodies completely ripped apart. Bodies blown to pieces. Heads shot off. Acid baths. Skin freezing. A drowning pool of decay. Brain surgery. Good old fashion throat slashing.<br /><br />Sound like fun? Then...it's your future...I see Saw III in your Amazon cart!<br /><br />By now the Saw story--whether it's the original, the second or third--should be familiar enough: Jigsaw wants you to appreciate life more. So to get you to do so, he tests you. He wants to play a game....Get through the booby trap infested film and live. Fail, then die. Make your choice.<br /><br />Saw III wraps up some Saw I and Saw II loose ends while seemingly taking us through the perils of Jigsaw's final test subject....Or should I say subjects? And is this the final Saw? Not bloody likely.<br /><br />The first ingredient for a good sequel is when the same writers and directors that did the original return. And they did that in spades for Saw III.<br /><br />Leigh Whannell co-wrote and appeared (as Adam) in all 3. James Wan directed and co-wrote 1, co-produced 2, and co-wrote and produced 3. Darren Lynn Bousman co-wrote and directed 2 and 3. You get the point...all the main creators are still hanging in there.  So \\"check\\" for the first ingredient.<br /><br />The second key ingredient is getting all of the key actors back. Check again.<br /><br />Another key ingredient is getting the sequels out relatively close; since 2004 the Saw films have been released in consecutive years. Checkaroo.<br /><br />As for another sequel??? Saw IV is scheduled for this year to keep that consistency going, but Wan and Whannell seem to be the only main guys attaching their names to IV as of today. David Hackl who did some secondary work on 2 & 3 is rumored to be the director.<br /><br />Plus with some key characters seemingly out for any more sequels, the Saw franchise after III looks to perhaps be headed down Friday the 13th Sequel Overkill Road.<br /><br />Regardless, the first three in the series are good...for the genre. But, oh so much torture and gore! Especially in Saw III. Still sane after witnessing all the carnage in just Saw III? Imagine the mind warping of watching all 3 in one weekend. Might want to keep your distance from me...er, uh, I mean...anyone that calls that a fun 6 hours.so much torture and gore! Especially in Saw III.

B000AADYRQ|4.0|I have become more and more familiar with Death Cab over the last few months with their successful song \\"I will follow you into the dark\\".  The song has such a good sound to it that it was natural for me to invest in their cd.  After playing the cd a couple of times I began to realize that most of their songs in this collection are good but not great.  Death Cab has a consistent sound to their music.  It's smooth and poetic.  That is what really sets this cd forth into a very good complimation.  Except if you are like me and are buying this cd mainly because of I will follow you don't expect any of the other songs to be on that caliber.  Generally if you are looking for a decent cd with a smooth tone this is a good addition to any collection.
B000FVQM2Y|2.0|This film is more of an exercise in the medium of film (playing with editing and genre stereotypes) than an exercise in storytelling with any relatability or character development. It's set around a present day high school but has very little relevence to contemporary teen culture. I assume the film's not meant to be realistic, but even taken as a stylised reality it seems to lack a foundation of consistent governing principles. This is the worst kind of film, not blatantly insulting to your intelligence but just a chore to understand without any reward for your effort.
B000IOM1RI|5.0|This is an awesome CD. I cannot stop listening to it. I have not seen the movie but enjoy the music, full of humour and great guitar and vocals.
B00000G3PA|5.0|Thank you so much for the quick mailing of this movie. Excellent service and I will purchase items through them aagain.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This is the best Jane Eyre I've watched. Very well done. Mr. Rochester is not so severe in his demeanor in this movie. As he begins to know Jane, he is taken with her. Soon a marriage proposal happens. For the first time in Jane's life, she feels accepted by someone. She finds hope in herself after being an outcast from her family. During the wedding ceremony, Jane hears heartbreaking news. I love the ending for this movie. It truly is happy. <br />This is a movie that you can laugh and cry over. I highly recommend seeing this.
B0000024JN|5.0|this is the best rap album of all time. no one comes close. this will never be beat.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|This is a beautiful and captivating performance. The women remind me of angels with beautiful white dresses and clear, sweet voices. The setting at the castle is the perfect backdrop. They have everything. The choir is fantastic and the drummers are awesome. My favorite woman is Chloe. She has this innocence about her when she sings. Her voice is so rich and pure. Since I play the fiddle, Mairead is a favorite with me. She is amazing! I have tried playing while dancing and running around. Harder said than done. It still amazes me that she can dance, play the fiddle, and still sound good! I highly recommend this DVD and CD.
B000M06K5C|5.0|Silent Alarm was a  terrific album but Weekend in the City just seems like a mature step forward. They took their sound in a new direction and it is great. Weekend in the City shows that Bloc Party is going to be an amazing band for a long time.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Simply put, the values extolled by this film are classic yet timely in this world of ours.  While it demonstrated the value of competitiveness it knew where to draw the line (at the finish line no less!) showing that kindness and respect triumph over the win at all costs attitudes.  Engaging by it's story line, phenomenal characters and scenery, it is sure to become an ageless fan favorite for years to come.
B000IOMXRQ|3.0|It is so annoying when record companies re-release cds with bonus material and/or dvd. It is just a sneaky way to get more money. I already own the cd and the Vinyl LP record edition of this album (That was a gift). I shouldn't have to buy the same album twice. Now, If I didn't already own this album, then this version would be worth the purchase. The music alone deserves a 5 star rating. What the record companies need to do with this bonus material is release it with the first release, save it for the next album, or release it by itself at a lower cost.
0739326651|5.0|This book is much more than a political opinion.  It is a history lesson, a constitution lesson, a tour of how the senate operates, a simple review of US foreign policy from the beginning.  It also contains a thoughtful chapter on how and why politicians can be changed by political forces once they are in office. If you want to know what Obama thinks about the issues, read this.  If your knowledge of US history, the Constitution, US foreign policy, or the history of our attitude toward war is a bit fuzzy, read this.  The title is explanatory: Obama's thoughts on our country and our hopes for our country. Even if you didn't vote for this man, you owe it to yourself to read his book.  It will help you to better listen and evaluate the issues.  And the man can write!
B000M4RG42|4.0|I think the above quote, taken from the excellent-yet-disjointed Flags of Our Fathers, is important for two reasons.  First, it accurately encapsulates a lot of what the film tries to convey.  And second, even though I watched the movie twice, I still have no idea who said it.<br /><br />This latter point either illustrates how convolutedly this movie jumps around or it's just an example of how stupid I am (but I prefer to think it is the former reason).  I believe the line emanates from an older Joe Rosenthal, the photographer who took the famous photo that is the centerpiece for this mostly-compelling drama.  However, in the interest of full disclosure (and also of not being too spoilery), I must admit I don't know for sure.<br /><br />And ultimately, it doesn't really matter.  Because the most important thing to note is that while I was confused at times, I still found \\"Flags\\" to be a tremendously strong and moving film.  And from me, that's saying quite a lot, because I usually dislike war movies.<br /><br />Actually, I think I liked this movie mostly because it's not a conventional \\"war movie\\" per se (those who are looking for another Saving Private Ryan will, I think, be disappointed).  Rather, this film (along with its cinematic sister, Letters From Iwo Jima, which I just saw), is in fact a study of perception and perspective, of how \\"truth\\" can be framed and altered (much like a photo) depending upon who is doing the telling.<br /><br />I believe the biggest challenges or limits inherent in most war films is that we frequently have a tendency to emotionally invest ourselves in whomever we see on screen the most.  And oftentimes, there is too much of a simplistic \\"good vs. evil\\" style of storytelling. But in this movie (as well as in \\"Letters\\"), director Clint Eastwood doesn't merely paint with a broad brush of black and white but instead colors his canvas with the more grayish tones of which our world seems to consist.<br /><br />My only gripes with the film (consistent with other reviewers here) are that it jumps around too much (and I usually am an advocate of non-linear cinema) and that we don't get much of a sense of the soldiers' home lives or back stories, even upon their return.  Maybe this was a deliberate maneuver on Clint's part - either to limit the length of an already-long (two hour and twelve minute) film or to temper our usually one-sided investment in the characters.<br /><br />That said, the performances are all solid, with the standout being Adam Beach as the ultra-reluctant \\"hero\\" Ira Hayes (\\"All I did was try not to get shot,\\" he laments in one heart-wrenching scene).<br /><br />This movie is very good on its own, and even better in conjunction with Letters From Iwo Jima.  Like others, I am amazed at how limited this DVD is (not even a chapter menu!), so I would wait to buy the inevitable super-special combo pack of the two films when it arrives.s with the film (consistent with other reviewers here) are that it jumps around too much (and I usually am an advocate of non-linear cinema) and that we don't get much of a sense of the soldiers' home lives or back stories, even upon their return.

B00009ATIX|3.0|This dumming down of Tarkovsky's original,'Solaris' is a peculiar form of hommage. I doubt I'd rate it any higher even if its predecessor didn't exist. If this effort earns a 3, Tarkovsky's would be off the map: literally circumnavigating the earth. Tarkovsky is on record about not being happy with his film and the difficulties he had working with the actors. But they are far more subtle, internalised performances than we have here with the Sondabergh. Neither film pays overdue attention to the details of Lem's novel. That's not an issue with film anyway. But if you've seen Tarkovsky's work, for all its tedious arguments and sense of timelessness, you are beholding something you will never forget. If ever one of his films exemplified the title of his collected writings,'Sculpting With Time', it's this one. It is majestic. Not in a panoramic sense but in the psychological: teasing out Lem's themes of love and projection. We simply don't get a grip from the lead actors, even Clooney, of forces worming out of their own consciences. That's partly the star system working against itself. Clooney is, well, Clooney; another day at the office. And you can't forget it. His 'ex' has seductive star glamour, but the voice is frigid. The script spells things out in bold type and there is little room for our participatory involement. Kiddies, if you missed the point, Welsh bard, Dylan Thomas's, Death Hath No Dominion' will help legibility.The original is a cathartic experience! Seven Samurai and the Magnificent Seven have parallel power: devolvement and diminishment don't threaten the derived version. You won't find the comparison carries here.
0525948023|5.0|I am a big fan of the work of Echart Tolle, and this book has not changed that a bit. I am, however, a bit puzzled with the opening sentence in his book; \\"Earth, 114 million years ago, one morning just after sunrise: The first flower ever to appear on the planet opens up to receive the rays of the sun.\\" From what I have learned about the evolution of life on our planet, flowers came a lot earlier than 114 million years ago? Is the opening sentence a result of poor research, or is it a joke I didn't get? <br /> <br />Anyway, this is probably totally beside the point of the book, which is to help you be more present in your own life as it happens right now. And this is important no matter when the first flower opened its petals on this planet.
0393327655|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I have always felt that religion is a man-made tool to keep all the sheep in line.  \\"Opiate of the masses\\" ring any bells???  To NOT believe in a higher power or a creator in this life, makes one into a true minority.  Most Americans have vehemently expressed the notion that they would NEVER vote for an atheist, and to me this sorta says it all.  It's sad that exercising common sense, or feeling that a God-free world is just as beautiful (or even more so) as one that pays tribute to a higher power, has become such a stigma.  In a phrase \\"god forbid free thinkers.\\"  So it was nice to read a very rational look at the world through a lens of clarity unblemished by dogmatic brainwashing.  Religion has been tearing our world apart for centuries, and it's time we moved on if we want to have any chance at reaching the next stage in mental evolution.  That is the ultimate point of this book.   <br /> <br />This subject matter could fill thousands of pages, so I'm not going to criticize the areas that the author chose.  I for one was impressed by his courage to dive into consciousness as well as ethics.  Certainly there are more specified texts out there, but all-in-all, I think this is a very good primer on religion and the negative impacts it can have on the world (and is having), and generally, he covers more ground than in any of the other books I have read. <br /> <br />As far as atheistic ethics are concerned, check out the works of Bob Wright's \\"The Moral Animal\\" and \\"NonZero Sum\\".  Both of those go into great detail about how being \\"moral\\" does not have to be tied to religion in any way.  In fact, some of the most loving and moral people I have ever known are atheists or agnostics.  Thankfully, some of us can find reasons for kindness outside of scripture. <br /> <br />So the only response I have to \\"end of faith\\" would be an eager \\"yes please....when?\\"  Sadly I doubt I'll ever see much progress in my lifetime.  Most people would haveno reason to go on if they suddenly had to open their eyes to the fantasy they were sold.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0393061434|5.0|This book is a true reflection of a brilliant engineer.  Woz debunked lots of Apple-related misconceptions regarding his \\"departure\\" from Apple.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|I'm 37; I was raised on the Beatles (among many, many other artists) thanks to MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR and the \\"Red\\" and \\"Blue\\" compilations in my Mom's music library. As a teen, I somehow rediscovered the Fab Four on my own and purchased every cassette, album, book and magazine article I could get my hands on, as well as lots of movies, Paul/Wings and George and John and Ringo albums, and I was 17 when the \\"canonical\\" recordings were released on CD...I bought all of them, as well, and have purchased most product released since then, with the exceptions of the ANTHOLOGY and LIVE AT THE BBC discs. All I'm saying is that, in my opinion, I've become somewhat of a Beatles connoisseur over the years, in my opinion. <br /> <br />I did not purchase this one right away (I simply can not stand the Cirque du Soleil, sorry), but after reading a fairly objective and descriptive review in the local paper, I eventually just had to hear this one for myself. <br /> <br />I am amazed, thrilled, and so, so happy this album was made; what a wonderful listening experience I'm having! I feel that the \\"snippets\\" fit perfectly (in regards to tempo AND key) where the Martins chose to put them on this collection. It is really so very respectful, and yet experimental and bold...I won't describe individual cuts or songs, but as a lifelong Beatle fan, again: I am so happy this has been done; I AM IN LOVE WITH THE LOVE ALBUM. After just a week, I'm still listening in sheer awe.
B00000I0XW|5.0|Excellent Broadway music--a true master. Sing along or just listen. First heard her on PBS.
B000H30B2C|5.0|I rented his movie to see the CG effects, which looked awesome in the early trailers. I expected little from the plot. What a pleasant surprise! Director Jackson found a way to add layers of detail and subtlety to an implausible story. By putting together a stellar team of creatives, and actors, Jackson has turned a \\"B pic\\" cult movie into a \\"A class\\" film. <br />Making a story about a giant gorilla is certainly dicey. Turning that gorilla into a sympathetic character is a seemingly impossible task. Jackson carefully crafted a story line depicting a lonely giant that has a gentle side. Part of this gentle side is love of beauty. Whether it is Naomi Watts character, or a beautiful sunset. This drive turns the monster into a sympathetic character.  <br />Special attention should be given to the direction of the story boarding. Few films have demonstrated such frame by frame compositional perfection. <br />Then there is the look of the film, which carefully recreates the depression era. Exceptional scene lighting sets the mood together with a subtle music score. <br />Finally there is the actors. Naomi Watts is exceptional as the lead Ann Darrow, both in look and acting ability. This is, without a doubt, the most important casting choice of the movie. To pull off the emotional impact of the story, it is critical that the relationship between Kong and Ann Darrow work. Watts hit a home run. The other part of this unusual(?) relationship was brilliantly achieved, via the efforts of Andy Serkis. Serkis acted out the role of Kong, just as he did Golem in Lord of the Rings.  <br />The rest of the cast is similarly effective both in looking the part and in acting ability.  <br />This kind of depth of talent on both the acting side, and the creative, is rare. Fortunately the powers that be, in Hollywood (those who make the money decisions), have been willing to invest in such large talent pools. I am going to use another sports analogy: Enough money will buy you a football team. If however, you want to win a superbowl, you need a special group of individuals. You need people, who are willing to do more then just put in a performance. You need people willing to pull out all the stops. This group did just that, and in doing so, created a genre masterpiece.
1400064287|5.0|All the glowing reviews for this book weren't wrong.  I received this book from Amazon only a couple of days ago and have already finished it.  I never thought that a business book could be such a page-turner!  I loved it so much that I've ordered copies for all my friends in the teaching business.  This book is a MUST READ for anyone that's looking for ways to inspire students and to craft ideas in ways that are meaningful and memorable.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|The definitive documentary of WWII's European theater. The inclusion of interviews with victims, participants and observers adds much to the excellent footage covering primarily the war in Europe, Africa, and Asia.
B000MNP2KI|1.0|I am truly sorry for being a (as some call us ) a \\"NAYSAYER\\" but I actually went to see the movie an I regretted it. <br /> The Script is inconsistent,silly,has nothing to do with the original novel(if you want to know how 007 and the secret service deals with rogue agents,traitors an so on.....read Octopussy !). <br />The actor are consistently bad lighted,bad dressed and are given a dreadful dialogue to work with. <br /> Daniel Craig looks more like a enemy side hitman,he is too beefed up has his chest shaved (!!!)he could be christened  Dirty Jimmy. <br /> i think I am going to cahnge my e-Mail address
B000E1MTYU|4.0|This title looks good for its 1080i picture. I have a 1080p capable Sony TV with a Blu-Ray player that is hooked up identically as the HD yet all HD titles are 1080i and the Blu-Ray 1080p. Regardless this movie looks good and sounds great. HD is a good fit for a big budget \\"blockbuster\\" like this.
B00005JP9V|1.0|In reading some of the reviews here, I think I might have seen a different film! The one I saw had only slight resemblence to the book but, even a that, a knowledge of the book was essential if one was to have any idea of what was going on. A sudden pregnancy is the deus ex machina which will save mankind from extincition but, if the characters in this movie are any indication, I would wonder why we would want to bother.  <br /> <br />The greatest mystery of all is how great actors such as Michae Caine and Juliana Moore could be enticed to appear it this dreary (in many respects) movie.  <br /> <br />I would have walked out early on but it was so bad that I kept thinking that it had to get better. So much for that logic... <br />
B000001ESJ|5.0|I didn't know about Rush until their \\"Vaper Trails\\" CD, after which I read everything and anything I could find them. To be honest I discovered Rush at the right time, because I was just getting into progressive rock and discovering Rush led me to the unbelievable \\"2112\\" CD (which still sends shivers up my spine when I hear it.) <br /> <br />\\"A Farewell to Kings\\" caught my attention because it seemed everyone was debating which was a better prog. CD \\"2112\\" or \\"A Farewell to Kings.\\" So based solely on that debate I bought \\"A Farewell to Kings.\\" To this day \\"A Farewell to Kings\\" is still my favorite LP by Rush.  <br /> <br />I'm actually listening to it as I write this review. It's a CD that I never tire of. It's pure enjoyment. The title song starts off kind of with a Rennasaince sound that grows with birds slowly into a shower of bass and drums and becomes a driving rocker with one of the best bass lines I've ever heard.  <br /> <br />Xanadu - 11 minutes of pure joyment. My sister can't stand it because she doesn't like just music, which is what the first half of the song is. This song is by far the stand out track on the CD refering to an actual poem written by a man on opium, who supposedly dreamed the 130 or so lines but forgot them when he was called to a meeting and Xanadu (the short poem) is the only part he remembered when actually wrote it down. This song reminds me of a girl I knew I considered my best friend before I move and still do. <br /> <br />Closer to the Heart - an outstading song, no wonder it became a hit. My only problem with it is the length, but any longer and it may have not been as great who knows. <br /> <br />Cinderalla Man - If I'm correct it's based off the movie that Mr. Deeds was a remake of. This song is more mellow and melodic than rock driven but by no means is it bad or the low of the CD. In fact there isn't a song on this CD that isn't great. <br /> <br />The last two songs are different lyrically (Madrigal) and musically (CygnusX-1), which when I first listened to it, it reminded me of bands today that do scream-singing, though they don't really scream, the use mostly distortion over their voice. This is a prequel to the main event on Hemispheres which has my favorite epic song on it. But this CD is by far my favorite Rush CD. I would recommend this to anyone and have.

B00005JXY3|5.0|It really brings back some memories I had forgotten...  It is a good film to watch.  Sure there are some silly moments, but all in all, I rate this movie highly because of the introduction to Japanese Culture this movie provided to an entire American Generation.
B00005R2IS|5.0|Enjoyed the movie, I can see why it gave Mel Gibson's career a boost
0140288503|5.0|Outstanding account of this engagement. I have a close friend who was involved. From his account this is the way it went down.
B000I5X81K|4.0|I am always surprised that Groban's voice is as good as I think that it is.  The selections are good and worth listening to again and again.  Share it with others.
B000002UAX|5.0|I have everyone of their albums. This is by far their best. Every song is a can't miss. Gosh I wonder what kind of music they would be putting out had they not broken up and were still together.
B0001CNRBG|4.0|It was just as enjoyable as I remembered it to be.  It was one of Alan Alda's best performances.
B000F48CD8|5.0|While you may not like all the lyrics; you gotta like the musicians.  These guys can play and the music they make transports you.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|The music will stir your celtic soul and take you on a imagined journey of the rolling green landscape of Ireland and the United Kingdom in another time.  <br /> <br />Beautiful music, absolutely beautiful.
B000GUJF4G|5.0|Honestly the movie was ok but to see it on HD is amazing, the picture is so detailed and clear especially when josh lucas is walking down the steps of the ballroom, and when the water pushes the ship over. It really is amazing and honestly its so clear i would purchase this movie to be a demo piece to show off you HD DVD set up.
B000E41MS6|5.0|I've been a fan of Doctor Who for about ten years, and I was absolutely thrilled when I heard it was finally being rescued from its sixteen-year 'hiatus'. I was afraid it wouldn't be the same - the revival of \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" being a prime example. When it finally came to the Sci-Fi Channel in 2006, I watched the first episode, \\"Rose\\", with excitement and trepidation. <br />It had enemies from the 'old' show. It had a new Doctor. It introduced the concept of the Doctor's companion keeping in touch with her family while travelling with the Doctor. And it made me fall in love with 'Doctor Who' all over again.  <br />While the new series has divided fans and earned new ones, I definitely recommend this collection to anyone who wants to get re-acquianted with the Doctor.
B000KN7BIQ|5.0|Honestly i've seen better HD DVD's but still this one is remastered like crazy,its a hell of alot clearer than the original dvd release and its amazing to see what they can do with movies such as old as this one. I mean 1973 this movie comes out and after watching the HD DVD you would think it was a new release. All in all to keep this short this is an amazing film and you should pick it up on HD DVD right now!
B0006L16N8|5.0|great CD... been listening to it since it came out and it never gets old... great to chillout and listen to, enjoy it, and i can't wait for their next cd... they need to hurry up and make another...
B000JMK8R4|5.0|This and Zing are two of the freshest and most creative of the creative thinking books I have read recently.<br /><br />Highly recommend this to help JUST START nad PROVOKE your latent creative thinking.
B000K7VHQE|3.0|Is this a remake of the Griswalds vacation to Wally World?  Hello, it's the same thing, family takes road trip; there is mom and dad, grandfather, son, and daughter in a dysfunctional family.  The grandfather dies on the way.  Notice any similarities yet?  Vehicle breaks down...etc.......could go on.<br /><br />with that aside, it's not a bad movie, it's just that it's not that great.  Characters were annoying and unbelievable.  A goth son wanting to fly jets? wierd, whatever. I don't see this movie breaking any new ground in what it is presenting.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I absolutely love this album but was wondering if anyone knew the song played in the final scene of the movie not listed on the soundtrack? thanks for any help.
B00005MKA3|5.0|Huge Marley fan and this is a top album.  Buy this or be sorry.
B000JLTRIG|2.0|Ive seen a bunch of this season on TV and I dont have this dvd yet but season 7 was pretty darn dull. I found that the avatars and Zankou were on the show way too long. If you found that Cole was a good character but wasted a lot of show space with all of his problems then the avatars and Zankou will have the same effect. Great show iffy season.
B000KCHZK6|1.0|I am normally a huge Nora fan, but I was very disappointed in this CD.  My husband got it as a Valentine's present for me because we love to listen to Nora in the car when we're on long trips.  This CD, however, was so negative.  She shoves her political views down your throat in the majority of the songs on this CD and lacks the amount of lovely ballads that were so strong in her other two CDs.   <br /> <br />I'm all for having strong views about politics and world issues, but she totally alienates anyone that has a different view from her and doesn't allow them to enjoy her music because of the harsh tone she sets.   <br /> <br />I also found the sound of the majority of the songs to be too similar in sound to the Come Away With Me album and one or two to Feels Like Home.  On a few of the songs I could actually sing a couple of lines from the song that it sounded like, and it fit right in.  Sinkin' Soon was my favorite sounding song - very original and fun to listen to - but it was also the most overtly negative song, so I have a hard time enjoying it.   <br /> <br />Don't try to change my political views, Nora, and just do what you do best and move me emotionally with your powerful voice and sweet ballads!
0953104907|4.0|I purchased what were described as the three best books on the market to aid in solid body electric guitar construction.  Hiscock's book was by far the best, very informative, lots of detail.  It doesn't meet the standard of Benedetto's book on archtop construction, or the Cumpiano/Solomon book on acoustics but it is still the best on electrics.  It just takes lots of reading and thinking to learn what you need to know from this book.
032147404X|5.0|Scott Kelby has done it again.  This man, a true photographer, as well as master of Photoshop, as introduced a new travel size book complete with beginner tips and professional ideas and even creative approaches to the smallest or biggest project.  I would consider myself an intermediate photographer and photoshop user, and quickly buying most of Kelby's books, and what a true investment.  I hope someday to meet this man at a convention or something. THANKS AMAZON!!!  THANK YOU SCOTT KELBY!!!
0061127760|5.0|I never read this book as a child because I was a teenager when it was published. Our book group decided to read a good piece of children's literature for a change and we chose Charlotte's Web. We all loved it. Those who had read it as children welcomed the chance to read it with adult eyes. Nobody gave it less than and eight (out of ten) and I gave it a 9 1/2 because in my mind it is an almost perfect book that succeeds on many levels. It is amusing, instructive and also makes you think about how important values are in a life well lived. I hate spiders, but was almost in tears when Charlotte died. I guess I'll have to think twice before I try to squash one. I hope the new movie doesn't cheapen and trivialize this real treasure of children's literature.
0140120416|5.0|This is possibly the most helpful self-teaching book I've ever seen.  If you stick with it and do all the exercises, you'll be shocked at how quickly and how well you learn the language.  Keep in mind that you will still need to either take classes with a live teacher or get an audio teaching course on top of using this book, or your pronunciation will probably be terrible.  I also got some vocabulary flashcards (and make my own for the alphabet), but whether or not you'd find those helpful just depends on how you learn best.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|If you must have a video version of Jane Austen's classic work, then the 95 BBC adaptation is for you.  It is truer than any other adaptation (and I've seen them all) to the spirit, wit, and characters Miss Austen created centuries ago.<br /><br />This version, on the other hand, while it has some redeeming qualities making it worthy of a rental viewing - the scenery, cinematography, and score are uniformly excellent - it is a very poor rendition of P&P.  Although I agree that the youthful energy shown by all 5 Bennet girls is an interesting take on the story, there are so many flaws and wasted opportunities in this work that I cannot in good conscience recommend a purchase.  A short list of the flaws in the script includes:<br /><br />1.  Judi Densch has been deprived of an opportunity to truly shine - I was so looking forward to her rendition of Lady Catherine, which I have no doubt could have been exceptional.  The script eliminated Lady C's best line (\\" I am most seriously displeased\\"), and pretty well hacked out the entire character.  This was a HUGE disappointment.<br /><br />2.  Mr. Bennet, as written, is more of a soft, whipped character, instead of the sharp, although disappointed in marriage, character that Jane created.  Why change the brilliant line in response to Mrs. Bennet's news about netherfield - \\"You wish to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it\\", to \\"You wish to tell me, so I suppose I have no choice\\".  Seems subtle, but this changes the flavor of the character.  And the tears at the end when Lizzie accepts Mr. Darcy seemed completely foreign to the character I knew from the book.<br /><br />3.  Wasted opportunities for character development.  I know that when trying to make a 2hour movie from a novel, that certain subplots must be sacrificed, so I was able to live with the elimination of Mr & Mrs Hurst from the story.  However, when every minute is a premium, why, after Elizabeth hears about Charlotte's engagement, are we subjected to a large chunk of time watching Elizabeth swinging?  That time could have been far better spent.  Also there was a wasted scene at the Netherfield ball showing Mr. Bennet consoling Mary after having asked her to stop playing.  Hello - you're trying to CUT story, not ADD to it.<br /><br />4.  Mr Bingley, in this rendition, is not someone you can see Jane Bennet really falling in love with - the character is rather soft-brained, instead of good-natured.  Again, the scene at the end that is ADDED from the story, showing Darcy helping Bingley to prepare to propose to Jane, very much diminishes his character.  Wasted film time that could have been employed far more profitably.<br /><br />5.  The whole handling of Charlotte's engagement was ham-handed.  Why cut a classic line, when Jane says to Elizabeth, \\"Lizzie, you are not accounting for differences in situation and temperament\\", as Elizabeth tries to reconcile herself to the news.  Instead, we are treated to an out-of-character tirade by Charlotte, with the breathtakingly inappropriate climax of \\"Don't you dare judge me, Lizzie\\".  *sigh*<br /><br />I don't think of myself as a purist who objects to any changes in the story in order to adapt it.  It's just that with very little effort, this film could have been far superior, and that is what I find the most disappointing.of time watching Elizabeth swinging?

B000KCHZK6|5.0|I guess I'm in the lunatic fringe of fans who have listened to this album about 25 times now in the few weeks since it was released, especially during long plane trips back and forth to a distant land. And I wore out Norah's first two albums, too. This one is definitely a change and is not as easy to listen to as the innocence of Come Away With Me and the welcoming beauty of Just Like Home. But the new one is not inconsistent....the new record allows you to listen back to the previous two, and see this one coming. <br /> <br />In the same way that Steely Dan was always mistaken for smooth jazz elevator music, Norah Jones is often mistaken for mellow love music perfect for Valentine's Day. Just as with Steely Dan, there's some degree of truth there: Norah's voice can be soothing, enveloping and loving, like a lullaby. She has an incredibly beautiful voice -- maybe not for all tastes, but definitely mine. She's got the gift to express things a lot of us feel. <br /> <br />On this album, though, she steps forward as a songwriter, with more than just her voice invested in these songs. The message is hers, too, along with Lee Alexander, who co-wrote several tunes, produced the album and is at least an equal partner in creating her sound. I think it's time that he gets some creds for building just the right timbre, tone and depth to set her voice like a jewel in the middle. The instrumentation never detracts or competes. They are definitely helped by all those excellent musicians who've been playing together and with Norah and Lee for a years now. But their musical partnership has been the anchor of it all. <br /> <br />I actually found Feels Like Home to be a pretty riveting album emotionally...far from being just mellow background lovey-dovey music. \\"Sunrise\\" to me is full of double meanings and depicts this rather difficult relationship situation, and the record goes on from there, all the way to ambiguous \\"I Don't Miss You at All.\\" So, here is this one starting off with \\"Wish I Could,\\" again about a pretty complex emotional situation where the singer can't really reveal all of what she's feeling to \\"Annie,\\" standing in the door. Who is Annie? Door to what? And what was the \\"path he found\\"? <br /> <br />Anyway, the album goes on from there with I think not a weak song in the bunch. Lots of different kinds of songs, some just playful, others serious. I hope they bring a string quartet and trombones when they perform this stuff live, though! <br /> <br />As for the \\"political\\" songs, Sinkin Soon is funny as hell, a drunken tune with a great trombone solo! And Election Day I took as being about, well, election day: not so much Bush specifically or anyone else specifically. She captures her impressions of that time, and again, like a lot of her songs, it has multiple dimensions. There are many ways to interpret what she's got here. I don't think people who support Bush or who are trying to hang in there and see this Iraq situation out to a successful end should be offended. To me, like Springsteen's The Rising, these are a poet/writer/songwriter's impressions, not blunderbuss obvious political rants like you get from other bands. <br /> <br />So, I would say for Norah's fans beyond the lunatic fringe, don't dismiss this album too quickly. At least a few of the songs are going to grab you right away (like the beautiful \\"Wake Me Up\\"), and the rest seem to find their way in time. Plus, wow: what rich musical influences are apparent in what Norah and Lee have here...something we haven't heard since maybe The Band's great music. Dashes of Fats Waller, Duke Ellington, Randy Newman, Lucinda Williams all mixed together in the great American tradition. And, ah: natural, real instruments and real good musicians playing them! Techno takes a holiday. Thank you!

B000JBWWRY|4.0|I, too, am anxiously awaiting this 2-disc release.  All of the Disney Platinum Editions so far have been superb and Peter Pan, as noted by most reviewers, is certainly one of Disney's finest achievements!  It is full of wonderful special effects (the first use of \\"Pixie Dust\\", I believe), lush backgrounds, animation at the top of its form, memorable characters, and many fleeting but wonderful little touches (be sure to catch the look on Nana's face when she is reminded that she is a dog, and the perplexed expression of a real bear as he contemplates Michael's stuffed Teddy Bear!).  These were the things that made Disney Disney, and separated them from all other pretenders to the throne!  It's all here, in Peter Pan.   <br /> <br />In spite of all the plusses that this edition promises, however, I must express one major disappointment.  It doesn't look as though they have included the rare early Disney outing into Television: \\"The Walt Disney Christmas Show\\", aired on December 25, 1951.  THAT would have given this set the extra star!  The show featured Kathryn Beaumont (Wendy), Bobby Driscoll(Peter), Paul Collins (John) and Tommy Lusk (Michael), and heavily promoted the up-coming animated feature.  I have been waiting and waiting for them to release this.  The first Disney Christmas show from 1950 was released as part of the laser disc special box-set edition of Alice in Wonderland. I believe the show is also on the special two-disc DVD edition of that film, although it is not listed as one of the special features.  This SECOND Disney Christmas Show, however, is still gathering dust in the vaults somewhere.  I know that it still exists, though, since I had seen it in presented some years ago at the Museum of Television Arts in NYC.  <br /> <br />One final comment: for the reviewer who correrctly complained to those who look for widescreen versions of films that were never made widescreen:  The first widescreen film was not the King and I in 1956, but rather The Robe,in 1953 (Cinemascope).  The first Disney outing in cinemascope was Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom, also released in 1953, and Disney's first widescreen animated feature was Lady and the Tramp (1954).
B000M5AJQS|4.0|I first heard of this remake of Infernal Affairs a year after seeing the original film. At the time I was interested mainly since Scorsese's was listed as the director which gave the film more heat than a remake like Pulse or The Grudge. Then I heard of changes made to the film, or an outlandish sex scene involving Nicholson's Frank and two prostitutes. The film began to take a lot of flak before it was even released and upon hearing the changes to the ending I was very hesitant to see it. And then of course the movie came out, and Scorsese delivered a remake that was as good as he could do it. It exceded my expectations in several ways. <br />I don't feel like going into a whole synopsis of the film. So the long and short of it. Sometime in the past mob boss Frank Costello insinuates young Colin Sullivan into his gang keeping him at arms length to use him for a plan to infiltrate Boston's state police. At the same time Colin is coming up in the police ranks, Billy Costigan is recruited by the police to infiltrate Costigan's gang. Soon both spys are filtering information to their secret bosses. During a suprise sale of microchips to Chinese gangsters both the criminals and the cops learn information that alerts both organizations to the presence of the infiltrators leading the moles in a headlong chase to track each others identities down. <br />This is a very good crime drama despite what some might say. Unlike the critics who gushed over it last year calling it the best film of the year, I think that was going a bit far but it is far better than even I expected it to. Part of it is that unlike remakes which seem to aim to keep the spirit of the original Scorsese gives the film an air that is comparable to his own films. Infernal Affairs had slick surface that made the whole film sleek and fast. The Departed is more realistic down in the dirt and grit of the streets that its presenting. Its realistic in preventing the organization of both the cops and the criminals, and doesn't haven't have that film like quality that made Affairs more of a thriller. I liked that it was a long film as well taking the time to tell its story and flesh out its characters nicely. And except Nicholson who seemed to be reveling in going near the edge of being over the top without commiting so fully the cast was great with Damon again showing that he could be labeled the best actor of his generation with excellent support from Mark Whalberg, Alec Baldwin, and Vera Farmiga. <br />Everything in the film is good, but one thing holds it from being great. As good as everything is a lot of what made Infernal Affairs a great experience is the suprises it held in its plot. There were several deaths of major characters that were shocking and powerful in way. Here knowing who was going to die took all the suprise out. I guess I could warn you if you wanted to watch this one before the Affairs series, but that doesn't keep it from being a flaw. What ever the movie does well its always going to be a remake, retreading over what some else had done before. Despite this the films worth seeing for fans of the genre, or Scorsese.  <br />The two disc set is somewhat of a disappointment. Continuing Warner Bros lackluster treatment of releasing a one disc version and a two disc version I have yet to be impressed with extras on the two disc version. Here we have about three whole extras relegated to the second disc. One is a Documentary called Scorsese on Scorsese which I haven't viewed, a documentary on The Departed and the boston crime scene focusing on Whity Bulger, an influence on Nicholsons Costello, and nine deleted scenes with an introduction by Scorsese. Thats it. Theres no making of the film, no interviews with cast and crew, no commentary. For a film that is the forerunner for this years best picture oscar this is somewhat a let down in my opinion. Even The Aviator at least provided information on OCD or Hughes in general while also having a commentary from Scorsese. So in my opinion if you buy the film its best to go with the one disc unless you wanna be burned by a few features that aren't as interesting as they could be. Thats my opinion anyway.
0316172324|4.0|This book is a very entertaining one from cover to cover.  It is delightfully written (I imagine that Gladwell is a great conversationalist - the writing is very smooth and pleasing).   <br /> <br />Other reviewers have attacked this book because the writer is not a cognitive expert - they have questioned his credentials and conclusions.  This is not a textbook, it's a popular treatment.  The author discusses intuition not on the level of psychology professors but on the level of average readers.  In my view he does this very well.  The author takes an anecdotal approach - each aspect of his theory is supported by his analysis of an event, sometimes backed by interviews with experts.   <br /> <br />In short, a new take on the idea of intuition that is accessible to the common man, and presented in an entertaining and thought-provoking style.
B0000WN0ZK|2.0|I watched this film recently after having enjoyed the soundtrack for years.  I found the film to be weak on suspense, character development, and pacing.  The plot was nearly absent.  I suppose the style of photography and editing could be useful to a student of film history, but for the rest of us who actually want to see a movie that we can be pulled in by and enjoy, this is an utter waste of time. I don't know how Cortazar felt about this adaptation of his work, but I'm sure it wasn't a happy feeling.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|See \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" if you haven't already.  Ignore that it's a documentary--it's funny, fascinating, and moving.  This film deserves to be seen,and it's a shame that because it's a documentary about global warming people may unfairly dismiss it as dull or as propaganda. If only 50% of the data in this film is true, this is a wake-up call of the first magnitude. Forget what you think you know about global warming (there's a wonderful parallel in the film with the debunked skepticism about the connection between cigarettes and lung cancer); forget what you think you know about Al Gore--he is funny, he is entertaining, he is incredibly self-assured, and he knows what he's talking about. He is NOT new to this. The format changes with some of his ruminations about his own life, with some beautiful pix of the family farm, and a few political gibes, but most of this is science, told with film, told with special effects, told with incredible graphics, told with humor, told with urgency. The 90 minutes or so will rush by. This isn't politics; this is survival. Watch it with your kids--they'll get it.
B000025XKM|4.0|Being a big fan of Iron & Wine, Sufjan, Joshua Radin, Elliott Smith, and Damien Rice, I thought I would try out this CD (also bought \\"Five Leaves Left\\"), as he seems to be an original...and I was impressed.  Nick's guitar work is very solid, his lyrics poignant, his voice mellow, and his songs strong.  The CD whips through quickly with its short songs (too short!), and I could definitely hear his influence in the modern day singers I mentioned above.  Although I prefer the modern singers, this CD definitely will work its way into my rotation.  I definitely recommend this album for those that enjoy this type of music...if you prefer Iron & Wine over Blackeyed Peas, or Sufjan over Timberlake, or Radin, Elliott, and Rice over Maroon 5, then you must buy this CD.  But do like I did...wait until Amazon puts it for sale under $10.00.

B000LC3ID8|5.0|Saw III is right up there with the first one.  The storyline has a great twist, the effects are way life-like looking and gorey and the traps are more brutal than ever.  Alot of things were brought full circle from the 1st two films in this 3rd installment.  The SAW series is a true horror classic up there with Michael Myers, Freddy, Michael and LeatherFace.  Hope there will be a forth and beyond!!!

B000INAXHE|5.0|So I had to buy the import with the remixes opposed to just getting the single CD. Its not like I don't have all of Jamiroquai's other 6 cd's but what they don't have are \\"Deeper Underground\\", \\"Runaway\\", and \\"Radio\\", and the Remixes on CD 2 of course. And if you listen closely, some of the songs are a little different than the original CD recordings.  \\"Space Cowboy\\", for example, is the Video version, which is found on their \\"High Times\\" DVD. For all the True Jamiroquai Fans, go out and get the Import and spend the extra money. Its worth it!!!! Love u Jay....
B000IU3XTM|5.0|Damien has his heart broken yet again and in this latest installment his music is like whoa; I can actually feel your pain, ouch, musta been some girl. This album is like the perfect blend of piano, violin and belief. <br /> <br />At least a few of us carry broken hearts, some broken a little bit more often than others, some not at all or perhaps we've just gotten better at hiding it... perhaps not. Albeit it's good to know that Damien Rice is out there, sadder than us all. <br /> <br />May I suggest downloading 9 crimes and accidental babies.

0743289684|5.0|If you value liberty, you will weep as you witness this brave woman's story. <br /> <br />Like Lawrence Wright's The Looming Tower: Al-Qaeda and the Road to 9/11, the viewpoint of this book will appeal across political lines.  It's impossible to ascribe political tendencies of 'liberal' or 'conservative' to the author.  How can that be, you might wonder, if the author is a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute?  Do your daughter a favor and read Ayaan Hirsi Ali's story to find out.  The author would seem to be as welcome on Oprah's show as Glen Beck's: Her story trancends political differences and will remind the reader of what it means to value humanity.  <br /> <br />When you read this book, note that she refused to compromise while a politician and spoke her mind to the Dutch people, even when her views conflicted with her party.  This is a woman who stands for what is right, and that will make her popular with those that value reason and unpopular with those that accept dogma, whether it be religious or political. <br /> <br />She writes \\"I also don't want my reasoning to be dismissed as the bizarre ranting of someone who has been somehow damaged by her experiences and who is lashing out.\\"  No one who reads this book could possibly think such a thing.  I'm amazed with the evenhandedness she is able to exert in this memoir.  <br /> <br />If, like my wife, you wonder \\"where are my feminists\\" in the face of islamic extremism, you will find a new hero. <br />

0375505091|5.0|I have found this book to be a treasure that I'll enjoy for years to come.  The photographs are windows into the artist's soul.  I can gaze at a page for a very long time.  I feel like I have my own photo-art gallery sitting on my table.  I think it is a very personal undertaking and am very thankful that the author/artist decided to share this with us.  I'm so glad that you had this available.
B000001FA4|1.0|Naming your album after a sacred desert plant is one thing, but naming your work after the Burning Bush in the Old Testament is just downright arrogant. But you know, Bono has Vatican fever and if he ever gets to wear the funny hat, he'll start shipping nukes to Africa and that'll be the end to all this global warming and starvation nonsense. I mean, it's like Grandma Moses used to say, \\"If you can't handle the mundanity, light your taint on fire with a match and concentrate on the pain.\\" And I haven't even gotten to the music yet: It sounds like Mr. \\"Wizard\\" Eno dipped the music into a chemical batter, like he was developing film in the darkroom. I think it's supposed to be art; well, OK, if we're talking about those paintings where it's just a small dot in the center of the canvas, then I get the connection. If you're into murky production and Bono's tight-scrotum vocal pleadings, this is the one you've been waiting for, so grab a few dollars, hit the used bin and let the aural sex begin. Me, I just fell asleep and Bug Eyes and Co. are serenading me as we ride a magic rainbow cloud to lala land, where a benefit is taking place to help support oppressed oompaloompas.

B0002V7O3I|3.0|My son and I agree with another reviewer that it was good until the end, when they came up with these poorly designed rubber aliens, with really bad lines.  I do not agree that the foul language was necessary, it really never is.  There are many young people who do not use that kind of language, even with their peers.  This is a fun movie for younger children, except for the language, which is mild and infrequent compared to most movies.
1400064287|5.0|What a refreshing, brilliant, and simple read!  First of all, not only was this well-researched book hilarious, but it's actually applicable to all professions and situations in all walks of life.  That's rare when reading what I thought was a book geared just towards business people.  I could actually see myself using these principles to make my ideas stick with my family and friends, especially my fiance. <br /> <br />This memorable book was shockingly informative, too.  It was filled with impressive academic resarch to support the points and a plethora of well-thought-out examples of what actually differentiaties a sticky idea from the sea of \\"marketing clutter.\\"  I was surprised to discover that many of those urban legends were simply only urban legends. <br /> <br />To the authors: thanks for giving me intelligent and viable tips to help make my personal and professional life better.
B0000931QA|5.0|This is flat-out the best rock album to come out of the eighties.  So many great songs on this one, I don't know where to start.  My favorites are Revolution Calling (I love the vocals in this one), Operation Mindcrime, The Mission, I Don't Believe In Love, and Eyes Of A Stranger.  Think of what an ambitious project this concept album was for a band riding the 80's hair wave.  The most amazing thing about this album is that, while it is a concept album and tells a great story, each song is brilliant and fantastic-sounding in it's own right.  You can pluck any song off this album and play it individually, and it works.  I have the entire Queensryche catalog and like everything they've ever done (especially Rage For Order and Empire) but this is the pinnacle of their career.  Anyone who claims to be a fan of good rock and roll must have this album in their collection.
B00005JLPK|5.0|...At least in this genre. It is the story of life itself. It is the story of triumph of humanity and a compelling example of basic human spirit in its true nature to be basically noble.<br /><br />To this is added another of the many possible features of our humanity which exist seemingly almost randomly in humans- namely colorful, lively and spirited disposition, beauty and appreciation of beauty. It shows that the pain and misery of the reality which is human life is eventually worth living. And that is because life is beautiful and the world is a truly beautiful place not least because of this unique animal and its fallible humanity.<br /><br />And it also shows that it is humanity itself which is solely able to understand this beauty especially/or those in the world of spirit (as Frida Kahlo is a great example). It has been able to catch the very spirit of a human being, a spirit which in its uncorrupted and virtuous form is common to all humanity. Perhaps thats the very meaning of it.<br /><br />Finally, it is a proof of the fact that beauty is as much in the object beheld as it is in the beholder. (I believe 'beauty lies in the eye of the beholder' is a wrong philosophy, or at least half true, and such philosophies often come to be understood as negation of the other possibility as for example the above is a result of such popular ideas as relativism etc).<br /><br />Frida Kahlo is a person who is broken inside and outside. She wields a broken body and a broken heart but she has an invincible spirit. She is beaten by the stick that is life only for her to love it more each and every time. In the final battle the spirit triumphs to which she testified as such:<br /><br />In the last painting short while before she died she signed it Viva La Vida, translated approximately as Long live Life. In her diary her last words were \\"I hope the exit is joyful; and I hope never to return. This was a woman who was almost an atheist (father Jewish, mother devout Christian and husband atheist), a communist who supported Stalin passionately and helped him win some public support in Latin America, was highly impressed with Mao and was a Lesbian.<br /><br />In short, she lived a highly impassioned, acutely aware and spirited and colorful life. Even though it was highly scandalous and sinful this was a kind of a rebellion of the spirit against the so called morality (morality for the sake of morality) and societal righteousness. Almost saintly yet so blasphemous!<br /><br />To understand and fully appreciate the movie, the woman and the times; preliminary understanding of art is highly recommended though not necessary- more certainly would help. A sense of history and culture of the time and an interest in Latin history and culture especially would be of great use.<br /><br />The acting of all cast is breathtaking especially of Salma Hayek, Alfred Molino and even that of small roles like Diegos first wifes and the Latino singers etc. Frida is primarily a musical with an extraordinary and heart rending music score comprised of much ethnic and folk music and a blend of beautiful modern songs. Finally the highest prize and the crown of the effort I think should go to the director who has done a tremendous and almost perfect job. Notice for example the different camera affects and color schemed employed. For example, Fridas silhouette almost always is strikingly colorful in the foreground compared to drab and almost colorless rest of the world. The movie has immense but subtle details.<br /><br />I would highly recommend reading about Frida Kahlo and going through her art and biogrpahy. Her life is a real life Tolstoy or Jane Austin novel or even Shakespears play or Emily Dickinson poetry!<br /><br />The wonderful tiring puzzle!<br /><br />The merciless beautiful flower!<br /><br />Viva La Vida!<br /><br />Truly the movie itself is a work of great art. Two thumbs up.<br /><br />P.S. some links and material about her I highly recommend.<br /><br />check here on amazon, her diary at least and the PBS documentry on her is must. the browser is not allowing me to post the linksks and material about her I highly recommend. <br /> <br />check here on amazon, her diary at least and the PBS documentry on her is must. the browser is not allowing me to post the links  <br />  <br />

B000J103PC|3.0|What \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" lacks in substance and originality, it makes up for in scenery.  Lots of sexy, haute couture clothing fills the screen (and, if you listen to the commentary, you'll be treated to a piece by piece deconstruction of it all), and they are usually adorned by equally sexy actors and actresses, most of whom are required to do little more than wink and show off a sultry moue.<br /><br />The story, about fish-out-of-water Andy Sachs (a cute-as-a-button Anne Hathaway) trying to make it as second assistant to the domineering ice queen Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), opts for easy outs every step of the way.  You have the Ugly Duckling Transformation (which isn't nearly as remarkable as this movie wants us to believe it is; Hathaway's good looks are tousled, not hidden, at the start of the film), the Crisis of Conscience (which is also hard to swallow; Andy \\"betrays\\" one of the most unlikeable characters in the film), and the Call to Reality (which includes one of the most over-used lines in film history: \\"You've become one of them.\\").<br /><br />Does Andy become one of \\"them\\" (\\"Them,\\" in this case, being overly critical, weight-obssessed fashionistas)?  No.  Not really.  Unless you call wearing better clothing and working a lot more becoming one of \\"them.\\"  It's hard to imagine a different outcome, when you are working as the assistant to the Editor-In-Chief of one of the world's largest fashion magazines.  Andy's friends (and, specifically, her milquetoast-dull boyfriend, Nate) exist like props to propel the barely-there moral agenda.  They are supposed to show us Andy's earthy, Good Time roots (they playfully toss her phone around when she gets a call from Miranda; what fun!), but they are also there to let the audience know when Andy has Gone Too Far (according to this movie, getting an unsolicited kiss on the cheek is enough to convict someone of infidelity).<br /><br />That's dismissable.  What this movie is really about is Streep's icy Priestly, a tough, shale-edged woman who, if you look closely enough, lets a little humanity shine through her facade.  Streep restrains herself admirably, turning what could've been a one-note character into an entire symphony.  She is also aided by the excellent work of Stanley Tucci who plays Nigel, one of Priestly's helmsmen.<br /><br />Both of these characters (and the actors who give them life) take what could easily have been a horribly trite film and turn it into something that is, if not remarkable, then at least interesting.  The film tries hard to get us to see how Andy has sold out, how she has co-opted her dreams in order to Fit In, but all any intelligent viewer will see is just how fun and exciting Andy's world is once she DOES fit in (and she does it so well).  It's an odd little movie that makes the uncompromising boss seem like the most sympathetic character, while the Family And Friends seem like little more than whiny obstacles, but that doesn't make it bad.<br /><br />Of course, the ending is to be expected, and it feels as if it's been lifted straight out of a Hallmark card, but the real ending is, like most of the movie, all Streep's.  If Andy is the angel fallen from grace, seduced by a well-dressed demon, then this movie is all about sympathy for the devil.  And even if you can't swallow that, you still get to look at a lot of pretty shoes.y Priestly, a tough, shale-edged woman who, if you look closely enough, lets a little humanity shine through her facade.

0141184884|5.0|Kerouac's natural audience was the young. I read him when<br /><br />I was fourteen and able to see just a tiny part of the world.<br /><br />What he did for me and for my generation was to suggest<br /><br />a universe that was different in its ultimate orientation<br /><br />to what was good.<br /><br />All of a sudden, the simple, the obvious, the severely plain<br /><br />and widely available pleasures were valued. Mountains, beaches,<br /><br />box cars. Not only that, but his heroes were Buddhist-Japanese,<br /><br />Chinese and Indian and his world-view was from a meditation mat.<br /><br />We barely noticed his speed-crazed prose or the almost complete<br /><br />lack of a plot.<br /><br />Reading Kerouac was like hanging out with a magical friend who<br /><br />cut away the cords that tied us to conventional American life<br /><br />in the fifties and sixties. Indeed, you could say that the sixties,<br /><br />for many of us, began with this book.<br /><br />The Dharma Bums is fifty years old now. The young are<br /><br />imprisoned in different ways today and the boxcar<br /><br />bodhisattvas seem  irrelevant. Perhaps they are.I don't<br /><br />imagine that my daughter and her friends dream of<br /><br />spending a summer alone in a firetower or reading poetry<br /><br />in a smoky coffee house.<br /><br />And yet this was the book that set their parents free,<br /><br />started a revolution that made their world.<br /><br />--Lynn Hoffman, author of THE NEW SHORT COURSE IN WINE and<br /><br />the forthcoming novel bang BANG from Kunati Books.ISBN<br /><br />9781601640005
B000002JSJ|4.0|Review no. 193. Originally released in 1976, as this was the follow-up to their double-album landmark 'Physical Graffiti' (see my review). I've always liked 'Presence' - Zeppelin's seventh actual / proper lp - it's just the album cover that I felt was a bit lame. No matter - with the best tracks being the ten-minute opener of a masterpiece (as far as I'm concerned) &#34;Achilles Last Stand&#34;, the total blues-rocking (bomb) &#34;Nobody's Fault But Mine&#34;, the rockabilly-like &#34;Candy Store Rock&#34; and the somewhat funky &#34;Hots On To Nowhere&#34;. Long live the great Zeppelin! Recommended.

B00000JNOJ|5.0|What a great blues album! I just received it in the mail, and this is one of those CD's that exceeds all expectations. First, I was floored by the sound quality - hi-res with beaucoups of air and a realistic soundstage. As I continued through the disc, it became obvious that this CD belongs on a short list of the best blues albums ever made because the performances were incredible! No folk songs here - it's all acoustic blues with Willie Dixon on bass and Buddy Guy on guitar accompanying Muddy. The bonus tracks are all keepers too. This is absolutely essential blues, and music for the ages.

B00005JPE7|3.0|Stallone is in great shape! He looks awesome for his age. He surely had one last Rocky Balboa fight in him. But I feel certain elements that made the Rocky series great are missing. Firstly Mickey, the legendary motivational trainer. Perhaps Stallone is afraid of Mickey's shadow, who knows... but I missed flashback clips of Mickey ( and saw too much of Rocky's wife ). Secondly, the legendary training sequences. Stallone owns a restaurant, and after retirement, it seems he remains in heavy weight champion shape! I loved the parts in the other Rocky movies, where you could see him rebuilding his body, getting it into shape. And thirdly, the fight sequences. I am a boxing fan and would have liked to see him having flashbacks of himself struggling, fighting, reliving those great achievements, fights and opponents in his mind, like any retired fighter would do. Strategizing and planning his up and coming fight. NOTHING of Apollo Creed ( C Weathers ), Clubber Lang ( Mr. T ), Captain Ivan Drago ( D Ludgren )... But the movie caries a powerful message: you have to find and be yourself, no matter what others say about you. Even if you are past the \\"sell by\\" date. All in all, Stallone remains my favorite action hero of all time. I remember as a child, being so excited about his movies, especially the Rambo series, that I couldn't sleep at night. I've always felt that any one in the Rambo series deserved an oscar.

0765310015|4.0|Erikson has created really compelling characters and an original world.  There is sometimes confusion from his lack of description of races, animals, beings, and places.  I am about 2/3 of the way into book two and am not sure what soletaken or D'ivers exacly are.  It is not too confusing but I would like to see more of the main characters carried over to the second book, who knows when we will get back to them.  Also it is a bit difficult because the series seems to be describing an actual Earth-like scope of events taking place on several continents.  I am not huge into fantasy, more of a Martin and Jordan type of reader, so this book has a little bit too much magic, races, and other fantasy elements for me.  The immense power that shows up all constantly is a bit overwhelming (mages, warlocks, demons, superior races, Gods or ascendents, soletaken, shifters, natural spirits, and many other beings make up this world).  It makes the reader wonder what normal people can even do in a world like that, or why they would even try with so many other powerful forces around them.  It is pretty interesting how much history the world has though, I just wish some things were described a little bit better.  Very strong and well developed characters though which I think really carries the book.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|I think it is cool because since they took complete liberty with the original tracks and totally remixed them (not just remastered), then they were able to employ the most modern recording techniques available and make it sound \\"new\\". Would I do that with Sgt. Pepper or the White Album? No, I would leave them as is, because they are masterpieces as they stand, and you don't want to go remixing those. <br /> <br />So when you hear Love, it does not sound like an \\"old\\" group. This is great for appealing to a whole new generation of beatles fans that want not only top notch sound quality, but also something with more of a \\"pop\\" to the sound - you know, pumped up like today's recordings are. Most kids today would think that the original beatles recordings sound \\"thin\\". <br /> <br />Of course, since it is the genius of George Martin, he has all of the original tracks available to him. (Not just the mixdowns, but original individual vocal tracks, guitars, drums, etc.) It is an art in itself the way he has woven those tracks together into a tapestry. <br /> <br />I am sure some purists will complain about the little snippets of other songs that you hear here and there throughout the mix, but I think that is part of the fun! <br /> <br />Maybe it is just me - being a former stoner and having \\"experimented\\" with the ultimate and original \\"psychedelic\\" substance, but I think that this disc holds true to the psychedelia of the Beatles.  <br /> <br />It starts out pretty etherial in nature with the acapela \\"Because\\", and continues to induce psychedelic imagery here and there through the first 12 tracks, most notably the \\"Gnik Nus\\" (Sun King played backwards.) <br /> <br />Then, by the time you get to the middle of the disc, it becomes an out and out psychedelic explosion. The center cuts (Strawberry Fields Forever -> Within You Without You/Tomorrow Never Knows -> Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds) is truly the \\"peak\\" of this tripper's delight. <br /> <br />There are times when theadded orchestration gives you that \\"show tune\\" effect. I can really see this being the soundtrack for a show - as if a story is being told. <br /> <br />Of course, with the name of the disc being \\"Love\\", one can expect the finale to be \\"All You Need Is Love.\\" <br />

B000E9910W|5.0|The Very Best of The Doobie Brothers is an tremendously comprehensive two disk set that has all the band's hits as well as favorite album tracks.  This set essentially combines and expands on the band's 1976's Best Of and 1981's Best Vol. 2.  Some of the songs are trimmed down to their single version, but that is made up for the sheer volume of tracks covering everything from Toulouse Street to 2000's Sibling Rivalry.  The interesting and unique track listings make this a must own Doobie Brothers collection.

B000ION79Y|1.0|I've been a longtime fan of Seagal's movies, but I was greatly disappointed by this film.  First, there were clearly sections where Steven Seagal's voice was done by a different actor who sounds nothing like him. (Clearly done when the film was cut together after the main filming) It was surprising that they could not take the time to get Seagal to do the vocal tracks for those sections.  There were also very few action sequences that demonstrated Seagal's skills with martial arts.  In many ways, this film was more of a slasher flick than an action film. Little action, but lots of bloody corpses lying about.  I enjoyed Black Dawn far more, and feel it was a much better made film.

B000000XB9|5.0|This is a great compilation title of Creedence Clearwater Revival. Containing 20 of most of their well-known songs, it is definitely worth getting. The most likeable titles are here: Proud Mary, Suzie Q, Up Around the Bend, Down on the Corner, I Heard it Through the Grapevine, Fortunate Son, etc. This album has far more song titles than their first compilation, Creedence Gold, but it doesn't quite have every single one of their songs throughout their career. On this CD title, I Heard It Through the Grapevine is in its full version, clocking in at barely over 11 minutes (the cassette tape of Chronicle, Vol. 1 had the song in shortened form). Suzie Q runs for 4:35 seconds on Vol. 1 and the other part of the song runs for 3:48 seconds on Chronicle, Vol. 2. For those of you who prefer hearing Suzie Q in its full version of over 8 minutes, it is on Creedence Gold. It makes more sense than changing from Chronicle Volume 1 to Volume 2 to hear the full song. I also think that it is a lot better and more appropriate to have all of their main hit songs on one single CD, because buying all of their regular studio albums on CD for all of these songs is a waste of time and money. The Creedence albums that you should have are Creedence Gold and Chronicle, Volumes 1 and 2. These three titles would seem to be the proper and more thorough collection of their music, unless you find a box set, but that will be more costly. Get this first Chronicle; you won't regret it!!

The book is informative, entertaining, practical and engaging all at the same time.  While I simply read through the book initially, I like the fact that it contains exercises to better help learn and understand the material covered.  The authors stay true to the book in that it is obviously well researched, yet does not read like a dry academic paper.  Finally, while readers will run across some information that may seem common sense, the value of the book is in how comprehensive the material covered, as well as gaining new insights on old ideas.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

It only went for a little over an hour and we all know that Guns N' Roses concerts went on average 2/3 hours and includes a drum solo, Slash's solo, and Duff's solo, and you can always count on Axl's rantings and ravings of abuse at the croud. However these were all edited out of this DVD. If you want to see a more complete concert I suggest the Use Your Illusions I & II or if you want to see Axl in all his glory then Welcome To Destruction 2004 is a must, it's the footage of the St. Louis concert complete with Axl leaping into the crowd to take out a fan as well as a security guard and cause a riot. MUST HAVE!
0060723513|1.0|There is much wisdom to be gained from Aboriginal culture, but the \\"wisdom\\" in this book is NOT Aboriginal, but rather made up by the author.  She should have based her book on real Aborigines and shared their true culture, or based it on a totally fictional population.  That way readers would not believe the lies she tells about Australia.  The book does make one think about the many flaws of our western culture which is good, but to do so while corrupting a native culture is simply appalling.  She should not be profiting from this book.
0618680004|5.0|This book is among the best, if not the best book I have ever read.  It is very thought provoking and interesting.  It will teach you to question things from several different angles.  It puts several myths to rest; and provides intelligent and experienced arguments that prove postulates in favor of god are wrong or just plain silly.  This book should be read by everyone who has ever questioned if there is a god, thinks there is a god, or thinks no harm is done by religion.   <br />As a controversial book fighting against fundamentalism, expect harsh ratings.  Religion doesn't want this book to be read. <br />
0451169514|2.0|I feel that it is fair to warn anyone that is planning to invest their time in a book of this scope and magnitude that you may not be happy in the end. I have never written an online review before because usually when I read a great book most people already feel that its great and the existing reviews speak for themselves. However, as I was reading through these reviews, I could not believe how many 5 star ratings people gave. This is not nearly the masterpiece that it could have been and I think people deserve fair warning and a review that is more than: greatest book ever man! First off let me say this, I love horror stories, I am not easily offended, and I have read and enjoyed many other King books in the past. With that in mind, I started reading IT and was immediately absorbed into the tale.<br /><br />SO FIRST THE GOOD (EVEN GREAT):<br /><br />1) great buildup, some genuinely scary and disturbing scenes<br /><br />2) realistic character development and compelling characters in general<br /><br />3) IT is a very original, strange and frightening creature...most of the way through<br /><br />4) childhood events, friendships, conflicts, and experiences are realistically portrayed and sometimes even more frightening and tense than the encounters with the supernatural.<br /><br />5) Despite other peoples complaints with the length, I feel that it flowed nicely and the way the novel slowly revealed events of the past while building suspense in the present time was wonderfully done.<br /><br />SO WHY DID I GIVE THE BOOK 2 STARS? -- This book COMPLETELY falls apart in the last 100 pages or so. So much so that I had to shake my head and wonder if I was even reading the same book. I knew the ending would never live up to the buildup and I was willing to accept that, but what King came up with could not have been written any worse. When IT is revealed, the revelation is anti-climactic to say the least. Even then however, I still would have given the book 5 stars. What angered me to no end was the direction the book went from here. What was a scary foray into a world of creatures, nightmares, and psychological intrigue became a laughably bad mystical and celestial mess that changed the tone of the entire novel. Be warned, the final conflict and resolution is completely ridiculous and ruins what was a masterpiece of horror.<br /><br />PARTIAL SPOILERS (though they dont give away anything major, heres a little of what you are in for)<br /><br />1) a turtle god that barfed up our universe<br /><br />2) floating disembodied tongue the someone bites into<br /><br />3) the deadlights (dont ask, it won't matter)<br /><br />4) a weak and pitiful IT that can simply not be the same cunning and dastardly creature from the first 3/4s of the novel (yet is)<br /><br />5)unsatisfying and weak explanation as to how IT is hurt (I understand what King was trying to do, but it doesnt come across well in the end)<br /><br />LASTLY: IF NONE OF THAT TURNED YOU OFF, PICTURE THIS: A group of six 11 year olds (yes, thats right 11!--all boys, 1 girl) are running around lost in some tunnels. And what is their solution for finding their why out?? Why, a group orgy of course. Im sorry, but even if it had something to do with the story line (which it doesn't) a scene like that is sick and uncalled for on so many levels. Beyond that, it makes no sense and is completely unrealistic after all the previous wonderful character development. Further, the scene is not even merely alluded to, it is specific and explicit bordering on child porn. Why that was included, I cannot begin to guess. It does make good evidence for my theory though: King HAD to have been on something when he wrote in the whole ending.<br /><br />Read if you must, but realize, I am not making any of this up. I sit here stunned and in disbelief as to how such a great novel could turn into such a train wreck. In an epic of this depth, a complete, sloppy letdown in the end is simply inexcusable.

His life experiences are quite apparent as he details those incidents in his life which form his views.  I'm quite impressed with his life, his dedication, and his experiences.  Also, he has clear ideas about how to solve problems, rather than just slapping at them.  It's clear also, that he can think on his feet.  Our book club had quite a go-around in discussing this book.  Everyone wanted to speak at once.  Good stuff.

B000BRBA8S|5.0|2046 is one those films where the beauty is not just in the visuals. The essence of the film is gorgeous, slow, and haunting. The stars sizzle, especially Tony Leung, Zhang Ziyi, and Gong Li. Zhang's character transforms from a confident and lazy seductress into a heartbroken and vulnerable little girl after her affair with Tony. Her character gets sadder and sadder throughout the film as she realizes Tony can never return the love she feels for him and was using her. The film's sadness is compounded by each character falling for the one they cannot have, will never have.
B0000ADY9I|5.0|\\"The Allman Brothers Band at the Fillmore East\\" has been long regarded as one of the greatest live albums of all time. Indeed by the time 1971 rolled around, the ABB was on a musical roll honening their musical chops to perfection. When they hit the Fillmore East for the recording of this album, the band was definitely on fire.<br /><br />The original release of the \\"Fillmore East\\" album (which is still available as a single CD) includes seven of the best tracks from these concerts. Later on, more music from the Fillmore concerts showed up on subsequent albums and compilations - notably 1972's \\"Eat A Peach\\". Now, with the release of the two-disc \\"Deluxe Edition\\", all of the music released from these historic performances are together in one place. While this shouldn't be taken as a complete concert (which by the way is not), it's truly the music that matters.<br /><br />The Allmans' blues chops are in full force here as represented by the opening five tracks - among them being \\"Statesboro Blues\\", \\"Trouble No More\\" and \\"Stormy Monday\\". Duanne Allman's slide guitar work is at its best here and brother Gregg's soulful vocals never falter.<br /><br />As the music progresses, so does the flawless musicianship within the band. The 13-minute \\"In Memory Of Elizabeth Reed\\" and the 19-minute jams of \\"You Don't Love Me\\" offer a glimpse of what's to come in the second half of the collection. By the time we get to disc two, the band is smokin' with the instrumental tour-de-force \\"Hot'lanta\\" and the relentless 23-minute concert staple \\"Whipping Post\\" which leads directly into the monumental 33-minute \\"Mountain Jam\\". As mentioned above, the Deluxe Edition does not present a complete concert but the way it's sequenced creates the illusion that the band were warming up at the beginning just to pull out all the stops at the end. Honestly, by the end of this edition, they certainly do.<br /><br />The sound quality of the Deluxe Edition is amazing with an extra added crack to the drums and bite to the guitars. The packaging is pretty impressive as well with several great photos of the band onstage and some brief but insightful liner notes from music critic Dave Thompson.<br /><br />Whether or not the Deluxe Edition of The Allman Brothers at the Fillmore East is definitive over the original album is a matter of opinion and preference. However, one cannot deny that regardless of which edition you buy, there is some flawless and amazing music here no matter what.itars.

0974872407|5.0|An amazing book! Compelling, gripping and above all the best love story ever (by saying so I mean, that it is not cheesy, overy sweet but just very life-like). Although the boy is in his early ages, I love the fact how he and his personality grow throughout the novel and the different aspect that he develops. It is also a very contemporary book, although it happens in a very dark period of Spanish history. All in all I can only recommend this book. You will find this book like that good sweet chocolate cookie you like so much and is always gone too fast, well this time you can savour it for a looooong time :)
B00008BRBG|4.0|This was the sound of a brash young band born from a musical scene that they had a very marginal tie to. Andy Summers and Stewart Copeland had already done time in other groups (Copeland was a prog-rocker with Curved Air!) and Sting came from an academic background. The story goes that they cut their hair spiky and dyed themselves blond to tape a TV commercial for gum...all while working on \\"Roxanne.\\" So when that punky slice of pop began to chart, the image of The Police as punks was almost accidental.<br /><br />Never-the-less, \\"Outlandos D'Amour\\" was aggressive in a way that future Police albums were not. \\"Next To You,\\" \\"So Lonely\\" and \\"Can't Stand Losing You\\" were big on attitude, which fans of the burgeoning punk scene fed right into. \\"Truth Hits Everybody\\" and \\"Next To You\\" had the kicking tempos that made you just want to jump. The band's three piece set-up with a minimum of additives (maybe a keyboard in \\"Hole In My Life\\" and some multi-tracked backing vocals) kept things crisp and clean. The remastering brings that into bright relief on this re-issue, and reminds us just how startlingly new this all sounded back in 1978.<br /><br />However, like most new bands, all the kinks were not worked through. The silly \\"Sally/Be My Girl\\" grew tired after a few listens back then and hasn't added any charm with age. \\"Masoko Tango\\" just sounds like a jam that was tacked on to the record to increase the running time. But you do hear the elements that eventually grew into brilliance...the reggae touches that made \\"So Lonely\\" and \\"Roxanne\\" so infectious, Summers' mad guitar in \\"Peanuts\\" and Sting's ace songwriting skills. The band still had a sense of humor about themsleves at this moment - just listen to the flub that remained at the beginning of \\"Roxanne.\\" In fact, delete \\"Sally\\" and you could make a strong case for \\"Outlandos D'Amour\\" as a five star album (much the same way that \\"Mother\\" is a blight on the otherwise brilliant \\"Synchronicity\\"). A debut that brimmed over with the excitement of things to come, The Police also never rocked this hard again.ent of things to come, The Police also never rocked this hard again.

B000MXPE7O|4.0|Director:  Robert De Niro <br />Cast:  Matt Damon, Angelina Jolie, Alec Baldwin, Tammy Blanchard, Billy Crudup, Robert De Niro, Keir Dullea, Michael Gamdon, William Hurt, Timothy Dutton. <br />Running Time:  167 minutes <br />Rated R violence, some sexuality, and language. <br /> <br />A gray winter day was a fitting time to see one of the first public screenings of a film called \\"The Good Shepherd,\\" whose chilly hero Edward Wilson (Matt Damon, in a role modeled in part on CIA founder, James Jesus Angleton) is not so much all things to all men as nobody to anybody. A composite figure in a portrait of the birth, rise, and moral shriveling of the American CIA, Matt Damon's disturbingly shut-down Wilson would be one of recent film's most tragic figures if he were not such a hollow, unappealing man. Directing a long-contemplated project using a screenplay by Eric Roth (who penned \\"Munich\\"), Robert De Niro has forged a \\"Godfather\\" of Yankee spy-craft, a heavy, solemn epic about betrayal and loyalty in the world of espionage and counter-espionage dominated not by Italians as in the original \\"Godfather,\\" though Coppola produced, De Niro directed, and Joe Pesci has one of the liveliest on screen moments, but by uptight, stony, patrician WASPs.  Indeed as seen here the world of American intelligence is a privileged and exclusive and deeply conflicted one where Irish, blacks, and Italians need not apply; fathers are absent; privilege grows out of Skull and Bones at Yale, wives are betrayed; sons labor desperately to measure up, and the leading practitioners are ridden with guilt and suspicion. There is no one to trust and nothing to believe in - not family or tradition, or even music - only America, which Edward Wilson says belongs to his class. All others are just visiting. <br /> <br />Into this demoralizing story, damning in its picture of the world of white privilege and of intelligence itself but nonetheless intricately involving and at times genuinely disturbing, are woven some of the major incidents and personalities of the period from from before the Second World War - after which OSS morphed into CIA-- till after the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion under JFK, from hot war to cold war. You have Philbys and fake Russian turncoats, CIA execs siphoning off money to Switzerland in guise of chocolate boxes, and through it all you have a Cuba mole investigation that smashes Wilson's own family.  Wilson's true penchant was for a deaf girl named Laura (an excellent Tammy Blanchard); and with her is the only time Damon seems to develop human warmth. He is forced to marry the more elevated Margaret Russell (an uncomfortable Angelina Jolie) sister of one of his Skull and Bones colleagues who remains Wilson's Old Boy link to privilege ever after. Traumatic embarrassment, revelation of closest held secrets, and doubt of loyalty are seen as inborn elements of the espionage world. The very qualities that make a good spy, as seen here, also make a man untrustworthy. <br /> <br />Do spies ever have fun? Not much, as seen from the angle of Damon's character. Dr. Fredericks (Michael Gambon), a randy gay pseudo-intellectual who turns and turns again, is naughty, but he pays for it. Another Brit, Arch Cummings, played gamely by Billy Crudup, similarly wears a smile that turns to dust. A good professional of the lower ranks like Staff Sergeant Brocco (John Turturro), Wilson's OSS assistant in England, is a stern sadist whose use of LSD for an interrogation backfires fatally. Nasty sabotages are devised to spoil the left's Latin American agricultural schemes. Big foul-ups like the Bay of Pigs invasion lead to vicious internal purges. And through it all Wilson's son cringes and his wife pines; the marriage had dried up after his six-year absence during WWII; and his imploded selfhood is symbolized by his only hobby, building ships inside bottles. As the film bluntly puts it, the spy-master must choose either family or country; he can't have both. And is it all worth it? The Russian on LSD declares his country's armed might a myth perpetuated by America to justify its ongoing pursuit of world dominance. Is intelligence a needed quantity, or are its organizations self-perpetuating shams? The movie never gives a positive answer. This may be the cruelest picture of the spy game ever put on film.  Many fine actors play small unappealing roles as spy-masters or cold operatives. These include De Niro himself, Alec Baldwin, and William Hurt, all creditable, but unlikely to get Oscar nods for their tightly held back performances. Damon can be accused of the same limitation, though if his Wilson bothers you, he's done his job better than you may think. And young Eddie Redmayne, as Wilson's grown son, has one of the most gut-wrenching roles in a story notable for its devastating picture of the effects of career on family life.  Despite its epic scale and length (it's 160 minutes long), \\"The Good Shepherd\\" is more troubling than flashy, more thought-provoking than moving. Ultimately it may be somewhat an artistic failure. The criticism that it is either too long or too short, that it needed to be pared down or expanded to a mini-series, has some merit. But nonetheless as a work that considers big issues and asks big questions, it's one of the more serious and intellectually stimulating mainstream American films of the year.

B000002LAB|5.0|This first release for Warner Bros. was supposed to be a collaboration with Prince. Instead, it was a reuniting with Marcus Miller for this outstanding tribute to Archbishop Desmund Tutu which captured a 1987 Grammy Award.<br /><br />Miles had previously taken part in Artists United Against Apartheid and this CD finds him putting his complete artistic signature in the criticism of the institutionalized white racism in South Africa.<br /><br />The majority of the compositions, arrangements, production and instruments were provided by Miller. George Duke wrote, arranged, co-produced and played on Backyard Ritual. Programmed synthesizers - from Jason Miles - samples and drum loops are the studio tools that dominate the mix.<br /><br />The last track, Full Nelson, is a Miller composition named for Nelson Mandela. The title track sets the stage for arguably the strongest work by Miles in the 1980s. There is not a weak cut as the studio is used to its full potential to merge technology with the trumpet; which hadn't been done since the 1970s funk classic, On The Corner.<br /><br />Miles had left Columbia Records for a variety of artistic issues and one major personal situation. The breaking point was when a company executive contacted Miles and asked him to call Columbia artist Wynton Marsalis and wish him a happy birthday. Miles and Marsalis had a contentious relationship due to harsh comments Marsalis had previously directed at Miles.<br /><br />Unlike many of his critics within the industry, Miles refused to fall back on an antiquated style and simply crank out generic music. Tutu and the subsequent concerts demonstrated that Miles continued to look ahead and refused to wait for others to catch up.

All the known clashes behind the scenes are forgotten in the very first tunes of the opening \\"Two of us\\" (a great song of friendship), and from there it is pure pleasure. My favorite songs are \\"Dig a pony\\" and \\"Let it be\\". Everyone has that phase when only Lennon counts and Paul is regarded as a poet for 12 year old girls. Fortunately, life is long enough to see days when you come across \\"Let it be\\", the song, in your headphones while having an afternoon jog. When the song is over you just mumble \\"Thank you, thank you...\\".

0393061434|3.0|I'm a big fan of Woz, actually I'm a big fan of all those early PC pioneers...thanks to those guys I have a job today. When I saw his story was coming out, I immediately picked up the book, curious to hear in his own words how it all happened. <br /> <br />Unfortnately, the first few chapters are little more than Woz telling us just how unbelievably great he is, at pretty-much everything.  And again...and..again.  Every new page documents some math award he achieved at the age of 4, or some prank he pulled using technology that NASA didn't even have, or about some incredibly advanced science fair project he put together.  You know, while other kids were making Models of the solar system out of Styrofoam Balls and Pipe Cleaners, Woz was designing Logic Gates and a Time Machine and so on.    <br /> <br />Ok, so admittedly he does mention that he's not trying to be conceited, but just proud of his accomplishments.  Thats fine, nothing wrong with that, but it just goes on..and on..and on..and on.  While his achievements are intersting to hear about, after awhile you start to wonder what you're actually hoping to find out about.  He spends a disproportionate amount of time on his early youth accomplishments.   <br /> <br />I also agree with the other reviewers, while the book does follow the general timeline of his life, it could have used some serious editing.  I guess when Woz openly admits he has trouble with shyness, it translates into print...without an endless listing of his accomplishments, there might be alot more empty space filling the pages. <br /> <br />Once you are past the halfway point it gets a little more interesting, with discussions focusing on his Apple and US Festival days among other accomplishments, and his post-Apple days. <br /> <br />Overall, its an enjoyable read.....I enjoyed his discussion of his \\"not quite inside the law\\" phreaking days and generally getting an insight into who he is and the life he's lived.   <br /> <br /> <br />
B000006045|5.0|I can say without reservation and any shadow of a doubt that Massive Attack's absolute classic 'Mezzanine' is one of the best albums I have ever heard. I have a vast and varied music collection consisting of over 1500 albums ranging from 60's psychedelic classics (Blue Cheer & Hendrix), Krautrock masterpieces (Can), Hip Hop perfection (Illmatic, Takes a Nation of Millions), timeless Metal (Black Sabbath), all manner of musical oddity (John Zorn, Coil, Butthole Surfers), and everything in between. From My Bloody Valentine to Sonic Youth to Brian Eno to the Stooges to the Beastie Boys, I have delved deeply and seriously into the World of Music. That being said, 'Mezzanine' is undoubtedly one of the finest albums I have ever heard...<br /><br />It is dark, sensual, timeless, cohesive, and dreamy.  Each track flows perfectly into the next one, creating a delicous aura of Sonic perfection.  This album gets better with age, never growing old. I have listened to it literally 100's of times in various states of consciousness and it never disappoints. I find myself going back to this masterpiece probably more than any other album I own. It is perfect for the night time...<br /><br />There is no need for me to give you a track by track run down. This album cries out to be listened to in an entire sitting, track by track... The momentum grows and this album takes you places that no other album possibly could. There is perhaps one mis-step on this slice of Sonic perfection ('Man Next Door'). That aside, this is a piece of absolute Sonic perfection...<br /><br />To label this album trip hop or electronica is to belittle it. It is really a rock album, so seductively and perfectly recorded that is has morphed into something unique, and all together it's own. You may not realize how perfect it is upon first listen, but with subsequent listens, it will gradually sink in... You need this... By listen number 100, you will begin to realize how deftly and expertly crafted this Sonic Voodoo really is....

0743289412|3.0|With over two hundred reviews, I'm going to stay away from the plot.  But, just so you know where I'm coming from, I've been reading Stephen King's fiction for thirty years.  I'm a \\"long-time reader.\\"  When I first heard about Lisey's Story, I grew excited, thinking that it would be along the lines of Delores Claiborne or Rose Madder.  When I finally got the book at the beginning of December, I immediately started it with great anticipation.  I only managed, however, to make it through thirty pages before tossing the damn thing to the other end of the couch in total frustration.  I don't mind a few colloquialisms scattered throughout a novel, but Lisey's Story is literally buried in them.  As so many other reviewers have remarked, the colloquialisms become somewhat irritating after a while.  They're kind of sweet at first, but then you begin to grind your teeth with each one that pops up. I wanted to have a hard discussion with King's editor.  Anyway, it took me over two months to pick the novel back up.  As Lisey would say, \\"I had to strap it on!\\"  That's the only way to put.  I had to force myself to finish it.  A novel should be fun to read, not a chore that reminds you of visiting the dentist.  Well, it took me eight days to read Lisey's Story.  I will say that the last half of the novel is much better than the first.  The best scenes in the book are the ones that deal with Scott Landon's childhood.  It was like the return of the old Stephen King when reading the parts that dealt with Scott as a ten-year old and his older brother, Paul, and their violently abusive father.  These are the parts that truly terrify you, and this is what made the book for me.  The only problem is that you have to struggle through a lot of excess writing to get to these scenes.  Though I never thought I'd be saying this, at least a hundred pages could've easily been cut from the book.  So, if you haven't read Lisey's Story, but are thinking about it, keep in mind that the best is at the end and that you have to put some real effort into getting there.  And, if I ever read or hear the word \\"Bool\\" again, I'm going to hit somebody in the back of the head with my copy of Lisey's Story, instead of with a silver shovel.he end and that you have to put some real effort into getting there.

B00005OAIE|5.0|I've purchased several of John's CDs and this is without a doubt the very best.  I wanted to hear someone that sounded more like the American's I knew in the 60s and 70s: nonconformists, independent minded and imaginatively descriptive. My favorite songs are Neon and Great Indoors which both describe people I knew and loved. <br />Take away these songs and the rest of the album is incredible.  I don't have to say he's an incredible artist (that's a given)... it's just the entire scene couldn't be contrived... I think it's what he really saw. Just super happening... man!!!!
B000002J09|5.0|All the accolades are deserved! This is the greatest rock album of all time and only seems to get better with the passage of every year since its release in 1971. 8 tracks ranging from riff bashing mania to gentle lush tones. The ebb and flow of emotions are expertly marionetted by the likes of producer Jimmy Page. The album begins with \\"Black Dog\\" which showcases all 4 members at the height of their power. Based on a killer John Paul Jones riff the song begins with Robert Plant's vocal soaring above the clouds and ends with, for my money, Jimmy Page's greatest guitar solo (also ranked this by none other than John Paul Jones- and he oughta know!) In the midst there's honey drippin vocals, frenzied time changes and muscled up drum beats and cymbal crashes. (the true beauty of John Bonham being the ability to know when to lay back just as much as when to hit a listener over the head).  \\"Rock and Roll\\" comes next and for any other band this would open a record. Only the mighty Zeppelin could hold this song till second on an album, confident it would still pack the punch and together with Black Dog create the greatest one-two combination in rock history.   Realizing this aural assault was too frenzied the band pulled back into the Lord of The Rings inspired \\"The Battle of Evermore\\". A folksy change in gears with Plant trading vocals with Sandy Denny from Fairport Convention. It's a bit dated but i still find it interesting as the mood created can still transport the listener above the clouds, envisioning a Middle Earth long before the Peter Jackson movie confirmed it.  The centerpiece of the record is next with the illustrious \\"Stairway To Heaven\\". Yes it's overplayed but if you can remove yourself from classic rock radio for a period, listen to other things and go back to it you will realize it's the greatest Rock 'n' Roll song of all time. At 8 minutes long it's a perfect meld of two moods and styles. The acoustic, recorder inspired intro(featuring some of Page's greatest writing) gives way to a crescendo of thunderous Bonham and double neck guitar virtuosity from Page. Plant's scream at the end still produces a chill on the back of the neck even after the millionth listen.  Side 2(for you youngsters albums used to be divided into 2 sides unlike the straight run through of Cd's) begins with Misty Mountain Hop. A song that gives off the feeling of the musicians having a lot of fun. Hippie lyrics about dancing in the park aside the guitar riff is great, Jones doubles on killer bass and keyboard. The snare roll by Bonham near the end is another phenomenal hair raising moment on this record.  \\"Four Sticks\\" comes next from somewhere in deep left field. A massive metal guitar riff is offset by a bizarre drum beeat literally played by Bonham with four sticks. The chorus(if you can even call it that) seems taken from an entirely different song yet somehow it all pulls together and works. An often forgotten hidden gem on this record.  \\"Going To California\\" seemed like it would have been more in place on Zeppelin III but again the timing is perfect to slow the listener down for a deep breath. \\"To ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn\\" is great Plant lyrical imagery and Page and Jones strum some beautiful acoustics and mandolins. The album closes with the most sampled drum sound ever on \\"When The Levee Breaks\\". Bonham's deft hands and thunder foot accentuate this bluesy romp. Plant's overlooked harmonica playing sparkles as well(even being recorded backwards for added effect). Page and Jones motor through some fine blues and slide their way to crashing finale. Play it loud. Sure I'm biased. I've owned this album since i was ten and it only gets better and deeper with age. There never was anything better and i doubt there ever will be.
0765315246|3.0|Upon finishing it, I did wonder how this book became a Hugo Award finalist. <br /> <br />While the book makes for a fun read over the course of a couple of sittings, it is indescribably unsatisfying.  The story is sweet tasting but without any complex flavors.  Character and story development are pretty run-of-the-mill here.  <br /> <br />Old Man's War was good enough that I'll want to read the next story, Ghost Brigade.  But it's not good enough to warrant a purchase on Amazon.  Public library here I come. <br />
1582701709|1.0|has found it's way to the best seller lists.  Im guessing the only \\"secret\\" worth uncovering here is why so many of us are compelled to abandon simple scientific reasoning for instant \\"feel good\\" philosophies? <br /> <br />I find that the lack of healthy skepticism concerning this book (and others like it, remember Castanadas \\"real\\" interactions with Don Juan) on this Amazon board to be one of the more troubling and tangible problems of our modern world. <br /> <br />Sagan had it right when he called Science a candle in the dark.  <br /> <br />It seems that flame is growing smaller every day.
1400064287|5.0|This is the best book about communications I've read since I discovered Stephen Denning's work on telling business stories.  I highly recommend Made to Stick to all those who want to get their messages across in business more effectively.<br /><br />Imagine if people remembered what you had to say and acted on it.  Wouldn't that be great?  What if people not only remembered and acted, but told hundreds of others who also acted and told? Now you're really getting somewhere!<br /><br />Brothers Chip (an educational consultant and publisher) and Dan (a professor of organizational behavior at Stanford Business School) Heath combine to develop Malcolm Gladwell's point about \\"stickiness\\" in The Tipping Point.  To help you understand what they have in mind, the book opens with the hoary urban tale of the man who ends up in a bathtub packed with ice missing his kidney after accepting a drink from a beautiful woman.  That story, while untrue, has virtually universal awareness.  Many other untrue stories do, too, especially those about what someone found in a fast food meal.<br /><br />The brothers Heath put memorable and quickly forgotten information side-by-side to make the case for six factors (in combination) making the difference between what's memorable and what isn't.  The six factors are:<br /><br />1. Simplicity (any idea over one is too many)<br /><br />2. Unexpectedness (a surprise grabs our attention)<br /><br />3. Concreteness (the more dimensions of details the more hooks our minds use to create a memory)<br /><br />4. Credibility (even untrue stories don't stick unless there's a hint of truth, such as beware of what's too good to be true in the urban legend that opens the book)<br /><br />5. Incite Emotions in Listeners (we remember emotional experiences much more than anything else; we care more about individuals than groups; and we care about things that reflect our identities)<br /><br />6. Combine Messages in Stories (information is more memorable and meaningful in a story form . . . like the urban legend that opens the book)<br /><br />Before commenting on the book further, I have a confession to make.  This book has special meaning for me.  I was one of the first people to employ and popularize the term \\"Maximize Shareholder Value\\" by making that the title of my consulting firm's annual report (Mitchell and Company) over 25 years ago when we began our practice in stock-price improvement.  That term has become almost ubiquitous in CEO and CFO suites, but hasn't gone very far beyond the discussions of corporate leaders, investment bankers and institutional investors and analysts.<br /><br />The authors use that term in the book as an example of a communication that hasn't stuck broadly.  And they are right.  Having watched that term over the years go into all kinds of unexpected places and be quoted by people who had no idea how to do it long ago convinced me of the wisdom of telling people what to do . . . not just what the objective is.<br /><br />The authors make this point beautifully in citing Southwest Airline's goal of being \\"THE low-fare airline.\\" If something conflicts with being a good low-fare airline at Southwest, it's obvious to everybody not to do it.<br /><br />You'll probably find that some of the examples and lessons strike you right in the middle of the forehead, too.  That's good.  That's how we learn.  I went back to a new manuscript I'm writing now and wrote a whole new beginning to better reflect the lessons in Made to Stick.  I've also recommended the book already to about a dozen of my graduate business students.  So clearly Made to Stick is sticking with me.<br /><br />If you find yourself skipping rapidly through the book, be sure to slow down and pay attention on pages 247-249 where the authors take common communications problems and recommend what to do about them (such as how to get people to pay attention to your message).  That's the most valuable part of the book.  It integrates the individual points very effectively and succinctly.<br /><br />I also liked the reference guide on pages 252-257 that outlines the book's contents.  You won't need to take notes with this reference guide in place.<br /><br />So why should you pay attention?  The authors demonstrate with an exercise that people who know and use these principles are more successful in communicating through advertisements than those who are talented in making advertisements but don't know these principles.  Without more such experiments, it's hard to know how broad the principle is . . . but I'm willing to assume that they have a point here.<br /><br />No book is perfect: How could this one have been even better?  Unlike Stephen Denning's wonderful books on storytelling, this book is more about the principles than how to apply the principles.  I hope the authors will come back with many how-to books and workbooks.<br /><br />I would also like to commend the book's cover designer for doing such a good job of simulating a piece of duct tape on the dust jacket.  That feature adds to the stickiness of this book.oints very effectively and succinctly. <br /> <br />I also liked the reference guide on pages 252-257 that outlines the book's contents.

B000093BDX|5.0|This CD is all you need to have of the Beach Boys, unless you want to work through all the many phases of the group.  It is an excellent compilation of their very best hits, spanning about 30 years.  Great gift to a hard-core fan of the Beach Boys, or a casual fan.  This music needs to be in every car because it can always brighten your mood.  Just good, clean fun, demonstrating the Beach Boys' unique sound.  Enjoy!
B0001L3LUE|5.0|...at best, given the US current occupation, this film sheds light on how personal views of the politicians we elect truly influence policy aside from the views of the people.  There are alot of lessons that can be taken from that administration and applied to the current one.  Keep in mind, this film was made PRIOR to the 2nd Iraq war, so yes, it is not just a lot of left wing propaganda.  Note repeated mistakes....
B000002IZM|5.0|A great selection for all Vangelis and Blade Runner fans. I've been trying to dig out my old cassette version to compare the playlists, but have not yet reached the proper depth. One might want to do that to ensure that they will be ordering the product they remember from the past.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Though the magic is all CGI most of it is based on illusions performed in the period.  The story was fun. The acting was great. The costuming, etc was fabulous.
B000002NJS|5.0|The single Ray of Light is absolutely one of the best songs of Madonna's career.  At the time this cd was made it seemed more like a novelty - songs all done on a pc - and I really didn't expect to find any good songs.  So it was a big surprise to be blown away by the title track.<br /><br />The rest of the cd is not as good unfortunately but that doesn't mean this isn't a five star effort.  This is a career changing or career making release and Madonna makes the most of it.<br /><br />Highly recommended just to find out what all the fuss is about.

B0006GAO5Y|4.0|This is one of the rare movies that could have stood well on its  own, but ended up being just the 1st chapter. Generally speaking, I don't like Hollywood heroes. But this is one exception. it works because Rocky is human and real. (Granted, a great deal of the credit certainly belongs to Director John Avildsen who has a real talent for artistic beauty and realism. I consider him 2nd only to Franco Zeffirelli and John Badham.)<br /><br />Moving on, this story focuses on a down on his luck everyman (Rocky). the opening scene is effective as Rocky takes part in a brutal club boxing match. he gets injured for $65. and right away, we see that he actually only gets $43. (due to club fees) We later learn that he works as an enforcer for a loan shark named Tony Gazzo. Rocky reveals his human side when he violates Gazzo's orders, and refuses to break a very scared late payer's thumb.<br /><br />Moving on, Rocky has is eyes on his friend Paul's sister Adrian. It is interesting that instead of showing herself to be the beautiful woman she is, Talia Shire makes Adrian look almost geeky. This works in making the human Rocky attracted to a less than perfect woman. She is notably reluctant and shy, and rocky wins her affection by being kind to her. (Not using wicked seduction techniques that Hollywood often glorifies.) the scene where he takes her skating and tells her about himself is a scene of artistic beauty<br /><br />Later, the current boxing champ (Apollo Creed) runs into some hard luck. His big fight has been called off because the top contender has medical problems. Rather than calling everything off, the clever Apollo Creed decides to give an unknown a chance. (Guess who gets it!) While this movie leads us into cheering for Rocky, we really have no reason to dislike Apollo.<br /><br />Moving on, trainer Mickey didn't really like rocky because he chose to work for Loan Shark Tony Gazzo. But they put their differecnes aside, and Mickey trains Rocky hoping to keep him away from dirty parts of the business. It is interesting that as the movie goes on, Rocky's former  boss Tony Gazzo starts to show some redeeming qualities. (Perhaps John Avildsen was trying to show that good will can be contagious!)<br /><br />After some beautifully filmed training sequences, Rocky realizes that while he will certainly make the most of his chance, it's unrealistic to think he can beat Apollo. But that's alright. While we live in a society and age that doesn't look well on 2nd best, Rocky points out that winning is not important. What IS important is doing your best. Adults often teach it to children, but don't seem to believe it themselves!<br /><br />The final fight between Apollo and Rocky is done surprisingly and artfully well without being overly brutal. If you like this movie, the sequels are for the most part impressive. 2 picks up where 1 left off and is one of my favorites; 3 gives us a surprisingly well done story in that Rocky wins the approval of the former champ; I didn't much like 4, but it does have the theme of technology vs the human spirit; 5 focuses on deception and remains one of my favorites. I understand 5 was not so popular, but then Rocky realized the importance of going the distance against the odds, so against my odds, I'll hold to my view that 5 is one of the best.ness.

B000002ADT|5.0|Everything Michael Connelly wrote about this album, played in Bosch's cliffside home, is true.  Beautiful music.
B000006U44|5.0|Although Kate had a hit in the US with \\"The Man With A Child In His Eyes\\", this album went un-noticed upon its release in the late 70's in the states, while it blew up over-seas, making her a sensation in the UK. <br /> <br />Discovered and nurtured by Pink Floyd, you definitely get a kind of \\"trippy\\" influence with this album. Kate's vocals are unique and compliment the misty piano and sometimes dark orchestrations quite well. This definitely and album that is meant to be listened to straight through and each song is easy to appreciate. <br /> <br />The ultimate highlight is, of course, her signature song \\"Wuthering Heights.\\" I definitely prefer this original version to the 1985 re-cut she did. Her girly, yearning vocals in the chorus are striking against the music *although it reaks of that 70's influence...just listen to that bass.* The opening track \\"Moving\\" is also incredible and the perfect opening....\\"You crush the lily in my soooooul...\\" You also have the sweet piano ballad \\"The Man With a Child In His Eyes\\" that introduced Kate to the states *just listen to that french horn!*. \\"Them Heavy People\\" sounds like something straight out of a quirky musical, but that isn't a bad thing. I want to dance every time I hear it. My other favorite has to be the title track which offers the perfect closing. <br /> <br />Don't just buy it for these songs I have highlighted, though. This is truly one of those rare albums where every track has something to offer and easily one of the top choices in my collection. If you are a fan of Tori Amos, check this out!
B000B8QEYC|5.0|Although Amarantine is similar to her previous CDs in style and format, Amarantine is another excellent piece of work from Enya.  Enya \\"still has it\\" in the sense that her voice is still very beautiful, but her music on this album is repetitious to her previous CDs. I would definitely call this CD an Easy Listening CD.  All tracks are beautiful and well done, although you find yourself saying, \\"Haven't I heard this before\\".  Amarantine will be listened to many times, if you are an Enya fan, and enjoyed evertime.  I like every track on Amarantine and I recommend the CD to every Enya Fan, but don't expect anything new.
B000IFQLLY|2.0|I'm not sure when it started, but in the day when DM released an album they came out with ONE single and they had a limited amount of \\"best of\\" albums.  Now they have twenty throw away remixes of one song and put it on two cd at a premium price.  And best of cds like this are worthless.  I bought it taking a chance.  Sure the new song is worth a listen, but I believe that the band lowers themselves with every best of series.  I mean, who is going to buy this?  Don't they have enough of my money after 25 years? <br /> <br />They again, this might not have been the bands idea. <br /> <br />Sorry to be so negative.
B000H305U0|5.0|I didn't really expect to like this CD. I had a rental car while my car was repaired that only had radio (which I never listen to) and heard \\"Sexy Back\\". That sparked my interest. I checked out CD from library and am purchasing it now.<br /><br />I love the funk, beats, lyrics - the whole shabang. And I aint a kid anymore!
B000M341QE|2.0|This is an entertaining movie but nothing new. I felt like there were two different movies going on at the same time. DiCaprio's and Damon's performances are almost over-rought compared to Nicholson's goofy, almost slapstick one which is distracting at times. Alec Baldwin is over the top as well and everyone sounds like a bad Kennedy impersonator. It makes more sense when you understand that the movie is based on a Hong Kong exploitation film but that \\"dumbing down\\" of the American form is not something this viewer welcomes. The plot is a simple reworking of that movie \\"Face Off\\" from a few years ago. Everything and everyone is a blast of machismo and bravado which is ultimately funny because Damon's character turns out to be a \\"closeted\\" homosexual. There is always the ever present Scorcese signature quick cuts and slo-mo with The Rolling Stones music in the background. As always there is lots of ironic violence and reaction to violence. I don't mind the homage to the silent era of using the opening diaphragm on Damon the \\"rat\\" linked to the closing on the real rat but it's funny reading some people's reviews on how they don't understand nor appreciate such simple devices. I think it is time for Marty to move on or perhaps a Russian mob movie? No thanks. Watch this movie twice and you will wonder why you did.

B00000251N|5.0|What can be said without sounding redundant of the other reviewers here?  Even if you are not a Neil Diamond fan (who isn't?) you will enjoy this CD.  Neil Diamond's music never sounds dated even years later when listened to.   <br /> <br />Every song on this relaxing CD is well done.

Amazing how organizing your home can help you \\"declutter\\" your mind as well!
B000F1IQNM|5.0|I was looking at some of the other reviews. A \\"yes\\" for kids up to about 12 or 13. I as a much older person like it for some of the phrases. \\"Lord love a duck\\" said by the priest. Then through out the film \\" I did Knock.\\" Kind of a Bewitched of a kind.
B000LC55F2|5.0|I've read the other reviews just to see what they said. I happen to think this was a great film. <br />The story was strong and convincing as well as the acting. The sets and costumes were fantastic. <br />The story here was not the sleight of hand or illusion, but the competition. How far would anyone go to seek revenge? And just how would that revenge effect the one seeking it? <br />Truly an original story here filled with mystery, doubt, revenge and the illusions that surround us. All the players are in fine form here. Each one fleshes out their character quite well and play into the common theme dynamically. <br />If you like a good mystery that is tense and driven, then this is the film for you. A rare trip as of late as most mysteries have to be gore or flesh driven. But not this one. All Hitchcock and DePalma fans will love this one.

There was a book written a long time ago that preaches a message of wealth and popularity, of miraculous healings and a fulfilled life.  People of this age with all their \\"education\\" have belittled this notion and this book and have called it antiquated and ridiculous, a crutch of modern man. <br />Perhaps each of you should read it first. <br />It's called the the Holy Bible.

You get a first hand account of the respective cultures.  Worse yet, you get a feeling of the repression women and girls suffer at the hands of Islam. <br /> <br />    She does not flinch from the truth -- despite the legions of fanatics that now want to kill her.  You owe it to her to read this book, and you owe it to yourself. <br /> <br />    The book leads to true comprehension of the evil we will all have to face.  Don't taking the life journey she has so eloquently laid out!  Don't pass up the chance for an understanding of a very closed culture with a tour guide that has lived it. <br /> <br />Mark

As I read this popular book (I had to wait for weeks to get it from my library), I mocked the flowery language and overdone emotionalism. But I didn't put the book down--and as soon as I was finished, I went out and bought another Jody Picoult book. Her endings are incredible. Flowery or not, this is a good read.
B000ASATZ8|4.0|This is a really good product, especially for the price. It's a good idea for sci-fi fans. When I got mine, one of the discs was defective, but returning it was no big deal. The second movie is definetly the best, then the first, then the third. The fourth one isn't something I'd pay money for, but it's okay in a box set.

Gallup has streamlined the book to serve more like a small manual for people taking the online instrument, without the other data and commentary present in \\"Now, Discover Your Strengths\\". They have wisely put the codes in an enclosed envelope to prevent \\"code stealing\\". The book is also linked to a new version of their website that contains improved interpretation resources and personalized reports. (There are even options for what type of \\"certificate\\" you want to print out. Fancy)  <br /> <br />The book also includes small stickers for each of the 34 talent themes so you can stick your \\"top 5\\" on its glossy red and white cover for a convenient reminder. Cute to some, essential for others. Buying the book is still the only way to take the online instrument, but now it's more affordable and streamlined. Let the Strengths Revolution continue!
141694740X|2.0|This might be a good book if you're confused about why that guy you met 2 weeks ago hasn't called you like he said he would, or why your crush doesn't ever look your way...  But this is NOT a book I'd recommend reading after you've been dumped by a guy and you're completely heartbroken.  While it might give you a reality-check in other situations, it actually made me feel worse about the breakup, because it basically told me how much my ex-boyfriend doesn't want me and won't ever speak to me again.  It might be the truth, but it's not what a girl wants to hear after being dumped!  For the brokenhearted women out there, choose \\"It's Called a Breakup Because It's Broken\\" (Behrendt) instead - MUCH better advice that makes you feel good about yourself and the situation at hand.
1401302378|5.0|I hate reading business books. Boring!! Rarely any new info or ideas that a clear thinker couldn't figure out themselves. Not this one. Clearly written, a bit repetitive (otherwise wouldn't be long enough to publish), but genuinely thought-provoking and original. Helped me shape some ideas I had in new and better ways. Outstanding!
B0000029AP|5.0|This by far my favorite Aerosmith CD. They were at their zenith at this time.  Every cut was a gem and a true rock classic cd and belongs in any worth while classic rock collection.
1572814349|4.0|I purchased this deck based mostly on the reviews I read here.  The cards are rather good quality.  The gold edges haven't flaked or chipped after 100's of shuffles.  The paper is thick.  The card art itself is a nice matte finish, and hasn't rubbed or chaffed away.<br /><br />I only have a few minor complaints.  The cards are large, the deck is heavy, and it can be abrasive to shuffle (the edges, not corners, are sharp).  The book is small, and doesn't open well, and the information within is not as comprehensive as I would like.<br /><br />Fortunately there's 1000's of alternative sources for information.<br /><br />For what I paid, this deck is a steal.  Easily my favorite tarot deck at this time.
B00006AVRK|5.0|Hugh Laurie is, for my money, the finest actor now working.  His Greg House has made him a public reputation, but the Jeeves and Wooster series, in which he played P.G. Wodehouse's Bertie Wooster to Stephen Fry's Jeeves, was his first triumph.  Laurie was fresh out of Cambridge and evidently didn't realize that comedy is much harder to play than tragedy.  These stories are a stitch, and Laurie (and his friend Stephen Fry)display talent of the highest order. <br /> <br />This set is a must for the sophisticated viewer who spends far too much time vainly searching the channel listings for something worth watching. <br /> <br />Watch them, watch them again and again; and, when you write your will, leave them to your favorite child. <br /> <br />
B000E5N62U|5.0|As a lifelong \\"Dan\\" enthusiast, I anxiously await anything new from them or DF. Have everything, but must admit, my thrill goes up and down from album to album. Never too low and sometimes way up high. This one is way up high. I can't stop listening to it. From the first song (title song) to the last (hey, the same song) I am engaged and enthralled. Lyrics are fascinating, as always, but the music... that music... oh that music! Way to go!!
B000002JSJ|5.0|Why this cd gets four star rating is beyond me.  The cd rocks from top to bottom.  The first full-blown electric Led Zeppelin recording just chills me to the bones.  I cranked up Hots On For Nowhere one time so loud I could not hear right for a week afterwards.  This cd is way under-rated in my opinion and I bought it the first day it hit the shelves and has been my second favorit LZ album since followed by Physical Graffiti.
B000KX0IOK|5.0|Ryan Gosling gives an off-the-charts, startling, emotionally charged performance as Dan Dunne, a young and unhappy man who is disenchanted with the world and himself. <br /> <br />The camera follows every emotion that surfaces in Dan's mind and face and soul; we watch him spend every waking moment pondering life and its intricate hypocrisies, intolerance, and continuous disappointments, we watch him spend every waking moment pondering his own personal failings and let-downs, we watch him spend every waking moment trying to escape his anguish through drug abuse, and we watch him spend every waking moment mentally and physically punishing himself for his failings by engaging in drug abuse. <br /> <br />In addition to the abuse of drugs, his emotional decline is accelerated by his career as a history teacher (and coach) in an inner-city run-down school where a few, if any, students graduate highschool, let alone advance to college. We readily discern that he has given up all attempts at trying to reach out and inspire his students to fight against the injustices and misinformation that exist in the world. <br /> <br />His mental anguish and desolation and severe alienation, melded with rampant drug use, has nearly destroyed him. <br /> <br />His only hope of survival is being inspired by one of his own students, Drey - whom he has made an incongruous connection with - to save himself. <br /> <br />As Drey (Shareeka Epps) struggles to accept Dan's failings - in the hope that a friendship with him will help both of them overcome their circumstances - she unwittingly leads Dan further down the path of self-destruction, which can only end with a clarifying moment of salvation or untimely death... <br /> <br />Half Nelson is a masterpiece film, emotionally purgative, hypnotically realistic, and soul-shattering; its depiction of people who only experience fleeting moments of happiness in a retrogressive, bleak world is so realistic that it is visually and spiritually and emotionally earth-shattering.  <br />
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|I liked this movie well enough. It's a good version to watch if you're not looking for something terribly deep and like the book, but I would much sooner recommend the '95 BBC/A&E version, with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. There is too much Hollywood in this version; too much is changed from Jane Austen's original wonderful book. For one thing, the scene in which Mr. Darcy first proposes takes place outside in the rain. That is much too cliched for my taste. And it is just an example of the many rather sickening modernizations in this version. <br />It is not wholly unenjoyable. But it pales in comparison with the previously mentioned '95 version. Compared to the portrayal of the characters in that version, Elizabeth and Darcy and all the rest in this one are a bit shallow, and the original story has been rather disfigured and twisted in an attempt to make it more appealing to the masses (it doesn't work). And the chemistry in this one is not bad, but nothing to that between Firth and Ehle's Darcy and Elizabeth. I say, rent this, watch it, and then go out and buy the '95 version for real enjoyment.
B000002UA5|4.0|Ummagumma takes us on a journey to every corner of the proverbial Pink Floyd map. Even throughout the opening tunes of Sysyphus parts One, Two, Three and Four we are taken through the gamut of foreboding tribal drums, a meandering piano piece, violent and arhythmic metallic hammerings and finally through to a calmed and serene plateau that is typical of Floyd's more relaxed work. <br /> <br />Despite this immensely diverse intro, what follows is possibly the most eclectic grouping of songs to appear on a single Floyd album. Grantchester Meadows will chill the listener into an almost comatose state, as will the beautifully rendered 'The Grand Vizier's Garden Party' parts 1 and 3. <br /> <br />This is not to say however that the entirety of 'Ummagumma' is simply a relaxed 'Floyd on prozac' effort, far from it. One merely has to look at the song title 'Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving With a Pict' to know that you are in for something out of the ordinary. The result is a bizarre, but somehow rhythmic collection of squeaks, howls and animal noises that add to the surreal nature of this album. 'The Narrow Way' is a more conventional rock tune that is similar to some earlier Floyd such as 'Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun'. However like the vast majority of this album it is lyric free. <br /> <br />Although 'Ummagumma' is certainly not among Pink Floyd's more celebrated works, it is, in my opinion, among their best. It is as wide ranging as they come and will surely be part of the collection of any true Floydian.
B000002J1U|5.0|This album always put me in tune with Zep.  It made you feel you were in the room when they recorded it and you was a part of it.  <br /> <br />To Bon-Yr-Aur  <br /> <br />Thanks Led Zeppelin!
B000K7UBTI|1.0|Well, after Ultimate Avengers 2 I kinda figured Iron Man would be pretty bad. But I didn't realize how bad.<br /><br />I am assuming Mavel thinks the comic book fans will just buy whatever they release.<br /><br />With cartoons like Justice League, I was pretty shocked that they would give the green light for a story this bad.<br /><br />When it comes to comics, make mine Marvel, when it comes to cartoons, DC is the way to go.
B00005MP58|5.0|Myself, my mom, my sister and my dad have watched this movie together several times now, and we still love it just as much as the first time we watched it, if not more. One aspect that I love especially is that the writer(s) did not get pulled into the false belief that they needed to change Jane Austen's words in order to make it good (as seen in the 2005 version). This version is amazingly like the book, which is a big part of what makes it so enjoyable.  <br />Another is the acting. Colin Firth is the best Mr. Darcy I have ever seen, and Jennifer Ehle plays Elizabeth extremely well. They both capture Austen's characters exactly. I have to admit that I don't know the names of most of the other actors... But I can't think of one that is not perfectly suited to their part. Also (as my mom always constantly comments on throughout the movie...), the music is wonderfully composed, and the cinematography is absolutely beautiful. <br />I can't say enough how great this film is! I highly recommend it. We watched this version a few days after seeing the newer one, and unanimously agreed that this version is waaaaaaaay better. It captures Austen's book so well... It's amusing, and, of course, wonderfully romantic (don't let that scare you off if you're not a chick flick kind of person - my dad usually isn't but he really enjoyed this film). It's one of my very favorite movies! I could watch it over and over and never get bored. In response to an earlier review, I didn't notice any problems with the color and saturation. And true, this is not the most special of special editions, but you definitely don't need special features to make this version the best Pride And Prejudice I have ever seen! PLEASE WATCH IT. You will not be sorry.
0140283587|5.0|I loved this book. I first read it in India because my travel partner was laughing so hard while reading it. Don't expect high-brow literature here, but if you have ever been to that part of the world, Dave's experiences and Sutcliffe's descriptions of them are dead-on. It will take you back! The book truely captures the low-budget backpacker's experience in India, mainly by pointing out how absurd situations and people can be. Sutcliffe's writing is astute and very funny, and Dave is likeable because his observations are honest and wry, exposing many pretentious and superficial stereotypes for what they are. I highly recommend this book, particularly if you have traveled in south-east asia (if not, you may not find it as funny). It's been circulating among the travelers used books stores over there for years (for good reason).
B0000029AL|5.0|This is one of the finest debut albums I have heard and it was my first Aerosmith album.  I wore grooves in it and love the guitar play in it and it is my third favorite Aerosmith cd (after Toys and Rocks).  It also is worth while to have around in your collections.
0307276902|3.0|I was about half way through James Frey's quote-unquote memoir when he was outed on national television and I have to admit that initially I was quite angry with the culprit (a certain wealthy celebrity whom I respect very much) for spoiling the end of the book.  That's not to say I don't feel she had an ethical obligation to protect her name and her reputation for standing up for the truth and so her decision was completely justified and one I respect.  Still, at the time I was pretty upset.  Since then though I have finished Frey's life story (said with sarcasm) and I now will attempt reviewing it with as much neutralism as possible.<br /><br />It's common knowledge at this point that James Frey is a fraud and that his memoir is nothing more than an attempt to land on the best seller list.  That's not to say that his story is completely false and or moot, but it's clear as day that he really wanted this to blow everyone away, no matter how fictitious his life become.  His writing style is amateur but, admittedly so, very engrossing.  His story, his life as he claims, is intriguing but Frey should have known that many fractions of his novel are too far fetched to ever be considered true.  If this book had been published as a work of fiction and not a true accounting of ones life experience then I would be more apropos to dish out deserved praise, but there are a few pet peeves I have with Frey's embellished account.<br /><br />The main problem I have with Frey is his attitude.  Like I said, if this were a mere work of fiction then his attitude wouldn't be a problem, but the fact that he sports this as truth and claims this his road to redemption and or recovery his attitude becomes all the more important.  As some reviewers have already mentioned, Frey claims that his stubborn, \\"refuse help and just learn to deal on your own\\" type of persona cured him but is that really the message you want someone who is really struggling with addiction to believe in.  Like I said, if this were truth and it really did work for him then more power to him and I support him BUT since he's even admitted to layers of falsities within his book then I feel he's done a very selfish and damaging thing in claiming the system DOESN'T work.<br /><br />I feel torn about this novel as a whole because there were moments, even after hearing it was a sham, that I felt connected and even emotional towards the cast of characters and their situations.  There are certain chapters that will keep your eyes glued to the page, and while, as some have mentioned, James does repeat himself an awful lot, he still manages to keep us entertained.  I really wish he had just marketed this as a novel and not a memoir.  That way I could really love it.<br /><br />For those of you who are debating whether or not to even give this a try know that it can be at times rewarding.  It just all depends on how you look at it, how far you're willing to read into things.  If you pick this up as pure entertainment with no real merit then this should be fulfilling, but if you insist on reading into this mans claims as true testament then I suggest you not even bother picking this up.  James Frey will never again reach the best seller list for his reputation has been tarnished beyond compare (the queen has spoken, he is a nobody now) but this novel is still here for those of us who are willing to give it a try.  It's not ALL bad.said, if this were truth and it really did work for him then more power to him and I support him BUT since he's even admitted to layers of falsities within his book then I feel he's done a very selfish and damaging thing in claiming the system DOESN'T work. <br /> <br />I feel torn about this novel as a whole because there were moments, even after hearing it was a sham, that I felt connected and even emotional towards the cast of characters and their situations.

1400079179|5.0|\\"I am Robert Langdon, and I have just uncovered the biggest conspiracy of all time.\\" Robert Langdon has been pulled into a conspiracy that traces back the biblical times. He and a French cryptologist, Sophie, have found themselves tangled up in a mystery that could change the world. Confused but curious, the two of them follow clues to uncovering the secret.<br /><br /> The DaVinci Code is an action/adventure novel with a lot of mystery. It is part of the Robert Langdon series, which includes Angels and Demons, Deception Point, and Digital Fortress. This is the best book that I have ever read and I couldn't put it down. It has to do with religion, secrecy, and mystery to name a few themes.<br /><br /> The DaVinci Code is for young adults and older readers. Dan Brown is a great writer and will make you want to read more of his books after The DaVinci Code. If you want a book that will keep you thinking, The DaVinci Code is definitely for you.<br /><br />-Matt Gigliotti
B000H30B2C|5.0|Cinematography is just classic Jackson.  It's very beautiful to watch.  It's slow at times though.  I'm glad the high action happened soon in the film.  I loved the stampede & T-Rex scenes although some of it seemed waaaaay too impossible.  Like, why would THREE different t-rexes go after one single chic when there are several other creatures to comsume?  Why would the first t-rex chase after her after it just ate the other dinosaur?  Anyway, we won't get into technical survival tactics cuz that will just make me sound like a discovery channel/animal planet addict.<br /><br />Some hated the scene where Jane & Kong are scooting around on the frozen lake but I loved it.  I thought it was a very nice quiet moment amidst the chaotic police chase.  I still loved it.  I don't care if it was overrated (which I admit it really was).
B000002J09|5.0|You know it is good when it is so good you cannot even give a title to it.  This is my third favorite LZ cd and I spent a lot of good hours listening to this cd in my lifetime.  It was my favortie LZ until Physical Graffiti came out, followed by Presence.
B00004RF9G|3.0|Not one of the better made movies.  Dated.  Gene Kelley was even disappointed that he couldn't film on location.  The story and plot are a bit dated, but the music is beautiful.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I loved The first Evanescence CD Fallen and was a little worried that the second CD wouldn't live up to my hopes and expectations despite \\"Call me when You're Sober\\" was playing on the radio constantly. I knew I liked that one song...but how would the others hold up??  <br /> <br />I got my answer shortly after purchasing it...very well, actually! <br /> <br />Amy Lee has the voice of an angel and has grown tremendously since her band's first release. If she had to use the pain in her life as her muse, then so be it! I'm a firm beleiver in \\"What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger\\" and she and her band have the muscle to prove it! <br /> <br />There is not a single disappointing track on this CD! It was money well spent and I'll be looking forward to any future releases from this band!
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Such a sweet love story.  I loved the twist.  I loved the drama.  I know they're suppose to be in Vienna but the acting would have been so much better w/out the accents **or** if they did a better job at studying Italian accents.  Rufus was great, as usual, as the villan.  The inspector BRILLIANT as Paul normally is.  It doesn't matter if the man is in a comedic or serious film he never fails to impress me.  Jessica, eye candy but I always judge her acting as just...very good.  Edward, wonderfull as usual.  So yeah - I could care less about the accents, other than it gave me a giggle here & there.  The film still rocked.
B000002JSN|5.0|I love this this cd and it has been my favorite studio recording of all times and by far the best rock album ever put out...bar none.  I have owned this cd many times over and if I could have just one cd to have for the rest of my life it would be this one or two since it is a double cd.    \\"Should we roll it Jimmy?\\"
B000JJRIN4|3.0|Gwen Stefani has never had a powerhouse voice. She's no Whitney Houston, or Mariah Carey, or Celine Dion, or Christina Aguilera. In fact she's more so a Britney Spears, who has more of a pop voice. But this doesn't give Gwen the right to literally talk on her some of her tracks. The lead-off single/track, \\"Wind It Up\\", gets only as good as a playable song for dance clubs, but thats it. Her attempts to \\"yodel\\" in the beginning are terrifying. Her vocals are astonishingly bad. She's not even singing, more like talking. Her second track/single \\"The Sweet Escape\\" does a much better job and covers up the negativity of Wind It Up. With a swing feel to the song, it's fun and enjoyable, and shows the cheery side of her. However, Akon's \\"wooo-hooo, eee-hooo\\" could be done without. Orange County Girl...its intriguing the first time you listen to it, but afterwards it just makes you wanna skip it each time you go through the CD. Her fourth song is perhaps the best song on the album. \\"Early Winter\\" describes a woman's heartbreak on how unfaithful/hurting her man is. Like I've said, even though Gwen doesn't have a belting voice, she uses her average voice extremely well on this track. This power ballad is reminiscence of No Doubt's \\"Don't Speak\\". Her next 3 songs have its peaks and valleys. Now That You Got It is trying to be a \\"Hollaback Girl Part 2\\", but it definitely isn't as catchy or as exciting. 4 in the Morning is shows gwen at another attempt for somethign more sensible, and she almost makes it work. The next track, Yummy, has her crooning like she's 20 years younger. Its not even crooning. Its a \\"Wind It Up 2nd Part\\", except even worse. She goes back to her \\"talking\\" formula that doesn't work at all. Gwen, those songs are for 19 year olds, not 39 year olds. And even 19 year olds shouldn't consider singing (excuse me, talking) on such an over-the-top song. Her next 4 tracks sort of slow the album down, and it does little to enhance the album. Her last track, however, does a nice job of closing it. Wonderful Life is the second best track on the album, and makes up for the slack the previous 4 left. All in all, it introduced a different sound than her \\"Love.Angel.Music.Baby.\\" debut, but it still shows some inexperience and holes here and there as she now attempts to put \\"rap\\" under her category.
0743454537|5.0|This book is gripping right up to the end.  Jodi Piccoult strings the reader along and plays with his/her emotions and then *bam* it ends.  She leaves you wanting more.  She is a genius.  Her characters are so real.  The reader can imagine themselves living along side the characters and seeing the other side of the coin.  She tackels controversial issues with finesse and grace.  This book is worth reading over and over again!
B000002JSR|5.0|Better than most rock groups at their zenith. I really, really like this cd a lot.  Especially the version in the Complete Studio Recordings.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|Being a classic rock diehard fan for years this piece bought back great memories.Jack Bruce voice is still mystical,Eric Clapton in his usual cool palying and offcourse Ginger Baker who at this age can still pound.Great act, pity i was not there but seeing and hearing on this dvd was great enuf.
B000002J03|5.0|First of All; Every cd by Led Zeppelin are 5-star cds in one way or another in my humble opinion.  Of all the monster studio recordings this one is the least played of all my Zep cds.  I just never got the chill I got from the others, but this is still solid rock.

B000E41MS6|2.0|The first about three episodes are absolute arse and should be called the Billi Piper show, but they get better as they go along with some cool story lines and great costumes
B000IOM0YM|5.0|I received the bonus DVD from Madison Square Garden in New York and the energy from that show was incredible!  I just wish it had contained the entire concert.  Does anyone know why it was not available or shown?<br /><br />Obviously, the video and audio quality wasn't the best, but it is better to have and to see this show than to miss out on it.  Just contrast the energy difference between the New York and Houston shows - there is a huge difference, especially with Ace Frehley - he is really on his best game in New York!<br /><br />I haven't reviewed the rest of the DVD, only because I just finished watching the Houston and New York shows, but these DVDs are some of the best music DVDs I have ever seen and I have seen and own a whole lot.  Thank goodness they were filmed in the 70's.  Can you imagine if they were filmed today?  It would be nothing but MTV-style editing with less than 2 seconds between cuts.  Here you can see the glory of Kiss and feel like you were there, even if that would have been impossible.  Fantastic!  100 stars!
B000K7VHQE|5.0|Okay, so if you're going into this movie with the idea that it's a hysterical comedy with a cute little girl, then yes, you will be disappointed.  I, on the other hand saw this movie knowing absolutely nothing about it and it now sits at the top of my movie favorites.  The humor is very similar to that of \\"Garden State\\", so if you enjoyed Zach Braff and his hysterical dark humor, \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" should hit you pretty well.  I think the humor sits well with college-aged people...I know several people in college or just out of college that really enjoyed it and others a bit older who didn't quite enjoy the story of a dysfunctional family in a volkswagon bus.
B000JLTRIG|4.0|This is not the best season of Charmed, but I preferred it to season 5 and 6, which I thought were a little on the boring side. That may be because I prefer the darker story lines and here we had a revival of some of the darker themes of the Charmed mythology.<br /><br />I enjoyed watching Leo's inner conflict with the elders, his grappling with his inner deamons, namely anger and revenge, and the chasing of the dream of a world without the good and evil polarity. Great to see him and the sisters eventually realize that the tensions between good and evil is linked to free will and that a world without free will, however peaceful on the surface, is actually worst than the ills the utopian dream proclaimed to cure.<br /><br />The episodes after the dismantelling of Utopia and the leaving of the avatars were not particularly riveting and could have been better. The story itself was good: the demonic world with a new leader attempts to take hold of the Nexus and Book of shadows, almost defeating the Charmed ones for good. These could have been great episodes if the leader of the underworld had been a bit more convincing. This chief deamon however did not have much of an edge...nothing compared to the charisma we encountered say in the first Source or even better in the Cole/Baltazar deamon of season 4. I have missed Cole since season 4, he was such a great character, which, by the way, makes a short guest appearance in \\"the seventh year witch\\" episode in this season.<br /><br />All in all however, this was a good season and I had fun watching it...and the twist at the end is pretty neat(which I will not reveal, just in case you have not watched it yet, as it would spoil your fun). I am looking forward to see how the last season will be played out given this last development.
B000HT386M|3.0|I liked Bulletproof, Happy Gilmore, Little Nicky, and every other simple minded picture that Adam Sandler created. He has strayed from the world of stoner comedy and is trying to win our hearts, he must be stopped. I am not implying that this film does not have a good premise, nor am I saying that it does not have potential, but I am saying that it has heart.  <br />The picture is about an overworked architect named Michael Newman that cannot get a hold of his life. Whatever Michael does, it ends up making someone upset and it usually ends up being his hot wife and two children. Newman becomes frustrated that his life is not perfect, even though he has a nice house, a good job and a loving family. He gets angry because his neighbor has everything that he dreams of, and when Newman gets close his neighbor just gets more useless crap. One of these things is a universal remote control that takes care of all household uses, instead of using multiple remotes for the garage, television, and remote control cars. Newman goes to Bed Bath and Beyond and in a campy attempt at a joke there is a section called way beyond that has a scientist named Morty in it played by Christopher Walken. The rest of the plot goes without saying if you have even glanced at the previews.  <br />The first thirty to forty five minutes are pretty funny. Sandler is his usual obnoxious humorous self making fun of small children and desperate housewives. The jokes in the beginning are non stop up, until the comedy turns into a drama and they try to pull the strings on our hearts. The jokes become few and far between and not many of them hit after a while. The end is predictable and heartwarming. <br /> One thing I thought was interesting; the name of the nasty next door neighbor boy is O'Doyle. If you take a second and put on your thinking cap you will remember this is the red headed group of bullies in Billy Madison.  <br />
B000E8NQUE|4.0|Despite being previously disappointed with the Question of Balance SACD I plunged forward with this one. I must say I like this one much better. I haven't really experienced the ear fatigue other reviewers have noted though there is no doubt that the reproduction here does have a more compressed sound and differs significantly from other versions such as the MFSL CD which I also have.  <br /> <br />In this case I think different is actually better. I really enjoy the surround sound seperation on this one much more than The Question of Balance. Clarity is the key word here. I've never heard this CD sound so pristine. Having enjoyed this CD in other releases (and previously LP) for many years I appreciate the opportunity to hear it in a vastly different light.  <br /> <br />The Intro to Lovely To See You just jumps out the speakers. Much more in your face than I've ever heard before. Other rocking tunes really benefit from the SACD sound as well. I noticed some of the songs are longer than the originals with introductions and endings expanded to what I presume was their full size. This alters the listening experience if you're comparing to the original, but I don't mind this as anyone buying and listening to this SACD should be someone interested in exploring this CD at a different level.  <br /> <br />As for the weaknesses? Lack of bass response is once again the most significant limitation. There is no subwoofer channel as there wasn't on the Question of Balance either. I believe this comes from the fact these SACD mixes were created from the quadrophonic 4 channel mixes. Overall, for Moody Blues fanatics wishing to dig deeper into this brilliant record I do recommend it. The bonus tracks are interesting though not essential. Once again my Sony SACD player cannot play these bonus tracks which are not mixed in SACD. The player (as others have noted) considers the end of the SACD formatted songs as the end of the CD!  <br /> <br />For more casual fans the remastered version from the late 90's should suffice. Because of the limitations discussed above I can't give it a 5 star though on content alone I think it would be. Is it the definitive, perfect reproduction of this Moody Blues masterpiece? I believe the answer is no. That said, its still an enjoyable variation on a great record. <br /> <br />
B0001I561E|4.0|This DVD arrived in a timely manner and in good condition. I am glad to be able to find things like this online that I otherwise could not.
006092988X|5.0|This book is a beautiful story in so many ways - the strong, complex characters, and the history of a legendary part of the United States being just two of them. The world through the main character's eyes is a world seen anew. The reader truly can feel raw intensity of early 20th century Brooklyn, the challenge and joy of immigrant communities living together. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for an enriching and enchanting story.
B000LE1FAY|5.0|I have always been a huge Belinda Carlisle fan right from the Go Go's days.  I own all her solo cds and don't dislike any songs of hers at all.  When I heard that a new cd was finally done I was estatic.  When I heard that it was all in French, I was a little disappointed.  When I actually heard the cd for myself - I was nothing short of impressed. <br />This is a fantastic cd that you HAVE to listen to whether you are a fan or not.  If you are a fan, don't be put off by the change of pace for Belinda - it's an amazing cd and she suits it very well.  Her vocals are as classy as ever and the song choices are superb.  I love all tracks almost equally, but to me, the absolute standout song is La Vie en Rose (you'll know it when you hear it).  If you can get this cd with the bonus english tracks then all the better, but you'll love this cd regardless. <br />While it is a very different pace from her, it's terrific and fresh and I cannot stop playing it in my iPod.  I truly enjoy it and while I can't wait for a new english cd, this doesn't disappoint at all.  It's great.
0679882820|5.0|We love this book. The text is fun to read. My 11 month-old likes being able to easily turn the pages. Plus I don't have to worry about him tearing the pages apart.
1932100660|5.0|The China Study is an extremely well-researched yet very readable recommendation for addressing what constitutes good nutrition.  This excellent book includes a description of Dr. Campbell's personal journey, the critical role nutrition plays in the prevention of most disease and what profit motivated industries have done to convince the public to subscribe to unhealthy eating habits.  This book is a must read for the sake of your health and the health of your children.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|I really don't see why people are giving this cd poor reviews. Some are saying it's snooze music? Oh really? If you want a rock album try Led Zeppelin or Lil' Richard. Some are saying it's depressing? Go get your pill bottle refilled, because it aint the album... The album is beatiful. Norah has written some very good songs here. It has more of an intimate feel to me than her other albums, because you really get to envelope into more personal sincere lyrics. Her voice as always is it's own, and the instrumentation is sparse for the most part and never overdone. I bought the deluxe edition and got the dvd with it showing that she is no studio fix. Meaning that her voice and tone, along with instrumentation, are as good as you hear on this album.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|Nearly thirty years old and still one of the best live albums ever recorded. Schenker is almost note perfect and the reason why i've been a fan of the classic \\"line up\\" all these years. It's also cheaper now than on vinyl in '78! No justice!! <br />
1577314808|5.0|I was in awe of this book.  I read it twice in two weeks.  For me, it truly resonated.  I got what he was saying loud & clear.  What a great concept Eckhart Tolle has shared with us all.  I truly believe it is a life changing book.  With an open mind, these concepts can work for anyone.  I really get that all of my pain is created in the past & in my projection of the future.  Once I was able to see and feel that, I have been so much more at peace.
B00003OO3O|5.0|How can you not give this five stars? This is great guitar orientated rock even though Andy Parker's cymbals sound awful. I have never tired of playing this album for over thirty years and it is still one of my favourites. There are five classic songs that the band still perform live. \\"Let it Roll\\" and \\"Shoot Shoot\\" are great heavy rock standards and \\"Mother Mary\\" and \\"This Kid's\\" are two of the many highlights on the \\"Strangers\\" live album. Add to this the wonderful \\"Out in the Street\\" and you can forgive the dated production. The whole thing comes packaged up in another magic cover by Hipgnosis for less than a fiver (English pounds folks!) What joy!
B000063V8U|5.0|for all the trek fans, this has all the episodes without the commericals.
B000H305U0|4.0|I set to dispise this album cuz JT is too mainstream and trendy. I still think it's most fluff, but after one listen, I'm completley hooked. Makes you want to dance and sing along.
1582701709|4.0|After reading \\"The Secret\\" and watching the DVD, I was delighted to see \\"The Secret\\" discussed on the Oprah Show this past week.  However, I was impressed to see how her guests, many of whom were part of the making of the film, agreed that merely knowing the secret of the law of attraction is not enough. <br />Although I have been aware of and successfully used this law myself for many years, as a counselor working with others, I know there is much more than merely changing one's mind to create new thoughts, emotions and actions to gain positive results.  I employ and recommend \\"Anatomy of Success\\" by Ronald Kaufman to move people through belief change and establish a successful self-concept that allows them to manifest according to the law of attraction - it picks up where \\"The Secret\\" leaves off. <br />
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Listening to Corinne brought back the feeling when I first heard Norah Jones' debut album. Refreshing and catchy, gentlely hook you in. And I think Corinne a bit edger than Norah too, and she wrote all the songs too. She should have won Best New Artist Grammy.
0785814531|5.0|I've always had a liking for Edgar Allan Poe, with his tales of horror, mystery and suspense, done in the atmospheric prose of a master writer. Since I live close enough, I've even made some trips to his gravesite, a place that is always surrounded by a sense of sadness.<br /><br />Poe was a tormented genius who died young, under mysterious circumstances, and at the time of his death he wasn't deservingly popular. Certainly his work was not cute romances for the masses -- he explored the darkness of the human heart, love, satire, and the earliest whodunnit stories. And \\"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe\\" brings together all of his poetry and writings in one book.<br /><br />Poe's fiction writings include short stories and novellas, which tend to be rather weird -- a treasure-hunt and a golden insect, a ship caught in a whirlpool, a hypnotized man talks about the universe, and stories of despair, madness, and occasionally beauty. There is also his trilogy of Monsieur C. Auguste Dupin stories, which were the first to feature a brilliant detective solving an impossible crime.<br /><br />Most people know about \\"The Raven\\" (which even has the Baltimore Ravens named after it) but Poe actually wrote a lot of poetry, most of which readers never heard of. Sometimes dark, or whimsical, or even both. \\"By a route obscure and lonely/Haunted by ill angels only/Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT/On a black throne reigns upright...\\"<br /><br />And, of course, the horror. This is what Poe is best known for, including such well-known stories as \\"The Fall Of The House Of Usher.\\" But there are also lesser-known gems -- tales of a plague invading a party, being buried alive, a portrait that siphoned the life out of its subject, and a nightly visit to an Italian crypt leading to madness.<br /><br />Don't read \\"Complete Stories and Poems\\" all at once. It's too intense. It's better to soak it in a little at a time, so that you can get a better feel for the different kinds of writing that Poe did, and how he excelled at pretty much everything he put down on paper. Most great writers can't boast of that much.<br /><br />Poe's writing is what makes even his least story or poem come alive -- he brought a gothic, misty vibrancy to his stories, and could make his quiet dialogue seem utterly chilling (\\" \\"I have no name in the regions which I inhabit. I was mortal, but am fiend...\\"). It's not hard to see why he was an influence on authors such as Fyodor Dostoevsky, Oscar Wilde, Arthur Conan Doyle and Franz Kafka.<br /><br />\\"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe\\" is a must-have for anyone with an appreciation for great literature and beautiful, dark writing.inds of writing that Poe did, and how he excelled at pretty much everything he put down on paper.

B000KCHZK6|2.0|well, that's all I can say. Norah sounds nice, soothing as usuall, but she doesn't sound refreshing or that musically creative or anything. If this album were her debut, it definitely won't be a breakout for her or anybody. But it's Norah, if you are a fan, 10 bucks is really nothing, just to hear her soothing voice. Otherwise, there are lots better albums worthy of your money. Like Amy Winehouse, Corrine Bailey Ray, or Robin Thicke, Paolo Nutini, James Morrison.
B000M4RG42|3.0|I tend to measure war movies against the incredible HBO Series Band of Brothers. I know that's basically unfair as no movie has the luxury of time given to a mini-series to develop characters and situations. However, a great movie CAN develop characters in a short two hours, make its point and stick in our memories.<br /><br />As many prior posters have noted, this movie was a disappointment. I too found the flashback style worked against the film. There was no tension created, and that had the effect of keeping the audience at arm's length from the characters. A clearer narrative style might have helped.<br /><br />After the gore of SPR and Band of Brothers, the carnage in this film was quite mild, surprisingly so. That's not Clint's fault, but I felt the battle scenes were a bit gratuitous. The great war movies always find a place to show a soldier's disillusionment ON the battlefield. Here, the disillusions were all kept to the dog-n-pony road show.<br /><br />To me, the movie rang a bit hollow, both on and off the battlefield. To be honest, I feel there's more realism and truth to be found in some of the great episodes from the old Combat! series on TV.<br /><br />Still worth seeing, but I can see why it wasn't given a nomination for best picture.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|Really great. Some wonderful reviews here have already said most of how I feel about this album. One of 2006 top 10 albums. Mayer not only shows him growth as a musician, he actually excels in this album. The best one from Mayber so far. Impressive, impressive, impressive. And refreshed my love for blues music again.
B000BB1MIC|5.0|I love, love LOVE The Gilmore Girls. Its quirky, silly, amusing and fun... but underlying all of the revelry are some stark truths about mother-daughter relationships. <br /> <br />I can relate very much to Lorelai, who never quite managed to do things her parents approved of. Many of her interactions with Emily leaving me snorting with mirth. Unfortunately, I can also relate to her 'unlucky in love' status. <br /> <br />Why oh WHY won't the writers let her be married, and stay married to someone wonderful? Like Luke? He was/is perfect for her... Sigh...
B0002W4SWC|5.0|It came fast and have no complaints about the dvd itself.  Its an awesome movie!!
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I have a small apt. and two cats...  This machine works great; it gets just about all the cat hair off the tiled kitchen floor, and all the cat litter!  It does pick up most stuff off the carpet, but it can't replace a vacuum.  Bottom line, if you hate sweeping then this is the machine for you.  It does a better job then I can with a broom, but takes half the time.  It's light and easy to maneuver around furniture, and even gets under the kitchen table with out me having to move all the chairs.  It has made sweeping the kitchen floor a tortured job of the past.  Do be cautious though, their are specific directions for recharging the batter pack.  If you over charge the battery, it shortens the battery life, so you can't just leave the thing on the charger when you're not using it.  All in all a great buy and worth every cent.
B000A468XY|4.0|Better than average movie with adventure and the usual theme of believe-in-the-magic-of-Christmas. The adventure does have scary moments.<br /><br />This DVD was playing sort of in the background at last year's big holiday multi-day family gathering, with a dozen or so children under 8 years visiting cousins. The movie did not get my undivided attention, therefore, although it did get played multiple times. It did keep kids (and me too) from getting restless during some down times. In future years, I think I will play it again during such visits.<br /><br />One nice surprise was the way the movie pushed beyond stereotypes in a reasonably subtle way.<br /><br />If I remember correctly (the memory is vague now), one of the themes for the child characters was recognizing one's strengths and learning to use them, and appreciating that other individuals have different types of gifts.<br /><br />One of the main characters had the gift of leadership aptitude. As a child, I never gave leadership much thought -- how it works, etc. I'm glad the movie brought it forth, as something of importance. I didn't notice till years later, on the job, the important difference between a boss (or military officer) having the formal title and power to command people, versus a person who can lead -- who can inspire, motivate, and influence others even if he/she lacks a formal title. I don't know whether children viewing this movie will actually notice the subtle message that leadership is an important thing, since there is so much else going on in the movie that is more entertaining. But then again, young kids often watch the same DVD/video many times.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I borrowed a copy from a friend and had to have my own copy.  This is a really cool series.
B000KGGLCU|4.0|I saw the Confessions Tour live in person and thought it was a fantastic show...being that close to Madonna was amazing.  When I heard that she was going to film the show in London and later broadcast it, I was excited because I enjoyed the show so much that I wanted to see it again.  However, I was so disappointed with the editing!  The camera moved way too fast to different angles, visuals were overlapping the actual performance, and certain sequences were shown in slow-motion! <br />  If you're going to call this \\"Live from London\\" it should seem live....as did the Drowned World Tour DVD (a brilliant show...her best I must say).  I also noticed that there is a slight delay between the audio and the visual...it makes it seem like Madonna is not on track with her dance moves...which is absolutely not the case.  I don't know what these editors were thinking.  They should have filmed the show and presented it as live-looking as possible...instead of a glossy, movie-like appearance.  This really took away from the essence of the show.  Also, where is \\"Get Together\\" and \\"Forbidden Love\\" on the CD?  Come on people get it right..! <br /> <br />My favorite moments: \\"Get Together\\" \\"Isaac\\" \\"Erotica/You Thrill Me\\"
B000JIHP88|5.0|I compared reviews on this mobile along with the TinyLove mobile called Symphony in Motion and the Fisher Price Ocean Wonders mobile.  I really like the fact that Symphony in Motion is award winning but the biggest drawback to that one is the fact that it can actually keep babies awake because of how active it is.  And I like the Ocean Wonders mobile because of the ceiling projection but the drawback there is that people said you pretty much have to have the room pitch black dark to see those images well.  Since we keep a night light on for our little one, we decided against that one too.  In the end, we chose the Fisher Price Rainforest mobile because it seemed to be the most soothing and we were NOT disappointed.  She tries hard to stay awake and watch the leaves go and colorful animals go round and round.  But there's something about the slow speed of the rotation along with the jungle noise and/or classical music that just makes her drowsy everytime.  My husband and I are VERY pleased with this purchase.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|I love this show. I caught a few episodes when they ran but I bought a copy of the season and love it.
B000KCHZK6|4.0|This is a strong effort - influences such as Tom Waits & Randy Newman really shine through in the songs.  Numbers like \\"Sinking Soon\\" and \\"My Dear Country\\" show such growth as a writer. And as a singer, she is without fault. If it's not as easy for some folks as \\"Come Away With Me\\" was to get into, it's also far more mature. I knew when I bought that first album she was one to watch. She still is.
B00005JP97|4.0|I didn't know what to expect going in to this one, and I don't really think I can prepare anyone else for the experience.<br /><br />The plot is strange. I won't try to summarize it beyond saying that a bluesman decides to cure a girl of her sex addiction. The trailer does a good job of telling you what it's about.<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of Christina Ricci, but she is amazing in Black Snake Moan. She put a fire into her character that no other actress could have created. According to the Craig Brewer, the director, she actually insisted on using a real chain instead of the rubber prop.<br /><br />Samuel L. Jackson gives exactly the performance you'd expect, which is great but nothing special for him.<br /><br />Craig Brewer's direction is also great. Direction isn't something that I usually comment on, but there were a few standout scenes in this movie that had incredible energy that requires good direction in addition to acting.<br /><br />It's funny and strange and great; I definitely recommend it to anyone who's up for a unique film experience.
B00006GO99|5.0|Monk's most creative period was the mid 40's to early 50's, when he developed his style (revolutionary at the time) and wrote most of his classic compositions.  Sadly he was underappreciated by the public until after that period.  By the time of this recording, 1962, Monk's style has been fully developed for a while.  This record is sometimes dismissed because there is not much innovation or new compositions.  I think that is a mistake.  This is Monk as a mature artist refining his style with a great band.  The sax player, Charlie Rouse, is not a celebrity name like John Coltrane, Sonny Rollins, or Johnny Griffin, but his tone and style perfectly complement Monk on this record.  Monk's opening solo on \\"Sweet and Lovely\\" is one of his best, and when Rouse comes in after a couple of minutes, it's pretty close to perfect.  There's only one new song, \\"Bright Mississippi\\", but it's one of his classics.  When Monk covers standards like \\"Like a Gigolo\\" and \\"Body and Soul\\" he makes them sound like they are his songs.  I highly recommend this one.
B00000IFWE|4.0|It is well-documented that this 1999 Tom Petty offering is based on his divorce.  That alone makes this album an interesting listen.  For sure, the music and lyrics are a bit less upbeat than usual.  Nonetheless, this is still a fantastic album by this legendary band. <br /> <br />\\"Room at the Top\\" is a slower-than-average opening album track and first single, but it is surely a poignant song.  \\"Free Girl Now\\", as others have noted, is vintage rocking Tom Petty.  \\"Swingin'\\" is another exceptionally fun song.  I still remember how the crowd reacted to this one when I saw it in concert during my 1999 honeymoon in Las Vegas....What a treat.  Songs like \\"Accused of Love\\" and the closing track \\"One More Day, One More Night\\" showcase that more mellow side again, but for sure it is a quality mellow side. <br /> <br />Truth is, there are many good to great songs on this album.  I almost can give it 5 stars, but just to distinguish from the very best of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, I'll mark it down half a star.  Still an excellent album that is worthy of purchase.  If you like any Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers albums, chances are you will like this one.
B00005JOLI|3.0|Ok first off I will say this was a good movie I will definitely get it when it comes out on DVD.  But compared to the book it was a little disappointing.  There are things in the book that don't even take place in the movie and visa versa for the movie having things that weren't even in the book, as for Saphira in the book it takes months for her to fully grow and the mental link between her and Eragon to form but it just took like a day in the movie.  No sooner does she start to fly than bam bam bam she is fully grown and can speak with Eragon.  If they had made the movie a little bit longer it could have possibly been better but as it stands it is still a good movie just a little disappointing compared to the book.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|28 songs for a one-CD price?  That in and of itself caught my attention when this album came out last year--never mind that it was the legendary Chili Peppers putting out such an effort.  But do the songs measure up?    In my opinion, they absolutely do.  You can't go wrong with the rock of the huge hit \\"Dani California\\", \\"Especially in Michigan\\", or \\"Readymade\\".  More mellow fare like \\"Desecration Smile\\", \\"Wet Sand\\", and \\"If\\" also hits the spot.  As others have stated, don't believe the folks who try to tell you this album is not catchy; it absolutely is.  While I liked most of the songs right away, repeated listens allowed me to truly observe how brilliant this music is.  Melodic, funky, catchy, rocking, mellow...it all blends together beautifully on these two CDs.    Yes, times have changed since the \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magic\\" days of 15 years ago.  I know that I have changed in the past 15 years...haven't we all (hopefully)?  No doubt the Chili Peppers have.  One thing that hasn't changed, however...their musical output continues to be brilliant.  This album will be looked upon as a classic 15-20 years from now.
0446615625|2.0|I picked this book up to see why people recommended David Baldacci. After reading this book, I'm now even more curious why anyone reads his works. Hopefully, other books by this same author are better than this book which focuses on a group (The Camel Club) that figures out a conspiracy. Yes, the FBI, CIA and other intelligence agencies are all ignorant, but luckily we've got homeless people and \\"former\\" intelligence officers that solve big problems and reveal devious plots. One silly part is the use of tranquilizer darts instead of bullets when the terrorists attack the President. Yeah, right. Okay. Sure.  <br /> <br />The dialogue is sloppy, the various characters are either stereotypical or unbelievable and the book was about 100 pages too long. I struggled to finish the book and when I finished the book I regretted ever starting it in the first place.  <br /> <br />Skip this book. Maybe he's written better books, but I doubt I'll ever risk finding out.
B000J103PC|5.0|I LOVE THE MOVIE IN THE THEATHER. AND IT IS JUST ASFUNMY
B00006LIRI|5.0|THE BEST!!!! My husband & I are so fanatic of this multi-awarded band. Way back when we were still dating, their songs hold a special place in our hearts. Gosh, all their songs are pure & natural. Buying the best of 1990-2000 was the best thing we did that day. We popped it in the CD of our car & we just loved listening to their songs while on the road. I think our 18 month old son will like them too....
0064471837|5.0|This is a fabulous trilogy which I just can not put down. I am now on Abhorsen - the third book of the trilogy - which I began to read in my kitchen as I received it. I just finished the second book last night, and couldn't wait to sink my teeth into this one.<br /><br />My daughter (13 yrs) read the trilogy first and sponged it into her soul.<br /><br />We talk about whether it should be made into a movie... she says \\"no\\", but I am a photographer, so part of me would like to see this in motion.  On the other hand, they would probably ruin it. We did however agree, with a laugh, that perhaps one day we will own a white cat named \\"Mogget\\"! This is the best fantasy - no! Best series - I have read in years! An all absorbing tale that wisks me away to a realm of magic, lore, and adventure.<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />We will be looking for Garth Nix's other books as well as he is a fantastic read!
B000002B30|5.0|Born in the USA!! Yes, we are!!! This CD deserved a 5 star for great music. bruce's voice is so unique, it's what gives the song an upbeat quality. I never thought we can still find one of his CD these days, but thank God Amazon has them. We popped it in the CD of our car & we never grow tired of hearing them over & over again...
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Loved the TV show - too bad it was cancelled. Characters are a blast and the cast is great.
B0009SOFGI|4.0|Overlooked and under sold, I too as a youth might have snubbed this record for its complete lack of artifice, particularly in the era it was released.  Ironically, I am now old enough to appreciate its directness.  I have never laughed as much listening to a record the first time as I did to this unfashionably disaffected (in the 60s) seemingly inane, and insightful Rock n' Roll explosion.  Oh yeh, it's fantastically noisy too!  Opening with the wa-wa guitar licks of \\"1969,\\" I wondered if Iggy Pop (a.k.a. Iggy Stooge) had a time machine.  Who'd have thought that tune (the song culled for single release backed with \\"Real Cool Time\\" and of course a complete flop in that year) would become more and more relevant with each passing decade?  An album of pure adolescent innocence and ferocity, THE STOOGES was accused of being \\"dumb\\" but is in fact a return to rock roots instinctively informed by the passing decade of its release as well as the masters of the 50s.  The record exerted enormous influence despite extremely low sales and inadvertently revitalized Rock in conjunction with just a few other bands (like The MC5.)  This record looks forward in a way these guys could not have foreseen.  \\"I Wanna Be Your Dog\\" is at turns fabulously compelling, revolting, and hilarious, and my own favorite \\"Not Right\\" bares the obsessive motives of youth.  I can see why THE STOOGES are referred to as the proto-punks.  Docked a point for the long theatre piece \\"We Will Fall,\\" which isn't bad, but seems to be a bit filler, the re-mastered release, including a bonus disc, is well worth the price of admission.  You will swiftly move on to The Stooges' second album FUN HOUSE if you truly love Rock n' Roll.
B000059H98|3.0|I ordered two copies of TANK GIRL, and they arrived very early in the arrival date spectrum. My only complaint is that in one copy, the center part of the inside of the DVD was broken, allowing the DVD itself to move freely inside the case. The DVD didn't get damaged, but now the case is trash.
B000089RVX|5.0|The lead singer of this group is angelic.  Her voice compliments the harmonics of the electric guitar and even the violin renditions.  Don't sleep on this group the new style brought by her opera like voice.
B000KCHZK6|1.0|This cd is so bland! Every single song sounds the same. It's almost so bad that you think there is just one continuous 45 minute song! Her voice is not that special either. It's almost like listening to Patsy Cline on downers. She makes Enya sound like a rock star. At least Enya does vary the sound SOME. That album cover makes me cringe. Could she have chosen an uglier frock? The best song isn't that great. She says over and over...It's not tooooo late....ooooohoooooh....it's not to late...for loooove! I think she knows that people will buy this cd no matter how bad it is. She needs to try a little harder and spice it up a little.
B00000K2VZ|2.0|I grew up listening to her \\"In Concert\\" album, and bought the Pearl album based on reviews saying this was a more mature style for her music.  I like her old style better, this sounds like she was trying to make a more pop sound for her music (although the singing wasn't much different).  It not only didn't sound like what you expect from Janice Joplin, it sounded like a muzak imitation of her.
B00006LFGD|5.0|Much of this is not the greatest Steisand, though Streisand almost always is a very great and moving singer. But certain moments here sent a chill down the spine. Hearing Judy Garland 's voice and then Streisand's was such a moment. Arguably the two greatest female ballad singers all time. There was another moment just hearing Sinatra and Streisand together though their collaboration on 'I've got a Crush on you' is far from what each is capable of. I remember the Barry Gibb collaboration and it still has its pleasantness. Her duet with Josh Groban is a nice piece. The opening riff of her duet with Ray Charles is a bit overdone. Barbara is an entertainer who gives it all but here it sounds as if she is schmaltzing it up a bit.<br /><br />On the whole though her quality as a singer prevails here as it does in most of her work.
B00005JPBD|3.0|Penelope Cruz stakes her claim in \\"Volver\\" to be the new Sophia Loren: earthy, ethnic, buxom, and beautiful. Buxom and beautiful she is; ethnic, perhaps; but she misses the mark on earthy. At the beginning of this movie I had the impression that Cruz was high-class Spanish based on her dress and manner.  Later, we learn that she's a washerwoman and cook with a worthless, alcoholic husband. Sorry, Sr. Director.  Cooks/washerwomen don't look that good or dress that well.    <br /> <br />Nor is the movie that good.  It's interesting and intriguing in about the same way as a telenovela is with surprising twists and titillating little revelations -- but the story isn't very credible. The basic story is that Cruz's mother died four years ago on the same day that a friend's mother disappeared.  We work toward a solution to that puzzling coincidence and as the story moves along we learn all manner of startling things about the two families and all manner of startling things happen. I'll give the movie three stars because of Cruz's impressive pechos, good acting by all parties, and a twisty plot.   <br /> <br />Smallchief
B000GCFO12|5.0|this movie stays true to its origins, which was the video game by Konami. amazing monsters, and perfect portrayal of the atmosphere presented in the games. the UMD version of this movie is spectacular. the quality is beyond belief. i literally said \\"wow!\\" when i saw it. sound quality is pretty good too, though one must keep in mind, playing a movie on a handheld can be tricky sound-wise. otherwise, everything is crystal-clear. i seriously suggest getting this movie, whether you're a fan of horror or of Silent Hill. and on your PSP, you can watch this movie in the dark under your covers and it'd be that much more frightening! ;)
B000683VI4|5.0|I've had this movie for a few months already but never really felt like watching it.  The other night, I thought I would give it a try and it was wonderful! It had been a long time I had seen such a romantic movie.  It's on the verge of being cheesy, but it's not, and it's just a wonderful story.<br /><br />I just wish a love story like that could actually happen in real life...
0375831002|5.0|Very good book.  It stays with you.  The use of death as a narrator was original and didn't distract from the story. The characterization was was arranged in an original way also.  I felt for more than just the main character, in fact, I became attached to all the characters.  Superb.
B000M4RG4C|1.0|Having seen all the hype and awards, I was SO excited to rent this DVD.  I am a WWII buff and always appreciate realistic portrayals of war; especially some of the film footage on the History Channel recently released.  This movie stunned me because I was so terribly bored!  I was not drawn to any character whatsoever, including Ira Hayes, and had trouble staying focused.  I watched it with family members who were also bored by the lack of character attachment and empathy.  I understand how other reviewers did not appreciate the utter cynicism that Eastwood portrayed (I am the son of a WWII vet who was in the Pacific in the end) and would agree with them, except I never actually cared enough about the movie's characters to even be bothered by it.  The awards are baffling, unless you factor in political reasons; much like Bob Dylan not even nominated for Album of the Year by the Grammy's...had he made some anti-war statements he might have been honored.  Perhaps Mr. Eastwood will appreciate my cynicism since that appears to have been his main focus.
B000ILYYJE|5.0|... the  concept & presentation of this boxset `Perception' is brilliant.   You open the box: left door ....  right door and in between.... The Doors!   Emotion: .... thrill!  The peephole sublime! <br /> <br />`Perception' is a present from my dearest friends and it's  one of the most precious gifts I ever got. <br />Being passionated by the Doors since the late '70's , I have all their albums (vinyl & cd)  (including  An American Prayer & the two post-Jim-period albums (the latter two only vinyl, of course),  compilations, best of's,  boxset 1997,  many Doors & Jim Morrison books etc. <br /> <br />`Perception' however is .... different and  in my opinion the most harmonious and consistent legacy of The Doors,  Jim Morrison's will.  The sound quality is superior.    <br />Each cd/dvd contains surprises, unknown bits & pieces.  Sometimes it's Jim, sighing, talking, laughing....   Then again you notice a tiny change in vocals, keyboards, drums and/or guitar... <br />Listening to the music and watching the dvd's with all the extra's, you enter  the Doors' World, experiencing their poetic energy & undergoing tidal waves of emotion....  <br />The booklets reveal a treasure of information. <br />This boxset is unique and a must for the Doors' fan!\\"   <br />If I could, I would rate this boxset 6 stars.....
B00011F5DK|5.0|Our 6 year old purchased Blokus for his birthday and we have enjoyed playing it with everyone that visits.  All ages can play and everyone really enjoys it.  We've had 5 years to grandparents playing it and loving it.  We would recommend it for any family game night.  Enjoy!
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I loved Everwood and really miss it! The Season One DVDs really help me to revisit the wonderful moments on the show. It is beautifully done.  I only hope that DVDs Seasons 2,3,and 4 will not be far away! <br /> <br /> <br />
0440238153|5.0|As Lyra and Will's childhoods come to an end, so does this beautiful trilogy.  All promises made by the author in the form of characters and storylines are fulfilled.  Some of those endings are bitersweet, but Pullman does not cheat his readers.  The loose ends are tied up, and that is satisfying.
0307237699|5.0|This an excellent book that should encourage anyone that has a dream or major goals in life.  It urges us to get up and do something.  Believing is supporting.  You don't have to be deep into political issues to enjoy this book and learn from it.  I hope and pray that Representative Obama has much success in or out of the White House.  Hope never fails.

B000EMGAOY|4.0|Anthony, Flea Etc..Your new album is great! However, you guys(along with most other artists), can't be talked to without joining a club. I watched the Grammy performance and enjoyed it throughly. Your comments(Anthony) about people forming rock bands is right on the mark. But Tom Petty, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and John Mayer all won awards in obscure categories that the ACADEMY has decided is not rock 'n' roll. Well, this music was rock when I was growing up. Let's get back to a wider definition of what is rock and start from there. Have you heard the new Mellancamp album? Give \\"props\\" to your elders, not the latest rap \\"sensations\\".

076531178X|5.0|My dear Mr. Sanderson, but you do continue to amaze!  I was one of the foremost to come out and say the hype of \\"Elantris\\" was a bit much and lets not call you the next Tolkien yet (or ever hopefully, the poor man needs his rest what with being reincarnated every time a good fantasy novel comes out) but you do continue to impressed.  Nothing more so than the fact that you improved with your second novel (a surprisingly hard feat) and any doubts about your ability were washed away in the face of this wonderful work.<br /><br />\\"Mistborn: Final Empire\\" does away with every problem I had with \\"Elantris\\".  Your theme was just as plentiful without being obvious, instead using the characters and the plot to get the point across.  Your characters are far from \\"perfect\\" this time, failing, succeeding, thinking the wrong thing, being fooled, and all of the POVs are equally interesting without a weak point among them, leaving that horrible \\"let me look and see how many pages till I get back to that person\\" feeling from appearing.<br /><br />And to this novel itself, what a great story with a truly original magic system that really added to the world and made the Final Empire seem like a living breathing place, with its own rules to be broken and remade.<br /><br />Usually I'd ramble for another four hundred words or so, but I don't feel the need, the other reviews have talked specifics, I just wanted to add my small voice to theirs.  Best of luck on the next volume, Mr. Sanderson.<br /><br />Final Thought:  Buy it.  Especially if it happens to be in paperback by the time you've read this.  Martin, Jordan, and Goodkind (sadly) might hold the heights of fantasy at the moment but five years from now Brandon Sanderson is going to be one of the guys everyone is talking about.
B00003CXB2|5.0|This wonderful classic is worth watching again and again. My sixteen year old son watched it for the first time and was very impressed (a pleasant surprise-since he's not hip on old movies). He thought the film would be so out of date as far as stunts, special effects, etc. that he'd be bored to tears, but this film has stood up to the test of time, perhaps because it was ahead of its time. I never get tired of watching O'Toole's performance as the brash, impressionable young Lawrence who strives to help keep Arabia in the hands of the Arabs, despite the wishes of his British commanders. At one point Lawrence develops a 'God complex', only to be brought back to the reality that he's just and ordinary man with weaknesses. This realization doesn't stop him from attempting to do something extraordinary...<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author

1582701709|1.0|I think new-age philosophy will always be better than Christianity at reselling or redefining themselves into something that can be sold to the public at large. Trouble is, it's pseudo-Christian psycho-nonsense. Perhaps a new-age would think this being an attack, I like to think of this is as a revealing of what truth really is. At this site, you will find what the lie being sold in \\"The Secret\\" is.<br /><br />  The Secret is based on what is called the Laws of Attraction, which is this:<br /><br />  \\"The Law of Attraction is, \\"That which is likened to is drawn\\" or more simply put, \\"Like attracts like.\\" It's all about where you put your attention. When you are focused on what you want, you are attracting what you do want. When you are focused on what you don't want, you are attracting what you do not want.\\"<br /><br />\\"2. The Law Of Deliberate Creation<br /><br />According to the Law of Attraction, anything you focus on you create. The good news is that you can deliberately attract what you want. The Law of Deliberate Creation states, \\"That which you give thought to, believe, allow, or expect - is.\\" The word \\"deliberate\\" emphasizes our intentions. Clarity is essential - clarity of what you do want/choose.\\"<br /><br />  The book claims that it uses physicists in it's talks, but I am pretty certain there are some Laws, not theories in physics that this book is speaking of breaking. First off, the idea of actually creating something. Nothing can be created out of nothing. It's a law of science, I think, widely accepted. I also agree with the writer of Ecclesiastes 1:9 that there is \\"nothing new under the sun.\\" Take websites. Aren't most of them a hybrid of newsletters, bulletin boards, and other forms of media already invented put in a digital space and streamlined for mass consumption? It talks about fulfilling desires through self-motivation, but faith gives us what we need.<br /><br />  I checked out the spiritual adviser on this book. I went to his website and got the overall idea of what it's about. My biggest problem with it is that it says they use the Bible and think of Jesus as a good spiritual and moral leader, but not God. As CS Lewis once pointed out, that is something impossible. They claim to use gnostic and Aramaic versions of the Bible, but even in the majority of those claim some sort of divinity to Him. It's philosophical idiocy to say a man claiming to be God is a good moral teacher if you do not accept His divinity. You can't have it both ways, either Jesus was God, He was nuts for saying so, or He was an agent of evil.<br /><br />  Which goes into my argument of identity being superior to positive thinking. Jesus didn't get His power from thinking happy thoughts like Peter Pan (which essentially is the argument \\"The Secret\\" creates.) He used the Holy Spirit to gain that strength because of who He was already before He had His first thought as a man.<br /><br />  My point is that it is faith, not positive thinking that gets me through the day. There's nothing wrong with having a positive attitude or thinking happy thoughts, but to say that is where our power comes from is ludicrous and gives human beings too much credit. The truth is we are a sinful creation who couldn't do a thing on our own if it were not for God.<br /><br />  I am reminded of the faith of the Centurion in Matthew Chapter 8. Here was a guy in power, who knew what Jesus could do. A follower of the Secret would say it was the Centurion's positive attitude that allowed his servant to be healed. That's a different thing than faith. If it were just a matter of positive thinking, why visit Jesus at all? No, it was faith. The man identified himself as a believer in the power of God manifested in Jesus. That doesn't mean he felt Jesus would heal the servant automatically. According to the Centurion, Jesus had to \\"say the word\\" and it would be done, but he didn't have to. The verse above emphasizes that healing isn't an automatic thing. Faith is a prerequisite and the power of God is the requirement.<br /><br />  I'm sure the authors of the book would think me narrow minded and simplistic for explaining such things, but there is a HUGE difference between faith and the power of positive thinking. Yes, it's good to get yourself into a good mindset before the big game, but what about when you're on the ropes? The major difference between faith and this new age psychobabble is that in faith, we are allowed to cry out to God, demand answers, yell, scream, and cry. We can weep at His feet with our sorrow without the knowledge of there being a brighter day. There is a time for everything under the sun, including dark times and bad thoughts. Faith allows us hope because, even if it gets worse, God is in control.<br /><br />  The biggest problem is what happens when that positive thought goes horribly wrong? We don't have God to blame or to help us with that, it's ours alone to own. We can't call it the will of God, but a lack of positivity on our part. The rug wasn't feng shui enough. Faith lets us put into account the idea that bad things will come into our lives as well as good. Positive thinking puts the blame on us when grandpa dies for thinking about how old he is too much instead of it might just being his time. Faith is not pretty, easy to package, and it isn't endorsed by Oprah either.<br /><br />  I can also share from personal experience that I tried several times gaining employment over the past few weeks without any results while thinking, \\"Today's the day, I find a job,\\" but it wasn't until I put God first by saying I was going back into ministry as well that any doors really opened up in a good way.

0062502182|1.0|I think this may be the most polarizing book of all time; it seems like everyone gave it either one star or five.  When I was 22 (15 years ago) I read \\"The Celestine Prophecy\\", enjoyed it, and thought a lot about it afterwards.  Today I can't believe the younger me got sucked in to such spirtubabble....so something much have changed in me during that time.  Did I become jaded and cynical as I got older, or just wiser and more mature? <br /> <br />The point is, while I absolutely hated the Alchemist, finding it incredibly boring and staggeringly cheesy, I can't help but wonder if I would have liked it in 1992.  But if you are like me (today) and tend to roll your eyes and say \\"oh please\\" when you read about someone speaking to the sun and turning himself into the wind, then definitely save your money and more importantly, your time.
0763619612|5.0|Anyone who works with children and reaches out to give them a sense of self-worth deserves this book as a gift.  It is simple, gentle and touching.  The Dot is the story of a child who is frustrated with the artwork she makes until a teacher tells her simply, \\"sign it\\".  That small interaction gives the girl the confidence to take chances and grow until, ultimately, she's the one saying \\"sign it\\".  This book speaks to the idea that teachers really do touch eternity...they never know where their influence will stop.  If you have a favorite teacher, give him/her this book.

B000J10EQU|4.0|The latest installment in the Superman series attempts to be consistent with the history, but leaves enough room for a new Superman to emerge:  One still in love with Lois Lane, one a little too overconfident for his own good, and perhaps too self-important for his own good.  The result is a movie that surpasses the last in the series (Did anyone dare see Superman IV?) but doesn't quite close it like a Rocky Balboa. <br /> <br />Brandon Routh manages to make Clark Kent seem a little too cool, and Superman a little too dorky, but perhaps that's part of the act.  The movie is long - two and a half hours - and could've been clipped by thirty minutes without damaging anything. <br /> <br />It's a worthy movie, but by no means must see.
B000KRN67C|4.0|I've been waiting for a new Rotting Christ for a long time and I'm glad to say that this album will be another fine addition to everyone's Rotting Christ library. The best way to describe this album is a cross between the speed and attitude of \\"Khronos\\" and \\"Sanctus Diavolos\\" with the melodic riffs from albums like \\"Triarchy of the Lost Lovers\\" or \\"Sleep of the Angels\\". Throw that in with horns and female vocals that sound like ancient Greek music and you have \\"Theogonia\\". With some of these songs like \\"Nemecic\\", it almost sounds like Sakis took elements from the \\"Troy\\" or \\"Alexander\\" movie scores and combined them with the familiar Rotting Christ elements. The end result is interesting and makes the album stand out from the rest of the records. Sakis' lyrics on this album are even MORE abstract than before which makes it hard to follow the storyline, but in the end that doesn't matter. Bottom line: if you like Rotting Christ you will definitly enjoy this album.
B000JU7NCE|3.0|Well I have to admit when i found this new dvd here on amazon I was overjoyed and thrilled with the anticipation of a new Cure live Dvd.. After growing up with The Cure In orange and more recentley TRILOGY I have been in awe of there ability to capture there lush atmospheric textures and guitar ballads.. I felt a little let down with this one..as it says its shot by fans and crew and various people over a bunch of shows thru france/belgium/sicily/ switzerland. and more. the sound quality is good but the overall feel is a little cheap and a bit roughly handed but that does seem to be what they wanted.. a bare paired back rock and roll show.. and they never let you down on that.. its guitars andf feedback and simple lights and no special effects.... the last thing i would have expected from this band, But Obviously a lean towards where there maybe getting back to.. the list of songs is great but  not each song is given over to its full effect, this mainly being to the bands lineup now being a keyboard-less one.. altho the audience singing the keyboard lines in one song really did lift make me smile.  I'm a lifetime Cure fan so any live dvd is a great one but this does seem to be the \\" By the fans for the fans..\\" if you were to want to show someone a  Slick polished live cure DVd then stick to Trilogy.. keep this for yourself when your turining the lights down and kneeling infront of the tv screen and wishing you were in the front row..Its still worth every cent to any cure fan.. lord knows they don;t release enough to film.. i.e. wheres the Cure in orange DVD??  Buy this, just be prepared. Its a world away from TRILOGY.. they both stand in there own right.
0307346609|5.0|Max Brooks has outdone himself with \\"World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War.\\"  I am no professional historian, but I've read my fair share of history, and it's clear that Mr. Brooks has, too.  Only a scholar's mind with a dark, twisted soul could have produced such a chilling work of historical fiction like \\"World War Z.\\" <br /> <br />Oral history is a special sub-genre of history.  Essentially, an oral history takes the form of a series of separate interviews that the author strings together to make a narrative.  The author inserts a few of his or her questions into the text, but generally tries to make it appear that the entire interview flows smoothly from the speaker's lips (this is extremely hard to do, by the way).  The best oral historians, such as Studs Terkel, elevate the genre to an art form.  It can be tough getting used to - each interview is essentially its own little story, and it can make things a bit disjointed.  But in the right hands, it works. <br /> <br />Brooks' \\"history\\" is of the fictional Zombie War, when the undead rise to feast off the living.  \\"World War Z\\" interviews key players from this debacle, from a survivor of the initial outbreak in China to those who manned the barricades at the first doomed opposition to the zombie hordes, to the survivors.  Surprisingly intelligent and thoughtful, \\"World War Z\\" convincingly recreates a world overrun by zombies.  Brooks contemplates the impact of zombie infestation on our actual world in many different spheres, including the military (obviously), social, spiritual, environmental, and the like.  This makes for some very sad and moving passages, such as the doomed fate of the whales as man flocks to the sea, or the critical importance of dogs in the fight, or how a Russian woman \\"fights back\\" against the zombies by having as many babies as possible. <br /> <br />A surprisingly good effort, constantly taking the reader into unexpected areas and populated with realistic, human characters.  I'm not saying that Max Brooks is a literary artist along the lines of Cormac McCarthy or anything, but he set out to write an oral history of a zombie war, and it's hard to imagine that one could write a better version.

And until one fateful field trip at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, he is a normal dyslexic kid. When he gets there, things get weird. His teacher, who turns out to be a monster, attacks him. He then journeys to Camp Half-Blood, an eternal camp for those unfortunate kids whose parents are gods.

Now he has to go on a quest to find Zeus's bolt, getting help from his new friends at Camp Half-Blood along the way. But who can he really trust?<br /><br />Starting off a compelling new series by Rick Riordan, The Lightning Thief is a truly great book for lovers of fantasy and mythology.

The magician is uncaring and hard on Nathaniel while the magician's wife is very kind to him. Nathaniel dreams of going to Parliament with the other magicians and is bored by how slow his studies are going. He decides to study on his own and learns a great deal more than an apprentice his age should. After being humilated in front of many other magicians by Simon Lovelace (a magician himself), Nathaniel is set for revenge. He summons a djinni named Bartimaeus. From there many things happen that seem to get the both of them into more trouble than they were in the beginning. But they both know that Simon Lovelace is up to something bad but can they prove it? Will they ever be to overcome their bad luck? Will Nathaniel's dream of Parliament ever come true? You must read to find out!

1878424777|4.0|Well done.  This audio book was an easy listen, bringing to light concepts that we all are well aware of, yet fail to fully experience due to (in the author's words) \\"human domestication.\\"  The other reviews here do elaborate on this very well.  I personally feel this book would make a great gift for parents, teachers, care-givers, and especially so for teens.  It touched all of those roles within me that are still a part of me, and for that I am very thankful.  I also recommend \\"The Voice of Knowledge,\\" which is equally as stimulating.
B00005IC2H|5.0|For the most part, deciphering where a band hails from solely by the sound of a band's music is usually impossible.  With Sigur Ros 'Agaetis Byrjun,' you quickly learn to expect the impossible.  Iceland's sons definitely make their mother country proud because within the music you can see the cool weather and sparse yet bountiful landscapes that comprise their home.  In every song, emotion is stressed rather than finesse, and they execute it so well that it's hard not to get locked in.  Specifically on \\"Viðrar vel til loftárása.\\"  The beginning piano chords and the climax will send shivers down your spine and make your hair stand up on your arms while simultaneously causing goosebumps to erupt.  It's a captivating experience to say the least.   <br /> <br />I gave this album five stars because I believe that it's Sigur Ros' best work but mainly because it's utterly beautiful.  It's an icy sunrise; a dive into the vibrant deep; a synaesthetic dream; a bow to an electric guitar.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|In the series of Bond films this is the best of them all....I have seen them all multiple time s over the years and consistantly hear, Connery was the best, Roger Moore fit the title, Bronson was a perfect fit...If you go back and watch this titles again they seem all to campy and almost hard to watch in this day and age. Daniel Craig brings new life to the franchise in more was than one. Gone are the chessy lines, horrible acting and toyish gagetry. Craig portrays Bond as a a hard and no nonsense 007 the way 007 should have been in the first place. Sure the film is a bit drawn out during the gambling sequense but it more than makes up for it in the acting. Watch this film and I promise you you will not be able to sit through any of the pervious films as this one will hold you firmly in your seat from start to finish.
B000MCH5P4|1.0|There are so many things wrong with this movie that I find it hard to understand the number of positive reviews. This is mediocrity trying to pass as an enlightened film on how we are all connected and the global consequences of our actions. Every parent in this film was beyond irresponsible and should have had their children taken away from them.  <br /> <br />I'm suppose to believe that a well-off American couple deserts their also grieving young children to go to Morocco for \\"alone time\\" to recover from the Sudden Infant Death of their youngest child (talk about the me generation)? That this couple would leave their kids alone for weeks with the nanny (an illegal immigrant, day care provider)? That's just one of the many far-fetched steps that are used to force this movie along. <br /> <br />The shooting of Cate Blanchet's character was messed up.  Where was the continuity manager for the movie?  She was sitting on the driver's side of the bus, yet she was shot by a bullet fired from the opposite side of the bus. However, it is shown as if the bullet comes in her side of the window (this is cartoon physics where the bullet magically goes around the object). From the angle that the kid's fired the rifle, the bullet would have gone in the front or the front side opposite the driver and oppostie where Cate was sitting.  Based on where the bullet came in the bus, the local police should have been looking at the hillside area on the left side of the bus, but they still managed to find the shell casings high on a hill in a large landscape of desert, in just a short time.  This can only happen in a movie.  She was hurt so badly that her husband, Brad Pitt, (in yet another one-two note acting job) tried to keep the bus in the small town rather than try to reach a hospital. Yet she was well enough to talk and move around some before the helicopter finally showed up many hours after she could have been at the hospital. Also, was it because they were Americans that the shooting was tagged immediately as a terrorist event? Would that have been the case if the Australians or Germans on the bus had been shot?  This whole setup reeked of \\"the ugly American\\". <br /> <br />If one believes the premise of this movie that all the characters are tied together by the rifle, then Chieko's mother, who committed suicide by shooting herself, probably did so with the ill-fated rifle because of incest between the father and daughter (implied in the final scenes of the movie).  The father abandon's his daughter in her grief and goes to Morocco to shoot big-game (do they have any in Morocco) and leaves the rifle behind as a gift to his guide precipitating the events that bring all the families together. The guide sells the rifle to his friend for what seems like an extreme amount of money considering the circumstances in which they live.  <br /> <br />Once the kids have the rifle, they use it for what are the only believable sections of the movie.  They are told to shoot jackals to protect the family's most important possession, the goat herd.  Instead, being kids, they start shooting at rocks etc and aim at the bus because they don't believe the bullets can go that far.  Then they hide the gun and act like typical kids who have screwed up. <br /> <br />In the mean time, even with the mother having been shot and the father calling and telling the nanny (Amelia) to stay with the kids, she decides to take them to Mexico for her son's wedding in the car driven by her clearly irresponsible nephew. Instead of staying after the wedding for a reasonable time and letting the nephew sober up, they all get back in the car and end up in trouble at the border.  Amelia then makes every imaginable mistake, putting herself and the kids in life threatening situations, only to end up deported and no longer able to see the kids she claims (strongly) to the border patrol, that she loves. <br /> <br />This movie was an endless stream of improbable and impossible events meant to garner sympathy from the audience. It failed.  Gael Garcia Bernal and Cate Blanchett, both of whom are outstanding actors, were wasted; anyone could have played their parts.  <br /> <br />If you want a movie that shows how actions have global consequences see \\"Syriana\\". If you want a movie that makes a statement, see \\"Thank You For Smoking\\". If you want an Indie film that will make you think, see anything by Charlie Kaufmann.

1843104954|5.0|This book is considerably different from Attwood's 1998 book, in that it's more addressed to the general public, and has much more material about adult Aspies.  A great many scholarly papers and books have been distilled to make up a good portion of the material.  There is a great deal of encouraging material about materials developed to help Aspies navigate society, such as the Social Stories and Comic Strip Conversations of Carol Gray, and the Interactive Guide to Emotions by Simon Baron-Cohen and his associates.  Another stream of material is from the autobiographies of Aspies such as Liane Halliday Willie, Temple Grandin, Stephen Shore, Luke Jackson and Nita Jackson.  It's great to have a human face on the phenomenon of AS. <br /> <br />There seems to be a running thread through the book that sensory sensitivity is a bigger deal for Aspies than previously considered.  When I read the chapter on sensory sensitivity, I recalled autism books that suggested autism was a response to body chemistry equivalent to a non-stop drug trip.  I grasped that the sensory sensitivity that Aspies feel is a milder version of what autistic people feel.  I don't know if that's true, but that's what I grasped. <br /> <br />This book has a few chapters near the end dealing specifically with adult Aspies, chapters on career prospects and long-term relationships.  This is a welcome addition. <br /> <br />This will be a good first book for some time to come for anyone with an Aspie in their life.  It's not the last book, but it isn't really meant to be the last book.  It's meant to be the State of the Aspie Union address for 2007.  The message of the book is \\"We know more about AS than ever before.  We know more about what works for Aspie kids than ever before.  With a little help, Aspies can get along with society, leverage their talents and interests, and work around their weaknesses.\\" <br /> <br />
B000IFQLSW|5.0|This is the best Blues CD I have bought in a long time. I think this CD/DVD is perfect for both the experienced blues fan and the beginning blues fan. It capture the live feeling of blues, which even for the best live act is difficult to achieve. I love the varying styles, a great album from start to finish. It is nice to see KWS sit back and let the artists play. You can tell he is a true fan of the blues. I don't even know what to write about the DVD...AMAZING is all I can come up with. Thank You KWS.

0618680004|4.0|I was eager to read, 'The God Delusion' because of all the hype and because I'm a fan of Dawkins. I especially enjoyed, 'The Blind Watchmaker'. Let me start off by saying that the book is very easily readable. You'll get through it in no time. The print (at least in my paperback edition) was large and the pages rather thick. This obviously added to the massiveness of the volume, albeit unnecessarily. I would have preferred a soft paperback with a smaller font (like many of Daniel Dennett's books).     Anyway, Dawkins tears apart virtually every argument ever put forth in favour of god-belief. I say 'virtually' because he does not say much about belief in magic which is also used in many parts of the developing world as a reason to believe in the supernatural. Perhaps, being from the West, he thought it unnecessary. Anyway, he writes in his usual witty style with many anecdotes that are pure entertainment especially for atheists, like me. His emphasis is more toward why god belief is unnecessary rather than providing an alternative to those who fear being weaned of religion. He gives readers the benefit of the doubt that they will be able to trust their rationality and let it triumph over blind faith.     'The God Delusion' is less academic than his other works. I noticed a lot of references to Internet resources which I suppose are understandable in this day and age but would have preferred if he kept them to a minimum. Keep in mind however, that my opinion on that is from the perspective of a scientist. Perhaps since it's Dawkins' first real stab at organized religion, he has avoided getting too technical and overwhelming his target audience with endless references and footnotes (a trait seen in many of Daniel Dennett's and Sam Harris' books, albeit intended for a different audience). I understand Dawkins' intention in writing this book is to get religious readers to abandon their faith, which he thinks is more harmful than good. This shouldn't dissuade the religious from reading it though, since faith by its very definition, is immune to any arguments against it. What harm ever came from reading a book? Some people 'lost their innoncence' to books like 'The Case Against God' (George H. Smith) or 'Atheist Universe' (David Mills) and I'm sure some will lose it to 'The God Delusion'. I wouldn't look at it as a 'loss' really but rather a gain. The religious unfortunately have no idea how beautiful the intellectual freedom of a life without blind faith really is.    I think this latest work of his would make a great book for people who are uncertain about religious truth and are at crossroads in their life. Even long-time atheists would benefit from a fresh dose of reason and reality. No child should be indoctrinated with the teachings of any religous book without at least balancing that view with this book or one just like it. If you feel differently, then you either have no 'faith' in your children to think for themselves or have an agenda of your own.
B000LXHK2C|1.0|If you're into this kind of movies, see Under the Tuscan Sun, which does this kind of story perfectly. The Good Year has a predictable plot, bland acting, unlikely story, etc. The only good thing are the wonderful images of the Provence. The only reason I sat through this movie is that I was watching it in a plane.....
B00006CXSS|5.0|The other reviews will explain the story, I only want to add my highest recommendations.........
B00000F14B|5.0|Excellent movie.  Unacceptable DVD quality.  Had to return the first DVD.  The replacement had the same defect as the first.  Returned it for refund.  Decided not to buy any more DVD's from Amazon.
B000GUJYRE|3.0|I already have 2 sets of Beethoven symphonies cycle, Karajan, released 12/6/2005, and Gardiner, released September 20, 1994, and many other individuals. Then I pruchased this set because of reviews in Amazon here and nomination of Grammy 2007. After listening to some of them(No,3,5,9), I would say they are not that fantastic. The No.5 sounds strange in paticular comparing others. It seemed played in different pace from others. Then the overall recording quality is rather poor. \\"SACD\\" in here is somewhat misleading.  The live recording is more challanging than in studio. But SFS still could achieve well balanced and refined recording in live. Its Mahler NO.7 won Grammy classical award this year. However, I dont know it was recorded in live or studio. <br /> <br />I like Beethoven No.9 very much, not this one though. Try Osmo Vanska, released 10/24/2006. Its excellent performance and SACD recording even surpasses the Karajan.
B000002868|3.0|The heralding of a new genre to come was not articulated that well with the seminal bands debut, but this group of experienced and adventurous jazz vets certainly planted the seeds of what would be further excavations into the placement of jazzy music with this scattershot array of ideas. The band, just beginning to taste the artistic promise inherent in their musical questing, is obviously just starting to stretch their wings; regardless of the individual array of competence from the get go with Weather Report, it did take some time to gel as a whole. This seems most evident with the noticeably impressive, though deceptively shallow songwriting that makes up these eight tracks. Embellished by what seems to be a never-ending supply of bells and whistles, the vast majority of material here feels sketchy at best, often dragging listeners through the audio muck before quickly highlighting a few fast engaging musical ideas. Thankfully the band would continue to refine their pioneering sound on later releases, but here we just have the fiery, creative catalyst.
0694003611|5.0|My baby loves this book, she even learned to turn the pages herself! Great for bedtime. <br />

B000KGGLCU|4.0|I'm not going to write much about the concert because everybody knows how great it is and also you all know that MADONNA is the Queen of Pop, she knows perfectly what to do and what she does on stage is absolutely marvellous. <br /> <br />However, the main problem I found when I was watching the concert last night was the terrible editing that some of the songs have. I could enjoy Drowned World and Paradise (Not For Me), and some other songs, but many others have been edited in such a way that I had to turn on the lights of my room because I was beginning to have a headache. Every 3 seconds they jumped to another scene and I couldn't enjoy the concert that much. Some songs seem to be video clips and not a live concert, probably they tried to be original but they didn't succeed in letting us (the fans) enjoy the concert as if we were actually there. <br /> <br />I have a question: WILL WE EVER HAVE THE VIRGIN TOUR, BLOND AMBITION TOUR AND RE-INVENTION TOUR ON DVD? Can anybody tell me what's going on here? Such a great singer with very few DVDs. Madonna, do come to my country, Peru, we love you here, and I'm sure the Monumental Stadium would be full of people if you came one day.
B00005JNX0|5.0|Hysterical  and fun for all.Great voice over choices and the form of animation rather interesting
B000KGGLCU|5.0|The show is incridebly amazing, with lots of visual effects and introduces a new way to play a concert live by mixing songs in nonstop mode. <br />In spite of her new british-english speaking (which sounds very weird sometimes), this is Madonna at her best. <br />Great surprises are the new remixes for \\"Like a virgin\\", \\"Music\\", \\"Erotica\\", \\"La isla bonita\\" and \\"Lucky star\\". <br />At the very end of the show, there is a question to be answered: have you confessed? <br />By watching the show you'll have your own answers. <br />
B000BEZQ18|4.0|This soundtrack has some good songs, some not so hot. However I really liked the movie so I had to but the soundtrack.
1582701709|5.0|This book is a GREAT, fast and easy read.  Yet, it gets you REALLY excited about the laws of attraction.  There are so many awesome examples and stories on how these \\"laws\\" work for ANYONE that will try them.  It's an exciting concept and one that gives you genuine hope and belief that perhaps you CAN be in control of your life.  This is a great companion to the DVD.  It's really worth your time and money.  One of the better books on explaining the law of attraction.  The law of attraction works!
0385720920|5.0|I have steadily been impressed with this author's ability to draw signifigance out of his character's outrageous schemes and flawed characters.  The distance between where I started this book and where I left it felt much longer than a few hundrew pages.
B0000A1HQP|5.0|Amazon lists the language for this as English, and I ordered one from a reputable Amazon seller.  It was in FRENCH, with English subtitles!<br /><br />If anyone can find a version that is actually in English (even dubbed would be fine) I would love to know about it.  It is one of the funniest movies ever, but my folks can't read subtitles (too small) so this version was useless to us.
1582701709|1.0|I've read this book and the only \\"secret\\" is how to take ideas that have been around for thousands of years and market them under a \\"mysterious\\" sounding title for lots of money. Go to your library and read about Einstein or Henry Ford, etc. Who they were as people is a lot more fascinating than this book. I just found it to be hackneyed, and a lot of new-age hype. And by the way, I am very successful and have a good life because of HARD WORK and good decisions. No big \\"secret\\" there.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|This cd is most enjoyable and brings back many memories of the movie.
B00005M91K|5.0|One of the best movies I have ever seen.  Fricke was visiting artist at my university when I saw this.  If he didn't have connections there I may never have seen this masterpiece.  Better than all movies of this genre, including its own sequel.  I am not even going to talk about it anymore.  Just watch it and stop reading reviews about it.
B00000IFWE|5.0|The openning track is a great song, but you wonder if the rest of the songs will be as good.  I have played the album from beginning to end a few times now, and every song is sequenced perfectly on the album.  Sequencing is always important for a music fan like myself, because I always listen to the album from song 1 to song x.<br /><br />All 15 songs are great.  I love the last part of the last song.  I enjoy Tom Petty and the Heartbrakers because they aren't juvinile or silly.
0307237699|5.0|How nice to read a book by a politician who writes and thinks clearly and logically!  Obama really understands our current fundamental hinderance in political elections, of focusing on the wrong things, the trivial and petty. He seems humble, reasonable and generous and is clearly very intelligent.  It's wonderful that he chose to write a chapter on America's founding documents.  At this point, Obama has my vote in 2008.
034544678X|5.0|This is a wonderful book about dog and human communication, and why we do what we do. Of all of the dog books I have read, this has by far been my favorite. Patricia is a very entertaining writer and uses numerous stories and studies to explain her points. I think that this should be required reading for every dog owner.
B000MCH5P4|1.0|Some years ago T-shirts appeared with the slogan, `S#%@ happens'.  As a motto for life, this struck me as dull - there's an implied passivity, and a churlish irresponsibility in this glib phrase.  Certainly, such a statement harbours no promise of a narrative.  Inarritu seems to have taken this slogan as the foundation for `Babel'.  He presents a series of misfortunes which befall his victims.  They suffer, but are in no position for wilfull action - and so they suffer passively, as do we, the audience.  This is not so much drama as simply waiting for things to be over.<br /><br />The characters feel thin, largely as we do not see them making any morally consequential decisions.  The main plot points are accidents, or acts inflicted upon the protagonists.  If the characters reveal themselves at all, it is on less crucial matters.  This lack of decisive action by the characters, and the related feeling that they are not responsible for what happens to them, makes for dull narrative.  As some critics have suggested, `Babel' borders on boring.  Given the exotic locations, big name actors, hyperactive editing, and overbearing score, it's quite something for this film to be boring, but boring it is, and I think the cause lies with the passivity of plot and character already mentioned.<br /><br />Others have summarized the strands of the film, but here is another take:  Cate Blanchett gets shot (accidentally), and we (along with Brad Pitt) wait to see if she receives competent medical attention; the shooting jeopardizes the lives of the young Moroccan perpetrators, and we wait to see if the law apprehends them; Brad and Cate's children first see Mexico, and then are imperilled by the unmotivated crazed actions of their chauffeur - we wait to see if they survive; a mute young Asian girl shows us her nascent sexual longings, and we wait to see if anything happens here at all.  There's a lot of waiting going on, but far fewer laughs than in a Samuel Beckett play.  It's all very earnest, but to very little end.<br /><br />A word of warning too if hand held camera work blown up on a big screen makes you physically nauseous - there's enough here to induce queasiness.  The editing is also intemittently frenetic, so much so that I felt like I was trapped inside a food processor.<br /><br />In place of character development Inarritu offers gore and brutality, petty conflict, and adolescent nudity and sexuality, often with spectacular mountain backdrops or slick cityscapes.  It's questionable what literally tearing a live chicken's head off adds to anyone's cinematic experience.  Indeed, I wonder if the same might be said about virtually everything in this film.  Frankly, I wish I hadn't bothered seeing it in the first place.
0393317552|4.0|The book is scientific in nature.  It uses a scholarly tone but includes interesting anecdotes.  Theories are present and supported.  Contradictory explanations are noted.  I, personally, prefer fiction; however, I enjoyed this book.  It is a thinking person's book.  The PBS documentary was also enjoyable.  I saw this first, and it did help preface the book.

0393061434|2.0|I was really excited to buy this book and got it within the first couple weeks of it going on sale. I didn't get a chance to read it until a couple weeks ago and I can't say what an utter disappointment it was. Woz goes on and on about how smart he is and more importantly, how \\"right\\" he is about everything. I can only imagine that's what led to most of his bad investments and failed marriages.  <br /> <br />On top of that, the writing is horrible. I've seen better stories written by 12 year olds, though maybe that's who he is trying to appeal to? An amazing lack of information for a 200 page book.  <br /> <br />Don't waste your money on this book.
B000G03RJA|5.0|To me, no collection could ever be complete without including every track Laura ever recorded.  Hit or not, that is only spectulation by our obsession with the cencors of what is hot or not.  Radio does not play the whole impact of what the public really enjoys listening to.  Key words, \\"enjoys listening to, not what we are forced to hear on radio.  Laura shall live on in the musical soundtrack of our lives.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I know that this review won't be very helpful, all I can say is that I love this album.  Been listening to it for a couple of years now, and it's a fave when I'm in a mood to be mellow.  I am giving this five stars so that amazon will recommend more music like this in my personal recommendations.  Same with Fumbling Toward Ecstasy.
B000J103X4|3.0|The Game has potential. At least I think he does. However, his sophomore album is a lot like his first album, it falls short. If you ask me, I'd say his first album was better, as it had a lot more replay value, better production, better lyricism, and he sounded hungrier. On his second lp, he just keeps repeating himself.(apologizing to Dr. Dre, talking about how gangsta he is, how he'll beat you up, and how many girls and cars he has.) It sounds more west coast than his first one did, and I actually enjoyed the guest appearances, especially with Kurupt. But, The Game was way too repetitive on this album, and didn't sound as hungry as he was on his first album. He was repetitive on his first album, but you didn't pay as much attention to it because it was always over a blazing beat. I pay a lot of attention to lyrics anyway, and to be honest, at times it sounded like The Game wasn't really trying. Nonetheless, this isn't a horrible album by any means, it just doesn't distinguish itself from any other junk you find out there nowadays. In other words, it's just another modern rap album.
B000FIMG68|4.0|Note that this is Region 2 and see the disclaimer near the top.  I called, and they may have Region 1 in some time in the future, but not now.

0582411599|5.0|\\"Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?\\" is the title and the opening sentence of this excellent children's book by Bill Martin. My little one and her friends have been enjoying this book for a long time and it ranks among their most often requested books for reading.<br /><br />The main reason infants and toddlers love this book so much is its pictures. The illustrations in this book feature bright, colorful drawings and as you turn the pages, there is a large animal covering both sides of the page drawn with multiple shades of the featured color. The animals featured (in order of appearance) are: Brown Bear, Red Bird, Yellow Duck, Blue Horse, Green Frog, Purple Cat, White Dog, Black Sheep, and Gold Fish. Some of the pictures might seem like they would be a little scary to a child, but kids don't seem to care.<br /><br />Besides the visual aspects and helping kids learn about animals, this book also helps kids learn the names of different colors. Each color is repeated multiple times in the book's pages, helping kids learn what shade to associate with what color. Kids enjoy trying to pronounce the different animal words and colors. This makes the book educational and also fun. My little girl points at the pages and attempts to talk about what she sees and hears as the book is read to her.<br /><br />This book can be read to any child from infant through toddler and beyond but unless you purchase the board book version, you need keep in mind that little kids will possibly tear the pages. My little girl is still challenged with the urge to tear so I have to be careful whenever she uses this book. She will give in to her instincts unless someone stops her.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?\\" is an excellent children's book. My daughter and her friends love this fun, colorful book and they demand that it be read to them several times each day. It is simple, direct, short, and colorful; in summary, exactly the type of book that little kids enjoy.njoy.
B0000A118M|5.0|this is the work of a gigantic heart and soul who has mastered a musical language and shaped that language into sublime emotional poetry. mr coltrane sounds like someone digging deep within himself for these notes, choosing each one carefully to build a supreme architecture. his sax wails, sings, weeps, & cries out, notes formed & twisted & perfectly shaped. great tone. big sound. music for the heavens. an album to listen to throughout your lifetime. don't miss this masterpiece.
0380789035|2.0|According to the editorial reviews, American Gods is Neil Gaiman's best and most ambitious novel yet. If that's the case, I'd hate to have to read any of his other books.<br /><br />I had had such high hopes for it, as it's come highly recommended to me by just about everybody, but was very disappointed. It was boring and difficult to get through. If all of Neil Gaiman's books are like this, I don't think I'll be reading any more of them.
B000002I4S|5.0|to live a proper life you will of course need lots of john coltrane music. this album is an absolute must. from the saxophone pyrotechnics on the title track and the jazz lightning of \\"mr p.c.,\\" on through to the great melodics of \\"cousin mary\\" and \\"syeeda's song flute,\\" this is pure jazz magic. \\"naima\\" is a another standout; a piece of beauty, another coltrane classic. this was my first coltrane album, way back at the tender age of 20 (up to 45 now, i am), and it was the start of something very good in my life. coltrane's music has been a big part of my soundtrack ever since. life has been a richer journey for it, too.
B000GGSM76|5.0|Whenever I'm mourning the death of our old friend, Good Music, I just slap any Cure CD onto the disc player. The Cure is the definitive \\"80s and beyond\\" band. Their mercurial pop melodies mingled with singer Robert Smith's Poe-meets-Rimbaud-meets-Dr. Seuss lyrical musings and plaintive wail make The Cure a truly mesmerizing presence. All of its albums are stunningly solid efforts, including the recent \\"The Cure\\" and \\"Bloodflowers,\\" but 1985's \\"Head on the Door\\" is its most intriguingly layered offering, serving up an experimental foray into various musical styles; bits of flamenco, Japanese new wave, funk, hard rock, and even jazz sneak their way onto this magical album. The best part is, the Cure manages all the musical genre-melding without surrendering its trademark surrealistic sound.
B000GIWS7E|5.0|The disk 2 has a wrong information.The Great Debate (Live in Budapest 7/4/02) is false. This is Live in Bucarest!!!  <br />
B00005BF9Z|5.0|<br />I'll admit: I'm biased against current rock music, as much of it is generic waste. But Manu Chao is an outstanding original. The elusive Mr. Chao, former Manu Negra frontman, is a brashly inventive wellspring of talent, churning out quirky, catchy, funky tunes that embody seemingly every musical style in existence. I love the Zen zaniness exhibited on some songs (\\"Me Gustas Tu\\"), and the luxurious beauty of others (\\"Denia\\"). The musician's eclectic soul must be owed to his roots: he hails from southern France, but lives as a nomad of sorts in Latin America. Chao sings mainly in Spanish, but he displays an impressive multi-lingualism, crooning in his native French, as well as in English, Portuguese and even Arabic. Indeed, on some songs Chao mixes French and Spanish with such facility that it's easy to forget that they aren't the same language. Manu Chao embodies a true world music ethos, with a bohemian twist. <br />
B000ASDFJU|4.0|Outstanding series !! But beware season 3 does not work !! Even if you exchange it the replacement has the same flaw. Would have been a 5 if HBO didn't screw up season 3
B000089RV6|5.0|What would the world be without AC/DC? A lot less sexist, that's for sure. But despite the band's misogynistic mischief, \\"Back in Black\\" remains my most treasured hard rock album. The album's brutal beats, crisp guitar grooves, and delightfully guttural vocals offer a kind of raw redemption for the the band's debasing lyrics. On this album, AC/DC ministers the perfect marriage between soulful blues and slammin' rock and roll. The best part about \\"Back in Black\\" is its refreshing lack of pretense; unlike many hard rock albums from the same era, it's a polished but pure package, trading in cheap gimmicks for jagged sincerity. Cacophony never sounded so good.
B0007QJ1MK|4.0|The news that Oliveri was booted out by Homme did make me skeptical. Being a massive fan of Kyuss (for those unaware, the band the two played in before the QOTSA days), and a fan of all of QOTSA's releases, I felt the combination of Homme and Oliveri was one of the best in today's rock world, and taking ones influence away would be harmful. And I believe this is evident with \\"Lullabies\\", as it is their most hit and miss release yet - often excellent, but sometimes falling into uninspiring dirge.<br /><br />The hard rocking edge and emphasis on melody that was recurrent in their fantastic \\"Songs For The Deaf\\" album is repeatedly visited in the start of \\"Lullabies\\". \\"Medication\\" fashions that lovely bent for a good riff that Homme has always ensued in his different bands. \\"Everybody Knows You're Insane\\" has the typically weird and off-centre vibe QOTSA execute with ease. Their catchy and melodic pop-rock style is shown in the wondrous \\"Tangled Up In Plaid\\", my favorite track on the album, and again later with the hit single \\"Little Sister\\" and the lush choruses of \\"In My Head\\". So the opening of this album is very sharp and concise, almost refining the classic QOTSA styles into one side. To me these opening six songs are exactly what QOTSA should be doing, focusing on the niche they have carved out over the years, and adding and stripping the sound.<br /><br />The problem with \\"Lullabies\\" comes in the last half of the album which is painfully hit and miss. Homme can create some inspired music that drags you into the weird and wonderful world he portrays. Just go back into the catalogue, songs such as \\"You Cant Quit Me Baby\\", \\"The Sky Is Falling\\" and \\"Song For The Deaf\\" execute that eerie and dirgey style that borders on being a ballad in a very warped sense. These songs keep the attention, they create atmosphere and really balance the faster rocking songs the band is renowned for. The final half of \\"Lullabies\\" has some really hit and miss slower work - inspired at times, but frustratingly lifeless all too often. \\"I Never Came\\" is probably my favorite of the ballad styled songs, demonstrating Homme's melodic and pop sensibility, and hitting home with a good, earnest and relatable theme of relationship hardships. The theme is not original at all, but Homme's vocal delivery and poetic lyrics give it an honest and emotional edge. Unfortunately \\"Lullabies\\" really slips off the excellent pace. \\"Someones In The Wolf\\" is an overly long dirge that just doesn't do the trick for me. It becomes quite dull and never really picks up. And this pretty much applies for the rest of the ending, \\"The Blood Is Love\\" and \\"Skin on Skin\\" keep on this dull, lacking momentum, and gradually the album comes to a close.<br /><br />The stark hit and miss of \\"Lullabies\\" bemuses me. Homme clearly shows he can create some class without Oliveri as there are some real great rock songs here. But some of this album feels forced, feels like Homme was pushing a cool idea into a lengthy song as opposed to one riff, or one bridge. The longer songs just don't have enough about them, simple as that. Because of these songs I was a bit dissapointed with the album, as I wanted Homme to create another sprawling and classy release. The throw-away ending songs are made that much more frustrating by the opening songs which show exactly what Homme IS capable of. Hopefully the next album will be a more consistent affair.times, but frustratingly lifeless all too often. \\"I Never Came\\" is probably my favorite of the ballad styled songs, demonstrating Homme's melodic and pop sensibility, and hitting home with a good, earnest and relatable theme of relationship hardships.

B000M341QE|5.0|The movie is a very good crime drama. Sometimes it is even funny. Especially Jack Nicholson. He is a tremendous actor. The movie script is excellent. It is about police officers and criminals that all want promotion and recognition. But in life, to succeed, some people will turn into rats ...    In the end, we are ALL EQUAL HUMANS ONLY when we DEPART this world of injustice where the rats thrive.     Others can relate the story line much better.

B000002UAR|5.0|This British version of REVOLVER is definitive.<br /><br />\\"I'm Only Sleeping,\\" \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" and \\"Doctor Robert\\" were removed from the American release, so that the \\"Yesterday And Today\\" collection could grab a few million extra bucks from fans. Corporate greed's last triumph over artistic domain.<br /><br />Just as ABBEY ROAD belonged to Paul, REVOLVER is John Lennon's greatest Beatles record. It is a nearly flawless album-- superlative, supreme, super. REVOLVER belongs in every rock music lover's collection.<br /><br />Highest recommendation!<br /><br />TOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 34:52

B00005JMCT|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie. Lots of laughs and sophomoric fun that you've come to expect from watching all the movies in the American Pie series! Yes, this movie is a bit predictable, but nonetheless entertaining to watch.     It is nice to see Jim and Michelle get married in this movie and all the funny things that happen and go wrong along the way in planning for the wedding!
B000002H6C|5.0|Rollercoaster ride of the human mind with lots of twists and turns and complex topics. This is as close as Metallica has ever come to a concept album and they pulled it off in a brutally honest and complex way. Politics, corrupt justice systems, world destuction, horrors of war and child abuse are just a few of the topics touched upon. Mix this with blistering crunchy guitars, James' hard growling voice and Lars' finest drumming ever and you have a classic Metallica disk. Cliff would have been proud!
0439813786|3.0|The publishers of this children's book (it's intended for ages 9-12) appear to be trying their hardest to present this 500+ page book as boldly innovative. However, the mix of prose and pictorial storytelling didn't strike me as nearly beguiling as they would hope for. The concept for the story is decent enough (if a little overstocked in cliches) -- in post WWI Paris the titular young orphan lives secretly in the walls of a large train station (presumably Gare du Nord), where he keeps the clocks running smoothly (a job his uncle is too drunk to perform). His discovery of an old automaton brings Hugo into contact with an old man who sells small toys in the station, as well as his book-loving daughter, and a few other people. Without giving too much away, Hugo's discovery leads him into the history of early film, and the pioneering creations of George Melies (whose best known work is probably 1902's A Trip to the Moon). Along the way is the usual stuff, platonic boy/girl friendship, the quest for a father figure, a chase scene involving angry adult authorities, and of course, the clever orphan's ultimate elevation to a higher station in life (no pun intended). The story is perfectly inoffensive and can be applauded for its effort to interest young readers in the dawn of cinema, automata, and whatnot. Throughout the book, the prose part of the story is interrupted up by illustrations which advance the story and then redeposit it into prose. This is a perfectly fine technique, however the artwork doesn't really measure up to the prominence given to it. Selznick's drawings are rather flat and static, and I suspect will feel awfully tame to today's graphically-oriented kid. Later in the book, stills from old movies are used, and this is rather more effective and startling. On the whole this is a decent book, but nothing to raise a great hue and cry over.
B000002H33|5.0|This is and probably will always be my favorite album of all time.  The thought put into the lyrics,musical arangements,production and over all sound quality is nothing short of true brilliance. I've been listening to it since it's original release in 86' and it's just as fresh and mindblowing today as ever. A true masterpiece not just in the genre of Heavy Metal but in ALL music as we know it. NUFF SAID!!
1592401791|4.0|This book seemed to be the definitive Beatles book but Emerick kept dragging it down with his almost constant criticism of George Harrison. Granted, I want a book that will expose myths and I know, from reading numerous books on the Beatles as well as the excellent \\"Engineer's Notes to the Abbey Road Recordings\\", that while things noted in the book occurred, that doesn't mean that they mattered the way Emerick would have us believe.<br /><br />To see the behind the scenes creative efforts of the band is wonderful but to her Emerick tell it, George Martin contributed very little, Harrison could barely record a solo without Paul's help and of course McCartney was a step ahead of everyone.<br /><br />Granted, lots of reviews here that hate the book probably fall into the \\"Paul sucks\\" group and me, I tend to be a Harrison guy, but I still enjoyed the book and would recommend it.<br /><br />The best way to enjoy this book is to also read George Martin's book as well as The Engineers Notes to the recordings.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|Just saw the show in Chicago with a different (but great) cast. Its a fun, memorable, high energy show with many great songs like \\"Popular\\" and \\"Defying Gravity.\\" There are a few not-so-good songs but the good make up for the bad. If you have seen the show this very well produced CD is a must.
B000K7VHPU|2.0|SPOILERS BELOW...<br /><br />In The Illusionist we are presented with \\"Eisenheim\\" the Illusionist and his great magic show.  However, there's no real trickery in his show, just illusion as he clearly points out in a defining moment of the film.  He has come a long way since his childhood and is now an elite member of society you could say.  People flock to his show, and he even gets the attention of the crown prince of Vienna, Prince Leopold.  To say his showmanship goes unnoticed would be to say something to the effect that the sun never shines.  Clearly not true as he seems to sell out every show and it clearly becomes a standing room only event.<br /><br />The problem I had with this movie was the storyline or lack there of it.  The plot is simple, Eisenheim loses a childhood love, and then encounters her once again years later.  He's now a famed magician and will do anything in his power to get her back for good this time around.  Some people get in his way, but in the end he fools everyone and moves away with his long lost love.  But here's the problem, the seperation between him and Sophie was not tragic at all.  Something I think this film needed so that we could better understand Eisenheim's motivation.  Her parents forbaded her from seeing Eisenheim ever again and he eventually moved away and became the man he is at the present day.  The movie only shows them together for a few moments and while I don't question the authenticity of the childhood love or crush, I question the fact that there was not enough substance about the relationship in the film to go along with the plot.  As a member of the audience, I found it hard to believe that after all those years, he still longed for her and had not really \\"moved on\\".  Again, I don't question the fact that he possibly loved her so that he couldn't get his heart away from her, but the film doesn't show any of that.  I think this is a critical mistake by the director.  Sophie doesn't help this point either when she agrees to flee with Eisenheim before putting any real thought into what she was about to do.  So we're supposed to believe that after all these years, their love is still strong and that she will leave her whole life behind to run away with him?  Believable?  Maybe, maybe not.<br /><br />The movie is split into 3 main parts that don't fully describe Eisenheim's life so that we may better understand who he is.<br />1.  He's a boy and he falls in love.<br />2.  He becomes a famed magician after a chance encounter with another magician who may be real or may not be real.<br />3.  He finds his long lost love and comes up with some unreal illusion to fool everyone so that he may run away with her.<br />I was scratching my head and trying to understand what he was really trying to do by performing his \\"spirit\\" illusion trick.<br /><br />Again, the gaps in this film do little to describe Eisenheim and do little to provide what was behind his motivation to do the things he does in this film.<br /><br />I was fortunate enough to see the movie The Prestige before I saw this one.  I was blown away by it, and I knew what to expect when going in to watch this one.  The final issue I had with the film was the actual \\"trick\\" itself or lack thereof.  If you think about it, the only way the trick would have worked (as presented by the film) was if the prince was somehow out of the picture.  But to have him commit suicide?  I don't get it.  At the end the viewer is made aware that the \\"trick\\" was actually a well-planned set up by both Sophie and Eisenheim.  Therefore, I don't understand why the Prince, knowing he's actually innocent and knowing Giamatti's character could be silenced easily, would shoot himself.  He's a prince.  His father would have easily taken his word over the chief inspector's.<br /><br />So....<br />The prestige in this film is that Sophie was eventually brought back and was reunited with Eisenheim.  Great.  However, as in the movie The Prestige, the audienceis shown how everything came to be.  What about the illusion trick?  How did he do it?  Did he actually posess mystical powers?  No one knows.  I think the movie left both audiences hanging.  The audience portrayed in the movie, and the audience who have seen this movie in the theater and can now watch it on DVD.trick?

B000H30B2C|4.0|I just finished watching the entire 3 disc extended edition with all the extras, including the film with commentary by Peter Jackson and screenwriter Philippa Boyens. I must say it was worthwhile as I am a Kong-a-phile. There are many insights into the making of the film, but what stood out for me in the commentary was the fact that Jackson evidently did NOT have final say in what was to appear on the screen. I was amazed to find him admit that he had to cut out two great dinosaur action sequences on Skull Island to shorten the film. Those two dinosaur scenes (which are included in this edition) amounted to 13 minutes of great action. Peter Jackson was convinced by the screenwriters to \\"develop\\" the characters to the point where he had to shorten the film time. He gave in and eliminated two action scenes: the \\"crossing-the-swamp scene\\" and \\"the Stegasaurus\\" scene. These scenes were, as he explains, an \\"homage\\" to the original 1933 Kong. Both cut-out scenes used different creatures than the original 1933 version, but he really wanted them in the theatrical version. You'll also see the ONLY ANIMATRONIC dinosaur used in the film. It was cut out of the theatrical version. (a large flightless bird-like creature). The screenwriters and producers pressured him to cut the time down. In my view, cutting out seven minutes on board ship getting to to Skull Island and seven minutes back in New York at Adrien Brody's play and Naomi Watts' floundering dance routine, etc., would have made up for the time needed for the two dinosaur sequences and would have certainly quickened the pace of the original theatrical film.<br /><br />  At one point Jackson regrets cutting out so much of the action and says he wants to make it again. My advice: Dump the committee and do the film again. He even suggests, laughingly, that the Venture would have to stop and refuel in South American where Kong escapes, finds a lost world of dinosaurs and gets re-captured before going to New York. You can tell he has his regrets about the final theatrical cut!<br /><br /> EXTRAS: The extras in this edition show many deleted scenes on board ship. They are mostly of the crew and computer generated Pre-Visualization, called CG Pre-Viz, for short, which was absolutely necessary to make this film and to make Kong come to life. You'll see a Pre-Viz Kong leaping across New York skyscrapers. One great Pre-Viz sequence is the Bronto stampede. You'll see how it was conceived and made. You'll see Andy Sirkis (who was also Lumpy the Cook) doing Kong body and facial movements, being computer recorded [aka: undergoing motion capture] against blue and green screens and much more. This is how Kong was brought to life, literally. You'll go into the WETA workshop and see the artists and sculptors at work making 3D dinosaurs and Kongs. You'll see how an exact scale model of the Venture was built and used in many of scenes. Also, how a full size 1950's diesel ship was purchased and retro-fitted to look like a 1930's tramp steamship. You'll be amazed to see how the special effects crew got a robot computer program to rebuild 1933 New York City right before your very eyes. It can rebuild, on a computer screen, any street and any building known to exist in 1933 Manhattan. There's a birthday film that the crew did for Peter Jackson; it's somewhat funny. And there are plenty of Kong artwork from the 1996 pre-production film that was never made and artwork from this production put to music that shows, in story-board format, how the director and writers put scenes together. There are full 1996 and 2005 scripts on ROM. A gag reel that isn't that funny.

B00005OCMR|4.0|I really like this film, I think I like it more now than when I saw it as a teenager.  Anyways, two quick points here.  First, is that \\"speed-cycle\\" scene incredible or what?!  Fantastic.  Also, how about the bad guys' computer desk that he uses to work with MasterControl?  It is STILL one of the most radical computers ever, in history!  If I were in control of a large computer company or whatever, my computer would look just like his!  Is it just me, or does it remind anyone of the upcoming iPhone?  cheers
B000K7UBTI|4.0|The Invincible Iron Man is the first out of the three recent Marvel animated releases that I think is the most solid.  It uses what I call the \\"Spiderman Movie formula\\" where the story takes its time before putting a costume on our hero.  The same can be said here where we get to learn all about the characters before a fateful situation causes Tony Stark to build the first Iron Man armor.  The CGI used on the Elementals and all the Iron Man armors is cool.  It really adds to the fight scenes.  What I really found interesting was the whole technology vs. magic theme.  It was always weird to me that The Mandarin, a mostly magic using villain, was Iron Man's nemesis in the comics.  But I think this was Marvel's chance to show this kind of a story.  For the Iron Man live action movie due out in 2008, director Jon Favreau has stated that his take on The Mandarin will be more tech than magic.  So this animated movie is a good way to show the tech vs. magic theme that will be absent from the live action movie.  For a character that I don't follow much, it was a well done animated film.
B00005JNS0|4.0|This movie followed the Disney formula to a \\"t\\"---a little non sexual romance, in jokes for the parents and older children, simple story line with clear good guys and bad guys spelled out---except this time, it was directed more for the little \\"princes\\" than the \\"princesses\\".  Not that both won't enjoy it. Like Finding Nemo, it was a completely enjoyable little film to entertain your children.  However, unlike Finding Nemo, there was no real depth to the film.<br /><br />Take it for what it is and you'll like it very much.  It's VERY good but not a future classic.
B000J103PC|5.0|\\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" is a most surprising treat. It is a fantastic movie that works on many levels - it is both a sharp satire and an ode to good stuff in life (clothes), both hilarious and dramatic. It manages to capture the world of not only fashion, but also its victims, so it will unapologetically make you feel like on high-heels after you're through with it.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway plays Andrea, a down-to-earth girl fresh out of college. She couldn't care less if her sweater is blue or turquoise, because she wants to become a journalist, and good journalism doesn't have anything to do with looks, right? She is about to see how wrong she was, when she gets a job as a personal assistant of the first lady of fashion, Miranda Priestly, editor of a Vogue-style fashion magazine called \\"Runway\\". Hathaway is perfect for this role - her big eyes and a killer smile make us be on her side from the very first shot. However, she is not just a pretty face - her performance gives Andy substance, making her a not completely sympathetic character. She has an attitude when it comes to fashion, and it is refreshing, after zillion portrayals of rich people who do not notice sheer mortals, to see a character who looks down to those above her on the social scale, like Andrea does.<br /><br />Guess what? Meryl Streep is amazing. After all those downers she has masterfully graced (\\"The Hours\\", \\"Music of the Heart\\", \\"Adaptation\\"), it is wonderful to see her do some comedy. Streep plays the title character and manages to make it her own. It would be easy to play Miranda like Glenn Close played Cruella DeVil, with cruel laughter and constantly raised voice. However, Miranda is always calm - her voice is low, but firm, and her movements are graceful, yet measured (in millimeters) - sometimes, she only lifts an eyebrow, or moves her chin. This makes the Devil scary, bossy and - here's the surprise - touching. It is an Oscar-worthy performance, and I am not even kidding.<br /><br />Although Streep steals the show, and Hathaway is good enough to not be buried by her co-lead's on-screen presence, there are some other notable performances. Emily Blunt plays Miranda's other assistant with just the right dose of bitterness and vulnerability.  Stanley Tucci is great as Andy's sidekick, not overplaying his character. Also, the soundtrack is amazing - tracks like Madonna's \\"Vogue\\" or Mocean Worker's \\"Tres Tres Chic\\" are perfect in the movie's context. It is truly a movie to have on your shelf, and to watch it more than once. And then maybe read some \\"Faust\\" afterwards.als the show, and Hathaway is good enough to not be buried by her co-lead's on-screen presence, there are some other notable performances.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|\\"Casino Royale\\" blew me away. It is a fantastic movie in every way, and also the best Bond so far! I have always liked Pierce Brosnan (for some reason, other people didn't) in this prestigious role, and now that he has retired as a 00 agent, it is great to see someone even better replace him.<br />\\"Casino Royale\\" revisits the beginnings of the well-known British secret agent, and it does so in a very stylish manner. Every second of the movie is carefully thought out, and it really is perfect. James Bond is now played by Daniel Craig (\\"Elizabeth\\", \\"Sylvia\\", \\"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider\\"), who adds an interesting twist to this well-known character. Apparently, in the beginning, Bond couldn't care less if his martini was shaken or stirred, his first kill was pretty rough and not at all elegant, and he was also a little kinky. Of course, he has always been very cool, with the latest gadgets, fast cars and beautiful women.<br />Speaking of women, \\"Casino Royale\\" doesn't disappoint. The latest Bond girl is Eva Green. As every good Bond girl should be, she is not both beautiful AND brainy, and is very believable in her role. Also, she is one of few 007 love interests to not be interested in Mr. Bond... until she is, of course.<br />And of course, there is action involved, and lots of it. However, the movie is very smart - not all action consists of explosions, guns and foreign assassins (although, it's not like these elements aren't there!). In order for Bond to successfully accomplish his mission, this time he doesn't need to kill anybody... he needs to win a game of poker. Although this may sound like a major turn-off, it is magnificently executed - the scenes around the table are awesome, exciting and full of drama. Also, there is a sub-plot involved, because you don't just become 007: there is something for Bond, James Bond to do before he gains his title.<br />\\"Casino Royale\\" is one of the most satisfying movies to come out in 2006. It is everything a James Bond movie should be, and then some. Judi Dench is at her usual super-self, Eva Green is mesmerizing, and Daniel Craig... let's just say he might as well be the ultimate James Bond!some.

B000L43AN4|5.0|Absolutely Amazing! Mr. Waits' talents are demonstrated completely on all 3 discs. Granted, not all of these tracks are something that you'd play for someone who has never heard of Tom Waits, but together, the set flows like very few box-sets/compilations do. Most are hits packages with b-sides and/or demos thrown in, whereas Orphans sounds just like a Waits album should, with all of the musical beauty and surprises, and a scruffy voice to keep it from getting the least bit pretentious. As for the lack of printed lyrics, it is a shame, but I would contend that it will make the listener listen that much harder, to get the full effect. The only thing I dislike about this set is that I'm now REALLY dying to see Mr. Waits play a show here in Syracuse.
B000JJRIN4|4.0|After the successful release of 'Love, Angel, Music, Baby', Gwen Stefani is back with her sophomore disc, 'The Sweet Escape'. After milking her first album for all it was worth with the release of five singles, it appears Stefani barely had time to rest before 'The Sweet Escape' was suddenly being promoted. One might think it absurd that she had any time to record tracks for a new album while also working on her clothing line, giving birth, and caring for her new son. However, the Christmas boom was lurking ever-nearer and it is very likely that both Stefani and her label opted to push the album out for maximum profits. It is unsurprising to find out then, that many of the tracks appearing on 'The Sweet Escape' had been recorded for 'Love, Angel, Music, Baby' but were discarded. First thought upon such news is that The Sweet Escape' will be lackluster at best; however it is not a huge disappointment. In fact, there are numerous solid tracks on the album.  <br /> <br />Following in the footsteps of its predecessor, all of the tracks on The Sweet Escape' have their own distinctive vibe. However, the album lacks a solid theme. On Love, Angel, Music, Baby', all of the tracks could have stood on their own as decent and unique singles but also contributed to the general over-the-top, dance, pop record. In contrast, though The Sweet Escape' is certainly the owner of quite a few good tracks, they don't sound as though they belong on the same disc. Though it is certainly a catchy, guilty-pleasure album, it lacks the same thought and care that was so obviously put into Stefani's first album. In addition, there seems to be a distance from the subjects addressed and less passion involved in The Sweet Escape' although much of the content is seemingly more personal (for example the discovery of her pregnancy in Don't Get It Twisted' and wedded bliss in Fluorescent').  <br /> <br />Despite such seemingly negative criticisms, Stefani's sophomore solo album is certainly not bad. Infact, it's quite enjoyable, considering it's meant to be sugary, pop-fluff. Though oft criticized for borrowing from other sources, Stefani and her team have put together an exceedingly inventive album. It is quite impossible not to make use of elements from other sources considering that almost everything has been done. Thus, Stefani does indeed utilize things such as yodeling in a tribute to The Sound of Music' (as heard in the opening Wind It Up'), but she makes no excuses for it and makes homage as opposed to parody or outright theft. In addition, she also puts her own twist on whatever aspect she uses and makes it her own, such as rap beats in Orange County Girl' or clanking machinery in The Sweet Escape' and Yummy'. <br /> <br />Laden with purposely overproduced, quirky, fun, and upbeat tracks, The Sweet Escape' is certainly a pleasant and welcome escape from reality. Every CD collection requires a silly album one can listen to either with friends or as a guilty-pleasure. Either way, Stefani certainly fills that description nicely. Though The Sweet Escape' is a far-cry from a masterpiece, it succeeds in doing exactly what it set out to do and fans of pop-dance music of the sort will be pleased.

B000K7VHPU|3.0|Before \\"The Illusionist\\" I had watched \\"The Prestige,\\" being a bale head<br /><br />I loved it, but when I saw \\"The Illusionist\\" I wasn't that impressed.<br /><br />Although, the actors in the movie are really well-known I don't think<br /><br />Norton was as good as he has been (for me he doesnt look the part)<br /><br />and The plot/story wasn't as thought-out as \\"The Prestige\\"<br /><br />*SPOILER*<br /><br />To me, the part which made me so angry was when Giamatti's character finally<br /><br />finds out that Norton was not the killer. DUH<br /><br />The Jewels=The Sword<br /><br />how could it have been more obvious????<br /><br />Besides that, I thought the movie was pretty good, but the Actors<br /><br />in it were too good for the script. Also, releasing two \\"magic\\" movies<br /><br />at the same time was pretty dumb...<br /><br />P.S. it really depends on the movies you like, if you're more of a romance/drama kind of person watch \\"The Illusionist\\" if you're into action<br /><br />and suspense go for \\"The Prestige\\"

B00000331V|4.0|An apt salute to the six studio albums of boogie rock that the J. Geils Band had recorded between 1970-1975, this 1976 live extravaganza showcases the band at their best--performing live! It is also a capable followup to 1972's Full House, which remains one of the best live recordings of any American band in the 20th century!  <br />  Released at a time when live albums were big sellers (Frampton Come Alive, Kiss Alive, i.e.), this underated gem gives the band a chance to deliver their best songs with irreverent energy and unstoppable rythym that'll have you dancing within the first two minutes of the opening \\"Southside Shuffle\\" till the last chords of \\"Give it to Me\\" <br />  Some may find Peter Wolf's banter a bit lengthy and/or annoying in between many songs on Blow Your Face Out! Others may find Wolf's pre-rap, D.J.'ish chatter a novelty....Either way it's in-your-face fun!

B0002VEPRQ|4.0|Amazingly, this movie is a brilliantly fun trip down family film lane.  \\"Mary Poppins\\" gives the audience a well off but troublesome British family who is in need of a new Nanny by the name of Mary Poppins.  During the time that Mary Poppins spends with the family they are able to reconnect with themselves as individuals and as a family.  In the end everything comes together and Mary Poppins is on her way out because her job there is done.   <br />   A classic family film that has stood the test of time.  Which can be enjoyed by not only children of today but of children of yesteryear(the parents of today's children).  Because when you watch this movie you never really grow up and realize how wonderful this film actually is.

0716703440|3.0|The Author attempts the very remarkable objective of satisfying everybody's needs in one single book. For that purpose the book is divided into track 1 and track 2 sections. Unfortunately, this attempt is, in my opinion, not completely successful. Advanced GR readers will surely find too many trivial topics in the book, while beginners will have difficulties even with track 1 pages. My review will provide the advanced beginner's point of view. I read all track 1 sections and a few track 2 at the beginning of the book.<br /><br />The first part of the book where geometrical objects, one forms and tensors are described is very pedagogical. However, as more advanced topics are introduced you are left with the unease feeling that something important is left behind. The answer is clear, what is missing is track 2 contents, but track 2 are much more difficult to read. By reading just track 1 sections you are led too fast to the deeper results of GR. The treatment is too superficial and a lot of results are taken for granted; or referred to track 2 pages.<br /><br />There are a lot of exercises and examples in the book. However, few exercises are solved and the examples frequently refer to sideways difficult physical topics, surely not meant to clarify the main text.<br /><br />The huge size of the book adds up to its reading difficulties. It is heavy and overwhelming. I usually try to reduce costs by choosing paperback editions, but the size of this book could justify a hardcover version.<br /><br />In summary I must say this is not a book for beginners. I found its writing style confusing and my knowledge in GR was little improved by reading track 1 sections. To my discharge I must say I read without difficulties Foster & Nightingale's and Carroll's but could not get through Wald's.  My recommendation would be to start with Foster's, then continue with Carrols's and next, what's next? Misner's is surely not a good third step.<br /><br />The book may be more appropriate for advanced students. I intend to follow the author's suggestions and make a second reading including the most interesting track 2 sections.low the author's suggestions and make a second reading including the most interesting track 2 sections.

B00005JPBD|5.0|...the petite but glorious Penelope Cruz!  Whom I've always admired, though she does tend to land some rather cheesy roles in rather cheesy Hollywood films these days, hence many people are very surprised to see her true acting skills come out as they do here.<br /><br />However, Pedro Almodovar is neither Hollywood nor cheesy, in fact he is easily one of the most accomplished and interesting directors of the past 25 years.  His earlier films were admittedly wilder and loonier (\\"Matador\\" and \\"Tie Me Up Tie Me Down\\" among my faves), his previous 3-5 films like this one reflect a much more mature, restrained and masterful artist---similar to Clint Eastwood's evolution from Mr. Macho Gunslinger to the thoughtful and powerful director that he is today.<br /><br />Like all of Almodovar's films, \\"Volver\\" is primarily about women and his profound love of women.  Which is rather interesting considering that Almodovar is a gay man, especially the times when his camera lovingly caresses his actresses' luscious cleavage.<br /><br />Other reviewers will rehash and/or summarize the plot to no end, so I'll just say that if you are a plot-obsessed viewer, you probably won't like most of Almodovar's films.  They are all driven by the originality, depth and fascinating unpredictability of his characters, and also by the lush and lyrical beauty of his visuals---every frame, every moment is beautiful, there are no throw-away, push-the-buttons-of-the-focus-group-audience scenes as we too often get ad nauseum in mainstream commercial films especially the Hollywood variety.  There are no predictable, safe, feel-good earnest happy endings calculated to sell movie tickets and hideously overpriced concessions.<br /><br />As a result you can watch an Almodovar film over and over again without ever getting sick of it, because there are always more things to notice and appreciate, because the whole thing doesn't hinge around some stupid special effects or by-the-numbers dumbed-down plotline.  Definitely worth owning!<br /><br />Being a Netflix junkie, this was my first trip to the cinema in almost a year, and boy am I glad I chose this one.wn plotline.

The only deleted scene was terrible, and to watch it, you had to listen to the director whine about how he shouldn't have cut the scene, but the scene was terrible.

B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I've seen all the filmed versions of Pride & Prejudice, and found each one to be enjoyable in its own unique way.   <br /> <br />There is no reason to remake a film if it is going to be exactly like the one before, and with this latest version of  P&P, director Joe Wright, who is quite a young man, was obviously unwilling to create just another clone. Instead he has chosen to shock us a little by his attention to realism in the settings and activities surrounding the characters - using social documentary, circa 1797, to emphasize the differences in social status of the family groups in the story.  <br /> <br />I particularly like the scene where the Bennet ladies visit Netherfield when Jane is sick.  They all sit on the sofa in their best, but dated \\"provincial\\" Georgian clothes, while Caroline Bingley is dressed in the height of fashion in an elegant high-waisted Empire gown. <br /> <br />Life in an English country manor 200 years ago was far from palatial. Even Great Houses were dark and drafty and often dirty.  There was no indoor plumbing, electricity, washing machines, drycleaning, cooking ranges, refrigeration, vacuum cleaners, or central heating. Fireplaces smoked, floors creaked; roofs leaked; water and wood and coal was carried in; ashes and slops were carried out. Livestock was everywhere and flies followed them. There were not even any commercial soaps or cleaning materials - you had to make your own from caustic chemicals.  New furnishings, drapery and carpets were expensive, and hand-me-downs were valued, even if threadbare and faded.  <br /> <br />Austen mentions only 2 indoor servants at Longbourn - the cook and Hill, the maid of all work, and both would have worked long hours. The daughters would have had to make up the slack, although Mrs Bennet makes it clear cooking was beneath them.  Even the family's riding horses must do double duty on the farm. Life at Longbourn would not have been up to the standards of Rosings and Pemberley, which though they were palaces, would have suffered the same housekeeping difficulties as Longbourn -  but would have more servants to throw at the problems.  <br /> <br />Jane Austen devoted few words to descriptions of houses and housekeeping. She expected her readers would be familiar with life in various social milieus. We have been reading between the lines, and our reading has not always been accurate, if one is to judge from the disappointed comments of some viewers. <br /> <br />This version will never replace the earlier versions, but it does add another point of view, as the film \\"Clueless\\" did for \\"Emma\\". Wright has taken some liberties with the characters, making Mrs Bennet more sympathetic.  I found the dialogue was rather mumbled, but,like most Janeites, I  know it  by heart so it didn't matter very much.  I expect the film's biggest audience will be Janeites who already know the story & appreciate a fresh look at it.  Just think of all those versions of Shakespeare's plays & no one has got tired of doing another after 400 years.
0920668364|5.0|Let me preface this by saying that I consider myself to be a fairly masculine 37 year old man.  Well, the other day my 5 year old daughter picked this book to purchase with her Christmas gift certificate.  That night, she was laying down on my lap while I read this book to her.  It started off well enough, but went downhill almost immediately.  After the second \\"chapter\\" I was tearing up, by the 4th, I was crying almost uncontrollably.  I could not finish this book.  Thankfully my daughter was asleep by this time.  I will try to finish it when I read it to her again tonight.  But the prognosis is not good.    I would recommend this book to any parent that has looked at their child with some kind of sadness after realizing that they aren't a baby anymore.

B00005JPKC|5.0|A simply stunning and moving motion picture. This is not a movie to be enjoyed, but rather one to be experienced. This movie is wonderfully done, and although I do like the movies Clint Eastwood directs, I really do think he has surpassed himself. <br /> <br />\\"Letters From Iwo Jima\\" basically revolves around a \\"grunt\\" soldier named Saigo, a Japanese soldier who has found himself stationed on the remote island of Iwo Jima. Saigo was a baker in Japan and left behind a pregnant wife, and is a much happier baker than soldier, but is resigned to doing his duty. Through Saigo the audience is to experience the battle of Iwo Jima from the Japanese perspective. <br /> <br />I have watched other WWII movies from the Japanese side, but none seemed to truly capture the essence and spirit so fully as this film has. There are no stereotypes here. While there is brutality, the audience is also shown the fact that there was humanity, too. I had expected to see a film that gave a sympathetic view to the Japanese (\\"hate America, love the enemy\\"). Instead, I felt I saw a movie that was balanced with good and bad of equal measure - and on both sides. In battle, with those fighting at ground zero, it's hard to say who is right and wrong. This movie expounds on that. <br /> <br />Also, this movie shows clearly how the Japanese war machine worked and how different it was from the Americans. The Americans hoped to return and suicide was never encouraged. The Japanese were told they were not going to return and that suicide was the only honorable \\"out\\" if one stood in jeopardy of being taken captive. <br /> <br />Even though the film is in Japanese and subtitled in English, it only intensifies the emotions one goes though while watching it. This is an intense, emotional and moving film. Clint Eastwood has truly outdone himself. <br />

B000M4RG42|3.0|After reading the book of the same name and knowing that Cline Eastwood would be directing the movie, I had hopes for this movie. I do believe that my opinion of the movie was more than a little biased based on the fact that I had read the book previous to seeing the movie. Having the background of the book, the movie clicked much more easily for me. However, if one had not had the advantage of reading the book, this movie would probably be a bit of a disappointment.  <br /> <br />The movie is not simply a \\"war movie\\" in that it is to tell the story of Iwo Jima. The idea behind the movie is to follow the six men who were captured in the now famous photo of the raising of the flag over Iwo Jima. Because of the popularity of that photo, the US War Department used the three surviving men in a very blatant exploitation to sell war bonds. <br /> <br />The major problem with the movie is that it never connects the viewer with the six men the movie is about. This is a real shame because the book spends half the pages going into the backgrounds of each of the six men, from their childhood to their decision to join either the Marines or the Navy. Without this very vital piece of information a huge, very human part of this very touching story is missing. I'm not sure how Eastwood could have done this, but I really feel that more of the backgrounds of the six men should have been included, somehow. <br /> <br />The problem I had with the movie was in the method of telling the story, which is in flashbacks. This can be an effective tool, if used sparingly and used well, but in this movie the story seems to get a bit bogged down - especially if one hasn't read the book and doesn't really understand what is going on. <br /> <br />Overall, I enjoyed the movie and I think those who read the book will feel the same way. Yet, I don't think that a movie based on a book should require as a pre-requisite that the audience read the book before seeing the movie to fully enjoy the experience. A movie should be able to fully stand on its own.

B000002UAX|2.0|This CD is alright. Back In The U.S.S.R. is pretty good. The Cd is all over the place and pretty self indulgent on the part of Paul McCartney. This is definately The Beatles on their decline.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|This is a really great CD, it has that raw energy that rockers had back in 1970s and that is long gone from the rock-n-roll establishment. This days you either find energy or decent melody, but almost never these two come together. Franz Ferdinand is making a point of giving each song a \\"hook\\" as they call it, a tune that sticks in your head and makes you want to dance or jump or simply listen to it again. <br />Having said that I was quite disappointed with their second CD which I think  does not compare to this one. I hope they will keep writing and singing and performing for years to come. I am certainly looking forward to hearing more of them.

B000A7Q2DM|4.0|I'm a huge music collector, and I'm always familiar with rock artists and their songs, even if I don't care for them much.  In the fall of 2005, 30 Seconds To Mars was nothing more to me than a band name that I had heard a couple people mention once or twice.  I then saw them perform at a radio festival here in Houston, and I thought they had a pretty decent sound and I was really impressed with the energy of the singer (actor Jared Leto).  Almost a year later, their song \\"The Kill\\" started to get heavy radio play.  The first couple times I heard it, I didn't really think one way or the other about it, but one day I couldn't get it out of my head.  So I picked up \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" to see how it was...<br /><br />At first I kinda noticed that they didn't sound as heavy as they had in concert, and that it sounded a bit emo-ish.  I hate emo music, but still I thought the CD was pretty decent.  After I got use to their style, I really started to love this CD.  Besides \\"The Kill\\", there are some great songs on here like \\"Attack\\", \\"From Yesterday\\", \\"Was It A Dream\\" and the title track.  This is a solid album from beginning to end; there are some great lyrics and for the most part no 2 songs sound very similar.  Originally this album just had 10 tracks, but they've since added 2 hidden tracks; one is the heaviest song on the CD and the other is sort of a spacey electronic track.  The only drag about this CD is that it's copy-protected which means you can't put it on your iPod and can't rip it to your computer.  I really hate that, but I blame the record label for it.<br /><br />I liked this CD so much that I recently went out and picked up the band's first album from 2002.  It's excellent, but they had a pretty different style back then.  They sounded a bit more the way I remembered them in concert...like a slightley industrial version of Chevelle.  It's heavier and a little less radio-friendly than \\"A Beautiful Lie\\", but it's great!  So even if you're like me and you don't care for emo music, you should still consider giving this album a try if you like what you've heard so far.are for emo music, you should still consider giving this album a try if you like what you've heard so far.

B000JBXXZ4|3.0|I'm a pretty huge Incubus fan.  I thought that \\"SCIENCE\\", \\"Make Yourself\\" and \\"Morning View\\" were 3 absolutely flawless albums.  Every song was excellent.  When \\"A Crow Left Of The Murder\\" came out I wasn't as impressed at first because it sounded like a lot of \\"Morning View\\" left-overs.  I've since fallen in love with the album, a few of their best songs are on there, but I didn't like it as much as the 3 previous albums.  I knew the band was going to change their sound, so I kept an open mind when I first popped \\"Light Grenades\\" into my CD player...<br /><br />The album starts off with \\"Quicksand\\" which is just sort of an intro, but it fades right into \\"A Kiss To Send Us Off\\" which is just an absolutely terrific song.  The guitar is in your face, the lyrics are great and the melodies are top-notch.  The next track is \\"Dig\\" and it's another winner.  Beautiful singing and guitar work.  At this point, the album is pretty impressive.  The next song is the album's first single \\"Anna Molly.\\"  I wasn't that impressed when I first heard the song on the radio, musically it sounded a bit too similar to bands like The Strokes who I don't care for.  The song has since grown on me, but it's still not one of their best.  Then the CD's title track is pretty decent, it has a lot of energy...my only complaint is that it has that guitar sound that Mike Einzinger has been using just a bit too much lately.  It sounds good and everything, but I like some variety.  \\"SCIENCE\\" and \\"Make Yourself\\" had tons of different guitar sounds...but it seems that \\"Morning View\\", \\"A Crow Left...\\" and this album have too many songs with that twangy guitar sound.  Any way, I digress.  Another pretty decent song on here is \\"Rogues\\", but every song that I haven't described isn't worth mentioning all that much.  Don't get me wrong, none of the songs on here suck.  It's just that half of this album seems kinda un-inspired, especially compared to their other releases.  They even put 2 versions of \\"Earth To Bella\\" on here and they both sound almost identical, and it's not that strong of a song to begin with.  Aside from about 4 or 5 tracks on here, this album didn't rock out much either.  I'm not saying the band has to go back to being as heavy as they were in the \\"SCIENCE\\" days, but I would like to see some energy.  I really hate posting a negative sounding review on one of my favorite bands, but I'm just trying to give it to you straight.  I still enjoy this CD quite a bit, but out of their last 5 albums, this is probably their weakest.o Bella\\" on here and they both sound almost identical, and it's not that strong of a song to begin with.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|For those who haven't been on the Firefly bandwagon or badgered into watching it by a friend who was, you are definitely missing out on a great although short-lived series.  This series is excellent not only for the fantastic story line but also the incredible depth of individual characters and fantastic acting.   <br /> <br />The entire story is set in space and on various planets on the edge of a \\"civilized\\" federation which is ruling by the choice of a majority but at the same time using somewhat coercive tactics to keep people in line and hiding some rather disturbing skeletons on a deliberately ignored planet.  The story follows the small crew of a smuggling ship, unexpectedly similar in some ways to elements in Star Wars (episodes IV-VI) without most of the irritatingly flashy or silly aspects.  The fact that this ship is scraping by on whatever means are available makes the tone and environment very down to earth.  Many of the \\"outer rim\\" places they land resemble older forms of society which have elements of high technology (types of guns, ships, detection equipment) but also make sets resembling 19th century dance halls or old west towns believable and highly entertaining.  Even more excellent is that the writers did an unbelievable job making the situations full of emotional intensity and occasionally gripping suspense even while finding room for teasing or sarcastic humor.   <br /> <br />The creator and director, Joss Whedon, is also know for *Buffy the Vampire Slayer* and *Angel,* which I have seen various episodes but which are *far exceeded* by *Firefly* in almost every aspect.  This series includes a nearly perfect mix of humor, drama, varied fight scenes (from swords and guns to fistfights and martial arts), engaging and realistic characters, devoted actors, and creative and unique incorporation of elements wholly new and flavorful (like swearing in Chinese?)  It is a great set of shows which can be enjoyed on their own and can also add depth to thefabulous movie *Serenity* which followed and completed some of the hanging story lines from *Firefly* in a superb and satisfying manner.  If you're not familiar with the show, I encourage you to check this out or even watch a friend's.  It's one of the few dvd-on-tv sets I own (along with the West Wing and parts of CSI) and I've never regretted buying it.  Now I understand why the original fans were such die hards and sympathize wholeheartedly that there was only one season.
B00080ZG10|5.0|On one level, this is an interesting and convincing period piece about the times in which Hughes lived and his remarkable accomplishments.  I didn't fully catch onto the filmmakers' ultimate intent though until I watched it a second time:  that is, the gravity of obsessive-compulsive disorder in Hughes' life.  I greatly enjoyed the film the first time I saw it but it wasn't until that second viewing that I realized the power and grittiness of the story they were trying to tell and, for me, the \\"classic\\" status it should/will receive.  The source music really helps set the period and the score by Howard Shore is truly exceptional.  My respect for DiCaprio grew tremendously as well - both for his actual performance and after learning more about his passion for wanting to put this story onscreen and all the work he went to and interest he took in the project.  I don't like using the word \\"epic\\" and often avoid so-called stories that are, but 'The Aviator' is a grand one that has a tone all of its own due to the focus on Hughes' determination and achievements in face of mounting external struggles and even more overwhelming internal ones.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I grew up with the Beatles, own all their CDs, know all their music by heart, so it was with some anticipation/trepidation that I cued up *Love*.  And...wow.  It is surprising, refreshing, delightful.  I'd advise you to set aside the time to just listen to it -- as opposed to having it on as background music.  All original Beatles tapes spun together by father-and-son Martins, with the only newly-created music being Senior's addition of instrumental tracks on \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", which happens to be my favorite track of all time, Beatles or anyone else...and to me it's worth the cost of the CD just to have another version of my favorite song.
B000002KCI|5.0|Zuma is one of the best Neil Young and Crazy Horse discs. Danger Bird and Cortez the killer are two of the best electric songs for Neil Cortez is real impressive. Driveback dont cry no tears Barstool blues lookin for alove are good Both accoustic songs are great Pardon my heart and Through my sails both have good vocals and harmony.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the best television shows that was ever made.  It's a shame that it didn't last more than one season.. but that seems to happen to a lot of shows I grow attached to (Wonderfalls, American Gothic, Miracles- all of which I highly recommend). <br /> <br />Great action, great plot, great characters, great everything.  It just rocks, 'nuff said.
B000002UAR|5.0|Revolver is a great Beatles cd. There is good sound. all the songs are good. Tomorrow never knows is a great eastern song. Im only sleeping and She said she said are great theres really nothing not to like. Revolver is a classic and easy to listen to all the way through

0552998087|1.0|Bill Bryson crosses the line between humorous sarcasm to just plain bitter, hateful commentary on perfectly lovely spots. He greedily latches on to any stereotype available and exploits it. He happily criticizes events and places he doesn't even visit. I'm sorry he had such a miserable childhood and angry relationship with his father, but I don't think that justifies trashing an entire country. To Bill, I offer sympathies for a sorrowful youth that has obviously left deep an painful scars even well into his adult years. <br /> <br />I'm so sad to have spent money on this book. I loved Bryson's Walk in the Woods, and hope to enjoy the Sunburned Country. But the Lost Continent is going in the trash.
B000G73UEU|5.0|The beauty of this production is that one can sense that the artists singing really believe in the poetry..a splendid and deeply felt rendition of Leonard Cohen's moving work.

B000GPI2EK|1.0|For starters, I know most folks go ape for this band, and I'm not giving it a bad review just to bash on 'hipster metal' or something. I've listened to all kinds of underground music and metal for 20 years, and I can honestly say this is one of the worst albums i have ever heard. The vocalist is terrible, just shouting out the lyrics, which are meant to come across as deep and insightful, but are really just a mish-mash of words that make zero sense. The guitarwork is extremely weak; most of the time they just pick the same few notes over and over. And then there's the drummer, who seems to think the album is one long drum solo. I like flashy drum work, but this guy completely overruns the album. He's constantly playing at twice the speed of the rest of the band, which makes the songs incredibly grating to listen to. In closing, I'd say don't buy the hype surrounding this band, as this is a truly dismal record. If you want a good slice of hipster metal, check out The Sword's 'age of winters', and let this Mastodon go extinct as soon as possible
0446528056|4.0|Got this for my wife who is the book reader in the family, she likes the book a lot, a must have she says.
B000KC8O3S|5.0|Minutes after watching the first episode of season one, I knew I wanted this soundtrack. It's been awhile in coming, but totally worth it! You not only get music from season one, but also season two and the Christmas special.  <br /> <br />I'm not a music critic, so I can't say much about the technical accomplishments (or problems). I do love instrumental soundtracks, and this is just one of the best, most epic soundtracks I've heard in a while.  <br /> <br />Fans should know: This version of \\"Song for Ten\\" is different from the show. It takes a little getting used to, but the additional lyrics  add a special poignancy to the song considering how the second season ended.  <br /> <br />The only (small) problem I'll nitpick is that over 31 tracks the music can sometimes get slightly repetitive. But overall this has to be one of the best TV soundtracks I've ever purchased. Thank you, BBC, for finally making this available.
B000IONJH4|4.0|Good old space classic to enjoy, a nice one to enjoy for something different.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|This film is a myth. 1925-1927 in Germany was a crucial period. The depression was going to arrive soon with its unemployment, financial catastrophe, and nazism. All that is clearly reflected in the film. There are two levels in this city, the underground level for factories and the working class, and the top level for business people, politicians and other privileged people. The latter dance, feast, do nothing but enjoy what other people under them create and produce. This vision of a world cut in two social classes is quite common in those days though today it sounds a little bit schematic. In these days everything was either black or white. The trick in the film is that the son of the ruler of this metropolis falls in love with a certain Maria from underground who preaches the coming of some kind of Messiah to establish peace and freedom for all. She preaches in the catacombs exclusively to working class people. She represents some hope and patience. But it all runs afoul when the ruler decides to get rid of his main counselor and to encourage his inventor to kidnap this Maria to use her face on the inventor's robot. This robot then goes down underground and preaches rebellion and destruction. The real Maria, with the help of the ruler's son and his fired main counselor will save all the children trapped in the underground city and will catch up on the crowd of working class people looking for vengeance in the name of their supposedly lost children. Luckily the good news will change the atmosphere, though not the fate of the false Maria who is already burning at the stake, which reveals she is nothing but a robot. Then the inventor had managed to recapture the real Maria and the ruler's son runs after them. The inventor will be defeated, Maria saved and some kind of peace reestablished between the leader/foreman of the working class and the ruler of the metropolis, thanks to the intermission of the ruler's son who appears to be the Messiah or go-between they were waiting for. The interest of the film here is that it is messianic because it foresees what is going to happen though it tries to avoid it or preach a middle way between the two extremes. We have to think of H.G. Wells and his Time Machine. The two worlds are not incompatible, just not able to communicate any more. The solution, the way out is for Fritz Lang the possibility to communicate again for these two classes, with a strong common ground which is found in some kind of christian inspiration mainly from the Book of Revelation. But the main interest of the film is technical. It is a film that associates some kind of animation, the filming of pictures, images and objects, and the filming of real characters in the setting that these images represent. For the period it was very advanced and some of the special effects necessary for the depicting of the machines, the factories and the collapse of the underground city are extremely fascinating in spite of their rudimentary nature. It is also a mute film and the acting is extremely expressive, even if the quantity of text is rather important. The point is that the acting is probably just as expressive as Charlie Chaplin or Buster Keaton, but not in a comic direction, rather in a very tragic and dramatic way. These actors and actresses are able to really express feelings only with their body language. The best case is the main actress who plays both the real Maria and the false Maria. She manages to contrast the two parts perfectly and only with her body language. Some of the visions contained in this film have since been used by many other filmmakers and imitated or even copied by many fiction writers. We should also note the music which accompanies this film. It is slightly repetitive but keeps some liveliness and originality.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonnewaiting for.

B000K7UG20|5.0|Great Cop movie that takes you over sea's, you will enjoy it from start to finish...get it
B000068OCS|5.0|The images in Koyaanisqatsi portray \\"mass technology as the environment of life.\\" There is a meditative quality as image and music create a fusion of nature and city life. There is an undercurrent of loneliness, as if the humans walking through these settings have lost some deep memory of a tribal life where people felt more connected and cared for. The name of the film means \\"life out of balance\\" and is a word from the Hopi language.<br /><br />After a brief viewing of cave paintings we are taken on a journey where clouds summersault through the sky or rush through mountains like sky rivers. There is a stark contrast between the aging of the earth, which brings even more beauty to the world (mountains, jagged peaks) and the disintegration of buildings which scars the landscape. Perfectly still lakes present mesmerizing beauty while cities at first seem poetic and serene, then turn chaotic.<br /><br />Some of the images are profoundly moving, like when you look into the eyes of people who seem lost or when viewing a bomb-testing site in the background and a tree dying in the foreground, completely deformed.<br /><br />Humor is sometimes present when the pictures are sped up, although they seem to imply a hungry consumer culture. There are a few images of people on a beach, but most of the images seem to be implying that people are isolating themselves and destroying a serene beauty enjoyed by cultures more in tune with a natural flow of life.<br /><br />Electronic music creates a pleasant background that merges as easily with scenes from nature as the organization of a city and a computer chip. In this artistic dance of machine and music there is still a lot to think about and while survival is always a universal factor, how we want to live in the future is a question we have to ask ourselves today.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
B000KGGLCU|5.0|I like the music in this collection, the DVD attached it also worth watching as well. I must confess I pick and choose on her work, but for some reason this one stuck out and is a keeper. If you like \\" Madonna\\" you should enjoy this for your music collection.
B000NDDHG8|5.0|Here's the track listing: 1. Baby Please Don't Go 2. She's Got Balls 3. Little Lover 4. Stick Around 5. Soul Stripper 6. You Ain't Got A Hold Of Me 7. Love Song 8. Show Business
B000FGG60W|2.0|Not sure what I was expecting but it was a let down as far as the movie goes, would not suggest to other to spend the bucks on this one.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I first borrowed this series from a \\"Browncoat\\" office worker friend. I loved it right away. My 13 and 8 year old also loved it...they couldn't get enough of it (albeit some episodes are a little on the racey side....almost as good as Cinemax at midnite...). Anyway, my wife doesn't get in to sci-fi, and she started watching it with us as well. After about 3-4 episodes, we were scolded for getting her hooked. She loves Soaps :( , and the drama in these episodes is 10 times better than any soap....not to mention very humorous as well.  <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor, buy it and watch them. You will NOT be disappointed!
B000GW8VTO|4.0|Well done, this is a good one to watch for those of us who like war type movies. Worth the expense and will be a nice addition to your collection.
B0006MT314|4.0|This is a great CD! I love listening to it in the car, before bed and at work. A lot of great songs, but I must say the second soundtrack is the best! I feel they are both must have in your collection.
B000FZEQS2|4.0|Good movie to have and stay with, both main actors are a real classic, will make for a good collection addition.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|Well, what can I say.  Mary Poppins was my alltime favorite movie as a child.  Although I never actually owned it, I had watched it in Day Care and seen it in the theatres.  I may just have to buy it now that it's on DVD.  It has some of my favorite songs.  Sometimes I catch myself singing \\"A Spoonful of Sugar,\\" while doing my sidework at the restaurant where I work.  It is a great work song.
B000G0O5N2|3.0|First let me say that this is one of my favorite movies.  I own both the standard DVD and Blu-ray formats.  After watching \\"The Corpse Bride\\" I was expecting the world.  Admittingly, this was not a fair comparison, as \\"The Corpse Bride\\" is an animated movie.  Visually I was not totally impressed.  On first viewing, I felt as though I was watching a standard signal through an HDTV.    Hardware: Playstation 3, Sharp Aquos, using an HDMI connection.  Hopefully my option will change after watching it again.      I watched this movie a second time and now would like to change my opinion.  The 3d effects are not as great as in Crank, but they are still very good.  The artifacts that I think I might have been mentioning in my previous viewing might have just been style items from the movie as I didn't see many in the second viewing.  This time around, I actually noticed things that I had not even picked up in any viewing (actors who are in the movie, scenes shots where people are present that I didn't recall before, etc.)  I would like to give this movie another star but it won't let me.  If you can't decide if you should get this movie or not, get it.  The blu-ray visual effects and sound add to an already great story.
B00000269G|5.0|Great Music, haven't listened to George Shearing for many years, it was an absolute delight to listen to his unique technic with the paino. <br /> <br />I'm really impressed, it was as good to listen George's music last week, as it was, when I was first itroduced to his music all those years ago. <br /> <br />I will derive many hours of pleasure listening this album.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|This motion picture  (DVD) is what I call a REAL Go-to-Sea, Action movie. <br />Master and Commander is a CLASSIC look at life aboard a ship-of-war at the dawnings of the 19th century Napoleonic Wars.  Russell Crowe is superb in his role as Capt Jack Aubrey.  But I would think that 13-year old Max Pirkis as Midshipman Lord Blakeney, came neigh close to stealing the entire show!  He is marvelous and for his feat of rendering an endearing and sensitive portrayal of the courageous one-armed Boy-Officer, this movie rates 5-stars. Pirkis is fabulous!  Oh yes, do not forget to CRY when his best boyhood friend, Midshipman Calamy is killed in battle.  It is a VERY sad scene which will haunt the viewer for a long time.  <br /> <br />The VISUAL effects are second to none as are the audio effects.  You actually SEE what late 18th century/early 19th century solid shot 12-lb cannon balls can do to a ship and what they do NOT do.  The sounds are remarkable!  A must buy DVD! <br /> <br />
B00005ASHM|5.0|Everyone else here seems to be doing it, so here I go.  First, I think the title of greatest album and greatest rock album are totally different.  Pet Sounds does not rock as much as the Beatles albums thrown into this discussion (Rubber Soul, Revolver, SGT Pepper).  Of those, I'd say Revolver rocks the most, easily earning the title of greatest rock album.  Then you've got Pet Sounds and Sgt. Pepper .....bringing new sounds and concepts into popular music, wonderfully orchestrated.  I consider both of these to be art more than rock, though they do have their moments.  I'd call it a toss up, if it werent for the one track that stands outside of the \\"performance\\" of SGT Pepper's LHCB.....A Day in the Life.  That album closer is enough to push SGT Pepper over the edge as the greatest (general) music album ever recorded.  As much of a genius as Brian Wilson was, he was no substitute for the combined creative efforts of John, Paul, George, and Ringo.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! It was hilarious and at the same time got you thinking about our society today in this country. What a wonderful departure from the usual Hollywood fare.
B000002UDB|5.0|I think this album gets a bad reputation because it is more a collection of songs than an album....though they somehow fit into a more druggy, post-SGT Pepper theme.  Even though recorded right around, and in some cases, during, the SGT Pepper sessions, none of these songs would fit with that album.   <br /> <br />So why 5 stars?  The songs are great.  The only one that I've grown tired of is All You need is Love.  That being said, I'm glad that this was pretty much the end of the Beatles' psychadelic phase.  Its clear that they had exhausted that aspect of their music, and it was time to move on to different things (White Album, Abbey Road, etc).......yes, better things.  Still enjoyable, still 5 stars, but The Beatles just kept changing and rewriting the history of music.  Oh, and listen to this album in MONO.  The mix is far superior.
B000KCHZK6|1.0|I liked one song - \\"Wake Me Up\\".  This album strays from the entrancing melodies of her previous albums, it's just not pleasing to the ear [at least not to mine].  Even more disappointing was her choice to insert a political statement.  Regardless of whether I agree with her political views or not, politics needn't pollute every aspect of life, I wish she'd left that out.
B000FDFVZ6|5.0|In the little time I have available to read, this is the one book I picked.  It's one of my favorites because you get to feel so close to the narrator, of Susie Salmon, she's like a long lost friend you really miss. <br /> <br />It was hard to put this book down, as the other review said, and I was also a bit disappointed toward the end---only probably because I wanted more detail about what happened to Susie's attacker.  Nevertheless, this was one of the last really good books I read.

B000J10EQU|4.0|I was skeptical when I found out that they were planning to do another movie on Superman.  First of all, I thought why would they want to continue the sagas without Christopher Reeve?  I remember watching Superman in 1978 and Superman II in 1980 and thinking that nothing else could ever top those movies (especially with the disapointment of Superman III and Quest for Peace).  I thought that they have done enough and just leave the series alone.<br /><br />When I went to see this one, I was happily suprised to find that they used the music from the original sagas and that they didn't try to outdo the original series but pay homage to them and tell a different account of Superman.  Brandon Routh is a great Superman (unfortunately it will leave him typecast for the rest of his career), Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane is excellent (and she is so SEXY!), and Kevin Spacey as Lex Luther was great (wouldn't it been fun to see Gene Hackman as Lex Luther Sr.?) Anyways, great special effects, a good plot the story, and believeable characters.  I think Christopher Reeve would of been pleased with this rendition of Superman.<br /><br />Recommended!
0375831002|5.0|This is a compelling novel that I just could not put down.  The book is extremely well written.  I felt as if I was transported back in time to Nazi Germany and got to see that period of history through the eyes of death.
B000MG1YBG|5.0|Today I received the just released Mika CD. I hit mute on my television, left my laptop humming and listened to the whole disk, and it was easy to do. This kid's got that special something. I pre-purchased his CD after I saw his \\"Grace Kelly\\" video on the music television channel.<br /><br />I was very pleased that all of the songs that I heard were obviously by the same artist that produced Grace Kelley. I say that because sometimes you hear a song, it's great, you get the whole album and that song just happened to be a different flavor than the rest of the work. This was all Mika flavor! I was also impressed to see his name next to every song \\"written by Mika\\". Only a couple had co-writers.<br /><br />So Mika has an amazing range, he hits the most beautiful cascading highs, and drops into whispery billowing lows. What ever his formula is, it's perfect. He has found a place that is refreshing and downright charming to hear.<br /><br />-Grace Kelly: exhibits this range perfectly, its fun and epic at the same time which isn't always possible. This is effective much in the way that the song \\"I believe in a thing called love\\" by Darkness, but without the metal edge or dated feeling. Mika carries his whimsy in a completely modern tone - while still occasionally evoking the feelings of retro Broadway stylings. Grace Kelly is a perfect work of art.<br /><br />-Lollipop: fun banter, feels like frolicking in a parade.<br /><br />-My Interpretation: Soft and inviting yet with a surprisingly powerful chorus. The piano lulls you but before you know it you have been carried off into a state of heightened buildup that you only notice when you are returned again to the piano.<br /><br />-Love Today: A modern number, Mika's high voice floats and seemingly dances over heavy pulsing drums while it sways back and forth into a strong street corner like bullhorn spoken word (think Beck's \\"Where It's At\\").<br /><br />-Relax: Unlike it's title, this song is a sad song that is trying to relax. It is almost as if we are taken inside his head while he self talks himself into comfort, at one point it feels as though he has transitioned from himself to speaking these words of acceptance to someone else.<br /><br />-Any Other World: Begins with a woman's monologue that speaks of love gone wrong, losing an eye and never loving a man again. Mika's voice soft and rich (like chocolate) voice stretches over the singing piano that plays in short and quick strokes evoking the flutterings of butterfly wings, it begins to blossom as the song rises slowly with heavy strings, resulting in a beautiful power, that strengthens his words. The strings descend into the short flitters we initially heard, charging the variable of emotions. This song could be taken in one of two ways, staying in an unhealthy relationship means leaving your original childlike dreams of the world you used to live, or it could mean leaving the relationship to enter into a new world without the pain of the relationship. A matter of perspective I suppose. Either way, the song ends where it began.<br /><br />-Billy Brown: A perky jingle about a man with a wife, children and a dog who falls in love with a man. Interesting, would have liked to hear a little more emotion about the main character, but I commend him for covering this content. For love is love.<br /><br />-Big Girls: Starts out so cute with the slurping of a straw! This song's content reminds me of Queens \\"Fat Bottom Girls\\" I respect the ode to diversity, as in the last track all the varied beauty in the world is appreciated. And I appreciate that for indeed beauty comes in all shapes and sizes.<br /><br />-Stuck in the Middle: The sweetest melody strung together with the highest of the high voice sprawling over a heavy beat. This song ponders a relationship, and the presence and depth of where to go, stuck in the middle. I like the piano that floods in like cabaret at the end mixed with very nice and improv sounding vocals.<br /><br />-Happy Ending: It begins with an alluring multiple voice intro, and Miko's melancholy voice especially with those sweeping \\"I's\\" is immediate in it's infectious beauty, causing you to fall in love with it's bittersweet sound. The song multiplies itself lending to more and more power, you know right away that it will be a song you will love.<br /><br />----Now here is the tricky part, if you look at the song directory on the back of the CD it appears as though the next song is a bonus track called Ring Ring, but before you get to that you will remain on track 10 which was the last song, you will hear a strangely long amount of silence, hang in there, don't skip to the next song, because there while eventually arise another section of track ten \\"Over My Shoulder\\". To simplify, \\"Happy Ending\\" and \\"Over My Shoulder\\" are both on track ten, with a very long break of silence in between. But it is so worth the wait!!!<br /><br />-Over My Shoulder: The most amazing track, it is so lovely that you almost feel as though you are in Church, his voice is slow and echoes profoundly with such sweet perfection. He delivers into space with such control that you feel you are in the presence of something holy or royal. There is only the slightest landscape of sound that his voice cascades over. I love this track, it is magic.<br /><br />-Ring Ring: the bonus track, fun and confident \\"leave me alone!\\" it's upbeat adventure ends abruptly, I found that interesting.<br /><br />All and All - Mika not only lived up to the wonderful song that prompted me to buy his album but there were many more wonderful surprises. I felt like a kid in a candy shop, like I just saw a Broadway play, or visited Willy Wonka, it is indeed otherworldly and I will be visiting a lot.<br /><br />Mika is a super talent with a wonderful ability to convey a strong but ethereal sense of being that swallows up every song in his unique wrapper. He has his own voice, and while I mean that literally I also mean it figuratively. I love this album, it's fresh but mature in construction.

I thought is was my DVD player, but when I played it again on another player it did exactly the same thing.  I returned this & Amazon quickly sent me another one.  Again the DVD skipped a whole scene.  Frustrated I wanted my money back.  Evidently, the manufacter of this Dune DVD never bother to check quality of it's product.

B000MZHW40|3.0|OK movie loses credibility by having every african character speak english and having hundreds of bullets evading the heroes, even when everbody else around them gets hit.  Hard to believe Oscar voters nominated DeCaprio in this film over his performance on \\"The Departed\\". Doesn't make much sense that him and Hounsou would both get nominated here when they spend 90% of the movie screaming at each other's faces from exactly one inch apart.  Not the worst action movie but unfortunately, by having watched it the very next day after \\"Last king of Scotland\\", it's Hollywood nature felt all the more obvious to me.
B000FVQM2Y|3.0|This movie has it all, on paper at least.  A great premise, a talented cast, great shots plus all the intrigue and mystery of a great film.  To me where it falls short is the script.   <br />To me the dialog is trying to be WAY smarter than it is.  Which to me is the most frustrating about this movie.  This might be how Shakespeare would write dialog if he was a modern day 17 year old douchebag.  The dialog just confuses an already complex mystery of who is allied with who and what each character's true motives are.  I see a review that says the dialog is \\"hard-boiled lingo that's both comic and poetic\\", no it is just contrived and boring. <br />While the some of the actors really suprised me with their great performances. The characters in this film don't ever get the depth and backstory each deserves and for this I think the movie suffers.  To me the thin characters make me think this was maybe written by someone in high school.   <br />Beyond all the faults, I still was interested until the end.  Once I suspended belief in the plot & characters I got past the dialog I still was watching and was glad I saw it. <br />I think it is worth a view, maybe on rental 1st, because it is not for everyone.

1400079179|3.0|Most of the 60,000,000 readers of this book may not reaize that Dan Brown was one of the first Spammers - with a capitol S. I kid you not. Back in the day, when I first reviewed books here at Amazon, I received an email signed by the man himself - DB. Something to the effect that he had seen my review of a particular book and \\"knew\\" that I would just \\"love\\" his first time effort - \\"Digital Fortress\\". Ever eager to try something new, I did - and panned it! Much like The Da Vinci Code, it was formulaic, predictable and altogether lacking in the prerequisites of the genre - well developed characters that elicit some emotion on the part of the reader. Not to talk about the inane dialogue that is so much a part his books. Pretty much all of it actually as he tends to substitute such dialogue for what other authors deem to be necessary descriptive prose.<br /><br />To the book. Several years ago I read a wonderfully intriguing book - \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\\". Now well known, it was not so in the US at the time. Irreverent and bold, it posited theories that tickled the mind. One time, I had occasion to ask Umberto Eco his thoughts on the subject matter. His response - \\"Bullsh$t!\\". Of course, but fun nonetheless. And fun is what so lacking in the books of DB. The man just doesn't get it! Then again, he's the \\"bestseller\\", non Sophie?<br /><br />I have read that this book is required reading in some US colleges. What is going on here people? Does the success of this book personify our aspirations in terms of \\"a good read\\"? Or is it just part of a great conspiracy.<br /><br />Lastly - who ever heard of a screen door in Scotland?
0618680004|5.0|Firstly, I want to \\"thank\\" Mr. Dawkins for what is a superb rendering regarding an inhuman system of legend, myth, psychosis, and hatred; that being organized religion, in every form.     Mr. Dawkins-- as an author has eloquently stated the rational as to why we (humankind) are overflowing with war, hatred, murder, misunderstanding, and more; the etiologies of these maladies are simply put: organized religion and those men and women that control and perpetuate the aspects of such.      Mr. Dawkins clearly and objectively states why humankind must move beyond the insane \\"delusions\\" of religion.  Additionally he plainly delineates the damage these systems have caused to us as a species, and continue to cause; including the assault on the basic civil rights of mankind.         As far as the book \\"The God Delusion\\" is concerned (I purchased the unabridged CD), it is a work of sheer provocative BRILLANCE (I fully intend to purchase the hard copy for my collection)!  The God Delusion is possibly the most significant book of our time.      Mr. Dawkins is the type of person I would want to be in a government position, he is  fair and decent.     This book is a must-read to all opened-minded citizens of the world.  It is a work of pure GENIUS, I loved it!  Thanks again Mr. D.
B000JJS8TM|3.0|Don't waste your money on the CD/DVD two-fer, which is ridiculous. The \\"DVD\\" is just a duplicate of the audio disc with a severely lame graphics display tacked on. Can't imagine why they bothered.

076531178X|5.0|This was the first Sanderson novel I've read. I have to say I found a new author to keep tabs on. I'm definitely going to pick up Elantris and can't wait for the second Mistborn to come out. His characters are enjoyable and you can really get into them. The world he created is somewhat complicated when it comes to the metals people can store and use as powers, but he describes it in such a way that its really easy to understand. And, his fight scenes are really easy to follow and envision in your mind. The book lagged in some parts but that happens sometimes. It didn't happen enough to warrent four stars though. If you're looking for a new fantasy author or take on fantasy, give this guy a try. You won't be disappointed.
B000H30B2C|5.0|It is a shame that this beautiful remake of one of the all time great movies in history did not get any recognition, or a ton of Oscars. The characters were all very well developed, the storyline nicely enhanced, and the emotional range of this timeless story was beautifully executed. The only minor objection was the over long and totally unbelievable section, when they were all running in a herd of Brontosauruses, as if they all would not have been crushed to death. And the insect scene, although aptly instilling a greater fear for this mysterious Island, might have been a bit too much, but that all sinks into oblivion when the whole movie takes over your senses and emotions and gives it a great adventurous ride of a lifetime. GREAT! BRAVO!
0743517814|5.0|This is a fantastically researched book with an amazing array of facts about wealth in America. Now that it is on audio, there's no excuse for not learning about this information that is revealing and entertaining.    If you are interested in learning specific information about joining the ranks of the millionaires next door, you may want to read any book from Mike Kiyosaki (Rich Dad, Poor Dad series), and \\"The 17 Principles of Creating Wealth,\\" by Phillip Collinsworth.
B000002VRZ|3.0|This CD is loaded with lots of Outlaw favorites. I happen to be one who has always found \\"Waterhole\\" and \\"Knoxville Girl\\" relatively unappreciated on the grand scale of Outlaw songs, and their presnce on this CD is a must. The same can be said about Outlaw anthems \\"Green Grass and High Tides; There Goes Another Love Song\\" and \\"Freeborn Man.\\" But this collection has gone further in years to dig up other favorites. I was delighted to see \\"Take It Any Way You Want It; You Are The Show\\" and \\"Ghost Riders in the Sky\\" represented. But perhaps a more up to date collection is in order. Granted, the band see-sawed line-up wise in it's latter years, as did the subsequent music they produced. But \\"Hurry Sundown\\" alone is worthy of more representation on this CD. The late 70s saw the remaining bands of both southern rock and the California sound (Eagles/ Poco, etc.) hit their zenith in production and music  produced. It's no coincidence to some degree, as \\"Hurry Sundown's\\" producer did the same for the Eagle's \\"Hotel California\\" resulting in more refined, streamlined music that had crossover appeal. And \\"Hurry Sundown's\\" \\"Holiday; So Afraid\\" and \\"Heavenly Blue\\" each are worthy of being present on a conmprehensive Outlaws collection, as are cuts from future CDs like \\"Los Hombres Malo\\" and \\"In The Eye of the Storm,\\" though they may be fewer in number. But, this is a best of CD. And to accomplish what I feel is necessary, an anthology is in order. The Outlaws may not have ranked up there with the Allmans, the Skynards or the Tuckers in mass appeal. But they did have quite a run for what many consider a not as consequential southern rock band. And their life span is certainly worthy of an anthology to be a more truly comprehensive look at a band that left its mark.
B0007MWZEK|3.0|This does an amazing job sweeping.  My kids love it, so they sweep after meals.  This is all good.  The problem is the quality is so low as to render the sweeper disposable. <br /> <br />If the same mechanism was built by Leifheit, or some other quality brand, this sweeper would rock.  As it is, I can't see buying a new one every 3-4 months for $30 a pop.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|The DVD of the concert is perfect. I saw the concert on the floor of Madison Square Garden but even being as close as I was, I still missed many of the nuances. I am able to see them all here and it's amazing. This is Madonna's most creative concert, the Girlie Show being her most fun, but there is plenty of fun here too!!! The CD is good but why Madonna decided to include two boring interludes, the Sorry Remix and the ULTRA boring Confessions of the dancer's lives is beyond comprehension. Who wants to hear three dancers talk about their poor lives and how they have overcome them on a live CD of Madonna's music???? I would rather hear Live to Tell and speaking of Live to Tell in the cncert; so happy to see it here uncut. I love the message of Live to Tell and love the controversy it created. As usual with Madonna, perfection all the way!!!!
B000KCHZK6|4.0|Norah Jones is one of the first new performer/songwriters worthy of a spot in my \\"desert island\\" bag.  She is still growing musically, and it's true, some of her songs sound alike, but at least she has the courage and TALENT to write her own, and not simply recycle old songs.  If you are \\"bored\\" with the songs, try listening to the lyrics and the orchestrations.  I look forward to many future endeavors.
B00008GKEG|5.0|This disk set was worth every penny.  For the true Beatles fan who was just entering the world of music during changing times, this set will bring back floods of memories.  The home movies and never before broadcast (in the US) interviews gives you the feeling you are a fly on the wall.  It was great seeing the 1996 reunion with the Paul, George and Ringo.  Hearing and seeing them sitting around talking about the past was great.  Watching them adding their own marks to John's recording of FREE AS A BIRD was a reminder of just how well they really were together.  It was as if John had written it for just that purpose.  Hearing all together again takes you back. <br /> <br />Anyone who liked their music, loved watching them evolve and mourned their breakup will really enjoy Beatles Anthology.
B0001GMIOE|5.0|The lack of an active sensor-LCD display on a D-SLR, among other things, means that I can take around four hundred pictures with this camera before recharging the battery. Flash, continual focusing, burst-- nothing seems to faze this battery. I want to get the battery grip so I can take a few thousand pictures at once... that'd be sweet.<br /><br />I hope it holds up. I've only had it for a few weeks... my NB-1LH for my trusty Powershot S500 has only just begun to show a noticeable decrease in the charge it holds, and I've had that camera for almost three years...
B000BHHVPO|4.0|To be honest, I purchsed this set for two reasons. 1. I had already gotten the 1985 version, and why not have both? 2. (the most important) Pink Floyd is back together again, and as one poster said: \\"Pink Floyd back together again? - and they said Pigs don't fly\\". There are extras using them as well. The rest of the performers were an added bonus as far as I was concerned, and the cause is awesome. Both of these Live 8 sets are treasures and testamonies to the era in which we live. My children were born in the early 80's, so they also enjoy seeing the performers from both sets.
B00005JMUA|5.0|The questions raised by the first chapter are answered. I actually liked this volume better than the first - it's a nailbiter, humorous yet morose, and I love the old kung fu movie style present in many scenes. It's also more personal - the bride will have her revenge.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Al Gore does a great job of giving us the facts and figures for conditions today.  He not only presents the evidence, but also presents proof to back up the evidence.  When I first saw that this was a video of a lecture on global warming, I thought I would be disappointed, but Al Gore not only makes the lecture enjoyable, he also adds in life experiences and puts a new light on the importance of our environment and the people who not only are here today, but will be here when our children are grown.<br /><br />This is not 96 minutes of lecture, it is a combination of facts mixed in with personal memories and experiences that may seem at first to be just propaganda, but in reality tie back in with the importance of Al Gore's mission.<br /><br />I wish everyone would watch this movie and recognize that as a whole, the people can prevent loss of life and prevent loss of resources and secure a future for generations to come.  Maybe it is too late to stop global warming from happening completely, but just maybe enough can be done to lessen the harmful effects and slow it down a little.<br /><br />My son is 9 yrs old and my daughter is 18 months old....I want them to enjoy the world as they get older and not have to deal with the mess that we have made.  Please watch and try to make a difference.
B00000I3JO|5.0|I always thought of myself as being pretty much in touch with a large variety of music. How could I have not heard of The Blue Nile?  I'm not even sure how I stumbled across this phenominal sound in the past month... <br />    Upon hearing two or three cuts from this CD, I immediately ordered it, and High, Peace At Last and A Walk Across the Rooftops. Hat's is definately my favorite of all four. All are great though.  No other band has instantly soared to the very top of my All Time Favorite Bands list.  <br />    All the reviews I read of this cd were right on the money. I too am reminded of Bruce when hearing some songs.  I am moved to tears when I listen to Let's Go Out Tonight. Paul Buchanan's soulful voice is so gut wrenchingly beautiful, it DOES touch the very core of my soul. Even my 16 year old daughter requested that I burn some songs onto a disc for her...and that speaks volumes to me.  <br />    I regret that I didn't hear about The Blue Nile when they first emerged; but what a priceless buried treasure I have just discovered.   <br /> <br />
B000002U82|4.0|What Pink Floyd is attempting to say is immesurable by normal human standerds. This can explain why, not everyone understands them. Well at least alot of the people I know. Anyway to hear themyou must open your heart not only your mind and let their message about selfishness and society in.  <br />Their great accomplishments on this C.D. are, \\"Time, Money, Brain Damage and Eclipse\\". In these songs, they sum up their beliefs, and it some ways you get the feeling that they are saying we are destructive towards ourselves and so many other life forms on this planet, but still there is hope. <br />This C.D. is very touching.

B00000I2PG|5.0|ABC's the Lexicon of Love is the ultimate Valentine's Day album, a pop masterpiece, a thinking (and pretty funny) man's disco party. That man is lead singer Martin Fry -- a silver-tongued devil in a gold lame suit. <br /> <br />What makes the CD so great is the juxtaposition of the glittering sheen of the music with Fry's head-spinningly witty, sarcastic, and self-aware lyrics. \\"More puns and allusions than Elvis Costello had managed in a career,\\" says Spin Magazine in its Alternative Record Guide, and it's no overstatement.  <br /> <br />Here's some of the best quotes on a CD full of em:  <br /> <br />1. \\"If you judge a book by its cover/then you judge the look by the lover.\\" <br /> <br />2. \\"Look but don't touch in paradise/Don't let them catch you damaging the merchandise.\\" <br /> <br />3. \\"Everything is temporary, written on that stand/Looking for the girl who meets supply with demand.\\" <br /> <br />4. \\"I stuck a marriage proposal in the waste disposal.\\" <br /> <br />5. \\"No I won't be told, there's a crock of gold/at the end of the rainbow. All the pleasure and pain, sunshine and rain/might make this love grow.\\" <br /> <br />6. \\"Skip the hearts and flowers, skip the ivory towers.\\" <br /> <br />7. \\"I get sales talk from sales assistants/When all I want to do, girl, is lower your resistance.\\" <br /> <br />8. \\"When she's gone all I've got to learn/is the law of diminishing returns.\\"   <br /> <br />9. \\"The 12 disciples might kiss and tell/But you can tell me much more than they can.\\" <br /> <br />10. \\"Then I say I love you, foul the situation/Hey, girl, I thought we were the right combination.\\" <br /> <br />Woo-hoo! <br /> <br />At first blush, the thing that stands out is the music, specifically Trevor Horn's impeccable production. Xylophones, glockenspiels, synths, a string section, cash registers, and probably a couple of kitchen sinks, are the order of the day.  <br /> <br />The smooth production is probably what got ABC (mistakenly) lumped in with Spandau Ballet and Wang Chung back in the day, which was maybe part of the joke. Fry's bitchy Vegas-singer-with-a-brain shtick points to satire, but it says something about the quality of the writing that these songs also pack an emotional wallop.   <br /> <br />The big hits here are the Look of Love and Poison Arrow, great songs both, but for my money the overblown orchestrations on All of My Heart, the happy ca-ching of the cash registers on Date Stamp, the opening fanfare of Show Me, and (of course) the Mr. Roboto intro (\\"Evil!\\") on 4 Ever 2 Gether\\" make these tracks equally deserving of your time.  <br /> <br />ABC has never had an album as good as this one, but fans should check out Be Near Me, Between You and Me, Ocean Blue, How to be a Millionaire, and 15-Storey Halo (on the underrated How to be a Zillionaire CD), When Smokey Sings (the band's tribute to Smokey Robinson from the Alphabet City CD), and That Was Then, but This is Now (from the otherwise awful Beauty Stab CD).    <br /> <br />If you like this CD, I also recommend the Divine Comedy's \\"Casanova\\" and the Magnetic Fields' \\"69 Love Songs.\\"
0060764899|4.0|Does anyone like fiction books, if so this book is for you? <br />The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe are about four kids called Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy who move from London, England because air raids. They were sent to an old professor, which they now live in the heart of the country. It was a rainy day so they played a game and happens to fall upon a wardrobe. They entered it and came to a new world called Narnia. Which they don't know that they are the sons and daughters of Adam and Eve. And they have to defeat the White Witch to restore peace to Narnia. <br /> I recommend The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe for children 8 and older.

B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|When I first saw the movie, I thought, Wow. That's really beautiful. The second time I saw it, I paid more attention to the soundtrack and I realized that it was lovely. It really is pretty, mostly piano and strings. There are a few dance tunes on this album from their dances in the movie, and that adds a lot. You really get the feel of what it's like and suddenly you want to hop and dance around.<br /><br />Then you have the piano pieces. Each one fits its scene perfectly, complementing it in the best way any soundtrack can. That's really the most important thing about a soundtrack. It needs to make you think of the movie, and it needs to add to the movie. In this case, both are true. The movie would feel empty without the soundtrack and the soundtrack makes me think of the movie every time I hear it.<br /><br />Then again, there is one issue. While it's very beautiful, it's also slightly bland. The music isn't particularly interesting. If you're looking for exciting score music, this REALLY isn't your soundtrack. I'd suggest turning to John Williams for something like that. However, if you're looking for the beautiful soundtrack that accompanied this lovely movie, you must buy this and enjoy the movie everywhere you go, just by hearing its music.
B0000A0DRY|5.0|From the first time I played this C.D. and truly listened to it while in Trinidad, to now i can only say this. This C.D. is for those that want to feel rapturous. I can safely say for myself that many times I have been doleful and this cd has brought a smile to my face. Many of those sad moments i have spent lamenting, have been turned into moments of playful silliness. I recommend \\"Surrealistic Pillow\\" for all those that want to feel free.

1891252089|4.0|I bought this book when I read an article in a Melbourne newspaper from Antonia Kidman who swore by this manual.  I have a few other Yoga books, both good, but this bound, hardcover manual is very practical as attested to by other reviewers. <br /> <br />I only dropped a point due to the fact (and other Yoga books I have seen don't seem to emphasize this either) that the reader does not really gain an insight into how long it should take them to be able to realize these poses.  Many of the poses, even in the Primary Series could take the average person years of practise to perfect.  We all know Yoga is a lifetime journey but one tends to feel a little incompetent when after practising for some time that they are still struggling with what would be elementary poses for many Yogi's. <br /> <br />That said, take your time and perhaps concentrate on the Sun Salutations and the 30 and 45 minutes sequences to begin with and as you progress and become more flexible you can begin to concentrate on the more advanced asana's.  This book should last you for a long time.
1400064287|5.0|This interesting book elaborates on \\"The Tipping Point\\" by Gladwell and uses a similar writing style to get across its reasons why some ideas stick and why others don't.  It's a good read for those who are interested in the psychology of marketing and even the concept of communication in general, but actual marketers will find it difficult to get a lot of practical methods out of the book.<br /><br />The book starts off with those ubiquitous urban legends (i.e. the man who gets his kidney stolen from a stranger and ends up in a bath tub full of ice and a tube sticking out of his back), and explains why that idea sticks and why others don't.  The Heath brothers go on to describe why numerous ideas have stuck in the collective mind: \\"It's the economy stupid,\\" \\"Where's the beef,\\" the pocket radio, and that movie popcorn has a more saturated fat than you want to know.<br /><br />The heath brothers' survey of successful ideas is wide-reaching (a great deal more than Gladwell's entertaining book), and the reader will recognize most of the case studies, which aids their main idea of stickiness.<br /><br />The authors put the stickiness factors in a nice little acronym (S.U.C.C.E.S), though the ideas those letters represent didn't stick with me (sorry) and gave a nice overview in the end with a real-life troubleshooting guide that sums up their ideas.  It's a great read for everyone, not just marketing professionals.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|Okay, techinically this is \\"second season\\", but in reality, this is the first TRUE season. First season is cute and all, but it's only prepping us for the heart, humor, and brilliance of those amazing Gilmore Girls. First season was the warm up, and here's the marathon. The incredible second season. First season got us prepared. It got us hooked on the show. Now we've got this spectacular season sitting before us. If you want to start watching, start watching here. Nothing of true meaning happens in first season. This is where all the good stuff happens.<br /><br />Second season starts with something that obviously has to end. Obviously, the main \\"single mom\\" character of a show can't get married a week into its second season! Don't fool yourselves, though. This season is big on love, crushes, and heartbreaks, if that's what you're looking for. And even if it's not, you'll still find it and plenty more.<br /><br />One of the monumental things about second season is how things start to change. The moment the concept of marriage is out, a new character enters the show. And boy, does he enter. Whether you like Jess or not, you can't deny that he is a fascinating character in that he really spices things up. Jess, Luke's nephew. It doesn't matter that a lot of people don't like him (foolishly, if you ask me, as he's my favorite boy-character throughout the entire show... none can replace him), or that nobody wanted things to change, he's here, and he's good. Jess marks the beginning of change in the show. He's the cause of pain, anger, love, and guilt. With his arrival come the problems that center around jealousy, crushes, friendships, and in general, relationships.<br /><br />So besides our new character, we've also got a whole new set of issues. Lorelai decided not to get married... so where do we go? We see her in what we have to suppose is her typical, love-less world. She's just as funny, just as witty, and just as exciting as ever. Lorelai is still our fun-loving, quick-tongued, amazing woman, and just because she doesn't have a boyfriend doesn't mean she's not interesting. We get more of her relationships with her parents in this season, too. We see Lorelai alone with her father, and alone with her mother. Lorelai deals with a lot this season, and ends it with something that seems too much like a broken heart.<br /><br />Rory, too. Our little heroine is growing up, but she's still the book-reading, obsessive studier she ever was. In this season things also change for her. The arrival of Jess causes her lots of issues with her boyfriend Dean, and these issues are not so easily resolved. More often than not, Rory and Dean are in an uncomfortable spot because of Jess. This season also shows that they rarely talk, and that their relationship is a bit strained. Besides Rory's awkward love-life, we get a sense of her other relationships too. Rory and her best friend Lane even have some issues, but those are easily resolved. Rory is even forced to try to make friends by a concerned school. Ultimately, Rory ends the year in just as much romantic turmoil as her mother, but this time she's gained a friend instead of making an enemy. Paris, with whom Rory has a \\"friends-ish\\" relationship, becomes more and more main throughout this season. Rory's suddenly got friends, boys fawning over her, and more drama than ever before.<br /><br />As was hinted last season, \\"Gilmore Girls\\" is about relationships and life. It's not just about love, and it's not just about drama. It's about the connections people make. We see the times that Lorelai and Luke are yelling at each other, both hurt more than the other can imagine. We see Rory and Lorelai fighting about the truth about the night that Rory's arm broke (watch this to find out HOW!). We watch as Lorelai fights both mother and father. We watch as Rory tries to stand up for herself, and realizes that she's doing fine. We see all of our beloved characters dealing with life in a funny and wonderful way.<br /><br />If you haven't seen first season and you want to watch the show, let me put it this way. My first episodes were from this season. It's fantastic. Even after having seen all of the show up until now, I can say that I absolutely love this season. Whether it's because of Jess, because of Rory, because of Lorelai, or because of the incredible Disc 4, I can't say. All I can say is that this is a must buy, and that anybody who can appreciate witty comments and quick humor will love this show. If you liked first season, then you'll LOVE second. If you're just starting, you can start here! It's a superb season. You can't help but fall in love with all of the characters and with everything.<br /><br />The special features are pretty cool too, and where else will you be able to watch this incredible season of this amazing show? Buy it now! You won't be disappointed in the least.and wonderful way. <br /> <br />If you haven't seen first season and you want to watch the show, let me put it this way.

B000058983|4.0|At first, i did not like the sound of the lead singers voice. Since i believed it was monotonous and did not differ from song to song. After a while though, it did grow on me. From the start though, I did love the instrumentals. I even thought the guitar pieces were phenomenal. In the end I recommend this C.D.to an experienced music lover, who dissimilar to me, will truly understand this treasure from the inception.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I love Grey's Anatomy.  Just love it, my husband love to sit around on a weekend and watch it over and over! We just can not seem to get enough of it.  Can not wait for season 3 to come out on box set, and we hope that this show NEVER ends its too go to end!!!
B00062ZE3U|5.0|This band rocks. Its to bad there not widely known.
B000ASDFJU|1.0|This dvd is what I am waiting for... But the quality of this DVD is so bad that I had to exchange it once.  The second time I received this set and found there's more problem in the DVD, I contacted Amazon, and they told me that this set has a high return rate due to it's quality.   <br /> <br />I guess what you pay is what you get.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|The quality and range of the voices in the group are impressive.  The Italian melodies are both soothing and invigorating. Great music to relax with.
B000M341QE|4.0|What can I say, Martin Scorsese did a great job with this film. Its been quite a few years since a great mob movie has come out, and this one is up their, likely to fall with the classics some day.  Although the film is 2 1/2 hours long, I found that it flowed well and the plot kept me interested.  I must say, I didn't see this ending coming, really well diguised until it happens. I'll have to watch it a couple of more times to see how the film arived at the circle ending it did, and some of the hints are subtle.  Essentially in the end, it goes to show, don't trust anybody when it comes to organized crime...they would sell their grandma's out of house and home if it would save their own hides.  A great role for Jack Nicholson, Leonardo Decaprio was actually good in this film, and I agree with the Oscar nomination for this one, although blood diamond was decent as well. Even Matt Damon fit in well.  So check this one out, I think if you like movies like Reservoir Dogs, this one will rank up their.
0618680004|5.0|It must be said that there is far too much pussy footing around religion in today's PC world. That is what is so refreshing about the approach of Mr. Richard Dawkins. Although not going out of his way to be offensive, Dawkins gives a long needed grilling to many of the beleifs and so called \\"evidence\\" within modern religion. <br /> <br />For decades if not centuries, religious people have argued that the ultimate evidence of the existence of god is the apparent 'design' of everything we see around us. They exclaim that it could not possibly be the result of some biological fluke and must be the result of intelligent design. This preposterous reasoning is comfortably put to the sword with erudition and intelligence by Dawkins. He explains that evolutionary biology does not claim for a second that chance was the creator. He informedly shows us the way in which evolution and natural selection shaped both us and what we see around us. <br /> <br />On a more sociological note, Dawkins, the founder of memesis, shows us the social roots of religion and how certain religions have survived the test of time through the posession of certain characteristics, or the fulfilling of a certain social role. He reveals that their survivial is often contingent on some of the less savoury aspects of human nature. <br /> <br />The idea of religion acting as a moral guardian that keeps society in check is exposed here as fallacious rubbish. Dawkins' enthralling arguments and evidence shows us that it is something inate in the human nature, something that predates religion that keeps us generally behaving in a moral fashion. <br /> <br />Dawkins also makes the correct (and long overdue) assertion that raising a child in a given religion before they have a chance to form their own opinions, is a form of child abuse. Religion, he says, teaches children that beleif without evidence is a good thing and that questioning things is bad. This is surely poison to a young mind and also the cause ofmuch of the world's problems. <br /> <br />Dawkins is a godsend (pun intended) to all atheists annoyed by people expounding the virtues of religion. In exposing the ridiculous nature behind religious beliefs, Dawkins has created a work of gargantuan proportions, and one that should be required reading everywhere.

0618680004|5.0|Dawkins, Richard. The God Delusion. New York,  Houghton Miflin Co., 2006.<br /><br />This writing suggests an author who is vested with a notable literary skill as well as a wide ranging knowledge of the history of science and religion. He addresses one after the other of the standard theistic contentions in turn. He effectively dismisses arguments for the presence of god and deals with such common articles of Christian faith as transubstantiation, the virgin birth, and skewers with particular ease and grace the contentious shibboleth of Intelligent Design.<br />In “The God delusion” Dawkins points out that religion has fomented a “wanton and carefully nurtured divisiveness,” wars, pogroms, the destruction of the World Trade Towers, torture, witch hunts and related misogyny as well as the torture and torment of individuals.<br />While Dawkins’ work is well received by many, he also receives vigorous protests from, one would suppose, Christians stalwartly defending god. Pages 212-213 provide profane and verbally violent examples.<br />For all his seriousness of intent, Dawkins maintains a redemptive and puckish sense of humor as is evidenced by the following quote:<br /><br />Can omniscient God, who<br />Knows the future, find<br />The omnipotence to<br />Change his future mind? (p. 78)<br /><br />An exceptional read!
B00000AOUD|5.0|This is a complete masterpiece.  This is tulls first concept album and forshadowed the progressive faze they would go into for the next couple years.  Full of great musicianship by everyone, never a dull moment.  Even if your not a huge tull fun but like prog rock this is still an essential purchase.  The track starts with Ians wonderful acoustic guitar then morphs into very technical rock.  For the next forty minutes the song moves in and out of delicate whispers to thunderous riffs then layers the original theme in and out to unify it all.  Like a great symphonic piece this track will stay with you forever.

B000056HSH|5.0|The spy adventure film \\"Three Days of the Condor\\" was released in 1975.  This was a period when the American government and the commercial sector were in a panic over our access to oil.  This was when President Gerald Ford, mindful of the power of the Oil Producing Export Countries, announced that in the future we might actually consider taking oil by force if it should be denied to America. <br /> <br />On the subject of Ford, we know that he followed Nixon, and that it was just one year before \\"Condor\\" was released that Ford's predecessor resigned in disgrace.  What did him in?  The Watergate Scandal.  What was that?  A series of clandestine activities, which once again lead back to the central point that this was a timely film. <br /> <br />Why is \\"Three Days of the Condor\\" even more timely today?  Because of all that we have been through and what we know about the CIA and its clandestine activities that we did not know then.  We have experienced 9/11 and skepticism increases over its causes and who put the plan into effect, much like those same questions being asked about the assassination of President Kennedy. <br /> <br />The reason why this film is even timelier today and can be better understood in a context better than three decades after its initial release is that we are much better informed about a major point discovered by Robert Redford, a book reader for the CIA who goes by the code name of Condor, is that there is an official CIA and another CIA.  Often the latter will superimpose itself on the former.  John Le Carre made the same point relative to MI5 in British intelligence. <br /> <br />Redford, working out of a New York office purporting to be an historical society, leaves one afternoon to order and bring back lunch for himself and the rest of the crew.  After a little chitchat at the restaurant he returns to discover that everyone in the office has been fatally shot. <br /> <br />Just where does he go from here?  Redford explains on the phone toheadquarters that he is no agent, and is just a research man who reads books and makes recommendations.  He hopes to be brought in before he meets with the same fate as his office colleagues. <br /> <br />A smooth and suave Cliff Robertson is his contact operating out of the CIA's main headquarters in Langley, Virginia.  When it is arranged for a station chief to come to New York to \\"bring him in,\\" more trouble ensues.  Redford has every reason to wonder if he has any allies left in \\"The Company\\" as he runs away from tragedy once more. <br /> <br />In an effort to secure at least temporary safety Redford kidnaps Faye Dunaway after she leaves a store where he has gone to temporarily hide from pursuers.  A professional photographer who lives in Brooklyn, Dunaway at first resists Redford, but ultimately becomes an ally when she realizes that he is telling the truth and his life is in danger.   <br /> <br />At one point Dunaway tells Redford that she is afraid to get to know him since he is not going to live very long.  He disagrees, telling her that sense of danger is a driving interest force within her toward him.  Ultimately they became romantically involved and she is willing to accompany him to Langley so he can confront Robertson.   <br /> <br />The film was released not long after Daniel Ellsberg became famous for leaking what came to be known as the Pentagon Papers.  In a fascinating twist at the end of the film, Redford uses the New York Times as a type of insurance policy. <br /> <br />Some of the film's most dramatic scenes involve Redford and Robertson, with the former speaking for the best of America as he states the case for decency and accountability in government while the latter states the proposition for secrecy and an \\"end justifies the means\\" mentality. <br /> <br />Sydney Pollack in his director's role keeps the pacing fast as befitting a spy mystery involving pursuers and pursued.  The camera work was magnificent.  Some of the long shots are particularly fascinating in displaying New York City and Washington D.C. as large cities in the midst of winter amid the ongoing tension of Redford's tense battle to survive. <br /> <br />Two prominent character actors render solid performances; John Houseman as a veteran CIA officer and colleague of Robertson's and Max Von Sydow as a contract assassin who performs his tasks with consummate professional detachment.

I made the Chocolate Vanilla Marble Cupcakes, and the Chocolate Cherry Creme Cupcakes, substituting strawberries for the cherries, because I am not a cherry fan.  It worked out wonderfully, and everyone loved them to no end!  Thanks to these lovely ladies, I was the cupcake queen of my building, and had an entire apartment of guys ready to help me out if I needed anything...

B000M5AJQS|5.0|Very rarely has Martin Scorsese let me down.  Any fears I had going into The Departed were quickly put to rest within the opening minutes of the film, beginning with a voiceover from criminal mastermind Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson, perfectly cast), and his recruitment of Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), who quickly rises in the ranks of the Boston police department while providing Costello with the info he needs to avoid detection and capture.  A snag gets put in the plans however when crook turned cop Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is chosen to infiltrate Costello's world, as both he and Sullivan end up playing a cat and mouse game of lies and deception in an attempt to catch and kill one another.  With great performances from DiCaprio, Damon, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and Mark Wahlberg in what ended up being an Oscar nominated performance; The Departed is pure Scorsese all the way, including some of the most inventive use of cell phones you'll ever find in a big time film.  Any reports of \\"sloppy craftsmanship\\" should be disregarded, as this is one of Scorsese's best films in his long established and Oscar ignored career.  Absolutely spectacular from beginning to end, The Departed is a modern day masterpiece.
0770430074|2.0|I don't get why everyone loved this book. Besides the fact that my suspension of disbelief never kicked in, I didn't understand what point the author was trying to make: that any religion is acceptable even if you have to make it up yourself? I don't know. But the fact that I was even asking this question proves that the book wasn't working for me the way it should. With my favorite fiction I never ask what the point is--I just enjoy it.
B0009A40ES|4.0|Before he was Batman, Christian Bale turned the film world on it's ear with his incredible performance in this adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' controversial novel.  Bale stars as Wall Street yuppie Patrick Bateman, who is living the good life in the indulgent 80's.  By night, Bateman is a psychotic serial killer whose masterful routine is coming apart at the seams.  While it has uneven moments, Bale's star making performance is worth seeing American Psycho for alone.  No one else could have brought the character of Patrick Bateman to life better than Bale, and the rest of the cast, including Reese Witherspoon, Justin Theroux, Josh Lucas, Jared Leto, Willem Dafoe, Chloe Sevigny, and Samantha Mathis; are great as well as supporting characters too obsessed with themselves to realize or care as to what Patrick is doing.  A spectacular satire and a showcase for Bale's talents; American Psycho isn't quite a classic, but it's pretty close regardless.
B000KX0IOK|5.0|\\"Half Nelson\\" is one of those small films that tackles gritty subject matter without concern to being \\"politically correct\\" or - worse -\\"marketable\\" to a mass audience. This allows the Actors and Writers more artistic freedom. Reminiscent of 2000's excellent \\"Requiem for a Dream,\\" \\"Half Nelson\\" shows the ravages of drug addiction on a seemingly normal person. At the beginning of the film, Ryan Gosling's Dan Dunne seems merely an offbeat, creative inner-city Teacher, but the depth of his crack addition soon begins to show. Mr. Gosling bravely tackles this role with grace and a strange dignity - halfway into the film he wears a goofy bandage on his lip after a girlfriend pops him during a crack-fueled seduction. His Oscar nomination is well-deserved: he never takes this role \\"over the top\\" and manages to be sympathetic and tragic all at once. Ms. Epps is excellent as well, displaying a maturity and finesse as Mr. Gosling's ally.
B000000W6F|4.0|I really enjoyed this album.  I have a lot of other SP albums and it was great listening to this one after hearing all the other ones. This album definitely has their early on signature licks.  \\"rhinoceros\\" really stands out as one of the best songs of this album.
0894803123|2.0|Bought this book with my new Cuisinart ice cream maker (see review).  Thought the ice cream maker was mediocre after using ice cream recipes from this book (haven't tried the sherbert or sorbet recipes yet).  While the book had good ideas, the ice cream tasted just OK.  Tried a few other recipes with similar results.  Again, blamed the machine.  Then we hit on Christopher Kimball's recipe in the Desert Bible.  At last, great ice cream.  Not icy, but creamy.  Full of flavor.  Takes a bit more work than the recipes in this book, but worth it. <br /> <br />Buy it for ideas to use with other recipes.

B000M5AJQI|5.0|Ok, I saw this in the theatres and have to say this is some of his finest work. So far he's been snubbed the past five years when it came to Best Director. I thought \\"The Aviator\\" was more of an epic-biopic, and beautiful and engaging to watch. Now Million Dollar Baby was good, bur not Best Director worthy. So anyway, \\"The Departed\\", an excellent film, and really breaks away from Scorses's typical mob film. It's a REAL departure, no pun intended. I want it on Blu-Ray because, well I can do Blu-Ray. But I noticed that the TCM bio of Martin Scorses is missing from the Blu-Ray disk, yet it's on the regular DVD version. For the size capabilities of Blu-Ray and HD-DVD, they did'nt include that feature, and it makes me scheptical about spending 15 dollars more for HD.
B000AOENJA|5.0|Even White Ladder's the best work yet from David Gray, this CD gives something else: planning. What? Plannig? Yes... White Ladder was the last chance for Mr Gray to continue in the music bussiness and eventually it would be his best selling album. But here, you don't feel presion, hurry or even a simple mod. Everything here is where it has to be. Mr. Gray is a talented man and you can notice he planned everything in detail. He was so precise that you have to use hearphones to notice some details on his music and vocals (that's not a problem for me but maybe some people could think it is... besides if you use a Home Theather you'll notice everything). You have to listen this work several times to get it but when you do, you get an incredible experience. Don't waste your time thinking that Gray has left his talent behind... here is the proof you need to know that the better is yet to come. BTW... this edition DOES NOT offers 5.1 sound. Only PCM so you might want to consider your buying for the regular edition. If you are not an English speaker, you'll find this edition useful since the lyrics appears on screen while you listen to the music. I love that!

B00003CX9S|5.0|The elephant man is a fictionalized movie about the life of a man named John Merrick (Joseph Carey Merrick was actually his real name) who lived in the 19th century and suffered from a disfiguring disease which limited him to career working as a circus side show entertainer.<br /><br />It was originally thought Merrick's disease was either neurofibromatosis or elephantiasis.  Generally speaking, Neurofibromatosis is a genetic condition that affects the skin, bones, muscles, and the central nervous system.  Elephantiasis which is also known as Lymphatic Filariasis, is a disease, often found in tropical countries, in which parts of the human body become enlarged. It is caused by small roundworms that are injected into the body by mosquitoes.<br /><br />However, around the time the film came out, it was suggested that Merrick had Proteus syndrome or \\"Elephant Man's Disease\\", which causes abnormal, unchecked growth of skeletal, dermatological, and other bodily systems.  Clinical experts seem now to aggree that Merrick suffered from Proteus syndrome.  Proteus syndrome also demonstrates great clinical variability meaning it is not constant in its expression and fewer than 100 cases of Proteus have ever been recorded.<br /><br />The story is moving and the performances delivered by John Hurt in the role of the Elephant Man and Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Frederick Treves, are spectacular.  I was touched by the manner in which director David Lynch conveys the message that \\"all humans matter.\\"  This film also features<br />fine and dignified performances by Anne Bancroft and John Gielgud. Freddie Jones is brilliant in the part of Bytes and in one line immortalizes the movie when he refers to Merrick in the possessive as \\"my treasure.\\"  The words uttered by Bytes are reminscent of Tolkiens Golem who when refering to the ring of power used \\"my precious\\" to signify his unhealthy attachment.<br /><br />For those of you that have read about the real life of Joseph Merrick, you will notice that Hollywood used their creative liberties in creating an interesting, though fictionalized black and white version of the real story.<br /><br />So when your girlfriend becomes upset and starts to cry at the end of the film, you can comfort her and let her know that in reality it was not that way.  You can explain that no one enslaved Merrick and that it was in fact Merrick who actively sought out a career in the circus pitching himself to Sam Torr, a compassionate man and small time showman portrayed in the movie as Merrick's unscrupulous exploiter Bytes.  Instead of possessing Merrick for personal gain, Torr facilitated a meeting for Merrick to meet Tom Norman the P.T. Barnum of Victorian England.  Ultimately, it was Tom Norman who generously paid for the many surgeries Merrick would require and helped Merrick become successful in the circus business.<br /><br />The portrayal of Joseph Carey Merrick's death however was accurate.  Joseph Carey Merrick died of asphyxiation when attempting lie down like a normal person might.  When he did, the weight of the tumors on his head and neck had crushed his trachea.  It is not clear if he committed suicide, but you can judge for yourself.  This movie is a must for all collectors of fine films.creative liberties in creating an interesting, though fictionalized black and white version of the real story.

This was obviously done both with intimate knowledge of the recordings and love for the music itself. Many of the mixes are fanciful and ear-poppingly creative, like you're hearing the songs for the first time, or seeing an old friend after many years. Drive My Car/The Word/What You're Doing is a great example of the genius of the arrangers. Put this CD on, set the speakers to \\"earbleed\\" and go wash your VW van. Sheer joy. :)
0634060384|4.0|No matter what any one says about this book, it is still without doubt an essential purchase for anyone interested in pursuing Jazz music seriously. I've read reviews complaining about the Keys of certain songs being different to previous editions, which for me isn't really much of an issue. The ability to transpose a song from one key to another should be part of any Jazz musician's repetoire. That said, I've not come across any songs in the book yet which are in \\"unusual\\" keys. In short, buy this book if you want to pursue Jazz music; its realitvely cheap and its to the point; It doesn't have any frills but that is why I like it.
B000GFLE86|4.0|Raspy, breezy, and relaxed are good adjectives to describe the music and Madeleine Peyroux's approach to these songs.  Yet each time I hear it there's a new depth and nuance to the CD I hadn't appreciated before.  With a nice balance of standards and new songs, everything's rendered just a little off-beat.  This is good stuff.  It won't be gathering much dust on the shelf at my house in years to come.

B00003CWL6|5.0|When I first saw this film years ago in the theater, I left thinking that it was just okay.  I certainly didn't see why it garnered so much critical acclaim.  Then a funny thing happened...time.  Now in my mid thirties and being a homeowner, I realize I know and recognize many of the characters and dysfunctional behaviors in this film.  I'm familiar with the longing to go back when you felt like your whole life was ahead of you.  My first job was also in the fast food industry for very little money--and you know what?  It was one of the happier times in my life.  Responsibilities weren't so heavy and no matter what my parents just didn't get me.  Annette Bennings's character suddenly have so much depth to me.  The extremes to which people go to hide their personal darkness-isn't satire but reality.  Sure this is a film where you can pick apart everyone's flaws-and there are plenty to go around-but I think one point of the movie is: that we all have them.  We are never what we seem.  Overall: highly recommended.
B0000YB7Z8|4.0|Once again, Ian Anderson is quite entertaining as a front-man. However, rock-music historians may write that Anderson's greatest strength lies with the musical ensembles he creates. Specifically, \\"Bursting Out: Jethro Tull Live\\", allows the listener to enjoy the collective genius of Martin Barre, Barrymore Barlow, and John Glascock. Any self-respecting Tull fan already has this CD in their collection.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|I have to admit that when I heard Daniel Craig was going to replace Pierce Brosnan, an actor who has done a fine job, one almost as good as Sean Connery, I was incredibly apprehensive and even thought of boycotting the film. I must say that I'm glad I didn't. As other reviewers have written, this movie is Bond the way he was meant to be seen (it's too bad that Brosnan was not the beneficiary of such a solid script because almost all of his movies were overly far-fetched and to a certain extent, campy). The story, based on the first Bond novel is perfect for Craig because he provides the physical force necessary to play the role. <br /> <br />And what kind of Bond do we have? He doesn't have the suave and sophisticated carriage of the previous actors, but Craig does not need it since this is Bond when he just gains double O status. What this movie does is bring us back to the basics, especially in terms of the action sequences. Even if the movie were not a Bond film, it would be highly entertaining, the fact that it fits into this franchise makes it all the more rewarding.  <br /> <br />Without going into the actual plot, I would like to say that this movie is a success, one not to be missed.

The minimal dialouge sprinkled throughout is rarely as important as the images unfolding on the screen. The pace moves at a gloomy crawl, a few instances of tasteful comedy keeping the mood from becoming too heavy(it should be noted that Billy is mostly poking fun at himself, not the Japanese people.)  The two main characters are kept apart for most of film, with Sophia wisely choosing to dwell on them when their alone both literally and metaphorically; this intrusion of their privacy allowing the viewer to really submerge themselves in the characters'lives for better or for worst. As Bob and Charlotte cross paths more and more fequently the movie builds with understated urgency, until the film springs to life midway through when they finally come together for a night on the town in a fast paced sequence of fun colorful adventures.     The film is never this lively or hopeful again, as the final moments gradually develop a painful almost dread quality to them as Bob and Charlotte are faced with the realization that this retreat from their misery can't last forever.  Oddly enough, the moving conclusion ends up being a bittersweet triumph, hinting at a new found strength in the characters.  Sophia  makes good use of both the actors and the beautiful urban setting while showing an excellent understanding for almost pure visual storytelling.  Tokyo simply looks beautiful as she allows the camera to drone on the lovely details of the city and it's citizens; mostly through the eyes of an aimlessly wandering Charlotte. After watching the film, one feels as if they know the city and the hotel as well as the characters.  However, it's really the performances that carry the film.      Bill and Scarlett prove to be more than up to the task of almost wordless acting.  Though his weathered face is mostly somber and blank, Bill's soulful eyes stare with aprofound unrest and longing, the slightest gesture conveying pages of depth and emotion that probably wasn't in the script. A very mature Scarlett does much of her acting with subtle looks of vaguely masked dis-satisfaction and desperate unrest; often appearing to be completely helpless and vunerable to the depression she's sunk into.  Her and Bill's characters might as well be the same age as both seem to be feeling the same thing.  When they do interact, the scenes are filled with incredibly sincere subtle gestures that reflect warm fondness and understanding if not an all out unspoken attraction. It's this geniune warmth that makes the film so romantic and the earlier melancholy all the more worthwhile.  In his small role, Ribisi is also enjoyable as Scarlett's well meaning but clueless husband. Some find it difficult to empathize with the characters and the irony of their situation(apparently rich and depressed), yet anyone who's ever felt alone(see: everybody) should not have trouble relating.     DVD Notes-A short featurette with Sophia and Bill is the most useful and watchable. There is sadly no commentary, and the deleted scenes add nothing, while the Music Video is kind of meh. The menu screen is beautiful however.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|In my opinion one of Gary Coopers greatest roles. The background story is excellent making this movie one you can watch over and over.
B000AMJG4Y|1.0|I guess I'm biased 'cause I thought the game sucked. But from the people saying that they liked the game but hated the movie, well... Maybe there's something to that. <br /> <br />Anyway, how am I supposed to like this movie if not by the special effects? I mean, woo, you can make things on the screen look real pretty. Way to go. That's not why I watch movies. <br /> <br />Like I said before, I hated the game, but I watched it with people who didn't hate the game. One fanboy thought it was really good! The rest thought it was 'okay.' I thought it was just bad. <br /> <br />Let's review here, for the people who played it. <br /> <br />Characters: Forget the fun ones. Barrett went anorexic, Red XIII was underused, Cid had a one-liner comic relief entrance, AERIS IS NOT AN INTERESTING NOR AN IMPORTANT CHARACTER, Sephiroth's too broody, Cloud's too whiny, AERIS IS NOT AN INTERESTING NOR AN IMPORTANT CHARACTER, Vincent seemed to just be trying to be more angsty than Cloud (okay, note here. Anyone catch the angst-off Cloud and Vincent have for a second there? \\"My life sucks...\\" \\"My life sucks /more./\\" \\"No, MINE.\\" \\"Nuh-uh!\\" I thought that was amusing, almost as amusing as the incredibly dumb Cloud-tossing sequence). By the way, AERIS WAS NOT AN INTERESTING NOR AN IMPORTANT CHARACTER IN THE GAME. A bunch of hormone driven fanboys freaked out over her in the game (Fenix downs suddenly don't work, I guess) even though she had no development, was worthless as a character, and generally could have been taken out of the game completely with no effect. Cloud was a whiny loser before he met her, and was only marginally more of a whiny loser after she dies. <br /> <br />Why all this ado about Aeris? Because apparently, she's freakin' GOD in this movie. <br /> <br />F Minus Minus, Square. F. Minus. Minus. <br /> <br />[What] Plot[?]:  <br /> <br />Animation: It was good. I'da been more impressed if they could've synched the special effects into a live action movie, but the animationwas really good. <br /> <br />Voice acting: I watched it with subtitles, and the Japanese voice acting was pretty decent, nailing the personalities of the characters right on the head. The voice fit the new Barrett, but Barrett is, in my mind, the guy that's twice the size of Cloud, not some Hot Topic pseudo-goth clothing model. <br /> <br />Ending: The biggest tease in the world. I hate Cloud, so the folk who've seen this movie know. <br /> <br />It's got all the flaws of the game; predictability and flat characters at the front of the pack, and it has an underuse of the good parts of the game, which were the quality side characters (Cid, Barrett, Red, Reno, etc.). I just couldn't bring myself to care about anything going on on screen. Whatever. <br /> <br />Blah.
B00004WCLC|1.0|I watched this movie recently, and was quite disappointed.  There was a great story, incredible actors and performances, wonderful photography and production values, but a butchered screenplay and editing job.  The movie couldn't decide whether to be a thriller or a farce, and lost on both accounts.  Crash got 4 1/2 stars from me, this gets 1 1/2 stars, strictly for the technical work and acting.  There is a good reason it was a dud at the box office with the incredible cast it had, folks didn't like it.  I wouldn't say don't see it, but expect a disjointed, confused viewing.
B000301YY8|4.0|I bought the CD for James' hit single Beautiful.  I was also curious as to what his other music sounded like.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that I enjoy most of the songs on the CD.  I would buy another Cd of his in the future.
B000FIMG68|5.0|I have been been a fan of Lost but when I bought the season I became obsessed.  Sometimes watching 4-5 episodes in a row.  If you have a lot of free time, or if you are a rebel and would rather watch Lost than go to class or work, buy Lost!
0307346609|4.0|It's pretty much a done deal that I would really enjoy \\"World War Z\\", because it combines two themes I love in fiction: Zombies and Post-apocalyptic survival. Even so, it's possible to screw it up (see Stephen King's \\"Cell\\", for example.) Fortunately, Mr. Brooks knows his way around Zombies. <br /> <br />The book consists of a series of first-hand accounts which detail, chronologically, the unfolding of the Zombie crisis that nearly destroys civilization. There were a few stories that I especially enjoyed. There was one about this Japanese internet kid who only realizes he is deep into it when his internet connection goes down. (His parents and neighbors are already gone.) That particular tale had a \\"Day of the Triffids\\" quality. Another great story is told from the perspective of a pilot who crashes behind enemy lines in Louisiana swamp territory. Very cool. The story of the Battle of Hope was perhaps my favorite--the humans have finally gotten their act together and start turning the tide against the Gs! <br /> <br />A very entertaining read, and a sure bet if you like millions and millions of Zombies!
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I happened upon this CD by accident, and it quickly became the favorite CD I've purchased in years. The lush harmonies and orchestral arrangements are reminiscent of the music of \\"Riverdance,\\" which comes as no surprise since David Downes--the arranger/music director behind \\"Celtic Woman\\"--spent several years with \\"Riverdance.\\" <br /> <br />The obvious stars of the show are the lady vocalists (and one violin) which are the focal point of these songs. These ladies are all marvelous. However, I think David Downes is equally as much of a star of this production since his brilliant arrangements of both standard and contemporary Irish music are the foundation on which this entire CD stands. <br /> <br />There are about 6-8 cuts on the CD that will be on my \\"all-time favorite\\" list of songs for many years to come, but I think my favorite will always be \\"Nella Fantasia.\\" This timeless piece was first written by Ennio Morricone for the movie \\"The Mission\\" as in instrumental piece. Several years later, Sarah Brightman convinced him to add lyrics which were penned in Italian by Ferraú. To my ears, music simply doesn't get any better than this.
B000F5GNX8|5.0|What witty action!  I really enjoyed the humor of this film. Robert Downey Jr. was excellent in his role, as were Val Kilmer and Michelle Monaghan.  The three had fantastic chemistry and every scene showed that synergy.  I loved the layers of the murder mystery allying goofball antics and smart twists.  Color also played an important role in the film--vivid comic book-esque scenes enhanced the edginess of the dark comedy.  Downey's narration was consistently amusing.  This film's ability to mock itself made every scene move the plot at a pretty intense pace.  As I am wont to love, really smart lines abound.
B00000AFFI|5.0|It is hard to claim for a PJ Harvey album as her best, because every album of hers is such a classic! Is This Desire includes some of her most melancholic and darkest songs yet such as the classics \\"The River\\", \\"Angelene\\" and \\"Catherine\\". I  believe this album carries her \\"To Bring You My Love\\" album one step forward.Because her vocals are much more clear and comfortable. Melodies of songs are more experimental. However, they really catch the listener easily. Even the darkest \\"Electric Light\\", \\"Catherine\\" and \\"My Beatuiful Leah\\" can be your personal favorite from the very first listening. Try this album if you want to hear from one of the most talented female musicians of the last two decades.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|It's genuine, it's heartfelt and it's music that resonates long after you've finished hearing it.  <br /> <br />Norah Jones is an American artistic treasure. And quite simply, \\"Not Too Late\\" is one of the top recordings of the year.
B00008J4P5|4.0|As a duo who has been on stage since 1997, The White Stripes did incredible job with releasing Elephant. I cannot say that i was a big fan of The White Stripes until they released the Elephant album. The first single \\"Seven Nation Army\\" gave me the feeling that it may be the only song that would attrack me on the album. But when i buy the cd, i understood that there has been much more to the White Stripes.  <br />I can say that all songs on the album are very close to perfection. \\"In The Cold, Cold Night\\", \\"I Want to Be The Boy to Warm Your Mother's Heart\\" ,\\"It's True that We Love One Another\\" are the sweetest and warmest songs that you can hear from an American rock band. Dusty Springfield cover \\" I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself\\" is one of the peaking points in the album which makes you wanna bang your head to walls! Moreover, the songs \\"Ball and Biscuit\\" and the third single from the album \\"The Hardest Button to Button\\" are like the answers to the question that how rock'n roll can be such chilly. To keep it short, this albums rocks from numerous ways. It's easy to listen to this album.It feels like The White Stripes have found the simplist formula of writing perfect songs.Really cool.
0974869449|5.0|I won't go into much detail, I'll just say that these cards give me everything I need for my kanji studies! They look great, have a clever information layout (no romaji readings, which is a PLUS!) and even look-alike kanji characters! Of all the kanji flashcard sets available to people studying Japanese, these are the best! You get color-coded flashcards with round edges, full stroke order diagrams, meanings, readings (onyomi and kunyomi), schematics of kanji elements and SIX compounds for each kanji! Is there anything else one might want from this kind of product? Simply wonderful! If there's anything that can help me pass JLPT exams, this is it! Kudos to authors! Keep up the great work!
0783117523|3.0|The movie is OK, not the greatest.  But you do get to see Angelina without a shirt, running and jumping into a chainlink fence.  A little bit odd scene, could have done without the fence part.  I liked Hackers a little bit better than this one.

0743464117|5.0|I have read alot of WWII history books, so therefore I am very familiar with Ambrose's work.  While it may be hard to say which one is his best because he always did a fantastic job of telling \\"the story\\", maybe this is just one of the best stories he had the chance to tell.  This book is a personal inspiration; I have given it to many friends to read and they are always in awe when they return it.  While this book has obvious appeal to any WWII buff, it is such an amazing story that anyone can enjoy it.  Then I saw the HBO series, and oh boy did the story ever \\"come to life\\".  Read the book, watch the series, and just be prepared to deal with the overcoming urge to drive to the recruiting center!
B000KX0IOK|4.0|Dan Dunne (Ryan Gosling) doesn't have his act together.  He takes his junior high history class through an impromptu exercise in history.  There are some methods to his madness, but not all the synapses are firing.  Mainly his.  He's also the girls' basketball coach.  And it is after one of their many losses that he enters the abandoned girls' locker room and lights up crack cocaine in the bathroom stall.  One of the friendlier students, Drey (Shareeka Epps) catches him strung out on the floor.  To save face, he takes her home, for her honest earning mom can't shuttle her daughter around.  She's not a soccer mom like in the suburbs.  On the sidelines, Dan parties with acquainances, including Drey's brother (Anthony Mackie) who is a drug dealer.  Drey keeps all things under her hat, and both coach and pupil develop a chummy relationship while Dan tries futilely to keep it professional.  At school, Dan makes connections in history about opposites conflicting with one another as a key component of history.  In the movie we make connections with the full cycle of the drug market from dealer to consumer.  (Even though the focus is more of a tight-knit drama and an examination of the characters than the subject matter, unlike an expose' like 'Traffic'.)    Gosling gives a worthy Oscar nominee performance showing the subtlety of drug addiction like few others.  Mostly, other movies present it as more dramatic and less pedestrian.  We see his life slowly unravel as he becomes irritible about every interruption in the everyday chain.  At one point he throws a ball at the referee who seemed to be asleep at the wheel.  It is to their credit that filmmakers Ryan Fleck and Anna Borden, et al, provide a movie where he slowly loses footing in most major foundations of his life.  Once he spirals, colleagues begin to see that his life is amiss, but faithful Drey keeps her concern to the end.  Shattering but subtle, 'Half Nelson' creeps up on the viewer as well as the protagonist with a sincere presentation.
0307237699|5.0|I have never been so moved by reading a book. Barack Obama writes with such passion and conviction, you can't help but appreciate that, even if you don't agree with him politically. I appreciated the fact that he did outline a few ideas he had  regarding fiscal spending and helping to reduce our debt, that would be possible with simply rolling back tax cuts for the extremly wealthy. I also loved the conversation between him and Warren Buffet which was a very nice conversation, and one that certainly resonated with me. <br />  Never in my life have I felt so strongly for a candidate. When Barack speaks, he speaks from the heart. I hope and pray others out there who may differ politically, can see thatits not about you, but whats best for this country. At this time in our nations history, please show you we can restore the respect of our nation across the world. Electing Barack Obama to the highest level in the land would be  wonderful not only for this nations but other nations as well. <br />I never ask for anything in my life....but I am asking that all people regardless of party affiliation come together to support this man.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Well done!  The film on Masterpiece Theatre left me wanting to watch it over and over!  Thus, I am eagerly awaiting the arrival of my copy so I might do just that.

B000M341QE|5.0|Proving that he is not dimming with age, Martin Scorsese directs perhaps his best crime drama in \\"The Departed\\", written by William Monahan and inspired by the 2002 Hong Kong thriller \\"Infernal Affairs\\". Corruption and duplicity are the rule in the longstanding feud between the Irish crime syndicate of South Boston and the Massachusetts State Police. Crime boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) took Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) under his wing as a youngster and groomed him to serve the syndicate. Sullivan grew up to be a cop and rose through the ranks in the State Police's Special Investigations Unit (SIU), where he fights organized crime while keeping Costello well-informed. Billy Costigan (Leoardo DiCaprio) was recruited out of the police academy to a deep undercover operation within Costello's inner circle, known only to Capt. Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Sgt. Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) of the SIU. When the criminals and police both realize that they have a mole in their organizations, a complicated game of cat and mouse ensues.<br /><br />There have been other movies about double crosses and double agents, but none so gut-wrenching as \\"The Departed\\". Great dialogue and characters who sit constantly on the emotional edge set this film apart. Billy is a bright guy trying to hold onto his identity. Colin is a yuppie trying to focus on his ambitions. They are both about to crack. But there is no melodrama, just a suspenseful, violent ride that looks like it can't possibly turn out well. The cynicism escalates in tandem with the characters' anxieties. Nicholson abandons his shtick and does some real acting here as an admittedly entertaining sociopathic sleazebucket. If \\"The Departed\\" has a flaw, it is excessive length. An hour into the film I was wondering how it could run another hour and a half. Some of the early exposition could have been cut. But most of the time is spent on unexpected twists and turns -that really are unexpected. \\"The Departed\\" commendably avoids doing the obvious at most points along the way. It keeps the audience guessing, while powerful performances keep us involved.g the obvious at most points along the way. It keeps the audience guessing, while powerful performances keep us involved.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|My favorite period English romance is Pride and Prejudice, but this version of Jane Eyre ranks right up there with it.  I loved it!  I have never actually read the book but have seen other film versions of this story.  This is certainly my favorite.  A marvellous story with the happiest of endings!  Five stars plus!
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Big Fish is a movie about a familiar character type:  the ex-jock who becomes a highly successful traveling Southern salesman.  Edward Bloom is a \\"well-liked\\" salesman who spins comic fish stories and Davy Crockett style tall tales about his days of athletic glory.

Big Fish is a comedy masterpiece that you cannot afford to miss.
1582701709|2.0|Like all pseudo-spiritual garbage, \\"The Secret\\" is a mixture of a little good and a ton of bad.  It contributes to the ongoing legacy of opportunistic \\"new-agers\\" who steal the mystical teachings of various religions and appropriate them to suit the materialistic mentality of the 21st century Westerner.  As always, instead of teaching humanity how to *comprehend* the sources of their desires and suffering - through meditation, reflection, or honest introspection - the makers of this video simply teach us a trick by which we can further enslave ourselves to these sources (of desire and suffering).    Meanwhile, they are making quite a pretty penny for sharing such \\"truths\\"...    I agree that gratitude, thankfulness and compassion are humane and beautiful things.  It is clear that thoughts are powerful generators of circumstances and events.  But that to be happy we must fulfill our every desire?  Damnation!  This contradicts the living teachings of every great Master humanity has ever known!      Buddha Shakyamuni: \\"Desire is the root of all suffering.\\"    Krishnamurti: \\"You will find this undying, unalterable happiness when you are liberated from the tyrannies of the self, its desires and longings.\\"     The Lord Krishna: \\"When a man dwells in his mind on the object of sense, attachment to them is produced. From attachment springs desire and from desire comes anger.\\"    Paramahansa Yogananda: \\"When external objects of sense pleasure are destroyed, the happiness they give is destroyed with them.  But the ever new joy of God inherent in the soul is indestructible.\\"    Thomas a Kempis: \\"Learn to despise outward things and to give thyself to things inward, and thou shalt see the kingdom of God come within thee.\\"    Samael Aun Weor: \\"Analyze all human defects and you will see that they all have their foundation in desire.\\"     Jesus the Christ: \\"Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.\\"    The \\"Secret\\" that God *wants* us to fulfill our every materialistic desire clearly contradicts the authentic religious teachings from every continent and every age.  It also flies in the face of a million real-life stories about the miserable rich, the drug-addicted celebrity, the unhappy millionaire, etc. etc. etc.     Thus, we can either continue to chase our own tails seeking happiness in the same old way, or we can start to look at this question in a totally new, intimate, and profoundly personal light.    The prophets have spoken and so have the vipers of materialism.  Who will you put your trust in?

B00004NJJQ|5.0|Unless you are a collector and must have all UFO's albums like me forget about anything prior to this album. This is when things really kicked off musically with the addition of Michael Schenker on guitars. This and the five albums that followed were the golden era and the best stuff they produced period. I remember playing my vinyl copy of this to destruction at sixth form college and converting a few students on the way. \\"Doctor Doctor\\" and \\"Rockbottom\\" are legendary rockers along with quite an assortment of tunes with a more acoustic feel on this one. \\"Queen of the Deep\\" pounds along with a Sabbath-like hook line then the Schenker solo rips in and melts the speakers. Blues cover \\"Built for Comfort\\" is superb and after hearing countless other versions nothing can compare to Phil Mogg's vocal and the teenage Schenker's lead guitar. If you're new to UFO I would get the live album \\"Strangers in the Night\\" first as a taster. After that any of \\"Obsession\\", \\"Lights Out\\", \\"No Heavy Pettin\\", \\"Force It\\" or this one which are all quality and still provide most of their current live set.  <br />

0143039601|5.0|Jack Kerouac is one of those artists, musicians, or writers who I get really into for a while, then don't occupy my time with their works, but always come back to them at some point.  I read On the Road around 6-7 years ago and afterward quickly read Big Sur and Visions of Girard.  Over the past few years though, I thought maybe I had grown out of him.  So when my Dad recently gave me a City Lights gift certificate for Christmas, I made a mental note that I'd like to see if I still liked Jack Kerouac or not. I found a neat copy of The Dharma Bums that I had never seen before, so I grabbed it.   <br /> <br />Dharma Bums is my favorite Kerouac book so far.  As with On the Road, I found his writing to be very evocative; scenery, places, but especially the people Jack comes across in his adventures really come to life.  As with his other works, Kerouac calls refers to himself by another name, and in The Dharma Bums he is known as Ray Snyder.  The other protagonist is Zen poet Gary Snyder, or Japhy Ryder as he is known here.  Dharma Bums starts off \\"Ray\\" and \\"Japhy\\" and friends hanging out in the Bay Area, and recounts the now-legendary night Allen Ginsburg first recited \\"Howl\\" during the heyday of the \\"San Francisco Renaissance.\\" He also briefly goes over an odd sort of orgy at Japhy's Berkeley house, where all Ray felt comfortable doing was licking some girl's elbows and arms.  I have to admit I had just come home from a happy hour when I read the first 30 pages, so that part is kind of fuzzy in my memory.   <br /> <br />Following this, the book recalls their trip up the Matterhorn, a large mountain in California's Sierra Nevada mountain range.  This was the highlight of the book for me.  I felt like I was right there with Ray, Japhy, and their friend Morley who forgot to bring a sleeping bag for the freezing trek, but insisted on bringing an air mattress for him to sleep on.  One thing about Kerouac's book is that you can really tell he loves the company of his friends and people he meets on the road.  I can't ever recall reading a bad thing about anyone in any of his books.  I think a large part of the reason I like reading his books so much is that I appreciate his sincere joy he finds from people and nature.  Others might call it naïveté, but bullocks to them.  <br /> <br />Following the Matterhorn expedition, Ray leaves to visit his Mom in North Carolina.  He hops trains, takes the bus, and hitchhikes across the country.  There's the guy from Ohio he meets near the Mexican border, and the fun they have when they make an excursion across the border.  In North Carolina one gets the sense that Ray isn't appreciated by his family that much.  He tries to explain Buddhism and they laugh him off.  I couldn't help but feel bad for him.  His mom seems nice, but she is never really developed that well.   <br />Every day he went into the woods to meditate and cavort with the animals.  I think that's probably what I would be doing too.   <br /> <br />After his return to CA, he is about to take a summer job as a fire lookout in Washington State's Desolation Peak, on Japhy's recommendation.  Likewise, Japhy is about to head to Japan to live at a Buddhist monastery.  Being Ray and Japhy however, you know there has to be some serious partying before they leave.  They are staying in Corte Madera, and there are wild parties every night, usually involving copious amounts of alcohol and people dancing naked.  Japhy and Ray sneak out a few days before Japhy is scheduled to leave, and go on a final trek through Marin County wilderness. Japhy leaves and everyone is sad.   <br /> <br />The final part of TDB is Ray making his way up to Washington.  The strangers he meets are usually nice, with the exception of the Oregon cowboy who purposely runs over Ray's hat on the road.  He briefly covers his time as a fire lookout, but I'm sure Desolation Angels goes into much more detail.  That will be the next Kerouac book I read.  There are a lot of Buddhist themes, prayers, and sayings throughout the book (hence the title.) While that might turn some readers off, I enjoyed it.  Buddhism is something that has interested me for quite some time.  It's sad that Jack didn't find what he was looking for.  The bottle turned out to be his salvation - and demise.  <br />
0307237699|4.0|In the prologue to THE AUDACITY OF HOPE, Barack Obama sets out his primary goal for this book: \\"how we might being the process of changing our politics and our civil life.\\" What he means is that political discourse has become like a game, more interested in scoring points off the other side than in working together to sincerely tackle pressing problems. He means that we need \\"a new kind of politics\\" that tries to bring the country together, to recreate the shared assumptions that bind us all together as one people. <br /> <br />This is an important idea, and one that Obama makes the case for eloquently. Indeed it is one that has rocketed Barack Obama from an obscure seat in the Illinois state senate into a legitimate candidate for President of the United States. But it is an idea, in the end, for a speech or for an essay--not a book. <br /> <br />THE AUDACITY OF HOPE is very well written, and its readers cannot help but get the sense that Obama is an honest, thoughtful, and highly impressive person. He lays out his thoughts on politics, family, race, faith, opportunity, and \\"the world beyond our borders.\\" As campaign literature, it is entirely successful. Yet also a word of caution for fans of his previous book: be wary of setting your expectations too high. DREAMS FROM MY FATHER is a genuine achievement, a lasting contribution to American letters. Don't expect that here. There are a fair amount of revealing anecdotes and brilliant turns of phrase in AUDACITY. But for the most part, the book is too unfocused to have the expressive power of DREAMS. Simultaneously, it ranges too broadly to really include a deep or complete treatment of specific issues (Obama leaves no political stone unturned).     <br /> <br />What AUDACITY fundamentally lacks is a sense of overarching narrative, something that connects all the different things Obama talks about into one idea, one movement. He attempts to find this idea in his call for common ground, for a new kind of politics. But this vision is too vague to sustain the entire book. Consequently, each of the ten chapters more or less stands alone, some being stronger than others. The third chapter on \\"Our Constitution\\" is uniformly excellent; Obama's thoughts on \\"Opportunity\\" and \\"Race\\" are weaker. As a general matter the analysis is always sharp. But it must be said that he is more adept at diagnosing problems than at offering solutions. Obama is at his best when he is telling stories and exhorting readers to chase their dreams and to imagine what is possible, playing to his formidable skills as a literary writer. The book stutters, though, when it comes to concrete policy proposals. For example, his answer to the black ghetto is a federal job program. The gulf between the vastness of our national problems and the smallness of AUDACITY's proffered solutions is large. <br /> <br />To bridge this gulf Obama instead offers us inspiration and dreams: that is, \\"the audacity of hope.\\" But whose inspiration, and inspiration in what? Inevitably, this \\"sense of possibility\\" is drawn to a single source: the author himself, Barack Obama as the receptacle for our collective hopes and collective dreams. Yet there comes a point when hope isn't enough, when dreams clash against reality. And what then, when he is buffeted all around by the storms of fate, will Obama do? Will he sink or will he swim?   <br /> <br />This is an open question, and THE AUDACITY OF HOPE, for all its merits, does not provide an answer.    <br /> <br />The book is still very much worth reading. For the layperson and the political junkie alike, it is a refreshing look at what an inclusive, common sense politics could be. There are also a few startlingly memorable sections that the reader will not soon forget. Obama relates an anecdote about a reporter who had enjoyed reading his first book: \\"`I wonder,' she said, `if you can be that interesting in the next one you write.' By which she meant, I wonder if you can be honest now that youare a U.S. senator. I wonder, too, sometimes.\\" <br /> <br />He is. For a serving American politician, that is high praise. Four stars.
B00009W0WM|5.0|I love this film. No, \\"love\\" is an insufficient word. I could fall into this film with a smile on my face. This DVD is more than just the film lovingly restored into digital video. It includes a great deal of supplemental material, including not one, but two documentaries narrated by Mrs. Bogart herself, Lauren Bacall, as well as the Looney Tunes parody/homage \\"Carrotblanca\\", a radio dramatization with three of the film's stars, and much more. This package justifies buying a DVD player.  <br /> <br />

B00003CXC6|5.0|I just want to comment on the quality and speed of delivery aspect in this case. It was very professional indeed. It is a good...NO...great delivery system. We are very appreciate on how u guys handle. (Even though we are in Indonesia). Once again, Thanks!
B000L43AN4|4.0|No buyer's regret here - I now have plenty to listen to at work over the next few weeks, and probably a lot of the songs will grow on me. Still, printed lyrics would have been nice, considering the $50 I paid to have this album imported. (\\"Deluxe Edition\\" ...? Um, give me a break.) As for the songs, I'd say if you took the best offerings from all 3 albums, released as one 12-song album, you'd have something almost equal to Bone Machine (which is a hell of an endorsment, as Waits fans will know.) Not much was left on the cutting room floor at all, it'd seem, which is not all to the good ... there are misses here, no mistake, some songs (mainly disc 3) which are plain boring (eg, \\"Lucinda\\", \\"What keeps mankind alive\\") or maybe even not actually songs but the soundtrack to Waits's eccentricity (including some spoken-word stuff with little or no music.)    The gems are gems, though: \\"Goodnight Irene\\", \\"Lie to me\\", \\"Low Down\\", \\"Lord I've been changed\\", \\"Bottom of the world\\", \\"Long Way Home,\\" ... these are songs as good as any he's recorded. Mixes of folk, bluesy stuff, 50s rock'n'roll, some surprising covers (including the Ramones) all with Waits's own unique gritty style and strange compassion. They make this album a must-have.    It's a lot of dough to fork over for one album, though, and whether the total material was strong enough for 3 discs is maybe up for question. Still, glad it's in the collection.
B00000J2SO|4.0|First thing first: My actual rating for this would be 4.5 stars, but since i can't put that... If you read my review of Deep Purple's two pack of &#34;Burn/Stormbringer&#34;, then you already have an idea of what I'm going to say. This is a great CD, with awesome songs and great playing, but...is this still Rainbow? I mean... Ritchie Blackmore left DP in 1975 because he didn't like the funkier direction they were heading into, and formed Rainbow with singer Ronnie James Dio. Over the course of 3 records (4 if you count their live CD), THEY invented a new type of heavy rock: big, grandiose, symphonic inspired music, with medieval, renaissance, fantastic imagery in their lyrics, in turn inspiring the euro-metal wave led by Iron Maiden a couple of years later (Maiden founder/bassist Steve Harris is a major Rainbow fan)which still lingers proudly in Europe to this day. But then, in an inexplicable change of heart (apparently motivated by a renewed desire to get radio airplay and to monetize it accordingly.... go figure!), Blackmore decided to once again change direction and forsake their trademark brand of music. Rainbow was always a &#34;musical chairs&#34; band, suffering major lineup changes from record to record, but the departure of Dio over this change in direction definitely marked the closing of an era.<br /><br />Kiss the dragons and dungeons lyrics goodbye , welcome the radio friendly, tender... love songs? Yes, you heard me, love songs! Enter Graham Bonnet. After failing to convince Ian Gillan to join Rainbow, Blackmore then opted to recruit a relative &#34;newcomer&#34; (more on that later), enlisted the help of former DP bandmate Roger Glover as bassist AND producer, and rounded up the lineup with survivor Cozy Powell on drums and Don Airey on keyboards. Despite all the changes in personnel, the band manages to turn in very solid performances overall: Cozy was a powerhouse in and by himself, Roger is an always dependable groove master and Don doesn't feature prominently but makes some very tasteful contributions. The man in Black(more) himself is on his best behavior, riffing and soloing along without overindulging.<br /><br />And that's probably the biggest change from the band's previous incarnation: rather than using the songs as vehicles for virtuosic playing (as had been the case sometimes in the past), the band (and especially Blackmore) chose to shed some of the flash in favor of a more cohesive approach, one that benefited greatly from Roger's pop sensibilities in order to crack the mainstream. The change in musical direction is pretty brutal, but still, I find this brand of rock very much enjoyable (as opposed to the AOR direction the band would adopt subsequently with Joe Lynn Turner...don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with AOR, it's just not my type of music...).<br /><br />Yes, the faces are different, but listening to this CD, sometimes I could swear some of these songs were written for the Stormbringer sessions: listen to &#34;Lady Double Dealer&#34; from Stormbringer and then to &#34;No time to Lose&#34;, &#34;Love's No friend&#34; (a musical, lyrical, and dare I say spiritual successor to DP's &#34;Mistreated&#34;, and one of my all time favorite Rainbow songs), &#34;Danger Zone&#34; and tell me if I'm wrong... Only the tandem vocals of David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes are missing here!These are songs more in the vein of vintage Purple, with perhaps a pinch more of pop, so no &#34;Stargazers&#34; to be found here. The one song that comes closest to that earlier sound is &#34;Eyes of the World&#34;, thanks to its somewhat more elaborate structure and flashy playing.<br /><br />But then you have the aforementioned love songs (and I do mean that: they are definitely love songs, not so much ballads), 2 to be exact: &#34;Making Love&#34; & &#34;Since you've been gone&#34;, that will remind you of Stormbringer's &#34;Soldier of Fortune&#34;, not so much in their sound, but rather in their definite commercial appeal. The first one is the best in my opinion, but the latter would actually become the band's first hit. And what about the &#34;new&#34; guy? Bonnet wasn't exactly a newcomer, but rather an &#34;obscure&#34; choice if you will, having actually started his career in the late 60's in a duo called The Marbles with which he enjoyed his first taste of success (as well as being first noticed by Blackmore) and releasing 3 solo albums by the time he was asked to join Rainbow. Bonnet fares very well here, as his voice and style suit perfectly the new approach that Blackmore was shooting for, which was powerful but radio friendly.<br /><br />Unlike Dio, Bonnet is more of a baritone, but the range and depth of his voice are still impressive, stealing the spotlight on the rockers and softer numbers alike. Graham was nowhere near as operatic as Ronnie was, but still, having only heard a few clips of this lineup performing live at Donington in 1980 (available at youtube), I can definitely say that Bonnet was the right man for the job of succeeding Dio on vocals, powerful enough to cover the earlier material adequately and with confidence to spare brimming on the new album, making a strong impression and successfully taking the band into the new direction they were hoping for and making perfect sense of the album's title, with music that was definitely more &#34;down to earth&#34; than ever before. Too bad it didn't last...<br /><br />I insist, this record is great for everyone: if you like DP, you will like it. If you like Dio era Rainbow (the best, if you ask me...), you will still like it, musical direction change notwithstanding. And if you simply like good music, you'll love it. The reason why I rate it 4.5 and not 5 stars is simply because I feel that the record sounds a little too much like Mk III Deep Purple, and therefore, a little redundant: I mean, why start a new band if you're gonna sound like your old band, right? But if you don't care about this, you will enjoy this a great deal. This is the last Rainbow record that I truly, really enjoy. Get it!st in my opinion, but the latter would actually become the band's first hit. And what about the &#34;new&#34; guy?

B0002ZMITY|5.0|Seriously, I don't know how it got by with an \\"R\\" rating in the Land of the Prudes, but this movie was some funny s#!t. Ya gotta see it, especially if you are a horse lover. ;^)
B0007TKNII|5.0|I can't get enough of this movie. I'd never seen Gerard Butler before, but since seeing him in this wonderful movie, no doubt, I'll never forget him.  The same goes for Emmy Rossum, who plays Christine. She's not only pretty, but is blessed (due to a lot of hard work, as well as a gift) with a beautiful voice. One thing that puzzled me throughout the movie was her tendency to \\"whisper\\" so often. Even when there were only two people in a room . . . she was whispering. It wasn't obvious that the other characters were doing the same in her presence. I don't know what I would do without 'closed captions'-- I guess I wouldn't be able to hear her. In contrast, when she sings, she sings loudly. I wonder if she does the same thing in other movies she's been in. Is this characteristic of her or was this just a case of poor directing? <br /> <br />I'm aware that many people criticize Gerard Butler's signing voice. They obviously haven't paid attention to the fact that the Phantom was NOT supposed to have a \\"beautiful\\" signing voice; that's the part Emmy was supposed to fill, according to the story. The Phantom wrote the songs and operas, and she was his VOICE. According to that, they both did what they were supposed to do, and were who they were supposed to be.  Personally, I liked his voice; and as I stated, Emmy has a beautiful voice.  <br /> <br />In addition to the excellent Andrew Lloyd Webber music, the clever use of black and white segments in the movie contrasted with the color portions, I appreciated the superb acting all cast members. Most of all, my attraction to the movie is the intensity of the possessive love the Phantom has for Christine. When he takes her in his arms, it leaves me with an enviable secure feeling. He shows a strength with that embrace, one most females remember experiencing in their lives, or would like to. <br /> <br />I see this movie every chance I get and relive the aura of this powerful movie over and over without tiring of it.  <br /> <br/>I think rather than to be criticized at all, the movie and its cast members are to be praised for a job well-done.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|Those who are critical because Nora Jones' music is too low keyed and mellow just don't get it. That is what Nora Jones' music is all about. Laid back, soft, and relaxing, easy listening music...Good to kick back, relax and chill with.  <br />As far as her political comments, she's not the first, or the last musically talented performer to incorporate political statements in their music. So put aside this issue, and listen to the instrumentation, and the voice, then dim the lights, relax and enjoy this music the way it was meant to be...
B000A6T1KE|3.0|Chances are, if you are buying this movie, you have already formed an opinion on it by now. As the reviews suggest, it is not an outright success story, but it has to be said it does miss the mark on a lot too. <br />This re-release as a special edition gives a chance to re-evaluate what seems like it will be the last in the Next Generation movies. In viewing again, long after the excitement of a new Trek movie has passed, and the disappointment of something less than was hoped for or hyped has faded, Nemesis turns out to be not such a bad movie after all. The plot revolves around the Romulan Empire, specifically its new leader who has taken power with the Remans, previously the dominated race. This new leader, Schinzon, turns out to be Picards clone, and when Schinzon summons Picard and the Enterprise, the question is - what are his motives. Well, predictably after a period of cautious circling and meaning infused dinners, the motives turn out to be domination and destruction, and our heroes have to save the day - however, along the way the writer (John Logan, also writer of Gladiator) infuses much subtext of families and the dilemna of facing the evil within yourself, and aspiring to become something better - very much the stuff of Trek. <br />For the movie, the writing is not bad, the effects fantastic, and this version boasts a wonderful dts mix as well as 5.1. However, as comfortable as the leads are in their roles, and Tom Hardy fills out his part well also, there is a nagging feeling of tiredness about it all. It's refreshing to see the characters move on - one of the excellent deleted scenes has Picard discuss with data the passage of time marked by occasions such as weddings and funerals, not just without but within too, and it's this sort of character growth that helped inject so much humanity into the classic trek characters - shame they cut that scene. However, the attempt to find a 'personal' villain for Picard does not hit the mark - we never do feel that passionately involved, as the characater is so completely new to us. How much more resonant it might have been if the character was from Picards past, and featured in the TV series, such as Khan was for Kirk. <br />If you already have the movie and are debating whether to get it for the extras, I can only say - do it. The second disc is heaving with extras on all subjects possible. The deleted scenes last almost 30 minutes, and almost all genuinely add something. One can understand the need to trim a movie down, but honestly it feels like this could have been a richer movie with some of these scenes intact. The production, the music, the director, all are featured with extensive interviews. There are two commentaries on the disc, plus one text commentary - if you think you can really watch the movie that often! While mostly interesting, the extras do show less honest heart-searching on the end result, as it does sound like PR plurb, but that's a minor quibble. <br />In short, for a Trek movie this would not be a first choice, but well worth buying to complete the Star trek movie experience. As a special edition, this is well worth it for the extras on display. 7/10 <br />
B0000033IS|5.0|A definite CLASSIC, and I do not use that word loosely. Bought this album when it first came out, and now own the CD. It is timeless. If you like music, any music, then you owe it to yourself to own this record!!! Don't think twice, just buy it.....
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|What a classy movie! This is the successor to the Merchant Ivory movies... Joe Wright does an impeccable job of getting a dense and wordy novel down to the essentials of the story, and still leave time to savour the beauty of England and the cast. <br />The story involves Lizzy and her 4 sisters, following their path to marriage through the minefield of Georgian conventions of 1797 (when the movie was set)and English social mores. The pride and the prejudices come from every angle in this classic and timeless story.  <br />There are several ingredients here that simply make this work to perfection. The cast is for the most part spot on, with Keira Knightley in top form as the headstrong Lizzy, looking, sounding and emoting every inch the part. She is surrounded by Brenda Blethyn and Donald Sutherland as her father and mother, Judi Dench as a Lady Catherine to make you wither in your boots (unless you are Lizzy of course), ravishing Rosamund Pike as her older sister and Tom Hollander as the wimpy cleric, amongst others. The only slight let down, and only because the others are so good, is Matthew MacFadyen, who is perfectly adequately brooding as Darcy, but compared to Colin Firth lacks the charisma to make such a character attractive to Lizzy. <br />Therein lies the problem, if any, with this adaptation - it cannot help but be compared to the impeccable casting and pedigree of the BBC version, which is still the definitive version because of its length, which allows it to stick more rigidly and fully to the book. But this movie must be taken on its own merits, and succeeds where the BBC version could not, in the scale and beauty of the photography - England looks absolutely beautiful here. The mud and dirt are all there - this is no stagey drama - but the beauty of the photography illuminates fantastic interiors of houses rich to poor, and most especially the exteriors of Georgian facades, and natures rich greens and majestic moors. <br />I should also mention the music by Dario Marianelli which is a perfect contributor to the movie, beautifully classic while never dull, somewhat like the ivory tinklings of Michael Nyman (The Piano), but not nearly so minimalist, with lush orchestra where appropriate, and lively jigs for the ball scenes making them seem genuinely like something that would have been fun to attend. <br />Overall, I suggest avoiding comparison with the BBC version, and take this movie as the definitive cinema version, at least. <br />- a p.s. there are plenty of extras on the desk fleshing out history and Jane Austen as well as the usual 'making of' stuff, but most interesting is the alternative ending for the US market - this adds a scene of Lizzy and Darcy together cuddling and expressing their love, which seems much more like a Hollywood add on than the original ending, and adds nothing other than some saccharine for those who cannot find the romance in the story but require it spelt out.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|The Mars Volta has an uncanny way of taking old rock styles, jazz, even metal in some light, and making it new, better and more amazing than it could've ever gotten without them. They have brought Pink Floyd back together metaphorically speaking, as well as led-zeppelin, countless jazz bands, and anything else holy in music except for a low voice and brought it to the public. Ever instrument played is played to its fullest in some form or another, and even the computerized parts tie it all together. This album is a monument to what is good in music, and its a damn shame they had to take it all apart for \\"Amputechture.\\"
B0009W5JS2|2.0|Watching Ice Cube play the hard guy would-be spy makes you realise - wow! Vin Diesel actually DID have charisma after all!  <br />All pretensions to the part being about spying and stealth are out of the window - the first movie had an appeal of being like a Bond movie on steroids; This one is just action, and could be any action franchise a few movies in. In fact, in terms of substance this could easily have been direct to video for all the weight the star and story carry... however, there are bangs for your buck on display here.. the actions scenes are as big budget as they are ludicrous. The opening scene has some promise with Samuel Jackson taking on the bad guys in his own headquarters, but when he steps into the wierd custom job car you know there is a franchise identity crisis on the way - is this XXX or Fast and Furious 4??  <br />In short, this is brainless action - budget is on the screen, but not with the script. Ice Cube plods through the role giving it no heart, panache, or even self knowing parody. Daniel Defoe and Samuel Jackson should know better. <br />
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is a favorite novel, and I admit I'm \\"prejudiced\\" in its favor.  But this adaption won my full affection.  Keira Knightley turns in an absolutely perfect portrayal of Elizabeth Bennett.  The rest of the cast is terrific as well, including very nice portrayals by Donald Sutherland and Rosamund Pike.      The scene at the dinner table where Elizabeth learns that Mr. Darcy has unexpectedly saved her sister's honor, and the library scene where she tells her father that she truly does love Mr. Darcy are just exquisitely played by Miss Knightley, and I can watch them over and over.    A great DVD that I would highly recommend for all Jane Austen fans.
0767817710|4.0|Sam Raimi was still untamed by Hollywood, and determined to be as innovative as possible, when he did this Western. The overall memory you will take away with you, is not the performances (which are fine, but hampered by the shallow characterisation in the script) but the distinctive angles and point of view shots that made the Evil Dead series so memorable.  <br />The story is stolen from a number of different famous spaghetti Westerns - virtually everything you see could be described as an homage to one spaghetti Western or other, such as Sharon Stone's motivation, which is almsot straight from 'Once Uopn a time in the West. Even the music has Jews harps and cracking whips... Sadly, the effect is only to remind you that they don't make them like they used to. ...  <br />The story is uncomplicated - Sharon Stone is the (wo)man with no name who rides into town bent on revenge, with the town mayor (Gene Hackman) in her sights. Hackman rules the town with an iron fist, and he has organised a gunfight competition, bringing the fastest shootists around to win the cash prize. Also in the competition are his son (Leo deCaprio) and unwilling participator The Preacher (Russell Crowe).  <br />Sharon Stone had a producers role here, and isisted on the casting of then-unknowns Leonardio DeCaprio, and Russell Crowe.. the casting alone is enough reason to buy this film. Gene Hackman gives a menacing performance, and Stone is OK, but truth be told unconvincing in the role.  <br />In short, this is a wild ride of a film, with lots to enjoy in the acting line-up and highly stylised visual look. Just don't expect something thought provoking - This is a comic book style version of a Western.. it's ironic that Raimi had an even more comic book style here than he did in Spiderman! Well worth its budget cost for the curioisty value.. <br />
B000I0QK74|5.0|Wonderful Christmas CD by James Taylor and the price is unbeatable compared to other comparable collections

079073804X|5.0|I am a fully grown man and i have to say that i've seen a gazillion horror movies and this is the only movie EVER, and i mean EVER to scare me. Buy it but don't watch it alone in the dark.
B00005JPDJ|5.0|We watched this movie in the theatre, and we noticed that everyone around us was enthralled by it. It is a wonderfully written story, beautifully acted, and very entertaining. This is a movie for those who are happy, love life, and love. This is a keeper - I can't wait for the dvd to be released so I can own it.
B000IMUYJM|1.0|First off i bought this movie based on the first five reviews and didn't bother to read everyone elses, i'll never make that mistake again. I consider myself a horror fan and i'll watch a movie just to say i seen it, if i can sit through 28 Days Later i can sit through anything. This is quite possibly the worst horror movie ever made with the exception of 28 Days Later and the first Sleepaway Camp. It is so slow its pathetic to the point of going to sleep but i finished it anyway because i wasted my money on it. You know most horror movies start out slow and pick up in the middle but thats not the case here. Its fine not to kill the killer but at least let me see who he is or something. Is that supposed to do something for me because he's still a mystery or what? In summary this movie may have scared me 25 years ago when i was three, but now it just makes me not want to watch horror films anymore. I wish those people that gave it five stars would give me my 18 dollars back. Stay away from this movie unless you have money to throw away, even then throw it away on something else. Thank you.
0757302661|2.0|I was so excited to read this book.  I choose this over some of the other options because this seemed like the original source of the information.  But as I started reading it, I started to feel manipulated.  There are so many references in the book to \\"what you will practice in class\\".  And there is even a part that states \\"you will get these cue cards from your instructor\\".  I bought this book because I didn't have the $300 bucks to spend taking a live class and I don't appreciate that they sell it as a stand alone book, but that it is written as an accompaniement to a birth class.   <br /> <br />I didn't feel as though I got enough from the book alone to help me in any way and as I had already done a lot of reading on childbirth, none of the extra information was anything new to me. <br /> <br />Skip this book.  I wish I had.
B000M341QE|2.0|\\"Could it have been any nastier?\\"  Those were my words upon walking out of the theater after seeing this raunchy, bloody mess of a movie that could just as well have been called \\"Gangs of Boston.\\"  The killings got so absurd toward the end that many in the audience broke out laughing.  Scorsese decides all the main characters have to die a grisly death and ends with a nihilistic image that I suppose perfectly ties together the nihilism of this film.  Jack Nicholson's performance aside, there's very little of anything to recommend in this excessive, overdone, failed attempt at a thriller.  The plot twists get preposterous, and the relentless nastiness gets insufferable after about an hour.
B000M341QE|5.0|Once again, Scorsese is at the top of HIS game. All the things that made his past movies work, added with an excellent plot show why this movie could be his first Oscar win or best director. Nicholson gives the performance that we are used to Jack giving; eccentric, enigmatic, and at times even funny. However, the rest of the cast is nearly flawless. DiCaprio is brilliant, Scorsese seems to bring this out of him more than any other director. Damon, who I am honestly not a huge fan of, was excellent. Wahlberg, Baldwin, and Sheen portray their characters very well. The plot was very well directed onto screen, a very character driven storyline. The story weaves and cross weaves on screen excellently and is pretty easy to follow. Once again Scorsese's camera work is phenomenal, reminiscent to all of his classics.  <br />Now, I have seen alot of Scorsese bashers online saying, \\"Too much violence and gore\\", or, \\"Too foul mouthed.\\" Ok. Scorsese will never direct a Disney classic, so to walk in and expect a mob film of his to be sqeaky clean...you are crazy. The language and the violence are in a way needed to the characters personality. I mean, did you expect to see a cake and ice cream party amongst the characters?  <br />In closing, this movie was worth waiting for. The plot, characters, and direction of this movie were put together the way Scorsese only can do. If you loved his classics, you will love this movie.
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|Instead of Jane walking to and reclining on Mr. Rochester when they begin to kiss in the next to last scene, I would have had Jane walk to Mr. R and sit down on his lap, and then begin kissing him. Reclining was a little too modern although I realize they were wearing too many clothes to be really \\"modern\\", but sitting on his lap was straight out of the book and would have worked.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This is a must-see, must know documentary. It is time that we here in the United States get off our high horse and realize that we can no longer be ignorant in regards to environmental issues. Al Gore makes his points clear and easy to understand for anyone. This should be mandatory viewing for everyone - especially in our government for those politicians driven by donations and favors from special interest groups. We need to realize that we need to do something now - we only have this one Earth, there will be no second chance and no quick fix. We all need to change our mind set regarding energy consumption, recycling and environmental protection. In the United States we get lazier and more wasteful each day, and we need to put a stop to that or our future generations will not survive. Everyone can do their part and the Al Gore's website shows that very clearly - we just need to wake up!!! And this film is definitely a wake up call!
B00005JKNF|5.0|I love this movie!  Each time I watch it, I notice something different or new that I'd never seen before.  Everyone in it is fantastic.  Maggie Smith is hilarious as Lady Trentham and Helen Mirren breaks your heart as Mrs. Wilson.  Clive Owen is truly smoldering in his role!  This is one of my favorite movies to pop in on a gloomy Sunday afternoon (of which there are quite a few in Seattle).
B0002WYS6S|5.0|The 1st time I watched this show was on Rave HD at 330am and I could go to sleep.  I stayed up 'till about 6am having to work in the morning.  I'm saying this was Phenomenal.  I loved it!!!  Great Sound and Awsome Show.  Next day I went searching for this DVD because I had to have it.  I have watched it a couple of times, already!

0765315246|2.0|I was suckered into buying this book based upon the glowing comments of how it won awards and the author is following in the footsteps of the great Robert Heinlein and the like. I read about 45 pages and threw it against the wall. The problem is the characters are absolutely flat and lifeless. You couldn't distinguish the voice or characteristics of one character from another. A story has got to be about people, not stuff that happens. Scalzi can't write people, at least as judged by what I see here.<br /><br />I'm giving it two stars because it was readable enough; it simply failed to engage me. Maybe it would be okay reading for a kid, or someone who picked it up in a lazy frame of mind and didn't expect much.<br /><br />P.S. I feel a bit awkward posting this, in that I see John Scalzi himself has visited this site. Here I am, having written nothing myself, posting a scathing comment about another human being who has gone public with his creativity. It's hardly fair, to snipe from the shadows like this. There's something to be said for the aphorism that the very worst author is worth more than all the critics who have ever lived. Well, I respect those who make the effort to write. Good luck to all of you, and I'm not claiming to possess the entire truth. But this is how I reacted, and it's one data point of many.
B000002I2G|5.0|I don't care if it sounds \\"pop.\\" I don't care if it has strings. I don't care who thinks the album is a \\"sell out.\\" I've even heard the mighty Jim Morrison didn't much like it, but I don't care, I just don't care. <br /> <br />I love it. <br /> <br />Sure, \\"Morrison Hotel\\" and \\"LA Woman\\" ARE funkier. \\"The Doors\\" is the record that set THE standard for this kind of music (the boys didn't make \\"Strange Days\\" for me, so I won't comment about it). <br /> <br />Regardless, this is a solid, meaty record that I have enjoyed on a regular basis since the day it dropped, and I'm as serious a Doors fan as anyone who will read this. What really matters is that the record is fun (yes, it is, and it's okay to be fun), it's cool, and it is the Doors, for pity's sake. What more do you want? <br /> <br />When I hear people quibble about this album, I'm always reminded of the people who claim that there are too many songs on the Beatles' \\"White album.\\" No there weren't, and there's nothing at all wrong with this record either. <br /> <br />The song, \\"Soft Parade\\" has always been a favorite of mine, and I can dance to \\"Touch Me\\" without beer. What else do you need? <br /> <br />No qualifications. This is a great record. Try it out. <br />

0380789035|3.0|This book came recommended to me by several students and a couple of friends, so I read it. It wasn't boring, as some of the other customer reviewers have said. It definitely kept me turning the pages. I enjoyed the symbolism, the allusions, the story telling. Until...about midway through the book I figured out two of the \\"big\\" things that were going to happen in th end. I kept reading, hoping I was wrong (because there's nothing worse to me than predictiing the ending and then being right), but when all was said and done I had both of the big \\"surprises\\" pegged. Maybe they weren't meant to be surprises. Maybe I was supposed to be able to predict the ending and so I'm complaining about something that was as it was intended. Shrug. It was a decent read on a long, slow day curled up with my dog beside me. Other than that, just sort of \\"eh.\\" I like twists I can't see coming, not the ones I can see approaching from miles away.
1598561634|5.0|That's right, this is IT! When it comes time to get serious about Biblical research, this is THE book to have. Whether the professor has recommended it or the school requires it, this is the book you need to proceed. I wouldn't worry too much about which size type you order (the large vs the smaller edition), when you get to this stage in the game the damage is done anyway;) Save up, buy it, move on. That much is simple.

Where is the soul,the passion, and the heartache? This CD made me want call the suicide hotline. Although if you have Insomnia this is the perfect cure.

0060536357|5.0|...-F. Ross Johnson, President & Chief Executive, RJR Nabisco<br /><br />That phrase dots Burrough and Helyar's work - mentioned several times throughout the course of the book- and encapsulates the kind of colorful nonfictional story-telling that's at it's best here. The authors do a masterful job of telling a story about what was the biggest business deal in history and the complexity of the big personalities, big egos, big fees and big everything that encompassed it. From Forstman Little's Crusade Against Junk Bonds (caps intended), to First Boston's out-of-nowhere bid that inevitably set up the KKR win, this book is filled with an abyss of unputdownable plots and subplots that leaves one edu-tained from start to finish.<br /><br />One of the best things about this book is how effectually the authors try to get inside the heads of the players and mini-players in a manner that adds both color to the story telling and insight into the deal. Like this passage:<br /><br />\\"Around eleven o'clock they were joined by Matthew Rosen, the team's thirty-six-year-old tax counsel.  Rosen was a lawyer from the 'Thirtysome-thing' crowd: Italian suits, tassled loafers, an office crammed with modern-art [Kandisky likenesses I hear my mind wondering as a reader?], the kind of early 1970s rabble-rouser embarrassed to tell his Swarthmore class reunion he now made millions sniffing out tax loopholes for corporate takeovers\\".<br /><br />Some educational takeaways include the role of junk bonds, the intricacies as well as benefits/costs of LBOs with the help of management (i.e. friendly) vs. hostile takeovers, moral hazard/conflicts of interest issues involving banks and financial advisors, the crucial role of good valuation work and thorough due diligence, managing public relations, deal confidentiality, managing Board of Directors relations, information security and bid strategy.  Will one be ready to enact one's first billion dollar LBO after completing this book? Not yet. I would Rick Rikerten's Book \\"Buyout: The Insider's Guide to Buying Your Own Company\\" if you are looking to gain practical insight on more compact deals for that.<br /><br />A book I came across entitled, \\"The New Financial Capitalists: Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Creation of Corporate Value\\" by George Baker and George Davis Smith would also complement the reading of Burrough's and Helyar's book quite well. The latter is a bit more academic than Barbarians At The Gate but it's often both fun and educational to look at some of the same topic matter from different angles.<br /><br />As far as the history making story emboldened on every page of this book, as the authors say \\"You couldn't make this stuff up.\\"<br /><br />---<br />Vel primus vel cum primis<br />---Insider's Guide to Buying Your Own Company\\" if you are looking to gain practical insight on more compact deals for that.

0895260131|5.0|Very informative, well written and helpful.  I highly recommend Mr Spenser's work.  Thanks.  Again, not a cheerful message, but one everyone interested in the subject should read.
0743289412|1.0|I am a very avid reader of Stephen King and was delighted that he had brought out a new book BUT what a disappointment. So incredibly dull, really arduous to try and trudge through. Nothing gripping about it and I agree with nearly everyone who thought the same. 'Bool'... ugh. Please - I will stick to re-reading brilliant brilliant novels like The Long Walk, Cujo, Carrie, Four Past Midnight.... definite stayers.  <br /> <br />DO NOT let this be the first Stephen King novel you read.
B000M5AJQS|4.0|I'll be honest: I wasn't that big a fan of Gangs of New York. The story was just not interesting at all and the only thing that saved it was the production values and the performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. The Aviator was a good movie but the main problem was that it didn't seem like a film you can watch over and over but rather something that was good whenever you watched it, whether it was recently or not. The Departed, revisiting territory seen in Goodfellas, was immediately jumped on as one of Scorsese's best. Is it, or is it just simply the best he's done in years, since possibly Casino but definately since Goodfellas? Maybe. <br /> <br />The main man in the Departed is Frank Costello, a crime boss in Boston. A particularly nasty and blunt fellow and dealing with many illegal practices, the police have been after him for years. Doesn't help that he's got an informant in the police department named Colin Sullivan. The police, headed by officers Queenan and Dignam, decide they need their own informant in Costello's crew. In comes Billy Costigan, who after a stint in prison gets accepted in Costello's crew but both sides know a rat exists so both Billy and Colin have to outwit each other without actually meeting. <br /> <br />When a film is mentioned as being a director's best since whatever, it always nags me since that's not always the case. With the Departed, coming after simply ok films like Aviator or Gangs and Bringing Up the Dead, it's easy to say that it's Scorsese's best since his output isn't like what we've had recently. It's an exciting movie filled with twists and turns but at the same time it seems like a movie where it feels like Scorsese's niche. In other words, he knows how to make mob movies and is good at it. The only thing is that the story seems to twist without being shocking. Certain plot points don't have as much kick as they should and at the end, one character out of the blue says his connection with Costello, it's like \\"him? where the hellwas he the entire movie?\\" <br /> <br />However, the casting is great with the accompanying performances through the roof. Jack Nicholson, seen in such comedies as Something's Gotta Give and Anger Management, it's finally nice to see \\"actor Jack\\" back and not the superstar. And once-reviled Leonard DiCaprio proves there's more to him than just a handsome face. Supporting players also work from scene stealer Mark Wahlberg to Alec Baldwin but strangely the only one I felt didn't work was one of the key ones. Matt Damon felt slightly miscast since I never got that feeling that this guy was corrupt and misleading. When he starts swearing a lot near the end or being kind of a jerk to love interest Vera Farmiga's character, it just seems...off. Of course it's probably just me. <br /> <br />It's too bad that the DVD cover is so classy when the special features seem light. Yeah the Scorsese documentary is long and informative but there just doesn't seem to be enough features for this to be the definitive Departed DVD. Even the Aviator was more packed than this. The exclusion of a Scorsese commentary is one thing but an extensive making-of about the filming is kind of inexcusable. Look for an eventual double-dip in the near future. <br /> <br />I will admit that the Departed was a lot of fun and I'd recommend it to buy but this is a career highlight that hasn't had one in almost 20 years.
B00000JNNY|5.0|I just want to say that I have never been dissapointed with Amazon and when I had a problem with a seller they took care of it immediately.

The first lyrics of the first track really open the album well: \\"I believe that gas is too damn high, ain't nothin' more American than Momma's apple pie...\\"  I'm not going to preview each track for you, but I will tell you that there are several stand out tracks:  \\"Before She Does\\"  \\"Sinners Like Me\\"  \\"What I almost Was\\"  \\"The Hard Way\\"  and \\"Livin' Part of Life\\"  Those are just my favorites, the other tracks are great too!!!    If you like good ole real country music, you'll like this album.    Church has a great voice and this album is well produced.  It's got some slower songs as well as some upbeat party songs that'll really get your boots tapping along.  If \\"Livin' Part of Life\\" doesn't make you want to sing along or get up and karaoke, there's something wrong with you!!  It's a really fun, easy song that's hard not to like!!!!   This cd will make you forget your worries for 47 minutes  Preview the tracks and you'll see what I mean.  Fun cd all around!!
B000KX0IOK|5.0|HALF NELSON is one of those rare breed of films that takes a unique idea, wraps it in an intelligent script, finds the perfect actors to bring the story to life, and does it all on a minimal budget that goes for the jugular rather than the glitz of promotion.  It is a little miracle of a movie.<br /><br />Dan Dunne (Ryan Gosling in a breakout performance) is an idealistic, fervent teacher recently graduated from college with a profound desire to make things different - in education and in the world.  He is assigned to a junior high school in the ghetto where he is one of the rare white teachers for a black and Hispanic population: the principal is a hardnosed black lady who has rigid rules about curriculum and tutorial techniques.  Dunne teaches his own way, involving his students in understanding rather than memorizing history.  He is committed to his ideals but his technique is very student friendly and his class respects his demeanor.  Very subtly he draws out the significance of important historical events, allowing the students to embrace the essence of civil rights rather than the rhetoric of the usual classroom approach.<br /><br />Dunne has a problem: he has learned to temper his frustrations and ambitions by escaping into drugs and he uses cocaine to soften his world. The 'crisis' of the story is the juncture when his brightest student Drey (Shareeka Epps in a stunning performance) discovers Dunne's secret when she catches him smoking crack in the very gym where Dunne is coaching an all-girl basketball team.  With minimal words and maximal eye contact and tacit understanding Dunne and Drey bond.  Drey is lonely: her brother is in prison for dealing drugs, her mother is works double time as a security officer to support them, and her brother's friend Frank (Anthony Mackie) coerces Drey into delivering drugs to his clients.  How the bond between Dunne and Drey plays is the message of the film.  This is not a physical love relationship but a sensitive fulfillment of needs between two bright people on the cusp of society's flaws.<br /><br />Ryan Fleck directs this film with the most subtle and sensitive technique, allowing us to view the flaws as well as the virtues of his characters. The script written by both Fleck and Anna Boden is creative in the classroom communication and minimal in the interplay outside the classroom, allowing the words to be superceded by eye messages and silence that is deafening.  Gosling and Epps are brilliant in their ability to keep their characters credible, never opting for histrionics, always choosing to underplay potentially volatile scenes.  The supporting cast is equally fine with the majority of the actors being in their first film and the others are solid professionals from previous quiet films. HALF NELSON is a wholly successful accomplishment, a film whose value will grow through repeated viewings and with history of cinema.

B00005GL0Q|5.0|Containing half a dozen hits plus an enthusiastic ensemble of extras all reflecting well the direction of what the most ingenious/versatile rock band in history chose to create. Although a few tracks might incline the typical FabFan to question the group's relevance to the free world, such quirks are to be expected from any album ever recorded. If by chance this CD is not yet part of your Beatles collection, make room for it without a hint of disappointment - easily one of the greats by the greatest.
B000M4RG42|2.0|World War Two was the greatest cause of all time--the elimination of the intolerable Japanese and German militarism and oppression.  This film is about one of the pivotal events in one of the great battles of the Pacific War, and as such, my expectations were high that this would be a film that inspires and inspirits the viewer.  Such is not the case.  The characterizations in this film are one-dimensional, and the problems of the protagonists in dealing with their sudden celebrity as the Iwo Jima flag raisers fail to engage the viewer with other than a consistent depressing downbeat tone.  This is a film that mistakes melancholy for profundity.  The Film simply does not manage to effectively connect the viewer with either the great events of the heroic capture of Iwo Jima by the US Marines, or the problems of the main characters in the aftermath of the battle.<br /><br />I do not think that it is saying too much that this film loses sight of its main objective: to entertain the viewer.  Instead, it seems determined to focus on the point that the men who became sudden celebrities as the flag raisers were ordinary men, with ordinary flaws in a society that itself was not without flaws.  We know that.  We also know that Iwo Jima was a battle in which such ordinary men performed a fateful service for America and mankind, while asking for nothing in return other than the chance of serving their country and the hope of returning to it intact in mind and body.  Director Clint Eastwood misses this point completely, and what could have been an inspiring and entertaining story instead becomes a fizzle that few viewers will return to a second time.<br /><br />I understand that Eastwood is making a film that does focus on heroism and patriotism on Iwo Jima--about the Japanese defenders there, if you can believe it.  I think I'll pass that one up.
B00006HYQ5|5.0|I decided to buy this particular mouse because I got myself a new ThinkPad and wanted to have a mouse that \\"matched\\" my laptop in terms of appearance. I also wanted a smaller mouse for when I am on the road. What I received however was much more than that! <br />This mouse has been so far the best mouse I have ever used! It is small, so it feels a little bit strange in the beginning, but extremely precise and sensitive in its response to hand movements. I had read that after you get used to it then all other mouses seem unnecessarily big and bulky and I need to say that this is true. After using this mouse at home all other mouses I have used at work don't even come close! The material it is made from is also very nice, as it provides a very nice grip. As per the looks, the red-lighted scrolling wheel makes it just fantastic! Overall I am very pleased with my purchase and I strongly recommend it. Two thumbs up!

071563318X|1.0|Don't be fooled into thinking this book is going to be funny.  It's not.<br /><br />There is exactly one joke - The book is a serious-minded survival guide meant to prepare the masses for an event that is rooted in fiction, fantasy and legend and will never come to pass.  That's it, there is your joke.  Nothing else is funny.  The writing is not funny.  The content is not funny.  The case studies are not funny.  And that one joke is not enough to carry an entire book.<br /><br />Yeah, I know it's a tongue-in-cheek send-up of the whole zombie genre, but the book fails to deliver when it takes the subject matter too seriously.  The entire book reads like an actual survival guide - dry, boring, matter-of-fact, instructions, lists and examples that, collectively, are better suited as a tech school night course in zombie attack survival than as leisure reading.<br /><br />It's like publishing an owner's manual for a non-existent Flying Car. You get a giggle from the premise but reading about how often you are supposed to change the oil or where the fuse panel is, is just plain dull.<br /><br />I usually take away something from every book I read, but I have been unable to identify what that something was in this book.  Maybe it's the comfort in knowing if there is a local/national/global zombie crisis then I'll be more prepared than the neighbor that didn't read the book.  So now I've got that going for me...<br /><br />Zombies aren't coming so there is no need for a book that very soberly attempts to prepare us for that event.  However, there is always room on the shelf for a fiction book that pokes fun at Zombies and their attempt to conquer the mundane world inhabited by us non-zoms...but I guess we'll have to keep waiting for that one.
B000KCHZK6|4.0|While the songs may not be as catchy or easily accessible as the ones on her first two albums, the work is just as strong and much more personal. Let me state this for the record: I am not a Bush hater. I wouldn't say I'm a supporter, I'm more moderate, but I have grown very tired of the nonstop bashing the last few years. When I first heard this album and all of the political \\"commentary,\\" I was a little disapointed and I might have rolled my eyes once or twice. But then, I forget if it was on my fourteenth or fiftteenth listen, I noticed I couldn't stop playing the freakin' album, and I said to myself: \\"You know what? I may not feel the same way Norah does, but that doesn't change the fact that this is some great music.\\" And you know how I said it may not be as catchy as her first two albums? It isn't at first, but it quickly grows on you, and before you know it you're hooked.
B000067CPX|5.0|RHCP is appealing to younger audiences like myself (I'm 20) and I fell in love with this band when Californication came out.

Anyway a friend of mine told me the album was lame (but he's a hardcore AFI fan)after hearing it through once I was like wow it goes up and down. My picks: \\"Can't Stop\\" \\"Don't Forget Me\\" \\"Venice Queen\\" and \\"Minor Thing.\\"

There may be better individual recordings, but as a set of four this is a stone cold bargain.  I would highly recommend this cd.

0618477942|5.0|I read this on recommendation from a bookstore professional. I've never read a graphic novel. She cautioned me about some of the drawings, but there is nothing that isn't in a PG13 movie anyway, and this is more appropriate by far!! This was a great reading adventure not only because of the drawings, but because it is so beautifully written as well. The subtleties of A.B.'s drawings are as interesting as the sensitive way she tells her story. They really balanced each other, telling a story any of us who grew up in the 60's/70's can relate to. There were no labels for the various \\"dysfunctions\\" as there are today and children raised by compulsive people had no way to interpret the terrain. Yet, no matter what, most children love their parents, as evidenced by the efforts of both Alison and her mother & father. This is an exceptionally well exceucted memoir. I loved it! It will be my next book club choice for discussion.

B00005JNNZ|5.0|If you heard Samuel L. Jackson discuss Coach Carter on the typical media blitz before the movie's release, you could tell this was a truly special role in his dynamite career. And the message delivered shows how sports - placed in its proper perspective - can boost young men to better understand the game of life.<br /><br />Ken Carter is a successful sporting goods owner who accepts the head coaching position at Richmond (Ca.) High School, where he had been a top athlete back in the day. But the game isn't all that Carter is coaching; he institutes written contracts for each player that includes behavior, dress code and grade stipulations.<br /><br />In 1999, Carter gained national attention when he benched his undefeated team due to poor academic achievement by 15 of the 45 players. Not only was the gym closed, there was a ban on all basketball-related activities and he was prepared to cancel the rest of the season, even with a bitter backlash from school officials, fans, players & their family members.<br /><br />Jackson does an outstanding job in portraying a coach who understood that a game can teach crucial lessons in life. Rick Gonzalez (Timo Cruz), Nana Gbewonyo (Junior Battle) and Ashanti (Kyra) also do great jobs, though the entire cast really clicked with the script.<br /><br />Coach Carter is not just a sports movie and its theme is very important for adults as much as it is for the athletes.

B00005JPAM|4.0|Portrays those trajic events of September 1997 as well as can be expected in a movie, but Mirren's performance is spell-binding in it's portrayal of Her Majesty's reaction to them.  I for one never believed that the monarchy was seriously under threat.  It was her subject's dismay and disapproval of the queen's ice-cool manner that is supposed to express dignity and fortitude in the face of extremis that had to change.  In our present touchy-feely age  where anything goes and public displays of emotion encouraged, this kind of stoicism is becoming increasingly misunderstood by later generations of H.M.'s subjects.  All this excessive formality had to go - or at least bring us some blessed relief from it all!  However, lessons have been learned, scars are healing and the queen has recovered her undoubted popularity here in Great Britain.  I think that Her Majesty The Queen is a woman that her subjects have always admired and respected, if not loved - until now maybe.  One has to remember that this is a movie and not a documentary.  Sadly, some take their feeble knowledge of history from films of this kind however inaccurate, but in this case in the absence of known facts one can only speculate and this film must come close to the truth of what has been concealed from us all.  Well worth taking a peek...

Some of the villains are just too unreal to be believed, but I liked the characters that made up the Camel Club enough to want to see them again.  I hope The Collectors is a step up, because it involves them again, and \\"Oliver Stone\\" is a pretty awesome group leader.

It goes over the materials in a much more thorough way.  I find myself listening to it every day, over and over again, and each day i am learning more and more.  This is an excellent product and i would highly recommend it.
B00007E8O5|5.0|Jerry Cantrell it appears from the first note of this cd was more than just the guitarist for Alice In Chains...the atomsphere he creates here is nothing short of amazing! His singing is as strong as his guitar and I am very impressed with this cd as it really has Jerry bringing it all together...as one reviewer remarked the first cd Bogey Depot was a solo album from a member of a band...this cd is far superior in that it has its own personality and takes you down in the hole of Jerry's soul...get it play it and be glad that with all the junk metal being made lately this is real rock ....and it will make you appreciate real talent and creativity!
B0009I7NNA|3.0|Don't get me wrong i am a big fan of avenge but they have weird time changes and drumming is all double bass and snare.  The guitars when they are actually playing together sounds great great until they do a stupid out of no where time change.  M shadow is one of the best singers.  but you can't have a great singer with weird non flowing music.

B000KGGLCU|4.0|I love this DVD/CD.  I saw it on NBC and it's great to see the concert the way Madonna wanted it to be seen, love it or hate it, but \\"Live to Tell\\" was a powerful performance.  The only reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars is the CD in quite incomplete.  \\"Get Together\\", \\"Live to Tell\\" as well as several other great songs were not included!!!  other than that, a great package.
B000BTGY1O|4.0|We had not planned to watch \\"Breakfast At Tiffany's\\" (1961) on our movie night, but when the song \\"Moon River\\" started playing, it was hard not to get caught up in the film. The opening scene has got to be one of the most haunting in film history, with Audrey Hepburn strolling down a Manhattan street at five o'clock in the morning, glamorously attired, a paper cup of coffee in hand, nibbling a pastry, while pausing to gaze longingly into the window of Tiffany's jewery store. Never has anyone looked so lost.    Made at the dawn of the sexual revolution, the film captures the angst of modern life, with the all the loneliness, the frantic striving for wealth at any price, seeking in material pleasures a happiness which remains elusive. The \\"Holly Golightly\\" character, nimbly portrayed by Miss Hepburn, embodies the lifestyle of so many contemporary young women, sans the Givenchy gowns, in whose lives there have often been many lovers but very little true love. The George Peppard character, \\"Paul\\" the writer-gigolo, was shocking at the time the film debuted. He, too, like so many modern people, knows a lot about sex but nothing of love. He longs for love, nevertheless. Paul, like Holly, is trapped in a lifestyle from which there seems to be no escape. Hope is presented in the awakening of love, and the desire for commitment, from which Holly flees like a bird.    The film would be nothing without the Henry Mancini song \\"Moon River,\\" written for Audrey's limited vocal range. Although the words speak of a youthful desire to see the world, when Audrey sings it, she captures a deeper level of meaning, an intense yearning for home, for a family setting that is no more. It is essentially a mourning of lost innocence. Holly had lost her innocence by age fourteen, when she married a man old enough to be her father; instead of being a much-needed parent, he became a lover, and perhaps that is what set her on the path to promiscuity. Underneath her carefree exterior, she is tormented at the very core of her being, as is demonstrated when she smashes up her apartment upon hearing the that her only brother has died.    When hearing the song \\"Moon River\\" as a child, I always thought of the river not far from our house. It was a yellow muddy river due to the cow manure and silt from the fields, but on a summer night, beneath the glimmering of the moon, it became beautifully surreal, connoting the magic and mystery of places far away. How often the youthful longing to see the world is replaced with the nostalgia for home, after the world has been seen and tasted. There is no going back home, only going forward, while creating structures of stability for the new generation. Paul and Holly standing in the rain at the end of \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's,\\" hugging a soggy cat, while a choir sings \\"Moon River\\" in the background, is almost like a gleam of promise. Amid the despair, depravity and chaos of modernity, a man and woman can still find each other, commit to each other, and build a life of meaning for themselves and for others.

0714845183|4.0|Would love to have ordered the hardcover for a coffee table book but this one does just fine for the cost and over-seas shipping it would have taken for the hardcover.  Lots of information on J W Waterhouse and great pictures. It even has some of his less known works and pictures that you can't find prints for.  A true keep sake and treasure for those who are interested in this artist and his time.  Oh, and a few of the house guests, students, have even asked to borrow the book. First table book to have created some interesting conversations.
B000I5X81A|4.0|I think the production perhaps makes the road a bit smoother than it should be.  For the most part, this CD is JJ Cale--a strong bluesy, rootsy kind of groove that's very listenable.  The problem is I think the too smooth production style wore the gravel off the road--and that gravel is what makes JJ Cale so good.   <br /> <br />From the first, \\"Danger\\" sets the scene. The song's dark and deep with an unmistakable bayou air.  Some of my favorites are \\"Sporting Life Blues\\", \\"Heads in Georgia\\" and \\"Missing Persons.\\"  <br />It's great to hear both Clapton and Cale singing on \\"Sporting Life.\\" This is definitely a song that could use just a little more 'edge' though.   <br /> <br />If you came for Clapton, you may be disappointed.  For the most part, this CD is Cale's music--which was a strong influence on Clapton in the 70's.   <br /> <br />

As a teenager, my mom tried to get me to watch and I was turned off by the accents and the portrayl of the mountain folk.  Now that I am older (and have an MA in Appalachian Literature), I am able to see the masterful film making and understand why Cooper won the Oscar.  This film is also more about religious and spiritual redemption.  It is an awesome picuture!!!!
0375703764|5.0|I read this book back in 2000 and for some reason now while watching tonight's episode of LOST, it just came to mind.  There is so much already that has been written about this book that there can't be much more to say. So, I guess my review is more a reflection - a book that after five/six years still comes back to me occasionally.  I remember those dark rooms; a house that could envelope you forever.
B000002GQH|5.0|I used to listen to this and other Moody Blues albums on both vinyl and 8-track endlessly in. I *finally* got around to getting the CDs recently and the remaster of this album is STUNNING. I'm always a bit afraid of remastering because often the mix changes to suit the engineers or the artists as they think \\"it should have been\\". My opinion of this remaster is that it's a beautiful technology update that doesn't disturb the original music from the 1960's.

B000ETQRCM|4.0|The first four tunes off Pearl Jam's self-titled CD are vintage: pained vocals, heavyweight guitar riffs, crashing cymbals, slinky guitar solos - anger and despair. On song one, \\"Life Wasted,\\" Eddie Vedder leaves his hang-ups, demons and depression in the past, seemingly getting it all out in the space of four minutes. (Note: The pile-driver riff heard at the end of the song was stolen by PJ from The M's album [[ASIN:B000E115CM Future Women]], which was released earlier in 2006; listen to the song \\"Never Do This Again\\" and see if you don't agree.) \\"Life Wasted\\" boasts a catchy riff and great lyrics: \\"I escaped it/a life wasted/I'm never going back again.\\" The song is so good it even gets its own organ-laced reprise later on in the CD.<br /><br />From intensely personal revelations like the lyrics on \\"Life Wasted\\" to thinking on a more global level (\\"World Wide Suicide,\\" \\"Unemployable,\\" \\"Army Reserve\\"), Vedder and his bandmates, as usual, let it all hang out. Vedder's sincere vocal delivery on this CD will once again strike a chord (no pun intended) with his fans. Many of Vedder's lyrics on \\"Pearl Jam\\" deal with today's tensions over beliefs, such as \\"Markers in the Sand,\\" which bemoans the stupidity of fighting over religious practices. The album's most commercial-sounding moment occurs on \\"Unemployable,\\" which has great harmonic vocals and stellar guitar work in the background. Vedder's lyrics at the end of the song sound as if he's saying \\"Scared of life, scared of death,\\" which would have been better than what he actually wrote (in my opinion), but it's still one of the album's best songs and would have been a great single. Even the lighthearted fare on this CD is good: \\"Big Wave\\" is a song about surfing with a monster riff; \\"Come Back\\" is a shmaltzy tune about a lost love; \\"Gone\\" is reminiscent of the escapism theme heard on \\"In Hiding\\" from the great 1998 CD \\"Yield\\" [[ASIN:B000002BYD Yield]]. Overall, there's less atmospherics and aural adventure on this record than on recent PJ offerings (which I've also loved), and fans might appreciate that.<br /><br />Pearl Jam always end their albums on a poignant, sonically memorable note, and \\"Inside Job,\\" with lyrics and music written by guitarist Mike McCready, is no exception. At six-plus minutes, the song covers a wide range of musical styles and influences. It starts off quiet, foreboding and mysterious, a gentle acoustic guitar paving the way. A piano booms in suddenly, then subsides like the guitar that accompanies it. Vedder's voice leads off haunted but hopeful: \\"I will not lose my faith/it's an inside job today.\\" \\"Inside Job\\" soon picks up steam, with the line \\"How I choose to feel/is how I am.\\" A '70s guitar interlude gives the song even more spice, and by now it's a mid-tempo rocker, as Vedder's voice and the drums also make their presence more noticeable. It's a classic PJ tune that would sound great live.<br /><br />\\"Pearl Jam\\" ends with a lullabylike keyboard, perhaps a loving nod to Vedder's newborn daughter.recent PJ offerings (which I've also loved), and fans might appreciate that.

B000FVQYYK|5.0|If you told me a few months ago that come 2006 Muse would release my favourite album of the year I'd probably find myself a quiet spot and laugh my head off, because, truth be told, prior to \\"Black Holes & Revelations\\" I thoroughly detested Muse. Or more precisely, I thought that I'd rather prefer my eardrums scooped out by a rusty spoon than listen to Matt Bellamy's histrionic singing and those loud asthmatic gasps he makes every five seconds. I had no intention whatsoever of buying their latest but was so impressed with the few snippets of music I've heard at a CD store one day that I decided to give it a go anyway... and fell absolutely in love with the album and its bombastic, demented, over-the-top glory. I've investigated Muse's back catalogue and still think that this is by far their best, most accomplished, consistent, eclectic and enjoyable album. It's enormously gratifying to see a band who actually gets better with every release; how many artists can you name who made a blistering hyped-up debut they never matched ever since?  <br /> <br />The vocals? Well, now that I've been converted I can listen to Matt Bellamy for hours, :) But when I first got the album I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that the vocals were pushed further to the back and Matt's voice matured quite a bit and didn't seem as shrill as I remembered it. Musically, \\"Black Holes & Revelations\\" is an absolute smorgasboard that mixes in progressive rock, classical piano, Queen-like harmonies, flamenco guitar, metal, trumpets, synth-pop, galloping horses and lasers (no, really). The amazing thing is how well all of this gels together to create a true \\"album\\" experience where even relatively weaker songs sound great in the context of the album. \\"Soldier's Poem\\" for instance is not a great standalone song but it works well as a welcome mellow stopover just before things get intense again. <br /> <br />Standouts for me: \\"Starlight\\", probably the poppiest song Muse have ever done. Very simplebut melodic and catchy piano and synths and nice controlled singing from Mr Bellamy. \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\": real surprise - a Muse song that's actually sexy! Great dancey groove and falsetto. \\"Map of the Problematique\\" - stomping synths that recall Depeche Mode. Makes you feel like you're travelling through some space portal. \\"Assassin\\" - the hardest song of the bunch with great agressive drumming. \\"Knights of Cydonia\\" - the album's epic closer and a brilliantly bonkers track which sounds like something Queen would write. I always feel an incredible rush when that final riff kicks in. <br /> <br />If I had to be super-picky, I'd say that although Matt Bellamy may be a guitar wizard and a great vocalist the lyrics aren't really his strongest point. They're not bad as such but to me they seem to be there just so that Matt has something to sing. And after listening to the earlier Muse albums it looks like he ditched the piano somewhat on this record which is a bloody shame. But these are all minor quibbles. Oh, and if you ever have a chance to see Muse live do so - they'll warp your mind.
B000L43AN4|5.0|This was the cherry on top of the bad year dream, the diamond in a pile of bat crap, it rocks, it croons, it weirds you out, it shows, on the third disk that even his oral and comically unscripted moments keep drawing you back to our most beatnik beat generation bad side of the tracks poet laureate of all music. (Of course he's nowhere to be found in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame-If he would have died after his first three albums, he'd be there at this very moment, Joan Baez teary-eyed proclaiming the glories of what we never got to hear after those three albums.  Sniff, Sniff.(edna million in a drop dead suit...)<br /><br />But let us enjoy.  He's at his finest.  The first disk has him rocking out in almost bang-a-gong fashion and with his voice never being more gravely and snarly and right on out of tune, it's probably his best side of the musical tracks he's ever been on.  And it doesn't let up from there.<br /><br />Disk Two is more eclectic and soft, the power of the lyrical genius of this man shoved gently in between the other two disks with a potent barroom quality that has to grow on you a little.  All great things have to grow on you a little-otherwise they wash off too easy and don't leave a scar.<br /><br />You get scarred by the great Mr. Waits and it never fades, it just grows more incandescent each and every listen.<br /><br />I just wish he got out of the house more.  Dammit.  Oh, he'll go to Europe and LA and the Netherlands (Who wouldn't?)<br /><br />When you gonna show up West of East St. Louis (Just about a block?)<br /><br />Come on up to the house, Mr. Waits.

0553278223|4.0|Here is one of the highest examples of the sci-fi genre.  Social commentary on the human race in the form of fiction about made-up beings from another planet.  This is an almost flawless demonstration of the art form.  Dated, but that only makes it more charming.  Bradbury's Martians are superior to men (more sensitive, more warrior-like, more artistic, more philosophical, more cultured, more advanced, more intelligent) while at the same time not possessing any attributes that are not common to men (see the foregoing list).  The synopsis is: humans repeatedly attempt to colonize Mars, only to be initially frustrated by successful defenses by the Martians.  The Martians use telepathic mind games, old-fashioned gunfighting, and plain ol' marital jealousy to delay the inevitable for a few years.  But we keep coming, and we turn the New World into a interplanetary suburb in short order.  Eventually, after we've ruined Mars (like, goes this story line, the white man ruins everything), we answer the call to return to an Earth devasted by the stereotypical total nuclear (or \\"atomic\\") war.  But this synopsis is like summarizing 'Gone With The Wind' as a Civil War book.  Great one, not to be missed.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|This is undoubtedly the best Rock DVD I have ever seen. I was a big Bon Scott fan, and never gave ACDC any airtime after Brian Johnson came onboard - until seeing this DVD. This concert is a gem. It captures Angus at his absolute best, and it captures the spirit of what ACDC is all about. I recommend you get the wife and kids out of the house, get a few mates and a few beers going, hook up the surround sound and crank up the volume. It is a ripsnorter !!
B000J3EEBY|5.0|Over the course of the last few months, I have been completely mesmerized by this album. The instrumentation, the arrangement, the melodies and Oh, that voice!

B0000VD04M|5.0|Tim Burton's homage to Hollywood director, Ed Wood and his crew of movie regulars (irregulars?) is both accurately and poignantly done.  Shot in glorious black and white, \\"Ed Wood\\" is a bio-pic that covers Wood's attempts at cinematic greatness.  In particular, Burton features Wood's movies, \\"Glen or Glenda\\", \\"Bride of the Monster\\", and the best (worse?) of the lot, the infamous \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\".  Each are detailed in painstaking accuracy showing Wood's attempt to get them funded and then filmed.  Much of the film depicts the wonderful friendship that Wood established with the fading film star, Bela Lugosi.  Burton shows Lugosi in a sympathetic way and actor Martin Landeau is flawless in portrayal of one of Hollywood's early horror stars.  (Landeau won an Academy Award for his performance, by the way.)<br /><br />In addition to Johnny Depp's great performance as Wood, other stars make great contributions to the picture.  They include, Bill Murray who's outstanding as Wood's friend, Bunny Breckinridge;  Jeffrey Jones as psychic, Criswell and Sarah Jessica Parker as Wood's girlfriend (and sometimes leading lady), Dolores Fuller.<br /><br />All in all, this is a wonderful film that flows throughout with very few dull spots.  It is heartwarming and uplifting to watch Depp show the undying spirit that Ed Wood had for his films and how his next big break is right around the corner (in his mind, anyway).<br /><br />Because of Wood's cinematic obscurity (or possibly because of his reputation as a director) this film will not appeal to all movie goers. However, if you are a fan of Tim Burton, Johnny Depp or the films of Ed Wood, then this wonderful little gem HAS to become part of your collection.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
0634049011|4.0|Do you associate street signs by what they say or by the shape of the sign? <br /> <br />If shapes find a way of embedding themselves in your mind better than just a bunch of numbers, then this book will be extremely helpful to you. I have purchased countless books on guitar playing. Most of them will teach the things you need to know, but it is all done in TAB. While I can read TAB just fine, my poor mind just can not process the information as fast as simply seeing a shape. This book breaks down root notes into very basic shapes and just starts adding to it. In a few short weeks, you should be able to understand the basic shape of a major scale. After a while you will be able to play the different scales in whatever key you are looking for. <br /> <br />If you know and understand movable chords, then think about taking just five basic shapes and being able to move up and down the fretboard. Again, for me, this was a lot easier to do than to memorize countless pages of guitar TAB to learn just a few scales.  <br /> <br />My one disclaimer would be, and the only reason I give this 4 stars rather than 5 - I would recommend having at least a small amount of musical knowledge before getting started. Get to know your guitar and learn a few chord shapes and songs. This will give you something to fall back on and still enjoy, should you get frustrated when you just can't figure out what the relative minor scale is to the D major scale.
0618680004|5.0|Let me be totally politically incorrect in saying what Dawkins and others have said/implied...the more intelligent/educated/logical thinker you are, the higher the chances you are an atheist.  Intelligent people analyze information and come to a conclusion based on logical facts.  Scientists often look at another's research and change their beliefs.  What was taken as fact in the past (the earth is the center of the universe for example) has been disproven and higher thinking people have accepted the changes into their philosophy.  Can anyone believe that the fundamenist Christian would look at Islam, Hinduism, Taoism, Judaism etc. and find that their own values need an adjustment??
0743455967|5.0|He tells stories of him growing up, writes in a way that makes you feel like he is talking to you.  His experience before the world knew of him and what he knows now.  Stephen King writes this book with truth.  King surprise me in Second Forward. About how most books on writing is filled with bull....  If you are looking for more, he tells us where to look (books).  He talks about the use of basic sentences, grammar. He gives advice on all of this.  He gives examples on how a sentence is written and then writes it the way he would. He gives examples on how you can write a sentence in a way that is interesting and strong. This is one way I find that can  keep the reader interested.  He does this with a few sentences. When giving advice, some people want it repeated in  a different way. This book gives a lot of examples.  When he tells his stories, he also says what he expected with the stuff he wrote.  He speaks on he-said/she-said in dialogue attribution and points to a book to read. I guess many of the things he left out are told in the books he suggested to read.  If you are experience. You will still find this book interesting because it is written in a way a story is written.  Not like a textbook is written.  Step into the mind of King, and know the secret of how he keeps his readers interested.  One example is; He closed the door firmly.  It can be written like this; He closed the door.  He goes on to say that the actions he made before he closed the door can already have express the way the door was closed.   This book is very much filled with advice, experience and truth.  Timid writer is a bad writer!  Update:  Shorten review/ thinking about reading book again:)
074356619X|2.0|The Secret starts well enough by asking the reader to focus on what he/she really wants.  Becoming very clear on exactly what you want and even going to the extent of visualizing having that desire.  However, where The Secret goes from there is only to reinforce our desire to get something for next to nothing.  That promise is what sells books. <br /> <br />The idea that you only need to be clear on what you want and that the universe will bring it into being, is only half correct.  Knowing what you want is absolutely critical to actually getting what you want.  However, the step following the knowing is not the waiting for its appearance.  The step following the knowing is taking the actions necessary to put yourself in the best position to get what you want.  It is this concept that the book completely ignores.   <br /> <br />Really wanting a Ferrari and doing nothing but sitting in your room with your legs crossed focusing only on wanting that Ferrari, is certainly not going to yield a Ferrari sitting in your driveway.  However, knowing that is what you want and taking actions to better align your finances, education, contacts, etc., is what can really make that Ferrari dream come true. <br /> <br />Certainly it sells to suggest that doing little will yield your greatest desires.  Pop a pill and lose weight regardless of eating, exercise, or genetics.  Dream about what you want and wait for the benevolent universe to come down the chimney like Santa Clause to deliver your desires.  Wonderful ideas to be sure, just not ones that will actually get you what you want.   <br /> <br />The real secret is truly knowing what you want.  For those that do, taking the actions necessary to make your desires real, become part of your daily life.  From there, you might just get what you are after.  Taking The Secret for what it suggests will likely only yield you purchasing a different book on the same subject and different book after that.  Desires will then truly be fulfilled...for the authors. <br />

B00009W0U4|2.0|This is by far the most pretentious piece of French crap I have seen in years. What bothers me are not the admittedly disturbing scenes, but rather the banality of the film's underlying idea, which the director, Gaspar Noe, attempted to convey in a thoroughly unremarkable fashion. The characters are not shown in any depth; in fact, there is no meaningful dialogue or any other attempt at all to introduce them to the viewer. Camera work is simply awful - somebody should have explained to the cameraman that rotating a hand-held camera at will for minutes at a time does not always produce art. Apparently, these sterile methods combined with shocking scenes of rape and murder are supposed to produce a new form of cin&eacute;ma v&eacute;rit&eacute;.<br /><br />In short, even though in France almost every baker is an \\"artiste\\" (think \\"baguette artisanale\\"), Mr. Noe is not a \\"cin&eacute;aste\\" even by French standards: hit someone in the face with a teakettle and call it art!

0374105235|5.0|Twelve year old Ishmael Beah was visiting a neighboring town for a talent show with his friends when his village was destroyed by violence.  There may have been a reason for the original conflict in Sierra Leone, but by the time this author was orphaned, both sides were conscripting children and were equally guilty of atrocities.   They provided drugs, propaganda, and arms to these boys and turned them loose against each other in a world of constant guerilla warfare and death.   Beah escaped this living Hell with the help of UNICEF at age 15 only to almost be drawn into it again at 17.  Instead, he managed to escape to the US where he attended and graduated from Oberlin College. <br /> <br />This book will make you lose hope for the human race - in its tendency to relentlessly degenerate into genocide.  Then it gives you hope - since a boy like Ishmael can be salvaged, not only relatively unscathed, but to emerge as a spokesman for a better brand of humanity.  His story  literally blew me away.  <br /> <br />

I recommend this book for the 3-4 year old range since you have to be careful with turning the pages.  It is a good book for practicing colors, too.

B00005LB50|3.0|I'm a rabid Buffalo Springfield fan and have covered their music in a number of bands.  I remember listening to Stereo X FM Underground while growing up in SoCal in the 60's and from time to time they would play the 11-minute version of Bluebird.  The 9-minute version exists on the 1971 compilation vinyl (I have it), but unfortunately the full 11-minute version wasn't included on this boxed set.  I spoke with Stills a few years ago at Summer NAMM in Nashville and he told me the master tape containing the 11-minute version still exists  but that he didn't want it on the boxed set because the final jam falls apart.  Still for those of us who are major fans of the Buffalo Springfield, this would not have mattered.  What we want is special historical music insights and golden moments, and the 11-minute version would have gone a long way to making a so-so boxed set into a far better collector's treasure.
B000ICM5IK|5.0|This CD is fantastic!

0307237702|1.0|other than to convey my shock. The first thing I want to bring up is that Barack Obama says that he is the arbiter of all things. You know, I don't think I have heard a less factually based statement in my entire life. Only through education can individuals gain the independent tools they need to rage, rage against the dying of the light. But the first step is to acknowledge that I can undeniably suggest how Barack ought to behave. Ultimately, however, the burden of acting with moral rectitude lies with Barack himself.<br /><br />One wonders if Barack has the cheek to open new avenues for the expression of hate. I undoubtedly hope not because I know some uninformed, headstrong pseudo-intellectuals who contend they once overheard him say, \\"I want to hinder economic growth and job creation faster than you can say 'photodisintegration'\\". Do I blame society for this? No, I blame Barack. I want my life to count. I want to be part of something significant and lasting. I want to fight scurrility and slander.<br /><br />What I have been writing up to this point is not what I initially intended to write. Instead, I decided it would be far more productive to tell you that Barack's arguments would be a lot more effective if they were at least accurate or intelligent, not just a load of bull for the sake of being controversial. Does Barack have trouble living with himself, knowing that we must be fearless in confronting his homicidal, delusional gang? The complete answer to that question is a long, sad story. I've answered parts of that question in several of my previous debates, and I'll answer other parts in future ones. For now, I'll just say that all he really wants is to hang onto the perks he's getting from the system. That's all he really cares about. That's the end of this review. If I was unable to convince you that Barack Obama has no standards of decency, then you should definitely consider contacting me with your supporting or refuting evidence, opinions, personal stories, etc., so that I can make a better argument in my next review.tories, etc., so that I can make a better argument in my next review.

I recommend buying their full albums, but if you don't know much about them, then get this album. Great compilation, a must have. <br /> <br />\\"Where is My Mind?\\" BEST. SONG. EVER. But that's just my opinion, see for yourself. When I heard this song playing at the end credits of the movie \\"Fight Club\\", I nearly juped outta my seat. It's an awesome song and perfect for that ending.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|I've been reading Ian Fleming's James Bond stories since my teen years (we won't discuss the offerings of subsequent authors), and I've repeatedly seen all of the movies, most of which mangle the Fleming books to a greater or less degree. That's unfortunate, for the real genius of Bond lies in Fleming's stories, and now the filmmakers at last seems to have realized that. In my experience, NOTHING the studios have ever done until now comes close to capturing the spirit of Fleming's Bond. Casino Royale does. (Ironic, since the novel on which it's based isn't one of Fleming's strongest.) <br /> <br />This movie strips away decades of celluloid layers of convoluted plots, stylized humor, overblown and even stupidly-conceived villains, and fetishistic devotion to gadgetry, and at last returns to the basics: A fast-paced plot that follows Fleming's original novel pretty closely, and Daniel Craig's portrayal of a Bond exactly as Fleming wrote him. This is a Bond who is, at one level, passionate for life and somewhat reckless, while simultaneously (and paradoxically) cold, calculating, and professional. Fleming's narrative style allowed us to listen in on Bond's thoughts, giving us a three-dimensional character (despite Blofeld's description of him in the book You Only Live Twice), and for the first time ever in the films, Craig manages to portray that complexity. He's totally unforced. Dalton and Bosnan give us glimmers, selected dimensions, of the true Bond (Dalton's darkness, Brosnan's \\"I never grew up\\"), but Craig nails it. He IS James Bond. There is, somewhat regrettably, still more than a touch of the \\"rogue agent\\" element here that's a creature of the films rather than the books, but this time, unlike the other films, it doesn't come across as quirky but instead underscores how ruthless and dangerous Bond really is. A \\"decent\\" person doesn't break into a lady's home, especially when the lady in question is his boss. A \\"decent\\" man doesn't make a practice of bedding astring of married women, but Fleming's Bond does, and so, pointedly, does Craig. He has just the right amount of understated humor (as opposed to silliness a la Roger Moore et al.) as well, also typical of Fleming's Bond. In short, he takes the role seriously and plays it just as Fleming wrote it, and the producer, director, and writer all let him, much to their credit. <br /> <br />As to the rest, it largely measures up to Craig. Judi Dench is the best M ever, just as dangerous and ruthless in her own way as Bond is, highly faithful to Fleming's M despite the sex change. Mads Mikkelsen is an excellent Le Chiffre, very human as opposed to the years of set-piece supervillians we got from the films from the '60's until the early '80s. (When he begins to lose his temper while torturing Bond, it's perhaps the most humanizing moment for any cinema Bond villain. It's nice to have a villain show some emotion for a change instead of sitting around in a zany Stalinesque uniform oozing affectation and plotting world destruction, although that stereotype does admittedly trace its roots to the Fleming books.) Eva Green is closely faithful to Fleming's Vesper and even looks like her.  The film downplays Felix Leiter and does get Rene Mathis wrong--in the books Mathis is Bond's old and unquestionably loyal friend--but compared to the stellar job the producer does with the rest of the film, these are minor qualms. The score is lush and understated, and the theme song may possibly be the best one ever: edgy, high-energy, with lyrics that evoke a combination of danger, recklessness, and cynicism, PERFECTLY reflecting Bond's character. It works seamlessly with what is also the best opening sequence ever in the Bond film series. <br /> <br />By now you get the idea. This film deserves nothing but superlatives and has set a very high bar for the next outing. To paraphrase a review of one of Fleming's books, the movie is escapism, of course, but what escapism! This one's a keeper.
B000M5B6Q0|4.0|Ok, they do a great job recreating the 80s pop style with Hugh Grant giving it his best send up of George Michael/Flock of Seagulls/etc.  The real star is \\"Cora,\\" who perfectly creates with considerable talent, flair and poise a Pop Princess who can actually sing!<br /><br />Over the top at times and strictly for fans of the film, but fun and well produced.
B00005JOCU|3.0|I have never looked so forward to seeing a film as I have eagerly awaited Dreamgirls.  I saw the play on Broadway in the 1980's, and was completely blown away by the production and all of the performances.  I had never seen anything like it and haven't since.  While the new film version is fun and entertaining, it has none of the grit the stage production had, which left you dazzled but also feeling punched in the gut.      The Deena character has been changed fairly drasticly.  In the play she was a clever force to be dealt with, not the sweet, naive victim she is portrayed to be in the film.  Jennifer Hudson is terrific and deserves all of the awards and attention she is getting.  But even still, Jennifer Holliday's performance is one I will never, ever forget.  I have listened to her on the original cast recording probably hundreds of times, and every single time it's as though I am hearing it for the first time.  I am endlessly amazed by her performance.  I don't think I'll be able to say that about Miss Hudson's performance 20 years from now.  Eddie Murphy, was for me, the stand out performance in the film.  He owns that part.    The movie is definately worth seeing, particularly if you did not see the play, and especially the play with the original cast.  But if you did see the original stage cast and production - don't expect the same kind of experience.  You won't remember this movie for long.

Highly recommended.

B0009A1AS2|4.0|I have several DT albums, and of course bought this one as soon as it came out.  I realized I had not listened to this album as much as, say, Images and Words or Metropolis Part 2.  That's not to say I didn't pop it in to listen to the title track, but I didn't seem to give the other songs a chance.  I resolved to change that and boy, am I glad I did.   <br /> <br />The album is full of solid songs, and the band is not afraid to lay it all out there and be vulnerable.  It is clear the band did what they wanted to, and that includes borrowing heavily from other bands' sound.  The result works.   <br /> <br />The only real objection I have to the album is that many of the songs sound somewhat similar--that is to say, there isn't a lot of variety in textures and tempos.  However, when that sound is as solid as it is, this does not detract greatly from the listening experience.   <br /> <br />Not their magnum opus (which I hold to be Metropolis Part 2, which shan't be superseded), but certainly a very strong effort that will find a welcome home in any prog-metal fan's collection.

B000002L7Y|5.0|I bought the Trilogy of this, Scoundrel Days, and Stay On These Roads. So far I've only listened to Hunting High and Low and Scoundrel Days, and I'm very impressed!  <br />I bought them because, as an artist, when I saw the music video for 'Take On Me', I just couldn't help but wanting to know more about this amazing band. This CD gave me exactly what I wanted: more fantastic music from a very talented trio!  <br />The songs are very inspiring and sometimes a little sad, like the title track (which sounds a lot different than it does remixed on Headlines and Deadlines... I like that version better than the one on this. Oh well!) and 'Living a Boy's Adventure Tale', full of things that really make you think about life and what's surrounding you. The music in general, Magne and Pal's songwriting and instrumental skills, brings you out of this world! But then again, I do have a strong love for synthesizers and keyboards. Not to mention the angelic vocal talents of Morten! WOW! He could sing opera if he wanted to; he's that good. <br /> <br />Some great tracks besides the hits/singles: The Blue Sky, Living a Boy's Adventure Tale, Here I Stand and Face the Rain.  <br /> <br />I'd definitely recommend this to anyone that wants to feel inspired and witness one of the greatest (and underappreciated) bands in history, and also to fellow artists and anyone who loves great synth music. Even 22 years later...
B000069KE0|5.0|When I was in college in the early 70's this and their first album were all the rage.  It seemed that every dance you went to played \\"Colour My World\\" as the slow number.  I actually got sick of it but have never tired of most of the other tunes, especially \\"25 or 6 to 4\\".    I'm listening to the 2002 remastered CD and have to agree with one of the previous reviewers that the sound does seem a little \\"compressed\\" or mid-range only and I too always thought that about the vinyl LPs.  But, it's still great to listen to and well worth it.  Stereo separation is great and tape hiss is not too bad except I did notice it at the beginning of track 19.  Some of this is very daring and experimental.  Just listen to the 2nd movement of \\"It Better End Soon\\" (Track 20) - WOW!!  It's clearly one of their top 3 albums.  I prefer the album versions but it's great to have the single versions of \\"Make Me Smile\\" and \\"25 or 6 to 4\\".  Total time of the CD is over 73 minutes.    By the way I saw this band recently and they were great!!  So go see them if you can.  Robert Lamm and the brass section are still first rate.  I also have to compliment the new guitar player - can't remember his name (seemed 30 years younger than rest of the band!) but he did an incredible job on \\"25 or 6 to 4\\".  It rocked like I have NEVER heard it before - thanks for keeping it a guitar-dominated song.    The \\"It Better End Soon\\" Suite is much better than I remember it.  And, unfortunately, it's as relevant today as it was in 1970.

B000KX0IOK|4.0|First of all, Half Nelson is everything an independent film should be. There's no cut-and-dry plot with a good guy vs. bad guy, beginning, middle, end, etc. What Half Nelson offers is a cinematic slice of realistic life. The realistic life the script is most concerned with is Dan Dunne, a junior high teacher in Brooklyn with a little bit of a drug problem.<br /><br />Ryan Gosling excellently portrays the troubled teacher and earns his Oscar nomination without a doubt. Dan Dunne wants to change the world. He wants to help people. But more and more he's realizing that he is just one man, and the world is weighing heavily on his shoulders. That's where the drug use comes in. And the trips to bars looking for conversation partners just leave him more depressed.<br /><br />The other central character in the film is a young girl named Drey in one of Dan's classes, played by Shareeka Epps. Epps brings enough to her character to carry her scenes and even keep up with Gosling in all their scenes together. (She earned a Best Young Actress nomination but Abigail Breslin from Little Miss Sunshine won).<br /><br />Overall, the film addresses a lot of important issues: drug addiction, loneliness, self-reliance, and dialectics (the tension between two opposing forces). There are several intercut scenes of students giving reports on important dates in the history of the United States, mostly Civil Rights movement events. These are used to demonstrate that enough people can make a difference.<br /><br />Ultimately, Dunne understands that he can't help everyone in the world, but he can help one person, namely Drey. What keeps the movie from being another \\"Dangerous Minds\\"-esque film is Dunne's own inner turmoil, and the opposing character played by Anthony Mackie, who is also trying to \\"help\\" Drey by getting her to deal drugs with him. He's not portrayed as a bad guy, just a guy doing what he knows how to do.<br /><br />The realism in the construction of this script and filmwork is what really sets this film apart, and Ryan Gosling's acting just seals the deal. If you want to see a best actor nominee from this year that is really in a good movie, check out Half Nelson.ilmwork is what really sets this film apart, and Ryan Gosling's acting just seals the deal.

Similar to Human Genome leader Collin's belief, the book on \\"Science, Religion & Spirituality\\" believe that Science and God can co-exist. This is one book that presents reconciliation between science and god/religion. A rare blend that brings science and spirituality together which are generally treated as oil and water. This is also a book that looks on Science, religion and spirituality from Eastern and Western point of view.    Truth cannot contradict itself. Truth from science and truth from God/Religion must eventually converge into one grand whole, a unified knowledge of the laws that govern our universe. Those who fight over superiority of one over the other are blinded by ignorance about both.     [...]

6305252521|5.0|The 1998 film The Truman Show (directed by Peter Weir) narrates the life of Truman Banks (Jim Carrey), who is unaware that his entire life on the island of Seahaven is completely constructed by a TV crew, and is part of a constantly running reality television program called The Truman Show, watched by millions 24/7 world-wide.  But when Truman comes to realize that something is strange about his world, he makes plans to escape his artificially manipulated universe.<br /><br />The premise is a clever one, and the film succeeds on the level of story alone.  But what's particularly of interest to this reviewer are the profound philosophical and religious questions that the movie seems to ask.  Not only does it raises age-old philosophical questions common in the field of epistemology, concerning what we can know about reality (e.g. could I be deceived about what my senses and experiences are telling me about reality?), but it also appears to explore many deep religious questions by means of allusions to Christian themes.  Consider how the TV producer Christof (= Christ of) is the \\"creator\\" of Truman (= True Man), and functions as a god who controls his world.  The symbolism seems too strong to ignore, and as a result, particularly in Christian circles where this imagery cannot go unnoticed, there is considerable debate about the worldview behind the film, and whether it is intended to portray an atheistic or Christian worldview.  Reviewers typically fall into one of two camps:<br /><br />a) those who see it as a secular film, by portraying the Christian God as a cruel and harsh dictator who operates a deterministic universe from which we need to escape by rejecting God.  According to this view, Truman's liberation is a depiction of the Fall, and promotes an atheistic lifestyle of rebellion against the Creator and an escape from Eden.  Others have tried to be more charitable by interpreting it in line with Calvinistic theology, suggesting that the film depicts the tragedy rather than the triumph of sin, but this is implausible in view of how the Creator is portrayed negatively and how the final liberation is presented so positively.<br /><br />b) those who see it as a criticism of secularism, by suggesting that Satan creates an artificial world for us, from which we need to escape by converting to the truth.  According to this view, Truman's liberation promotes the need to escape the deception of Satan (the anti-Christ), and exchange it for a life lived in service to the true God.  Some have even seen it as giving a positive message about Christianity, for if Seahaven represents an illusionary man-made Paradise, then Truman's decision to leave this old world behind is symbolic of a conversion experience, and he represents a Christ-like figure who models the way of salvation.<br /><br />The first view interprets The Truman Show as a story of the Fall, where Christoff symbolizes the true God, and Sylvia (who encourages Truman to escape his \\"world\\") is a serpent-tempter figure that brings rebellion.  The second view interprets The Truman Show as a story of Redemption, where Christoff symbolizes an anti-Christ, and Sylvia is an intercessor that brings freedom in contrast to the Judas figure Marlon.  Proponents of both views have engaged in considerable debate over these two interpretations, the former which sees the Truman Show as a secular existentialist film, the latter which sees it as a pro-Christian film.<br /><br />Certainly the rich symbolism in the film lends itself to an interpretation which gives the Christological imagery throughout the film a more important meaning than mere allusion.  But neither of the above explanations is entirely satisfactory or consistent.  Because how can Truman be a rebel who rejects God, and at the same time a Christ-like figure (he is depicted as crucified in the boat, and at the end walks on water and ascends into a stairway of heaven)?  And how can Christoff be representative of a deterministiccreator, and at the same time an anti-Christ?  A consistent allegorical interpretation fails in its application, and should already be a hint that one is not intended.<br /><br />Perhaps the best solution is one which is neither overly critical nor overly charitable with respect to the Biblical imagery, but sees this as subordinate to other themes about the media and television, without forcing a simplistic choice demanded by a polarized approach.  Director Peter Weir has gone on record in more than one interview that the film is about television.  Weir is of this conviction: \\"My attitude to television, personally, is too much of it is a bad thing.\\"  According to Weir: \\"And that's really at the heart of what the film looks at in a major way - this disturbance to our perception of reality, as a result of the immense entertainment and actuality coming at us, to the point where you can't differentiate anymore. News programs that are entertaining; video everywhere.\\" Given Weir's remarks, I believe that the Truman Show is essentially a sharp criticism of the dangers of a false reality cultivated by the media, and a warning against losing our sense of reality.<br /><br />Clearly Weir has chosen to portray the director Christoff as a creator figure very deliberately, but he does not use this image to push a religious agenda, but to give a social commentary about problems created by the modern media, which blurs the lines between appearance and reality.  In that regard, his analysis of television is spot on and speaks to our time: to what extent is our perception of the world the result of manipulation by the media?  And do we need to be liberated from the artificial reality of a TV world and return to the real world?  I see this explanation (advocated also by Andrew H. Trotter) as more plausible than one which sees the film as a simple spiritual allegory, or which interprets it as an indictment on reality television (note that the release of the movie predates much of the contemporary fascination with reality TV shows).<br /><br />In short, the Truman Show is defending neither an atheist or a Christian worldview, but it merely employs Biblical themes and allusions as servants to its real theme and social commentary about the media and television. It has to be conceded that both Christoff's and Truman's characters have clear Christological symbolism, but the film is ambiguous about which of the two is to be identified as the Christ figure simply because it doesn't want us making a choice between them.  Although the religious symbolism is too strong to ignore, in the end it is subordinate to the more central theme about the role of television and media in our culture, and is a means to an end rather than an end in itself.  Consequently in my view, it's a mistake to see the film either as an attack on Christianity, or as a tool for evangelism.  That's not to say that the film doesn't raise interesting parallels on a religious levels - certainly it can stimulate interesting discussion both about how God the Creator watches over us (cf. Psalm 139), as well as how the Satan the father of lies deceives us.  Ironically, the Truman Show has created its own deception - while appearances suggest it is a spiritual allegory, a closer look suggests that this perception is merely an illusion. - GODLY GADFLYcreator, and at the same time an anti-Christ?

I am not a makeup artists, I just like to be reminded that I can do whatever I want with my own face and Kevin's books help me regain my confidence about what beauty is.....it is not about the makeup, it is about who a person is, and what shines through.  His application tips have changed the way I make my face.  Over the years I rarely have worn makeup because I don't like looking like I am wearing makeup, following Kevin's suggestions and techniques has allowed me to develop the skill to enhance myself in a way that is not glaringly obvious, but a a before and after comparison would yield a tremendous difference.  I am grateful for stumbling into finding Kevin's books and now I LOVE wearing my makeup.  Putting it on and taking it off has become a small enjoyable ritual for me in a hectic pace of life.
0767824571|2.0|The English comedy group Monty Python (Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin), is widely known for its series of humorous sketch shows, broadcast on television in the early 1970s. Much of their work was a humorous combination of the creative, farcical, and surreal, such that the group's influence on subsequent comedy was significant. In \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\", they tried their hand at a feature length film that spoofed the Arthurian legends and the quest for the holy grail, with a parody of the chivalrous knights of medieval tales. Being a fan of the Arthurian legends and of parody, it was this combination that first attracted me to this film, as well as the fact that it is often regarded as one of the greatest comedy films of all time.<br /><br />But does Monty Python & the Holy Grail live up to this reputation?  The influence and popularity of Monty Python is indisputable, but that does not mean that this comedy troupe has found favour from all quarters. Certainly they display the potential to come up with some extraordinarily creative and original humor, appreciated especially by those who find the surreal and absurd in any way funny.  But it is regrettable that the humor of their television shows often descends into the risque and irreverent.  Monty Python and the Holy Grail is no different in that it contains both the usual brand of Python humor, as well as a significant amount of irreverence and sexual innuendo. Some parts are funny, in fact tremendously so, for who can ever forget the defeat of the killer rabbit with Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, the three-headed Knights that say \\"Ni--!\\", the Bridge of Death with its absurd riddles, and the closing scenes where our heroic knights are conquer the grail, only to be arrested by British policemen.  But the clever humor doesn't excuse the large amounts of blasphemous material, which frequently is used as a source of humor in connection with the religious aspects of the grail. Monty Python took their irreverence even a step further in a subsequent film, Life of Brian, which is a parody of the Biblical Messiah Jesus Christ. But it's not just unholy religious humor that's problematic here - discerning viewers should realize that \\"the Holy Grail\\" also contains some risque sexual innuendo in the usual Monty Python style.  And these moral concerns aside, there are cases in \\"the Holy Grail\\" where the surreal attempts at humor just aren't funny, but stupid.<br /><br />Critiquing a sacred cow is always dangerous, not least when this films is regarded one of comedy's holy grails.  But those of us who err on the side of conservatism with our moral standards will want to give this film a miss. For a more innocent parody of chivalry which avoids the unholiness and irreverence of this humor, try instead Goldman's The Princess Bride. - GODLY GADFLYspects of the grail.

B000002UAU|5.0|Sgt. Pepper's is the most influential album of all time and it changed pop music forever. We owe all pop music we have today to the Beatles. Actually, the two previous albums, Rubber Soul and Revolver, are considered the ones that started changing pop music and Sgt Pepper is regarded as the milestone of that change in music. Sgt Pepper's remains the most celebrated album but it was not close to perfection because it included some weak songs and left off a couple of masterpieces that were written originally for this album, namely John's masterpiece and actually The Beatles' best song in their career, Strawberry Fields Forever, and Paul's best song ever, Penny Lane.<br /><br />The 1st  track, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, is a great song by Paul, and it really works as an overture or a preface that makes us think \\"here comes a great album\\".<br /><br />The 2nd track, With A Little Help From My Friends, Paul's idea with a little help from John, sounds like the beginning of the story, as if it was trying to tell us what this album's story is about, smooth, easy, trippy, psychedelic and beautiful.<br /><br />The 3rd track, Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds, is John's first sign, like in the Gospel of John, a sign to let us know that this great song is just one of the 7 miracles that are about to be performed.<br /><br />The 4th track, Getting Better, another Paul's idea with more help from John, is just a good song.<br /><br />The 5th track, Fixing A Hole, is just another good song by Paul, and even John praised its lyrics.<br /><br />The 6th track, She's Leaving Home, is a very weak song, one of those usually lazy and boring songs by Paul. It was not even good enough to be the B side of a single; it is has nothing to do with the Beatles; it was just suitable for one of those poor solo albums by Paul, but unfortunately it was included in this great album.<br /><br />The 7th track, Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite, is a great song by John with a little help from Paul and it wakes us up and turns us on again as we were all taking a snap while She's Leaving Home was playing.<br /><br />The 8th track, Within You Without You, is a great song by George, and this is the one that really gives a different perspective to the album. It is the soul and the spirit of the album, almost a miracle.<br /><br />The 9th track, When I'm Sixty-Four, is another weak and boring song by Paul. And he would continue haunting us with those types of songs in the following Beatles albums (Honey Pie, Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da, Your Mother Should Know, etc).<br /><br />The 10th track, Lovely Rita, is a great pop song by Paul and here Paul redeems himself and wake us up after making us take another snap with When I'm Sixty-Four.<br /><br />The 11th track, Good Morning Good Morning, is again just another good song by John. But here it sounds a little bit like a filler. Even John regarded it as a piece of garbage. Why fill the album with just good songs when you have a couple of masterpieces available?<br /><br />The 12th track, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise), by Paul is another filler but here it works better. It belongs to Sgt Pepper just as the 1st track does.<br /><br />The 13th track, A Day In The Life, is John's second and last sign.<br /><br />The other 5 signs or miracles never came to be. If the 5th Beatle, George Martin, had at least replaced Paul's two boring and weak songs (She's Leaving Home and When I'm Sixty-Four) with Strawberry Fields Forever and Penny Lane, we would have an album closer to perfection, with 4 miracles and 9 good tricks. Paul would still be responsible for the majority of the songs (7) as he liked to play the boss, and John's 5 songs would still continue to be the best contributions to the album.<br /><br />But The Beatles were so good and so great that they could allow themselves the luxury of releasing an album with B sides and fillers in the place of masterpieces and still make a lot of difference and change muiscfor better and for good.<br /><br />If you take all their singles just prior to and just after Sgt. Pepper's and put them together you come up with another masterpiece, namely:<br /><br />1. Paperback Writer<br />2. Rain<br />3. Penny Lane<br />4. Strawberry Fields Forever<br />5. All You Need Is Love<br />6. Baby You're A Rich Man<br />7. Hello Goodbye<br />8. I Am The Walrus<br />9. Lady Madonna<br />10.Hey Jude<br /><br />This set of ten songs put together as an album and having the 4th track as its title is even better than the real thing.

B000M341QE|2.0|I Like Martin Scorcese as well as anyone, but The Departed is far from his best.  This movie had the potential to be really promising, a great premise, an awesome cast, and a fantastic director, but none of it lived up to it's potential.  Please be warned, though, I can't talk about why this movie is as bad as it is without talking about it's end.  I won't tell you exactly how it ends, but some people may feel the way I describe the ending as a spoiler, so if you don't want to risk reading that, don't go any further.    The premise is that two kids grow up in Boston and go to the Police Academy.  One of them, Colin Sullivan, played by Matt Damon is befriended at a young age by arch mobster Frank Costello, played Jack Nicholson.  He ends up as Costello's mole in the Police Department, eventually being assigned to the Special Investigation Unit whose main goal is to bring Frank Costello down.  The other kid, William Costigan, played by Leonardo DiCaprio is pulled out of the Police Academy and sent to jail with the purpose of going deep undercover to eventually get close to Costello and gather enough information to bust him.  So Costello's mob and the police both have a mole in each other's operation and, in a way, it becomes both mole's jobs to find themselves or each other, or something like that.    Great premise, but except for the very interesting and perhaps even ground breaking use of cell phones in making a thriller, the execution was sadly lacking.  Yes, the first part of the movie covers a lot of ground, and it has to.  But it was still more confusing than it needed to be.  While I enjoyed Decaprio and Damon's performance's, except for the South Boston accents that faded in and out depending on how hard they were concentrating, Nicholson's performance was just too extreme.  Someone seriously needed to slap him and remind him that he wasn't playing the Joker in Batman anymore.  The rest of the cast was pretty good though.    Even the soundtrack in this movie was annoying, weird Spanish music when the Joker, er, Jack, er Frank Costello came on screen, and a cover band's version of Pink Floyd's \\"Comfortably Numb.\\"  I don't understand that at all, if you can't get the rights to the original, don't put it in the movie, find something else.  Don't hire a cover band to do the song, at least not a song that well known.  And the Spanish music that came on for the entire first half of the movie whenever Nicholson was on screen.  What's up with that?  I also thought this was an Irish mob, isn't Costello an Italian name, or is the music implying he's Spanish, maybe with a hint of Creole.  Who knows?    As bad as this movie was, it was still watchable, until the ending.  This has to be the worst ending of any movie I've ever seen.  The envelope Costigan leaves with the police psychiatrist is never mentioned.  A lawyer you've never heard about supposedly appears from nowhere and hands Costigan a bunch of tapes Costello made incriminating Sullivan.  Another mob mole on the Police Department that you never saw before shows up out of the blue and kills one of the main characters you've just spent the last two hours sympathizing with.  And finally a last mobster kills off another main character, who, get this, really wants to die.  It's almost as if they got to the 2 hour and 15 minutes mark and decided, oops, we got 15 minutes to tie up this film, let's just kill everyone.  It's ridiculous, and totally pointless.  I was enjoying the movie for the most part until the end.  After the ending, I really wished I hadn't wasted my time.

What scientific experiment did you do which proves that there is no God?! <br /> <br />It is logically impossible to prove a negative. Thus, science is diametrically opposed to the irrational BELIEF that there is no God. REAL science never rules out what is possible, such as the existence of God or uncatalogued cryptids or or anything else. <br /> <br />Yup, this review will generate lots of negative responses because the only people who will look at this or any other book of its ilk are those who are governed by their delusional BELIEF that there is no God. There is no way to reason with someone like that. To contradict them will only elicit an angry response and name-calling. Mind you, they will offer no rational argument or proof that their BELIEF is valid. They will remain entrenched in their irrational, delusional BELIEF system.

B0006GANN2|5.0|Most reviews here have just about covered the cinematic significance of this classic. <br />In my opinion, it's Hackman's best work - and that's sayin' something, when you consider his stellar career. <br /> <br />It's also refreshingly politically INcorrcect. It reminds me so much of my childhood in Highland Park, MI, during the Detroit Riots of 1967: Dirty neighborhoods, patroled by anal, head-knocking cops. In that sense, Hackman does an excellent portrayal. <br /> <br />The film has been, and is in my top five, all-time.
0060090367|4.0|This was my first Marian Keyes book and certainly won't be my last! I picked it up at a friend's house to avoid dying of boredom during a basketball game and was quickly absorbed and giggling. I love Keyes' wry wit and easy to read language.  <br /> <br />I rate the first half of the book 5 out of 5 stars, but the second half is not as good and does drag on a little. I definitely laughed more during the first half. The end is fairly predictable but perfect for this kind of book.  <br /> <br />All in all, a fun, entertaining book that I would recommend.

B000059T1E|5.0|this is one of my favorite rock and roll (plus jazz and folk influenced) albums of all time.  <br />it gets my vote as Traffic's best, but that's a tough call, for sure. what an amazing mix of <br />songs, styles, influences in a unique blend of music. never get tired of hearing the story <br />of poor John Barleycorn!
006112429X|1.0|Thinking that this would be an interesting study of a disturbed child I bought this book.  Not only was it horrendously boring (first part) with endless descriptions of nothing of interest, I found the story implausible, overinflated and just plain disgusting.  The reader is very manipulated into feeling terrified for Celia the only truly tender character.  Why would seemingly intelligent people that were doing everything in the world for their child think it was okay, or at least accept, for that child to wear diapers at age 6?  The incident with the cast and Kevin \\"covering\\" for his mother was ridiculous.  I don't believe for a minute a child that age would be mature enough not to scream to his father and to everyone else exactly what happened.  Awful book.  I felt assaulted when I finished it and had to skip through some parts.  Just toooo boring and ridiculous.
B000IU3XU6|3.0|This cd is not as good as the first two albums, \\"Josh Groban\\" and \\"Closer\\". Those two were fantastic-5 star albums. \\"Awake\\" is disappointing. First, Josh should stick to ballads, in English and Italian. On \\"Awake\\", he sings in the current pop/rock style of Clay Aiken, and it does not suit him. The Italian songs are ok, but all of the songs in English are poorly written; forgettable music and bad lyrics. And no outstanding songs, such as \\"Let Me Fall\\" and \\"You Raise Me Up\\" from the first two albums. Josh still sounds wonderful-he has a magnificent voice. But the material in this album fails him. Why was \\"A Time for Us\\" not sung in English? It would have been much more moving and effective if it had been. Josh should rethink his next album, and return to what he does best. And, a gripe to his producers. The basic album is priced at $13.99. But two songs are not included. To get those two songs, you have to buy the special edition, priced at $22.99. And what do you get for the extra nine dollars? The two songs and a lousy 33 minute dvd about the making of the album. What a gyp. It shows the low opinion that the producers have of his fans: just a bunch of sheep from which to make money. The squeeze play. I really do love Josh Groban. But this album is disappointing and I really am unhappy about it.
B000KP62MA|5.0|Saw a video from this album last month on LOGO tv and really liked it.  It was a Valentine's Day gift for 2007 and I liked all of the songs equally which is rather rare on many albums these days.  If you like gothic/metal music then this might be for you.
0441008615|5.0|This is a review of Good Omens. Well, sort of a review. I told a friend of this book (well, I told many but this narrative has to do with one in particular). Told him it was the funniest book I'd ever read. \\"I've never a read a book yet that made me really laugh,\\" he tells me. Ok, fine. A week later I bought the paper back edition and mailed it off to him. Two weeks later I receive an email from my friend. I QUOTE: \\"You [insert nasty word here], you did that on purpose. There I was. On the bus during rush hour. Strangers all around me. And am I sitting there staring straight ahead, making no eye contact with anyone like the rest of the passengers? No, oh no. Not me! I'm sitting there reading this book you sent me. And laughing my fool head off. Out loud! Some day, some way, I'll get you for this.\\" UNQUOTE <br />I've recommended this book to a lot of people. Every one loves it. If you like the feeling of experiencing uncontrollable laughter, you'll love it too.
0143058525|5.0|I have a feeling that if I had read this, rather then listened to her read it herself I would have found it rather self-absorbed and unenlightened as well. I would have liked, but perhaps not have loved it.  However, when you hear her read it you can hear all her texture, the pain, the confusion, the hope, etc. She is amazing and I totally fell in love with this woman. I related to many of her feelings, especially about breaking up with her lover and what that felt like and about her depression and spiritual quest. I absolutely adore Liz Gilbert and encourage everyone that loves people to listen to her CD's.
B000AP04OM|5.0|I have loved this movie since I was a kid and saw it in the theater.
B000K7VHJQ|5.0|I've been awaiting this two DVD collection for almost a year now and I can say that it was well worth the wait. This set includes the theatrical (original) version and a new \\"recut\\" version with I've come to call \\"the PG-13 cut\\" becuase it removes around three or four minutes of the harsh violence toward Christ that the theatrical version contained. The recut version is the cut most likely to be shown by churches and viewed by families due to the fact that the level of violence and bloodshed is greatly reduced. I aslo have to mention the special features on the second DVD. All the features are wonderful and very informative. As a student of film it is very interesting to see how Mel Gibson and crew created this Biblical epic. There are also features that just focus on the Biblical history and truth of Christ and his followers that have nothing to do with the making of the film. This is a DVD worth the purchase price.
B000J103OI|4.0|The title did not appeal to me as I would not normally be interested in a movie centered around the fashion industry, but a few minutes into to the movie and I actually found it to be entertaining. Meryl Streep plays her character superbly. Her character is complex, for the person she is, is not necessarily the person she has allowed herself to become. Of course there is humor, idealism and rich glitz to add appeal to the movie, but in the end it is about choices, and perhaps the chance to do things differently albeit, vicariously.

0307237699|2.0|Obama recognises quite rightly that America is divided but then he goes on to say that he is the answer to the problem. A person, any person, who regards himself as the center around which a society should revolve is a person of so base in morals that he will soon become dangerous. In assigning   himself the role of Political Saviour, he exalts himself above everyone else. This is fatal!
B000002GYR|4.0|I know Tom Waits mostly from his later material.  Based on the reviews, I was looking forward to this album.  For me, it came up a little short. <br /> <br />This album contains romantic songs performed seriously, and it's just not as playful as some of his later albums.  Call me crazy, but I prefer the gravelly voice of his older years.  Maybe I'm disappointed because I didn't come in with a clean slate. <br /> <br />That being said, there are some excellent songs on this.  \\"Ol' 55\\", \\"I Hope I Don't Fall in Love with You\\" and \\"Grapefruit Moon\\" are all wonderful.  Some of the others?  Well, let's just say not wonderful. <br /> <br />I think of Tom Waits as Captain Hook in Shrek II.  This isn't that guy.

B000L53D4O|5.0|We bought this toy when my son was about 11 months old.  He had been pulling up to standing for quite some time, but just hadn't made the transition to walking yet.  As soon as saw this toy he immeditiately pulled to standing and started taking steps!  Now, 2 months later, he still uses it even though he can walk on his own.  He loves pushing it around the house. <br /> <br />I saw some reviews on the musical version of this toy where some said that the toy was not good for kids pulling up to standing.  My son weighed about 20 lbs when he first got it and never had any issues pulling up.  The toy never fell over from his weight.

B000002UJQ|5.0|If THE BENDS was a surprising gust of cool air for listeners after PABLO HONEY, Radiohead's third album, OK COMPUTER, was a strong punch in the face.  In the ten years since its release, the album has become one of the most respected and acclaimed recordings of all time, hailed by many as the greatest album ever recorded.  It's a masterpiece in a league of its own, far superior to anything else the band ever recorded, and a firm reminder that Radiohead may be, or at least was at one time, the best band since The Beatles.    OK COMPUTER is a chilled collection of poignant, haunting pieces that are more \\"messages\\" than \\"songs\\", highlighted by the brilliant 6 1/2-minute \\"Paranoid Android\\", Radiohead's own \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\".  It's a thoroughly haunting album, thanks to some poetic but largely undecipherable lyrics, conspicuous guitar parts, and, of course, Thom Yorke's pained yet defiant vocals.  Granted, PABLO HONEY and THE BENDS weren't the most upbeat albums, but OK COMPUTER is morosity at its finest.  Yorke and the band left behind most of PABLO HONEY's hostility when they recorded THE BENDS, but they picked a lot of it back up for OK COMPUTER - the difference is that this time they know how to channel it.    OK COMPUTER was also the album on which Radiohead (or was it just Thom Yorke?) really began playing around with their \\"soundscape\\".  They'd experimented with it a little on THE BENDS, particularly on the opening track, \\"Planet Telex\\", but it was on OK COMPUTER when they really began exploring soundscapes, which they would continue to do heavily on their subsequent albums.  OK COMPUTER's airy, industrial sound was applauded by fans and critics because it was used to enhance the album's humanist, disillusioned message.  On subsequent albums, however, the band ventured into the realm of techno music, a move that lost them a LOT of fans.  Thus OK COMPUTER is considered by many of the band's older fans to be the point at which the old Radiohead ends and the new, inferior Radiohead begins.  I disagree.    OK COMPUTER is an album you simply must have.  It's also an album that will need a few listens to win the listener over, but after those listens, the more you listen to it, the more you'll come to realize just what a brilliant piece of work it really is.  This is undoubtedly one of the finest albums of all time, and quite possibly among the twenty or even ten best ever recorded.  Radiohead still released some stellar albums after this one, but OK COMPUTER remains the group's supreme masterwork.
B00000IZOR|4.0|I was really excited to see this toy because it reminded me of the one I had when I was little.  My only issue is the too long pull cord.  I was going to cut it at first, but then decided to take the phone apart and put it inside the phone.  That way I can take it back out when my son is older.
B000002IST|3.0|Te best of this album goes to \\"Driving the last Spike\\" and \\"Fading Lights\\"  \\"Dreaming while you sleep is ain't bad also.    The just OK tracks, there good, but won't make history are \\"No son's of mine\\", \\"Jesus he knows me\\" and \\"Hold on my Heart\\" These three are good for air plays and are well constructed songs.  Not the kind I prefer but good tunes for most of the music lovers. \\"Never a time is ain't bad, even it wasn't a radio success.    The really bad cuts are \\"Tell me why\\", \\"Living forever\\", \\"Way of the world\\" and \\"Since I lost you\\"

B000068FXR|4.0|Even as a 20+ year metalhead, I love this cd. Many different sounds emerge. From the cool vibe of 'Aint Nobody but Me' to the heavier sounding 'Sister Moonshine' with everything in between., this album brings back the fun of the 70's that only Supertramp could provide. They definately were one of the best alt/rock bands out in that decade and are sorely missed. Just good pop that stands the test of time. Must Have.
B000E1ZBH2|5.0|I have seen this one and the one with Colin Firth,and this is by far my favorite! So good,that I had to order it. Rosamund Pike makes a much more believable \\"beautiful\\" oldest sister Jane where in the Firth version,I could not stomach how the mother kept referring to the very unnatractive Susannah Harker's character Jane,as being beautiful and so much prettier than Jennifer Ehle's Elizabeth,which would be a laugh,except she is so unattractive,that it makes you dislike the very unlikeable, flaky, mother even more! I detested her,almost as much as the very shrill- trampy Lydia!<br /><br />The romance between Jane and Mr. Bingley is also more developed in this version,where in the Firth version,it is non-existant,so is it totally unbelievable that Elizabeth even makes a fuss over Mr. Darcy's involvement in parting them,and that Jane and Mr. Bingley would even end up marrying! Also the early relationship between Lizzy and Mr. Darcy is much more developed in this version.<br /><br />Everyone and everything about this version is much more attractive and likeable! I find the Firth version full of cold,unattractive people,and totally unbelievable,and unmoving.<br /><br />If the Firth version with it's creepy, totally/unattractive/unlikable characters is more true to the book,then I have no desire to ever read the book!

B000025OTV|4.0|This is the only Paolo Conte CD I've heard.  I bought it after hearing <br />the intoxicating Via con Me track from the German movie \\"Mostly Martha\\". <br />Unfortunately, the Via con Me track on this CD is not identical, and not <br />as suavely romantic as the movie track.  In my view, the large collection of songs are rather hit and miss, but not a bad value for <br />the price.  Highlights include Elisir, Gong-Oh, Alle Prese con una Verde Milonga, and Ballato Di Tutto.  Best songs keep to his rhythmic swing <br />and pulsating piano with catchy key changes.  There's also some nice <br />stand-up bass and guitar on a few tracks.  Songs fall flat when too <br />experimental with voice or tacky musical stylings.  Overall, a decent introduction, but I'd be shocked if one of the other compilations wasn't more elegant and swinging.

B000N3AXQU|5.0|When the lights came up on 1990's Rocky V, like most filmgoers, I thought that I'd seen the last of Rocky Balboa, the indomitable everyman who, through the course of five movies, took the heavyweight boxing title not once, but twice (and also singlehandedly won the Cold War). Certainly if you'd told me then that we'd get the chance to revisit this character nearly two decades on, I would've called you crazy. <br /> <br />And yet, like his cinematic alter-ego of thirty years, writer-director-star Sylvester Stallone apparently still had \\"some stuff left in the basement,\\" and here we are sixteen years later, with Sly once more lacing up those padded gloves and stepping into the squared circle for one final (\\"We really mean it this time!\\") bout. <br /> <br />I guess that's why, for me, there was a bittersweetness to watching Rocky Balboa. The whole experience had the feeling of seeing a friend you never thought you'd meet again, knowing you have to say goodbye before too long. If that sounds a trifle maudlin, so be it. Nevertheless, with this character, the big-hearted fighter from South Philly, Stallone assured his own place in the annals of filmdom by creating one of the most indelible, enduring, iconic roles in movie history. So it's hard not to feel attached to the big lug. <br /> <br />In Rocky Balboa, the two-time former champ is at his lowest ebb personally. His beloved wife Adrian has passed away (from \\"the woman's cancer\\"), his son is a largely-infrequent presence in his life, and he mostly spends time at his semi-successful Italian restaurant regaling customers with tales of his former glory. This is a Rocky at the twilight of his career, largely pushed to the wayside by things shinier and newer. This is a Rocky who has become, in essence, the guest star of his own story. And yet...he still has something to offer (cue Bill Conti's \\"Gonna Fly Now\\"). <br /> <br />The \\"Rocky\\" story is a timeless myth for the ages (yes, even the fourth one). More than that, the entire Rocky cinematic cycle, from 1976's original through the four sequels and now with Rocky Balboa, represents a singular achievement in movie lore: tracking the life and times of a single fictional character, essentially in real time, over the course of three decades. We've seen the highs, we've seen the lows, and now we're seeing him off. <br /> <br />Rocky Balboa is a fitting (and welcome) coda for a character with whom we all were able to go the distance.
B000M341QE|4.0|the ending to this movie is  silly and ridiculous. it's totally implausable. so is jack nicholson's performance. to be believeable his charactor would have to be both frightening and brilliant. as jack plays him he's neither. he's just over the top jack. as usual. nicholson has got to be the most overrated actor in resent memory. he almost ruins this movie. the script has other problems besides the ending as well. a fool would have known leo was the rat but nicholson's charactor can't figure it out.  anyway, this is a long movie that's very entertaining (for the most part) until the ridiculous ending. leo has developed into a very good actor and damon ain't bad either. so, if you can put up with jack and the ending it's worth the 15 bucks.
B000002LCK|5.0|Anyone who says this is not one of the best CD's ever is an idiot.  The music, although (I can't believe it) is 20 yrs old now, is still fresh and so ultimately energetic and dance inspiring ! It's the only CD I've bought at least 3 times and it keeps 'disappearing'.. I'll forgive my friends and others who must borrow and keep it forever... I'll keep buying it because it's that good I must keep it in my collection.. I'm finally going to wise-up and burn it to my Ipod.. Hopefully I can keep that :)

B000B5Y00U|5.0|Three unalterably supreme elements contribute to the abiding love I hold for this, my favorite recorded Traviata: the singing of Montserrat Caballe and Carlo Bergonzi, and these two artists' faithfulness to Verdi's score. There is little I can add to the perfect comments below of Bartolome Mesa Gil \\"TOLO\\". With a few knowing words, he hits upon the essence of a genuine singing art - fidelity to the composer's indicated markings, and the gifts of humility that lead a singer to trust the music, finding through that faithfulness alone all the drama required to bring an operatic score to eternal life. Caballe is the finest purveyor of these irreplaceable qualities of muscianship I've ever encountered in a singer. This recording holds those elements supremely to the fore, qualities that make it the most fulfilling Traviata I've heard in forty years of listening. Search far and wide; a singer who trusts the score is a singer who will inevitably divulge its riches with everlasting conviction. Caballe and Bergonzi meet that test with a devoted embrace, and raise the operatic art by the gift of their musical faithfulness. A recording to treasure.
B0000TB03W|4.0|I've been a fan of Shania Twain since her first album.  I was never a big country music fan, but Shania's music crosses the boundaries of pop, rock and country.  I'm a professional musician (drummer for Electric Prunes, Linda Ronstadt, etc.)and I thoroughly enjoyed this video presentation of one of her best live concerts.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|From the first time I heard Celtic Woman televised on NH public broadcasting I became a fan.  I have been to a live concert and have the DVDs for both concerts as well as thier individual CDs. Their voices are like musical instruments, their choices of music for the performances are uplifting. In my opinion Celtic Woman has created a national treasure for Ireland and furthered the awareness of the richly spiritual culture.
B00000K19E|5.0|This is a great movie, but in a unique way.  It's not the acting or special effects (though they were great).  It the melding of many myth themes.  If all you want is a sci-fi flick, you may not be overly impressed, but if you are the type to look more deeply at things you'll see there is a lot more to this movie than entertainment.  This movie has the ability to impart valuable lessons that harmonize with ancient on modern themes.  It's difficult to put a movie like this into words.  Seeing it is best. <br />Not a young kids' movie though.  Lots of violence, etc.
B00000K31Q|5.0|Regardless of whether 10 Things I Hate About You (from here on out referred to as 10 Things...)is based on a Shakespeare work or not, the end result has stayed relevent after all this time.<br /><br />10 Things... is the only teen movie I can think of that falls into every possible cliche situation but somehow comes out on top every time. From Patrick singing across the football field to Kat to Bianca ditching the pretty-boy Joey for the newbie, unpopular, Cameron, for some reason it all works perfectly. I'm convinced the reason this film is so good and is able to carry such a worn plot is because of the cast. Julia Styles and Heath Ledger are really convincing as a couple and, oddly enough, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Larisa Oleynik also seem to work wonderfully together.<br /><br />The plot revolves around five characters. Basically, Cameron and his school-showing guide/friend concieve this idea to get a rich guy named Joey to pay Patrick to date Kat, so that Cameron can date Kat's younger sister, Bianca. Cliches and chaos ensues!<br /><br />10 Things... is your average boy gets girl/boy loses girl/boy gets girl back movie, times two since there's two relationships blossoming. If you like those types of movies, 10 Things... is sure to please. For others, the comedy throughout makes all the 'chick flick' parts worth it. Not to mention the quote-ability that this movie's got. Just one gripe though, what's with skimping on the special features?! Release a special edition already!

B000M06K5C|2.0|Let me preface this by saying that I loved Silent Alarm and listen to it all of the time. I am also an avid music fan and i'm willing to follow a band as it grows in new and exciting directions. <br /> <br />...the problem with this album is that it isn't very exciting. <br /> <br />This album sounds like it could be promising after the first two songs. The first track \\"Song For Clay\\" evolves from being slow and melancholy into a driving rythymic song not dissimilar to the sounds found on Silent Alarm. The second song, \\"Hunting For Witches,\\" also made me smile upon first hearing the eclectic intro. It's very unique and at this point I got very excited to hear the rest of the album to see where Bloc Party would take me next.    <br /> <br />That's when things began to go downhill. \\"Waiting For The 7.18\\" Is somewhat generic and uninteresting but still listenable. \\"The Prayer\\" has an exceptionally boring chorus which is paired with some unexceptional lyrics: \\"Tonight make my unstoppable and I will charm, I will slice, I will dazzle them with my wit\\"? <br /> <br />From here the album just devolves into a plethora of similar-sounding drum-driven songs with little of the flashy, biting guitar riffs that were so predominant on Silent Alarm. In fact, one of the most glaring flaws with this album is the seeming absence of any fiery Silent Alarm-esque guitar riffs whatsoever. Instead you are presented with a mileu of songs with Kele singing in a very similar manner and boring instrumentations.  <br /> <br />I sat waiting for one of the songs to really open up and launch into a barrage of noise but it really never happened. The best example of this is \\"Where Is Home?\\" - It sounds like they completely forgot to add the guitar when they mixed it. It sounded quite promising but instead it's basically Kele singing over the same drum-beat that we hear on the rest of the album for most of the song.   <br /> <br />Speaking of which, the drum-beats on \\"Where Is Home?\\", \\"Sunday\\", \\"On\\",and \\"The Prayer\\" all sound shockingly similar.  <br /> <br />This is more reminiscent of a \\"Doves\\" album than Bloc Party. I believe that naturally evolving as a band shouldn't involve completely abandoning the sounds that created the foundation of your success as a band. These include the fiery guitar riffs and driving emotion behind Kele's vocals on Silent Alarm.  <br /> <br />I must conclude by saying that Bloc Party is one of my favorite bands. I want to be able to say that I love this album and reccomend it to everyone. The problem is that they sound very unlike the band heard on Silent Alarm. I welcome hearing new sounds from bands but this is a step in a completely unexpected and altogether boring direction in comparisson to their previous efforts. I couldn't imagine being excited to hear these songs in concert, unlike the Silent Alarm era songs.
B000067CPX|5.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers are unquestionably the greatest band that has ever lived. Evolving in a storybook-like fashion from having sold roughly 25,000 copies of their debut album, to the 13 million Californication accumulated. The band has experienced countless line-up change, heartbreaks, and tragic upheavals, giving the foursome a bleak future. 20 years ago, not a single person could have foretold this. By the Way came at a time when music begged for originality and uniqueness. It is lush, poignant, and immaculate; By the Way evokes fascination in all, as to what the band has transformed into.  <br /> <br />It begins with \\"By the Way\\", one of the only numbers on the entire album which have preserved the once quintessential funk and rap-driven verses. It is vastly discrepant to those of the other recordings found on the album, and is, thus, misleading. The intricate song structure evolves from mellow, harmonious and humble beginnings to a brazen verse and impeccably bridges into a melodic chorus. \\"Universally Speaking\\" follows. It's instantly apparent that this song has very few things relative to that of it's predecessor. The song has a sort of Doo-whop feeling as it bridges expressively from the verse into a 60's-type chorus.  <br /> <br />\\"This Is the Place\\" has to be one of the most beautiful tracks on the entire album. It begins with a modest base line (which is played throughout the entire song), and gives way to Chad's lustrous drum beat and Anthony's masterful lyrics; it contains some of the best song-writing I have ever seen, though one never knows what he is actually alluding to. John comes in with a seemingly invisible guitar segment; all until the chorus, when it brings through stunning life altering sounds. The most notable segment is the conclusion, when Kiedis sing unwaveringly, and John pounds furiously on his guitar. \\"Dosed\\" follows, which is elegant, wispy, and, for some reason, makes me feel as if I were in an Arctic blast. Four guitar lines run luxuriantly through the song.  <br /> <br />\\"Don't Forget Me\\" has the most intricate and zealous guitar-playing I have ever heard. Like \\"This Is the Place\\", the exact same base-line is played perpetually until the conclusion. Anthony's haunting and ubiquitous voice resonates in your mind, as John picks masterfully at his guitar. Following the first and second choruses, astonishingly intricate solos are given by Frusciante. Each one is an ecstasy of euphoric delirium, executed with impeccable perfection. \\"The Zephyr Song\\" comes next, and seems as though it were lifted directly out of the 70's. It's psychedelic nature stands out wondrously.  <br /> <br />\\"Can't Stop\\" is, without a doubt, my favorite song, ever. It starts fast paced, but somewhat quiet, until it reaches the climax. An amazing bridge to the verse is played by John. The verse is far better than the chorus, as Frusciante provides majestic backing vocals. Amazing song. \\"I Could Die for You\\", the shortest song on the album, is hard to describe. It's elegant and beautiful and gentle in it's nature. The track is quiet, yet perky and alive, as though driven by an enveloping, fervent, fanatical force.  \\"Midnight\\" is another gem. The sounds which it engages have rarely been seen elsewhere. It is so unique, as each one of the songs are. Melodic and lush, bare and unsparing. \\"Throw Away Your Television\\" is the funkiest number on the album, though certain sections imply an innovative sense, and as though one were experiencing a whirlwind of nuance and jet speed illustriousness.  <br /> <br />\\"Cabron\\" is an experimental track, which has a tang of Latin influences, hence the name, and is played exclusively on an acoustic guitar. It is another vastly dissimilar song which contradicts much of its colleagues. \\"Tear\\", a striking and lethargic (and long) song is an unexpected tribute to the Beach Boys. A magical trumpet solo is performed by Flea, which allows the song to prevent itself from becoming lost on the record.\\"On Mercury\\" is, if there had to be one, the weakest track on the entire album. The faux ska sound simply sparks too much turmoil between the songs it surrounds, and does not fit in with the grand message which By the Way is attempting to articulate.  <br /> <br />It is succeeded by an outstanding track, however: \\"Minor Thing\\", which shows, blatantly, how much Kiedis has evolved as both a lyricist and a singer. His compelling and spellbinding voice gives way to the enchanting, enthralling and captivating guitar playing given by John. \\"Warm Tape\\" is possibly the most mysterious and inexplicable track the Chili Peppers have ever produced. The sound is difficult to describe, as it seems to squirm in a sensual manner, unlike anything ever created.  <br /> <br />The final and longest song on By the Way, \\"Venice Queen\\", may be the most meaningful. It's mellow and windy intro gives one the sense of walking in a forest, while the bitter cold wind attacks you from all angles. It defines beauty, yet is as unforgiving as an astringent stone. Anthony comes in perfectly and begins singing in a depressed and crestfallen manner. Until, however, the song completely turns around and kicks itself into high gear. Near the halfway mark, it turns from a glum ballad to a driven acoustic melody, alluding to the death of Gloria Scott, a woman who aided Anthony in the fight against drugs. John provides majestic backing vocals, to make this song an amazing stand out.   <br /> <br />So, if you took the time to read why By the Way is the best album ever recorded, you'll purchase it. Carefree.  <br />
B000KCHZK6|5.0|By any stretch of imagination, \\"Not Too Late\\" is an immediate masterpiece. Gone are the cover versions of songs that weren't hers, and those dull lullabies that seven people took to cowrote. In its place are some gorgeous melodies with self-written lyrics that elevate this album from being a run of the mill affair to one of those rare animals - a bonafide classic.<br /><br />A note about the music - let the reviews not deter you. The music is very Norah-ish, in the best way possible, but there is something new here. What could be previously termed as \\"boring\\" is now \\"inspired\\". You won't fall asleep halfway through this album if you pay attention to the lyrics. It is so great to find an album these days that does not only speak about Love. And even though there are political messages on some of these songs, its muted enough to pass you by without offending you.<br /><br />Also, while I consider \\"Come Away with Me\\" and \\"Feels Like Home\\" contemporary American jazz albums (debatable by most, I agree), I think \\"Not Too Late\\" is her hands down \\"Southern\\" album, even though it speaks of the very things the South hates to hear about. Its amazing that an album like this would find an audience if Norah wasn't who she is, but that's the beauty of it all, I think.<br /><br />The standout here is \\"Wish I could\\", the opening track. Wow. The harmonies blend perfectly. The wonderful thing about this record is that Norah's voice is allowed to shine without the distraction of too much instrumentation (like on her second album). And while \\"Thinkin' About You\\" is hummable enough, its easily the most insipid track here - speaking of love in the most infantile sense possible. I think that she can afford to move beyond songs like these, pretty as they are.<br /><br />Will \\"Not Too Late\\" win any awards despite being at least twice as better than her \\"Come Away with Me\\" album? Probably not. The reason being that Norah is not perceived as \\"new\\" or \\"fresh\\" anymore. However, if you listen to this CD, it's the freshest thing out of the Jones stable so far. My favorite little piece other than the opener is \\"The Sun Doesn't Like You\\" - listen and discover! What makes me really happy about this album is the Repeat Value it carries - I have already played it about six times at work through and through and it just gets better on repeat listening.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and pick this up, just to discover where American music is headed in general. This is a wonderful time for American music, and it's a testament to her growth and evolution that Norah Jones is the flagbearer for a new music generation. Yes, true talents like Joanna Newsom, Regina Spektor and Fiona Apple still don't get the adulation that they deserve, but if artists like Jones can win acclaim, it proves that theres justice after all.<br /><br />Five Stars. Recommended without any reservations!sten to this CD, it's the freshest thing out of the Jones stable so far.

0517154528|5.0|What a great book of explanation. He gives many of his normal habits to us that are away from all the other advise of investors and financial advisors. His whys may sound old fashioned but look at his record and you will be old fashioned also if you could obtain what he did. I will read any and all of his other books now. I only see one listed at this point but will hope to find him writing more. I have been in the Magellian fund since 1986 and his success has proven itself to me personally.

B000M5AJQS|5.0|Man, it's good to finally see a really good Martin Scorsese movie again, seeing that his last really good one was probably \\"Casino.\\"  It's been too long since he did a good old fashioned bad-a**ed mob movie, and no one does it like he does.  The cinematography was sweet, the soundtrack was your usual old rock set, the story extremely well-written and riveting, and every performance was perfect.  This is officially one of the best movies he's made (the others being \\"Taxi Driver\\" and \\"Goodfellas,\\" all in my opinion of course).  From the beginning of \\"The Departed\\" you get sucked right into the world of organized crime, police corruption, and some intense cat-and-mouse action.  While the movie is two and a half hours long, it does not drag on in the least bit, because Scorsese has that way of making every scene worth seeing.  If you can handle nonstop profanity and some often-times brutal violence, then definitely check this out, because there's a lot more to this movie than gore and \\"the f-word.\\"  If you're a film buff who loves a good mob movie, then get this, because Scorsese has finally returned and done what he does best.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|The epidome of hard rock. A capturing of an era at its very very best. <br />Wasn't always good with the studio work, kind of dry for me. <br />If you only own one UFO cd, this is it bar none.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Following the story line exactly may take a couple of viewings, but that isn't necessary to enjoy this movie.  While most British comedies appeal to a certain brand of American viewers, this movie breaks that mold.  Both my wife and I loved it, and we have very different tastes in comedy.  The cast is top notch, and all of them give memorable performances.  One of my favorite comedies in recent years.
0460873644|5.0|For the past several years, I continually heard the name \\"Dorian Gray\\". As curiosity got the best of me, I finally looked this person up on the Internet. Finding that Dorian Gray was the main character of a most elaborate and interesting tale, enthralled me. Therefore, I set out to read this novel. From the preface alone, I was spellbound and couldn't put the book down.<br /><br />Lord Henry, with his quips and one-liners literally made me think twice. His tranquil ability to convince anyone of anything, sans Basil Hallward, amazed me. Although, I did find a few opinions of Lord Henry to ring true, for the most part I found myself thinking: \\"He's absolutely correct. Oh, wait! That's completely immoral and self-indulgent!\\" Needless to say, Lord Henry was my favorite character in the book.<br /><br />This book truly puts one's own life into perspective. It makes one think, and re-think of the importance of being true to only oneself without influence of others. As Lord Henry said it best:  \\"Because to influence a person is to give him one's own soul. He does not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else's music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is self-development. To realize one's nature perfectly - that is what each of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to oneself\\".
B00005RDRO|5.0|I first saw this movie as a young man, and I was amazed at the sheer number of first-rate acting talent it contained.  With stars like:  Peter Falk, David Niven, Peter Seller and Alec Guinness (to name a few) this movie should have been a more mainstream success, but sadly remains a cult-classic.  The main appeal of this film, comes in the form of it's spoofing of the Detective drama, and the methods of classic TV and Movie sleuths.  If you are fond of movies like \\"Scarey Movie,\\" then you should enjoy this one.  The script and acting are top-notch, especially the characterization of Detective Wong, by Peter Sellers.  If you like Charlie Chan, Sam Spade, or the Thin Man movies, you will easily appreciate the humor and repect the writer give to the story.  It is especially funny, seeing these loner detectives trying to tell each other how to solve a case.  Even if you don't favor the realm of crime drama, there is more than enough goofy sight gags and slapstick comedy to appeal to most anyone.  I hope you enjoy!
0670034711|5.0|This is the 2nd copy I've bought of this book.  I ordered several for my family and gave away my copy.  I wanted one for myself for my library and am reading it again for the 3rd time.  This book expands one's mind as it follows one woman's journey in this path called life.  One of the most enjoyable books I've read.
B000024QML|5.0|Much has been made about this being a definitive lyrical moment for the band and I can certainly see why their gay fan base would feel this way.  But for straight men who just happen to like 80s style music this is a fantastic cd.  I have a hard time understanding how anyone could dislike 'A Different Point of View' - it's brilliant in every way.<br /><br />The boys hold their own like never before for the length of this cd.<br /><br />Certainly worth having in your collection.
B000FZETKC|5.0|I am a huge fan of the legendary Hughes films of the Eighties.  This is the sleeper of the bunch.  A true hidden jem not just of the Hughes films, but all of those teenage films that dominated 80's theater.  This is the last true masterpiece that he created.  He followed his string of teenage targeted sucesses with Uncle Buck & Home Alone.  He never returned back to his roots.  This is the ultimate love story of all his films & a glorious grand finale.      I wrote my first review of Some Kind of Wonderful on Feb. 15th, 2007.  I recently had to do a report for school about teen films so I chose one of my favorites... this one.  I am posting an abridged version of my report; a better review I hope.      The 80's were the greatest for teen movies in general.  John Hughes' was by far the man known to define 1980's outstanding cinema with a list of the most known teen films of that decade.  Sixteen Candles, Breakfast Club, Weird Science, Pretty in Pink, and Ferris Bueller's Day Off all have to be mentioned if anyone is discussing teen movies in general.  These were all hits and are still popular amongst diehard fans of that era in film.  John Hughes would go on to write, produce, and / or direct Uncle Buck, the hit Home Alone & the odd, but funny Planes, Trains, & Automobiles.  He had a way of understanding teen issues of the day and was able to express them in his writing and in his directing.    1987's Some Kind of Wonderful is an interesting teen love triangle in the vein of another Hughes film, Pretty in Pink.  This film has a fantastic cast and practically a perfectly written script.  Numerous characters are well thought out and developed within the film; not just thrown together to be shown once only to be forgotten ten minutes later... well maybe with the exception of the Mom character.  It is very easy to be drawn into this world of 80's teenage angst.  The sensationally edgy soundtrack helps to achieve this by bringing more emotion from the fabulous performances of the excellent ensemble.        Some Kind of Wonderful opens up with the character Watts rapidly playing on some drums.  The rhythm drives the initial and traditional 80's montage that introduces all of the main players.  The beautiful Watts is played by the fresh faced Mary Stewart Masterson.  Her bobbed blonde hair is very reminiscent of Human League's Susan Ann Sulley.  Mary truly steals the film with an absolutely amazing performance as the heart torn best friend.  Watts is a tomboy from the wrong side of town and best friend to the main character in the film Keith.  The curious and hard working Keith Nelson is played by Eric Stoltz.  Keith is a loner artist from a blue collar family from the same neighborhood as Watts.  The gorgeous Amanda Jones is next introduced in the arms of her rich and popular boyfriend.  Amanda is played by the wonderful actress Lea Thompson.  Hardy Jenns, Amanda's snobbish and obnoxious boyfriend is played by Craig Sheffer.  Some may recognize him as the quarterback alongside James Caan in the awesome 1990's college football film, The Program. These four consist of the main force that drives this film.      Keith works after school as an auto mechanic and gas station attendant saving money for his unknown future. When he is not working he spends his time either painting and illustrating or hanging out with his pal Watts.  Keith is an admirer of the popular and totally taken Amanda Jones.  His interest increases and he totally falls for her.  A glimmer of hope begins to shine for Keith when Amanda and her A hole of a boyfriend's relationship starts to crumble.  Keith consults his good friend Watts for advice in his quest for love.  She does not respond in kind and repeatedly explains to him that there is no chance for him to ever go out with Amanda who hangs out with the rich kids.  Hardy, Amanda's boyfriend realizes Keith's interest in his girlfriend and tensions start to build between them.  Tension increases between the frustratedgood friend Watts and the clueless Keith as he continues to plan to win the heart of Amanda...    If you want to know how this all ends you will have to see the movie.  No sense in ruining it for you.    There has to be a definite mention of the high school bully Skinhead named Duncan.  He is awesomely played by Elias Koteas; a little reminiscent of a young De Niro at times.  There are a couple of scenes with a young Candace Cameron playing Keith's youngest sister; one where she is shuffling through some awesome Garbage Pail Kids cards.  Candace played the oldest sister on the show Full House.      Interestingly there is a sneaky Rolling Stones theme throughout this film. The main character, Keith, is named after Keith Richards the legendary guitarist. Keith's best friend Watts who is an obsessed percussionist is named after the drummer from the Rolling Stones, Charlie Watts.  Last, but not least Amanda Jones is a Rolling Stones song and is used twice in the movie.  On another music note Chyna Phillips plays the other love interest of Amanda's boyfriend Hardy.  Chyna was part of the 90's band Wilson / Phillips and the daughter of Mamma & the Pappa's John and Michelle Phillips.    Some Kind of Wonderful is a one of a kind; truly a great movie.  It did not reach the same status as Hughes' other classics.  Sadly this film was advertised poorly and many thought it was just a rehash of Pretty in Pink.  Regardless this was the last true teen masterpiece that Hughes made in the 80's.  Now there are a dime a dozen American Pie type clones thrown together that cannot tell a story as fraction as well as John Hughes could.  Sadly he is no longer around and passed away a few years back.  Luckily he left us with a great bunch of films that give us all a glimpse into the life of a teen and a view of the 80's.
0553588486|5.0|It's been a long time since a book kept me up all night, and then I get three in a row, George R.R. Martin's A Game of Thrones and its sequels, A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords.  Now I'm off to the library for the fourth, A Feast for Crows, and I've already checked out Martin's website to find out when the fifth one comes out.<br /><br />Instant addiction, that's what these books are, a mesmerizing epic fantasy of the family Winterfell, with marvelous characterizations (in particular the two girls, Arya and Daenerys, and the dwarf lord Tyrion), and a plot with more twists and turns than a sidewinder.  There is love and lust, loyalty and betrayal, noble houses rise and kings fall, and let's not forget the creepiest boogeymen ever, known simply as \\"the Others.\\"  A wonderfully realized world, I can't wait to get back to it.
B000006GDB|5.0|this is a very weird little video nasty thats a sequal to suspiria it has beautiful colors but its a little random its still enjoyable the soundtracks unbelievable
B000001ESF|5.0|Amid the laughable radio offerings of the late 70's (disco, soft rock, and bad new wave groups) Rush stood out. \\"2112\\" is a great album by an innovative power trio slamming out great tunes.     Alex, Geddy and Neil have a chemistry that you can feel during the galloping riff of the rocking title track. They know what to play and when to play it, perfectly complementing each other. This twenty-minute song changes from blazing rips to mellow guitar work, with waterfall sound effects in the background, and it never loses steam. The awesome rhythm and lead guitar work, heavy growling bass lines, and otherworld drumming makes this one of my favorite Rush tunes. \\"A Passage To Bangkok\\" is another rocking tune with goofy lyrics about weed, which seemed a lot cooler back in the day. \\"The Twilight Zone\\" is a sort of commercial sounding happy tune, but the guitar picking during the chorus is eerie - nice contrast. \\"Lessons\\" is another upbeat tune similar to something heard on \\"Caress of Steel\\", another great disc by the way. The ballad \\"Tears\\" (keyboards played by graphic designer, Hugh Syme) is a bit weak but not a bad. However, \\"Something for Nothing\\" closes out the disc in grand fashion.     The only possible negative about Rush is many people don't like the nasal whiny vocals of Geddy Lee. I never noticed this since I was too focused on the musicianship, but his singing seems to have improved with age. I doubt people will listen to this in 2112 and find it as exciting as it seemed in 1976, but musicians (if they still exist) will surely acknowledge the incredible talents of Lee, Lifeson, and Peart.
B000KC8O3S|5.0|Talk about knowing how to use an orchestra to its full advantage.  I really enjoy a good orchestral score and it's difficult to find that in television.  However, Murray Gold has composed some of the most haunting, electrifying, emotional and just plain lively music to accompany one of the best shows on television.  His music is a distinctive but integral part of each show - just try to imagine watching Doomsday or The Girl in the Fireplace without the music.  I particularly like his use of motifs throughout the series, especially for Rose, the Daleks and the Cyberman - it's a way of subconsciously identifying the character before you even see them (my favorites are Rose's Theme and The Face of Boe).  The CD is long - 75 minutes - and you certainly get your money's worth.  I didn't particularly like the two songs performed by Neil Hannon but only because it didn't seem to fit - orchestral music and then a song in the middle of the CD?  It just felt odd.  The accompanying music notes written by Murray Gold is also enlightening.  I collect a lot of film scores and this is certainly going to be one of my favorites...<br /><br />** Update 18 February 2007:  I've been watching the episodes again on DVD and I've realized \\"Song for Ten\\" is a goodbye song.  I have a thing - I can't hear the lyrics of a song unless I really concentrate which I usually don't.  But I concentrated and this song is really sad despite its catchy tune.  This is the song you first hear at the end of The Christmas Invasion and here it's almost a premonition of Doomsday.  And I just watched School Reunion again and the melody was playing at the end when Sarah Jane and the Doctor are saying goodbye.  The more I hear this song, the more I like it...
B000060MWU|5.0|I saw this movie after Mulholland Dr.  I was in love with Mulholland from the second it started, but when I watched Lost Highway for the first time it did more for me than Mulholland ever could.  If you know Lynch's style, then you know this will be a real thinker, or as I like to call it, a mindf***.  The film is like a puzzle that will keep you guessing all the while you're watching it, and keep you thinking long after it's finished.  I still have not been able to complete the puzzle myself.  The puzzle seems much more accessible than Mulholland, though.  I believe Lynch's works are like poems that are meant to be interpreted.  Whether there is a certain interpretation he hopes you come to, that's another story.  But I think with Lost Highway you can come much closer to the truth than Mulholland, which is why I rate it as his best so far(though I haven't seen his shorts, Eraserhead or Wild at Heart; they're on my list).
B00005614M|5.0|Having only recently jumped on the Jazz scene as a 24 year veteran of the drum, i don't know as if i am qualified to write a review for those into this boat, but i must say that as a neophyte, i am and will be for a long time to come, a Davis fan. And this, the birth of the cool is an album that i will treasure as one of my own. very smooth sounds, breathy on the horns and completely listenable, a must have for any burgeoning collection.
B0000019HU|5.0|This record...is brilliant. No filler. No hits. No traditional songs. 7 minute mind-blowing works of art? Yes. <br /> <br />I can't remember where I heard of Slint or why I got this, but I assure you that I regret neither. The record encorporates a sense of paranoia, hope, faith, depression, lonliness, confusion and spite. It is a rare recording. A masterpiece. Never equaled before. Never equaled since. The openening of \\"Don, Aman\\" is an acapella breakdown leading into an ocean of strings, \\"Washer\\" is unequaled in gorgeous \\"heart-on-sleeve\\" humility. \\"Nosferatu Man\\" haunts like a bad dream, \\"Good Morning, Captain\\" sticks to so many surfaces, only to all be unglued with the blood-curdling screams of \\"I Miss You.\\"  <br /> <br />Stop reading. <br />Get this record NOW. <br />Listen.

B000JBWWQ0|5.0|I loved this movie.  I have read 2 other James Redfield books.  This movie was wonderful. a visual tool for those on the path to whatever enlightenment is for you.  I loved the physical demonstrations of energy fields and how our thoughts and past programming effect our energy fields especially as we try to relate to each other.  I loved the visual demonstrations of our connection to each other everywhere all the time and the AHAs of our main character as he opens up and learns how to listen with his awareness to all the information that is being sent his way to help him on his journey.  I hihgly  recommend this movie.
B000FUF6QS|3.0|Absolutely a product of both its time and Christopher Lee, this B film embarrasses everyone, including Edward Woodward, who, four years later, would redeem his career in BREAKER MORANT. Here though, he plays a Scottish copper sent to the Hebrides to investigate the disappearance of a little girl. It is all so Scottish pagan ritualistic as to be laughable. The only thing worse than fat Yanks tarting around in overstretched plaid skirts, is the folks who believe in the sttylized myths that go along with this stuff.  <br />Truth be told, there is one salient reason to watch this film and that's to see various folk copping a snog wth their clothes on outside a pub and more importantly, watching Britt Eklund dance around naked. Peter Sellers was a lucky bastard. Eklund is the definitive piece of well..... It will never occur to you that she can not act. Never.  <br />Woodward, on the other hand, was the real deal. He could not have been paid very much for this, or if he was, that explains the rest of the film's production values. Lee is the Emperor of Camp, and jeez o man, it lathers it on thick here. This nearly debunks his credentials in Lord of the Rings. There is a scene with him in a long black wig that is just too funny, especially post Peter Jackson. <br />As a lark, it is a funny film to watch. Maybe that was the intention. The really funny thing is that someone would decide to make an even more horrible re-make and feature  the world's worst actor ever, Nicholas Cage. <br />
B000641ZA4|5.0|These are the commercial successes, and they are great.  Worth every penny.
B00009QG73|5.0|Phenomenal performance! Roxy Music has always been a favorite of mine, but I had never seen them live or on DVD. This DVD has some incredible energy, great sound and video. The songs to me sound as good as or, in some cases, better than the original studio recordings. Case in point is my favorite \\"Mother of Pearl\\". I love the video editing of this song to include a very sexy black and white montage of dancers. The song picked up needed speed over the original. Everyone looks like they're having a great time on all of the tracks. I can't recommend this one enough.
B000I5X80G|5.0|Thankfully, Neil Young had the foresight to record nearly everything he performed over the years, video and tape, live show or studio setting.  It's possible that he shelved some of his best work; Example here is \\"Wonderin\\", not released until several years later.  This disc is classic Crazy Horse: Ragged, loping, fuzzy guitar and beautiful.  Turn off the lights, burn a candle and crank it up till the house is shaking.
B000055Y0X|5.0|For the purposes of this review, I will simply say pondering over the truths portrayed through a parallel sense of humor to horror will allow you to find a new world of wisdom, strength and beauty; one which you will wish to defend from the 'nuclear zone' after you absorb the film as opposed to the brilliance of George C. Scott then Peter Sellers.  Nothing can be more torturous to a person that the pangs of remorse which a guilty conscience can force upon him/her.  Some scholars and intellects with consensus among the father of my children and I believe the ultimate pangs of in United States governmental policy TODAY exists in the hidden agenda of remorse for releasing the 'nuclear zone' on the world in the prologue of the past while promotiing nuclear 'free' misunderstandings now in fear of retaliation for what the United States alone deliberately and democratically caused?  This genocide and holocaust masqued by end of war agreement between bi-polar personalities of Russia and America at very end of WWII when all knew so-called conventional warfare [and very little at that] was much more in now forgiving the taking of 650,000 innocent lives of women and children and old men unable to die for their cause.  The movie is not such a dark representation as reflected by these words but the impact is equal to the juvenile, trite societal constructs of entertainment even now [2007] in the realm of nuclear proliferation?  The best part is the usual disclaimer at the end about the film merely being a fictitious depiction of a real event that was triggered by the 'Cuban Missile Crisis' of 1962: then comes Kubreck to make people laugh at a height of the 'paths of glory' of the generals and evil ends [machinations] of devices of ultimate annihilation created and here to stay until the doomsday device: Ipod nuclear devices are harnessed.  Why not?  So what?  \\"To wake up to this danger, to look through the double talk on all sides which is used to prevent men from seeing the abyss toward which they are moving is the one obligation, the one moral and intellectual command which man must respect today.\\" [Erich Fromm] If he does not, we all will be doomed in an incremental staged process [and unipolar without the 'Cold War' players alone as two].

B000MCH5P4|5.0|Innaritu's films all contain different threads that somehow link together in the end to make a whole.. Not only that.. the seperate threads also contain themes which link the stories together to make a larger statement.. In 'babel' that story is of the inability to communicate.. Each story shows us some situation that went wrong in some way.. but the characters all were victims of not being understood.. 'Babel' is probably Innaritu's best work since 'Ammores Perros' took the international movie scene by storm.. It is a rich beautiful movie - intense, emotional, and visually gorgeous.. Its implications are enormous - it tells us a lot about how delicate our relations with the rest of the world can be.. This along with 'the departed' were the two best films of the year in my opinion.
B00003CXMG|5.0|I lived for music back in the early 70s.  Fillmore West every Thursday and Sunday night.  If I had kept the freebie posters safe I would have retired years ago.  As I watched this movie I began to get tinglings deep down in my soul as those memories were reawakened.  It was the unknown bands that Bill Graham found as his fifth and sixth acts that left me shaking my head and smiling.  That's what this movie captures.
B000HIVO64|3.0|This album feels like a transitional album that should go between Sea <br />Change and Guero, not after both of them. It has some very good songs <br />e.g. Think I'm in Love and No Complaints - both of which have great <br />grooves, catchy melodies, and the uniquely Beck mix of strange noises. <br />Unfortunately it also has a lot of duds, e.g. Strange Apparition, <br />which sounds like Beck weakly mimicking the Beatles, or Cellphone's <br />Dead, which features a bass line that is identical in rhythm and tone <br />to Chameleon by Herbie Hancock (get his album Head Hunters to hear the <br />original). <br /> <br />Bottom line, The Information is worth getting, but for me it doesn't <br />achieve the level of greatness Beck's hit on Midnite Vultures, Sea <br />Change, and Guero. More like a return to the inconsistency of Odelay.
0446677450|5.0|This is not a book for low-level financial advice, nor does it talk about a get-rich-quick scheme. Rather, Robert Kiyosaki tackles a much harder problem: he tries to motivate each one of us to take control of our lives, and to make us assume responsibility over our actions. This can-do attitude of fearless entrepreneurship goes beyond the usual five-to-eight commitment, he argues that we need to lose our sense of entitlement and strive to become financially self-sufficient. As other reviewers have pointed out, the stories themselves may not be factually true and a little exaggerated, but I found them to be inspiring and great motivators. If you plan for success, a couple of hours with this book is a sound investment of your time.
B000EWBNMS|5.0|Medium is an extremely well done show. It is the story of a woman that gradually becomes aware of her psychic abilities as she works as a paralegal at the DAs office. Eventually she becomes a consultant for the DA, which uses her insight to track murderers, serial killer, etc, helping with investigations that would otherwise go unsolved. The series is loosely based on the real life psychic and medium Allison Dubois, although many of the stories have been embellished and changed for the sake of good storytelling. However, the conflicts and issues of a real life \\"sensitive\\" are done extremely well and are very realistic. Allison is portaid as a very unglamorous figure, down to earth, with a normal husband and kids (well almost normal kids), trying to live a normal life while also staying true to the inner promptings and messages she is receiving that are obviously working through her to achieve some form of higher good. And Patricia Arquette is marvelous in playing this part, as is her very attractive actor that plays her loving husband. Excellent show, great entertainment that makes one think.

B000K7VHQE|5.0|If you grew up in a dysfunctional family, this movie will bring back to those wonderful times. Remember when you ran out of gas and you had to help push the car to the nearest gas station...while this car scene is the funniest thing you'll ever see. Remember sitting down for dinner while mom cooked fast-food food. Yea, I know...good times
B000KGGLCU|5.0|This was an absolutley amazing concert to see live!  I would have preferred she release her show from London on her birthday or the show that was taped in NYC (apparently there were tech difiiculties during the NYC show they filmed).  I have been a lifelong fan and have seen Madonna prior to this tour but she blew every performance out of the water with this tour.  Her voice has never been this strong and her energy level is admirable.  God knows I hope I can keep it up like this when I'm 47.  I also dj at a bar in Buffalo and some of the performances have become crowd favorites and people ask every week to see the videos for \\"Forbidden Love\\", \\"Erotica\\" and \\"Music Inferno\\".  The live bonus audio disc is great too.  I never thought I'd want to hear so much of Madonna singing live but she really nailed it this time around.  This is an absolute must have for any Madonna fan and for anyone on the fence about her, this should seal her role as Pop Queen.

B00003CXAE|3.0|Grease is great movie for all ages. Its funny and entertaining and you will learn to love the songs that are featured in it. Don't miss the opportunity, and get. It's a classical that you'll want to have for ever.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|I am someone who is annoyingly enironmentally conscious, I insist that we turn off lights in rooms around the house that we are not in; turn off the ignition everytime I stop the car for more than 5 seconds; use our bathwater for our first wash laundry cycle and dig our leftovers into the garden. My brother calls me a treehugger, my family sometimes gives me a freakish look, but even for me I was scared to watch this movie. But thanks to the hype it has gotten I got my non-hippilike family to watch with me and it made an impression. Everyone I have met who has watched it goes on about the problems with carbon and how they can reduce it, obviously it is hitting the mark and helping people feel like they can have some affect on this global warming problem.<br /><br />There is so much that is out of our hands and in the hands of the government, but this film shows that even our small efforts can help make a difference.<br /><br />I didn't like how it showed him riding around in airconditioned limosines and jetting around the country on his lecture circuit- seems like it would have made a better impression if he were riding around in electric cars or on his bicycle to at least one venue (but I guess safety issues would overrule).
0312330537|5.0|For the posters who say, \\"don't buy this book and support this ex-con\\" and \\"google this author to see how bad he was\\"... first you dont have to google him, you can flip the back of the book over and read for yourself, straight from the author.  second, if you kept reading, you'd see that he was recaptured and served out his time and deserves to have the slate wiped clean just as anyone else who's paid their dues. <br /> <br />Now, to the book... it's a wonderful and deliciously vibrant story with fascinating characters and some absolutely incredible circumstances thrust upon the author.  Technically it's a \\"fictional\\" novel but it rings so true it reads more like a biography.   <br /> <br />It left me feeling that there's so much more to life than work-eat-sleep routine that so many of us get caught up in. <br /> <br />It's very long (900+ pages) but worth every word.
B00001W9G0|5.0|Great love story.  Everytime I watch this movie, I cry.  Robert Redford couldn't have been more handsome than he was in this movie.  And Barbra Streisand is always great in whatever she does.  Strictly a chick flick for a rainy afternoon or a cold evening at home alone.
0385720920|5.0|Imagine you and a group of friends are sitting, reading poems, you decide to go get a drink of water and when you come back all of your friends are dead. This is what the main characters in Choke are researching.  In the book this is referred to as \\"crib-death\\", but is later found to be linked to a certain poem that is read aloud and eventually kills its reader and/or the person listening to the poem.  Palahniuk has, after reading just one of his books, obviously a dim view of mankind as a whole in modern times. He references this in many of his books and this is no exception. He works in very powerful lines and paragraphs that when thought about are part of a bigger story represting the world through a metaphor.  This is not a book for the light-hearted. It is filled with twisted riddle and dark imagry of the world, but what Palahniuk is most known for is his way of working in dark humor. He is even on a list of noted black comedy users under \\"literature\\" on the page for Black Comedy on [...].  Compared to his other novels, Lullaby is by far the least perverse and twisted, but is based nearly solely on death. There is no sex-addicted charaters, or people with schizophrenia or amnesia, but there is a whole lot of dying.  Readers of previous Palahniuk novels will love this book. This is also the best novel for new readers to introduce themselves into the world of palahniuk see that this is the least dark, in my opinion.
1582701709|3.0|The ultimate Lesson of Human Life is this: <br /> <br />               1. To change what we cannot accept <br />               2. To accept what we cannot change <br />               3. TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE  <br /> <br />This book is all about #1.  What happened to #2 and #3?  <br /> <br />Could the community of sales and marketing \\"gurus\\" contributing to this book be making their fortunes by selling a collection of potent words and ideas that stir us into exhuberance? And get credit cards to fly out of purses and pockets?    <br /> <br />Of course. <br /> <br />But that's not a bad thing. Business is business and the sell/buy system is what makes our economy healthy and strong. Everyone wants that!  <br /> <br />Overall, books like these (there are thousands)do more good than harm because they inspire many readers to start thinking, planning and taking actions that can lead to major life changes for good. Changing an unsatisfactory life for good is priceless.   <br /> <br />But passion and purpose can't be forced. Everyone wants a good life but most people don't know what they want, let alone make it happen.  <br /> <br />The REAL SECRET not only inspires us to change what we cannot accept, but  teaches us to accept what we cannot change.  <br /> <br />Having the wisdom to know the difference is worth any price.   <br />
B000E6FSPW|5.0|I think this is one of the best ROCKY soundtracks. The songs sound great and it really captures the feel of the 80s. Despite the absence of regular composer Bill Conti (I wonder why he didn't score this one.) this is one of the better ROCKY albums and composer Vince DiCola's handles the instrumentals proficiently.

B000KZMU30|3.0|Christina Released a great album but the retail price for this vinyl edition is outrageous. 50 bucks because the album is split into 3 discs and has fancy packaging? Sorry but this is a complete waste of money considering that the packaging is made out of cardboard. I'm sorry but save your money and buy the CD
0740748475|5.0|Calvin and Hobbes is a wonderful comic strip, and this set contains all of them.  The books are quite heavy-duty and durable, and they look good too.  If you know someone (or are someone) who doesn't like sarcastic humor or humor that makes you think, then you should check out some Calvin and Hobbes before buying the whole collection.
B000FIMG68|5.0|Lost is the best series my husband and I have watched so far. It is one that you watch on the edge of your chair. <br />Season two was just as good as season one. We are now watching season 3 on TV every week but will buy season three on DVD as soon as it is out. <br />Enjoy!!!
B000G75AE8|4.0|****½ stars.<br /><br />For being 25 years old, the band has somehow managed to sound like the opposite.<br /><br />The album has a lean, mean feel and the music is faster, heavier and more intense and focused than ever. It's a shockwave of pure adrenaline, the first half climaxing with Jihad, and Tom Araya's vocals never sounding more urgent, driving and full of purpose. The frenzied, frenetic pace continues unabated with Dave Lombardo's pulsating pummelings and staccato smashings, Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman's laser quick precision guitars slicing through the songs as slick as a scalpel with Consfearacy, Catatonic, Black Serenade and on down the line. The songs are expertly crafted, some starting slow at the beginning and gradually building in tempo, rising up to a deafening crescendo and blindingly fast pace; others bash you over the head from start to finish. All the the material sounds as tight as you would expect from a band that's been together this long and loves playing together this much. The true hallmark for this album is that Slayer is still a hungry, intense band and haven't lost a trace of their edge. Thank you, Slayer, for such a surgically precise yet bonejarringly buzzsaw heavy, whiplash-inducing, neck-snapping experience. All hail the closest thing to \\"Reign In Blood II\\" that we've seen thus far! All hail Slayer!!!
B00005JOQS|2.0|In a typical fashion today's Hollywood, special effects are used to hide the lack of talents in this aweful movie.  Gone are the charms, humor, romance and acting talents of past \\"Superman.\\"  All we see are mindless explosions and special effects.  What a shame!
B000006NPY|4.0|I had this album but gave it away to a girlfriend at the time because I thought it was too mellow.  Now, 4 years later, I wish I had it back.  Like a couple of reviewers mentioned, it deserves another look after this much time has passed and after the backlash it received upon its debut.  Also the fact that it takes more than just one listen to get into and appreciate.  4 years after I gave it away, I hear some of these songs, realize I like them, and then realize they were on Adore.  This album will definitely be a part of my collection again.
B000AADYYO|4.0|The mighty Opeth return with more hardcore and melodic arrangements that are sure to please their ravenous fans. Most songs pass the eight minute mark with dark and eerie instrumentals, as is the norm for them. Although Opeth sound more melodic than on previous efforts, they still unleash their inner-beasts whenever they please. They're starting to sound a lot like their friends Porcupine Tree.
1932100385|5.0|The information in this book gave me my life back. All the wisdom and knowledge found in this book is written in a way that anyone can understand.  I was diagnosed with cancer in 1993. In 1995 I was given no hope to live from the physicians. I was told by my oncologist that there was no known cure for my kind of cancer. In 1996 I read \\"The China Project\\" a 30 page book written by T. Colin Campbell. The same information is in \\"China Study\\" which is one of the most important books ever written. I ordered the hard back edition because I knew this book will remain in my library.
B000FIMHJ4|3.0|The Good<br /><br />Look What the Cat Dragged In (as well as the other releases) sounds a lot more crisp and clean as I remember it, but still shows how the group was honing their sound. That's not a bad thing, but Poison really blows the roof off these songs today. Sometime you forget that songs like \\"Cry Tough,\\" \\"I Want Action,\\" \\"Talk Dirty to Me,\\" and \\"I Won't Forget You\\" were from their debut album (and that it was 20 years ago!). The bonus track included are 7\\" inch mixes of \\"I Want Action\\" and \\"Cry Tough,\\" as well as an unreleased cut \\"Don't Mess Around with Jim.\\"<br /><br />Open Up and Say...Ahh is where Poison really made their mark. Oddly enough this release didn't spawn as many hits as their debut, but it does contain their most successful track ever \\"Every Rose Has It's Thorn.\\" In addition to that, MTV favorites \\"Nothin' But a Good Time,\\" \\"Fallen Angel,\\" and \\"Your Momma Don't Dance\\" will refresh the memories of your youth. Another notable change is the inclusion of the original album cover. Honestly, it's quite tame even for back then. I even discovered a few long-lost album tracks that were just as good as the singles (\\"Back to the Rocking Horse,\\" \\"Tearin' Down the Walls\\"). Bonus tracks include one song \\"Livin' for the Minute\\" and a 10 minute interview that involves the band talking about themselves and the album (from back then).<br /><br />Anyone that loved Poison's first two albums kind of got a bad taste in their mouth with the release of Flesh and Blood. Once again, not because it was bad, but it was because Poison was starting to drift away from their over-the-top pop-metal sound, to a more gritty and bluesy sound. The most memorable rocking track from this album would be \\"Unskinny Bop,\\" but for the most part, the other hit singles were ballads or borderline ones (\\"Life Goes On,\\" \\"Ride the Wind,\\" \\"Something to Believe In\\"). Bonus tracks include and acoustic version of \\"Something to Believe In\\" and an unreleased instrumental demo of \\"God Save the Queen.\\"<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />Doesn't make much sense on the part of Poison and Capitol to remaster and release these albums within months of releasing an 18 track greatest hits package. Who wants these three albums when you can just have the best songs all on one CD? For the bonus tracks maybe? I doubt it. None of the bonus tracks are anything special. Who the hell cares about 7\\" mixes and an interview? How many times are you going to listen to that? Sure there are a couple of unreleased tracks, but take it from a Poison fan, you can live without them.<br /><br />The Verdict<br /><br />Nice to hear the sound updated, kind-of neat to hear the unreleased stuff, but your better off picking up The Best of Poison: 20 Years of Rock. It has all of the hits and none of the filler (well, except for the new cover songs).en.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />The Bad <br />Doesn't make much sense on the part of Poison and Capitol to remaster and release these albums within months of releasing an 18 track greatest hits package.

B000K7VHQ4|5.0|This film has an all too rare combination of tight scriptwriting, great scenography, intelligent and powerful acting and an understated yet impeccable directing.<br /><br />The atmosphere of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire (re-created, if i read the credits correctly, in Prague) with its officious and fussy officials and confident courtiers convinced of their superiority, with great cities and remote hunting lodges, brings to us an era that even most Europeans have forgotten about. The film plays with contrasts - social contrasts between a lower class upstart, a middle class policeman and aristocrats; 'epistemological' contrasts between positivists, professional magicians and believers in spiritualism; contrasts between romantic passion and status...  and above all, in what is a version of a Clint Eastwood riding into a dusty town,  the ultimately romantic twist of a stranger appearing in Vienna with nothing but a bag of tricks.<br /><br />The plot is tight, with many surprises and I enjoyed every minute of it. It is a smart and suspensful, but also funny and romantic, movie. Recommended.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|If all you've heard of the group are \\"Beast and the Harlot\\" and \\"Bat Country\\" on the radio, then you're missing out nine other killer metal songs. A7X separate themselves from their metal peers with interesting arrangements, a focus on great vocal harmonies, rapid-fire drum work, and driving guitars (which also focus on a lot on melody). I could see Avenge Sevenfold leading the charge for a new breed of American power metal, much like Helloween and others did in Europe.
0060595183|3.0|Huxley is a very erudite individual, and hallucinogenics were novel for the time (1950's). What we can say now is that even well educated and intelligent individuals are not very far from psychotic thinking.
B000ICM5IK|3.0|The Good<br /><br />Ah, that familiar trumpet introduction of \\"Gonna Fly Now (Theme From Rocky).\\" It was enough to pump up underdog Rocky Balboa for his chance at glory against the reigning champ Apollo Creed in the first Rocky, and there's no doubt it pumps you up as well when you channel your inner Rocky. \\"Eye of the Tiger\\" from Rocky III was the quintessential athletic anthem of that time period. It quite possible inspired all sports to incorporate entrance themes. Most notably wrestling and boxing. It put Survivor on the map too, but somehow is looked upon as one of the cheesiest anthems today.<br /><br />Sad but true, but \\"Living in America\\" was my first real introduction to James Brown. His performance in Rocky IV was just as energetic as the song itself. If you have any doubt about how big Survivor became after \\"Eye of the Tiger,\\" they returned for Rocky IV with \\"Burning Heart.\\" First off, how many bands are asked to return with a theme song for a high successful movie franchise? Second, Rocky III & IV were probably the best and most successful ones in the series. Do you remember the theme to Rocky II or V? I've made my point.<br /><br />Rocky IV actually spawned some great AOR music. Robert Tepper's \\"No Easy Way\\" out is a prime example with its powerful pulsing keyboards and emotional vocals. The often overlooked John Cafferty track \\"Heart's on Fire,\\" will get your adrenaline pumping for sure. How can you forget Rocky training rugged in the cold mountains of Russia while he prepared to face the medically engineered Ivan Drago? It was cool to see the Family Guy pay tribute to it in an episode last year.<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />Not that Rocky V was all that great, but only one track is included and it's a Bill Conti instrumental. Speaking of Conti, this album pretty much features his instrumental contributions to the movie series. With the exception of the songs above, who really wants to sit and listen to 11 instrumentals from Rocky on their radio? I guess Three 6 Mafia figured they could follow up their Oscar win with another movie contribution in Rocky Balboa (Rocky VI), but they fail to delivery. I just don't see Rocky as a rap guy anyway, after years of rock anthems. That's probably why the songs from Rocky V aren't here.<br /><br />The Verdict<br /><br />I'm sure everyone has seen at least one Rocky movie in there lifetime (you're not a real man anyway if you haven't seen them all). This latest collection of tracks is great for a trip down memory lane, which in essence is the point behind the latest Rocky Balboa movie. However, with all the movie clips and instrumentals, you probably will only enjoy it for the vocal tracks.s Three 6 Mafia figured they could follow up their Oscar win with another movie contribution in Rocky Balboa (Rocky VI), but they fail to delivery.

B00004T1NA|5.0|Doubt no further.  This album is easily Porcupine Tree's most musically astonishing and listenable album for newcomers.  \\"Lightbulb Sun\\" successfully combines the elements of the classic Porcupine Tree albums with that of their newly adopted mainstream sound.  Coming from a fan of both classic Porcupine Tree and more recent Porcupine Tree, \\"Lightbulb Sun\\" meets all the needs that a music fan could ever hope for, and then some! <br /> <br />The album kicks you off with \\"Lightbulb Sun\\" and what a brilliant way to start off.  Opening with a catchy acoustic line and quickly launching the listener into nostalgia of past Porcupine Tree trademarks: entrancing guitar melodies and melodic piano work.  Along with the more classic Porcupine Tree sound, there is also the new catchy and more mainstream sound Porcupine Tree has adopted through melodic vocal lines. \\"Four Chords That Made a Million,\\" embodies the classic image of psychadelic rock through the strange, yet beautifully distorted guitar riff.  After emerging from the more recognizable aesthetics Porcupine Tree usually exemplifies, \\"Shesmovedon\\" introduces to the listener, just how universally appealing and emotional Porcupine Tree can get, containing a tear-jerking guitar solo.  Another spotlight track, \\"The Rest Will Flow,\\" uses each instrument to its fullest potential; each instrument adds a different layer to the song that builds up to an extremely epic outro.  One more track worth mentioning is the thirteen minute trip \\"Russia on Ice.\\"  This track is easily the most reminicent of the early Porcupine Tree days with soothing ambience and stellar majesty. <br /> <br />This album is easily my most prized Porcupine Tree album.  If you're a fan of beautiful and thought-provoking music, this is the album for you!  And as I mentioned before, this album is Porcupine Tree's paramount piece (I should mention it is VERY closely followed by \\"Stupid Dream\\").  If you are at all considering buying this, I hope I helped convince you. <br /> <br />
B000FFJ85I|2.0|The Good<br /><br />\\"Prelude 12/21\\" is an introduction song that's loaded with tension building drums that lay the ground work for a possible powerful and rebellious album. As the next track begins, any notion of that kind of album is completely shattered.<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />\\"Kill Caustic\\" is quite heavy and \\"Miss Murder\\" relies a lot on melody, but both are so preconceived and rudimentary. It's evident after listening to Decmberunderground that AFI are just another image-driven, disposable modern rock band whose shelf life is slowing running down. Their major problem is that their dark themes and \\"trendy\\" rock image only cater to a small portion of the rock fan collective. That portion being sad, angry, and misunderstood teenagers. On top of that, their musical arrangements are tired and amateurish for a band that has had seven albums.<br /><br />The Verdict<br /><br />Maybe AFI doesn't speak to me because I'm no longer a teenager, but isn't great rock music meant to appeal to the masses? If AFI want to continue after their target audience grows up, they need to do more than what all of the other \\"trendy\\" rock bands are doing. What do I know? I'm just another misunderstood adult.

B000FIHJLK|4.0|Every line-up of the Richie Blackmore group Rainbow had their own special songs and styles, but it was the Ronnie James Dio fronted version that was the most memorable. This album captured the group at their finest. Dio vocals are thunderous and powerful, and Blackmore is equally as divine. Richie hogs the spotlight from time to time with his endulgent fretwork. Although only eight songs are listed on this double CD set, a lot of them are medlies of some of their most memoriable hits.
0375703764|5.0|Mark Z. Danielewski's debut novel House of Leaves opens with the extraordinary admonition, \\"This is not for you\\" (Danielewski ix). This caution initially appears to be a strange tactic by the author designed to deter readers. However, as the story unfolds, as the reader turns page after page, it becomes clear that this epic novel is highly unusual. Danielewski issues his readers with both a warning and a challenge. This book is not for the faint-hearted or escapists among us, but for those who are prepared to negotiate new reading paths, delve beyond the ostensible surface of the page, and actively engage with the text. In his introduction, Truant describes what awaits the reader:<br /><br />Endless snarls of words, sometimes twisting into meaning, sometimes into nothing at all, frequently breaking apart, always branching off into other pieces... each fragment completely covered with the creep of years and years of ink pronouncements; layered, crossed out, amended; handwritten, typed; ...impenetrable, lucid... (Ibid. xvii)<br /><br />In fact, the novel is brimming with typographical and spatial innovation: words placed under erasure, concrete poetry, movie mimicry, the foregrounding of book as physical artefact... It is a rhizomatic novel that in its material form stands as a sister to computer hypertext, offering the reader an intimate textual experience. In an age in which printed books are thought by some to be archaic, House of Leaves challenges the limits of the novel and the printed word. By innovating its spatial dynamics, House of Leaves' proves that books are not becoming obsolute but evolving with us and with our technology. In this, House of Leaves sounds a revolution.

Dr. Sagan was awed by the mystery of the universe and had a deep sense of 'reverence' for its elegance and beauty. He was fond of saying, with respect to 'God' that absense of proof was not proof of absense. I heard him say this a number of times. In some sense the question of a 'ground of being' or a summum bonum may not be observable by any empirical standards. Having said this science can take us to the threshold of this fantastic universe and enable us to peer over the edge a bit. It is truly more miraculous than God himself.    I finished Professor Dawkins \\"The God Delusion\\" about a month ago and have been thinking about it on and off ever since. I will continue to think about the subject. I have always been skeptical of organized religion. Riligion, if we are not careful, can be a cul de sac on the road to human enlightenment and understanding. The final realization that 'God' does not exist was really quite liberating for me. We must understand that no 'supreme' being is looking over our shoulder and those who really understand this can become dedicated to the truth. If indeed human beings have true free will then why would God need to hang around? Free will is either free or it is not. Having a God who intervenes would not really be free...would it?     We must become seekers of the truth not appeasers of imaginary golden calfs. When one reads Dawkins or..say.. Dr. Sagan it becomes evident that leading a worthwhile, interesting and fulfilling life is a reward in and of itself that has absolutely nothing to do with future rewards in another lifetime. It is, after all, this lifetime that is so precious...as is all life. This is a truly courageous way to live. I have to say that in arguing against the existence of 'God', Professor Dawkins is paradoxically arguing for something much greater. Science can take us to the threshold of the greatest of all mysteries whose story is truly more fantastic and awe inspiring than all of the ancient religious mythologies combined. The greatest of all mysteries is right before our eyes and most people cannot see it. All to often religion quashes human curiosity and learning by providing a pat framework of answers that make people feel comfortable. If mankind is really to survive through this period of high technology we have to move beyond the 'commandments' of the religious elite and understand that on Earth, God's work must truly be our own.
1400032717|5.0|I seldom read a book through in one sitting, but I couldn't put this one down, and I immediately purchased gift copies (also rare).
0307237699|5.0|When is the last time a sitting politician inspired you?  Not just impressed you or made you think, but really and truly made you want to get off your butt and do something to make a difference in the world?  I remember the last time that happened to me.  It was in 2004, when Barack Obama spoke at the Democratic National Convention.  For the first time in a long time, maybe the first time ever, I was moved to not only see the possibility of change in the world, but to want to do something to be a part of it.  There is no question, the man has a way with words, and he proves it over and over in \\"The Audacity of Hope.\\"<br /><br />\\"No one is exempt from the call to find common ground.\\"  This is one of many phrases that stood out to me in the book.  Obama has a talent for finding just the right thing to say at just the right moment, and the best  part about that is that one genuinely feels that he means what he says.  In his case, it is not just empty rhetoric said for the benefit of an electorate or a constituency -- it is how he genuinely feels.  And best of all, his worldview is not a pessimistic one.  It reflects the hope he finds in everyday events, the inspiration he finds in everyday people, and the love he has for America and those who live in it.<br /><br />In \\"The Audacity of Hope,\\" Obama covers a wide range of subjects, including some most politicians often shy away from. He spends a good deal of time on the subject of racial issues, talks about America's relationship with the wider world, discusses education and morality and family and faith and the divide between the parties and Constitutional law and even some of the inner workings of being a political figure in the 21st Century.  But this is not just a book about issues or about politics.  Frequently throughout the book, several times in each chapter, Obama explores how his politics relate to his personal life, and vice-versa. Even if one is reading the book just to learn how he feels about abortion or about the war in Iraq, one cannot escape the personality of the man in these pages.  The book is about many issues important on the modern political stage, but the book is also imbued with a sense of the man who wrote it, and is often intensely personal.<br /><br />In the end, Obama didn't write this book to win an election. After reading it, I can truly see that he wrote it because it is a subject he loves, and that love is there the whole way through. He wrote it to convey the hope he has for America and its people, and to suggest -- never demand -- ways to make that hope a reality. His ideas are intelligent and well-stated, and he has clearly put a lot of thought into what he says.  I, for one, appreciate a political figure who takes care with his words and who has the courage to be honest about his ideas and his feelings.<br /><br />\\"No one is exempt from the call to find common ground.\\"  It bears repeating, because it strikes me that this is a message central to this book as a whole. No citizen of the United States, or even of the world, can absolve themselves of the responsibility to work with each other, to be better than we have been.  It is a part of what we owe each other, and it is the hope that Barack Obama dares to express that we can be a part of that change.<br /><br />I have to say, it sure does feel good to be inspired by a politician for once.  For this reason alone, I am glad I read \\"The Audacity of Hope.\\"r about the war in Iraq, one cannot escape the personality of the man in these pages.  The book is about many issues important on the modern political stage, but the book is also imbued with a sense of the man who wrote it, and is often intensely personal. <br /> <br />In the end, Obama didn't write this book to win an election.

B00001OH7X|5.0|This is the last of 3 albums Bowie did with Eno (his \\"Berlin\\" period, although this one was not recorded in Berlin.  This is my favorite one of the three, and possibly my favorite Bowie album period.  This one has no instrumental pieces, like on \\"Low\\" and \\"Heroes\\".  The first half of the album has a vague \\"travel\\" theme to it.  In several songs Bowie mixes in bits of African drumming or arabesque sounding string synthesizer sounds.  These are all rock or pop songs, but they are all \\"deconstructed\\" pop songs, because everything from the instrument sounds to the songs' construction is turned on its head, at least that's how it seemed in 1979.  This album features Adrian Belew on guitar making sounds that were basically unheard of at the time.  \\"DJ\\" and \\"Boys..\\" are highlights - absolutely brilliant, and Belew truly uses his guitar like a weapon on his solos.  The only really weak song is \\"Red Money\\", which is the music from Iggy Pop's \\"Sister Midnight\\" set to different (inferior) lyrics.  Fortunately it's at the end, so it's easy to skip that tune, but the rest is highly recommended.
B000FJGWBM|4.0|If you like the pulp fiction style of jumping around alot and not being able to predict the ending, then you'll like this movie.  Also, I thought it was one of the better quality Blu-Ray transfers that I've seen so far.
1582701709|1.0|The premise is simple. Think good thoughts, motivate yourself and stay motivated.  The downside it the individualistic, anti-spiritual isolation you will experience.
B0002YJ29O|5.0|Its, a very good video, the sound its great, well, the concert its amazing
B00003CXPJ|5.0|Much better than I expected and gets better with repeated viewings.  Whether or not someone likes this movie depends on whether they get into the jokes that underly the surface jokes.  This movie has excellent production values and shows that a lot of time went into crafting the story.  Will Ferrell's delivery of my review title is almost worth the price alone.
1402720602|5.0|This book is sure to please the most discriminating maker of guitars. The photos of all the  different phases of guitarmaking are clearly explained with a multitude  of colored photos. The language is clear and concise. The illustrations and  color photos speak for themselves, of the many varied operations involved in guitar making. My only problem was figuring out how to make a 15ft and 25 ft radius jigs.Of all the 12 books I own on guitarmaking. This book, in my opinion, is the most comprehensive in detailing , every  aspect of this demanding and rewarding craft. My hats off to Mr. bogdanovich for an excellent job.
B000002L9W|4.0|Remember the beginning of the music vid for Yankee Rose? Yeah...takin u back, eh?turn back the clock to November 14 1986, DLR sold out two shows at the Hollywood Sportatorium. It was my second concert ever attended (don't recall whether i went to the first show on November 14 or the 2nd show at the same venue on the 15th) Anyway DLR's band, imo, was BETTER that his old Van Halen cronies: Steve Vai on guitar, Greg Bissonette on the drums, and the great Billy Sheehan on the bass. Most of the album has dated well for what it is. Good songs are : Goin Crazy, Shy Boy, Ladies Night In Buffalo, Big Trouble, i even like Roth's Sinatra cover, That's Life.
B000001FOS|5.0|Sure this is much more commercial than Marching Out, but several other reviewers fail to note that 'Trilogy' was very keyboard oriented and bridged the gap between 'Marching Out' and 'Odyssey'. Yngwie was changing his sound to fit the times and cranked out one serious masterpiece! <br /> <br />Joe Lynn Turner sounds absolutely amazing and Yngwie's playing is flawless. These are some excellent, hook-laden melodic rock tunes that need to be heard. I should also mention that the production on this album was heads and shoulders above the previous 3 albums!
0446613444|4.0|The Black Ice is a good, solid police thriller.  Connelly writes convincingly of the inside machinations of the police force and the story line is believable.  I like that his characters have `character flaws' and the good guys are not all good.  His tough guy, always bordering on getting canned protagonist, Harry Bosch, is as rough and tumble, smart, and raw as they come.  Bring on more Harry!  I'm ready for the next in the series.
1881273156|5.0|Great book that possesses a tremendous message.  The condition of the book was superb. <br />The book itself is one that can be applied to so man different areas of your life.  It is a great inventory of yourself to understand what it is that you need in life, and what it is that others may need from you. <br />I received this book as a wedding gift.  My wife and I loved it.  It helped us out so much.  We purchased the book for others, including my father in law.  This book is worth it.  Buy it and you will be thrilled that you did.  It will not fix everything in your life, but it will help you think about it and empower you. <br />Enjoy
B000ICL3KG|5.0|For Republicans, yes Al Gore's voice may annoy you...but it's OK, he lost in 2000 didn't he?  For Democrats, you'll love every minute.   <br /> <br />I bought this because of one question: How does a former VP present such a controversial topic in a hollywood movie?   <br /> <br />Gore did great.  It's no Armagaeddon, and his presentation in real life is obviously longer, and more extensive of the critiques to global warming, but he recognizes the limited attention span of the public and carefully chooses the evidence that provides no doubt to the discussion of global warming.   <br /> <br />Some clips of Gore's personal life appear.  He was against it b/c like any  average person you would look selfish and ruin the credibility of the movie's message.  However, it was the director that said it was critical for an effective story.  So don't worry about it.   <br /> <br />I used this for a leadership workshop in UC Davis.  THE BEST PART is Gore's interest in NOT presenting numbers BUT RATHER EXPLAINING THE PROCESS, AS INDIVIDUALS, TO LET THE WORLD WORK AND THINK IN A BETTER WAY.  It's entertaining, unique, and a rare opportunity to watch a public figure direct his passion into a wonderful movie!
B000002L7R|3.0|Bought this remastered ($7US).  This album for me yielded two tunes:<br /><br />1. Raspberry Beret (good song...weak video)<br /><br />2. Pop Life (an interesting song, if I do say so...)<br /><br />Still, this is Prince.  No one could really match the body of work that the man had put out up until this disc.  Three stars!!
1582701709|1.0|My son has a book call \\"My Personal Penguin\\" and for such a short book it says \\"Person Penguin\\" all over the book. The idea is to brand the plush toy and other books and not to entertain and educate my child. This book repeats \\"the secret\\" sooooo mannnnnnnnnnnnnny times it like a nazi brainwash.  <br /> <br />Reading this book and I did was like having a conversation with someone with multiple personalities. Rhonda Byrne would like a couple paragraphs with the words \\"the secret\\" in everyone and then a quote or comment by some excellent people.  <br /> <br />I purchased the book because of Oprah recommendation and also because Jack Canfield two people that I greatly respect had something to do with the book. Oprah  promoted, and Jack was interviewed.  <br /> <br />But the idea of the book is good but there are many people that have done a better job with the so called secret. Lou Tice of the Pacific Institute wrote Smart Talk and he covers the topic better than anyone else, excellent book. Brian Tracy has covered the topic in several books and tapes and just about anything he puts out is excellent, Napoleon Hill classic Think and Grow Rich covers the topic and then you have the greatest book of all Earl Nightengale,s The Essence of Success.  <br /> <br />I purchased the book, I highlighted nothing and sold it on Amazon. I would not pick this book up if it was in a dollar bargain bin.  <br /> <br />One star only because Jack Canfield is evolved. Read his The Success Principles instead. You will be healthier, wealthier and wiser.  <br />
B000002KLP|3.0|This was another of the re-mastered Prince albums that I bought for ($7US).  The signature song on this disc:  Head!  Overall though, it was my least favorite albums due to his subject matter.  Let's be frank, he left nothing out on this one, and set a standard for all others to follow.  Three stars!!
074356619X|5.0|This is for the 4 CD extended version.   I already owned the DVD version of the Secret,   but I was so impressed with it's possibilities that I wanted to immerse myself in it's teachings.   Most people need to repetition to change the way they think   and so I bought the Extended CD Audio version to wake me up in the morning and to play in my car on the way to work.   The DVD, and especially the extended CD are the best investments I've ever made for my future.   I think if you habituate The Law of Attraction way of thinking, as described in this series   you can effect Happiness, Relationships, Wealth, Health and even your weight.  I recommend this to everyone who is searching for answers and would like to improve their future.     Spirit Rhythms
0743298020|3.0|I'm not quite sure what it was about this book that caused me not to enjoy it as much as I thought it would.  It's got all the right things to make a great gothic novel, the old house, the ghost, the crazy relatives, but somehow it didn't quite come together.  I found the end kind of confusing, though it was a happy ending, it didn't seem like a complete one as I wasn't sure what really happened.  I won't say what exactly as I don't want to give away the end as I hate it when other people do that in the reviews.  It isn't a bad book by any means, I guess I was excepting something else.  By all the great reviews it has gotten I may be one of the few who didn't care for it all that much.  Read it and decide for yourself.
B000EGDC14|5.0|This deluxe edition worth every penny. Great 5.1 mix with photos, videos and live footages. Erotic pulsing beats, very catchy certainly not \\"Pop\\" or mainstream. Interesting and underwhelming record.
B000063DIR|1.0|This 2002 remaster is an abomination to the memory of Randy Rhoads as well as the HUGE contributions of Bob Daisley (bass) and Lee Kerslake (drums).<br /><br />Sharon had the bass and drum parts re-recorded by Robert Truijillo and Mike Bordin respectively for this 2002 remaster to try to get out of paying Bob and Lee performance royalties that they are rightfully owed.<br /><br />To make a short point, buy the 1995 remasters instead of both Diary and Blizzard instead. Those are the ORIGINAL versions of these albums with Bob and Lee's amazing rhythm section work intact as well as the original tone of Randy's still amazing guitar work.  (Has it really been almost 25 years since his death?  R.I.P. Randy).
B000FZESY4|5.0|The prog/death masters are back. This record is amazing, by this time you'll know that and this special edition is a perfect celebration for the best metal record of 2005. Excellent 5.1 mix and the documental is great, more than forty minutes inside the creation of the record an interesting interviews.<br /><br />The cover of Deep Purple is fantastic, excellent choice for a band that's open minded and with no limitations, great feeling.<br /><br />Ghost Reveries is one of the best experiences you can find in music out there.
B00003CXAT|5.0|The biggest attraction of this film back in 1993, of course, was the realistic computer graphic animation of the dinosaurs by SGI coupled with the realistic sound effects and the good use of suspense built around them both. After I first saw this movie in the theatre 14 years ago, I laid in bed awake for hours, not from fright, but from the lingering excitement of the entire experience. Up to that time, nothing like it had ever been done on that scale. This is hard to remember when the Discovery Channel now has the whole \\"Walking with ...\\" series of documentaries on dinosaurs, early man, and creatures before the dinosaur that use the same techniques that this film did, and thus people have become accustomed to this level of realism in animation. Thus with the \\"shock value\\" of the animation removed, this movie doesn't seem quite as \\"5-star\\" as it did during its first run. The dialogue, in particular, seems a bit thin now. One aspect of the movie that still impresses me that doesn't get much mention is the outstanding use of sound and sound effects. For example, when the T-Rex first appears in the movie, it is not just the sight of the thing that terrifies, but its tremendous roar. It is still great action adventure viewing for the entire family, and the 50-minute documentary \\"The Making of Jurassic Park\\" was very interesting too. James Earl Jones narrates this extra feature in which the special effects are given particular attention and examination. The documentary also includes interviews with Steven Spielberg and Michael Crichton. There is also a \\"Dinosaur Encyclopedia\\" with several pages of information on every dinosaur that appeared in the film. Besides that, there are two or three other very short features on how particular scenes in the film were done. The best of these short features is \\"Raptors in the Kitchen\\", which, of course, talks about how the scene with the raptors stalking the children in the kitchen was done. Highly recommended.
B00005JLD4|5.0|With so many reviews posted, I'm reluctant to add one more, but I do want to add my voice to the cheering section.  I ordered this DVD after seeing the video several times.  I just want to keep it in my collection with the current technology.  I've also watched The Tracker, another great movie that stars one of the main characters in Rabbit Proof.  With Rabbit Proof, I cry in the same place each time (and I'm no cry-baby).  But the movie is educational... and you'd have to be in mental coma not to be moved by it.  I am so inspired by it, that Australia is the destination of my next foreign trip.
B000000YNZ|5.0|One of the greatest pleasures of music is listening to it with someone special who shares your musical tastes and at the same time appreciating the beauty and charms music has to offer, like for instance, this lovely album \\"Moon Beams\\" from Bill Evans Trio. It consists of some of Bill Evans greatest recordings with Chuck Israels on bass and Paul Motian on drums.<br /><br />\\"Less is more\\" applies to this album of eight remarkable tunes, two of which are his very own compositions, \\"Re: Person I Knew\\" and \\"Very Early.\\" My favorites include \\"Polka Dots And Moonbeams,\\" \\"It Might As Well Be Spring,\\" and \\"Stairway To The Stars.\\" These are masterpieces of style, elegance and beauty.<br /><br />Listening to this lovely album creates an atmosphere of coziness and you'll surely fall in love with Bill Evans' tastefully exquisite piano playing style.<br /><br />With my heartfelt recommendation for your listening pleasure always and ever!
1400079179|1.0|The 'historical research' on which this nonsense is based could have been done by anyone with half an hour to spare and a good internet connection. In spite of the note at the beginning making claims to historical precision, the book is full of descriptive errors and historical inaccuracy. For example, the secret society described in the novel, the Priory of Sion, was in fact a complete hoax which was invented in the late 1950s by the famous confidence trickster Pierre Plantard, and not dating from 1099 as Brown wants us to believe. Don't bother wth this. It truly is rot.<br /><br />[...]
B00005JO9J|5.0|Item was great - arrived quickly and in perfect condition and was a very reasonable price.
B00001NTXN|5.0|I bought this for my 8 year old son's birthday, and it is incredibly fun.  it encourages strategic forethought and is simple to learn as there are only a few rules.  My 5 year old daughter loves it also, and my husband and I play it without them sometimes!
