0882709194|1.0|This book rates a 0 (zero) star.  The author is promoting his religious (theoretical) conservative beliefs.  This is faith.  It can not be mixed with science.  Science consists of facts and findings which are on-going.  The author clearly does not understand science - except perhaps at the level of 'the earth is flat.'  Especially abhorrent is his comparison of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam with Christianity in relation to his proselytizing.  Please Amazon, consider carrying higher quality books in your inventory.
078513915X|5.0|When a much-loved novel such as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is translated into another, more visual medium, the devoted Jane Austen fan cannot help but be nervous at the potential for mixed results.  The storyline, with its superb dialogue, is apt to be pruned and compressed, while readers may be reluctant to accept another's visualization of their favorite characters.<br /><br />This reviewer thinks Marvel Comic's adaption of \\"P&P\\" can fairly be called a success.  Writer Nancy Butler and artist Hugo Petrus capture the essentials of Miss Jane Austen's classic romance in graphic novel format.  Inevitably, the storyline has been compressed, and the dialogue was been slightly modernized, but fans should have no problem recognizing the story of the Bennets, the Bingleys, and Mr. Darcy.  The best of the dialogue has been preserved while those readers familar with the 1995 BBC TV presentation or the 2005 movie version will recognize a somewhat similar visual presentation.<br /><br />\\"Pride & Prejudice\\" the graphic novel is very highly recommended to those Jane Austen fans looking for a way to introduce their digital-age children or grandchildren to a classic romance novel in a form that is apt to hold their attention, and perhaps motivate them to read the original.
0316010669|5.0|\\"Blink,\\" one in a series of excellent books by Malcolm Gladwell, is one of those rare publications that actually makes you think about how you think.  This concept, covered in an engaging and entertaining voice by Gladwell, may seem confusing, strange, boring, or all of the above at first glance.  Rest assured -- this book is anything but boring, strange, or confusing -- it is a wonderful publication that entertains and teaches in equal measure.<br /><br />With a rhetorical style akin to that conveyed by Michael Pollen in [[ASIN:0143114964 In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto]], Gladwell presents readers with data and hypotheses.  He carefully and logically supports his conclusion(s), but does not force his perspective on his readers.  Gladwell's style, rather, is one of engaging and involving the reader on a journey of learning.<br /><br />For the interested reader, Gladwell offers stories and characters that engage, and ideas and perspectives that stimulate thought.  This is a wonderful book that is well worth a read.

There they try to convince him to return from his retirement to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft to take the Potions Classes. Dumbledore is teaching Harry Potter about Tom Riddle a.k.a.

I have all the Harry Potter movies, and have enjoyed all of them, this one will be no different.

B001AVCFK6|4.0|REVIEW FOR THE BLU-RAY:<br /><br />This isn't your father's \\"Star Trek\\". For good or bad, rebooting a franchise often means reinventing it and J.J. Abrams does a terrific job establishing this alternate \\"Trek\\" universe in \\"Star Trek\\". \\"Trek\\" rises from the ashes of the last \\"Trek\\" film \\"Star Trek:Nemesis\\" and became both a critical and box office success breaking the record for the most profitable \\"Trek\\" film. Be prepared for familair characters behaving...a bit differently in Abrams take on \\"Trek\\".<br /><br />EXTRAS-we get some good ones in this set.<br /><br />We get a commentary track featuring J.J. Abrams, Damon Lindel (producer), Orci & Kurtzman that focus on everything from discarded plot elements to happy accidents that made it into the filming.<br /><br />The deleted scenes aren't all finished; for example two involving Nero's ship and another one involving Sarek returning home have unfinished CGI work. The bulk of the rest of the scenes are pretty well finished. We get an extended scene of Sarek and young Spock as well and finally find out how (at least this Kirk)reprogrammed the Kobyashi Maru simulation in the deleted scenes. In the finished film we're not told how he did it. A nice touch in the film is that Pine as Kirk eats an apple as he takes the test just as he did in when describing it in one scene of \\"Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan\\".<br /><br />We also get featurettes on \\"Aliens\\", \\"Costume Design\\", \\"Ships\\" (including some discarded concepts for the Enterprise), a featurette on Gene Roddenberry's Vision and plenty of interviews with cast and crew discussing tackling the new \\"Trek\\".<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks exceptionally good. Those lens flares that you see were intentional as Abrams is fond of using them to give the film a sense of \\"reality\\".<br /><br />The plot if you're interested--Nero (Eric Bana) an anguished Romulan captain of a mining ship gets sucked into a black hole taking him into the past. After the destruction of Romulus from a natural disaster, Nero wants revenge against Ambassador Spock (Leonoard Nimoy) who he holds responsible. Cadet James T. Kirk (Chris Pine)plans on stopping him. In this \\"alternate\\" glimpseinto the Academy years we see how Spock (Zachary Quinto), Kirk(Chris Pine) and McCoy (Karl Urban)meet, the obstacles including a lack of trust between Spock and Kirk that they must face to defeat Nero before he destroys Earth.ador Spock (Leonoard Nimoy) who he holds responsible.

B0000C1HLF|5.0|The Angels--Natalie, Dylan, and Alex are back again but this time they're preparing for a strike without even warning as they go undercover to retrieve two missing silver bands. These are no ordinary rings. They contain valuable encrypted information that reveal the new identities of every person in the Federal Witness Protection Program. When witnesses start turning up dead, only the Angels, using their expertise as masters of disguise, espionage and martial arts can stop the perpetrator, a mysterious \\"fallen\\" Angel. Aided by their trusty colleague, Jimmy Bosley, the Angels' adventure begins at a remote Mongolian outpost and ends only after Dylan is forced to face a dark secret from her past a secret that puts the lives of her two best friends in danger.

0765348276|5.0|When I started reading this book, I was thinking \\"Another mil-sci-fi book. Gee, not much tech stuff in it... it could have well been written in the 80's\\".    Guess what? It was not needed. It has the right amount of tech in it. And much more. Guess what? It's not just another mil-sci-fi book.    I will not spoil you with the plot. Let's only say it's deeply humane, emotional, and presented excellently. The characters differentiate, and develop. Action is well given, military life shown from a fresh perspective, and a new, very plausible hostile universe has just sprung to life from this first book. A universe where I am sure many readers are and will be spending countless hours of satisfied reading.    Very well done, Mr. Scalzi.    On to the next installment of the series.

0882709194|1.0|Darwin's \\"Origin of Species\\" is one of the greatest and most important books ever written, and should be read and understood by everyone. Sadly, this seemingly cheap edition buys you an abridged copy (missing Darwin's introduction and glossary, as others have observed) with an awful introduction by a Young Earth creationist, Ray Comfort. Young Earth creationism, mind you, is the belief that the earth has existed for only about 6000 years. This is akin to, say, Christopher Hitchens writing a \\"Special Introduction\\" to the Bible, and then printing and selling it as simply \\"The Holy Bible\\"    I was handed this for free as part of a creationist campaign on my university campus. Not knowing who Ray Comfort was (by name, at least), I was really excited by the thought that someone out there would be providing free editions of Darwin to students. A few pages into the introduction it became clear that educating the people about evolutionary theory was not the goal of these fools. Take, for example, the following quote from the introduction:    \\"As evidence that Darwin's theory is correct...we would expect to find something [in the fossil record] that is half monkey, half man.\\"    This is a laughably wrong interpretation of Darwin's theory, and it is far from the most egregious case Comfort presents us. He links evolution and Darwin to Hitler's views on the races, calls Darwin and Huxley racists, harps on Social Darwinism (which has nothing to do with Darwin as a man or proper evolutionary theory), and then proceeds to a heavy-handed, Bible-quoting attempt to convert readers.    The text of \\"Origin\\"--minus the introductions, glossary, index, etc.--is printed in type that makes newspaper classified pages look readable. It was clearly intended to deter individuals from actually reading Darwin (not a hard feat with 19th century scientific prose), while the \\"Special Introduction\\" is printed in nice, large, easily viewable type.     Creationists are a burden on this nation. They have no right to complain about America's decline in the sciences and technology, for they are a major part of the cause. When only 39% of Americans accept the fact of evolution--NOT \\"believe in evolution,\\" because it's not a matter of faith--and several states require creationism to be taught alongside science, it is no wonder our students perform terribly in the sciences. This edition will no doubt help fuel that.

The result is very poor and this may be part of the reason it was not more widely distributed.\\"    If one is really interested in \\"Mein Kampf,\\" this translation may be of marginal interest.  However, since it never had significant distribution, and since in the publisher's own words the translation is poor, why would the average person interested in what Hitler had to say buy this translation?  Go with Ralph Manheim's translation, the one most scholars use.
0385504225|2.0|This had the same feeling as the Da Vinci Code, the way it was written and the way the story was structured. It felt like I was reading the same book, like it he took the cookie cutter mold of Da Vinci Code and just cranked out another book, only this one had an ending that I thought was very disappointing, especially given all of the build-up. I was expecting something pretty amazing and at the end I just felt \\"THAT was it??!!\\". 2 stars just for the effort, I guess. Not worth buying, though. If you read the Da Vinci Code and liked it then just pass on this one. Disappointed for sure! Though it did make me want to visit Washington DC. If they could take whatever facts about the city are true and put it into a booklet, that'd be cool to take on a vacation to DC.

B001KVZ6G6|1.0|Beautiful movie. Typically Pixar. I actually went to a cinema to see it (which, here in Germany, is usually getting too expensive for my taste), and didn't regret it at all.  Bought the DVD as soon as it came out - yes, actually thought the movie good enough that I want to see it again on DVD, despite it not being particularly cheap.    And the DVD doesn't play, thanks to some DRM (Digital Restriction Mess-Up). It doesn't play, because it does not adhere to the DVD standard, thus (by definition) not being a DVD. So I paid a LOT of money - to get nothing.    Thanks. Disney. Well done. Wish I could give you Zero Stars.   Certainly an excellent way of making sure I buy even less DVDs than I already do, and certainly none ever again from *you*.
B002VL2PTU|5.0|This is the King of Pop at his best.  It is an amazing window into Michael's rehersals for his never to be performed 50 concerts in London.  But it is not just about the music, song and dance.  Michael's sensitivity, love, and caring self is manifested through the entire film. His lyrics and videos communicate his awareness of our world's problems, and his passion to heal our world is a recurring theme. This is an opportunity for those who do not know Michael, to see the real Michael; the Michael his fans know and love.<br />The King of Pop performs all of his fans' favorite songs. The only disappointment is that it leaves one wanting more. MJ fans will cherish this glimpse of Michael's last creative effort.  It is just difficult to digest that this is indeed his \\"final curtin call.\\"

0061134007|5.0|Extra Information : The first two books for this Harry Hole series The Bat Man and The Cockroaches have not been produced for translation at this time. The Redbreast would be the third book in this series; if you were to start this series my recommendation would be from The Redbreast. The series then follows through in order with [[ASIN:0061655511 Nemesis: A Novel (Harry Hole)]], [[ASIN:0099478536 The Devil's Star]] and finally [[ASIN:B001V7V8GG The Redeemer (A Harry Hole Mystery)]] which will then bring everyone up to date for the release of [[ASIN:0307358658 The Snowman]] March 2010.      Review - The Redbreast    The Redbreast is a wonderful complex, tightly constructed novel; shifting between history and a contemporary modern day crime plot. The Author Jo Nesbø brings us into his Oslo and story during late 1999. Detective Harry Hole and work partner Ellen Gjelten have been given a routine security assignment but it doesn't take long for a communication break down and all to go horribly wrong. Over at police HQ a decision from the seniors are quickly made to promote Harry to the rank of inspector, a promotion combined with a move to a screened operation in POT, also known as getting him out of the way and cover up any police blunders. Harry's new assignment is to monitor neo-Nazi activities; he soon discovers a high-calibre rifle has been smuggled into the country, a favourite weapon for any assassin.     The second story is the heart of where this tale starts World War II, 1942 this plot is constantly moving itself forward through the war. Norwegian soldiers many without any initial training were sent to the front, they thought they were fighting for their country but the realization was very different they were fighting a losing battle for Hitler on the Eastern front. The Russians were gaining ground and survival was simply taken a day at a time, fear became every soldiers best friend. Many deserted or became prisoners of war others joined the Norwegian Resistance. War with its deepest psychology, one man's darkness will never end, wanting his own justice severed.     I first read this book in 2007 it was suspenseful and gripping then, the second time around was very much the same but strangely enough my re-read was around Remembrance Day just gone, which was nothing more than a coincidence but it did make this book more thought provoking. Jo Nesbø based parts of this book on his own family stories from WWII this I feel is a wonderful tribute to his own parents. Personal family stories from any war are the ones normally told quite differently from our history books, so his own family stories makes this whole storyline very intriguing to read. The Author gives us a clear outline of Norwegian life, different perspectives, outcomes, it covers quite a lot of views, choices and actions during and after the war; actions that shows peoples future fate. Two sides, one outcome, both sides looking to win, for some it will never end, anti-Stalinist on one side and Norwegian Resistance on the other, characters share stories and tragedies while everything remains on a conclusion course for the final dark modern day twisted finish. The author builds suspense and tension throughout, incredibly descriptive with some real heartbreaking moments too.     Brilliant characterization, clear insight, observation and mannerism of people it's all quite uncanny. If you're reading about Harry Hole for the first time, expect a loner, an alcoholic full of cynicism but he remains likeable, when his job bears too much evil it keeps him from staying on the wagon. Another reason to start here you will also meet quite a few other characters in this book that continue through the series, especially on his love life as it starts to flourish in this one.     It's the little things: The humour in Jo Nesbø novels never escapes my notice, it translates into an English dry sense of humour and it works well with everything else going on. Something else I've noticed about this authors writing his very descriptive, he pays great attention to detail, however small, for this book it's anything from a mechanical hitch in Harry's run down old Escort (most of us have all been there, trying to get the car to start on a cold morning alone, hoping it might just turn over the first time) or just the simple things that happen in every day life to make realness and imagination connect. Thoroughly enjoyed this authors work and with the history, mystery, twists combined he never missed his mark, highly recommend, great book for any evening, especially a winters one.     Also adding here a thank you to Don Bartlett for the clear translation in the series.     Andrea Bowhill

Their presentation is either boring, too brief, without much explanation, lack of proper example or simply too difficult to read. That book is totally different.

Highly recommend. No need to think, buy it!!!
B0015DROBO|5.0|Downloaded the Kindle Book on a whim, after seeing it all over the airport bookstores.  The first chapter was slow building with Swedish references, which were a little difficult to follow.  A wiki overview of Sweden made the story much more interesting for me.  After the first chapter I was hooked and could not put the book down.<br /><br />The story was fresh, with unexpected twists and a tough as nails heroine who keeps the male characters on their toes.  Can't wait to read the next book.

B002OEBMN4|4.0|We all know the resume of this band.  I think all Slayer cds are great, for the time period they were released and circumstances surrounding each cd.  I prefer more of the 80's/early 90's Slayer though.  I also felt Christ Illusion was one of the best cds they have put out and had a great production and alot of oomph to the songs.  I find the oomph lacking in this release.   First of all this is 100% Slayer, don't get me wrong, been listening to them since they first started out and have seen them multiple times live.  The solos are fantastic, Lombardo's drummming is off the hook and Araya really sounds great on this release.  I also love the atmosphere to some of the songs, like Human Strain.  But the producer greg Fidelman makes this a less powerful sounding release than it should be.  I don't think he understands metal, or thrash for that matter.  I thought the production on Metallica's Death Magnetic last yr was quite decent.  Guitars were up front and the drumming was light yrs better sounding than St. Anger.  So he did a decent job last yr, but w/Slayer he screwed things up.  Now I have  excellent stereo equipment, so it has nothing to do w/not listening to this on a good system.  Frankly those are usually weak arguments.  If it's a good recording it will sound good on anything.  First problem on this is the guitar sound is flat and weak.   If you listen to Psycopathy Red (great song), the guitars sound amazing, as does the other instruments.  Problem is and a very big glaring problem, the producer used the production/mix from this song that was released as a single many months ago.  Why they did not mix the other songs this way, I have no idea.  It is very glaring when listening to the rest of the cd, that has a different mix.  Another problem is Public Display of Dismemberment.   Song has blast beats, my brother in law did not know the tune had blasts until I told him to listen more closely, the mix on this song is dreadful.  The drum beats are back in the mix and do not come through.  A shame, since this is one of the best songs on the cd.  I also found some of the riffs just not as good as past releases.  But this still is 100% Slayer and better than any of the Bostaph releases, for sure.  On a side note, w/these last 2 releases Slayer still won't give credit for death metal for influencing them to use blast beats and I am kind of sick of them constantly bashing death metal bands.  Last I checked Nile's latest release and same with Man Must Die had a shoestring production budget compared to this, yet sound light yrs better.
B002K0WBXW|4.0|This was a good, cute, funny movie. Typical of Bullock at her cute, funny best.  Of course the story is formulaic and there are no surprises, but if you let yourself just enjoy the movie I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.  Lots of really quirky/funny scenes. You know no one could ever be that uptight or actually have to escape eagles, but Bullock definitely pulls it off. However the big scene stealer was Betty White - an absolute comedic gem! I'm really glad Ms. White is back in the spotlight (an episode of 30 Rock this season, a voice-over in Ponyo, etc).
0316166685|3.0|I became interested in this book after I saw the trailer for the forthcoming movie.  I knew that it was kind of a \\"chick\\" book going in, but I was interested in it anyway.

The book presents a nice way to look at heaven and was enjoyable to read, but the ending spoiled it for me.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|...Look... This is Star Trek.<br />This Is bold, original, and exactly what we needed as fans. It has Sexuality and Emotion.<br />It Has Hot Green skinned women, and People dieing during the birth of children. It Has Romulans, and More emotion. It Has Spock dealing with his emotion while exploring his sexuality. And then there's Scotty, feeling alienated and alone with his litle friend, exploring his sexuality and emotion. And his constant hunger that never dies.<br />I was skeptic to begin with, and when I heard JJ Abrahms was directing it, I thought o.k. it could be good. His Seires \\"LOST\\" deals alot with Emotion, and Jack and Sawyer's personal sexuality for Kate. and above all else emotion.<br />Star Trek has had enough long winded, preachy, movies dealing with issues of society, but we needed something that was over the top, nonstop action, just so we could fall in love with the original characters all over again. (Falling in love deals with both Sexuality and Emotion)<br />Even Majel Barret said before she died that Gene Roddenberry would have loved this, just because it was action packed. He knew what people liked. (and they shared both of these things TOGETHER!)<br />I love this movie, it makes me feel good to be a star trek fan again.<br />Bring your Family and friends and let the the human exploration begin, the future is here and begins now with the greatest Star Trek Movie ever designed by man, with the exception of Star Trek: The Wrath of KHAN!!!! KHAN!!!! (another movie with lots of emotion)<br />Gene Roddenberry would love this movie for all the reasons I mentioned. SEXUALITY & EMOTION!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I was cynical when I followed a friends strong advice to see \\"Phantom\\" on Broadway.  TTurns out; this is one of the best events I've ever witnessed!  I brought my family including my college age kids best friends.  We saw Howard McGillam as the Phantom. He was incredibly powerfull!  I was so moved I then brought my parents.  The play was even better on the second take.  I've recently read the book, and have seen the movie once.  The movie is excellent!  The play is excellent, also!  It's obvious that the movie scipt has more depth than play.  I'd recommend that anybody buy this movie, see the play, and read the book.  The most talented composers, screenwriters and author of the last century bring to us an unbelievably wonderful work of art.  See the movie, go to the play, read the book!    Seeing the play on Broadway is like one of 7 greatest things you can do!  The Majestic Theater was remodeled in 1985 just for this production.
B001FB55I0|2.0|This movie sucks! The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the great special effects. Extremely bad acting, HELLO......Christian Bale, need I say more? Extremely stupid ending too! My God, who approved this script? They should be castrated!And who ever thought Bale would be good as John Connor? He sucks in everything else, but I had high hopes for this movie and just like everything else with him in it, it blows. If you just have to see it to complete the series, rent it from red box so you only waste a buck. If you suffer from insomnia, it is better for you than sleeping pills.

B002P4VUMQ|5.0|The second official full length concert recording from Jason Mraz, Beautiful Mess is an apt demonstration of his continued growth as an artist and performer.  Recorded during the Gratitude Cafe Tour, this CD/DVD set is well suited for new fans and old hats alike.    The setlist, while unsurprisingly heavy on We Sing, We Dance, We Steal things, is well chosen and does a solid job of showcasing Mraz's sound of late and the tour the show was part of.  \\"The Remedy\\" gets a new Reggae-style arrangement, \\"Make it Mine\\" is accompanied by long-time tour intro, and fan-favorite, \\"Traveler\\" and \\"Coyotes\\" reaches it's full potential as a surprisingly rockin' live jam.  The two new tunes, \\"Sunshine Song\\" (previously known as \\"Ray of Sunshine\\") and \\"Anything You Want\\", also offer a promising look at what's to come.  There's no pleasing everyone and quibbling over setlist selection is unavoidable but overall I think the set included on Beautiful Mess gets the job done.  Although, attendees of the Chicago show will want to take note that half a dozen songs performed the night of the recording didn't make the final cut.  Lionel Richie's \\"All Night Long\\" and a cover of the Bushwalla tune \\"Fall Through Glass\\", which became signatures of the tour are, however, welcome additions.  As is the solo performance of \\"The Boy's Gone\\" which features Mraz playing to an empty Charter One Pavilion the night before the show was recorded.    Mraz's vocals are characteristically strong and his band top notch.  The Grooveline Horns are featured prominently with multiple solos and their own interlude \\"Copchase\\".  With keyboards, rhythm guitarist, bass, drums and ever-present \\"vocusionist\\" Toca Rivera on board, the sound on Beautiful Mess is full and robust but never becomes overbearing or cluttered.    The DVD also contains a pair of featurettes.  \\"Un Beau Desordre\\" is a mocumentary featuring Mraz and long-time pal/roommate Billy \\"Bushwalla\\" Galewood touring Charter One and \\"overseeing\\" every part of the show's production.  \\"We Sing, We Dance, We Make Videos\\" features director Darren Doane and Mraz sharing the story, and behind the scenes footage, of their collaboration on the three videos from the latest album; \\"I'm Yours\\", \\"Make it Mine\\" and \\"Lucky\\".    Beautiful Mess vs. Tonight Not Again    I'm sure there are more than a few folks just discovering Mraz and debating which live DVD they should pick up.  To avoid the wholly useless (though completely justified) advice of \\"get both\\", I'll offer a bit of comparison.  Both shows are enjoyable yet vastly different in both content and production.  Sound wise, the significantly smaller Eagles Ballroom gives Tonight Not Again a more intimate feel while the outdoor Charter One Pavilion lends a grander, more expansive tone to Beautiful Mess. Both mixes are high quality, with vocals appropriately up front.  The horns play a more prominent role on Beautiful Mess with the Grooveline boys taking a few welcome solos while The Ohio Players appear only on select tracks on Tonight Not Again.  I would say that for live DVDs, both shows offer a pretty good balance of crowd noise.  That is to say that neither show really suffers from any sort of distracting screaming, though there may be a few debatable moments on Tonight Not Again.    The setlists from the two shows are completely different with the only duplicate song between the two being \\"The Remedy\\" which is performed in a completely different style on Beautiful Mess.  Both albums reflect the album being toured to support at the time, but Beautiful Mess also offers a couple of new tunes.    Both DVDs contain some fun bonus features.  Tonight Not Again features the 20 minute \\"International So and So\\" which follows Mraz on part of his world tour as well as a behind the scenes featurette on the taping of the show.  Beautiful Mess follows suit with the Mocumentary \\"Un Beau Desordre\\" featuring Bushwalla and the featurette We Sing, We Dance, We Make videos.  Both will be well worthwatching for fans and entertaining at the least for the casually acquainted.    The biggest difference between the two CD/DVDs, other than song content, might be that Tonight Not Again features interspersed interview segments between songs, while Beautiful Mess sticks to just the music.  Both shows lack much of the between song banter that's become familiar to Mraz fans but doesn't lend itself well to a live recording.    In general, I'd say that fans of We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things will definitely want to pick up Beautiful Mess if you're interested in hearing those songs fully realized in the live setting or look into Tonight Not Again if you're more interested in hearing what else Mraz has to offer (which is plenty).  Past that, comparing the two DVDs really becomes a matter of apples and oranges so flip a coin, pick one up, then save your pennies and grab the other one when you can.
0882709194|1.0|so my roommate came home with a \\"christmas\\" present from school for me. I looked at it, \\"origin of species\\", yay!! I have been wanting to buy this book for a long time but didn't really intend on reading it because I'm not an atheist or a theist. . I try to transcend such silly ideas, and therefore don't have a negative predisposition against such a revolutionary and inspirational theory such as Darwins. I asked him where he got the book, and he said someone was just handing it out for free on campus. This was the first red flag. I thought it was odd and just placed the book aside for a couple days.     Fast forward to today and I looked at it again; in small lettering on the very bottom of the front cover (almost like the small lettering in commercials) it says \\"special introduction by Ray Comfort\\". \\"Wait a minute\\" I thought to myself, I know that name from my fervently atheist days of early college and high school. Sure enough, instead of a respectable book to add to my library I am now cursed with book that has a terrible multiple-personality disorder that has no home. If you don't recognize the name like I did, then spend 5 minutes on youtube searching for ray comfort and you will quickly amass the horror that crept into my body when I read that name off.     This bothers me for two reasons. First, I know what I believe; if other people are so insecure with what they believe that they have to advertise their beliefs down my throat with \\"free\\" cloaked books, then it sounds like they need to read some actual books themselves (first one that comes to mind is that awful incoherent, contradictory piece of garbage bible thingy). Second, evolution??? really???? why? because it is a theory? gravity is a theory too, along with many other ideas. I don't get why every theist is perfectly happy not knowing jack about any science but then they pull out their P(suedo)h.D in evolutionary biology. Whatever, I don't even care, I am a chemist and I like to stick to what matters to my personal Dasein.     Sorry for being lengthy but the insult that is this book deserved a proper review. If you don't believe what I do, I don't care, believe what you want. The only thing in life you can be sure of is this moment, don't waste it.
B000VZMQD8|4.0|...Marianne had attempted two comeback albums prior to Broken English, the first attempt was way back in 1970, and an attempt that was never finished, Rich Kid Blues, and never released in its time. in 1976 there was her country album Faithless, Dreamin' My Dreams, No Regrets, whatever you call it was a success in Ireland of all places, it was a fine attempt, though not a huge success. Then you have Broken English, and what followed was Marianne's most productive time since the 60s-musically that is. The stand outs are obvious-Broken English, Ballad of Lucy Jordan, Why You'd Do It. Working Class Hero is a fine cover. The only song I didn't like was the Witches SOng, due to strong personal conviction, I don't like it so much. Other than that we have a strong debut of Marianne's second career.
1594488878|5.0|I only had to know a couple of things to buy this book -- it was by Nick Hornby and it was about an obscure reclusive musician.    Sure enough, I could relate to several of the characters and situations in the book.      Shortly after my wife also enjoyed reading the book, we received a new CD anthology that included a song by our close friend, an obscure and reclusive rock star.  There was a picture included that mis-identified our friend, and we howled with delight that this was just the sort of situation that Hornby's Duncan would have taken to heart and obsessed over.  And spread to the far corners of the seas.     This book is especially fun if you have a passion for something a bit out of the mainstream.  Me, I'm exclusively into those obscure musicians working on their own little mountain tributaries, far from the main stream.  So, it was a delight to read.      I sometimes find it hard to write about the music I love so much, and it's great to see somebody writing well about music nobody has heard -- or made.      If they do make it into a movie, our friend could easily create the songs to the playlist on Hornby's fictitious album.
B000WOXQDM|4.0|Many children that grew up in the 80s will say that they grew up listening to Madonna. I grew up listening to No Doubt-I remember this cd well, Don't Speak, SUnday Morning, You Can Do It, and End it on this were my favorites! Still are actually. This album is a classic.
B002NXSRVG|5.0|My soon to be 7 boy loved it on the big screen and rates it as his \\"best movie ever\\", at least until he saw Astro Boy a few weeks ago - twice. We have hundreds of family fodder films, so his viewing experience isn't exactly limited. When a kid loves something so much, how can it not be top rated?     As an old fart of a parent, it's reasonable as generic action flicks go. Probably on par with the likes of the Fantastic Four offerings. A few gags and reasonable action, nothing to get excited about really, but hardly one star fodder. I guess if you're a prepubescent teen or older, you'd be better of saving your pennies for other stuff unless you're an action fan nut, but a boy under 10 will probably love it.    My son keeps nagging me about when the follow up is coming out. He doesn't ask that very often.
B002KVSJ64|4.0|This album make sense to be surrounded by sorrow, since lead singer Ben's grandfather passed away in 2008, but there are some great songs on this album. I wouldn't say that it matches the fantastic \\"We are not alone\\" album, but it's right there with it. Better than \\"Phobia\\" in my opinion and while it often times does sound more radio friendly, it still is very hard hitting and much more growns and growls in the backgrounds (which I'm not always crazy about, but it works here).    Highlights:  Fade Away  Crawl  Hopeless  Dear Agony  Anthem of the Angels  What lies Beneath  Without You    Only song I'm not crazy about is \\"Lights Out\\".
B002HWRYJE|4.0|I must admit I was unsure I would enjoy this outing at first...but once it became clear that this movie was done as an alternate timeline, I began really enjoying it. Spock meeting himself is priceless, the inner turmoil Spock faced as a youngster, all was true to our beloved original series. Some sequences were admittedly overstated, and the Romulans were frankly straight out of a horror movie, but I definitely liked it...the computer voice of Majel Barret/Rodenberry was a big plus factor, sadly we will hear her voice no more...

0385504225|5.0|Dan Brown's writing is like waving a wand that transports his readers into the story line.  I know that the monuments in DC have a special significance and I love the way that Mr. Brown weaved it all together.  I find myself talking to the book telling characters to hurry up or wait, don't do that.  Now this is a book!  There are concepts in the book regarding being gods and being made in the image and likeness of God is what is taught in my church so I was glad to see it fused into the story line.  These are simple truths that can be found in the bible but they are rarely, if ever, taught from the pulpit.  I like how Mr. Brown put up front the facts that would be found in his book.  But folks should research for themselves anyway.  Gotta' love Dan Brown and his style of writing!
B002SEW5WW|5.0|After a very tough year and a sequence of accidents and incidents that finally made me crash emotionally, I was recently diagnosed with depression. Feeling lonely and helpless I struggled for over 4 weeks to shake it off, reason with myself and get myself back to normal again.     I received this CD in the mail yesterday from a mystery friend who seemed to have noticed me from a distance that I had shut myself out from the world but needed help. There was no note, no name of the sender but the music and lyrics said it all... touched my heart heart, and uplifted my sprits. For the first time in months, I woke up feeling positive, hopeful and ready to open myself to world and find the joy and love for life again. I had never heard of this group before, but this is music that touches the soul. It made me feel loved and really woke me up to a world full of love, kindness and beautiful souls - just the way I knew it before.    I hope my mystery friend reads this and knows how thankful and deeply moved I am. The holiday season is upon us and amidst all the celebrations there are many who a lonely and have no one to celebrate with. If music is one of their passions, this CD is just the perfect way to pay it forward and make someone feel loved. I am awake now and ready to spread the love and the joy of music again. Having experienced the healing with this precious gift of soul stirring music, the only way I can truly thank my mystery friend is by pay it forward. I hope anyone who has read this review will feel inspired to do the same after reading this... if it did we are \\"Marching on...\\". Love n peace to all.
0385341008|5.0|This is one of the best novels I have read in years.  Using the device of a letter exchange between all the characters was brilliant.  By doing so, the author let the reader become intimately familiar with every character.  The story, based loosely on the actual experiences of the inhabitants of Guernsey during WWII, was lucid and compelling. I just simply couldn't stop reading once I had started.  Be sure to read the author's remarks after the end of the book.  For once, they actually contributed to the book.
B002T9H2MO|5.0|I have seen a lot of movies this year and \\"Moon\\" is one of the few that I truly and thoroughly enjoyed. I don't even know where to begin with my praise. It is hard for me to believe that this movie was made on the meagre budget of only 5 million Dollars! Most Hollywood directors would have a laughing fit and say it is impossible to make a movie with pocket money like that, but \\"Moon\\" doesn't look cheap. Not one bit. It is a very sleek movie. The SFX are not used to dazzle but to enhance the look and turn the already wonderful set of a lunar base into something that really sits on the moon. It is re-freshing to have a SciFi movie in which the SFX take a back seat. The score by Clint Mansell is a beautiful understated affair that fits perfectly to the tone of the overall story. No. This movie is not cheap. It is elegant and Duncan Jones and the whole production team need to be congratulated for this amazing achievement!     For Sam Rockwell the movie is a tour de force. This is a one man show and it could have gone all horribly wrong with a less talented actor, but his acting just blew me away.  I am hoping against hope that this movie will have a wider release. So far it has been only shown on various film festivals like the Viennale, Sundance or Tribeca and only had a wider release in the UK. I really do not want to see this movie to become an insider like \\"The Fall\\". It really deserves recognition. It doesn't happen very often, that a movie this good comes along and  Sam Rockwell and Duncan Jones should receive at least some awards. I will cross my fingers.
B001QIP5A0|5.0|With surround sound, this is a very immersive title ! It felt you could reach out and touch some of the fish and the IMAX sound experience is just awesome.
0061914177|5.0|The book is an easy read and straight forward guide to getting yourself established in social media. One can feel Gary's personality and energy, as he tells the reader what needs to be done to develop a significant presence in the social media arena. This is not a 'learn the secrets' book. There is no fluff, no jargon, or insider lingo. I am implementing what he recommends and telling others about this informative and important book.

B001QERPDO|3.0|The Script being the self-titled debut album from the Script is a very ordinary release with generic lyrics and sound. Being a person that constantly listens to music I have heard this before and with much better vocals and lyrics. Allmusic, The Guardian and The Times gave it 2 to 2.5 out of 5 which is a bit low. However more then 3/5 would be way to much. All the lyrics are included in the booklet but not a list of whom plays what. A very ordinary and boring release but not a shoddy one. 3/5.
B000LE1GVW|5.0|A really great music CD from Paolo. has songs you can really relate to & his voice makes you listen & sing along. some songs are so soulful & then other songs make you get up & dance. I wish he would make a music DVD so we could watch as well.
B002K0WBXW|4.0|This is a good movie for entertainment.  It has many strange twists that add to the humor.  It also shows us that we should not prejudge people as they may not be what them seem.  My wife and I watched it several times and enjoyed it each time.
B0017CW5J4|5.0|Excellent musicians!  This video was entertaining from the beginning to end.  This band is so unique; I've never seen anything quite like it before.
B000AMPZF8|5.0|Like a lot of people here in the US, I first learned of this band thanks to Stephenie Meyer, who mentioned Muse in the acknowledgements of her Twilight novels. Curious, I looked them up on Wikipedia, then immediately headed over to Amazon.com to hear what I could of their music. I first bought Showbiz, which I absolutely loved. Then came this, its followup, Origin of Symmetry. In fact I own all of their studio albums except their newest one (which I do intend to get at some point), as well as their CD/DVD combo HAARP.    Origins is just as solid as Showbiz was and, in many ways, even more so. Whereas the opening track of Showbiz, Sunburn, opened with a neat piano arpeggio, New Born, Origins' opener, opens with a hauntingly beautiful piano riff and then quickly builds into a pounding rocker with some of the coolest lyrics ever. The second track. Bliss, is the other of my two favorites. It also opens with a dreamy keyboard before quickly picking up. The rest of the tracks, while in no way forgettable, haven't yet caught my attention the way the first two did. But they're definitely still worth listening and there aren't any that I skip.

B002QEXN2K|3.0|And now for something completely different. I've been lazily writing about various things for the past year or so and I've yet to review a music album. This is possibly because nothing has been released in the past year that I really felt compelled to write about. Popular music is getting more and more bland. Nothing jumps out at you anymore in any meaningful way. This is likely the reason why I've listened to nothing but Bruce Springsteen for the past year. The Boss is REAL music!    Anyway, the last time I cared about any new music that actually delivered was way back in 2006 which brought about the holy trinity of Bat Out of Hell III, The Black Parade, and Continuum. Those were good times and good tunes. Great albums since then (that I've heard anyway) have been pretty scattered. I've been pretty disappointed by many a new release in that time.    Rewinding to 2006, I remember picking up Continuum by John Mayer not long after I'd moved away from home for the first time, and I instantly connected with it in a way I'd never connected with music before. Practically every song could be applied to something that was going on in my life at that time. Not to mention the album was cohesive, deep, catchy, and musically diverse.    Fast-forward to now, three years later. I have recently moved away from home for the second time and here comes another Mayer album. I was very much looking forward to this record, and the pre-release buzz was palpable. I've struggled to really find a soundtrack to my time here and I was expecting Battle Studies to be it. I was expecting the same musical and songwriting quality found on Continuum.    Boy was I wrong.    Let me preface (assuming the preceding 4 paragraphs weren't a preface) by saying that Battle Studies isn't a bad album, per se. It's just not a very good one. It's more of a collection of cool ideas than complete coherent songs. It's also extremely derivative of other work. Anyway, keep in mind this is just a snap judgment and Imay change my tune after listening to it for a few days. For now though, after having listened to it once or twice, this is how I feel. I'll break it down track by track to better explain:    1. Heartbreak Warfare - A bit of an odd choice for opener. It is, however, a strong track and easily one of the best on the album. Having heard this one a month or so ago is what really got me exciting about the record.    Sighs.    2. All We Ever Do Is Say Goodbye - This song has some beautiful instrumentation but for the most part is just dull. It gets a little more interesting towards the conclusion but this one is just kind of there.    3. Half of My Heart - Featuring a meaningless vocal by Taylor Swift, this is the best song on the album. That statement was meant in no way to be a negative about Taylor Swift, it's just that there just doesn't seem to be much point in having her here other than star power. This isn't a duet or anything, she just sings backup. As for the song itself, it sounds like Fleetwood Mac doing a 90s rock song, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The song is very catchy and could easily fit in with Mayer's previous, better work.-    4. Who Says - This is the album's lead single, for some reason. I remember hearing this on the radio and being a little worried. Not that it's bad, I just wouldn't want it representing the entire album since none of the other tracks sound remotely like it. This song is also very lazy and sounds like it's trying to be Stop This Train Part 2 by way of 3x5. Still, it's a reasonably catchy tune that you might be humming for a while after you hear it.    5. Perfectly Lonely - The album sort of picks up here, as this is a great rock song with a pretty good guitar lick. It's sad though that one of the best songs on this album would have been just b-side material on his previous albums.    6. Assassins - Again, I may change my mind, but for now I'm ready to say that this is the worst song Mayer has ever recorded. It's worse thanOnly Heart. It's worse than #13 on Room For Squares. It has some neat musical ideas but the lyric is stupid and the song just doesn't go anywhere. In my note (and hey! This IS my note!) that makes for a bad song.    7. Crossroads - Cover of the old Robert Johnson song which was made popular by Cream. This version sticks pretty close to the Cream version, and while relatively inoffensive and fun to listen to, this version just doesn't really bring anything new or exciting to the song. The track is also wildly out of place on this album, nothing at all like Bold As Love on Continuum which perfectly fit the tone of the album.    8. War of My Life - This could have been a great song but is lacking that something extra to really push it over the edge. It'd a decent song and good for a listen, but in a year no one will remember it unless he comes up with a really smokin' live version.    9. Edge of Desire - This power ballad is the only song I really connected with on the album. Again, it would have been b-side material on any other album, but here it really stands out. It has some pretty good guitar and some syrupy sweet yet poignant lyrics. Crap title though.    10. Do You Know Me - Yawn. Skip it.    11. Friends, Lovers, or Nothing - Like most of the others on this album, this song could have been a great one if it had just been fleshed out a little more. As it stands however, it just sounds like it is desperately trying to be this album's I'm Gonna Find Another You and it just never goes anywhere. It can be a good listen though if you appreciate it for what it is and don't expect too much.    In conclusion, I just don't think Battle Studies was worth the wait. It isn't terrible and it isn't brilliant. It just kind of is. If you like John Mayer you'll probably find something you like on here, just don't expect to have your mind blown, unless it's blown by the mediocrity.
0385341008|5.0|Very interesting and well written.  It is written as letters back and forth wherein the story evolves about how one tiny town experienced the German invasion and the Holocaust.  If you like that subject, you will like this book.  I enjoyed it and would recommend it.
B00003CX97|1.0|A documentary on the History Channel interviewed many of the veterans who were POWs that actually lived through what the movie attempts to dramatize ... every single one of these vets hated what was portrayed in this movie.  I don't care how good a movie was made, if it's an insult to the veterans who were there, then it's an embarrassment.
B002NWRMVS|2.0|I'll cut to the heart of the matter and say that I'm disappointed with this recording.  To me, Norah Jones's voice works best with slow, bluesy songs and I think that that's why most people gave her a thumbs up on her album Come Away With Me.  There was nothing like her back then.  Though the sultry voice is still there, the upbeat songs on The Fall just don't do her voice justice.  None of the songs are downright bad, but none of them are great either.    Norah, get back to where you once belonged...

B0015OKWL2|3.0|Apart from the cast, there's really very little to separate this from a whole slew of straight to DVD thrillers.  Which makes it all the more a mystery why DeNiro and Pacino chose this as their next vehicle to star in together, having created such screen heat in.. well, Heat.    DeNiro and Pacino are both cops, both veterans (well, they'd have to be wouldn't they...) who end up investigating a vigilante serial killer.  As the clues start to appear, suspicion grows that the killer is in fact a cop.. so who can be trusted, and just who is telling the truth...?  Well, that's the set up, but it's great potential is somehow fumbled.  The tag line of `the two best actors alive at the top of their game' is certainly somewhat overstated, but the fault does not lie there - rather it is in a weak story directed in such a straight forward way that red herrings are just rather too obvious.  It's really not that bad, and has its own stylistic flourishings along the way - however it is also not half as clever as it seems to think it is, and the ending is unlikely to surprise anyone.  Fortunately it is only 97 minutes so does not overstay its welcome too long.. certainly bearable for an undemanding watch, but when you factor in the disappointment factor of having two such great stars so sorely underused, this would come down a notch to a two star movie...
B002NWRMVS|5.0|No more man. No more band. What's a girl to do?    This is what you might want to consider upon stepping into the world of \\"The Fall,\\" Norah Jones' 4th album. After splitting with her longtime boyfriend and collaborator Lee Alexander, followed by the end of her long time \\"Handsome Band,\\" one would logically assume Norah would want to take some time off to decompress and get away from all of this...right?    Fortunately for her fans, that's just not how Norah works. Instead of grinding to a halt, she ramped up her musical output more than ever, collaborating with artists like Q-Tip and old friend Jesse Harris, refining her guitar chops in the New York underground club circuit with yet another underground band, and last but not least...pouring her heart out writing this album, the first that was put together without Lee or the Handsome Band.    And with the Fall, we have the beautiful end result. For the first time ever, Norah is in full control of the creative, musical, and lyrical direction of this record, and it is unbelievably refreshing, for old and new fans. For those of us who thought Not Too Late was a \\"restrained departure\\" of sorts, well the kid gloves are off now. Here, you have Norah finally breaking free of her \\"coffeehouse chains,\\" so to speak.     Musically, the album is a slap in the face to those who mocked her in the past by christening her as \\"Snorah.\\" From the opener, \\"Chasing Pirates,\\" you can hear effected guitars, piano, and a host of other electronic instruments that you would have never expected to see in a Norah Jones song. The catchy, poppy, top-40 friendly single should do wonders to get Norah onto pop stations in earnest. The new band she has put together features some who's who of indie, from drummer Joey Waronker to Smokey Hormel, to even the producer she enlisted--Jacquire King, best known for his work with Kings of Leon and Modest Mouse. You can kind of start to get a picture that Norah was going for a particular sound, and by changingthe band and production to those familiar with such a sound, she ensures that she nails it. She hits tempos that you have never thought she'd dare attempt (even on an El Madmo record!) with the almost \\"Beautiful People\\"-sounding \\"It's Gonna Be.\\" Just a really catchy and fresh sound that at the same time, doesn't ever sound pretentious, which is what Norah has always been successful at avoiding.    Creatively, the album follows the the \\"darkness\\" of Not Too Late by revealing itself to be a rather sad album. You get a \\"detached\\" sort of vibe from this record overall. King's echo-heavy, \\"spacey\\" production is a direct contrast from Lee's more roomy style, but it fits the mood Norah was going for perfectly...following the theme of the album, things are unclear, things are very abstract, and things are definitely in flux. The track listing definitely seems to follow an order as well, starting off relatively coy and playful with \\"Chasing Pirates\\" and \\"Even Though,\\" but eventually sinking to sadness with \\"I Wouldn't Need You,\\" to outright depression by the time we reach \\"Stuck,\\" and finally \\"recovering\\" with Norah's trademark \\"final track piano solo song\\" with \\"Man of the Hour\\". This continues a long standing tradition for Norah to end all her records with a solo piano song. Incidentally, \\"Man of the Hour\\" also reflects the album cover, playfully stating her desire to be on her own, with her dog, rather than getting together with a man.    And in line with that, the lyrical content in this record finally allows Norah to express herself on her own. Reflecting upon it now, it might have been too obvious in the past when more than one person wrote a song on the previous records. But in this case, even when there are songs like that, you can tell it's just for musical assistance. The lyrical content in this record has one theme, and it screams out loud: \\"Breakup album.\\" There are no mixed messages here, and there is definitely a flow to things. The lyrical content is also quite edgier--for example, Norah talks about physicality more openly (instead of being abstract about it), declaring \\"something about the way he touched me was so slow...\\" in \\"Even Though\\", she talks about \\"potheads\\" and \\"taking showers together\\" in \\"Man of the Hour,\\" and in \\"It's Gonna Be\\" she rants on the state of the entertainment industry, declaring \\"Now if a princess becomes human/don't stone her on a talk show, you'll ruin\\". Norah also finally lets her voice rip as well, particularly on \\"You've Ruined Me,\\" where she exposes what her long time fans have known all along to be a formidable vocal range.    So perfect album, right? Unfortunately, I have to dock a little bit (.25 stars) because after you hear the outtakes, you get upset. That's right--even after all this goodness, you can tell she's STILL holding back. There were two tracks recorded for this album that didn't make the cut, \\"Can't Stop\\" and \\"That's What I Said,\\" and in my opinion both of these should have been added but were probably removed because they would have marked too radical of a departure for Norah. In Can't Stop, Norah practically moans that she \\"Can't Stop Loving You\\" over an '80s style glam rock musical landscape, while in \\"That's What I Said\\" she purrs coyly over an R&B style track about \\"sex machines\\" and someone \\"picking their nose and wiping it on the girls you like to hose and expose...\\" even playfully deepening her voice in a ridiculous deadpan at times. It's an incredible shame that the latter track in particular was axed, as Jacquire King noted that this was just the result of Norah and him experimenting around in their first recording session together and was \\"outside of where the record found its place.\\" Count me amongst those that would be thrilled and fascinated to hear what else they cooked up at this session, because this track is unlike anything Norah has ever done before.    In spite of that, it's still incredible to have seen Norah Jones evolve from demure, polite, inoffensive songbird to a singer/songwriter and now to brash indie rock princess.  This album is a wonderful addition to a discography that shows constant growth, maturity, and fearlessness as an artist, and might be her finest work yet. Don't miss out, and get this one now. 4.75/5.
0783240236|5.0|Hitchcock's 1963 drama/horror/thriller \\"The Birds\\" details the story of a city woman (Tippi Hedren) going to the rural coastal town Bodega Bay to play a coquettish prank on a lawyer whom she met in the city (Rod Taylor). As she starts to get to know the town the birds mysteriously attack in force.<br /><br />\\"The Birds\\" might well be the first official nature-runs-amok flick, which were made hugely popular a dozen years later with the release of \\"Jaws,\\" the film that opened the Pandora's box to creature-on-the-loose flicks.<br /><br />I believe \\"The Birds\\" should be enjoyed at face value as a simple story of birds mysteriously attacking a coastal hamlet, but a more allegorical interpretation is that Melanie (Hedren) represents modern ideas (for 1963, that is) that attempt to infect the rural communities where people live and think in a simpler, more conservative way. The village is not ready to accept and incorporate these \\"new\\" concepts and so nature itself attempts to vomit out the infection, irregardless of hometown damage and casualties. Yet this interpretation seems to be rejected by the film itself in the restaurant scene where the mother with two kids hysterically rebukes Melanie for supposedly causing the bird attacks; when Melanie slaps the mother, this irrational notion is 'slapped' out of the viewer as well, as if to say, \\"That's stupid, Melanie is not the cause of this, whether literally or figuratively.\\"<br /><br />WHAT DOESN'T WORK:<br /><br />- For the better part of an hour the story plays out as a slow drama, which will likely turn off those with ADHD. Personally, I find this approach refreshing in light of the frenetic editing and absurd action sequences of modern \\"blockbusters.\\" Films like \\"The Birds\\" seem almost daring by comparison; in fact, it's startling. Besides, the beautiful Bodega Bay photography provides some nice backdrop eye-candy to help maintain one's attention with the soap operatics.<br />- One obvious plot hole is: Why do Melanie, the schoolmarm and the kids flee the schoolhouse? Wouldn't it be wiser to simply blockade themselves in an inner room with no windows? Or maybe there isn't such an interior room big enough to fit all the kids; after all, it appears to be a fairly small schoolhouse.<br />- Complaints about Melanie's supposedly lame prank on Mitch (Taylor) are nitpicking at best; and criticisms of Melanie foolishly searching for the source of a mysterious sound -- even though she must know what it is -- can easily be chalked up to curiosity killing the cat (for instance, while stopping by Point Pleasant, WV, on vacation in 2005 I went into an old abandoned building that used to be a home for troubled kids back in the day; my wife refused to go any where near the creepy domicile but I HAD to go in and look around; even the satanic graffiti and shocked birds flying out the windows didn't deter me!).<br />- After recently seeing films like the remake of \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" and \\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\\", I can hardly find \\"The Birds\\" horrifying, although I certainly find it very entertaining. Really, the creepiest aspect of the movie is Mitch's hovering, suspicious mother, played by Jessica Tandy -- whoa, is she scary.<br />- The age difference of Mitch and his sister seems off. Taylor (Mitch) was 33 years-old during filming, although he looks to be more like 40 or older, but his sister in the story (Veronica Cartwright) was only 13. That's a twenty-year difference. I could see her being his daughter, but his sister? Also, if Veronica is 13 that means his creepy mother had sex a mere 13 years before -- and that's a really scary thought!<br /><br />WHAT WORKS:<br /><br />- As noted above, the slow dialogue-driven drama of the first hour is actually appealing in light of the modern glut of moronic cgi-laden, frenetically-edited drivel, not to mention the awesome coastal Northern California cinematography.<br />- Viewing the film is like going back in time to the early 60s. It's entertaining to see the clothing and decor styles, as well as social interactions, etc.<br />- Although I don't find Tippi sexy, I do enjoy her facial expressions. I know this is an odd comment, but she does have that Paul Stanley pouty lips rockstar expression down pat.<br />- Suzanne Pleshette's in the cast -- now SHE's sexy.<br />- There are numerous memorable and thrilling sequences -- the various bird attacks, the guy with no eye balls, the phone booth scene, etc. I also enjoyed the interesting discussion on birds in the diner sequence<br />- [END SPOILER!] I love the mysterious way the film ends with no explanation or dialogue. The sea of birds seem to permit their departure, even though the fowls could easily stop them if they wanted.<br /><br />The film runs 2 hours.<br /><br />GRADE: A-interactions, etc.  - Although I don't find Tippi sexy, I do enjoy her facial expressions.

B000W93CXQ|5.0|An amazing gripping book.  I couldn't stop reading, but I didn't want it to end.  I'm sure it will stay with me forever.
B000JSI7AI|5.0|The DVD,and collector cards were in pristine condition.  The DVD case was a little worn. An excellent value for the price.
B0000026UV|5.0|...that's how often I listen to this.    I've got lots of music on my iPod, and I return to this album frequently.    There's just no pro like an old pro, and here are two of them riffing off each other in the most delightful ways. Warm and rich, this is like great dark chocolate. It goes with everything, and always makes me feel good.
B002O1TMI4|5.0|My teenage daughter has been listening to Muse for about a year or so with her college buddies, while I was listening to other stuff: Gomez, Radiohead, Porcurpine Tree, etc.  When Resistance came out, my daughter kept telling me I should listen to it, but I just didn't get around to it (was it resistance?!).  So about 2 weeks ago I finally asked for her Resistance CD.  After 1 listen I heard enough to immediately recognize that I was going to have to listen to it several times to get through the layers, and to let each song reveal itself to me.    So after 10 or so listens, I am really impressed with every song on this album.  Right now, I am not tired of any of them, even though I thought I wouldn't like some of the more Maroon5 sounding stuff (\\"I Belong To You\\", \\"Uprising\\") after the first listen.  But listening straight thru this CD, I am not reaching for the Next button on my Zune.  I appreciate and enjoy the song order straight thru.    Matthew Bellamy is obviously equally comfortable and expressive on guitar and keyboards.  There are the obvious nods to Queen, Radiohead, Travis (on steroids), and positive Porcupine Tree (like the crunchy guitar outtake on \\"Unnatural Selection\\").  \\"Exogenesis Symphony\\" is breathtaking in its beauty and quiet power.  When it's over, it leaves such a sweet taste in your mouth, you are ready to hit play and go thru them all again!    I have been going back now to Absolution and Black Holes to hear older stuff.  The engineering on Absolution is a bit more muffled that Black Holes and The Resistance.  The Resistance is crisp and punchy -- really clear and engaging.    Just excellent stuff!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A simply smashing \\"tail\\", The Art of Raining in the Rain had me at the first chapter.  It is so well written and deeply moving that I was sad to put it down.  Please give this book a try, you won't be disappointed.
B001AVCFK6|4.0|Simply put this is a retelling of a great story, with Nimoy thrown in to provide a tidbit of continuity for the Trekkies (which worked well IMHO). Not too much techie sci-fi with alot of nonsensical technobabble. Just enough to add a reasonable level of future technologies without getting into the details. When the transporter saves our heroes one minute but cannot do the same exact thing the next time its not important to know why. Not in the context of a 2 hour movie. This approach greatly helps. Good action... as all adventures should have. Good characters, albeit without alot of time for development because things have to move fast. Natural for a first movie. Perfect interplay between Kirk, Spock and McCoy. All the technical aspects of the bluray edition are first rate. I just wish I had a bigger TV for it.    I guarantee that many of those who do not like the movie would instead think it was great if all the characters were different, not a prequel, but still the same exact story minus the time travel aspects. Also, like all prequels when it goes against what people have built up over the years what they think the various events should have been, or how they occurred, some take issue.    But thats ok. So why say that? Because when all is said and done this is a good Star Trek adventure and a worthy addition to a collection... unlike any of the other summer blockbusters that came out in 2009. Just dont expect the sci-fi equivalent of Shakespeare.

B00006GFAB|5.0|The CD was in perfect condition. It sounds great. The only problem I have is the amount of time it took to receive it.

0553057006|1.0|This book did not tell me anything new, did not help out at all, contained a lot of obvious statements, and I cannot believe it was written by a Ph. D. I had already understood all those things by myself during my life years, without having to get a Ph.D. I am very disappointed and wish I could have spent my money in a better way.
0761119752|5.0|My daughters (4 yrs. & 2.5 yrs) adore Sandra Boynton books & this is one of their favorites (along w/ The Going to Bed Book) for bedtime! THe can chant right along as I read & I love that they can get their energy out & then hush, hush at the end! Perfect transition for another story & getting snuggled up in bed!
B000N4SHOE|5.0|If you are over 13, as I am, you can thoroughly enjoy this film for the superb acting of Renee Zellweger and Ewan McGregor as well as Emily Watson. The scenery of Old England and the story of Beatrix Potter is fascinating.
0671449028|5.0|The Going to Bed Book by Sandra Boynton is a bedtime favorite in our household. My daughters (4 yrs. & 2.5 yrs) enthusiastically recite the story along with me as I read! This simple story of animals getting ready for bed (putting on pajamas, brushing teeth, exercising & finally getting in bed) on a boat is sure to please!
B001KVZ6G6|1.0|Watched it in the theater, loved it.<br /><br />Blu-ray arrived yesterday, won't play in my PS3, just sits there on black screen. All my other Blu-rays play just fine.

B00021R7CG|3.0|People who were a part of the Cold War saw holes big enough to drive a B-52 through.<br /><br />A good yarn but a technically flawed. The writers were too busy dumping on the military-industrial complex and trigger-happy politicians to actually get it right.<br /><br />There was enough of a good story here to keep me from flushing it but there were big problems with facts like the Continuity of Goverenment(COG) Plan and SIOP (Single Integrated Operational Plan).<br /><br />Writers do your research! SOme of us were there and know when you are spinning Bravo Sierra.
B002NWRMVS|5.0|Norah Jones did one more fantastic album. She continues to explore, with every new album something new she brings in and shows before our eyes and ears. She's incredibly talented one, for only such artists can breathe a kaleidoscope of different genres and musical styles. If she can do amazingly soulful jazz, bluegrass, explore rock and pop, sit in front of piano and strum an electric guitar, sing with Ray Charles and Peter Mallick Group, Dolly Parton and many others, I call that one incredible talent too afraid to be put into one shoebox .. but rather asking her audience humbly to set her free.   Don't try it folks; you can't fit Norah Jones into your shoe boxes and expect her singing all the same tunes all over again. If you like one of her albums, go and listen to it till you drop. But she has a right to explore music as she likes, and those who join her on the colourful journey, privileged are indeed and will enjoy music in its true sense.  Always new, always different, always unexpected. Exciting as Chasing Pirates, refreshing and Light as a Feather, Stuck in always new. I can even Tell Yer Mamma would like ya to find a wonderful lady like Norah is.
B000000WHC|5.0|First saw Gary Moore in the '80's (thanks Dave).<br />These tracks are fabulous and timeless!<br />One of my favorites' off all times!<br />Gary Moore really serenades' the listener!
1594481784|5.0|High Fidelity is a movie I have enjoyed watching numerous times so I decided, finally, to read the book from which it was made. Nick Hornby's spare, clean, descriptive prose without a single unnecessary word, had me hooked from the first page. After finishing the book I ordered a few of his other books, read those, then re-read High Fidelity. It is a book that will stay in my permanent library to be read again and again.
0756655307|5.0|I bought this book for my 10 year old son, in the hopes of turning him into a hopeless comic book nerd like his old man.  It should do the trick.  This book has EVERYONE in it.  Every single obscure, flash-in-the-pan character who ever rubbed elbows with Captain America or traded quips with Spider-Man is in this volume.  The only drawback to this comprehensive compendium of colossal combantants (how's my Stan Lee impression?) is that the histories of major characters must be severely compressed for the sake of space.  If you want the full story on figures like The Hulk or Iron Man, you'll have to go with a more specialized reference source, such as the Avengers Encyclopedia. I was also disappointed to find that my copy has a small tear on the dust jacket, but at 30% off of the cover price, I can't complain too much.  The Marvel Ecyclopedia should provide hours of interesting reading, both for me and my son.
1401323820|5.0|Received the book within a week.  The book was in excellent condition and enjoyed it very much.  I like shopping through Amazon.com.
B000GY729M|5.0|Some really well-written reviews here already, so I may be in the minority here as Sam's Town is vastly superior to The Killers initial album in my honest opinion. I thought of a new wave-Queen sound when listening to this CD as it has an almost operatic quality to it. And it's just loaded with hits (very catchy tunes).    This CD firmly establishes the band as not some other flash-in-the-pan; they indeed are the real deal. One of just a handful of modern bands that I'd really like to see live.
B002OEBMN4|5.0|This album and Endgame are the best metal albums of 2009 by far, 2009 IS truly the year of metal.  Rock/metal has been making a huge comeback in the last few years thank god and talentless garbage like Britney has been shown for what we metal fans knew it was since it began.  Anyhow, this album is great, every song is a masterwork in perfect Slayer style.  World Painted Blood has great lyrics and a similar theme to Endgame about where the human race is heading.  The riffs are pure classic Slayer style in the same vein as Reign in Blood, the vox are amazing as usual, the twin assault of Jeff & Kerry is still as powerful as ever and Lombardo's drumming is top notch.  Today as always I proud to be a hardcore Slayer fan!
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|This book was not good.  It had some elements that I did like, for example the origins of modern words and expressions and discussion of ancient symbols and their origins.  But at the end of the day what this book was about was a bunch of people genuinely sympathetic to religion and the possibilty of ESP like energies that link religion to science.  Sorry, but the faith healers out there at large are HOAKSTERs plain and simple.  There is no \\"Force\\" out there which they are channelling to turn cancer cells into healty cells.  It's pure hoaksterism, or else why not just openly publish these miracle cures in medical journals, earning yourself a nobel prize while you're at it.  Ever notice that faith healers never cure somebody who has amputated limbs?  It's always a disease that might have been easily faked on either the patient's sick side or on their \\"cured\\" side.  The book had entirely too much sympathy to the idea that the Bible, etc... ancient manuscripts were actually works of science.  That is simply not the case.  I've seen people trying to find evidence of understanding of evolution in the Bible, but it's pure fabrication because it's not there.    I'm afraid with this book, Dan Brown has lost a reader. I did like the Da Vinci code, Angels and Demons, Digital Fortress, and Deception Point, but after this book, I can say firmly that I will never pick up another DB book again.
B002VLNB1Q|2.0|Having listened to John Mayer early on before he became a brand name, I found his musical blend of boy-next-door meets angst-ridden boy-wonder infectious and, at times, mesmerizing. These traits simmered on Heavier Things, then crystallized on Continuum--an album that pushed Mayer's image and creative stamp into the realm of &#34;mature artist.&#34;  That said, I was curious as to what degree Mayer's current romance, coupled with his now trademark smart-aleck celebrity stance, would exert influence upon this latest batch of songs and their final presentation on the new recording.  Sweet, sugary, and over-produced: These are the adjectives that swirl across my mind as I listen to the new Mayer product. Many, many knobs were turned on the mastering console.  Nevertheless, the songs themselves are often plodding and tend to float somewhere between &#34;tired&#34; and &#34;sleep-inducing.&#34;  Of course, Mayer's wind-swept visage gazing into the distance while gripping his lapels is obviously intended to brand this album as &#34;big,&#34; &#34;deep,&#34; and &#34;important.&#34;  But there's nothing that serious going on here.  And speaking of nothing, dragging Taylor Swift into this affair appears to have nothing to do with artistic integrity (her voice finally discernible around 2:42 into &#34;Half of My Heart&#34; and then only for about three seconds), but is rather another obvious ploy to ride the latest teen gravy-train and grab a new market share. As has been previously mentioned, &#34;Assassin&#34; is probably the stand out song of the collection, sounding like a foster child of Continuum.  When an album begins with orchestral stirrings, it's either designed as an aural cue for &#34;classic&#34; or as a cover-up for &#34;kitsch.&#34;  Unfortunately, I have to go with the latter.
B002AF4Y9G|3.0|This movie was a real letdown.  Not at all as described at Wikipedia.  :-(    Only good point was when they decapitated Tommy Lee Jones' character.  LOL    Not nearly violent enough.
B002QEXN2K|2.0|The problem with Continuum was that it was such an amazing album, that we got so many amazing tracks that were either fun, catchy, or meaningful. Stop This Train, Slow Dancing in a Burning Room, The Heart of Love, I Don't Trust Myself, Gravity, are all songs that get excessive repeat value from me. Now, all we're left with is a CD full of boring drones called \\"Battle Studies\\".<br /><br />But that's not to say I didn't like this album. I liked some tracks. \\"Who Says\\" is a ballsy track from Johnny, \\"Heartbreak Warfare\\" is a great album opener, \\"Edge of Desire\\" is amazing IMO. There were a few other tracks on here too that I liked that I can't remember (the album is not very memorable IMHO). The rest is all \\"Meh\\". And \\"Crossroads\\"???? Please, Johnny, PLEASE don't do crap like that Chris Cornell's \\"Scream\\"-esque garbage ever again!!!<br /><br />In short, it's not a bad album, but pretty boring, and unfortunately I don't think it will be taking any more spins in my CD player in the coming months...
0439023483|4.0|Hunger Games is one of the rare books you read and can't help but love, whether you are an adult or child. It is largely the story of 16-year-old Katniss who lives in a totalitarian state where the people are kept in check by threatened devastation, starvation, and brutality. In lesser hands it could come off as bleak and tired, but Collins is able to keep the dark themes from getting too dark while moving the story along nicely.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|oh, it's pg-13!  ya, didnt really care for that 4 second  scene with Kirk and the Green Girl anyways.  I wanted spacecraft ACTION!!!  And, i was NOT dissappointed.  my roommate really talked up the movie the other night and apparently he blew a load in his pants! then I watched the movie and blew a load for myself!! it's really that good. ok, im a huge JJ fan, love LOST, so im biased but i did feel the movie was pieced together fantastically so.  I like how JJ got so addicted to shaking the camera's and his addiction to glare heightened the visual presences of the spaceship scenes.  watch this film, maybe bring an extra pair of pants!
B002LBGBR2|5.0|the cd comes with all the songs from i am sasha fierce plus bonus songs. it also comes with a dvd with all the videos from i am sasha fierce except video phone. if your a beyonce fan you will love this cd
B002HWRYJE|4.0|I enjoyed this film in general.  Unlike many Trek fans, I did not have a problem with the pace or some of the upgrades.  I felt that these were no different than when they changed the appearance of the Klingons in the early films.  They simply had more technology and a bigger budget.      I liked the fact that the film was not all about technology - that like all of the television series, it centered on the relationships of the characters.  I felt that the actors did a good job in portraying each character.  I especially liked Karl Urban's portrayal of Dr. McCoy.  It was almost like watching a young Deforest Kelley.  I also really liked Simon Pegg's portrayal of Mr. Scott.  However, I did have some problems with how the characters were written.  Even in an alternate universe, some things were just not acceptable.  First, was it really necessary for Kirk to get into so many fist fights?  This got a bit boring after awhile.  Second, I realize that Spock is half human and that this is a young Spock, but no way would he have had such an emotional relationship with Uhuru.  I could see Kirk in this kind of a relationship with Uhuru, but not Spock.  With all the emotion that Spock had in this film, why even bother to make him a Vulcan?  And the Checkov character was really unacceptable.  Chekov was late coming to the series.  He was very young then.  At that time, Kirk was in his 30's.  There is NO WAY that Kirk and Chekov would have been at the Academy together.  Chekov was portrayed as a Russian Wesley Crusher - the young, eager ensign with all the answers.  And what about Uhuru?  it seemed like for the most part, she was just there for some romantic relief.  They mentioned her ability with languages.  She did replace the communications officer because of her expertise with the Romulan language, but then they never let her character do anything with it.  Her role was just fluff.    Despite all of this, I did enjoy the movie.  I liked seeing Kirk, the wild child in his convertible, I loved the reaction of the old Spock when he first saw Kirk and the resurrection of the line, \\"I have been and always shall be your friend.\\"  I loved every scene with Bones McCoy and Montgomery Scott and wished there had been more. I felt like one of the other reviewers that even though there were some problems with this film, it was still like seeing an old friend after a long time.     I must also mention the score.  I loved the way they used music during the battle scenes instead of just having the usual sound effects.  This was very creative and artistic.     I hope they make a sequel.  I hope that in it Spock is a lot more Vulcan.  Chekov is played down a bit.  Uhuru is more of a professional and less a love interest.  And I hope that somehow, through the magic of time travel, they manage to revive the planet Vulcan and Spock's mother.
1595141715|5.0|I finished this book this morning.  I had been awake for 24 hours straight, but I had to stay awake one more hour to finish it.  After I was done, I was literally shattered.    Make no mistake, this story of a young girl who had committed suicide mailing tapes to the 13 people who most affected her life up to that point, and who in one way or another may have contributed to her decision to take that life, is not a FUN read.  It's harsh, bitter, and sad; more than once I found myself saying aloud \\"Oh, no.  Oh, don't.  Oh, God.\\"  Each chapter is just one blow right after another, and sometimes, it's wise to stop reading and take a step back.    So, in light of that, why do I say you need to run, not walk, to your nearest bookstore or hit that Buy button right now?  Everyone - adult and teen - (and I'm 32) needs to read this book.  We all know what it's like to be a teenager, or to have been a teenager, or, simply, to be human.  And we don't realize how our actions, how simple things such as rumors or misunderstandings, can affect a person.  Or how one person can make us think, \\"I wish I'd said this.  I wish I'd done this...\\"  As Hannah reveals her story, one name per tape, 13 steps at a time, it comes together; it literally snowballs.  12 stars on a map, 12 hurts, 12 reasons to give up.  And 1 reason for hope, 1 chance lost, 1 star drawn and filled in red... almost like a heart.    For those reviewers who say don't buy this book because Hannah takes no accountability for her own decision to die, and blames others... well, of course.  She's a young woman who has lost all hope.  This is what makes a person suicidal, not rational, unable to see how their own choices are contributing to their misery.  It's curious to me that the reviewers are reacting in many ways similar to  how SPOILER SPOILER Hannah's classmates did in the book  SPOILER SPOILER.  And the book does a goob job of showing how her suicide has affected everyone; even the absence of her parents in the novelis telling.    Anyway, don't just listen to what I'm saying.  Read the book.  If you're not changed by it, well... I'm sure you'll have more than 13 reasons why.
B0014BEDBG|5.0|Justin Timberlake is awesome and an absolute amazing entertainer.  It is extremely enjoyable and far better than any of his other concerts on DVD.  Great gift for anyone who loves Justin Timberlake or for any teenage girl because they will grow to love Justin Timberlake and be addicited.
B002RSDW80|3.0|... and nothing more. But sometimes that's enough, like a cold Sam Adams when the only other beer on tap is Coors or Budweiser. KLM offers dozens of films on its trans-Atlantic flights, but most of them are Harry Potter I-VI or GI Joe Cobra in various combinations of language and subtitles. Thus it happens that I felt rather benign about this rather flimsy concoction of a film. I was hoping for a strongly-spiced \\"food movie\\" on a par with Stanley Tucci's 'The Big Night'. Tucci plays a long in 'Julie and Julia' but his part is as bland as the mixed vegetables in a steakhouse. Julie and Julia is NOT a food movie; it's a sentimental feel-good marriage-crisis movie about Julie, interspersed with a Saturday Night Live spoof of Julia Child.<br /><br />Meryl Streep is killingly funny as Julia Child, but her performance is pure parody. There's no story to it - not that a story is required - and there's precious little 'food' for thought. A minor surprise is delivered when, at the end of the film, a phone caller tells Julie that Julia doesn't entirely thrill to her fingertips at being exploited for her fame. That surprise remains unexamined.<br /><br />The real story is Julie's, about Julie, and \\"it's all about Julie\\" in Julie's world. I suspect a generation gap appears in my reaction to sweet little Julie and her navel-gazing blog-to-fame. I found her to be an annoying twit. I would have felt quite sorry for hunky hubby, except that he had no personality to feel sorry for. The two tales here - of Julie's marriage and of Julia's education of French cooking - are shuffled together with a minimum of cinematic artistry. All I can really offer is the advice that, if your choice on your next flight is J&J or Harry Potter VII.5, go for J&J.
0446579939|2.0|Sorry, but this book is boring.  I discovered this about Spark's books after reading the first 8.  The 9th book made me think I would never read another of his books.  I felt he had run out of ideas.  My neighbor loaned me this book and another of his latest.  I couldn't say I didn't want to read them.   I skipped through the whole middle section - reading only the first sentence of each paragraph.  I felt like I was reading the transcript of someone's boring, everyday conversation. The last chapter was exciting but sad in that one person had to die.  Another reviewer mentioned that this book was reminiscent of \\"Message in a Bottle\\".  Precisely what I thought!

B002LL13AM|5.0|I've been waiting for several decades to hear Pollini play the WTC, which he began to include on programs in the 1970s but has never played in my hometown of Boston. The thing about this WTC is that it is unlike any other you've ever heard, including Gould, Gulda, Richter, Schepkin, Schiff, Hewitt, Fellner, Ashkenazy, Aldwell, Barenboim, Tureck, and Fischer.  There is a remarkable purity about it - a humility and directness borne of wisdom and utterly free of egoic adornment - that distinguishes it from other renderings. Pollini transcends any sort of technical limitation whatsoever in these pieces, yet is uncommonly spare both in ornament and artifice, allowing the almost unbearable intensity of Bach's vision to thrill, challenge, and astound. As one who has played and studied the 48 for many a decade, I must say that until hearing this recording I never came close to grasping many of Bach's inner structures, Pollini's subtly absorbing way with polyphony notwithstanding.  Nothing is underlined or over-emphasized, but the clarity with which Bach's counterpoint unfolds is simply amazing.  I realize now that the technical and expressive priorities of other interpreters have colored my sense of what these pieces are, and what they might have meant to Bach.  Wait until you hear the austere grandeur of the E minor prelude & fugue...the ecstasy of the F and G majors...the desolation of the Bb minors! Regardless of the many treasures in the Bach keyboard catalogue, I can say with certainty that I will always cherish and return to this luminous achievement, another landmark in the testament of one of our greatest musical visionaries.

B000A2RRF4|5.0|I had never seen a Michael Jackson Concert or been a fan when he was at the top but I always thought he was a shy, misunderstood person and followed the stories about him and his family. It was a shock to learn of his death. He was so talented, a great humanitarian, humble, gentle, and loving. He left a great legacy to the world. This DVD shows Michael in top form, a master of performance, a truly remarkable musician and dancer. I could watch it over and over. The only part I thought could be eliminated was all the girls that passed out and had to be carried away.
B002GZQY6Q|1.0|Well, Porcupine Tree really have made a name for themselves, now haven't they?  Through  twenty plus years of no-compromise persistence their brand of proggy psychedelic pop metal has become an international phenomenon.  On \\"The Incident\\", however, it seems the world renowned brain rockers have said yes to compromise.<br /><br />I should have known the album would fall well below expectations by the cover alone.  A blurry hand in front of a face is lukewarm stuff coming from the guys who gave us that weird blue head and the burning piano in the sky.  Upon first listen my impression was not disgust but static ambivalence; the music immediately turned to background music and my own boring thoughts became more exciting.  In all honesty, the album is dull.  The closest comparison I can make for it is bad alternative FM radio rock.  Wilson and company have given us such eloquent beauty in the past, have invested deep into the concepts of their work, and with their latest release I hear a bunch of musical thoughts loosely strung together with filler riffs.<br /><br />This album must have been rushed. As stated above, it doesn't seem like they invested much into what was going to be the end product.  The boys came up with half of a few ideas, went into the studio, and did an uninspired job welding those ideas together.  Also, the production (from a band who has all but one letter of the word production in their name) is below average.  The mixing is off the mark, giving the album a tinny quality.  I don't hear anything lush, never does any instrument seem to stand alone nor do they ever mesh very well.<br /><br />Supposedly The Incident is one long piece of music...I don't hear it, I hear fourteen or fifteen individual but indistinct tracks.  The first pseudo-song, \\"Blind House\\", features the agonizingly drawn out \\"freeee-love\\" chant chorus which never quite makes me want to sing along.  \\"Drawing the Line\\" has a boring chorus as well, one which sounds like it should be in a very different song. There is an occasional cool guitar lick or drum pattern, but nothing that can salvage the whole mess.  The title track is kinda cool, the NINspired electronic opening shows potential as do the terse riffage, but alas it is no \\"Arriving Somewhere\\", so forgive me if I have expectations.<br /><br />And then there is \\"Time Flies\\", which I suppose is the epic centerpiece of the album...this of course is an album architecture that PT have mastered with \\"Anesthesize\\" and \\"Arriving Somewhere but Not Here\\", but \\"Time Flies\\" is far less engaging than those works, in fact, it sucks.  My fourteen year old self calls it gay.  The opening lines of \\"I was born in '67 / The year of \\"Seargeant Peppers\\" / And \\"Are You Experienced?\\" are so lame.  I'm sick of references to these guys, talk about Grand Funk or Tangerine Dream.  It is all a rambling mess from there, sounding like Wilson is making the words up as he goes along. \\"But after a while.... you realize, uh...time flies..!\\", are you singing me a song or about to pass down an old family heirloom?<br /><br />Porcupine Tree's long stylistic evolution is as follows: strange bedroom psych rock, kraut-trance, progressive album rock for the '90's, heavy dream pop, prog-metal, and now it seems as though they were leaning towards something less metallic but no less dark.  The overall picture, in my ears, is just kind of boring.  The dynamic is not there, the production is muddy, and it simply does not come across as a single piece of music.<br />But this  is OK.  A band can have a boring patch, and with Porcupine Tree's close to twenty years of stellar output, I know that this album is probably, hopefully, just a LONG overdue bad album from which they will recover.  Mr. Wilson seems to work on ten projects at once, I think it was probably hard to focus on what Porcupie Tree would sound like in 2009 with so many third party musical ideas floating around in his British head.<br /><br />If you have $15 bucks to spend,I advise you to put down \\"The Incident\\", go to the W section and pick up Steven Wilson's excellent 2009 release \\"Insurgentes\\".go to the W section and pick up Steven Wilson's excellent 2009 release \\"Insurgentes\\".
0307716988|5.0|I loved this book. Michael didn't like the public to know alot about his private life but this book gives insight into his humanism, his fears, failures, and triumphs. It was written before he went into semi seclusion, dropping out of the spotlight.  He was a genious who was misunderstood as most of his caliber are. He drew on his talent to create music, dance,and performances of new dimensions. It makes me feel sorrow for his tragic end.   If you are a fan of Michael or just curious about him, this is a must read book.
0545123267|2.0|I was soo excited to read this book, it was so popular and got great reviews. Unfortunately, I dont agree with those reviews. So, I'm not even done with this book (I think I'm on like, 117) and it's completely and utterly boring. I wanna scratch my eyes out over Grace and Sam. The book started off really good, with the whole, \\"I recognized his yellow eyes,\\" but then it went down hill. Their relationship was tolerable when Sam was a wolf, but the book falls to pieces once he's a human. First off, if both Sam and Grace are around the same age, then they first met each other when they were about...six maybe. Idk, I can't remember. And the author writes that Sam believed she was the most beautiful person he'd ever seen. That doesn't happen! If he was like five, he's not going to have any interest in a beautiful girl whose even younger than he. Boys at that age think girls have cooties. And supposedly, they were in love from that point on...blah blah blah. And that's when the book is tolerable!   It's all a totally different when Sam turns to human. I can't stand Sam's viewpoint, as I prefer the female's. Their relationship is disgusting! So, Grace finds him wounded and takes him to the hospital. They go home, she invites him to bed (idk why...it all felt so rushed that she makes the point of him going straight to her bed when she's only been with him a couple hours) then the next day they kiss for the first time. It's like, rush much? I haven't even fallen into the lives of these characters yet! I really wanted to smack both of them. At least Bella and Edward waited a couple days, but no...these two get right to it. And then from there, when I don't think thigs could get an lower, they turn into one big happy couple, and it's soo sweet, I wanna spit it out. The two of them are so awkward and then its so sappy. Then from there on, NOTHING happens. They talk about their emotions and memories and every movement they make. Uhhh...its boring me to tears. Wish I had saved mymoney for another book, as you should too. This is nothing compared to Twilight.
0743289692|5.0|This is a great, well-written book.  I totally loved it.  A number of years ago a book came out about some saudi arabian princess who fled to the west (leaving her DAUGHTER!) which was obvious BS.  No mother would leave their DAUGHTER and take their SON out of saudi arabia. It sucked, much of it rang as being untrue, it was simplified and obviously created for the paperback market. BUT my mom and all her friends were really INTO this book and swore up and down it was true and it went on and on - it was aggravating.  After some time my mom came to her senses though (she is a trial attorney after all)  and now that I have read this book, I passed it onto her because it is a terrific, well-written, thoughtful account of the life of a girl growing to be a woman in a heavily Islamic area (including an account of Saudi Arabia, I might add).  It rings true, it was a fantastic book and easy to read (and difficult to put down).     In addition, it was very interesting to me because as the book progresses, you come to know about the recent history in Somalia which is very interesting in and of itself.    What I really liked about the authour is she's ballsy!  She shows up in some foreign place without speaking the language and knowing her family's gonna be pissed and she goes for it anyway.  She's discouraged at every step from going to University but she gets in and does it.  She's a great lady and even better, what she says is very controversial - these radical Muslem types have put out a death warrant for her so what she has to say is especially interesting for this reason alone.  A wonderful critique that changed my mind about Islam, women's rights, and the hazards of being PC.

B002I9Z8I0|4.0|\\"Theatrical releases\\".    We FINALLY get Trek VI in the proper 2.35:1 ratio.  AND the original cut, as the inserted bits only turn a benign President into a double-dealing creep unworthy of the Federation.  (not to mention the 2-disc \\"Director's Cut\\" release, which changes even more around, including the mind meld scene to the point the emotive effect is lost.)    We FINALLY get \\"The Motion Picture\\" in original form, warts and all.  The special DVD release prior to this one has CGI f/x that are rather good, but replacing an understandably repetitive computer voice with this cheap voice and klaxon -- no way was the director involved with that change; it's horrible.  Ditto for hacking up a few scenes that didn't need to be truncated...    \\"Khan\\" definitely shows a proper film cleanup job, even on standard-def.    The other movies look and sound great, especially for being standard-def releases!  These cuts came were minted from the same masters used for the Blu-ray sets, so we won't notice any negative differences, but Blu-ray users will.  Go read their reviews:  Blu-ray users are right in being disappointed in that only \\"Khan\\" was given the full restoration and the others given half-baked, upconverted \\"remastering\\" treatment.  (Tangential question:  Did Generation-Y do the work for all of these new releases?  They're all said to be lazy...  Assuming the work was done by Americans, in this global day and age AND where \\"'good enough' is good enough\\" is just good enough, it can be done by anybody anywhere and if people don't care, a poor quality product is the result.  But that's the gripe for the blu-ray set and not relevant here.  Since the resolution isn't being upconverted, the problems there don't apply.  :-D  )      All in all, this is a fine release for people not desiring to go blu-ray or at least until blu-ray players are affordable and when Paramount can put out all 6 movies in a format that natively makes the best use OF blu-ray, which for now is only \\"Khan\\"that will.  Even if you've bought all the other sets, these do look and sound better, and were what were shown in the movie theaters to begin with.  Theatrical purists will indeed love this set.
B00023BLV2|3.0|In all fairness to the director, this was probably excitingly shocking material with an edge back when it was made.    In today's vastly superior technical on-location filming world, this all but screams, 'inexpensive college-level video production.'    Even that wouldn't be so bad given the wealth of acting talent--'A' actors, several at the early stages of their careers--but the transfer to dvd is simply ABYSMAL.
156895963X|4.0|My father gave this to me awhile ago and I recently passed that copy to his brother at my dad's funeral.  My father and his sister found strong similarities in McCourt's book to their Irish Catholic childhood in Boston.  And I found much of my father in this book, perhaps not the abject poverty but the hard life, the Catholic school severity and many of the sayings, language and attitudes, even the alcoholism, especially the alcoholism.    It's a great tale of overcoming adversity, with humor so poignant to be laugh out loud and done so well as a first person child [Frank as a youth].  We root for Frankie and he does not disappoint.  The language is raw and the narrative pure, he relates the ugliness in life and his own adaptive nature; perhaps that's why it succeeds despite some of the controversy it stirred up.      Thank you McCourt for the insight into a childhood of hardship and adversity as well as into my father's own life.    When I asked my uncle at the funeral about their tough childhood and poverty, he said, \\"We were mobile, we realized we didn't have to stay in this life.  We could move.\\"  And they did.      As Frank also does.      Painful, insighful and relevant.  I took over a decade to get around to reading this and my father's demise, so I found it is particularly meaningful.
B001F12J48|1.0|Speaking about 3D portion only... I bought the standard 3D version of the movie... not the blue ray version. Within minutes we had to shut it off. The images are distorted. There are terrible shadows around the chraracters and objects. The glasses are made of paper, with red on the left eye, and blue on the right. The colors of the movie are distorted from the glasses. A complete waste of time and money. Tried this movie on two different televsions, and with two different DVD players.  Rip off.

Whether you're a Trekkie or not--I'm not--your going to love this one.<br />Along with all the extras you actually get a well made special effects flick with quality actors, witty dialogue,<br />and a well rounded and fully satisfying storyline. It all comes together for the trekkie.
B00000AFWZ|5.0|Mono is exactly what I want from these relics. I had many of these singles during the day and enjoyed most of them either from my transistor radio or VW Van cassette system, when I wasn't playing them on my Sears, Roebuck & Co. record player. Rhino couldn't have done better for my ears. For example, I A/B'd Paul Revere & the Raider's stereo version of Steppin' Out from their Sony Collection to Rhino's mono remastering genius. No comparison. Rhino certainly realized it could have remastered in stereo, but opted for the 'black and white' editions over their 'colorized' counterparts. When Rhino went through the remastering process to deliver these goods to us Nuggetheads, they, no doubt, considered everything. I mean, the precision with which Rhino chose to package the glorious booklet that compliments the set, alone, speaks for itself and is a clear indication of just how detail oriented Rhino actually is. Consequently, \\"original artyfacts\\" (artifacts) is precisely what's been released - a batch of objet d'art. Rhino knew exactly what it was doing with these gems when buying the licensing rights. Rhino does not cut corners! These versions bring back some real groovy ear candy for me, and the packaging is far out, man...right down to the hip replica CD labels Rhino cleverly copped as a tribute, not a rip-off! It's totally hip. As always, Rhino comes through again!
1440471045|5.0|The first time I read Siddhartha, the classic by Hermann Hesse about a Sixth Century Brahmin's search for Enlightenment, I was a typical brain-dead hippy--a teenaged Romantic with murky ideas about the way the world actually works, to put it mildly.  I liked the book then and I still like it decades later, but I see it differently now. Siddhartha's a great book and well worth reading, but I think you have to be a certain mental age to take it seriously. Romanticism appeals to the young and inexperienced. When you get older, writers like Hesse start to lose their appeal.<br /><br />The book tells the story of Siddhartha, the son of a wealthy Brahmin, who forsakes the world in a quest for Illumination--the annihilation of the illusory Self and union with the One. He joins a band of forest ascetics who practice a masochistic form of self-denial similar to that of the Medieval Christian Flagellants: fasting, exposing themselves to extremes of weather and meditating in an attempt to kill sensation and rise above the attachments of the flesh. Later, Siddhartha experiments with the profane world, giving himself over to the pleasures of the senses only to grow jaded after a few years of high living. He heads back to the forest and meets Guatama, the Buddha, but decides to follow his own path, eventually discovering the secret of the Holy OM as a simple ferryman living on the bank of a river.<br /><br />This is a good story told in a clear, simple style, but searching for enlightenment doesn't really grab me anymore. If you gave me the choice between enlightenment and a million dollars, I wouldn't even have to think about it. Just give me the cash. These days, it's hard not to see a character like Siddhartha as a kind of Medieval Flower Child and eastern mysticism in general seems tame and naive compared to the organic mysticism of writers like Goethe, Spengler and Schopenhauer--all Germans like Hesse, but miles above him in intellect.<br /><br />Having said all that, I've got to admit that I've always liked Hinduism, an ancient religion with roots in the Vedic traditions of the Indo-Aryans who migrated into northern India sometime during the Iron Age or Bronze Age, depending on which source you read. Schopenhauer was heavily influenced by Indian philosophy, particularly the Vedas, and his masterpiece The World As Will And Representation could be called Hinduism translated via Kant into Western metaphysics. If Schopenhauer took Hinduism seriously, that's good enough for me, so I've got mixed feelings when it comes to Hesse. On the one hand, he was tapping into a profound, ancient and sophisticated tradition. On the other hand, his stuff mostly appeals to college freshmen who still think there's something \\"spiritual\\" about poverty.<br /><br />Personally, I can't shake this image of Siddhartha as a kind of upper-class hippy. The son of a wealthy aristocrat, he never had to work for a living--except as a kind of game--and he had the nobility's disdain for the lower orders. He voluntarily adopted a life of poverty and self-denial in his quest to find Nirvana and the key word here is \\"voluntary.\\" In a way, he was a typical product of the Brahman elite, a rich kid indulging the very ego he was trying to destroy.<br /><br />It's hard not to see all this in terms of economics. The culture of wandering mystics, beggar monks and forest ascetics described in the book formed a leisure class which could only exist in an affluent society with enough disposable income to keep them alive. Siddhartha would have starved to death in a few weeks if not for the farmers, merchants and all the rest of the ordinary people lost in Samsara, the endless cycle of birth, death and rebirth driven by karma and avidya, the ignorance of one's true self that leads to what the rest of us call ordinary consciousness.<br /><br />Siddhartha was a business man at one point, but for most of his life, he was a professional beggar who pitied the very people who kept him alivewith their charity. Seen from this perspective, he was an arrogant social parasite and his detachment from ordinary human life was almost sociopathic. For example, after his experiment with material pleasures, he simply walked away from his friends, business partner and lover (leaving her pregnant, though he didn't know that at the time) without saying a word to anyone. This wasn't exactly the picture of compassion, but compassion had very little to do with Siddhartha's program of Self-Realization. These people had served their purpose. It was time to discard them and head back to the forest.<br /><br />Ironically, Siddhartha's quest to annihilate the Self was itself a form of self-absorption. If I understand the philosophy described here, our sense of individual consciousness is an illusion born out of our ignorance of our true nature. This veil of illusion--the Hindus called it Maya--keeps us from seeing that we are all one in the finite, impersonal reality called Brahman, locking us into the cycle of karma, reincarnation and endless suffering. Siddhartha was following the traditional path of meditation and self-denial in an attempt to \\"forget himself,\\" so to speak, but it's hard to forget yourself when all your attention is focused on yourself.<br /><br />None of this is fair to the book, of course. I'm seeing it from a 21st Century American perspective muddled by my own experience and Hesse was describing a way of life that existed over a thousand years ago. Siddhartha is both profound and hopelessly Romantic, but it's still a great novel by a great German writer, a real classic.

B000AARKOO|5.0|I've got mixed feelings about Ridley Scott's Medieval epic Kingdom of Heaven. On the one hand, it's a great movie and I've probably watched it half a dozen times so far. On the other hand, it seems like just another Hollywood propaganda film loaded with the same old \\"progressive\\" drivel we've been hearing for decades now. In this case, the message is pretty simple: organized religion is bad; multiculturalism is good. Luckily, the movie's good enough to make it worth watching despite the propaganda.    Briefly, Kingdom of Heaven tells the story of Balian, a blacksmith in France who joins his crusader father in the Holy Land, seeking forgiveness for murdering a priest and redemption for his wife who committed suicide. Knighted by his dying father, Balian enters the service of Baldwin, the leper king of Jerusalem, and ends up defending the city from a siege by the Muslims under Saladin after Baldwin dies and the Templars start a war under the new king, the evil Guy of Lusignan.    The movie presents Catholics as greedy, scheming, hypocritical, cowardly and strategically inept war-mongers who justify their atrocities as the \\"will of God.\\" Muslim leaders like Saladin, on the other hand, along with pure knights like Balian, are shown as noble, enlightened types struggling to sustain a multicultural \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" in Jerusalem where everybody lives side by side in joyful harmony regardless of race, creed, religion, blah, blah, blah. As usual, the forces of enlightenment and tolerance are surrounded by the forces of darkness--the evil Templars in particular. The Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon get a very bad rap in this flick.    Now, I'm no fan of the Catholic Church and I don't know enough about the Crusades (yet) to say if any of this is historically accurate, but I really doubt if Twelfth Century Jerusalem was ruled by politically-correct liberals and it's hard to believe that Saladin was all that interested in living in peace and harmony with the Christian invaders. The not-so-hidden message in Kingdom of Heaven is basically just your standard \\"progressive liberalism\\" and New World Order multiculturalism dressed up in Medieval armor. In this sense, the movie seems completely ahistorical, a good example of Hollywood projecting its values onto the past.    Having said all that, however, I've got to admit that I really like this flick. Ridley Scott's a good director and there are moments in Kingdom of Heaven which achieve a real suspension of disbelief. Balian's suicidal cavalry charge in front of Raynald's castle; the coronation of Guy of Lusignan; the opening scenes in France; the funeral of King Baldwin, the leper: All of these scenes have a Medieval feel about them which makes Kingdom of Heaven one of the better historical movies I've seen. Ridley Scott (as usual) gets carried away with CGI effects--the armies are bigger, the siege machines more powerful than they could ever have been in real life--but the battle scenes are well done for the most part, very violent and grisly at times. You can preach Tolerance all you like, but people come for the battles. Movie violence is the Twenty-First Century equivalent of the gladiatorial games and Kingdom of Heaven delivers lots of blood and action.    The movie didn't do as well as it should have when it first came out, mostly, I think, because people saw it as \\"pro-Muslim\\" or at least pushing a message of tolerance towards Muslims which ran counter to the official anti-Muslim propaganda pouring out of Washington and the mainstream media at the time.  To make things worse, the theatrical release apparently cut a lot of material which developed the background and made the themes more clear. To be fair to Ridley Scott, the studios forced him to cut the original movie from 194 minutes down to two hours, so over an hour of footage is missing in the original release, which is the only version I've seen so far. In any case, it's worth checking out. Just be aware that many of the values expressed in Kingdom of Heaven have more to do with Twentieth Century Hollywood than Medieval Jerusalem.

So I rented it and I loved it.<br />The story was great, the cinema photography was great, the special effects & just the visuals were great..but on top of that there is some really great acting and a story thrown in to boot. This is steps above the mindless put your brain to rest mindless explosion films that we usually get these days.<br />This film was everything Transformers Revenge of the Fallen & GI Joe should have been. Those movies went for either toilet humor or smart-ass been there done that attitudes..<br />This movie has characters that we can care about. The Capt. Kirk , Spock and the whole crew of today actually had personality, which a lot of movies such as this have been lacking. You want Kirk to succeed in defeating Nero, you want Spock & Kirk to get on the same page. Zachary Quinto was great as Mr. Spock ! JJ Abrams did a great directing job as you can tell he was really , REALLY into making this a blockbuster..<br />What is great about this movie is you need not watch the old TV show youre not fan or any of the earlier Star Trek films. I watched this as a 'stand alone' film and it paid off big time for me. This is the kind of film that should get a sequel, but if not, the Star Trek movie franchise can end on a very high note.<br />This was a fun ride for 2 hours, with the outer space battles , Kirk being chased around by some really cool creatures & well, i hope this doesn't count as a spoiler but Leonard Nimoy does play an important role in this as well.<br />I can confidently highly recommend this movie, not just for die hard Star Trek trekkies, but for those that want to see a good science fiction action film that takes itself seriously, which is very unlike a lot today's science fiction movies. There are some funny and amusing moments but this is not a comedy or shot in bad taste to insult the franchise...<br />The 2 disc DVD is the way to go with tons of bonus features...not just on the first disc but a whole entire disc with lots of supplements...plus an audio commentary...just a great movie and DVD release..<br />Brilliant film !whole entire disc with lots of supplements...plus an audio commentary...just a great movie and DVD release..  Brilliant film !
B000MAH5O2|5.0|In reading this book I wanted to gain an insight into what makes Obama click, I have heard his speeches, listened to cable news shows say positive and negative things about him, but I wanted to get a new perspective. I enjoyed reading this book because it looked at both sides of the political spectrum, liberal and conservative, and tried to come up with his own explanation into why we are where we are today. Now, it comes from the eyes of a life long democrat, and he explains this in the beginning, but he tries to explain how, for instance, Reagan has such a big influence in today's Republican party. He also describes the Democrats as being sometimes confused with some still not adapting to decade political shifts and how some still preach the New Deal ideals. In all, if you want to get a good perspective into 21st century American Politics from the viewpoint of an objective democrat, then this is a highly recommended read.
0316044938|5.0|You know I get it, McGrath, I do understand why you hated Alice Sebold's masterpiece The Lovely Bones.  Most of my reviews don't personally go after another review but this time I just had to take exception.  In the one star review entitled \\"What they read in hell?\\" I would like to counter argue each point he makes with a valid point of my own.  I believe that most great novels in the world are either loved or hated.  Most of the in between novels are just forgotten...and everyone knows the novels that just plain suck.  It's the books that trigger fierce debate, such as masterpieces like Uncle Tom Cabin, Of Mice and Men or The Lord of the Flies and numerous others. Depending on your own personal beliefs, The Lovely Bones is such a novel.  I believe over time it will endure and become another classic in modern American literature.    The first thing McGrath says in his review is: the book is sentimental and unoriginal.  He needs to keep in mind that this is told from the point of view of a young teen girl that has just been murdered.  Of course she is going to miss her family and many memories are going to be shared.  This book at times is dark and brutal and at other times light and optimistic.  It takes us through whole gauntlet of emotions.  Be warned, this book will drain you.  This completely original character has just gone through puberty where emotions run high in adolescents.    She was killed in a traumatic way which only adds to her pain inside.  Despite her pain, this is not a character that asks for our pity or wants it. She is likeable, interesting and complex. I found this book remarkably straight forward and unsentimental at times.  I don't think it's possible for you to put yourself in the mind of a 14 year old but somehow I really felt as if I knew her by the end and she became very real for me.    McGrath makes another joke about how smart all the characters all are, the teen ones anyway.  One of the aspects of this book is that it's trying to makeus understand that sometimes children with their innocence and lack of cynicism can be more brave and smart at times than even adults can be.    He complained about the murderer being cold, lonely and single.  Duh.  I think a lot of pedophiles are that way and I felt the savage evil beast he was just as vividly as any villain I have ever encountered.  While his death might be a bit unrealistic, this is a fantasy reality story narrated by a dead girl in heaven. The readers deserved a just end for him after all his horrendous acts, but the author cleverly gave us an ending for him we didn't expect.   This book is not for everybody, of course, but I thought the fantasy elements in the novel were melancholy and stunning, mixing horrific everyday life tragedy with the spiritually sublime elements of the afterlife with ease and power.      McGrath states that the police are very diligent but just can't seem to figure out what is going on with the investigation.  First off, how intelligent are the detectives when a father's instinct turns out to be correct and during the most pivotal moment in the investigation the detective commits a despicable act which lets the murderer walk free because of his absence.  The reader needs to keep in mind the time line of the story when they read this book.  This story took place in the 70's.  There was no CSI back then on the murder scene to investigate the forensic evidence found.  Back then without cold hard proof you had nothing.  A story like this would not be realistic thirty years later in today's world. And besides, the detective was an unfocused character and ultimately a failure.  That is part of Sebold's story.  Does McGrath think that every missing girl murder back in the 70's was solved? I'm eerily sure that there were cases pretty much just like this back then that didn't get solved either.  I didn't find the investigation unrealistic at all, even though the core of this book is really about the unraveling of Susie's familyin the wake of the murder.  Also, the narrator is a voyeur, so in hindsight everything seems obvious to us because we are told the tale by the all knowing.    Finally, and this is not McGraths complaint but it is the novels most mentioned and controversial point.  In her brief moments on earth, Susie Salmon chooses to have sex with her crush rather than do something important.  Many people wonder why a girl that has been assaulted would even think about something like that with her precious moments left.  This is only my opinion on why it works but I can understand some skepticism about it.  This is a very unusual scene that bothered me at first but the more I thought about it, the more I realized why it was there and that it needed to be.  Through the whole ordeal, Susie had been looking down on her family.  She saw her mother's adultery.  Her sister's loss of virginity.  And Susie  herself had sex in the cruelest way possible. I think part of her wanted redemption from that act, so she wouldn't always view that act with such sadness and disgust.  I can understand why in all her pain she would want a brief moment of pleasure.  She saw her mother do it and her sister too.  Why didn't she go warn someone?  Well, let's be realistic, most people would think she was crazy if she did that and in the end it might scare and hurt her family more than comfort them. Her father had already gotten in trouble previously for making accusations.  And why didn't she help someone discover the evidence she needed to convict her killer?  Because I think if you were raped you wouldn't want to return to the lair it happened and risk running into your murderer again and then possibly getting your friend raped and murdered in the process because it wasn't your own body you were using.  That's why she didn't go back. Instead, she had a selfish moment for herself...and didn't she deserve it? Shouldn't we just be happy she got to experience some final moment joy, instead of a probable failure she might have caused had she went to the authorities or her family?  Susie was smart and she had thought out all the consequences carefully in her mind before she made this decision.    If McGrath ever does end up reading my counter argument, I hope he knows I mean no hard feelings by it.  It's just one persons opinion against another's.  This book is one of the best novels ever written; sure to make my top ten list.  It's that good. To anyone reading this review, I encourage you to buy this book and form your own opinion on it..The Lovely Bones is certain to either leave you feeling terrible like McGrath or spellbound and overcome with emotion like I was.    Grade: A

B00003CWL6|4.0|Triple entendre? Whatever. First of all, the DVD worked.  Having got that out of the way, I have to say that seeing this film again at 42 (the protagonist's age) left me a little less engaged than I had hoped.  By the second go-around I had accumulated enough existential (and real) pain under my belt to make Spacey's character's travails seem like a walk in the park, but that gave me little satisfaction.  I found myself disappointed that it did not seem a more mature, nuanced film given my new lens.  It's still very good; beautifully shot and cleverly contrived. But make no mistake, it belongs more squarely with the trivial middle-age breakout/revenge fantasy flicks of the world, rather than the fewer in number that seek to truly transcend the deathly mire that seems to be the lot of they typical American middle-aged male. So if you want a kick-ass movie, this one comes up roses.  If you want to know the answer to life, the universe and everything, this one might not be the one. But still worth watching!

Instead, know your enemy very well.\\" Your enemy, Resistance, goes by many names (you'll recognize them all) and every one is a small demon with an Achille's heel. The format of the book is ideal for focus, with chapters of one or two pages each; enough meat to chew and digest, one bite at a time. And it's REAL. No fluffy cheerleading or coddling self-help; no, it's a call to responsibility and clarity. The scales fell from my self-deluded little eyes and my expectations have deflated down to workable dimensions. And I'm writing! Without my usual angst and procrastination and transparent excuses! Give this book to people you love.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Knowning all the hype that was put out about this movie had me very very concerned.  Due to, from past experience, the lack of substance that a movie will have once completed and in theaters.  More times than not a movie with such over hype usually is just a way for studios to try to gain money from the audeince who doesn't know any better and once it is seen it falls away into oblivian. That was my concern about this movie.  That it would suck so bad that it completely destory Batman as a comic book character that has been around since the early 20th century.  Just because studios think that the masses are just dumb sheep who will make a hit out of a movie just because of a lot of advertising was put behind it.      However, I was pleasantly proven wrong about this movie.  What Christpher Nolan did with Batman Begins he built upon in this one.  We see a city still in dispair to the point of breaking.  Yet there is hope on the streets and fear starting emerge in the hearts of criminals, all because of Batman.  Along comes the Joker.  He is a sucidal maniac who wants to prove to the world that it sits on a thin thread between chaos and order.  Thinking that most of society, at its heart, is chaotic is oout to take down the only thing standing between him and complete anarchy, Batman.  To take down the Joker and his diabolical plans Batman, LT. Gordon, and newly appointed D.A.  Harvey Dent team up.  Although, the heroes of this story try to take down the Joker through moral ways he makes it very difficult for them to make the right decision and become a symbol of hope for the city of Gotham.      In the end the movie blew me away and then some.  The script was well written.  The movie was well acted by everyone included. And the moral choices that the characters had to make pushed comic book heroes into the real life that everyone can identify with.
0316035904|4.0|Seven out of the twelve stories in this book have appeared in other books by Sedaris and are reprinted here. The reprinted stories are all his typical non-fiction, commentaries on his life. The other five stories are fiction, and while they are creatively written I don't find them as interesting as Sedaris' true accounts of his own life. The fiction stories are over-the-top ridiculous. They're not bad, just not what I'm used to and not what I expected.<br /><br />Here are the stories:<br />  \\"SantaLand Diaries\\" (from Barrel Fever)<br />  \\"Season's Greetings to Our Friends and Family!!!\\" (fiction)<br />  \\"Front Row Center with Thaddeus Bristol\\" (fiction)<br />  \\"Based Upon a True Story\\" (fiction)<br />  \\"Christmas Means Giving\\" (fiction)<br />  \\"Dinah, the Christmas Whore\\" (from Naked)<br />  \\"Jesus Shaves\\" (from Me Talk Pretty One Day)<br />  \\"Us and Them\\" (from Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim)<br />  \\"Let It Snow\\" (from Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim)<br />  \\"Six to Eight Black Men\\" (from Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim)<br />  \\"The Monster Mash\\" (from When You Are Engulfed in Flames)<br />  \\"The Cow and The Turkey\\" (fiction, new story for this edition)<br /><br />If you want to read something really unusual from Sedaris, namely fiction, then check out this book.

B001G6R96K|4.0|I always loved this live album by Yes-in-all-but-name. The clarity of instruments is wonderful, the crowd is clearly heard and enthusiastic, the sound is raw and live (no overdubs I'm aware of), and the setlist is expertly chosen and played well.<br /><br />It seems strange to open a show with acoustic solo medleys, but that's exactly what they do here. Jon Anderson throws casual 90125 fans a bone by including \\"Owner of a Lonely Heart\\" in between \\"Time And A Word\\" and a short excerpt of \\"Teakbois\\", before Steve Howe comes in with \\"Clap/Mood For A Day\\".

However, this concert contains the *definitive* \\"Starship Trooper\\", with crystal-clear vocals, wonderful harmonies, and the best \\"Wurm\\" outro ever, especially the first minute or so as Wakeman teases the 3-note motif with gorgeous deep keyboards.<br /><br />Different versions of An Evening of Yes Music Plus (gosh, what a dumb title) exist, some containing \\"Starship Trooper\\", while more recent ones include \\"I've Seen all Good People\\".

B0000DZ3EN|5.0|This movie is probably the only live-action (I'm not counting live action/animation)Disney film that is dark, but awesome.  It's more attached to the books than the sugar-coated 1939 version ever was.  If L.Frank Baum was alive in the 1980's, then he would have loved this movie.    (spoilers)  Probably the scariest scene in the entire movie is when she is trying to get the powder of life from one of Mombi's cases. She's about to get it, and then this happens:  Mombi:Dooorthy Gaaale!  Heads from various women begin to scream as the real headless Mombi rises from her bed.  Dorothy quickly grabs the powder of life and runs like there's no tomorrow.    This movie is so underrated and it's much better than the films these days, like those High School Musical crap (where are the goths, nerds, pregnant teens, and rapper-wannabees?) and Twilight (sorry, but I really hate these books/movies).    If you want a good fantasy film, go with this one. Enjoy!
B002HWRYJE|5.0|If you are like me ad have seen a LOT of movies trying to bring things back and the movies didn't live up to the original, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED! This movies goes back before the original Star Trek. This goes back to the beginnings of how Kirk, Spock and the rest of the crew came to be.<br /><br />If you ever wondered about those comments Kirk and Spock said over the years, how Kirk and Spock, as well as the rest of the main crew, met, started in star fleet, and even their childhood that made them who they are (their rebelliousness and struggles, those life-changing events, etc.) are done quickly, and brings you up to who they become in Starfleet.<br /><br />The actors, casting, etc. not only do the actors look like the original actors at different stages in their lives, but also took on the mannerisms, how they developed, and so on...<br /><br />I have avoided Blu-Ray up until now, but after seeing this version on DVD, I wished I had seen it in the theater, so will have to get it on Blu-Ray and finally break down and get a Blu Ray player with surround sound. If movies start to be shot like this, the having Blu Ray will be worth it.<br /><br />The rich sound, video and music are all worth putting it through a high-end home theater system!<br /><br />Trekkie or not, this is a great movie! If you are a Trekkie from the '60s, you won't be disappointed! Huge insights into the characters we all came to love, and how they became who they were!<br /><br />A must for ANY movie collection! If you like sci-Fi, you'll LOVE this!<br /><br />Well acted, well directed, well done!<br /><br />Hope we see more adventures from these characters! There are many more stories that the holes could be answered to by these characters!<br /><br />Great stuff! Worth getting a Blu Ray (or PS3) and surround sound system, if for nothing else, for this movie!

I love Warren's playing and singing. The band seems to have gelled into a more cohesive unit, and in new bass player Jorgen, I think warren's found his felix pappalardi.<br /><br />I'm surprised to see the negative reviews here. Really? You guys don't like this?<br /><br />All musicians change (if they're paying attention to their muse) and warren has taken a turn more towards hard rock, classic rock then blues.<br /><br />The riffs and songs are groovier and crunchier. That's why I like 'em. The sound of the album is more like a led zep or hendrix record, without being imitative, but with warren's great voice.<br /><br />The band has evolved and grown and changed. Warren's tone has changed, on this record. You want blues, listen to the Allmans. (who i love as well.)<br /><br />You want crunchy, funky, groonin' guitar tone and playing, buy this CD!<br /><br />I can't believe you guys don't love this!

B000W7JWUA|5.0|Settlers of Catan is a very dynamic board game which offers tons of fun, and is also a good way to teach basic economics.    The board game is made up of 19 hexes arranged roughly in a circle. There are 6 different types of hexes. 5 of them produce resources while the 6th (desert hex) does not.     Each hex has a number token placed on it. Using 2 dice, when the number of a hex is rolled, settlements located on the vertices of that hex will produce resources.     Using the 5 types of resources, players aim to build roads to expand and build more settlements, which in turn can be used to acquire more resources, and later upgrade their settlements to cities. Cities will produce 2 resources for the hex they are situated on.     Each settlement is worth 1 point, and each city is worth 2. The goal is to emerge victorious with 10 Victory Points.    There is another way to acquire resources, and that is through trading. Players can: trade with each other, trade via a port, trade through maritime trade.    Trading with other players benefits those involved but sometimes, they may not have what you need, or simply don't want to trade to you. In this situation, using a port, where a settlement of city is located enables players to trade 2 or 3 of the same resource for the resource desired. Trading through maritime trade is the most costly, because the ratio is 4:1.    In addition to building, players can spend resources to purchase Development Cards. The cards have different effects, which range from earning an additional Victory Point, building 2 roads at no cost, taking all of a specific resource players hold (Monopoly), to using the Knight Card to move the Robber to a different hex and steal a resource from a player whose settlement or city is built upon.    There are two other ways to acquire points. The first is via The Longest Road. The player with The Longest Road earns 2 extra Victory Points. The second is via The Largest Army. This involves purchasing Development Cards, and using the Knight Card more than any other player (minimum of 3 Knights must be played).    While there is no limit to the number of resources players can hold, there is a safe maximum amount to hold on to. The magic number is 7. When a 7 is rolled, (the most frequently rolled number) all players who hold 8 or more cards must discard half, rounded down. The turn player then moves the robber to a hex and take a resource card from a player whose settlement is built on. The robber also prevents that hex from producing any resources. This game mechanic enables lagging players a chance to stifle the lead of others and catch up.    The arrangement of the hexes, number tokens and ports can be changed each time (shuffle face down for randomness) to offer a different board layout so the game is never quite the same. The learning curve isn't that steep, but it takes a keen trader and strategist to come out on top.     In my experience, this game is most enjoyable with 4 players (there is an extension set to allow 2 more players to play). Play time is generally about 1-1.5 hours. It is a great way to interact with friends and family members, alongside snacks, drinks and with a sports event or movie playing in the background.     If you're leaning on the fence, on whether to purchase, check out the tons of images online for Settlers of Catan.    Thanks for reading. I hope you found this review helpful.
0385504225|2.0|I really enjoyed Angels and Demons and the Da Vinci Code but the Lost Symbol is a disaster.  If this had been his first effort, it would never have been published.  I can handle the writing style but feel that this story lacks substance and interest.  Without giving anything away, there are a couple of climactic moments that totally fizzled.    The only reason I did not give this one star is that I enjoy the way he weaves history into his modern tales...just think this tale was forced and lacks interest.

I've owned this Album in just about every format imaginable and I can easily say that it has NEVER sounded this good! I heard things, subtle nuances in instrumentation and vocals that I have never heard before ( I.E. \\"I Am The Walrus\\" ). I can't praise the sound quality enough. As if that was not enough, I also really liked the packaging; sure it will require a little care BUT I liked the liner notes, photos, and \\"throw back\\" look of the digi pak. Nice job.

B001AVCFK6|3.0|If you are quite young and experiencing Star Trek for the first time, you will probably enjoy this movie. But you are not experiencing the real Star Trek in any way.<br /><br />I am 55 years old, and have been a big fan of the Star Trek franchise since Capt. Kirk and crew first debuted on the small screen on NBC in the late 1960's. I have thrilled at all of the TV spin-offs of Star Trek. I was whisked away with glorious adventure with all of the Star Trek movies.  Gene Roddenberry was and still is a hero to us true Trekkie's.  But I am certain that our old long passed friend, Gene, is turning in his grave at this latest installment of the Star Trek franchise. I know that Gene would not approve of what they have done to his dream. If he were alive today, this movie would have never been made.<br /><br />The original TV shows and movies were a bright and wonderful adventure. They gave us a positive glimpse into the future, even if it was just fantasy. The shows had great special effects, but they weren't the whole show. They had real story lines to follow.  It was an escape into a better time.  The cast members from ST:TOS through ST: Enterprise, became our hero's. We knew personal details about each character like they were old friends. We got to be involved with their personal lives and careers. They were real human beings that acted their roles well.  Even though the look and technology in the shows advanced with time, the original formula that was a Gene Roddenberry signature was always easily recognized, and truly appreciated. When Gene passed away, Rick Berman and his crew followed very closely to Gene's formula, and kept the feel of Star Trek alive and well.  If this is what you are expecting with this new Star Trek movie, you will be greatly disappointed.<br /><br />Remember the last Ford Thunderbird that was made? It really wasn't a Thunderbird. It was a completely different car with the name \\"Thunderbird\\" put on it to attract buyers. This new Star Trek movieis not really a Star Trek Movie. They just kept the original crew names and the Star Trek label to attract older Trekkie's.<br /><br />This latest Star Trek movie is very different in every way. I can only think that the writers and producers did this to attract a whole new younger, texting, video game playing generation.  JJ Abrams has turned Star Trek into a dark version of itself. It looks fake like a video game turned into a movie.  The old Roddenberry formula has been thrown out the window, and replaced with a dark \\"What if\\" version.  In other words, what if Star Trek had not began and played out the way it was originally written and portrayed over the last 45 years? Kirk, McCoy, Chekov, Sulu, Scottie, and Uhura were never on the Enterprise under Capt. Pike. But they are in this movie. The entire design and layout of the Enterprise from bow to stern is completely changed. The bridge has technology that resembles the 24th century episodes, except the main viewer is now a glass window instead of the original electronic screen. Engineering looks like an old factory with water pipes running everywhere. Even the transporter beam now looks like cutesy swirling sparkling stars, instead of the original color beams that faded the person away. In this version, it seems that Uhura and Spock have the hots for each other. What's up with that? And Vulcan has been destroyed.  This movie depended completely on CGI special effects and very little story line for the characters.  For all of us true Star Trek fans, Star Trek ended with the movie \\"Nemesis\\", and the TV series, \\"Enterprise\\".<br /><br />On the technical side, the BluRay version is no better than the standard DVD. Many scenes are in a haze, some look grainy like an old movie. I have standard DVDs that look better. Also, way too much editing. Scenes are constantly changing, making it hard to follow the actors and action.<br /><br />The Amazon.com details for the BluRay version claims it is in Dolby Digital 5.1 Extendedsurround. But it is actually in True HD surround.  This means if your audio system is \\"Pre TrueHD\\", you will not hear it in Dolby Digital 5.1.  Instead you will hear it in Dolby Pro-Logic only. The real joke is, you can switch to the French or Spanish audio tracks and hear the audio in full Dolby Digital 5.1. But the English track is in Pro-Logic for most \\"Pre TrueHD\\" system owners.  If your home theater system is \\"Pre TrueHD\\"  you will have to return the BluRay version and get the standard DVD instead. It is the only way you will get to hear the audio in Dolby Digital 5.1, and I know the picture quality will be as good. Standard DVDs do not carry True HD audio, so it will be in Dolby Digital 5.1 EX or DTS-ES6.1, or both.<br /><br />Overall, the movie was filled with excitement, had a few good moments, and it was nice to see the older Mr. Spock from the future.  He was the only sign that reminded me I was actually watching a Star Trek movie.  If future Star Trek movies look anything like this one, I probably will just wait for it to get on HBO to check it out.

B002HWRYJE|3.0|If you are quite young and experiencing Star Trek for the first time, you will probably enjoy this movie. But you are not experiencing the real Star Trek in any way.<br /><br />I am 55 years old, and have been a big fan of the Star Trek franchise since Capt. Kirk and crew first debuted on the small screen on NBC in the late 1960's. I have thrilled at all of the TV spin-offs of Star Trek. I was whisked away with glorious adventure with all of the Star Trek movies. Gene Roddenberry was and still is a hero to us true Trekkie's. But I am certain that our old long passed friend, Gene, is turning in his grave at this latest installment of the Star Trek franchise. I know that Gene would not approve of what they have done to his dream. If he were alive today, this movie would have never been made.<br /><br />The original TV shows and movies were a bright and wonderful adventure. They gave us a positive glimpse into the future, even if it was just fantasy. The shows had great special effects, but they weren't the whole show. They had real story lines to follow. It was an escape into a better time. The cast members from ST:TOS through ST: Enterprise, became our hero's. We knew personal details about each character like they were old friends. We got to be involved with their personal lives and careers. They were real human beings that acted their roles well. Even though the look and technology in the shows advanced with time, the original formula that was a Gene Roddenberry signature was always easily recognized, and truly appreciated. When Gene passed away, Rick Berman and his crew followed very closely to Gene's formula, and kept the feel of Star Trek alive and well. If this is what you are expecting with this new Star Trek movie, you will be greatly disappointed.<br /><br />Remember the last Ford Thunderbird that was made? It really wasn't a Thunderbird. It was a completely different car with the name \\"Thunderbird\\" put on it to attract buyers. This new Star Trek movie is not really a Star Trek Movie. They just kept the original crew names and the Star Trek label to attract older Trekkie's.<br /><br />This latest Star Trek movie is very different in every way. I can only think that the writers and producers did this to attract a whole new younger, texting, video game playing generation. JJ Abrams has turned Star Trek into a dark version of itself. It looks fake like a video game turned into a movie. The old Roddenberry formula has been thrown out the window, and replaced with a dark \\"What if\\" version. In other words, what if Star Trek had not began and played out the way it was originally written and portrayed over the last 45 years? Kirk, McCoy, Chekov, Sulu, Scottie, and Uhura were never on the Enterprise under Capt. Pike. But they are in this movie. The entire design and layout of the Enterprise from bow to stern is completely changed. The bridge has technology that resembles the 24th century episodes, except the main viewer is now a glass window instead of the original electronic screen. Engineering looks like an old factory with water pipes running everywhere. Even the transporter beam now looks like cutesy swirling sparkling stars, instead of the original color beams that faded the person away. In this version, it seems that Uhura and Spock have the hots for each other. What's up with that? And Vulcan has been destroyed.

B0001JXQDI|4.0|If only the track \\"My Rival\\" didn't have the percussion (timbales I think) completely MISSING from the surround mix. Listen for yourselves: in the first minute of the cut, there should be a triplet break by the timbale player, (actually a double stroke rough, then a triplet) and on EVERY OTHER VERSION its there...except this one. What the hell happened?? I'm surprised that no one noticed or commented on this, but to me its a BIG deal. Actually, its a DEAL -BREAKER in many ways. I'm being a bit generous in giving it four stars, to me, it may deserve less. But, the sound is otherwise superb--it almost seems to lift a veil off the music that I thought I knew, giving it a new pace and feel that's more sensuous and sublime. Really wonderful.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Castle is the funniest show around, which is interesting because it's also a crime drama. It's also the best show depicting a quirky but loving family. Most shows about which you could make that last comment are cast with some very strange actors all doing their own schtick, but this show is well-integrated: a truly stellar ensemble cast. Admittedly, I'd be happy listening to Nathan Fillion read the phone book, but he doesn't hog the jokes. His reactions to the other characters, which are often hilarious, feel real; he's not scene stealing, he's enhancing. Love this show! I wish there had been more bloopers, but overall the disk set of the first season is well produced with nice packaging and it arrived from Amazon in good shape. Small plug for Amazon shipping department: I've never received anything damaged from them, a fact that sends me back to Amazon all other things being equal.
B00006SFLV|4.0|I love Claire Danes as Angela going through all that connect with life angst.  The whole process of dealing with people and circumstance just struck a cord with me.    Amzaingly, I have transformed into Angela's parents, with all the same problems.  Great series, wish their could have been a season two.
B002H3F7F6|3.0|I am and always have been a Sting fan.  On this collection, I love half of this music and the other half, I could do without.  I love the new arrangements of old favorites like Gabriel's Message and The Hounds of Winter.  The Snow It Melts the Soonest is a lovely arrangement of a song I'm familiar with from a Celtic CD of Christmas songs.  Christmas At Sea, wonderful.  Sometimes songs grow on me after I've heard them a few times.  I hope that is the case here, but I really am not interested in listening for a second time some of these songs, such as Cherry Tree Carol.  I would say if you are a Sting fan, you should have this CD.  What I intend to do is download the songs I want to listen to and that will be that.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|I guess I should admit up front that I was and am an avid fan of Star Trek, TOS. In spite (or because) of this, however, both my 16 year-old daughter and I find this film thoroughly enjoyable.    To a degree, I understand some of the complaints about the character development not being up to expectations. I think there are two good reasons for this. First, the characters are young, and - particularly Spock - are still in their formative stages. Yes, in some instances, Kirk is \\"over the top,\\" and Spock has yet to master the conflict inherent in his ancestry. Some forget that Vulcans have not eliminated emotions: they merely attempt to control them with an iron-willed - albeit intellectual - intensity. Similarly, have some of us forgotten the wildness of our youth? Clearly, nobody is born knowing how to do this. In both cases, however, there are moments in the film that reveal the men Spock and Kirk will become.    Second, there will be sequels. I remember one of the main criticisms of the first Harry Potter movie was the apparent lack of character development, but the writers remembered, if viewers did not, that there were six (now seven) films to go. You can't trot everything out in the first edition. Let's just hope the Star Trek writers also remember that the interplay between the three main characters is the heart and soul of the original series, and that this process will be one of evolution rather than metamorphosis. In short, if some viewers are just looking for hyper-extended plotlines overwhelmed with special effects, there are certainly enough examples of those circling about. Star Trek, TOS, on the other hand, is character driven, and early indications suggest that the present creators are aware of that.    The re-creation of Star Trek (re-boot doesn't quite cover it) was a formidable undertaking attendant with all sorts of baggage, passions, responsibilities, and expectations. It is also a film with two audiences to please - one familiar, one not; one young, one....well, you get the idea. With that in mind, those who have delivered the latest version of this (apparently) indefatigable saga should be commended for a job well done. For sure, it's a lot to squeeze into just two hours, but the final product is exciting, refreshingly familiar, and - most important - fun. It is well worth two hours of anyone's time. Some of us, in fact, would be grateful to age as well.
B0000CD5I6|5.0|I have owned this CD several years now.  It is my favorite.  I love love love this.  Every selection is perfect.  I have given it as gifts to many of my friends that are Tull fans or not. Either way, they also love it.  Ian Anderson's voice always gets to me anyway....  I listen to this mostly when I'm driving (my travel companion) and when I'm cleaning my house because the energy of the music gets me going!  Love to sing along!  Love the humor in Last Man at The Party, the message in A Christmas Song, and a sort of haunting quality in Jack Frost and the Hooded Crow.  My favorite is probably First Snow on Brooklyn - just a lovely song that may touch many hearts that have been broken around Christmas.  I love it.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|For some reason I was highly sceptical of the remastered stereo box set, and hence I did not purchase it right away when it came out in September. But then by chance I had the opportunity to check out one of these albums in the set (\\"With the Beatles\\", actually) and I was stunned at what I saw and heard. I finally ordered the set here on Amazon at a very good price, and the box arrived at my house the other day. Boy, am I glad I've ordered this!<br /><br />\\"The Beatles\\" (14 albums, a total of 16 CDs; plus 1 DVD) is about as far away as you can get from the initial original 1987 CD release of the Beatles albums. First and foremost, the sound is fantastic, MILES better than the original CDs. Much is made about the pros and cons of the stereo mix for the early albums, and ultimately this is a subjective call (I like it). Equally important is the packaging of the albums, which is done with care for details. The DVD (50 min.) is a handy collection of the 13 mini-documentaries that otherwise is available on each of the 13 studio albums (not for the \\"Past Masters\\" album). It's nice to have, but I doubt I will watch it often again. Instead you can bet that I will listen to the various Beatles albums time and again. For whatever reason I had never purchased the White Album on CD, and listening to it now is just stunning.<br /><br />If you were on the fence about buying this, as was I, do not hesitate any longer. It will be worth every penny, I can assure you. Simply a MUST HAVE for any and all Beatles fans around the world.

B0013D89YM|5.0|A pop rock opus that's seemingly immune to time. Jeff Lynnne isn't in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (as of this writing) but Ricky Nelson is. Excuse me? Nothing personal Rick--you made a mark too. I'm sorry but hasn't Lynne created a unique and entirely original sound? Did he not have a platter of hits? Isn't he an obviously in-demand producer (Traveling Wilburys, George Harrison, Tom Petty, The Beatles)?
B001NESPHC|5.0|Melody Gardot is a spectacular artist. Her voice is thin but full of emotion, the music is rich, and the lyrics are poetic.  The CD feels dark, emotional, unapologetic. `My One and Only Thrill' is even better than the original!
B001LRJH0K|5.0|Appaloosa is a serious western with excellent acting and enough gunfighting and tension to keep you interested. Rancher Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons) murders a marshal and deputies who came to arrest killers among his men. The town hires contract marshal Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) and his loyal shotgun-toting partner Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) to make things right. Widow Renne Zellweger is the recently arrived widow who takes to Harris who reluctantly accepts her flirting and infidelity. I'm not really a fan of Zellweger who tends to play somewhat odd character roles, but she does a worthy job here opposite Harris as a lonely, vulnerable woman desperate for a permanent relationship in the vicious, hard, cruel west. Appaloosa does not have as much gun action as 3:10 to Yuma, but it does have enough character study without the silliness that exists in many westerns, and that is one of it's strengths.<br /><br />The blu-ray transfer was fine and I appreciated the Special Features section as actor/director Harris and others in the cast discuss making the film and their efforts at recreating the 1880's costumes and sets. Also interesting are the tracks \\"Scare Easy\\" by Tom Petty and Mudcrutch, and \\"You'll Never Leave My Heart\\" co-written and sung by Harris, that play as the end credits roll.
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|I've been wanting a Whitney Houston CD for some time now, and I looked through all of the ones on Amazon, and this one had a lot of songs that I like.  I love it!  Great CD!  I have had a little trouble playing it sometimes on my car CD player, but I'm pretty sure it's my car CD player.
B001CGJ3QS|5.0|I totally agree with the other reviews regarding this steller set of cds. Kempff captures the passion, beauty, and grace that are inherent to Beethoven's piano sonatas. I am really not sure anything else needs to be said - this is the set to own!
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I grew up watching the Star Trek shows as a kid and Watch all the Star Trek movies. My Previous favorite was The Vogage Home. I still love that movie but this is the best Star Trek movie ever. I never was a Trekie, I just enjoyed the shows and the movies.  This movie answered alot of the questions about each of the charecters and how they became who they were with humor and witt, but also stayed interesting throughout. very entertaining.
0316069906|5.0|This is an excellent book. I just read the review in the New York Times and was disappointed by the last paragraph which stated that readers wondered how Foer could expend so much energy and caring on the fate of pigs and chickens when he should be more concerned   about the death of 1 million children caused by malaria, and atrocities in the Congo caused by conflicts.  This argument implies that:  1. we should not be humane towards animals while malaria exists,  2. as soon as malaria is cured, then we can take care of animals. Yeh, right, like that ever happened after we eradicated any disease....  3. And just when have we ever ended a war somewhere and then moved on to help the animals who suffered there?  It's a cheap argument... and unfortunately, one which is commonly used. Isaac Bashevis Singer said that for animals, every day was an Auschwitz.  The pain of animals is as real as the pain of people. So why does it drive some people mad when we compare the two?   Why don't they use that anger to fight against all suffering...  We have only one heart. It's the same heart which we use to help people, as well as animals. When will people stop repeating that we cannot do one until we have settled the other? And isn't that a catch 22? People hurt animals yet we should not help animals until we have helped every person.....
B001NFNFNU|1.0|This is a 2 and a half hour movie...yet there is no reason in the world it needed to be this long.  It's a pretty simple story.  Cut an hour out of it and give it some \\"oomph\\" and it would have been fascinating.    By the end I really didn't care to see the finish...it didn't seem to matter to me at all what the final outcome was.    Here's the story:    One day in 1920's Los Angeles a single mother comes home from work one day and her son is gone.  She frantically calls the police and they aren't very helpful.  Luckily, a local minister with a radio show broadcasts her story, creates a stink about it.  The police find her son and re-unite them.  But it's not her son.  But the police assure her she's just confused from the trauma etc.  She goes to dentists, neighbours, teachers, etc. and they all agree with her; it's not her son.  So she hounds the LAPD some more.  They throw her in a mental ward to shut her up.  Meanwhile, a serial killer (who killed 20+ children) is discovered, and her son is among the dead (perhaps).  The minister gets a lawyer and storms the mental hospital, freeing the mother.  They all expose what the LAPD did (the switcheroo with the kid to shut up the public about him gone missing when they should have been finding that serial killer, and locking her and other women up in a mental ward to shut them up).  The LAPD captains lose their jobs, the serial killer is hanged.  THE END.    That's it.  That's basically all that happens in the film.  It really shouldn't be that long.    It just drags and drags and drags.  There's a \\"serial killer in court\\" scene, a \\"serial killer talks to the mother scene\\", and a \\"serial killer gets hanged scene\\" tacked onto the end...all for no reason at all.  They could have just shown a 5 second clip of him being hanged and we would lose nothing from it.  Same thing with the police captain trial.  He loses his job and the courtroom all claps and cheers wildly.  All of this can be cut.  It's just all padded nonsense.Also, they threw in some historical inaccuracies just for kicks.  The serial killer actually killed the boys along with his mother; there were 4 boys killed, not 20+, no boys escaped from the ranch, etc.    I suggest just reading the wikipedia page and giving the movie a pass:    [...]
B001QOGYB8|4.0|Wes Anderson's screenplay for the Roald Dahl classic Fantastic Mr. Box brings a refreshing update to the original with modern day elements such as conglomerates, yoga, bombs and supermarkets. The new storyline veers away from the original in a number of aspects but is entertaining nonetheless. It's really more for adults than the usual children classic.<br /><br />The casting of George Clooney and Meryl Streep as the voices of Mr. and Mrs. Fox is the wisest and almost natural choice. Clooney's crafty voice and Streep's subtleness brings the animated puppets to life. Bill Murray voices the wise attorney Badger. The range of expressions on the characters and the comedic effects they bring shine throughout the movie. Interspersed within are songs from The Beach Boys and Jarvis Cocker.  A-
B002K0WBYG|5.0|Sandra Bullock is a great actress and she really knows what she is doing. I have respect for her movies and her business savvy. I loved the location of the filming. The Proposal is very esay to watch and relate to, for both men & women. Lots of funny parts and could be viewed as somewhat educational if viewed between the lines.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie quite well. But I am an avid Sandra Bullock fan, so I guess I'm a bit biased.
B000006MS3|5.0|I remember reading somewhere that playing this Kate Bush's THE DREAMING on Halloween might serve to invite all manor of demons, goblins and things that go bump in the night into one's life.  Well, it certainly is one of the eeriest records I've ever heard, but I doubt anyone's in danger of accidentally summoning \\"Captain Howdy\\" no matter when you play it.<br /><br />I would caution you to be careful for WHOM you play it.  THE DREAMING was my own intro to Kate Bush's work back in the early '80s and it threw me for an absolute loop.  I had never heard anything quite like it--quite as brilliant that is.  I was never one to object to letting a little \\"weirdness in.\\"  But I surmised even then what I know now: this one's gonna scare the proverbial wits out of a lot of neophytes.  As off-the-wall as \\"Wuthering Heights\\" or \\"Running Up That Hill\\" were in their ways, they'll always serve as better texts for Kate 101.  Save this brilliant record for your grad level work, I'd say.<br /><br />Kate's misterioso side was given full reign on THE DREAMING.  Back in the day, I only had a little cassette player in my German dorm room and the European tape I had provided no lyric sheet.  For some reason, I thought ALL the songs had something to do with death and the world beyond.  I interpreted the caper-gone-wrong song, \\"There Goes A Tenner,\\" as being told from the point of view of the ghost of one of the would-be perps (who failed to treat the \\"gelignite tenderly\\" and blown themselves to kingdom come).<br /><br />That may have been an over-interpretation.  When I look at the actual lyrics these days, I don't see what prompted me to draw that particular conclusion.  On the other hand, \\"All the Love,\\" \\"Houdini,\\" and, especially, \\"Get Out of My House\\" really are quite spooky, in their various ways.  And the title tune is, while having more to do with Aboriginal lore, is just as eerie when you get right down to it.  Guaranteed you've never heard anything quite like it.<br /><br />Listening to THE DREAMING might not lead to actual demonic possession, but it WILL turn your head around.
B00001OH7X|5.0|whatever bowie album you happen to be listening to is just the best bowie album for all time - that law of bowie-physics-and-magic just happens to be true for this album too<br /><br />jon savage, in Melody Maker, 1979, when these tracks were released, described it thus: \\"We turn the world into three-minute pop songs!\\"<br /><br />weel, maybe - you can listen to, feel, get off on, drape yourself under, imbibe feverishly and suffocate maddingly by the stuff of this album as if it's, at the very least, the finest of bowie's berlin days - how? - just listen to how each piece kicks off - each bit of texture and each move of tone is like nothing you've ever really heard before at the start of a song - while it doesn't draw attention to itself; a bit of reflection proves that your experience right now is extra special.<br /><br />as for specific emotions, this album could easily twist you into and out of many far ways - a sense of loss here, a pulse of hope there, a twitch of lost hope and a scratch of hopeful loss here and there; urgency; angst; despair; glory.<br /><br />a tidbit: the musicians on this album often played the instruments they didn't usually play - like the lead played the bass, or the bass played the drums, or something like that. so you never get what you might expect, and this album was at least as creatively constructed as the earlier two in the \\"berlin trilogy\\". to push the point, the music scholar Matthew-Walker wrote of this album, in \\"David Bowie: Theatre of Music\\" (1985):<br /><br /> \\"It is one thing to pick chords at random as though one were playing a musical game of chance. But it is quite another to have used this random method of composition (used by certain European classical composers for the previous thirty years) and to create something meaningful and lasting from it. That Bowie does this on this album is another of his extraordinary creative achievements\\" (p. 121).<br /><br />lodger has many of my own bowie faves on it: the shattering German-romantic and expressionistic \\"look back in anger\\", the introspective and social-philosophical \\"fantastic voyage\\" (with its cut-and-dry reference to \\"somebody's depression\\"), the street-cantering and sneering, the sickly and ecstatic \\"d.j.\\" ...<br /><br />& here's some listening tips, from the in-the-know critics:<br /> * \\"Fantastic Voyage\\" and \\"Boys Keep Swinging\\" have an almost identical chordal basis<br /> * \\"Repetition\\" goes off \\"oscillating between adjacent keys a tone apart (the bass hypnotically plucking away at low As and Bs)\\"<br /> * \\"Red Money\\" is a recoup of Bowie's composition for Iggy, \\"Sister Midnight\\"<br /> * does \\"Boys Keep Swinging\\" really \\"nick the bass riff from the Beach Boys' 'You're so good to me'\\"? - as Jon Savage, in Melody Maker, 1979, asserted?<br /> * is \\"lodger\\" really the kid of the first side of \\"Low\\" mixed with \\"Station to Station\\"?<br /><br />probably the nearest of bowie's later works that this album sound like, by my own opinion, are on his \\"hours ...\\" album - especially \\"dreamers,\\" \\"new angels of promise\\" and \\"pretty things are going to hell\\" - you can hear the berlin in those tracks too, eh?<br /><br />unpassable.n anger\\", the introspective and social-philosophical \\"fantastic voyage\\" (with its cut-and-dry reference to \\"somebody's depression\\"), the street-cantering and sneering, the sickly and ecstatic \\"d.j.\\" ...    & here's some listening tips, from the in-the-know critics:    * \\"Fantastic Voyage\\" and \\"Boys Keep Swinging\\" have an almost identical chordal basis   * \\"Repetition\\" goes off \\"oscillating between adjacent keys a tone apart (the bass hypnotically plucking away at low As and Bs)\\"   * \\"Red Money\\" is a recoup of Bowie's composition for Iggy, \\"Sister Midnight\\"    * does \\"Boys Keep Swinging\\" really \\"nick the bass riff from the Beach Boys' 'You're so good to me'\\"? - as Jon Savage, in Melody Maker, 1979, asserted?   * is \\"lodger\\" really the kid of the first side of \\"Low\\" mixed with \\"Station to Station\\"?    probably the nearest of bowie's later works that this album sound like, by my own opinion, are on his \\"hours ...\\" album - especially \\"dreamers,\\" \\"new angels of promise\\" and \\"pretty things are going to hell\\" - you can hear the berlin in those tracks too, eh?    unpassable.

B000MGUZM0|5.0|As my title says, this is really on of the most amazing and beautiful albums I've ever heard. It's truly deep and very well written. I love Arcade Fire because their songs are really from the heart: I can really feel the emotion when they sing and play; it's amazing! The emotion I feel when listening to songs like 'No Cars Go', and 'My Body is a Cage' is really overwhelming; my whole body gets goosebumps! This album is truly amazing, and I recommend it to all. Don't look at this album and not buy it. Every song is incredible! Buy this and you'll be listening to it all the time. It's worth much more than what it sells for. Bravo Arcade Fire, *CLAP* *CLAP*

I own a Kindle and have many of her books on Kindle.  A Woman of Substance was not available on Kindle, so I ordered the book and just finished it.  I have read all but one of the rest of the saga.  I'm sure I have read it, but don't have it any longer and would like to get it again.  It was Hold The Dream.  A Women of Substance was one of my favorite books.  Ruby Adams
B000M4RG42|5.0|Just had a look at a description of the book on which this film was based. Made understandable the structure of the film which somewhat puzzled and a little disturbed me as I saw it. Felt the interweaving of combat with later events weakened the impact of each. However, turns out the book was an extensive study of the lives of 6 men and the combat which united them at the pole on which they placed and raised the American flag on a hill in Iwo Jima. Not having a mini-series of  10 or more hours at their disposal and yet having to, (by contractual arrangement), or wanting to, they had to cover both facets of the book in one two hour movie. They did a fine job. The combat scenes stand up very well, the civilian scenes less so since the personalities formed in the early years prior to service might have explained better the situational accommodations made to post-combat conditions. At any rate, this is a film worth seeing mostly for the thesis that men (and, now, women )in  combat are mostly ordinary people who have to adjust to extraordinary circumstances and react often in extraordinary ways. While the brutality of war is suggested,  no film can convey the extent to which fear, hatred, the close bonds of the primary group in the military, the shattering of bodies and souls, and sheer necessity create a boiling cauldron out of which anything can emerge.  Certainly, a  notable film despite minor flaws.
B002BSHXJA|2.0|I'm not convinced that it's such a big improvement. In fact, I'm sure it's not. Some of my old stereo cd versions seem crisp compared to the mono versions which seem a bit dull. And, if I wanted to hear the music in mono I could just flip a switch.    I don't understand why it had to be mono. If you have the original tracks you can do remix in stereo just as easy. From what I understand about the Stereo set is that the kept the vocal on one side and instruments on the other and that's it's not worth the money (being remastered and not remixed). Why they couldn't make a clean, clear, crisp, decent stereo version is beyond me.    One thing I have read about the Mono set is that it's supposed to sound like it did when it originally played on AM radio or// Monaural record players. My thought is this.. Why do you want their music to sound like it's being transmitted from a crappy AM broadcast signal to a crappy AM receiver (or a really bad AM transistor radio), or if you had a mono record player with low-fi electronic and a needle arm being held down on a 45rpm vinyl grooved record by coins or washers with the music being pushed through a 2\\" to 4\\" paper speaker with a power rating of about 3 watts?     Some have comment about the cover art being so great. Well it's fine but you are wrapping questionable quality in a pretty box.
B002AGIEYG|5.0|Finally, Rattle has produced standard repertoire renditions that can be considered a milestone. This release is the finest, most consistent set of Brahms symphonies since the Klemperer boxed set. He may be a little soft-grained at times, particularly in the first sypmhony where Klemperer is more heroic and menacing, but he has the full measure of the second and fourth which are equal with the best. His third, while excellent, does not have the cohesive drive that Toscanini brought to his performance with the Philhamonia Orchestra during his 1952 tour of England. Karajan, in all his series,  is far too self-indulgently obsessive with rich sonorities, and Abbado's performances of the symphonies are four-square, unimaginatively phrased and plodding. A must-have set for all Brahms lovers.
B002KREVE2|5.0|At last, living history on dvd where Cohen calms the hungry ,restless and angry crowd with his serene music and peaceful interpretation of life centered around his love and care for his fellow man -especially those who anguish.  One of a kind footage that has never been equalled by anybody ,in my opinion.  Lovingly filmed and beautifully produced.  Not to be missed by any Cohenites and anybody seeking a peaceful time to peruse this wonderfully put together product.

B001MS7IBS|5.0|Fringe: The Complete First Season is outstanding.  With no commercial interruptions it makes watching more enjoyable as well as clearly seeing how each episode has a tie-in to the next episode which was not as obvious when watching the series on commercial television.  Can't wait for season two release.
9113020730|5.0|I was one of those people who couldn't wait till the Spring when the book is released in the states. I'm glad I didn't. Larsson's dense and thrilling trilogy comes to a more than satisfying conclusion, wrapping up the story of Lisbeth Salander and Blomkvist. To give much away would be a disservice to everyone who has followed it this far. Suffice to say, that at about the halfway mark the book became harder and harder to put down. And I left the book a little bittersweetly knowing we'd never get to read anything from this incredibly talented writer again.
B002JODUI4|5.0|Wow! And I thought Random Album Title was good! His sophomore album is even better... Deadmau5 has created another album that you can listen to at home like it was a rock or pop album but that still gives you the same rush as if you were at a club dancing. Interesting music that`s fun to listen to and very danceable. Beats you just can`t get out of your head. This is the best thing to ever happen to electro/house.

If you search the web you will find out what non-genuine Photofast adapters look like and what it will do to your PSP.  MEDIA MART does not have the original product, BLUE PLANET won't ship to apartments (cancelled my order because it was an unshippable address), but eTECH has genuine PHOTOFAST product, as does ABX.  I just received both and they both worked like a champ.  Note that my PSP did not recognize the item as 16 GB, but the computer did.  I copied movies and music and photos and all 16 GB were immediately accessible, no worries.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|Having grown up with TOS, I was skeptical at first before watching this. Prequels are usually what franchises do when they have nowhere else to go. This movie blew me away (yet I hate the mind**** of past/future issues in any scifi movie). Nonetheless, I enjoyed the movie so much that I immediately watched it again after the credits rolled. I think this is the best Trek movie since Wrath of Khan. There were some headscratching moments like the Spok/Uhura relationship and Scotty learning his own formula from a future Spok, but at some point I just went with it and enjoyed it.

0316069906|3.0|First, there was Michael Pollan, whose book \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma,\\" a book I deeply admire, exposed the horrors (and yes, they are horrors) of what is now called \\"factory farming\\" and the devastating effects of agribusiness on the American diet. And there was Barbara Kingsolver, whose chatty family experiment in local eating (\\"Animal, Vegetable, Miracle\\") popularized the notion of growing your own or at least patronizing the local farmer's market. Now there is Jonathan Safran Foer, who deploys his considerable literary gifts against factory farming of every kind (pork, poultry, and fish, primarily, Pollan having already covered beef). Foer is a recent convert to vegetarianism and to philosophical ideas about animal rights.  He proselytizes with a convert's zeal, beginning with a clever Swiftian analysis of why it might be as acceptable to eat dogs as it is to eat chicken. His depictions of giant crowded poultry houses, of sprawling hog farms and their lagoons of manure, of the tons of discarded \\"bycatch\\" of fishing trawlers are riveting and utterly appalling.<br /><br />This is also a deeply confused book. On the one hand, Foer is drawn to the absolutist position: it is never acceptable to eat animals. Farming, he feels, even humane family farming, must inevitably inflict pain,  if only at slaughter, so one must always abstain. This position, however, is never explored deeply, only stated, again and again. Foer never clearly says whether he is a vegetarian or a vegan, although logic would require the latter.  He briefly discusses egg layers (and their inevitable byproduct, male layer chickens) He does not discuss dairy farming (and its inevitable byproduct, male calves). What to do with those male chickens and calves? Does he eschew leather, a byproduct of cattle slaughter? He does not say. Furthermore, he includes sympathetic portraits of a number of small scale farmers whose treatment of animals seems admirable, although they always fail Foer's standard of \\"no pain should be inflicted, not ever.\\"  Occasionally, he retreats even from his measured admiration, as when he takes a gratuitous slap at Joel Salatin, the poultry farmer Pollan admires in \\"Omnivore.\\" He cannot bring himself to say, as Pollan does, that eating as little meat as possible and seeking out humanely raised meat might be a good idea for some. Instead, he draws (offensive, I thought) parallels between the civil rights movement and the animal rights movement.<br /><br />The book held my attention until about the halfway point, when it ran out of gas and began to recycle its arguments. This is a book heavily dependent on book learning (copious notes), as opposed to the work of someone who had spent considerable time on a farm or around animals (undercover PETA expeditions excluded). It is, one could say, an urban book by an urban author for an urban audience that surely needs a good shake as it reaches for the package of cheap Tyson chicken thighs at the Fairway. (The ready availability of  chicken parts-- packages that contain only breasts or thighs or wings--is a direct result of factory farming.) I'm all for any author who can get people to think about--and hopefully rebel against--the unhealthful and cruel practices of assembly line meat production. But if one can never inflict pain on an animal, what am I to do when hornworms devour my (organic) tomato crop or potato beetles defoliate the potatoes?  Foer is eloquent when he discusses the nervous systems of fish in relation to their awareness of pain. He doesn't say anything about insects.<br />M.

0061864153|4.0|Just received my cd/dvd of the Circle and When We Were Beautiful Book. Love them all.  A must have if you are a true fan.  Book has lots of great pics -- not too much reading which would have been an extra bonus - overall worth every cent spent.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I'll keep it short because a lot of other people have already worded reviews much better than mine. I loved this movie. (How's that for short?)<br /><br />I've been a Trek fan for almost all of my 29 years, starting when I was a little kid watching TOS in syndication and every other series as they came out on TV over the years. I own all of the original series episodes, all 10 previous movies (DVD and Blu-Ray) and love watching them regularly (and will continue to enjoy them even if that timeline is a divergence!). I love that there will be new adventures with all of my favorite characters in the years to come, and hopefully a new horde of fans who will discover TOS/TNG/DS9/Voy/Ent through JJ Abrams efforts. I also love that this film respects and allows the other films and series to continue to exist for the continuity nerds out there to argue about for decades to come.<br /><br />To the people taking issue with someone messing around with the timeline...relax. Trek has always been loosey goosey with the timeline/continuity when the needs of the many outweighed the needs of the few (ahem). You can still enjoy the previously released Star Trek continuity...and if you really want to, you can hate and ignore any new material coming from JJ and company. I'm going to look forward to new adventures, hopefully for years to come. Gene Roddenberry himself hoped that someday someone would take his stories and do them one better...and I think this film has done it in spades.
0061537969|5.0|I loved this book!  It made me look at my dog in a new way---what is she thinking???  It was well written and easy to read.  I recommend it hightly.
0316069906|3.0|First off, I didn't read the book but I've read a lot about it.  I tried to give it a neutral review.  I whole heartedly think factory farming is awful and wish I could avoid it all costs.  However vegetarianism/veganism didn't help my health at all and I found that meat/animal protein profoundly helped me recover from various health issues.<br />Again, I know that factory farming is nasty and local farms are the way to go etc...  I wish I could be a vegan, but when it comes to my health and well being vs the treatment of animals I choose MY health over a cow's any day.
0316069906|2.0|OK! I've been hit over the head with the sledgehammer of righteous, morality. I get it, Mr. Foer. If I choose to eat that sirloin burger, I will have to eat it while being burdened with a guilt of biblical proportions. At seventy years old I have tried to eat a fresh, wholesome and healthy diet, one that protects me from high blood pressure, and my husband from more cardiac problems. And I mean, a healthy diet - I make sure of it. I bought Mr. Foer's book because I feel strongly about food quality, and wanted more education on our food supply. After three blood-dripping chapters, I felt my very human-ness under attack because I had these taste-tingling urges for grilled salmon and roasted pork tenderloin. I am happy the author and his wife are adopting a vegetarian diet. But please, spare me the guilt-producing, twist-the-knife rhetoric. I will continue to fight against processed food, and fight for eating more fruits and vegetables. But I refuse to subject myself to the guts and gore you so very specifically articulate. I get it that you don't want to eat Lassie, your moral equivalent to eating animals. But please know, I just ate some cold, cooked shrimp. I followed it with a romaine salad, with blue cheese, walnuts, and apples. I didn't weep for shame.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I chanced upon the first episode of the first season thanks to late night channel surfing and insomnia, and right off the bat, I was HOOKED! I googled the show and came across the website for the show ([...]). Needless to say, I watched all the episodes in the first season within a span of 2 days! Having been a fan of Hercules and Xena the Warrior Princess (same team that brings you Legend of the Seeker), I am now an avid fan of this new series.    The episodes get better and better as the season wore on. The plots and twists really keep you glued to this series. I have not read the books, so I can't compare them, but the TV series is really awesome! I have just ordered the DVD for the first season and can't wait for it to arrive so that I can 're-live' the adventures again!
B000P0J0AG|5.0|Heat offers textured characters in what otherwise would be a a \\"cops and robbers\\" movie.  The networking of criminals and police is interesting in itself. Add the emotional toll taken on Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro, Val Kilmer, and Dennis Haysbert and their women, and the viewer sees the police and criminals as real people with real emotions.  Even the coldest melt. Pacino's and DeNiro's characters meet one-on-one over coffee, and the arch-enemies reveal their mutual respect for one another--and their dedication to their craft. A classic scene.
B002SEW5WW|2.0|On the whole, this was a disappointing follow-up to their excellent Dreaming Out Loud.  They attempt to compensate for the lack of depth in songwriting with a wide range of musical styles, none of which suit the band.  \\"All the Right Moves\\" is a worthy and catchy track, but will fail to retain the replay value of \\"Stop and Stare\\" or \\"Apologize.\\"  \\"All this Time\\" is the only other track I would recommend downloading.  It's a slow, heartfelt number; a quality largely lacking on the remainder of the album.  I feel that OneRepublic, in their quest to prove they are not who they've been defined as, have lost themselves.  Hopefully they will be able to recover from the weak response they are bound to receive after this effort.
B001UREJWM|5.0|Ok, so the band calls itself Heaven and Hell, but lets face, they can call themselves whatever they want, they will forever be Black Sabbath.  Nothing changes from this band whose members in the early 80's blasted many metal fans with ear splattering riffs, jams and precussions.  Dio, Iommi, Butler and Appice, the revival of Sabbath after Ozzy and Drummer Bill Ward depated.  The songs are exactly what you come to expect from Black Sabbath, heavy overtones, tempo changes, and dazzling guitar play.  The song \\"Bible Black\\" will one day be a classic and really takes the true Sabbath fan back to the beginning. This CD is a cant miss and if you get a chance, catch them on tour, they may have aged a little, but can still put on a great and LOUD show.

B002S0OBFK|5.0|Like it or not; this is the only movie that had the guts to take on a SAW sequel. Warner Brothers didn't have the guts to put TRICK R' TREAT against it so they dumped it on DVD. MGM couldn't muster up the courage to pull THE POUGHKEEPSIE TAPES out of where ever they have hid it to do battle with the SAW juggernaut either.     Not only did PA take on SAW but it kicked it's butt - badly. What I mean is it not only got better reviews but it out-grossed it by a sizeable margin and I think it's total gross is up to 100 million at this point. Not bad for a movie that costs only 15 thousand to make.     Face it - we would have been up to SAW 17 or 18 if this had not come out.     A final note which I think most will agree on: a movie theater is not the best place to see this. Picture watching this film at home, late at night, on a big screen tv with surround sound, and all the lights off. That's where this flick will really shine.     And let's be honest; the people who say this isn't scary probably don't get scared by any movies. Too bad for them, they are missing out on some fun!!!
B002QH2NUA|5.0|I have had the extreme pleasure of seeing Paul McCartney live in concert a couple of times, once in Madison Square Garden and also in Philadelphia during the same tour in 1990.  It was incredible seeing this living legend make the place go wild.  I own every DVD concert he has put out since then and though I love them all.....none of them really help you relive the experience of being there LIVE.  The problem was always the same:  too much fluff in between the songs, too much \\"production\\".  Clips of Paul walking around dressing rooms, talking to other celebrities, showing him traveling, etc etc.  The first couple of times it wasn't so bad and it was even kind of cool having all of those extras.  But after 3-4 Live DVD's exactly like that, I thought to myself \\"Damn Paul...just give us a straight forward, start to finish concert!\\"   Well folks...that is EXACTLY what McCartney has just given us with this new DVD concert and it is without a doubt his best one to date.      I got it in the mail yesterday, and I popped it into the player planning on only checking out the first couple of songs.  Well I could not turn it off and I sat there and watched the entire amazing performance.  The sound quality (5.1 DTS surround with my Bose surround sound) and the 1080P HD video quality were incredible.  Paul's AWESOME band was great as always, but most of all, Paul McCartney himself.  This guy just continues to blow me away!  The man is 67 years old, yet watching this concert...you simply can't believe that.  He still sings GREAT at this age and he can still rock!  He is in excellent physical shape and he was moving around that stage with the energy of a 30 year old.  Still incredible on the bass guitar, piano, electric and acoustic guitars...Paul does not disappoint.  The light show is also incredible as always.  I didn't even mind the the clips of the audience from the handheld cameras given to them for the show.  Those interspersed clips didn't distract because, again, this wasa complete show from start to finish without all of the production fluff I mentioned earlier.  You felt like they just started filming from the beginning and kept the cameras rolling on the same exact concert (even if they did edit in parts from one of the other three nights).  Everyone onstage must have worn the same exact clothing because you never noticed any obvious editing.  Anyway...just buy it!  I'm telling you, you will be glad you did!  Best concert DVD McCartney has ever done. 67 years old???  Unbelievable.  OUTSTANDING concert, Paul!

B002NWRMVS|3.0|...the distortion effect that they've added to the music is horrible!   I love Norah Jones. I'm a huge fan. I have all her albums, plus I've seen her in concert... but this is one annoying-sounding album.     Her voice is beautiful, and the songs are great, EXCEPT for the distortion effect. It makes it sound like an old-junky 1950's record or a dusty 70's 8-track or something horrible.    They should remove that effect and republish the album; it's THAT bad.     (my husband made me turn it off it was so bad sounding!)
B00000F14B|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable DVD, with excellent color and excellent quality.  I love the music in this musical.  Robert Preston does an incredible job as the con man who comes to town to start a boy's band.  The \\"76 Trombones\\" number is lots of fun.  And it's fun to see Ron Howard as a little boy.  Great musical.
B0009W5K0Y|4.0|After first becoming familiar with Paramore with \\"Brand New Eyes\\", I had to go back and pick up their debut.  \\"All We Know Is Falling\\" was released on July 26th of 2005, and while their first album is more subtle when compared to \\"Brand New Eyes\\", which reached out and grabbed me by the ears, ultimately they are both very good albums, and \\"All We Know Is Falling\\" is clearly a release which grows on the listener with each playing.    \\"All We Know\\" opens the album, with a solid piece which moves from fairly heavy to a more sedate bridge before returning to the heavier sound for the ending.  It is a goodbye to their former bass player, who was later to return to the band, and was the third single from the album.   \\"Pressure\\" is another solid piece about the pressures of being a teenager.  It was the first single from the album.  \\"Emergency\\" is a song about the state of modern relationships, and is one of my favorites on the album and the second single.  \\"Brighter\\" is a bit slower piece, dealing with the impending break-up of a relationship from the perspective of one who doesn't want it to end.  \\"Here We Go Again\\" finishes off the first half of the album.  This song is also about the break-up of a relationship, but no regrets expressed or loss felt.  This is the weakest of the songs on the first half of the album, which isn't hard to do considering how good the rest are.    \\"Never Let This Go\\" opens up the second half of the album much the way the first half closed, i.e. with a relationship ending song.  It is little doubt why Haley wrote \\"Emergency\\" with all these songs about break-ups.  At any rate, it is a good opening piece and starts off the second half well.  \\"Whoa\\" continues with the relationship songs, but this one isn't breaking up yet.  It is another solid piece and probably could have been released as a single.  \\"Conspiracy\\" is another very good song with exceptional vocals, the lyrics aren't very specific, but it appears to be dealing with the feelings mostteenagers have of being on the outside.  \\"Franklin\\" deals with the change in their home town.  Both the town, and their perception has changed.  \\"My Heart\\" is an interesting song as it could be a song about Haley's relationship with a man, or a song about her relationship with God.  The backing vocals at the end are unusual, and not my particular cup of tea, but they do create a unique feeling in the song.    Paramore on this album was Hayley Williams (vocals), Josh Farro (guitar, vocals), Zac Farro (drums), John Hembree (bass), and Jason Bynum (guitar, vocals).  Hayley Williams  is the main lyricist and shares the music credits with Josh Farro, with one piece co-written with future member Taylor York.  This album doesn't have anything which blows me away, but there are a lot of very good pieces, and all the songs are worth hearing.  It also grows on me a little each time I listen to it, which is something I like to have in an album.  Four stars and rising...
B001PR0YDA|4.0|From an artistic viewpoint, the new Robert Zemeckis film from the man who gave us THE POLAR EXPRESS, is another of his animated features using the motion picture capture technique that allows the actors to play several roles--and the cinematography is exceptionally well done.<br /><br />JIM CARREY, as miserly Ebenizer Scrooge, looks nothing like his real self. He's a perfect Scrooge, using his voice and mannerisms to great effect, never overplaying the role as you might expect he would.<br /><br />The visit from three spirits is more frightening than usual, since Zemeckis decided to throw everything he could into startling special effects--sometimes with very gruesome results. The sight of Marley's Ghost with a flapping jaw that has to be realigned by Marley is just one of the \\"extra\\" touches. Some of the \\"spirit\\" scenes are too intense for small children and more likely to frighten them than anything else.<br /><br />There are times when the story remains very faithful to the Dickens book, sometimes even word for word. But when Zemeckis decides to show off what the camera can do with flying aerial scenes zooming over Victorian London, it begins to stray a bit. Biggest stray is a chase scene that has a miniature Scrooge going through drain pipes to escape an oncoming coach and horses trying to run him down.<br /><br />The lovely score by Alan Silvestri blends perfectly with the on screen action and includes a number of traditional Christmas favorites. GARY OLDMAN and COLIN FIRTH do well in key supporting roles but it's really Carey's show all the way. He plays several main characters with great skill.<br /><br />Not quite as festive as you might expect, it's a darker version of Scrooge, handsomely executed so that many of the scenes look like Victorian illustrations from the novel.<br /><br />Warning: This is not a child's version of the tale. Parents should be advised that some of the content is too gruesome for young kids. Personally, I enjoyed it and I'm glad I stayed to hear Andreas Boccelli's beautiful voice over the end credits.<br /><br />This is your comment, you may delete or edit it.e over the end credits.

B001BPJJ9G|5.0|Basically, The Fall is complete eye candy with a compelling plot. The locations, the acting, the character development, all of it's nice as far as I'm concerned. I'm only sad the chocolate fountain scene didn't make the final cut, but you can't always get what you want.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|Since I'm a 64 year old Star Trek fan, I must say that this movie was GREAT!
B0028DRGDQ|3.0|I had the opportunity recently to catch [[ASIN:B001MVYUQQ Quarantine]], the 2008 American \\"re-do\\" of 2007's [REC]. So I said to myself, \\"why not give the original a look to see if they were on par with each other.\\" And [REC] was worth the look. But why do I call Quarantine a \\"re-do\\" instead of a \\"re-make\\", you ask? I'll get to that in a minute.<br /><br />{REC} is a very well done Spanish film by Jaume Balaguer&oacute; & Paco Plaza that kind of combines the idea of Rage virus infected maniacs from [[ASIN:B000VDDWEC 28 Days Later]] with the notion that zombies and demonic possession are nothing more than a mutated virus strain. Oh don't worry, I'm not spoiling anything here!<br /><br />I mean really...both movies ultimately offer no better explanation for the origin of what's going on than any of its predecessors. I'd say that [[ASIN:B000YPUFAQ Resident Evil]] & 28 Days Later make the best attempts to suggest origins for why \\"zombies\\" are walking the earth, but even those leave the door wide open to prequels or sequels that change the whole idea of \\"what started it all.\\"<br /><br />So enter [REC] with a somewhat unique explanation (a la videogame-esque recording device found by the characters late in the film) of why zombies haunt this story. But before that device is found, our characters go through a Hell of being trapped in a multi-level apartment building with some pretty ghastly creatures. 99% the same story for Quarantine.<br /><br />The camera work in both movies is unfortunately in the same vein as some recent films that tried to present a more realistic environment with a single hand-held camera capturing all the action, a la [[ASIN:B00001QGUM Blair Witch]], [[ASIN:B0018QCXGY Cloverfield]] or [[ASIN:B001CDLARQ Diary of the Dead]]. But all that the hand-held camera work really does is annoy the living dead out of ya.<br /><br />Somewhere between 2007 & 2008, little known Director John Erick Dowdle basically stole [REC], inserted American actors and released [REC] as a \\"re-do\\" in America under the title Quarantine. Yes...I said \\"re-do\\" as opposed to \\"re-make\\". A re-make is when a director takes an older film, sometimes even a classic, and makes it better.

1932100660|5.0|this book is not about going vegan or vegetarian, it's about providing facts, and that scares a lot of people.  the fact that what you eat and how that food got to your plate greatly impacts you is very important.  Just on the news this week they were talking about how 50% of the US population will be obese or overweight soon and how obesity overtaking smoking as the number 1 killer in America.    you don't need to stop eating meat to benefit from this book, but greatly cutting down on the amount and being very careful of where it comes from will be very beneficial.    what's great about this book is that it provides scientific data from decades of research and the study is still ongoing.    I'd also highly recommend the movie Food Inc which Martha Stewart just showcased on her show this week.

B001LV5OOY|5.0|Like many newer bands today, there's perceived musical influences amongst stated ones. White Lies are young, and say they don't sound like anyone. While taking these Brits at their word may work for some, points of reference are a must for description. Listening 'To Lose My Life' brought many sounds and quips from musical memory, but flattery may not be the best compliment here. A Flock of Seagulls and Icicle Works guitar riffs; The Cars whimsical keyboards; Echo & Bunnymen's strings; amongst A-Ha's and Tears For Fears like vocals makes first listen to almost schizophrenic. Rounding off with similar gigs like The Editors and Franz Ferdinand tops off schizo sound with pleasant confusion. Consecutive listenings however, they start growing on you - with increasing talent and sound all their own. Highly recommended for curious musical connoisseurs.
B002VECM72|5.0|Sandra Bullock portrays this role with an excellent touch.  When she has to be a smart #ss, she doesn't hold back and demonstrates sufficient confidence in her own beliefs that she comes off perfectly!  This is not the comedienne, this is a confident, talented woman with a heart (the character she plays) and in playing this role with honesty, she makes the audience laugh, applaud, cheer, and cry at different times.    Tim McGraw performed perfectly as her loving, intelligent, compassionate husband who recognized that he was married to a unique jewel.    Quinton Aaron plays a wonderful, mysterious, quiet young man who can 'speak' with just a small gesture of his face.  We have a wonderful new actor on the scene now!  His acting reminded me of the sensitivity and excellence of Rob Brown (Finding Forrester, Coach Carter and The Express.)    I plan to own this as soon as its out on DVD.  The sweetness, humanity and poignancy in this movie reminds me of \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\".  The night I saw it at a theater in Mississippi, the theater sold out and many of the people around me said they had driven there from towns almost 100 miles away because those theaters were sold out too.  This movie opened the same night as that New Moon thing; I was proud that people packed the theater to see The Blind Side!  This film is bound to receive at least 1 or 2 Academy Award nominations and become a classic about family relationships, compassion, and love.  Go see it!  I believe you'll want to see it again and again!  Thanks, Sandra!!!

B000ZELISO|5.0|Wow, I laugh at the people who rate movies poorly based on what they read in a book. Books don't normally make for a very good film in the first place. The best thing I feel to do is to separate the two ideas of film vs. book. Two different thing and therefore must be viewed in two different ways. It's like comparing apples/oranges, Tupperware/tool boxes, Ford Temp/private jets etc.    I watched this one before I saw the others so I went back and watched 1 all the way up to this (I finally understand it). In comparison to the first 3 the films do get better as they progress; less character development and more of the good stuff. If you're wondering, I'm not much into reading fantasy books. I'd much rather read a physics text, engineering text, or even a dictionary (something educational). I get my fantasy time from watching movies.     Anyway, I thought the film was good and I'd buy the blu-ray for $17

B002H3F7F6|5.0|Several reviewers have mentioned Sting's vocal quality.  Personally, I enjoy a range of voices, including those which aren't perfect.  Somehow, that adds to the authenticity of this CD for me.  Sting isn't off-key; it's just that his voice has a bit of a roughened quality.  The music offers an acoustic vibe, stripped-down like a tree without its leaves.  I love that.  But then, I enjoy monastic music (chant), Taize, and good folk.<br /><br />It's not perfect.  I could do without the backup singers on \\"Christmas at Sea\\" because they sound a bit cheerful for my taste, and perhaps I have a few other quibbles... but overall, this is a beautiful CD and a welcome addition to the overstuffed cheer-ballads in bloated Christmas music.

It is clear that doing a biography with the material available would have been insufficent but Ms Horan found a way to make this tale fascinating.<br />Mamah is a finely chiseled portrait of a strong woman confronted with an equally strong Wright.

B002P7UCMC|5.0|Having been an avid Rammstein fan since earlier this decade, this has been my most anticipated album release for quite some time.  The tension and excitement built over the course of the past 3 years as Rammstein fans awaited the successor to 2005's \\"Rosenrot\\", which had left many fans dissapointed.  Although I did enjoy Rosenrot, to me it wasn't quite up to the quality of previous gems like \\"Mutter\\" and \\"Reise Reise\\", so I, like many other Rammstein fans, was quite curious as to the direction their next project would take.  I can say now, upon a full month of exposure to \\"LIFAD\\", that the word \\"dissapointment\\" hasn't so much as even crossed my mind, and that this album represents a glorious congregation of all their previous styles, with a few new surprises to keep things fresh.      Many had dismissed the album outright before its release upon hearing the first single, perhaps mistaking its style as being representative of the rest of the album, but this is not so.  Although fun and catchy, the song in question is a true stand-out on the album in terms of its style, and should not be used as a barometer to guage how one will enjoy the rest of the songs.  LIFAD's style seems to traverse Rammstein's entire discography, with anthemic industrial grinders like the opener \\"Rammlied\\", fast paced, balls-out rockers like \\"Waidmanns Heil\\", and softer acoustic ballads like the album's closer \\"Roter Sand\\", or the contagious \\"Fruehling in Paris\\", which features a chorus sung in French.      Musically, it is my opinion that this is Rammstein's finest effort overall, with vocalist Till Lindemann and drummer Christoph Schneider in specific exhibiting their finest performances yet.  It is also their most diverse, in terms of the variety of styles you hear from one song to the next.  Thematically, it is surely their darkest, with the entire album representing a sort of tongue in cheek examination of love at its most extreme (take the title \\"Liebe ist fuer alle da\\", meaning \\"Love isthere for everyone\\"), including a song dedicated to the Fritzl case from Austria.      Rammstein fans should more or less know what to expect from this album, and those seeking that traditional sound will not be dissapointed, as this somewhat represents a return to form for the band after the varying musical styles attempted with the last two albums.  Although some may not figure LIFAD to be the best Rammstein album ever made, it must surely be considered to be amongst their finest, and is certainly one of the best albums I've heard from any band in quite some time.  A true ambassador of their genre, and a testament to the power of hard music.  Highly recommended!
B002K0WBXW|4.0|When not handling his business in superhero cinema, Ryan Reynolds tends to roam into the comedy genre. THE PROPOSAL is his latest romantic comedy and this time he plays opposite Sandra Bullock, an actress I used to follow onscreen, but not lately. Sandra Bullock made an impression on me with [[ASIN:B0006GANOQ Speed (Widescreen Edition)]] and [[ASIN:6304765266 While You Were Sleeping]], and even with [[ASIN:630460288X Demolition Man]], but all those flicks are more than a few years ago and, somewhere along the way, I just stopped watching her. Here, she goes against type but manages to bring back all the elements which had originally made her so endearing.<br /><br />It's about tyrannical, much-loathed book editor Margaret Tate suddenly learning that she's on the verge of being deported back to Canada. Grasping at straws, she bullies her long-suffering assistant Andrew Paxton into pretending that they're engaged, their upcoming \\"nuptials\\" the key to her remaining in New York. It's not too long before things get crazy out of hand, and Margaret finds herself flying out to Sitka, Alaska on a weekend trip with Andrew to celebrate his grandma's birthday. So cue the usual romantic stuff, with a very suspicious immigration officer closely keeping tabs on the pretend relationship.<br /><br />Thing is, there's nothing new in this one. THE PROPOSAL is actually a by-the-numbers picture with a contrived premise, and so, as it often turns out, whether the film sinks or swims hinges on the compatibility and appeal of the two leads. I have friends who don't dig Reynolds, and nowadays I rarely get swayed by Bullock's charms. But I happen to think that these two actors, in this movie, click together. The mutual dislike of their characters is palpable and very enjoyable, and, honestly, there's nothing quite so exquisite as when two people who really don't like each other end up crashing into each other while both are bare-nekkid. Returning to the down side, predictable sub-plots wing its way towards you and, by gum, there's even that most cliched of cliches: a frantic, last-minute dash to the airport. I was amused, but not too startled at the revelations regarding Margaret. We all suspected, going in, that she just had to have a softer side. And to check off on the \\"endearing character quirk\\" angle, Margaret happens to harbor a hidden fondness for rap music - and specifically for Lil Jon and Rob Bass & DJ E-Z Rock. That's sweet.<br /><br />By now, Ryan Reynolds has this kind of role down pat. The bemused look, the pinched expression, the deadpan delivery, he's a natural at all that stuff. Several of his insults directed at Bullock are very funny. His character also has a side story centering on his bitter estrangement from his father. Mostly, though, Reynolds serves as the framing device with which to show off Sandra Bullock's pretty good performance. I've never seen Bullock in a mean dragon lady part (it's like seeing Norman Rockwell beat up a child), but I must say she's surprisingly effective and convincing and callous as heck. It's almost a shame that this particular genre demands that she eventually demonstrate a warmer, more vulnerable side to her. I was getting a kick out of her being this icy, horrifically insensitive boss.<br /><br />THE PROPOSAL will have you wallowing in despised boss revenge fantasies and just maybe, even fantasies of a near nude Sandra Bullock, who may be in her forties now but, dang, she shows off a sexy bod. Okay, some of the scenes are cringe-worthy, the two most embarassing ones probably being the bachelorette party dude stripper dance and Betty White doing some sort of uncomfortable tribal dance. But this last one actually becomes funny when Betty asks Sandra Bullock to join in, and Sandra - well, you just have to see it.<br /><br />3.5 out of 5 stars for this one.its way towards you and, by gum, there's even that most cliched of cliches: a frantic, last-minute dash to the airport.

1840220554|5.0|The Complete Novels of Jane Austen is a good buy for any Austen fan. It includes every one of Jane Austen's stories in one book. Prior to each novel there is a title page separating the stories. The book is obviously a decent size since all of Austen's stories were kinda lengthy. I would recommend this to any Austen fan that would like the convenience of having all Jane Austen's novels at an easily accesible way.

B0025KVLV0|5.0|What is a classic? Good question, and certianly one to be considered when, like me, you love your music, and are serious about writting about the music you love. To discuss and understand it and maybe, just maybe, help someone hear an album in a way they have not before, because the same will be done for you.  It is not showing your mussles, but  sharing your last cigarette with a buddy<br /><br />To me, a classic can be an album that has so much historical symbolism, it gets the label. Or, it can be music that is just so intrinsicly good, it also grabs the brass ring. It can also, of course, be both.<br /><br />Well, Let It Be absoluitely gets the first badge. When the best rock band, ever, implodes before your ears, this is that sound. Don't beleive me: Paul hated what was done to \\"Long and Winding Road.\\" John hated the origional tapes so much he went outside the Beatle circle and gave them to Phil Spector. The Beatles even had to return to EMI, after the smoke cleared a little, and make Abbey Road. Even they did not want to go out with what was then to be called Get Back.<br /><br />\\"Get Back,\\" the song, is great--1963 style Beatles rock with 1969 technology and craft. The same can be said for \\"Dig a Pony,\\" \\"I Me Mine,\\" and the title track.<br /><br />\\"I Got a Feeling.\\" is the type of Delaney and Bonnie roots rock that would have carried the Beatles into the seventies, had things been different. A rocker, but listen to that scale that is the middle eight, and Paul's singing--again, like the young man in the Cavern but with the experiance of a master. As always, with the Beatles, even the simple is never really simple.<br /><br />But then you have \\"Two Of Us,\\" \\"Maggie May.\\" \\"Across The Universe\\" is great, but seems patched together by Spector's production, as does \\"Long And Winding Road.\\" None of these tracks are bad by any standard, except for that of the Beatles.<br /><br />These guys were exhausted, and hearing this album leads you to understand why they broke up.

6305428557|5.0|This is a charming story of two rival community leaders, the preacher & the bartender, who inspire the townspeople to raise a hill into a mountain.  There are lots of chuckles as the Welsh make fun of the English and vice versa.  There's a bit of sadness too, as the story takes place during the Great War, and we feel the loss of the men who are away to fight as well as those who have returned home shellshocked.  The movie is fairly clean, although there is innuendo and occasional mild language.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I just finished watching the dvd and have to say that this movie way, way exceeded my expectations. The story was an absolute stroke of genious. It masterfully brought together the elements of the old show with a new youth and vitality in a way took the old characters to a new level and opened the door to a limitless new beginning. A+ for all the writers involved. And coudos to the actors for pulling it off. Great character developement. Great excitement level. Such a masterful foundation has been layed here, that this aspect of the franchise could last for many years to come. I absolutely want to see more of these people and how their relationships develop as they continue to save the universe from destruction and uphold all those traits that make the human race worth while. This movie is inspirational and uplifting - which is what hollywood should be about.

B0000009SF|5.0|Most people rest after an accident or being a crime victim. Frank Zappa recorded a big band album<br /><br />Zappa got thrown off stage by a crazed fan in 1971 and this left him in a wheelchair for almost a year. If you notice his deeper voice, it is from his larynx being crushed during the assult. Unable to tour he assembled this band.<br /><br />The five peices here bring Zappa's maximus sound to fruition with a fantastic big band, a big band taylored for Frank's music. This is no mere professional jazz date. The sliding trombones and needling muted trumpets bring the irony you expect from Zappa, and on the guitar solos, Zappa is as usual brillant.<br /><br />There is blues as well as bigger conceptul pieces. All work as jazz, big band music, and Zappa music, and all of it exsists on all three levels.<br /><br />But for me the highlight is \\"Blessed Relief,\\" a sunningly placid piece; one of the few of Zappa's I can name with no irony. The only regrettable thing about this song is that it, mysteriously, did not become a live staple

Even though the two son's in the movie were exposed to such danger, I still wanted to trade places with them and live this adventure. It's a fun film and  I really enjoyed the chemistry between the actor's. They should be very proud of their performances and there is no doubt that this was the movie that launched quite a few careers. Big Bites and blood squirts....oh, and laughter.

I would recomend this movie for all.
B00078XGRO|4.0|This was probably the only Next Generation movie I really liked.  I mean, it's awesome.  I thought it was the only one that was as good as the television show.  I would put this at the top tier of all Star Trek movies, just below \\"Wrath of Khan\\" and the 2009 reboot.  It still remains one of the best Sci-Fi movies of all time.  Now the film is not perfect.  There are a few problems I had with it.  Most of those problems have to do with continuity issues between the movie and the TV show.  I'll get into those later in the review.    The movie centers around the Borg, the half-machine, half-organic aliens from the series.  Considering that they were probably the most popular villians from the series, it made sense to make them the villians of the new movie.  The plot involves the Borg going back in time to the year 2063.  This is supposedly the year when we first invent the warp engine and meet the Vulcans for the first time.  The Borg want to stop that from happening, and they want to enslave the human race.  The Enterprise follows them back through time and blow up the Borg ship.  The Borg beam over to the Enterprise and begin assimilating the crew.  So you've got a movie that has the Borg, and time travel.  Doesn't get any better than this.    At this point the movie branches off into two plot lines.  One plot involves Picard and most of the crew trying to defeat the Borg on the ship.  The other involves Riker and the rest of the crew on the planet helping Zephram Cochrane, the man who is supposed to invent warp speed.  He is unsure about his calling, and Riker has to convince him to go through with his flight.  Both of these plots are excellent.  In fact, each one by itself is good enough for a whole movie.  So my question is, why didn't they make one movie about the Borg, and another movie about someone trying to screw up the timeline?  Putting both these plots in one movie made the movie awesome, but it made this movie hard to top.  Of the two Next Generation films that came after this movie, neither one of them measured up tp this one.  Maybe for the later movies, they should have used villians from the series again.  But that's a whole different review.    About halfway through the movie, the villian of the movie is introduced.  The Borg queen.  This is my only big problem with the movie.  On the show, it is established that the Borg exist as one consciousness, entity, and there are no leaders or subordinates.  So all of a sudden, they have a queen?  On the behind the scenes stuff, one of the writers or producers said that not having a main villian worked on the show, but it didn't really work in a movie.  I can kinda see where they were coming from, but they really needed to follow the continuity of the source material.  The Borg queen just makes no sense.  The fact that she exests makes no sense, and most of her dialogue makes no sense.  They say that she was on the ship with Picard when he was turned into a Borg and the TV episode \\"Best of both Worlds\\".  At the end of the episode, the Borg ship is destroyed.  If the queen was supposedly on it, then she would have been destroyed as well.  When Picard comments on this, she responds with \\"You think in such 3-dimensional terms\\".  What does that mean?  Is that supposed to have a meaning?  Whatever.    But thankfully, the Borg Queen doesn't have all that much screen time.  So if you can just get past her annoying presence and the continuity errors, you should enjoy this movie.  In fact, this is one of the three Star Trek movies that I think could appeal to mainstream audiences (the other two being voyage home and the 2009 reboot).  Most of the charcter development is great, the action is great, the special effects are great, almos teverything about this movie is great.  If this movie had had a strongerr villian, this would probably be my favorite Star Trek movie, even better than Wrath of Khan and the 2009 reboot.
B000002KCI|5.0|This album is what you'd expect from the cover: Neil Young and Crazy Horse cranking out some rocking, heartfelt, raw country-rock songs with brooding guitar solos, and simple and solid backing instrumentation. With one or two (great) acoustic songs thrown in.     You get that, and nothing less.     Like a lot of Neil Young albums, this is for when life has got you down, and it's time for a change. The lyrics are real, the mood is upset, but sincere.     Cortez is obviously a highlight, with some seriously soul-wrenching guitar work from Neil Young. A classic in its own right.     All of the other songs will hold their weight in this album. If you've heard Neil in the past, and liked him, you'll like this album. Only don't expect to find anything that would fit on \\"Harvest\\". This is raw, honest, messy rock music.
B000RF7XYO|5.0|Excellent service, the product was in excellent shape and it came to my home in a very short time.  .[[ASIN:B000RF7XYO Elizabeth (Spotlight Series)]] Cate Blanchett, is Elizabeth to a T. Her portrayal of the Queen was excellent.  Geoffrey Rush was great in his role as Elizabeths advisor.  A real good movie and I would recomend it to all who like history and action, drama.
0345495004|4.0|I read this book upon recommendation from a friend--it was the recommendation that kept me going as the first few chapters were somewhat dry and tedious.  I completely missed the pull and attraction that Mamah Borthwick Cheney felt toward Frank Lloyd Wright and why either one would leave his/her family and risk so much to be together.<br /><br />As the story went on and I gained additional insight into Mamah, her intellect and insight came much more into focus as did her reasons for leaving her family.  In spite of this, I still had trouble understanding the attraction to Frank Lloyd Wright.  While clearly brilliant and talented, he seemed to be a pompous and dishonest individual.<br /><br />Since this is historical fiction, it is written around factual information about the situations that surrounded these two individuals.  However, I knew nothing about Mamah Borthwick or her relationship with Frank Lloyd Wright prior to reading this book and was completely shocked and stunned by the ending.<br /><br />It was only in how Mr. Wright responded to the events that unfolded at the end of the story that made me see beyond the arrogance into a complex individual who had enormous respect and great love for Mamah Borthwick.<br /><br />After finishing Loving Frank, I wanted to learn as much as I could about these two individuals, especially Mamah Borthwick, and the events that surrounded the novel's ending.  This is generally a sign of a well-written piece of historical fiction.
B002VECM40|5.0|Precious Jones (Gaboure Sidibe) is an overweight black girl from Harlem who's life is a living hell. She lives with a hateful, abusive mother (Monique) who is constantly telling her how stupid and ugly she is. After becoming preganant with her second child, Precious is sent to an alternative school. Her new teacher (Paula Patton) recognizes her potential and starts to give her the love and attention she so desperately needs. Gradually Precious starts to gain self-confidence and take the necessary steps to improve her life.    This is the type of movie that a mediocre director could have turned into a cliched melodrama. But Lee Daniels instead creates a near masterpiece. The artsy dream sequences that feature Precious' rich fantasy life are nice. But it is really the intense moments of drama, especially between Precious and her mother, that pack an emotional wallop. Gaboure Sidibe and Monique provide two of the best acting performances of the year. Also excellent are the classroom scenes, as Precious and the other girls work towards giving up their hard bitten ways and being able to trust each other. Paula Patton is also outstanding as the teacher who gives them hope. I won't give away all the \\"unrelenting circumstances\\" faced by Precious. But even the most cynical will be left cheering in the end. This one of the best movies of the last several years and receives my highest recommendation.
B002BFIN6K|5.0|It is difficult to describe Rachmaninoff's playing. Words alone do not do justice to it. I will begin by mentioning that people who heard him play said that he just did not play wrong notes, ever. This is obvious given the total transparency of his delivery. All the notes are there, played with utter clarity, grouped according to their role in the phrase, and animated by feeling, expression, and utter musical sense. He takes a phrase and molds it exquisitely, plays with the rhythm as if creating it. All along, the different inflexions, the hierarchy of tones within a phrase, the subtle nuance, the attention to harmony, vertical as well as horizontal, the rhythmic creativity, all aspects of his performance make the listener feel that he is witnessing the creation of the piece.<br /><br />In this disc I strongly prefer the Kreisler, all the Rachmainoff pieces, and the Mendelssohn. While the Bach is of course totally understandable and makes musical sense, we are used today to more historically oriented performances, and yet the Bach is beautifully played. Nothing that Rachmaninoff touches is devoid of magic and life.
B002HWRYJE|1.0|Done seen this movie twice and it is crap. I have been a trek fan longer than Jar Jar Abrams has been alive and since he admitted he was no fan then we know why we got what we got. People say it is a fresh start, but I see rehashed elements from all the other Trek movies past. The ending is the same as the last two films where we finally get aboard the bad guys ship was a last minute fight. Missed opportunities for some great space battles (the Enterprise arriving after the battle at Vulcan matching the lack of battle in Insurrection when we come back from Picard on the Baku planet to Riker and the Enterprise is already damaged smoke coming from its naucells, not seeing how it managed to get damaged). The slap stick humor of Sulu not being able to get the Enterprise into warp matches some of the more child like humor of Star Trek 5 - it is humor that is more forced into the story instead of coming naturally with the story line like in Star Trek 4.  And even before the time line change takes place we have the Kelvin which seems to carry 800 people. Without the time line change that would mean starfleet started building smaller ships by Pikes time in The Cage where his ship only carries 203 people, not to mention the more advance technology with life sign tracking system on the Captain of the Kelvin (remember, until Nero attacks the Kelvin there is yet no time line change so this more advance technology violated continuity). Other continuity if the scene had not been deleted - Kirks older brother is named Johnny? It was George Samuel Kirk Jr. Remember he was born before Nero showed up so no time line change to cause a change in his name.)  I have liked every star trek series there has been. TOS is still my favorite. I can see where people did not like DS9, it was dark for a star trek series but it still had its moments. I have liked all first ten movies. Nemesis was my least favorite because it was too dark for a trek movie ( my least favorite till Star Trek 11).  This is the worse star trek ever because of a lack of knowledge and care by the people who control being executives at Paramount and J.J. Abrams. The most illogical thing out of this screwed up mess is why did Nimoy have anything to do with it. Was He broke? Shatner has been cordial about not being in the film, but I just think it is because he did not like the story. His novel was a far superior take on Kirk and Spocks first meeting. I would have liked the film more if they did a straight remake instead of trying to connect it to the original story line. On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being best I give it a - 2.
B00005A3KS|5.0|Point Break is an amazing, well-thought out movie with Patrick Swayze(whom we will miss), and Keanu Reeves.  I would highly recommend this film as it is enjoyable.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|EDIT:  I am raising my rating on this album to 5 stars because I just realized that it is four years old and it STILL sounds fresh every time I listen to it - including right at this very moment.  That is serious quality.  If you just picked up their new album \\"Native\\" and are looking to complete your collection, please add this.  Immediately.<br /><br />I was introduced to OneRepublic by a friend of mine who lent me their first CD.  I wasn't overly impressed at first, but as time went on, I appreciated it more and more.  I also realized I had heard of the frontman Ryan Tedder waaaaay before Timbaland got a hold of \\"Apologize\\" (which, imo, he gets too much credit for - the original's not much different from the remix) and I was thrilled he'd finally gotten his break.  This kid is CRAZY talented (vocalist, producer, songwriter, and he plays 4 instruments!) and that kind of talent can't stay secret for too long.  Before I knew it, I was playing \\"Dreaming Out Loud\\" constantly and it's still on regular rotation.  So it was with little hesitation that I picked up their latest effort, and I was not disappointed.  The group has managed to retain their signature sound while still demonstrating growth.  While there were a couple of tracks on \\"Dreaming Out Loud\\" that sounded too similar, here, each tune is distinctive.  Every time I listen to the CD, I have a new favorite (today it's \\"Good Life\\") and I love that it continues to surprise me.  \\"Made For You\\" opens the CD and I knew it was a hit when I was walking around singing it after only one listen!  \\"Secrets,\\" \\"Everybody Loves Me,\\" \\"All The Right Moves,\\" and \\"All This Time\\" are also standouts, but I can't say there are any truly weak tracks.  It will suit your mood - regardless of what your mood is.  Overall, I am VERY happy with my purchase.  This one will remain in rotation for quite a while as well.  Can't wait to heare the new songs live.  Bravo!
B002C6K7N0|3.0|When I was waiting for the Endgame release, I was hearing reviews like \\"Its back to there roots, similar to Rust In Peace. It could not be further from the truth, Endgame is a good album but I would have called it The System Has Failed 3. I was expecting a faster album but considering Mustaines age Im asking for too much. I would only buy to complete your Megadeth catalougue.

B002HWRZH0|4.0|I loved the movie...I like the model.  But, Amazon and QMx are GUILTY of deceptive advertising.  I am still thinking about returning this.  The Advertisement and the very certificate itself says that the model is \\"screen-accurate\\"  meaning, every detail of the ship you see on the movie is found in the model.  The model is supposedly made from the movies CGI reference.  But, this is outright false.  Yes, it is a \\"representation\\" of the movie's enterprise, but it is NOT screen accurate.  I would guess its details are only about 70% of the detail of the movie/CGI version--AT BEST. Take one look at the movie and the enterprise shuttle bay doors--lots of details.  Also, lots of details on the Nacelles.  This model, the shuttle bay door is smooth, the nacelles are missing several of the distinctive lines...i could go on and on.      It is VERY sturdy and well constructed, but it is not screen accurate.      I am still giving it four stars because of its craftmanship and construction...
B00005RZV4|5.0|I've always had an affinity for live albums because I believe it was the rawest performance of music that the artist can produce. Since a studio is absent, it's impossible to recreate the intricate structuring and \\"noise\\" that NIN is known for, so they strip it back. \\"And All That Could Have Been\\" is a raw and stripped back catalog of NIN's most accessible songs. The energy of the band (especially Trent) is definitely felt when listening to this record. Its aggression can be heard and the anger is felt.     Starting off the set with a loud and in-your-face Terrible Lie boils the blood and excites the spirit. The band then moves on to another Pretty Hate Machine single, Sin, that is just as abrasive as its studio brethren. Trent then dives into a few Downward Spiral classics and slowly transitions to The Fragile. His performance of The Great Below is nothing but epic. He then ends the set with the dark and soul-wrenching Hurt. The live performance of Hurt is just as powerful and emotional as it is on Downward Spiral and it serves as a fitting end to a phenomenal concert.     The DVD of \\"And All That Could Have Been\\" is highly recommend as a companion to this record. For you get to not only hear and feel the intensity of the performance, but you can see it also. This is one of the rawest live albums you'll encounter, as as a NIN fan, I highly recommend it.
B002MW50KO|5.0|This is a wonderfull collection of Christmas music that truly does warm the heart.Great fun and forget the negative critiscism of Bob's voice not being up to it, his voice brings a new dimension from the usual sweetly sick approach to most collections for this season.The band and Bob are having fun and the minute the laser hits the CD so does the listener.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Wow!  I am so glad I made this purchase.  I read this book in high school, or was assigned to do so, anyway.  High school to me was a blur and I don't remember a whole lot about it, including the details of this book.  I couldn't appreciate it then.  I picked the book up, again, about a year ago.  I loved it from the start and it got better and better, and it had a happy ending.  I'm not an avid reader but this book will always be one of my favorites.  It's classy, rich, and a must read.    I shied away from watching this movie because I didn't want it to destroy the book like so many remakes of any kind sometimes do.  Well, my avoiding this movie was totally unnecessary.  This movie is fantastic!  It captured all the characters very well, in particular Elizabeth and Darcy.  I will say that whilst watching it for the first time and even at the end of the movie it felt rushed, but what do you expect from a two-hour movie based off of a 400 page novel.  It's just because I loved the book so that the movie seemed swift; I wanted every line of the book to be developed.  I can't tell you how many times I've watched this movie after having watched it the first time.  I love movies and it has become my new favorite.  As much as the book is a must-read, this movie is a must-see.  You need to own it.  You won't be disappointed.    Long live the classics!
B002RBZ13Q|5.0|Just saw them playing in San Juan, PR. It was a great concert and this Blu Ray is an excellent presentation of this tour!! If u like The Killers this is a must have!!
0375434526|5.0|I loved this book.  It is a typical Dan Brown book where you couldn't put it down.  I made the mistake of reading other reviews before reading the book and one person decided to tell us all about the ending...what an idiot. I guess he thought he was so interesting and intelligent that he kept going on and on about his borish opinion. While reading the book, I kept thinking about the ending.  Luckily, it really didn't ruin it for me. I would recommend this book to those of you who loved the Di Vince Code and Angels and Demons.
B000002AGY|5.0|Just wonderful.

B000MRNWII|5.0|This DVD is of a concert she did in Lisbon, playing to the home team. She hits the ball out of the park! Mariza loves poetry and she loves sharing it with others in a most powerful way. Her performance leaves my bones vibrating like the strings of a cello. Be sure to read the lyrics in English and Portuguese at Mariza's Official Website. Click on \\"english\\", then on \\"lyrics\\". It helps also to learn a few Portuguese words so you don't lose your place while listening to the song.   Do not confuse this DVD with the one that comes with her CD of the same concert. That disc, also very worthwhile, is a documentary about Fado music.  The last two lines of \\"Recusa\\" read,\\"Entao eu nao sou fadista / Eu sou mesmo o proprio fado\\" (!) When you translate that while listening to her sing it, you will know something profound about Mariza.

Walter's Playing style has been copied and his singing as well.   He was the man behind MUDDY WATERS'Success as well. There is not a bad tune on this cd. As a blues guitarist myself ' I can appreciate Walters playing ability. He was smooth without being overbearing. He knew when to lay back and when to Kick the solos up a notch. HE truly was the Best there ever was !    Highest Regards.. FAT DANNY Bennett.

B000P0J0AG|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS VIOLENT - but, if you can get past that, you will find a truly AWESOME cynematic experience and epic performances by an all-star cast; it is an entirely new genre: it's not the traditional \\"cop\\" movie (like Lethal Weapon or Die Hard, where we instinctively root for the law), nor is it the traditional \\"gangster\\" movie (like Casino or Goodfellas, where we find ourselves sympathetic to the \\"bad guys\\").  Rather, time is split in this film, focusing almost equally on the lives of the \\"good\\" and the \\"bad\\" guys.  So, who is the protagonist and who is the antagonist here?  We see \\"good\\" guys sometimes doing \\"bad\\" things, and we see \\"bad\\" guys trying to do what would otherwise be considered the \\"right\\" thing.  At its essence, Heat is a story about two powerful, determined men on opposite sides of the law: Neil is a career thief, who has never allowed anything/anyone into his life that he couldn't leave behind in an instant, if he felt the heat closing in; and Vincent, a driven detective, whose devotion to his job leaves him no time for his family.  The film shows us how each man is the source of the other's misery - but when they collide, neither one is willing back down!  An all-star cast + a \\"signature\\" Michael Mann ending = a very powerful movie!
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|I love dan brown's books and this one is okay. Not his best book. when the book is about the story it is exciting but when the book stops to tell you about history is becomes like reading a text book. Same plot lines as his other books.
B000EWBKLC|3.0|Saw is a great movie, all the sequels can be skipped. However the video quality on the Blu-ray is pretty disappointing. Very grainy, never once really looked like a high-def video even in bright scenes. But what makes it even worse is that there are no extras whatsoever. No commentary, no deleted scenes, nothing besides some previews. Sad,sad,sad. At least it was cheap.

B001PR0YDA|2.0|I don't know how many of you caught The Christmas Carol Train Tour if it came by your city, which promoted this film.  Having experienced that along with Zemeckis' previous two CGI gems (The Polar Express and Beowulf), my wife and I were understandably excited about this.  After watching the film last night in IMAX 3-D, our opinions dropped harder than a rock in my broth.  Here is the dichotomy:<br /><br />Jim Carrey as Scrooge... Ok, I'm going to lose a lot of people here.  For the record, I think Carrey is fine actor, much better than many give him credit for.  However, like The Grinch, I felt he was miscast.  True, the confines of the character Scrooge greatly limited him to how crazy he can be.  However, since he also played multiple roles here, he was able to space out the energy bursts over several planes.  As Scrooge, he tried to grain his voice to sound like an old man, and it was so painfully artificial.  Also, his dialogue was often delivered in so many sporadic quips and chirps, it got really annoying.  If he was just a supporting actor in the film, I probably could have dismissed him.  However, since he was the main character, it was like a mosquito bite that just wouldn't stop itching.  His incessant laughing as the Ghost of Christmas Present was overboard and overlong.<br /><br />When Robert Zemeckis mentioned in an interview a few years ago that he felt all movies now should be done totally via CGI, I wanted to cringe.  There is nothing wrong with diverting to this format once in a while, but I am SO glad than most other directors have not adopted this idiotic philosophy.  Each scene in Zemeckis' last two CGI films were meticulously crafted and were crucial to the final product.  Here, however, I felt it needlessly dragged in many spots, especially with an overlong chase scene and the sequence with the Ghost of Christmas Future.<br /><br />The animation, especially the backdrop detail is truly amazing even getting down to Scrooge's nose-hairs.  However, unlike The Polar Express and Beowulf which had existed before merely as illustrations, Christmas Carol has been done on screen before several times and with a fine ensemble of actors to boot.  The Polar Express and Beowulf were fresh and original cinematic milestones.  This was not.  Having watched Alastair Sim, George C. Scott, and Reginald Owen pour their hearts out in earlier versions, they bring an emotional punch that no CGI character can EVER match.  Also with an over-emphasis on action scenes here, it seemed Zemeckis was sacrificing fluidity for the sake of showing what his computers can do.<br /><br />Apparently, a lot of people like this film.  So, it looks like I'm a lone wolf here.  However, opinions are like noses.  Everybody's got one, usually with a couple of holes in it.  This one's mine.press and Beowulf which had existed before merely as illustrations, Christmas Carol has been done on screen before several times and with a fine ensemble of actors to boot.

B002436WFI|5.0|It's always difficult to translate a book to screen because of time constraints, budgets, and inevitably, there are many things that are hard to visualize or generally considered just \\"unfilmable\\". And of course, every fan has an image in his/her head of what a character should look and sound like. Fortunately for me, I was new to the Terry Pratchett universe and didn't have any expectations for this made-for-TV film. I was aware of some of the radical changes the producers made, but overall, I had a great time watching the Color of Magic and laughed out loud quite frequently. It is a hilarious sendup of everything we think of when we think about the fantasy genre, wizardry, and magic. After watching this, I became very interested in Pratchett's work and read up on Discworld mythology, so I disagree with the reviewers that this film is only interesting to existing Pratchett fans.<br /><br />For the uninitiated, Discworld is a flat disc-shaped world held up on the backs of four elephants, who in turn are standing on a giant turtle traveling through space, a parody of ancient world creation myths, medieval astronomy, and cosmology. The story starts in Ankh-Morpork, a fictional city that looks like a dirty, crowded, industrial-age/Victorian English port, with a bungling and overly \\"mature\\" wizard named Rincewind (David Jason) being kicked out of the Unseen University after 40 years of ineptitude at learning even the most basic of spells. Soon Discworld's first ever tourist, Twoflower, arrives in town and after a series of comical mishaps, Rincewind is tasked, on pains of death, with keeping the naive (and wealthy) traveler safe. For die-hard Pratchett fans, they'll hate Sean Astin (of Sam Gamgee fame from [[ASIN:B000X9FLKM The Lord of the Rings]]) who is a white American being cast in the role of Twoflower, who is supposed to be Chinese and from the exotic \\"Counterweight Continent\\", home of a powerful and rich empire where the land is made of gold. His casting choice was supposedly due to a decision to bolster the film's international appeal, and I found him to be terribly miscast, never being able to shake from my mind his doofy look, naive simplicity, and demeanor from his LOTR character.<br /><br />For a made-for-TV movie, this film certainly feels like a much bigger budget film. The cast is filled with stars, though some only make minor appearances (like Jeremy Irons, who plays a lisp-afflicted Patrician). Tim Curry is particularly fun to watch as the hilariously evil and devious Trymon. Brian Cox is equally outstanding as the narrator, and Christopher Lee as the voice of Death. The CG is fantastic and rivals any Hollywood production, with some very lavishly detailed. The costumes and set designs are also very well done and believable.<br /><br />A highly entertaining and imaginative parody of the world and storytelling, I cannot recommend The Color of Magic strongly enough. For fans, it may be different from the book, but certain changes are required when translating to live action.

0060931736|3.0|If you are enthralled by the movie version, you probably will want  to  read this book to complete the experience. However, be mindful that it was written by a  teenager who had yet to fully  develop  her novelistic skills. The movie is far better. Still, the book is a very creative endeavor by a young woman and deserves  the  reader's attention. The  real question: How many of us had teachers like Jean Brodie, or close approximations?
1573300403|5.0|This was awesome! I purchased this and my whole family and I enjoy watching it over and over. It is priceless entertainment for our family. I am glad that I purchased this collection. I also purchased the Dangerous short films, Video history one, and the Michael Jackson Dangerous concert.. All are awesome and make a great collections. I would like to see a dvd with all of MJ's videos on one dvd instead of several here and there. For instant man in the mirror is on the number one's dvd.. I would have liked to have seen that on one of these collections. With that said, theses are still great to have. I don't know if I will purchase the number one's dvd. I think you will enjoy all the ones that I have mentioned. Get ready to be entertained.
B0017HMF6W|5.0|Years ago I owned the full screen version of this movie on laserdisc.  When the widescreen version of the movie came out on laserdisc I bought that.  I decided to do an A/B comparison of the 2 and to my surprise quickly realized that the wide screen version of the movie was just the full screen version with the top and bottom blanked out, and in fact the full screen version actually had more information on it (although nothing useful, just more fore ground and background).  I have never seen this on another movie, usually you see all the extra pans necessary to keep the action on the screen.  I was wondering if anyone else noticed this and if there are other similar movies out there.
B0027REDK2|5.0|For those of you who own the 2001 remaster of Rio, it's worth it to purchase this special updated remaster for many reasons.     First, the sound quality of this new remaster is far superior than the 2001 remaster. In comparing them I found the 2001 remaster to be hissy compared to this new realease.  The improvements to this new 2009 remaster eliminates the hiss and is punchier and more present than the 2001 version.     Secondly, which is really interesting is that this UK version is different than the 2001 remaster(which I thought was the UK version as well). Tracks like \\"Hold Back the Rain\\" and most of the others are mixed differently...and are better! Plus you have the U.S. mixes  which are interesting to hear(but I prefer the UK version on this 2009 remaster over them all). To top it off, you have the b-sides, demos, and night versions on disc two.     Speaking as a musician and a music fan, Rio is one of my favorite albums of all time and one that sounds fresh everytime I listen to it. This 2009 remaster is a must for any Duran Duran fan and a strong suggestion to those unfamiliar with this wonderful album. I hear they are going to give the same treatment to their debut album(which is a favorite of mine as well). This is an important album for rock history and if you happen to be a bass player, look no further...John Taylor rocks!
6304711905|5.0|A great cowboy movie. I particularly liked the authentic wardrobe. I'd rate this in the top 5. Val Kilmer was awesome as Doc Holliday.
006054094X|1.0|This is by far the worst book I have ever tried to read. The author starts from a good argument and then gets lost in interpreting any fact as an evidence in favor of his point of view, even when there would be thousands of more plausible explanations. I apologize for not being specific, but I think I have already lost too much of my time and patience trying to read this thing. However, if you are the kind of reader who likes UFOs and conspiracy stories, go ahead, maybe you will enjoy this book.
B000002JNJ|5.0|It came in a timely manner.  The product was in real nice shape.  The jewel case and the CD Booklet were in very nice condition.  The CD plays well and I didn't see any real significant scratches.
B00197POXG|4.0|I bought this as a gift for my wife (she totally loved it), and I like the package size (smaller than I tought), but the disks are somehow pressed inside de sleeves, and I think they can be easily damaged. Nice package design, but doesn't looks any close to leather. A very good item, overall, and it also arrived in a very good time.
1569242739|5.0|All I can say is I love, love, love this book!  My son cannot have gluten, eggs, or dairy.  Of course, that makes baking very hard for birthdays, holiday, etc.   But this book Rocks!  They have simple chocolate or vanilla recipes, but they also have more \\"fun\\" ones like Margarita Cupcakes.  I made those for my daughter's first birthday (she was born on Cinco de Mayo) and they were a huge hit.  One guest even made them for her boss's party a couple of weeks later.  Everyone raved about them.    I highly recommend this book to everyone, not just vegan/vegetarians.  It is great!
B001992NUQ|5.0|Fight Club is regarded by some as one of the greatest films of Norton & Pitt's careers. Many of us have been impatiently awaiting for the high definition release. Now that I finally own it; here are my impressions:<br />First, the packaging is by far one of the most beautiful...yes, I said beautiful, slip covers I have ever seen. It's really neat because it also flips open to reveal more art. The menu has a nice gag placed by David Fincher. Rest assured, you do not have a defective disc, rather a nice gag thrown in there. The picture quality is noticeably far superior than the DVD version without losing it's gritty look and feel. The sound is also very impressive and far superior than the DVD version. I highly recommend upgrading to this version if you own the DVD; if you don't, then by all means, this would make an ideal first entry into the movie.
B0019IB26I|5.0|It's been a long time since I last heard John Mayer, I used to listen to him all of the time but...I bought this cd & Continuum they are both great
B000ZLFALI|5.0|First of all I'm not going to break this movie down to what it means, it's plot, it's historical value, or whatever.  The thing is that it is a fun movie to watch.  I truly liked the visuals, and the music scenes.  I thought it was great on how the started doing \\"With a Little Help From my Friends\\" Beatles style, and finished it like the Joe Cocker version.  Very clever.  Musical scenes of \\"Let it Be\\", and \\"Strawberry Fields\\" were moving.  While the scenes of \\"Why don't We Do it in The Road\\", and \\"Helter Skelter\\" just rocked!  The absolute best song of this movie is \\"A Day in The Life\\" by Jeff Beck(studio version).  You only hear a bit of it.  I first hear the whole song on [...].   Now for those of you who hated this movie, or got offended by it like some reviewers did, first of all LIGHTENED UP  a bit.  I think it's awesome listening to Beatles tunes from a different perspective.  It's just entertaining folks, don't take it so seriously!
B002ONC9MS|3.0|A lushly photographed film that is both draggy and interesting.  Very handsome and photogenic stars.  Outside of the Middle East, it's unusual to see a Jew openly portrayed as a scoundrel, and this is probably one of the unique aspects here.  Also gives a nice feel for British private school life, family interactions, and social mores in the 1960's.
B00000IZOR|3.0|My son got this as a gift for his first birthday, and he likes it a lot.  Carries it all over the place with him.  In that respect, it's great.  In other respects, it leaves a bit to be desired.  First off, it comes with a LONG string to pull it around by - this of course is hazardous, everything I've ever read says not to give baby anything longer than 6\\".  So between that and a cat that eats string, the first thing I did was cut the string off.  After how long the pull string is, the string between the base and handset is only a few inches - no where near long enough for it to be on the floor, and my son to hold the handset to his ear.  Next, does anyone have a rotary phone anymore?  \\"I\\" barely remember them from my childhood!  I was sort of surprised to see that it wasn't a touch-tone phone, and then each button could have said the number or something.  But, in the end, my son loves it, so I guess that's the important part (now that it's been made safe).
B002Q4TKAY|5.0|If you've attended any of The Killers concerts then this is like reliving those precious memories. Also you receive a Live concert CD so you can have a concert in your iPod when you're on the go.
B002M2N9JI|2.0|This CD has some good songs but they all start sounding the same after a short while, it sounds a bit monotonous and repeat playability is not very good.
B002MBAJ4M|4.0|Wow- dumbfounded by some of the negative reviews of this new release.    I happen to love the Mule to death, but I did find the last two releases a bit predictable in production and material.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed both High and Mighty and Deja Voodoo very much, but the approach was beginning to sound a tad stale.  I'm not quite sure where the new appeal is derived from, but I simply love this record.    The Mule has always been a band highly influenced by its forefathers, but there is an organic diversity to the new material that really hits the spot.  If you're a Mule fan that longs for the days of the Allen Woody approach, well, those days are over.  This music is more refined, and deeper and richer for it.  Thing is, when they put the pedal to the metal, tracks like \\"Any Open Window\\" and \\"Inside Outside Woman Blues\\" are prime examples of the gut punch these cats are able to land- sure, they have Jimi and Cream as their spiritual ancestors, but what of it?  It's still a sublime listen...    Regardless of the feel of each individual track, I love the fact that Warren seemed to have made a concerted effort to stretch out a bit.  I for one applaud him for it- \\"By a Thread\\" is pretty darn close to being my favorite Mule record yet.
B000E9910W|5.0|Who doesn't like the Doobie Brothers! All of my favorites are on this double CD! 'Listen to the Music' is by far the best song to dance to, unless you have Michael Jackson's best songs, which will be my next purchase. As I said on another review, I love Amazon because I can listen to clips from the the CD's and can pick out the one that suits my ears. I love shopping on Amazon as they have always come through for me on more than music. I highly recommend Amazon to anyone who is interested in making a purchase of any kind. Thank you once again, Amazon!
0882709194|1.0|I think if has-been actor Kirk Cameron and Ray Comfort, whoever this guy is....another person who has read the Bible and has believed every word I suppose, are going to write an introduction to Darwin's \\"Origin of Species\\" then Richard Dawkins should be write an introduction to the King James version of the \\"Holy Bible\\" debunking the existence of God.  At least Dawkin's forward would be full of facts and provable statements unlike the hysterical drivel presented by Cameron and Comfort.  I wonder if Cameron and Comfort would approve of an alternative introduction debunking evolution, but written by an Islamic scholar?  Anyway, I've paged through the intro.   It's like someone walking up to you at a gas station and evangelizing to you.   And just as I do with the evangelists...I dismiss this introduction as the work of people who need to mind their own business.
B000YABIQ6|4.0|It's difficult to find quality storylines in the spirit of The Sopranos and Six Feet Under, but Mad Men is definitely in the same category, without the cursing, sex and violence.  The cast is veritably anonymous, but well-acted, penned brilliantly with characters developing gradually over the course of the season.  Well worth the price.
0441013597|5.0|Frank Herbert's remarkable achievement stands the test of time.  The 40th anniversary edition of his classic scifi novel Dune is still the compelling read that the book has been ever since its creation.  Not easy to get into because of Herbert's short scenes and arcane and esoteric terminology, the story soon gets hold of the reader, even so, and refuses to let go.  Try it, and you'll see.
B000W91RUG|3.0|Very uneven performances. Leonard, who is the 'straight man' of the comedy team impressed me much more than Sheldon as an actor. Sheldon is a caricature of all the nerd-genius--relationship negative characters who ever performed in any media.    Penny is believable and enjoyable.    The later episodes did improve, so I will probably buy future seasons.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I have had this video for 2 years now and I still feel like I am playing it for the first time. I purcahsed 5 copies and gave them out to friends who really enjoy Pink Floyd's era. The lighting and stage effects are great. This is my top 5 video to watch over and over...Tks AD
B002NWRMVS|5.0|And for me the best of her albums yet.  On her past albums, I have liked a few tracks, but quickly tired of either the oldtime Jazz or country tone of her songs.  Many were slow and not very exciting.<br /><br />Norah takes a totally different track on this one.  Almost all of the songs fit the pop genre and are upbeat.  Before this album I thought Norah's best effort was the coloboration with the Peter Malick Band.<br /><br />My favorite tracks are:<br />Chasing Pirates<br />Even Though<br />Light as a Feather<br />Young Blood<br />You've Ruined Me<br />I Wouldn't Need You<br />Waiting<br />It's Gonna Be<br />Stuck<br /><br />Solid album.  Good job Norah!
B00003CXTG|1.0|It's a shame.  Large, talented cast.  Great locations.  Lots of money spent...  on everything but the script.  I remember seeing previews and being really excited to see Pearl Harbor.  Imagine my dissappointment when I saw the movie and learned that the movie was just BARELY about Pearl Harbor.    Pearl Harbor isn't an appropriate title for this movie.  A better title would be, \\"Adolecent minded adults find themselves in a trailer park type love triangle - and WWII!\\"    Additional appropriate tags for this movie:  Crap, Springer, Film Makers You Wish Could Be Killed by Bees...

0812976525|4.0|I read this in about 24 hours (which is fast for me). Nick Naylor is the chief spokesman for the tobacco lobby. His boss wants him out, but after an impressive showing on Oprah, he becomes the darling of the lobby's chairman of the board. He gets kidnapped and tortured by antismoking advocates. Corporate intrigue takes place.    This was a very fun, witty ride. Naylor is sympathetic, and he has a genuine friendship with her fellow Merchants of Death, the chief spokesman for firearms and the spokeswoman for alcohol. The satire of Hollywood, of the lobbying industry, of Washington spin, is all fun. A man next to me at baggage claim said, as I laughed out loud, That must be a great book! You haven't put it down! He was right.    In the last quarter of the book, it starts to get even a little crazy for my generous suspension of disbelief, but I still couldn't stop reading, and the ending is satisfying (even with a several-years-later epilogue;* it's like watching [[ASIN:B000E6ESI0 9 to 5]] with Lily Tomlin all over again).    Note on content: Some language, some sexual content, some violence. Less language or violence (and a little more sex) than [[ASIN:0156028972 Gun, with Occasional Music]] (but not as good as that one either). Less of everything than the White Tiger.    * To include the several-years-late epilogue or not to? I remember finishing the [[ASIN:0143039431 The Grapes of Wrath]] and DYING to know what happened to Joads down the road. Harry Potter has it. 9-to-5 (the film) had it. Thank You For Smoking has it. Lots of movies based on real life have it (Remember the Titans, Stand and Deliver, etc.). Gun, with Occasional Music sort of had it, but in a particularly creative way. I get the feeling that the best books don't do it, but not everyone is aiming to be (or needs to be) the best book...
B00000FCBC|3.0|I just got Garage Inc. on vinyl and the main reason I got it was to have \\"Garage Days Re-Revisited\\" on vinyl. I've had it on cd since its original release in the 80's. I also got it for \\"Breadfan\\" which was the B side of \\"Blackened\\" which I used to have. The other song I bought it for was \\"Stone Cold Crazy\\" that came out on Elektra's 40'th anniversary compilation which was a cover of Queen's song. When I got home, I played the Garage Days side at the normal 33 speed. I turned it up and the intro to \\"Helpless\\" was sounding insane, and then the voice track started and it was at 45 speed. They sounded like the chipmunks went thrash. I was thoroughly confused. Did anyone else get vinyl version and have the same problem, or did I get the only one?
1416562605|2.0|A good friend recommended this strongly, and it won the 2008 Booker Prize, so I gave it a try. The Booker committee said \\"Balram's journey from darkness of village life to the light of entrepreneurial success is utterly amoral, brilliantly irreverent, deeply endearing and altogether unforgettable.\\"  I agree with 1, 2, maybe 4, and 3 if you take off the \\"deeply\\" and even then only reluctantly.    The protagonist - Balram - is some kind of entrepreneur who is writing letters to the premier of China to tell him about the true India. Balram tells of his rise from poor village boy to tea shop worker to ... well, I won't give too much away. But Balram does not allow himself to be bound by traditional norms of morality around, say, killing. And other stuff. The power in the novel is demonstrating how poverty can breed an amorality that is chaotic and frightening. But I only came to find the protagonist sympathetic towards the very end, up until which I merely found him offputting (and scary). I don't think, if I were to turn back time, that I would read it again.    Note on content: I don't remember reading a book with more f-words. There is violence. There is significant sex talk. This is a dark world of crushing poverty and desperation.

As a result, wider administrative requirements are being imposed on solicitors in relation to clients' use of services.<br /><br />The guide also covers and the Law Society's Anti-money Laundering Practice Note of 22 February 2008 - another milestone in the evolution of the law and practice concerning anti-money laundering - from which the author has quoted extensively. Also contained in the appendix to the book is the full text of the Law Society's most recent Anti-money Laundering Practice Note of 22 February 2008 which, (at the time of the book's publication, November 2008), was submitted to the Treasury for approval.<br /><br />In the words of Sir Stephen Lander, Chair, Serious Organised Crime Agency, 'the Money Laundering Regulations 2007 (in force as at December 2007) `incorporate a risk-based approach to customer identification and due diligence and will have a direct impact on solicitors and their dealings with their clients....' `It is no longer possible, says Peter Camp, `to turn a blind eye to a client's potential criminal transaction'.<br /><br />User-friendly, straightforward and accessible, `Solicitors and Money Laundering' illustrates with practical examples some of the complexities encountered within this area of law. Of particular interest is Part 2 of the book with its section on `How to spot money laundering activities in a solicitor's practice'.  This section is directly relevant to those barristers who can now accept public access work and have done the course which strongly features how to deal with money laundering issues.<br /><br />With key texts and legislation included in the appendices, plus useful Table of Cases and Table of Statutes, this is an invaluable work of reference for the well prepared solicitor's library.<br /><br />ISBN: 978-19-85328-753-4and accessible, `Solicitors and Money Laundering' illustrates with practical examples some of the complexities encountered within this area of law.

Professor Lodewijk Van Stetten's work of legal reference will certainly capture your attention from the outset.<br /><br />Certainly from the first few paragraphs of the introduction, Van Stetten's book starts as its means to go on.  Clearly and authoritatively, it defines, clarifies and indeed confirms (for example) what we all know to be a truth that's not universally acknowledged about who's who in the investment food chain -- and that is that 'private households and governmental agencies are the ultimate holders of all assets, (so there!) directly or indirectly, through public institutions, corporate firms or institutional investors'.<br /><br />These principles are further clarified in the author's straightforward, lucid prose which, in all, sets the stage so to speak, for the book's further explication on institutional investment management.<br /><br />This is a legal tome, but for obvious reasons the subject matter must also deal with and /or allude to economic theory. The author, a visiting professor of law at King's College London and Managing Director and International Counsel at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, knows whereof he speaks.<br /><br />So, be you a lawyer, an economist, or yes, an investment manager, or some other sort of financial services guru, this is one legal work of reference you'll especially value -- especially bearing in mind that, in the words of the author, `investment management is a regulated activity'...carried on `within the parameters of the applicable financial services regulatory framework, which is therefore a relevant part of the context within which to determine the scope of the manager's duties.'<br /><br />The book, in just 300 pages and a small index, covers- and this is by no means an exhaustive list -the investment process...the regulatory framework...the legal duties of an institutional investment manager...the exercise of investment discretion...cash accounts and cash transfers...securities accounts and securities transfers...trading and settlement...and of course much more. Terms, nomenclature and processes pertinent to all aspects of investment management (including the investment process itself) are methodically and clearly explained.<br /><br />Even if you think you know it all about investment and investment management, this book will remind you that you don't know it all, especially the legal ramifications -- and if you feel you still have much to learn about this complex area of law, the book will de-mystify much of that mind numbing complexity, proving its worth as an invaluable and authoritative addition to your library explained with great clarity by Professor Van Setten.<br /><br />ISBN: 978-0-19-928501-3ers- and this is by no means an exhaustive list -the investment process...the regulatory framework...the legal duties of an institutional investment manager...the exercise of investment discretion...cash accounts and cash transfers...securities accounts and securities transfers...trading and settlement...and of course much more.

We are very fortunate to have a man with his knowledge and experience sharing it with us.<br /><br />Note that it's 6 years since the last edition of \\"McGregor\\" was published and as the author points out, 'change has been rife in the interim,' alluding to, for example, certain unattractive rules having been abandoned by the House of Lords, while at the same time, `brakes have been applied to expanding areas.'<br /><br />As for what exactly constitutes `damages', it's the author's assertion that arriving at a definition of the term has become more and more difficult as time has moved on and that therefore `the search for a clear cut comprehensive definition is therefore abandoned'.  He does add that there is a definition which applies generally but not invariably and, in case you're curious, it can be expressed as:<br /><br />`Damages in the vast majority of cases are the pecuniary compensation, obtainable by success in an action, for a wrong which is either a tort or a breach of contract, the compensation being in the form of a lump sum awarded at one time, unconditionally and in sterling.'<br /><br />Incorporating and encompassing all the new complexities of an already complex area of law, the new edition of McGregor contains a wealth of new material too extensive to list here, although, in the current political climate, it is irresistible not to mention the new and very topical damages chapter on Invasion of Privacy and Misfeasance in Public Office.<br /><br />This carefully structured and meticulously compiled work of reference is split into 4 book parts with 46 chapters in about 2000 pages - it's big, heavy and authoritative, and states the law as at the beginning of 2009, although reference to case reports appearing afterwards and before final proof stage of cases included in the text have been added, together with other pertinent addenda.  However, if in these competitive times, you need to stay completely up to date to keep on top of your game in an ever changing legal landscape, don't forget those further updates which are produced regularly from Sweet and Maxwell!<br /><br />To end where McGregor begins, his Preface states \\"life for the legal author is not as easy as it used to be\\" (weight of authorities/lengthy judgments).

B000V5TV22|5.0|The receiver worked as published.  After a 'cold' start getting a good fix was immediate to 5 seconds.  I used this with a Samsung netbook for navigation on a recent trip.  I'd use the machine, then hibernate the machine.  An hour or so latter I'd wake up the machine and the GPS would already have satellite lock before the machine would be ready (15 seconds).  The satellite memory would last an hour or two without power.  A 'cold' start took about 30 seconds.  Once about every 5 'cold' starts the receiver would give up and never get a lock.  However once a lock was achieved the receiver worked flawlessly. As long as I gave it power ever hour or two it would keep the lock.
0756405890|5.0|The Name of the Wind has all of the elements of fantasy, and yet still manages to be a book that rises above the rest.  I picked it up at Powell's in Portland Oregon; I was on my way to Cannon Beach to spend my Thanksgiving weekend in front of a crackling fire, and spectacular views.  At the time, it was just another paperback to help me relax through the weekend.  It took awhile for it to sink in.  I think,by about chapter 7, I had begun to realize the true genius of the author.<br /><br />At once it feels like one of those first term Intellectual Heritage classes I had to sit through in college.  And in some ways it is, it approaches the Fantasy Genre with a firm understanding of Myth.  A world has been built with an understanding of Economics, of Culture, of Anthropology.  Yet, unlike previous offerings (Tolkien comes to mind), the pacing is not lost to explain these things.  We find out about the world as it become necessary to understand the story, and as the Characters touch each part, the world begins to be filled in.<br /><br />The characters are the best part of this story.  Each one having a depth and a humanity rarely seen since C.S. Lewis. Kvothe is a multifaceted human being.  He is at once a legend, and despite that a Myth.  His story is masterfully told, and the details of his life, leave us with a deeper connection with him and his struggles.  It is Kvothe's Coming of Age story with all of its trappings, and yet one cannot help but sense there will be something more.  The women are written in a way that I have not seen in Fantasy: Complicated, real, strong, and unknowable; human.  In this one respect, Patrick Rothfuss abandons all of the fantasy genre's traditions.  In all of this, he writes with a prose that is like a finely polished river stone in a cold mountain stream.  It was a pleasure to read this book.<br /><br />I look forward to the sequel, but not in the same way I look forward to most sequels. Of course I want to find out what happens next, but for most books, that is all I care about.  I plan to savior the next book as I did this one.  I read it once; it took a 4 days.  I read it a second time; it took 2 weeks.  I savored it, read to a stopping point and put it down.  I plan to do the same with the next.  I look forward to next book for two reasons: first, I want to find out what happens, and second, I like reading excellently crafted stories told by master stories tellers with magnificent prose.  I am aware that it takes time to do the latter, and so I am willing to wait for as long as it takes.  When it comes out I might not even read it the same day. (as I do with most anticipated squeals)  I might wait for my next trip back to Cannon Beach with my crackling fire and spectacular views to accompany a spectacular book: 5 starsks, that is all I care about.

B0017KIBAI|5.0|I've run through a couple of controllers in my playing time and none have been like this controller. Usually when you buy a new controller it takes a few months to break it in, so it starts playing like you want it to for games like Smash Brothers Melee and other games that require precise timing with the controller, well this controllers comes ready for that without the wait or the preparing, it feels like a dream.  So if you want to play Smash Brothers Melee in an advance manner or any other game for Gamecube or Wii, this is the classic controller to get.
B0000E1WKE|1.0|There's not one single note of joy or warmth or sincerity to be heard on this miserable Christmas record. Whitney's singing is every bit as stagnant as the second rate r&b arrangements that desecrate these once beautiful Christmas standards. Being the greedy songbird that she is, her voice has a tendency to go all over the place, as if her wet finger were stuck in an open light socket. The end result is a crass and tactless product, a pathetic excuse to wring a few bucks out of her hopelessly adoring fans during the holidays. I have One Wish as well; that Whitney never makes another Christmas album. Ever.

0545123267|4.0|I read this book in about 2 or 3 days.    I'm usually not the type to read fantasy; it's just not my favorite genre.  But I thought the cover was beautiful, and I heard great things about the book, so I decided to give it a try.    There are a few flaws in the book that I'm sure the many Amazon reviewers already brought up.  So, I'll be brief.  My main problems with the book was:    1)  at times, the author \\"over wrote.\\"  Stiefvater is a solid writer who has some very nice passages.  But at times, she seemed to try a little too hard when plain old English would have sufficed.  She didn't need to do this.  2)  the issue with the werewolf boy (Sam) staying in the main character's (Grace) bedroom for weeks at a time (basically, living in her house) and the parents not having the slightest inclination that he was there.  This seemed very far-fetched, even for the silly, self-absorbed parents that Stiedvater portrayed Grace's parents to be.  3)  the whole subplot about finding the werewolf cure.  Unbelievable and too easy.    These \\"flaws\\" didn't really distract from my enjoyment of the book and the romance, however.  I loved the fact that Sam had rescued Grace years ago from a wolf attack and that had subsequently watched Grace from afar for years thereafter.  And I loved the tension -- that right when they discover each other (as humans), he is about to turn permanently into a wolf.  That brings natural suspense to the story.  And I cried, which is always the mark of a good book (in my opinion).
B000000OU6|5.0|There are a least 8 or 9 really strong tracks on this album. Well worth the purchase if you like slash or GNR.
B000002MU3|4.0|To be honest this is the album that got me into REM. I always admired their radio output, but never picked up one of their albums. At the store one day years ago I came across \\"Monster\\" on sale, and decided to give it a shot. Never hearing a single song off the album, with the possible exception of \\"Bang and Blame\\", I didn't really have any expectations.    With the opening chord \\"crunch\\" of \\"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\\" I was instantly drawn in, and I listened to it straight through in the first sitting loving every second of this album. The song writing wasn't overly complex or pretentious, just great music.    While I did enjoy \\"Monster\\" VERY much on the first listen, many of the tracks become more interesting on repeated listens. The melodies seemed to come out much more the more I paid attention to what was happeneing on each track. In my experience that's always the sign of a classic album, the one's that grow on you over time.    This isn't REM's finest or most complex album, that title belongs to both \\"Murmur\\" and \\"Automatic for the People\\", however I think that's exactly what's appealing about \\"Monster\\", it's the sound of a band at ease with themselves, having fun, not trying to take over the music world.
B002QYY6A8|5.0|Well, what can I say? This is a beautiful album, great sound, fun, playful, skillful, makes hip hop seem limitless instead limited, and it seems way way ahead of its time and it still sounds good after all these years.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|The best thing on TV.  Hands down my favorite Vampire,TV,or movie series.  Has us sitting at the hedge of our seat, dying for more.  Hate waiting a week for next show.  Jason, what a little hottie, Eric, where in the hell, did he came from,Anna what a Star.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|Best movie of the year... \\"This is not a love story, this is a story about LOVE\\" so true!!<br />We see the man, Tom, being the weak/hopeless romantic/dreamer and the girl ,Summer, the strong/cold/dont want to get attached attitude and they did a fblous job because the story its SO real, its a nice indie film i watched it twice in the movie theather and i want to own it so bad. Its refreshing to see that boys cry too and they fall in love, its not always the woman getting hurt, and in this story Summer its not evil or a whor# like in most movies that either you are bad or good, she is just human, honest, and young! like she says: \\"We are young might as well just have fun while we can\\" *-* i talk like that! and im a girl... so yeah i relate! haha<br />THE SOUNDTRACK wow you have to own it too, i love how they picked these great songs that fit perfectly and makes the film even better, the music plays a major role in the movie, we are exposed to Tom's moods through music.<br />The thing people dont like about the movie its that they jump from one day to the other with no cronological order, but i actually liked that, because you see the ups n downs, makes you focus and pay attention to the relationship how it evolves and changes. LOVE IT LOVE IT! watch it give it a try.
1439138311|4.0|Toibin is a new author to me. His very controlled style and obsessiveness with observing subtle feelings in his main character, the young small-town girl Eilis Lacey, and all the characters he assembles here, were a challenge to accept at first. I wondered why, for instance, I was reading so extensively about Eilis's clothes, her friends, and her makeup. At one point, I admit I almost put the book aside, probably at around p. 100, but the writing kept me interested, as did Eilis's keen mind and authentic emotions. Eilis is uprooted from her economically impoverished home town by the machinations of her mother, her sister, and Father Flood, who has made a place for her far away in Brooklyn. All I can say is that her story pulls together and becomes a radiant romance, and then the book delivers a body blow that made me realize how deeply I had thrown myself into Eilis's life. In the end, Toibin delivers a fine piece of work, well worth reading. You will be pleased, so stick with it.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|This was my late husband's very favorite movie.  My video of   My Fair Lady was lost, and I was so glad to find it now on DVD.  It provides many hours of entertainment and enjoyment.
B002MW50KO|5.0|This is album is great fun. Speaking as someone who, as a rule, doesn't even care for Christmas music, I find myself singing along with every song.<br /><br />To the fools and bellyachers who bought the album without listening to it first on Amazon, I have one question; What did you expect??! Seriously, this is exactly like the other material Dylan has been recording recently, but as Christmas carols.<br /><br />No, this it ain't \\"Bing Crosby's White Christmas\\"... get over it.
B002JIOOB2|5.0|I love watching these DVD's. It makes you feel better about who you are. It would be great to see more of these types of programs on TV.[[ASIN:B002JIOOB2 The L Word: Complete Series Pack]]
B001AIRUP4|5.0|I love this movie, so does my daughter and now my grandkids. Now on Blu-Ray, it is astonishing!
B0011HF6GE|5.0|As others have noted, this is a beautiful record. Haunting, mysterious. Unlike anything else I've heard in the past 5 years. If rainy fall late afternoon/early evening had a soundtrack, this would be it.
B0015519VS|5.0|This is an excellent album.  The songs are great and Usher has matured!  I cannot wait to hear his new album.

0670020478|5.0|This, the second book by Ken Robinson is an inspiring insight into creativity and the world of possibility. Robinson's work should be a core text on the curricula of every teacher training college and all those involved in education. Robinson 's thesis is simple: focus on finding ones 'element' (talent) and from that creativity and well-being will flow. However, even if you are not professionally involved in education this book is an enjoyable read for anyone interested in the development of the whole person rather then just from 'the neck up'. Robinson's other book 'Out of our Minds' is equally brilliant and a must read. However, behind Robinson's humor there is a very serious critique of education and the way it devalues individual talents and rewards those who conform.
B001LRJH0U|5.0|Be warned right now - this movie review is mostly one giant spoiler. Here's the non-spoiler parts right up front. This is a movie that strives to look authentic. The two main characters have known each other for years and have no need for a lot of dialogue - they know each other well, they know each other's habits and their conversations are spare.<br /><br />Many reviewers have missed the whole point of the movie. It was not about two buddies/lawmen bringing peace to a town, although that does happen (mostly) and the gun fights are quick, brutal and ugly. The movie is about what happens when such a partnership is disrupted by a woman. Look at the DVD cover art and you can see it symbolically represented - there is Renee Zellweger standing between Mortensen and Harris.<br /><br />****Spoiler alert****The rest of the review is just full of spoilers******<br /><br />In this case, the woman is a pathetic, despicable thing. The movie comes from a Robert B. Parker book and his books are full of people (mostly women, but not always) that claim to be in love but really they are psychologically needy and act out sexually in strange, disruptive ways.<br /><br />There are four main characters in this story: Marshal Virgil Cole, Deputy Everett Hitch, Bragg (a rancher/hotel owner) and Mrs. French, a pathetic woman that leeches onto powerful men out of some deep seeded need that we never quite have explained. Suffice it to say, Mrs. French is a survivor because she uses sex to endear herself to the most powerful man in her immediate area.<br /><br />Many have misinterpreted (in my opinion, anyway) the \\"big\\" fight scene at the end. Here's my take<br /><br />Hitch kills Bragg, but not to defend the honor of Zelweger character, Mrs. French, because she has none to defend. Instead, it is to restore Cole to his rightful place - top dog. Cole won't do anything about it because he loves Mrs. French. She's the first woman he's ever actually talked to about anything except food, sex or meaningless pleasantries - and he loves her despite her messed up, trampy ways. That is his fatal flaw.<br /><br />Hitch, out of love as Cole's friend, cannot stand to see Cole shamed by Bragg so he defends Cole.  Hitch kills Bragg, but in doing so he is now the top dog, rather than Bragg or Cole. In order for Cole to stay in town with the woman he loves and for that relationship to even exist, Hitch has to leave town. If he stays, Mrs. French will just try to seduce him and the Cole/Mrs. French relationship will end. Also, the Hitch/Cole relationship will end.<br /><br />So, out of friendship, Cole kills Bragg so that Cole has the chance of keeping the woman he loves, even though it ends the Cole/Hitch relationship. Deputy Hitch sacrifices the friendship in order to give his friend a chance at happiness with Mrs. French. Truly, a beautiful moment, although subtly played.espite her messed up, trampy ways.

B002N5N5QQ|5.0|This is the best show on TV. The actors are great and the story line is riviting. I love Ron Perlman and Katey Segal...........Who would have thought she had it in her. I cant wait for season 2 to come out of DVD. The sons may seem like bad guys, and I guess they are to some extent, but I would rather live next door to Clay, Jax and the crew than Tony Soprano.

160094048X|5.0|Like all the books from Isa and Terry (Vegan Brunch, Veganomicon, Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World, and my favorite oldie Vegan with a Vengeance), this one is a winner. I just made a batch of the chocolate agave trailmixers (substituting carob for chocolate) and was very pleased with the result. They are like little brownie cookies with extra fun bits inside.<br /><br />The format of the book is very much like the cupcakes book. It is easy to follow, has loads of great photos, and very handy tips all along the way. A big hit and a top rating from me. Now I've got to have a cookie with some almond milk!
B0010VD7EO|5.0|I must be honest, not the entire album is catchy and alluring, but the few good songs on the album, are definately worth the purchase. Songs like, 'Electric Feel', 'Kids', and 'Time To Pretend', will definately take you back to the psychadelic era. The tracks on the album lack a sense of realism, so if you need to get away from every day life, and shut out the world, this album may just be your dose of medicine!
B000053VAZ|5.0|This is the ultimate \\"feel good\\" movie.  I am on Amazon now buying my 3rd copy of Benny and Joon, since I have worn the past two DVDs thin--you cannot get sick of this movie.  The scene with Sam swinging across the window always makes me smile!  Not many know about this movie, and I wouldn't say its an amazing feat in film making, but it's a great story.  Makes you believe in happy endings.
B00204AA0O|5.0|I must say, when Begin To hope came out in 2006, I was very disappointed at how poppy mainstream it sounded, and there were only a few good songs on the album. Now this one, Far, will blow you away. It has the creative edge of Soviet Kirsch, her first album, with dark, agressive, piano playing. The music itself tells a story, and her quirkiness and pure talent will keep you asking for more. This is one cd you can play over and over in your car and never get tired of.
B002HWRYJE|2.0|This film was interesting only from a historical perspective. It lacks depth and substance, and tries to make up for a lousy plot and shallow characters with flashy, useless special effects that only detract, bore and annoy.<br /><br />SPOILER PLOT. We see how the paths of Kirk, Spock, Uhura, Scotty, Chekov and Sulu intersected, beginning from Kirk's birth. This timeline is different from that of the regular, known Trek universe. A Romulan from the future has traveled back in time to avenge the blowing up the planet Romulus, which apparently the elder Spock promised to avert but wasn't able to. Now Angry Romulan wants to kill major players in Starfleet, as well as blow up Spock's native planet Vulcan, in the hope that Spock will suffer as Mr. Angry did (in the future). Angry does, in fact, manage to kill Kirk's father on a ship; Kirk's about-to-give-birth mother and the rest of the crew escape while Kirk's dad dies defending them.<br /><br />A now adult young Kirk joins Starfleet under unusual circumstances. Kirk and his cohorts prevent Angry Romulan from doing any more damage, thanks to the wisdom of Elder Spock, who shows up in this timeline to advise Kirk and his own younger self. Elder Spock gives Scotty the formula about life-saving technology Scotty will develop in the future -- or DID develop in Elder Spock's future timeline. (You still with me?) In this film, the now new timeline is not repaired. Kirk's father still died defending his pregnant wife and crew, young Spock and Kirk's friendship gets off to a bumpy start, and more. However, at least there will be no more damage from Mr. Angry.<br /><br />CHARACTERIZATION. New Scotty sounds just like the old one (but we don't learn anything about him). Kirk does a pretty good job as a younger version of Shatner. And Spock is decent, if lacking in the essence of what it means to be Vulcan. Uhura is competent and spunky; too bad the original Uhura was never given this many professional credentials and tasks that this younger version was given. (I appreciate the efforts to overcome the sexism of the original, first Star Trek.) However, all this cannot rescue this film. (By the way, what was Uhura doing French kissing Spock -- and Spock kissing her back? It didn't fit in anyplace, and certainly did not follow the original.)<br /><br />DOWNSIDES. This film is more of a novelty and the glimmering of an undeveloped, good idea. It lacks the spiritual dimension, psychological sophistication and developed relationships between the characters of Star Trek's best films and TV episodes. Elder Spock telling younger Spock to \\"follow your feelings\\" doesn't constitute enough of a worthwhile message to redeem this flick, although it's always nice to see Leonard Nimoy. The soundtrack is relentless, noisy and distracting, and overshadows the dialogue at times. The visuals are simply ugly and busy, looking as though too many hand-held cameras are working overtime. I got dizzy watching all this tiring pointless activity, and had my finger poised on the fast-forward button. And due to the excessive and unnecessary action, this film needed a good editing; about 20 to 25 minutes less would have made it much better.<br /><br />CONCLUSION. What I loved most about Star Trek's finest TV and movies were its messages, acting, and character development. This film just didn't do it for me. Die-hard fans may like and even love this flick. But for my taste, the best in Star Trek -- where there are socially redeeming messages, great characters, humor and depth as well as action -- is still Voyager, all seven seasons on TV.iven.

0786868724|4.0|To have spiritual faith you must hold a particular belief.  I believe Jesus Christ is the only way to salvation, i.e. I am a Christian.  The Jewish faith believes in God the Father yet are still waiting for the Christ so they are half way home.  Chistianity believes there is only one way to salvation and that is through Jesus Christ - period.  That said, Jesus was not mean spirited to those who did not believe; in fact, that is why the Father sent Him to us, to reach the unbelievers.  And He always did so with compassion.  We are called to have compassion for one another, to be our brother and sisters keeper.  Mitch Albon's book is contrary to most writings of the day; he calls us to have compassion for one another whether or not that ever leads to salvation.  He leaves the question of how we are to believe to us, just as Jesus did.  Whether we accept Jesus Christ or not is up to each of us individually.  It is my hope and desire for all to come and accept Jesus Christ as their savior.  Until then, I will practice compassion without compromising my faith; not as a way to obtain salvation but as a thank offering for having accepted the free gift of salvation.  Mitch's simple book stimulates one to think as well as remind us we need one another, be willing to practice forgiveness and to love one another through the use of whatever talents we have been blessed with.  It's simple but not always easy; thanks Mitch for sharing.
0385474547|4.0|The book is an easy read, but well written. It reads like a spoken tale which makes it quite unique.<br />Though some may have trouble understanding or sympathizing with the characters, as some of my classmates did, one must realize how much a culture affects its members, and that, were we in the same culture, would likely follow the customs as well.<br />The end IS abrupt, but look closely--you will see why.
B0025KVLVA|5.0|Since Past Masters, in the remastered format, contains both albums, it encapsules a complete musical history of The Beatles.  From Love Me Do to Let it Be, this package give a great sampling of their growth and developement as musicians and songwriters.  Take into account the remastering of these songs into bright, vivid episodes, and this is a must for Beatle fans.  For those who were born too late to be there when it happened, listen carefully to these guys, who were not the greatest technical musicians individually, but together were an unbeatable team.  These were the masters of pop music in the sixties, and the term Past Masters could be used with a dual meaning here and and also refer to them as well as their music.
0370313968|5.0|Book is in great shape, arrived quickly, and I could not be more pleased.  Thank you.
B0025KVLS8|5.0|It's still like yesterday to me;  The Ed Sullivan Show, the news stories, the histerial and the fun of something so exciting.  The music of that time was the earmark of a sociological era the likes of which have never been seen before or since.    That's why the remastering of the historic music is so important.  I was so pleased to hear these recordings presented in a crisp, clean and vivid format.  The importance of preserving these recordings cannot be understated.  This is history.  The Beatles represent the most profound influence on the culture of the second half of the 20th century.   The songs bring back the fun, happiness and innocence of the time and cannot help but bring a smile to your face.  I have purchased most of these remastered issues and have yet to be disappointed.  Percussion is crisper, guitar solos are bolder and the whole presentation is just more life-like.    If you were a child of the sixties, these are required listening.  Take a time trip back to those times when the release of a new Beatle album was worthy of the 6 o'clock news and portable radios ruled.
0399215921|1.0|Poor, the book was 3 inches by 3 inches and this was never indicated on the site. As a teacher I couldn't use it and had to spend more money and buy another one from scholastic books. Not a happy camper!!!
B0019LY5IM|5.0|This show just keeps getting better and better. Season Five was no exception. Every eps. was must see tv from the very beginning learning Ben did move the island to the surprising ending of throwing the bomb down that hatch that may or may not have caused the Incident.     They moved the Island. As the Island moved Sawyer, Juliet, Miles and Daniel flashed all over the place before Locke finally moved it again causing it to stop in the seventies when the Dharma Initiative was alive and running the island, Sawyer, Miles, and Juliet end up joining while waiting for Locke to return to the island. Sawyer and Juliet become a new kick ass couple. Miles contiunes to make us all laugh while dealing with daddy issues his father none other then the doctor we've seen in all the videos. Daniel looses his marbles and then makes us cry when he's sent back in time by his mother Eloise only to be shot by her younger self. Oh yeah Charles Widmore is his father I think we have a winner in the worse parentage ever.    Of the island Jack, Kate, Sayid, Hurley, and Sun deal with re-entering the world post-island still believing everyone else back on the island is in trouble. This gets pushed further along by arrivals of Locke and then Ben urging and maniplating them all to go back to the island. They all end up heading back to island with the help of Eloise. Jack, Kate, Hurley and Sayid end up back in the 70s when the new plane crashes while Sun, Locke, Frank and Ben end up in 2007 after crashing in the same plane.     Ben contiunes to be vie for the best psycho award. After moving the island he's banished from it Ben spends his time preparing for his return. Convincing everyone else to go back, stopping in London to promise Widmore he'd kill Penny in exchange for his own daughter's murder. He talks Locke out of suicide before murdering him and staging it as a suicide. Ah Ben your an overachiever. But once back on the island Ben's forced to \\"face the island\\" for his crimes. Oddly enough Alex's death appears to be the only one the island's concerned about and not mass murder and his millions of other crimes. The smoke monster delievers the answer via Alex to do everything Locke says. Hmm not  not what I was expecting but that was fun to watch. Surprisingly Ben does everything Locke says even kills Jacob when he's ordered too. Oh that wasn't Locke....oops. On the other hand maybe that was the best punishment for Ben. Good job Island    Locke poor Locke he flashes around the island with Sawyer and the gang learning the only way he can fix everything is bring everyone back to the island. Unfortunately, he has to die to do it. Locke tries desperately to convince the Oceanic Six to return to the island with no luck. The is murdered by Ben and returned to the island in a coffin.  Once back on the island Locke is a new man. He has a direction, a purpose, he has fun Ben setting out to see the leader Jacob who no one appears to have ever seen except the never aging Richard. Turns out Jacob does exists unfortunately, Locke is not Locke and has dreamed of killing Jacob for ages.    Jacob- to my surprised actually exists in the last eps he is shown having visited every Oceanic Six and Sawyer at a turning point in their lives. Its hard to tell if he's good or evil. He gets Kate out of shopping lifting at an early age, gives Sawyer the pen to write his letter, and distracts Sayid and Nadia which ends up in Nadia's death. While Kate and Sawyer probably would have grown up the same Nadia probably wouldn't have been in the middle of the road when she was killed however if Ben was right about the man who killed her (which its been so who knows) he might have killed Sayid instead. Hurley was the only one Jacob talked to after the island and Jacob appears to have healed Locke so he may be Good but this is LOST so who knows.      Esau- and Not Locke-Guy who wants Jacob dead or Esau as some of LOST boards have been calling him- Esau wants Jacob dead. Jacob keeps bringingpeople to the island who fight and destroy. Esau insists it will always be the same Jacob insists there's only one ending and keeps bring people. Esau wants to kill Jacob. And he doe. By using Locke and convince Ben to kill Jacob which he does. But Locke's body was found in the box so has Esau been impersonating dead people all this time? Is the smoke monster? What does this all mean?      The second crash-Everyone else who didn't flash to the 70s or run off with Ben are heading to the broken Statue   with a huge box containing the dead Locke to see Richadus or Richard. One of them was visited by Jacob in a hospital. Richard is shocked to see Locke's dead body. Are they the whos coming? That Jacob warned Esau about. Or Jack and the crew coming back from the 70s after Juliet denonated the bomb? Or someone else?    Desmond- Desmond beats up Ben. Desmon beats up Ben. That was awsome and a long time coming. Desmond's also the only one who's the most correct about the island that there all just a pawn in someone else's game. Jacob and Esau? Or just one or other? There wasn't nearly enough Desmond this season.     The Bomb-Did it flash at the end? Or cause the incident? Or did it reset things? That's what I love about this show figuring out what the hell is going on. I so hope Juliet isn't dead.    There's millions of other things that happened on this season that I left out or forgot about. But that's what's amazing about LOST there are millions of questions, theories and things happening in each ep that its impossible to name them all or figure them out. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and trying to figure it out right along with the show. Just when you think you've got it all figured out like there's no Jacob they turn it all around on you. God I love this show. Its so good. I can't wait to see how it all ends next season.     But there is one small down side. Kate- I don't know if its the actress or the storylines for her but she is the weakest link on the show.The charactor sucks the energy right out of the show. The Jack and Kate arc was by far the most boring part of LOST. I can't blame Jack because even he gets better when Kate's not around. She has become by far the most useless charactor. There's no reason for her to be on the show anymore. She does nothing and she adds nothing to the story.
B002VLNB1Q|5.0|I am by no means discounting John's brilliant artistry and mastery of the song-writing craft he has displayed on his previous albums, however, in my opinion, this is his best work to date.  each track tells a poignant story set to illustrious melodies.  he is a lyrical genius, and he raised the stakes yet again with his latest release.  buy this album, you won't be disappointed.
B002QEXN2K|5.0|John Mayer has ditched the Eric Clapton / B.B.King influence of blues-drenched Continuum and presented a new album in the vein of John Lennon and Paul McCartney, (ok, and perhaps more melodious Eric Clapton - there's no denying that Mayer is fast assuming a reputation as the new Clapton). Layer upon layer of accoustic guitar, solid drumbeats and piano are folded into the build of each song - replacing the sparse, slow-burn drum beats and ultra focus on the electric guitar in Continuum.     All 11 tracks have structures that are so comfortable to the ear, you forget what mastery of songwriting Mayer is capable of. An album crafted on 1 issue - love and the ugly aftermath following its demise - it is a perfect break-up album.     In just a week, I have grown deeply attached to this album. It just seems to flow so well. My favs are:  - \\"Who Says\\", contrary to what the general consensus is, I find this to be an intelligent first single. It is a breath of fresh air, with its simplicity in instrumental arrangement and lyrics  - \\"Heartbreak Warfare\\"  - \\"All We Ever Do Is Say Goodbye\\" for its chord progression and the \\"I heard it before\\" chorus which abruptly changes into something fresh and new  - \\"Perfectly Lonely\\" is probably one of the catchiest song Mayer has ever written  - \\"Crossroads\\" is a red hot track and it was a pleasant surprise when I first heard it. It has got so much umphh that I thought for a while it seemed to be channelling the late Ray Charles on keyboard!     Awesome, awesome, awesome.
0756405890|5.0|Name of the Wind transcends the Fantasy genre even as it redefines it.  Patrick Rothfuss and George RR Martin are the premiere Fantasy authors of our time.  That this is Rothfusses first novel only makes it more remarkable.
B002NWRMVS|5.0|I'm still giddy from the swirling synths, hypnotising beats and THAT velvety, smokey voice. I think this may be her best album yet since the ubiquitous \\"Come Away With Me\\".    \\"The Fall\\" is a very strong album conceptually, but due to its lack of memorable/catchy hooks, first or second listens seem to just wash over you. On my later listens, I really got into the groove and for once, the woman known as Norah Jones seems to have really surfaced.     Besides light-hearted, feet-tapping \\"Chasing Pirates\\", stand-out tracks that really do it for me are:  - \\"Even Though\\" (written by Jones and Jesse Harris - the writer of \\"Don't Know Why\\") for its delicious electric guitar licks, which are at once psychedelic and soothing  - \\"Waiting\\"; a haunting track that would live up to Bob Dylan or Johnny Cash in 'dreamy' mode  - \\"It's Gonna Be\\" charges forward with a pounding beat and atmospheric voice that Jack White would be proud of  - \\"December\\" is a lovely, sickly, sweet ballad that brings back the crisp, tingly piano playing  - \\"Man Of The Hour\\" sports some witty and humorous lyrics to the piano only trademark album closers.  By the way, her brush with \\"My Blueberry Nights\\" seems to have rubbed off on her. \\"I Wouldn't Need You\\" sounds inspired by \\"The Greatest\\" by Cat Power.    This CD is close to perfection. The 45 minutes or so stay with you long after song #13 ends and my finger itches to push play again. It is Norah Jones revitalised, reinvented and restored to the pop/jazz bliss she is so well known for. Bravo.
B001AVCFK6|2.0|Apparently my taste runs a bit different from others here, but I was looking forward to a prequel to the original series, not a parallel universe in which Vulcan is destroyed, the victim of an instantaneous black hole. What's worse, how can \\"red matter\\" possibly create such a singularity when mass is required.<br /><br />I understand the issues involved in time travel, but J.J. Abrams should have left a way for Vulcan to be restored; otherwise it's not really a prequel at all, for it throws the entire time line off. Also missing is Gary Mitchell, Kirk's best friend.<br /><br />It does little good to make such a movie if one is not entirely familiar with the story and characters. I also found the hard rock music to be noisy and distracting. Part of the brilliance of STAR WARS was the beauty and soul reflected in the music.<br /><br />Perhaps in the next movie, things can be made right. As it is, the movie did not end on a satisfying note to me. Given the new timeline, there's a thousand different ways for Kirk (or Spock0 to die. We'll also have to forget the entire series, because the stories never happened in the new universe.<br /><br />In my view, it would have been better to have entirely new characters and place them in an entirely new time. Of course, if both Vulcan and Nero reappear in another time and place, it might make for another story, but that, too, would be vastly unsatisfying. Face it, gang, they dropped the ball this time. Despite this, the cast, writing and acting were fine. The story sucks.

B001OQCV24|3.0|All great stories need to be retold again and again. The one of the big rain and the ark and the family of the righteous and the saved species and the end of the rain and the ark on the mountain is one of the greatest of all times. That's why it exists in so many different cultures and creeds, with variations. (So I am told, I wouldn't be able to verify it.)<br /><br />So here, the rain is turned into a melting and boiling earth core, causing earthquakes and volcano eruptions and super tsunamis and shifts of continental crusts, all traced back to unusual sun activity and misbehaviour of naughty neutrinos. All in December 2012. Beware!<br />Noah's part, in the voluntary absence of Obama's aged impersonation Danny Glover, is taken by a guy whose name sounds like Budweiser. The rules of the game have changed. Boarding passes for the ark(s) are not allocated on family basis, but cost a cool 1 Bio Euro per head.<br />There is a lot of desperate racing to the ark(s) going on. Cinematoscopic freedom is much enhanced by the shift of the continents. That absolves the script from plausibility restrictions.<br />Mount Ararat, the alleged resting place of Noah's ark, is here replaced by another mountain, but I want to avoid spoilers.<br /><br />My conclusion: big screen action, unsuitable for DVD, can provide satisfactory visual pleasure without engaging the mind unduly.<br />Maybe Noah's story deserves more consistent re-telling?<br />I thought of listing some of the more glaring idiocies of the script, but it is futile. Too long.<br />For sure, Messrs. Cusack and Harrelson will not often have the chance to play stupider parts than theirs here.
0316010669|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell's Blink is about how unconscious thought, maybe can referred as instinct, affects human behavior and decision making.      For example, professionals do what they do without thinking because they have conditioned themselves on the basics so much so that they no longer have to think about it - they just do it.  It is like chewing gum and walking at the same time.  Two of those things are so basic that most people can do it without thinking about it and moreover while thinking about something else.  It is these unthinking thoughts is what Blink describes.      Blink also describes about gut feelings.  Gut feelings compel people to do or not to do things.  Because of the nature of gut feelings, people cannot really describe why they have them.  Blink discusses these undescribable gut feelings and how they help us and harm us.    Also, Blink talks about situations of TMI (Too Much Information) and how sometimes people who rely on gut and experience can survive and outsmart those who are armed with TMI.  I thought the part about TMI was pretty good.  Sort of makes me wonder if people who try to integrate TMI really know what they are doing.    I have read Outliers, The Tipping Point, and What the Dog Saw.  To me, the story about panic and choking from the What The Dog Saw was an extension from Blink.  Blink ranks about 2nd best from his books, Outliers being the best.  From reading this book, it sort of makes me wonder how how he thinks and how he notices common subtleties of human life.  Blink was a different book - it relates more to thought than behavior or effort.    Blink was a good book.  I was left still thinking about the unconscious thoughts that Blink describes.
B002NVLXBO|5.0|First, you need to know that these two CDs do not represent new recordings. The Goldberg Variations were recorded in 1991 and the Bach Concerti in 1993. They have been reissued singly several times since then and have almost universally received glowing reviews. Now the two CDs are packaged together along with a booklet containing essays about each by Dennis Collins (Goldbergs) and by Gilles Cantagrel (Concerti). Pierre Hantaï is, of course, one of the finest harpsichordist around these days and the instrument he plays (a 1985 copy by Bruce Kennedy of an instrument made in 1702-04 by Michael Mietke) is one of the best-sounding (and best-recorded) I've ever heard.<br /><br />The Goldberg Variations performance is one of the most thrilling I've ever heard. One senses that Hantaï takes real risks with his performance and wins every gamble. The forward journey to the repeat of the Aria is inexorable and yet there is no sense of rushing, although there are some pretty fast tempi along the way. Playing throughout is full of verve, technical brilliance and, when appropriate, playfulness. Moreover, Bach dances, as he should. My only quibble is that there are perhaps fewer ornaments in the repeats than one might wish.<br /><br />The concerti included here are BWV 1052 (the famous one in D Minor) and 1054 (the transcription of the E Major violin concerto) for harpsichord and strings, Triple Concerto BWV 1044 for flute, violin, harpsichord and strings, and for contrast between the three concerti there are performances of two preludes and fugues from the Well-Tempered Clavier (WTC II, No. 23 in B Major, and WTC II, No. 11 in F Major). Hantaï  conducts Le Concert Français in the concerti.<br /><br />Audio in both discs is a paragon of clean, lifelike sound.<br /><br />Strongly recommended, particularly at the set's budget price.<br /><br />Scott Morrison
B001KVZ6FW|3.0|For whatever reason, Disney once again resorts to gun violence to keep older kids entertained.  There are also frightening scenarios involving dogs.  Certainly, there are moments of laughter, and the serious subjects of aging, life and death are handled with sensitivity and respect.  However, I urge caution before allowing children under ages five to six to watch the film.  This story is marketed by Disney as a fun-filled family romp.  The ads conveniently leave out the violence!

B0000067L3|5.0|I first bought Wheels of Fire when I was a teenager (in vinyl,of course, 8 track tape was available, and than cassette tapes became available).  I'm guessing that it was first released in 1968.  I played it so often I wore it out, so I had to buy a second copy.  Wheels of Fire has a nice collection of music, Crossroads is full of hot guitar runs, and this song is still played on the radio today 40 years later.  Classic.  Crank it up. The other live tracks, Spoonful, Traintime and Toad, give all three members of the group (Jack Bruce, Ginger Baker, and Eric Clapton) a chance to show off. White Room is perhaps the most frequently played, but I think it is one of the lesser songs on the album, I prefer Sitting On Top Of The World, Politician, Born Under A Bad Sign.  If you like classic rock, Wheels Of Fire is a timeless piece of history.  Jeff Winholt
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|The book started off and read through as what I expected from Brown's two most recent novels, but the ending... such a cop out.  I wouldn't recommend it as it was not worth the effort when all is said and done.  Brown rode on the coat tails of his earlier work.   I felt tricked and played.

B002BE7JEI|3.0|Misery is an engaging story but drags during the middle of the movie.  Kathy Bates is excellent and James Caan is credible as the helpless victim.  There are some twists and turns that keep the plot interesting enough but it is rather dry in the scenes where Kathy Bates is absent.
B000002KLZ|4.0|As a joke, I heard it said that everyone who moved to the suburbs received a copy of Fleetwood Mac's \\"Rumors\\". While it's generally accepted that they were a country-rock/soft rock outfit, this live document proves that they could rock raw and hard. This is Fleetwood Mac at their very loudest. The production is raw and surprisingly unpolished, but the music is furious. It's proven again that Mick Fleetwood and John McVie are the best rhythm section going. Stevie Nick's sex-kitten vocal purrings reveal real power. Not to be outdone, Lyndsey Buckingham's guitar soars to heights never heard before. About the only thing that would have made this package perfect would have been the additions of \\"The Chain\\", \\"Sisters of the Moon\\", and \\"Gold Dust Woman\\".
B000NQPZCY|4.0|Kevin Costner has had at least one great movie, Dances with Wolves, some real stinkers, and some in between.  Nevertheless I like him as an actor.  Revenge has some very good parts and some mediocre parts but all-in-all this is a decent movie.
B002361MLA|1.0|Pass on this book.  I started out reading it - thinking this guy had something to offer us all.  Instead, the farther I got into the book, I discovered that Tolle has translated the parables of Jesus to fit his particular reality.  This is absurd.  How can ANYONE profess to know what Jesus \\"actually\\" meant by his parables.  How did Tolle obtain this divine enlightenment?  Again, it is absurd.  In essence, Tolle is offering HIMSELF as a prophet.  The fact that he's making millions of dollars from this book is a joke on us.  He certainly is profiting on his ability to twist the bible to fit his greed.  It is slanted toward Christians.  Avoid this nonsense and just Live in the present and don't dwell on the past.  It doesn't take a book to show you how to do this.  Maybe a paragraph or a poem would suffice.
B0011MPZM4|5.0|This book has been loved by my mother, myself, and all 3 of my children... the oldest is 22, and the youngest is 5.      An endearing story that begins with a young  mother and her precious (if precocious) baby son.  Through the many stages of his life, though he exasperates her during the day, each night after this boy falls asleep, his mother crawls quietly into his room, pulls him onto her lap, and softly sings a lullaby:    \\"I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you'll be\\".    The book is so funny, because it is so honest!  Most parents can relate to this mother's trials in raising a child, like entire rolls of toilet paper unrolled, muddy footprints, and watches flushed down the toilet!  The teen years are right on the mark (dresses funny, listens to strange music, has strange friends), but through it all the mother's love is apparent.  My children understood the powerful message right away: mom loves him. Even if he messes up. Forever. No matter what.  I can certainly see myself in the mother aging through the pages, and my children: sometimes frustrating, but always loved.    As the story of these two winds down to a bittersweet end, it is a family joke that neither my mom or I can read it aloud without crying at the end.  My kids understood the message: Though the ones we love the most age and change and ultimately leave us, loved ones are a gift to be treasured.
1604590483|5.0|This is an amazing book - full of wisdom.  You will learn tools to use in everyday life.  I highly recommend that you read this.  You will not regret it.  It's somewhat similar to \\"Creative Visualization\\" but richer in a way.

B002QH2NUA|5.0|First off, I think McCartney is one of the few living legands that will ever have the status of being a true honest to God rock star. Yes we have others. But, this guy just loves putting on a show. And this CD&DVD does just that. I had the pleasure of seeing him at Coachella this year and let me tell you, it was electric. Human beings of all ages were there, I mean all! But back to the review. I bought mine at Best Buy to get the extra disk. I just watched the concert disk and it was wonderful. All the gusto and power of the Coachella show and more. The sound is great the picture crisp and clear. It is nice the way he arranges the song order to move the crowd to many great moods. And the price is a big two thumbs up. The BB copy listed at 24.95 was really 19.95 at the reg! Would have liked more of the last part of Abby Road before The End here but. All in all this is a great pleasure to own. I have the Get back DVD and love it also, but this is an amazing concert.If you love the Beatles and of course Macca Just get it. You will have a great evening of song and sight. Almost an adventure. As the Live and let die portion explodes into. You know, I Saw Pink Floyd during there last tour at the old Cleveland stadium and could not wait for Pulse to be released on DVD so I could watch it over and over and remember that awsome night. Well Mr. McCartney has done the same with this as it is just about the same set list as Coachella. What a night to remember! My advise to you the consumer. BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!

1573228737|5.0|Margaret Prior is a very proper young Englishwoman.  She is a Lady Visitor at Millbank prison; meant to show the wayward ladies how to behave themselves in an upright, appropriate fashion.  One prisoner intrigues her more than the others, and this is where our story takes flight.<br /><br />Sarah Waters has a masterful grasp of Victorian London - the deadly smog, the dismal prison system, and the severely limited opportunities for women.  The world of spiritualists and their craft is also explored in some detail.  Waters writes in a style that pulled me in and refused to let me go until the final page was turned, at which point the story still wouldn't release me.  I've spent a great deal of time since finishing the book, thinking about its twists and turns and how I might have reacted to some of the situations in which Miss Prior found herself.  I was thoroughly surprised by the ending (a rare feat nowadays) and I cared a great deal about the main characters.<br /><br />If this is an indication of Sarah Waters' writing style, I'm very excited to read her other novels.  An author with this sort of gift for storytelling comes along but rarely, and should be celebrated.
B002QEXN2K|5.0|Once again Mayer hits all octaves in a bluesy, jazzy, poppy kind of way!  His unique voice and sophisticated guitar riffs with the nice drum beats make this CD another great piece to add to you collection. If you are a true Mayer fan, it is a no brainer.  His music keeps you upbeat and happy.  The lyrics can be a bit simplistic at times, yet at others deeper meanings can be found.  While I like the reflection on \\"Crossroads\\" it just cannot seem to capture the essence of the original.  Bottom line... you will not be disappointed in this new release. It is worth the add to your collection of music and will certainly be one you can pull out again and again!

It does in fact contain bits of good content, here and there.  But still:    **  Two hundred and seventy five -- repeat, 275! -- pages?     **  With all the text in fine print and faintly colored ink?    ** Probably 500+ figures and illustrations, many of them either excessively detailed or of dubious or unexplained relevance, and with captions in even smaller type size?

She practically dies and they don't seem to care.  To leave an 11yr old in the car; come on!  For an 11yr old to be trapped in a perfectly fine car; really!  To have a boy living in their daughters bed for weeks and weeks and have NO clue.  The clue in to Grace's sickness; I hadn't thought that way until they lead me to think it.  Sam mentioned M&uuml;nchausen syndrome and I was thinking Stockholm syndrome.  I then felt disturbed about Grace and Sam and always had that in the back of my mind through the rest of the book.  Sweet; thanks!<br />The first time Grace touches \\"her\\" wolf's ruff as a teenager.  It was cool, but knowing the feelings of Grace and Sam; I found it a little disturbing.

B001QWBM62|5.0|I have had this recorder for about six months and have used it in a number of environments -- recording crowd noises on Washington DC streets, recording background noise in a number of live situations, and as a primary, 4 track recorder to record live stage presentations.  It is well built, nicely compact, and has a wealth of feature to make it a real professional tool, including built-in limiting and phantom power for external mikes.  A real bargain for the price!  Since I don't deal in MP3's I haven't used this feature, but it's ability to capture 48K wav files makes it a perfect match for my Video work.

B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Britneys reign of pop continues, and it has never been more alluring. this album is dark and tragic, yet optimistic.  anyone with even a slight awareness of pop culture knows that britney was not involved in the creative process for this album. this was a difficult point in her life, as it seemed career wise she had lost focus. There was no discipline or desire to hold onto her crown as the princess of pop, yet she defied all expectations with blackout. When she was totally counted out...she came back with this. And silenced her critics and destroyed her competitors.       This album is a full on embrace of the kinky schoolgirl sleaze that was only hinted at in the past. if britney was simply giving you a peek in her first few albums, she lets it all hang out on blackout. She still has that star quality, but it has never been more effective than on these tracks. the music is cutting edge electronica/dance. The producers earned every cent paid to them by britneys management.       lesson to the miley cyrus's of the world: if you are going to be a true pop diva, at least make the music good. miley has yet to realize this but britney nails it on every track. And if I may speak regarding lady gaga...lets call a spade a spade. at least britney has the courage on this album not to hide behind a facade of pseudo intellectual artistic irony in order to get attention. She is willing to just dance for the sake of it, and won't resort to pulling a madonna and pretending it is something more meaningful than it actually is. Britney just does not give a damn and wants to get krunk. Other singers rely on gimmicks and Miss Spears is the real thing and she is still standing, drinks in hand!      You thought she'd be gone after her first album. A flash in the pop pan. She can't sing. She does not write her own material. But she works hard for that money...listen to this album and you will see that Britney has fought for and earned her crown. And it is still hers, with out a doubt. Work it. Miley is probably a little scared, as am I. But I think I like it.
B001493FK8|4.0|I am a person who enjoys Russian authors and Robert Jordan, but the only gripe I have about this book is that is much too slowly paced. Other than that, the characters are very three dimensional with a great deal of background story (probably also why the story is so long winded). It was a great introduction to the series. After I read this book, I couldn't wait to get to book 2. Sadly, the rest of the series is nowhere near as good as the first book.<br /><br />Enjoyable read, but still second to the Wheel of Time for me.
B001PPLIEG|1.0|Sadly, since Daniel Craig came onto the scene I've felt increasingly alienated from the franchise. Undoubtedly Craig is a fine actor, but then again so is Al Pacino, Tom Hanks and Michael Sheen, but I'd imagine they've never been serious contenders for the role of 007! Really if Craig were to appear in a Bond flick, he'd be best suited to either the Robert Shaw 'Red Grant' character in From Russia With Love, or that of 006 in Goldeneye - in other words, playing a villian. To have him playing the great man himself is frankly laughable. Aside from my disapproval of Craig as Bond, I can appreciate the merits of 'Casino Royale', I cannot, however, see any such merits in this offering. Anyway, moving on, there's very little in this film to affiliate it with its predecessors, QOS is simply an action movie and not a very good one at that. If we're to have countless set pieces with very little story in-between, at least make the action watchable. The camera filming the proceedings may as well have been placed in a cement mixer - don't get me wrong, from what I could make out, it looked pretty decent fair - although we'll never know because director, Marc Forster, insists on adopting this increasingly annoying practice of shaky camera work coupled with rapid edits - all in a vain effort to make the viewer feel part of the action. For the record, this style of film making is woeful and the sooner this trends dies away the better - incidentally, Forster's previous films weren't action driven and boy does this show! So, a Bond movie without any opening gun barrel, no Q; no gadgets, no moneypenny, minimal use of the Bond theme, an actor who doesn't resemble the pre-conceived image the majority of the audience has of 007 and no utterance of the immortal line \\"Bond, James Bond\\" - I'm all for a change of direction in the series, the last two Pierce Brosnan efforts were tired and clichéd. However, instead of working within the world of 007, the producers seem to have thrown in thetowel and opted simply to make action movies with a character called James Bond - all this instead of making actual James Bond movies. This is a fundamental mistake and only goes to affirm the notion that, where once 007 dictated the action movie genre, now it simply follows the rest. Oh as for the actual DVD itself, this is nothing spectacular either....
B001LJWKKC|2.0|I love Jason Mraz; I preordered this CD because I loved \\"I'm Yours.\\" Sadly, the rest of the CD is not very memorable. If I were to go back again, I would only buy \\"I'm Yours.\\" His duet with Colby Callait is not all that great; he's done better on Mr. A-Z.<br /><br />Didn't go see him live in concert after the disappointment of this CD.
0893860220|5.0|------------------<br />Inserted on 12/27/2013:<br /><br />I recently had the privilege of chatting on an Internet forum with David Godman (author of [[ASIN:0140190627 Be as You Are: The Teachings of Sri Ramana Maharshi (Compass)]]). David has been living in India for a number of years and also spent time with Nisargadatta Maharaj in the 80's. He confirmed, what I had always suspected, that this book is not really a literal word-for-word English translation of Nisargadatta's talks in Marathi , but a book written by a person who was a realized sage in his own right - Maurice Frydman. In this book - Frydman has used his own realization of Advaita and gift with the English language - to extensively paraphrase Nisargadatta's answers to his visitors in the most eloquent way possible for spiritual aspirants.<br /><br />Frydman's notes of J Krishnamurti's seemingly abstruse \\"teachings\\" were also considered to be similarly clear in expression.<br /><br />------------------<br /><br />What can be said about \\"I AM THAT\\" that has not been said already ?<br /><br />As an Indian, I am a bit embarrassed that Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj is not a household name in India. In fact, I had not heard of him myself until I moved to the United States.<br /><br />The clarity and consistency in Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj's thoughts is astonishing and so is the articulate manner he presents his ideas (esp given the fact that he wasn't even formally educated).<br /><br />That said,  I think a good deal of credit for this book should also go to the translator - MAURICE FRYDMAN . To translate tape-recorded spiritual discourses, that is so deep and often difficult-to-understand, could not have been an easy task. And from what I know of Indian languages - there are many nuances that are difficult to accurately express in English. This makes me wonder how the original Marathi version of this book reads like.<br /><br />I AM THAT is a reference manual that should sit by your bed side ready to be referred when you seek answers to life's complex questions. This is not a book that is read from cover to cover. Open a random page and be prepared to be overwhelmed with the wisdom packed in what you read. As other reviewers have pointed out, Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj does not hold back anything. He makes no pretense towards politeness or any kind of \\"tenderness\\" that often characterize spiritual teachers. He is out to state facts and facts alone.<br /><br />A quote randomly plucked from the book :<br />\\"You mind the war next door, but you hardly give it a thought when it is in some far off country. The shifting fortunes of your ego determine your values.\\"<br /><br />I AM THAT is the last post of your spiritual seeking. Your search is over. Let this book be your Bible, Koran and Bhagavad Gita. And that is not a comment I am making lightly.
0812580346|3.0|Sawyer is a good author of science/technical fiction. This story is pretty interesting but his other book, Terminal Experiment, is much more so. By the way - even though the TV series by the same name is based on this book, the story lines are quite a bit different.

B000SO7OMA|5.0|I must first say this is the first concert CD I have ever purchased and I am so glad I did. It is amazingly spectacular!!! I have seen Loreena McKennitt in concert in Atlanta once and I do have her other music CDs but to see her in this haunting setting is a real treat! I love watching the muscians playing. They all seem so happy and enjoy making their music. My favorite is the oriental guy on the key board. I fell in love with him at the concert I attended. He dances with the music the whole concert and he enjoys the music so much, observers can't help but enjoy it too. I hate going to concerts where the musicians never smile, look so serious like they are in pain and they can't wait to get finished. It makes me feel like I can't wait until they get finished too but not Loreena Mckennitt and her band. The vibes are contagious and before you know it, you are moving in your seat too! I recommend this video highly.
B002CAWNEM|1.0|really, really, stupid story, bad acting, totally unbelievable story. can't believe they dare to bring this out. it's actually a joke. they try to be serious, but really, it's ridiculous, everything, the dialogues. this is a joke and a total waste of money.

1416550534|4.0|The House at Riverton is an engaging period mystery narrated by elderly Grace, who in her youth was a servant at Riverton. Grace has spent the remainder of her interesting and varied life trying to forget her ties to Riverton, but as the end of her life approaches she feels compelled to tell the true story of the disintegration of the Hartford family culminating in the suicide of a troubled young poet who was entangled with the daughters of the house.<br />This is a quietly narrated piece; it takes a bit of time for the reader to be drawn in, but once engrossed this is hard to put down. Some reviewers have noted the heavy foreshadowing, and at times the plot revelations were no surprise. However, the final revelation was unexpected, at least by this reader.<br />Kate Morton has created a novel that embodies the moody, restless spirit of the period between the two World Wars in England. The upper classes struggle with the disintegration of the class structure they have built their familial estates upon, the working class and women struggle with the new freedoms just becoming possible, and everyone is weighed down by the grief of the recent war.

B00006ADD5|1.0|first saw \\"Lawrence\\" when I was a boy growing up in the 1960's. I assumed it was, more or less, a truthful account of a man's life. Nothing could be farther from the truth. It is a beautiful movie, but it has very little to do with T. E. Lawrence. The screen writers had their own political agendas and basically invented most of the scenes in the movie. I mean they made major errors and omissions in the film, didn't even get the geography correct. From a historical point of view, piece of junk. Check out this link from the T. E...<br /><br />The problem is that people will remember the fiction of the movie and not really see the reality of the man. This is a pity.<br /><br />[...]
B0026OE2NY|5.0|The most stunning information I've received in an entire life of \\"book\\" learning.      Absolutely run to rent this.  Should be required viewing by every human in every country in the world.  Or at least by those of us that are making the most negative impact to the world.    Stunning is the only word that really describes it.    \\"Home\\" is about how our world works as far as consumption and demand, and how our demands are affecting the world.  I had no idea how big cattle production was, and the cost to the planet associated with it.    Gorgeous, stunning photography also...

B000PC1N54|3.0|This is a decent Aida. Alagna sings Radames better than I thought he would. I thought his voice would be too light for the role. Urmana is also better than I expected, because previously I thought she was squally when I saw her sing the La Forza Leonora and the HD Aida from the Met recently. So she was in much better form than I have seen her in.<br /><br />I normally like Zeffirelli's set designs, but what is this obsession with golden rods strung horizontally throughout this production? What are they supposed to signify?<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers about this video though. The video/tv director spends way too much time focusing on pieces of fabric and details of the sets while the singers are singing. It starts out being a very small annoyance, but by the Tomb Scene you are so sick of seeing a piece of fabric while the singers are singing and then it suddenly gets ten times worse during this Tomb Scene. It is like the video director did not want you to even see the Tomb Scene at all. It is incredibly annoying! Whoever made the decision to continually cut to fabric and inanimate objects throughout the video is an idiot. The Tomb Scene is one of the most beautiful moments in all of opera and it was spoiled.

1427206031|5.0|This review is of the unabridged CD of the book.  The reader made this come totally to life for me as I was riding to and from work. I'd end up so engrossed in the story that after 45 minutes on the road I'd have to continue listening even after I reached my building's parking structure.    The story line is well written and you feel that you really understand the protagonist's motivations, but this is one of those books that I'm certain wouldn't work for me unless it was read by someone who could bring the time and the language to life.    Bottom line: wonderful to listen to.
0307454541|4.0|I was fascinated by this book, and can't really explain exactly why. I think I was a little bit enamored with the way Stieg Larsson developed the main characters, and I loved that he created a smart, wily woman with a unique skill set and intuitiveness. As a journalist, I loved the plot line centering around what happens when you dig up a great story that goes bad, and as someone who still secretly wants to be a detective, I loved the way the main character went about solving a decades-old mystery. It was just a great book, and I can't wait to read the next 2 books (and the 3rd if it's ever allowed to be finished and published) that Stieg Larsson wrote before his own mysterious early death.
B0029O08WA|5.0|It really surprised me how much did I liked the soundtrack.  At first, I loved the first one, but I got tired of the songs really quick, but this time I can't stop listening to it. I really love it, and when I watched the film last Wednesday, I thought that every single song was perfectly combined with the film.  I hope I'll like the third one as much as this soundtrack.  I hope the music director keeps going like this.
B000ZECQ08|3.0|I love the Harry Potter series and Half-Blood Prince is one of the best books in the series. To be honest i enjoyed the movie except for the beginning and the ending. I didn't care for the fact that Dumbledore had met Harry at the train station. I was really excited to read in the book that Dumbledore had gone to the Dursley's and took Harry out of there. I was also disappointed when they didn't have Dumbledore's funeral. They pretty much just let him lay dead on the pavement. I thought the cave was exciting and i was really happy that it turned out the way it did in my head when i read the book. I thought it was a bit dark and different for the Harry Potter series. I liked that the writters incorporated the fact that Tonks and Lupin were in a relationship. I thought that it could have had a better ending. All in all i like H-BP and anyone who is a big fan of the books would probably like me and be alittle dissapointed!
0521682010|5.0|This book is an excellent resource for TEFL teachers to teach Medical English in a medical setting.  Chapters are short and to the point.  Teacher can select topics most related to the population being taught.  Very good appendix.
B002OB9KPE|4.0|This is a disc that will climb inside and take root, if you let it. After several listens, I have found this to be a masterpiece of cohesion and instrumentation. I am of course referring to the first disc/song. The second disc is throw-aways and covers, thus the deduction of 1 star. The Genesis cover, however, is amazing!     The Whirlwind is fantastic, but so much is going on, you can be overwhelmed upon first listen. Like anything worthwhile, this will take a while before you can savor all of the fine pieces that add together to make a brilliant sum of it all. I can now, after repeated listening, finally understand the finale that I used to think was far too religious. I now appreciate it for what it is, the best way to conclude the journey that this song takes us on.     Inspired and magnificent, this is prog as it should be.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|I stumbled upon this series a few months ago and it was like discovering Star Trek the first time.  Did they make this series just for me?  It has plenty to offer everyone from some great one liners and physical comedy to chilling stories that make you remember what a good old horror movie was about.      The Winchester boys, Dean (Jensen Ackles) the elder and Sam (Jared Padalecki) the younger have seen their relationship evolve and besides one lapse on the writers side to make Sam do something a lot of people what \\"what the hell was he thinking\\" I think they jabbed and joked around like only brothers could.  The funniest thing is that Sam is the responsible one, and Dean who pretty much raised Sam as their father was absent has regressed into a pretty fun hedonistic character.  And yet he is the one that gets allied with the Angels while Sam, the one who prayed and tried so hard to do right was the one slipping in with the demons.      Although each episode does stand on its own most time, if you really want to enjoy the series start at the beginning.  If you are into this type of action adventure (horrors-que) with great brotherly interactions this is  show for you.

0439023483|5.0|I just finished Hunger games minutes ago and I feel like I have just been let in to a secret club.  Seriously.  I have read reviews on Hunger Games for months now and wondering what all the hype was.  I entered a few contests to win it, and did not.  I did however win a copy of Catching Fire and I knew I had to read Hunger Games first so I bought it last weekend and started it yesterday.<br /><br />This is a book that by cover alone I would never have picked up.  The title?  Nope.  Reading what it was about?  Still a no, I couldn't imagine myself reading on a topic of young kids fighting to the death.  Even after I picked the book up and opened up to the first page I still am having doubt.  What if I am that one person that just cant get into this book?  And then I started reading....  and in no time, I loves Katniss and her strength and her love for her family.  I love Prim in all her youthfulness and sweetness... still mostly untouched by all the harshness of all this world that I have just entered.  I could hardly put it down.  You know the type.  The book that you can hardly stop to eat dinner for.  It traveled with me everywhere the past 48 hours.  In any spare moments I had, I read.<br /><br />I don't know what I can say other than I loved this book!  It is so well written that I have a list of people who I feel must read it.  I have to tell my book club about it.  I am not sure who to pass this book on to next because the selfish book lover in me is thinking, what if they damage it?  What if I dont get it back?  I seriously am treating this book like a piece of gold I just discovered.... a book of much worth.<br /><br />What am I reading next?  As I type, I have Catching Fire sitting next to me.  It has to be next.  I have to know what happens next.
0375703764|5.0|If you don't have much patience, this book is not for you.<br /><br />If, on the other hand, you enjoy browsing and reading some books several times--particularly books like this, where at least a couple of readings are required, since there's so much to discover--then this IS for you.<br /><br />\\"House of Leaves\\" is indeed an experimental novel, but it's not precisely avant-garde. Everything follows a single cohesive storyline, even if it doesn't seem like it. Every digression and footnote is relevant, and enriches the experience.<br /><br />However, again, you must be patient, and you have to enjoy perusing a book at leisure--speed-reading does no good here (trust me, I'mm a speed reader).<br /><br />I don't want to go too much into the storyline (it's way too easy to offer spoilers) but basically, \\"House of Leaves\\" follows one man's discovery of a another man's archives documenting truly horrifying events chronicled by a pair of films that do not exist. These films were supposedly created by a professional photographer who was documenting his family's experience moving into a new house. Worse--or better, if you're into horror--those horrifying events are not really under the constraints of place or even time.<br /><br />It if sounds convoluted, it's really not. Or, at least, it's easy to understand; you might have to read the above sentences a couple of times, but you absorb these facts almost by osmosis when you're reading \\"House of Leaves.\\"<br /><br />I'm afraid to say too much, because spoilers are much to easy to give away here, and while there's probably enough surprises and revelations in this novel that revealing a couple wouldn't make much difference on the book's impact, I don't feel like spitting anything out. I will say this is a very scary novel. If you're any kind of horror fan who longs, at least on occasion, for something beyond the usual spatter and gore, then \\"House of Leaves\\" is a must. If you're a reader looking for the next big thing--or at least the next talked-about thing--in literary forms, you, also, should read it. If, however, you're into perfectly streamlined, evenly chapter-divided stories that do not digress and get themselves over with quickly--or at least cleanly-- skip it. \\"House of Leaves\\" is a worthwhile experience--extremely worthwhile, in my opinion--but it is not easy, and it is often frustrating. This is not because it is difficult to read; rather, it is because you want to know every answer as soon as the question pops up. At times, it feels like it can't possibly make any sense, like the footnotes and notes and side stories can't possibly add to the story, like it's a waste of time.<br /><br />Trust me, though.<br /><br />It's not.<br /><br />This book isn't a runaway, blockbuster, billion dollar bestseller, and for several reasons. The form does put some people off. Also,it is genuinely frightening, and many people, contrary to what they say, do not actually like being afraid. However, the fact that it's been in steady print says something. \\"House of Leaves\\" will continue to develop a cult following; however, that should not be the sole factor in your decision to read or not read this book. It doesn't matter who likes or doesn't like \\"House of Leaves.\\" It is unique enough that both its fans and detractors are all kinds of people, from all walks of life and learning and experience. This book does not appeal to any one type of person. If you read it, you'll probably understand why.<br /><br />\\"House of Leaves\\" is one of the most unique, enthralling, confusing, frustrating, infuriating, and rich reading experiences I've had in the last couple of years. With the former caveats in mind--it doesn't get itself over with quickly, it is often frustrating, the digressions are almost like non sequiturs in places, and it's very frightening-- I would still reccommend this novel to most.
0142410349|4.0|I thought I'd read just about everything by Roald Dahl, and then I saw news that a new film was coming out based on Fantastic Mr. Fox by Dahl. I'd missed one! I rushed to the bookstore to pick up a copy.     The story concerns Mr. Fox and his family. They survive by picking off poultry from the surrounding farms owned by a set of stupid and repellent farmers. Those farmers, one day, determine to kill Mr. Fox and company, even if it means destroying their farms and all of the other wild animals in the area to succeed. Fox and family have to be creative in order to survive.    It's all, of course, a fun read with Dahl's characteristic humor and that acerbic edge that is so unique to him (though I do think the Lemony Snicket novels have something close). The best thing in this story (and in many of Dahl's) is the way the animals form a rag-tag community in order to battle back against the absurdity and ineptitude of those who hold and abuse power (the farmers). It's a nice vision, within a clever story, and it's one that always has an extra sense of authenticity because of the darkness Dahl's willing to portray in his stories. I'm glad now to have discovered this story, and I'm looking forward to seeing the movie that results from it.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|I have been watching Star Trek since it first aired Thursday evening in 1966.  This movie, as the viewer will discover, essentially is a \\"reset\\" of the original \\"Star Trek\\" future history; I will give away no more than that.  Star Trek 2009 is a hugely successful prequel to the Original Series scenario. Here, Kirk is a Midshipman at Starfleet Academy, Spock is a recent graduate, and the other members of the bridge crew are in various earlier stages of their careers. Every single one of them is well-cast in my opinion (Uhura, in particular, is excellent, and incredibly beautiful if I may say so.)<br /><br />The storyline is gripping, and despite almost too much action, it holds the viewer's interest at all times. By the way, the casting of Spock's parents Sarek and Amanda is impeccable, and Amanda is ravishing in this prequel. No wonder Sarek fell in love with her!<br /><br />The special effects in this film are spectacular, and beautiful. One anomaly, if that is what it is, is that this USS Enterprise (under command of Captain Pike) is cooler and more high tech than the original, or even than most of the Enterprise incarnations in the various films. No matter, I liked that.<br /><br />Star Trek purists may have some problems with this film because it is not entirely consistent with the Star Trek universe as most of us understood it, even from the beginning. Spock for a time is senior to Kirk, for example. Further, I always had the understanding that Kirk and Spock did not know one another, at least not well, until Kirk relieved Captain Pike as commander of the USS Enterprise. Well, this film does away with that notion! Obviously this was necessary if the main characters of the original series, i.e. Kirk, Spock, Uhura, Chekov, Sulu, McCoy, were to have major roles in this story, as indeed they do. I'll say it again: the casting here was just superb.<br /><br />Inconsistencies aside, this film absolutely reinvigorates the Star Trek franchise in a big way. I am certain that all fans of Star Trek will love this film, and it will no doubt capture new adherents from the younger set. The casting is so good that the ground is set for many sequels of this prequel, I trust and hope.that all fans of Star Trek will love this film, and it will no doubt capture new adherents from the younger set.

0307474275|5.0|\\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is an amazing book. It has action, and has some surprising educational information. However, if you read it, you shouldn't actually go to the places these people went and expect to find some kind of treasure. Because you won't find it. The book is fiction, so just read it for the thrill and mystery and don't go putting yourself into the main character's shoes!<br />(It's a good book!)
0385737424|5.0|This story kept me wondering and guessing right up to the end. I liked the suspense of the mysterious notes and events as well as the building excitement of Mom's appearance on the $20,000 Pyramid. Plus, it made me want to read A Wrinkle in Time all over again!
0143115014|1.0|I work in fragrance and the concensus is that this guy was bribed. For instance, he gives Estee Lauder's original Youth Dew top rating (four stars!) as one of the best out there. He says: \\"It smells terrific, top quality, sophisticated, and easy to wear.\\" Don't think so! I keep trying to make myself feel that way about Youth Dew because it'd save me a lot of money, but I can't! Then I see he rates a respectable Cartier fragrance as smelling like puke. The word authority should be no where near this guy's name. I think I must just throw this book out.....

B002BSHXJA|5.0|After listening to THE BEATLES' MONO BOX SET, I of course heard both similarities and differences between it and its companion, THE BEATLES' STEREO BOX SET.  I also, kept reading reviews about both of these sets.  Some prefer the mono set over the stereo set, and others prefer the stereo set over the mono set.  However, in terms of the sound of the music, I don't think that one is necessarily better than the other.  This opinion varies from person to person.  I'll give you comparisons and contrasts about the stereo albums and the mono albums, and then let you draw your own conclusions.  I've already explained in great detail about the Beatles' studio albums on the stereo set. (See my review on it.)  So, I'll try not to be as wordy on this review.  Anyway, here is the list of their mono albums:    I couldn't hear a huge difference on the first four albums:  PLEASE PLEASE ME, WITH THE BEATLES, A HARD DAY'S NIGHT, and BEATLES FOR SALE.  The only difference I can think of is that the vocals are somewhat louder on the mono albums than on the stereo albums.  For the mono albums, The Beatles and their producer, George Martin basically recorded with just one speaker.  As you know, 'mono' is the Greek prefix for, 'one...only...single'.  Therefore, I think that the group was trying to place more emphasis on the vocals and melody over the rhythm and percussion sounds.     The next two albums:  HELP! and RUBBER SOUL feature both mono mixes and the original stereo mixes of the songs.  If you hear the two mixes on the song \\"Help!\\", it sounds that both of the performances are different.  You'll have to listen to them in order to understand what I mean, beacuse it's hard to put into words.  On the song, \\"I'm Looking Through You\\", off of the RUBBER SOUL album, you'll hear a slightly different arrangement in the vocals at the end of the song on the mono version than on stereo version.  The lyrics Paul sings are somewhat different.    On REVOLVER, you'll hear more differences:  On thestereo version of \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", the bass and cellos are much louder at the beginning of the song and therefore affects the opening of the first verse.  Whereas, in the mono version, the sounds of the bass and cello at the beginning are more subdued.  In the song, \\"Yellow Submarine\\", you'll hear John Lennon say, 'life at ease'.  You don't hear that on the stereo version.  On the song, \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\", you hear more backwards guitar sounds before the solo.  The mono version of \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\", has louder brass sounds and has a longer time span than the stereo version.  Plus, Paul's vocals are somewhat different at the end.  On \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", the tape loops fade in and out faster and the guitar solo sounds different and the final note of it is cut out.    The differences on SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND are evident:  On \\"She's Leaving Home\\", the speed of the song if somewhat faster and is played at a higher pitch.  On \\"Within You Without You\\", the laughing at the end of the song is much louder and more sudden.  On \\"Being For The Benefit of Mr. Kite\\", the cross-fade at the end of the song is more sharp and sudden on the mono version.  Paul's scat singing at the end of \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band[Reprise]\\" is louder.  On \\"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds\\", the sound effects are more audible.  Some of the songs are longer-lasting and have quicker cross-fades than on the stereo versions.    I don't hear a huge difference on the mono versions of MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR.  However, I do remember that on the song, \\"Blue Jay Way\\", the scatting vocals are missing on the mono version.    THE BEATLES or what the public would call, THE WHITE ALBUM would prove to be the final album that the group and George Martin would make with both stereo and mono versions.  Well, here are some contrats on the mono versions:  On \\"Back in the U.S.S.R\\", the jet airplane noise is different throughout the song. The bird chipring noises are heard earlier inthe song, \\"Blackbird\\".  Pig grunt sounds on the song, \\"Piggies\\" are missing, and the ones that are heard are somewhat different.  On the song, \\"I Will\\", Paul's bass is not heard until after the first verse.  When you hear \\"Don't Pass Me By\\", you'll hear Ringo's voice at a higher tone and the song being at a faster speed.  On \\"Helter Skelter\\", the vocals are much louder, chuckling is heard at the beginning of the song, you hear 'beeping' sounds throughout, and there's a different drum arrangement at the end.  Finally, when the song fades out, it does not come back like on the stereo version.  Therefore, you don't get to hear Ringo make loud drum and cymbal hits and exclaim, \\"I've got blisters on my fingers!\\"    THE BEATLES MONO MASTERS features mono versions of songs not included on any of the original studio albums.  There are a few similarities between MONO MASTERS and PAST MASTERS,(the stereo album).  Both feature \\"Love Me Do\\"(Original Single Version), \\"She Loves You\\", \\"I'll Get You\\", and \\"You Know My Name (Look Up The Number)\\".  The recordings of these songs are in mono versions on both albums.  Now here are some differences:  Some of the harmonica riffs on the song, \\"Thank You Girl\\" which are heard on the stereo version are missing on the mono version.  Also, there are mono mixes of the following songs released for the first time:  \\"Only a Northern Song\\", \\"All Together Now\\", \\"Hey Bulldog\\", and \\"It's All Too Much\\".  These songs were originally mixed and released on stereo on the album YELLOW SUBMARINE.  The rest of the mono songs are not much different than their stereo companions.  It's just that more emphasis is placed on the vocals and melody than on rhythm, bass, and percussion.            There's always been a debate about which of the Beatles' remastered box sets is better.  This reminds me about the debate between different versions of movies like, THE EXORCIST, AMADEUS, or APOCOLYPSE NOW.  These three movies have both original theatical versions and extended versions released years later.  There were debates about whether the original versions or the extended versions are better.  It depends upon who you ask.  The same thing is true about these box sets.  Personally, I think both the stereo and mono box sets have their own distinct features:  The Stereo Box Set contains all the official studio albums and has been remastered to be accessible to just about anything that plays music; from a small portable CD player to an MP3 player.  Whereas the Mono Box Set was made to be listened to a portable CD player or 'normal' stereo, and to have the viewer capture a piece of history was mono was the mainstream.  (It became the mainstream right up until the 1970's.  Then stereo became the mainstream, and it's been that way ever since.)  There have been debates about which box set is better.  My answer is this:  In terms of the collection of all official studio albums, THE BEATLES STEREO BOX SET is the definitive one. (Note that it features YELLOW SUBMARINE, LET IT BE, and ABBEY ROAD.  All three of these albums were originally mixed in stereo, which is why they're not included in the mono box set.)  Now in terms of how versions sound, my answer is neither. Both have their own distinct features.  So I will say that the mono box set is great in its own way.  Well, that's my opinion.  Who cares?  Oh, one more thing.  When all else fails, JUDGE FOR YOURSELF!
B002MCJZHS|4.0|First off don't let the title mislead you - this album is very good.  But because of its sparse and dark sound it conjures images of an under-lit lounge where heroin chic teenagers slowly move about a crush red velvet room feeling the ecstasy of the drug run through their veins and delight in the shared environment.  Its sexy, hip, and low key.  The problem is I feel like Chairlift did the same exact thing last year and a bit better as they weren't held to this ambient idea and had some variation.  However, I personally feel I can not deny how artistically interesting this album is.  In a world of larger than life pop stars make bigger and heavily produced music, independents, such as the fore mentioned Chairlift, Feist (and to a lesser extent D.C.F.C. and Hot Chip), are going more simplistic in their sounds; and in that simplistically comes easy and relaxed music that, quite frankly, you could listen to on a lazy day reading or napping.  It becomes part of the space it plays in, or perhaps forces one to adjust their environment to it.  Either way its a sign of a good album.

B001BPJJ1E|2.0|I got my eagerly anticipated copy of the DVD a few days ago, and I have to say that they did a really lousy job. From the amateurish packaging done by someone who knows nothing about graphic design to the printing on the disc which is merely labeled with a single word \\"Melody\\". That's nothing compared to the quality of the actual movie print though. I don't know where they dug up this print (somebody's dusty attic?), but it has really been through the ringer. It has scratches and marks that never completely go away, the colors are completely washed out, it's grainy, and the sound is not very sharp. Several splices are obvious. Besides this, the only extra is a \\"slide show\\" of grainy screen captures from the movie with lame dissolves between the pictures.    It is also FULL SCREEN. Beware!    The packaging says \\"digitally remastered\\" and \\"enhanced audio\\". I don't really see how this can possibly be true.    The \\"unofficial\\" copy I bought off eBay is much, much better quality, AND it's in widescreen format.    So it's a huge disappointment, but at least it is officially released now, people can easily get it, and more people will see it.    Maybe Criterion Collection will pick it up and do it right!
068485743X|3.0|Ok, so I tried the exercise at the end of one of the first chapters: hone in on your adverbs and adjectives and see if you really need them. Lots of writers, including Stephen King, advise against adverbs particularly. Mr. Lukeman says odds are good you don't need them. Well, I went back to my prologue and crossed out (yes, on paper as an experiment) every adjective and adverb. There were quite a few I didn't need because they were redundant, so out they went. His point was well taken. But most remained.    Why? Because a writer needs to produce vivid imagery if his/her story is to SING. \\"The frothing waves\\" may make Mr. Lukeman puke, but there are many kinds of waves, so why not show what you mean?    If Stephenie Meyer left out half of her adjs. and overwrought adverbs, what are the odds her books wouldn't have sold so well? Sometimes, it pays to break the rules.  In her case, she knew her audience well -- an audience that must not mind the annoying adjs. and adverbs writers like Lukeman beg us to avoid.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|I, like the rest of the world, heard about the Film of the Year; \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\".  However, I never overheard a clear explanation of the plot and what I did hear was more confusing than helpful; a dramatic story built around a gameshow.  In addition, I read where 2009 was such a mediocre year that a movie like \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" might end up as Best Picture come Oscar time.    \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" IS a very good movie.  As it began, I thought that I was finding out too much too soon.  With all this information up front, how would the rest of the movie keep my attention.  Before long I realized the brilliance of its' cinematic concept; the answer to each question on the game show was learned in the school of Hard Knocks by our improbable hero, Jamal Malik.  Jamal has lived a tough life and every tragedy and misfortune was etched in his memory.  His seemimgly emotionless reaction to each correct answer on \\"Who Wants to be a Millionaire\\" was a testimony to the suffering the answer brought to mind.  Naturally, the movie lets us in on the \\"stories behind the answers\\".  Along the way, we meet other characters important in Jamal's life as they weave in and out of his story.  The ending is somewhat predictable but we would be greatly disappointed otherwise.    I guess \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" IS a dramatic story built around a game show.  However, it didn't take a mediocre year to give it a chance to win Best Picture.  It would have competed in any other year as well.
B002QEXN2K|2.0|I am not anti-mainstream music. I actually liked Continuum a lot... but this album is so full of the pop formula that it is boring to me.    On \\"Do You Know Me,\\" his nylon-string guitar is clearly out of tune.  Come on John, you're a professional!    Taylor Swift sings what, TWO lines?!    What happened to the bold John venturing out into blue trio territory?  Pino Paladino and Steve Jordan pushing him to his musical limits?  No longer.  It feels like he has regressed into what was comfortable, safe, and conservative.    Has he grown as a musician since Continuum?  Sure, it shows in his technique, his note choices, his lick phrasings.  Does it show in his songwriting?  In my opinion, not one bit.
0385504225|4.0|Mr. Brown has created a real page turner. Although the Lost Symbol stretches plausibility in some cases, the basic story line is very good. It really commands the reader's attention. Although I'm not a 33rd degree Mason, he seems to make fun of the Masonic rituals for the 33rd degree. The casual reader would enjoy this book and also be motivated to visit the buildings in Washington DC both Masonic related and others.
B002QEXN2K|1.0|It appears Continuum remains John Mayer's pinnacle achievement on all accounts, and compared to this disappointing effort, Continuum is a masterpiece - an overused term (like \\"genius\\") I try to avoid as long as possible.    To put it bluntly, in my opinion `Battle Studies' fails to deliver BIG time. There's simply NOTHING here that hasn't been heard a thousand times in similar country & blues tinged white pop music - not melodically, not harmonically and certainly not thematically (despite Mayer's hopes with ostentatious titles such as \\"War Of My Life\\").    If this was a demo of an unknown recording artist hopeful, or even the debut cd of someone else, it wouldn't have the impact that it (most likely) will just because it's by an established young artist like Mayer.     The 11+ songs seem to be either variations of each other, or Mayer's previous songs. There's even a Clapton throwaway cover (\\"Crossroads\\"), there's not one but two songs that sound suspiciously similar to \\"Heart Of Life\\" and \\"Stop This Train\\".     In interviews, he also seems to have a major \\"I'm a songwriting god that only comes once in a century\\" complex, without even a hint of self irony. Well, based on this effort, someone should deliver him the bad news.

B002ONC9MS|4.0|The year is 1961. Sixteen year-old Jenny (played by 24 year-old Carey Mulligan) is the star pupil in her English class and entertains hopes of one day attending Oxford college. This hope is encouraged by her teachers (one of which is played by the beautiful Olivia Williams who here downplays her beauty with plain clothes, no make-up, school marm bun, and thick glasses) and her parents and so her days are spent studying for exams. In her spare moments Jenny reads French literature and listens to French records. Jenny has no real problems or conflicts; she has supportive parents and teachers, talent, and plenty of friends.  However, being an imaginative creature with tastes beyond her years, Jenny finds her routine suburban life of school and study dull. And like many teenagers, precocious or not, she feels stifled by those who only want the best for her. Only one boy expresses interest in her and he is an immature and restless dreamer who wants to travel to mainland Europe (not unlike Jenny herself)but he can never find the right thing or anything to say and he bores the very articulate and quick-witted Jenny. One day while Jenny waits for a bus in the rain a stranger (Peter Sarsgaard) offers to give her a lift. Because he can actually hold an adult conversation and thus her attention, Jenny is attracted to the much older David. When he asks her out several days later, she eagerly accepts.<br /><br />The film is based on a memoir by Lynn Barber and adapted for screen by Barber and Nick Hornby (who is best known for his novel High Fidelity). Danish director Lone Scherfig has an eye for period details (cars, fashion, furnishings) that give this film an authenticity often lacking in many other period films. This year--situated as it is at the beginning of one of the most transformative decades in western history--seems to be a particularly well chosen one in which to set this portrait of Jenny and middle-class English society since both are just beginning to test the waters of those changes to come. This transitional moment (in that limbo between 1950's conservatism and 1960's liberalism) seems to be getting a lot of attention in film of late. I suspect this is because this tension between conservative traditionalism and permissive liberalism is still being played out in our personal and social lives. We have plenty of films that criticize the 1950's for being stifling, kitschy, and counterfeit; and plenty of films that claim that the 1960's supposedly liberated us from those inauthentic and materialistic norms. What we don't have are many films that take a more measured look at this transitional period (just how much has the world changed and just how much have those pesky norms persisted?) or this transitional time in life (what exactly is an education?). This film takes a measured look at both.<br /><br />The cars, the furniture, the fashion, the jazz records, the paintings, the cigarettes at first appear to be there merely to provide background and atmosphere but of course background and atmosphere are important when they are the things that are seducing the main character. The real love story here is not between Jenny and David but between Jenny and culture. Thats what really creates and holds the viewer's interest, thats what's really being documented by Barber's memoir and this film. The real event of Jenny's seventeenth birthday is not the loss of her viriginity, but the contact she makes with live Jazz, and Paris (not the dream of it but the actual place): these are what she falls in love with ,and, consequently, what facilitate her rapidly evolving sense of self. Our characters are formed, Jenny's teachers and books say, from our experiences. However, the teachers themselves, Jenny is quick to note, do not appear to have had much firsthand experience of the world. Her teachers all try to warn Jenny about David because they all assume that the relationship is distracting her from what really matters, Oxford. But Jenny isstill discovering what really matters to her. And she questions the value of an education that is so narrowly focused on book learning and the acquisition of advanced degrees. Certainly one thing that David introduces Jenny to is sexuality but of all the things that he introduces her to that is perhaps the least interesting to her. Sexuality--that much-heralded liberator of so many 1960's films--is all but absent from this film, the intimate scenes are brief non-events; sexuality, Jenny finds, is not much of a teacher, nor a liberator (the poets, it would seem to Jenny, have overstated the importance of the act). What Jenny really finds liberating is firsthand experience, and what experience teaches her is what matters most to her and what matters most to those around her. What she finds matters most to her parents is not education but financial security (hers and theirs); and what she finds matters most to her teachers is book learning and degrees. The only people that seem to really care about and value experience and living are David and his friends. She envies their experience-rich lives, and they envy her natural talents; it is a two-way seduction. It is experience that teaches Jenny who Jenny is which is the biggest lesson of her early life. It is also experience that teaches her to look with more sympathetic eyes on the lives of others, especially on her teacher Miss Stubbs.<br /><br />This brings me to what I thought was going to be a criticism of the film. At first I thought the film failed to develop Miss Stubbs and I thought this was a major flaw. But the more I think about it the more I suspect that this character is not undeveloped, just purposefully left ambiguous. In 1961 England an Oxford educated woman had two career options: teaching and civil service. The Miss Stubbs' role is therefore extremely important as Miss Stubbs represents the kind of future that is available to and awaits Jenny if she is indeed accepted to Oxford. When Jenny looks at Miss Stubbs she is therefore also in many ways eyeing her own future. At first Jenny perceives Miss Stubbs to be frumpy and sexless and sad but like all of her other perceptions in this film that perception shifts. For most of the film we see Miss Stubbs as Jenny does--a  schoolteacher with no personal life or identity apart from that role. When we finally do see her not at school but in her own home in her own clothes we see she is not exactly a beauty but not at all plain either. We do not know exactly what her life is like but we do know that she surrounds herself with the things she loves which happen to be the same things that Jenny loves. Since the Miss Stubbs character is left somewhat ambiguous, it is never made clear whether a life spent contemplating culture is a good life, a satisfying life, or not. It would seem that her life is highlighted by art but also lonely as it seems that she has no one to share those experiences with. Whether this is the life that Jenny sees herself living in ten or twenty years is unclear; what does seem clear is that both \\"women\\" (by films end Jenny does seem like she has begun to acquire the wisdom she has been seeking; by this films criteria it is wisdom and not sexuality that makes a woman) seem to have learned something from the other: Miss Stubbs, one suspects or at least hopes, will perhaps become more daring and seek connections with people and not just works of art, and Jenny will channel her curiousity and daring in more sophisticated and less naive ways.<br /><br />This is a quiet film that does not necessarily make a strong immediate impact, but that nonetheless resonates days after viewing.ng what really matters to her.

To make it look like it was actually his survial book in the woods, he stomped on it, kicked it around, pricked his finger with a pin to let blood drip on some of the pages, and dripped coffee on some pages, too.

B0025UHKNS|1.0|This new 'touch bezel' feature is the most frustrating experience with ANY piece of technology that I have ever dealt with. Just setting the watch after my wife tossed it at me after trying to set it up herself took over a half hour to change the gender to 'female' and her birth date. I totally gave up on the weight setting after trying multiple times to change it. The 'experience' is so awful that I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. It *might* have some usefulness as a training device but the bizarre 'touch bezel' is so frustrating that I'd give up on the whole thing and toss it into a drawer. I was particularly disappointed in this product as I have several other Garmin products (Forerunner 50, Nuvi 1390t, Vista cx, GPSMAP 76) and love them enough to upgrade and recommend them, but not this thing.    Too complicated, too random, pushing 'technology' for technologies sake. She got this thing to help her log her progress. The upfront frustration could spell doom for its future around here. She usually hands down technology that she can't/won't use. I don't want this thing. Maybe this is defective, but tapping the four areas does work, the 'scrolling' feature is the bit that doesn't work. Something like one scroll happens out of every dozen or so times it's attempted. FRUSTRATING! Like adding one more button to scroll the screens would have killed it... Sometimes I don't understand product designs. Sometimes the execution is just so bad...    For a company that usually makes such well thought out products, this one was released too soon in my opinion. Two thumbs down... (We'd return it except that she has had it unopened too long to be able to return it.)    EDIT: I was thinking of how Garmin could fix this product or should have made it better. Make it able to be setup from the computer that it's linked to. Simple. You have to connect it to download the data, right? Garmin uses a USB cable to charge the thing and provide updates, right? So how 'revolutionary' wouldit have been to allow for setting up the thing through the USB cable? I imagine such a product. Ahh, the simplicity... The joy of using such a more simpler and well thought out device... Come on Garmin. I know that you can do better... (Now I'm hoping the ANT system works as well as it does for my Forerunner 50. (She got the 405 because I raved about the 50, ironically))
0226264211|5.0|I am an avid proponent of Free Market Capitalism.  This is one of the most comprehensive, yet concise works I have read on the subject to date.  Friedman does a fantastic job to present his concepts in easily digetsible chunks which make this book a fantastic book to occupy your mind during a subway/train ride to work and back, or an easy evening read before bed-time.  Although this book is a few decades old now the basic concept of Freedom will never change.  I believe that readers of all ages will get something from this book.    Highly Recommended!!
B002QEXN2K|3.0|I'm a big fan of John Mayer and I must say I'm a bit disappointed by this album. While it's nowhere near as good as Continuum was (which was a perfect blend of blues and pop), this one seems to be back in Heavier Things territory. I don't know why 'Who Says' is the lead single because it's a pretty bland song, and alot of  songs of this album seems to be fairly similar in nature. Songs that actually stand out a bit include \\"Assassin\\" and \\"Edge of Desire\\". Taylor Swift only gets two lines in the supposed 'duet' and 'Crossroads' sounds like an 8 bit version of the classic song.     My personal favorites, ones that are decent (but still doesnt match up to anything off Continuum):  -Perfectly Lonely, very catchy  -Heartbreak Warfare, epic feel  -Friends lovers or nothing, nice piano ballad  -All we ever do is say goodbye, very mellow guitar piece
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|Michael's music will never get dull.  Even though I have all these songs on other CD's it's great to get them on one, plus \\"This Is It\\".  His music never gets old and you can listen to it all the time.  I hightly recommend this to all MJ fans!!!!!  Can't wait for the DVD to come out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Peg
B002R4K6AG|1.0|Insipid versions of holiday classics that never deserved to be released.  Dylan's voice, an acquired taste even in its' finest moments, sounds as if he's been gargling with old razor blades.  Throughout my first (and only) listen to this mess-terpiece, I couldn't help but think that even Wild Man Fischer would have had more self-respect than to issue such drek.  Absolutely dreadful and should be avoided at all costs.
B000F4RHB6|4.0|Great exeprience of comming back to the times when HLatN were on the top. Nice review of the best. Still more songs from Four Chords & Several Years Ago  would be great but anyway worth to buy.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I thoroughly loved the movie so I bought the sound track.  Too much to explain if you haven't seen the movie.  Every track brings back vivid memories.  Especially love the one with the \\"Sirens\\".
B00006L7XQ|5.0|There's very little doubt in my mind that \\"American IV: The Man Comes Around\\" is a great work, and like a lot of great art, it asks more questions than it answers.  That's also true of Johnny Cash.  Does that make him a great man?<br /><br />It seems likely - I can't think of many other artists in any style who wrote one of their best works at such an advanced age, but that's exactly what Cash did with the title tune, \\"The Man Comes Around\\".  This song sets the tone in a lot of ways for the rest of the album - it sounds like a sermon, but rather than an attempt to explain the spiritual world, it's more like an attempt to fathom it.  In his liner notes, Cash confirms that a lot of those images come from the Book of Revelation, but they're presented as less judgmental than simply descriptive, and Cash's voice is less triumphant than stunned.<br /><br />Of course, he had good reason to be surprised at this point.  Who would have thought that Johnny Cash would not only be recording for hip-hop king Rick Rubin at this time of his life, but that he would be such a smash at it that he had to do it four times?  This might explain his famous decision to record some astonishingly out-of-character songs for this set.<br /><br />He included a few originals, including his old standard \\"Give My Love to Rose\\", and a few traditional favorites like \\"Streets of Laredo\\", but this album got the most attention for Nine Inch Nails' \\"Hurt\\" and Depeche Mode's \\"Personal Jesus\\".  If you listen to the original versions of those numbers, you have to ask yourself what possessed the Man in Black to perform a couple of synthesizer tunes with industrial overtones of all things.<br /><br />Before we get into that, I'm going to talk a little about the rest of the album, because I think those two cuts actually fit into it pretty well.  Cash was always interested in the extremity of human experience - all you have to do is listen to \\"Ring of Fire\\" and you understand that.  This includes everything from passion and ecstasy to despair and death, very often leavened with a healthy dose of laughs.  \\"American IV\\" is in some ways the ideal of this approach to music, and the stripped-down accompaniment brings the themes into sharp relief.<br /><br />Cash's voice adds a lot, too.  It was always a devastating instrument, of the kind that sounded like it could bring the walls of the temple crashing down, but let's face it - in 2002 the man was in his late 60s and suffering from a chronic blood condition, and the voice had worn down a lot.  It sounds less like the voice of God than the voice of a very stubborn man, which is exactly what most of this music needs.  (I have to admit that the few guest vocalists don't add much - Rubin would have done better to leave them off.)<br /><br />So these tunes and their arrangements range all over the emotional map.  They're full of love, death, despair, cynicism and hilarity.  Those are eternal subjects that synth bands also grapple with, so why not include their material?<br /><br />There are those who say that Cash made \\"Hurt\\" and \\"Personal Jesus\\" sound like old country ballads, but I can't agree.  They sound like Johnny Cash songs, all right, but the chordal approaches are a little too modern to sound anything like the Carter Family.  Cash turns \\"Hurt\\" (which Nine Inch Nails recorded as an off-key whisper of rage and pain) into a demand for hope, and he turns \\"Personal Jesus\\" (which Depeche Mode recorded as an attack on televangelism with a shuffle beat) into a gospel tune in straight 4/4 time.  We're used to thinking that this age of the world doesn't believe in anything, but Cash's version of the old music hall number \\"Sam Hall\\" is way more cynical than either one of these modern numbers, and funnier too.  Apparently, this age of the world isn't quite as materialistic as we thought.  Trust Johnny Cash of all people to find the faith in industrial music and the people who make it.<br /><br />It's almost like Cash knew he might not have another chance to sing for us and decided to stuff it all in, but it doesn't sound stuffed - drums appear on only one cut (\\"Tear Stained Letter\\", and boy do I wish he had decided to record Richard Thompson's song of the same name), there's no bass or electric guitar at all, and the producers had the good sense to bring in a couple of Tom Petty's Heartbreakers just to make sure things stayed tasteful.<br /><br />But it's Johnny Cash's show, and a phenomenal way to ring down the curtain.  His wife June died shortly after \\"American IV: The Man Comes Around\\" came around, and Johnny didn't last much longer than that.  I imagine that now he has answers to the questions this album raised.  The rest of us are left with the questions, but that's not at all a bad thing, especially when in comes in a form like this.<br /><br />Benshlomo says, When the old man asks a question, we'd do well to listen.in, but it doesn't sound stuffed - drums appear on only one cut (\\"Tear Stained Letter\\", and boy do I wish he had decided to record Richard Thompson's song of the same name), there's no bass or electric guitar at all, and the producers had the good sense to bring in a couple of Tom Petty's Heartbreakers just to make sure things stayed tasteful.

B00004HYLF|5.0|5 Stars = Masterpiece<br /><br />Return to Forever is a band I got familiar with very late in the game. I had heard of them as early as Junior High school in the mid 70's, but did not pick up any of their material until around ten years ago, & that was a compilation that really did not perk my interest, so it was probably five years ago when I bought \\"Hymn for the Seventh Galaxy\\" & \\"Romantic Warrior,\\" both outstanding albums!<br /><br />\\"Romantic Warrior,\\" probably is my favorite fusion album of all time, & one of my top twenty favorite albums, period. Funny thing though, it was only about 3 or 4 years ago that I really got into it. I had been to a bar & ran into a buddy of mine, we lit up a number before I left, then I went home. It was a warm summers night, not a cloud in the sky, I had a compact stereo outside I'd listen to in the warm months (little bugger kicked ass!!!) & I threw on \\"Romantic Warrior,\\" WOW, it was like I had sex for the first time! The album just blew me away! The musicianship, the melodies, the time changes, the totally ethereal experience was sublime beyond all reason! Each & every song a true individual, but greater as a whole whole! I was hooked & hooked good! My mind just opened up like a giant vortex & sucked all it could of the sweet opium scented sound that was floating into my ears from my speakers! Talk about a revelation! \\"Romantic Warrior\\" just did not stop, nor I with it! It's a true love affair that will stand the test of time!<br /><br />I can't emphatically recommend \\"Romanic Warrior\\" enough! It is a perfect album of perfect instrumental/musical ideas complimenting a genre which is seldom perfected. A true treasure for those inclined to submit their selves to a grand listening experience that is at once very demanding, but once entered into freely, surprisingly accessible! A true fusion lovers experience, not to be missed by true fusion lovers!
0061537969|5.0|As a dog lover I loved this book and its wisdom. I had never thought of life from a dog's perspective before. It is a tear jerker but most dog stories are. The uniqueness of this one is that the reader is looking to the ending as the dog and from his standpoint.
B002Q4U9YU|4.0|So, that's exactly what I'm going to do. When I get the DVD of This Is It, I'm going to pull the audio out of it, and listen to the music that way. Maybe it will make me nuts, as not all the songs will be complete, but I dug the sound in the theater. I'll then find out if that great theatre live sound was really something I can reproduce at home or in the car or not. Heck, even the mix that you hear in Live In Bucharest is great just because of it being live. Here's hoping that the DVD is really two DVD's....I could watch a lot more of all those dancers trying out for the show. And that dance teacher...man...she was hot. So, this is not a review of the CD...it's a tip for getting the real soundtrack. On a Mac, I use audio hijack.
B001FB4W0W|2.0|First, if you love the book series - you will be dissappointed. However, as a series I thought this was good, because I like the genre, but it took me a bit to get past how it fails the books it is based on.<br /><br />I had no problem with the series developing minor characters - they're interesting, one of Ms. Harris' talents. However, the series couldnt seem to stop themselves from layering certain characters to an almost ridiculous level. LaFayette is flamboyant and naughty, perfect as a regular in the series. However, producers kept the flamboyant, gay cook, but also made him a drug dealer and part-time prostitute. Same thing with ego-centric Jason Stackhouse. However, this character is personally disgusting. Instead of seeing how he can be repulsive in his attitude - he lives in squalor and general behavior leaves little to sympathize with.<br /><br />I think they could have done better.
B000003BQW|5.0|like most ramone fans back in the day i remember thinking oh man dee dee gone now what was gonna happen to the ramones .the ramones had been pretty much been just going thru the motions thru the late 80s although i still loved 89s brain drain .i was leery of this new bass player cj.but when mondo bizzaro came out it had the name deedee ramone on the song credits so it was nice to see he was still present even though hes not playing on the album.and man the 3 songs or so he added where awsome .all in all its a very good cd with alot to offer well produced .just sucked it went under the radar in the u.s.a .but sold huge in south america.so i say buy it youll be glad you did.we ramones fans only have 14 studio albums to enjoy so be like me and get them all......then you can get there live ones....
B001KVZ6FW|2.0|Rented the movie today and thought it was only OK.  Certainly didn't live up to the Pixar reputation like the Incredibles and Toy Story.  It was rather violent for an animated film and there was no solid plot to follow. Funny parts throughout the movie, but I can't see a child getting into it or being able to follow it.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|Nothing much to add to the trunk-full  of  reviews except that the stunts alone are worth the price of admission. Add to that a script that gives Willis the wherewithal to keep the character vital and you have a picture worth seeing. Of course, it is not the type of violence that seems real which makes it entertaining not frightening.
0807126063|5.0|Many reviewers explain their dislike of this novel by pointing to the fact that the characters aren't likable.  Since when do all the characters have to be cotton candy for one to read it?  The locale of the novel is interesting, the plot is well-handled, the characters are vibrant, the dialogue - especially in dialect - rings true, the book is not overlong,there is a glorious humor that surrounds everything, and the book holds up upon re-reading.
0316042994|5.0|Other reviewers have commented on the elements of the plot so I won't do so here.    What a great cast of characters! Each profoundly deep and profoundly real. In modern literature and pop cultural depictions, religious characters are usually one dimensional and lack empathy. It's either the 'spiritual' character who is tolerant and affirming of all or the more commonly represented by a close-minded, dogmatic individual. The depictions in Brideshead Revisited are deeper and nuanced. I would say that this book is almost a case study in Cognitive Dissonance - a concept not dwelt on nearly enough by most people. Despite their foibles and sins, the religious characters of the book maintain some semblance of faith and some desire for righteousness. We live in a time where Hypocrisy is the greatest of sins; the prescription being if you can't act out what you believe, change your beliefs. This book puts forward just the opposite solution (though the book is not preachy in the least) - maintain the faith and keep on keeping on.
0330449605|5.0|This book is classically written. Its clean, nice, enjoyable perhaps for the more old fashioned type.  It's hard to find such a book nowadays and I'm very happy I discovered it. It makes you feel good reading it. Sometimes you want a break from the fast paced modern writing, which I also enjoy but I enjoy variety as well.

B000Q6GUT8|5.0|Shooter is a solid movie about a former U.S. Miltary Sniper, Bob Lee Swagger, who is abandoned by the army and left for dead in Africa.    He returns home and makes a living in a secluded part of the country with almost zero contact to the outside world. He's tabbed by Danny Glover, a former purple heart winner himself, to plot an assassination attempt against the President in order to prevent the assassination.    Swagger scouts the locations where the President is going to speak and finally figures out that the only possible place is in Philadelphia. He is with Glover's outfit at the time to prevent the assassination only to unknowingly become part of the plot.    Swagger gets away and slowly starts exposing the truth behind the attempted murder, but not of the President, but of an Ethopian priest who was speaking before the president.    On his way, Swagger runs into Michael Pena, who plays FBI Agent Nick Memphis. Memphis is fresh out of graduation from the Academy and is suddenly thrown into presidental detail? all be it, from a very long distance away.    Shooter is a back and forth action movie with a deep story that you have to pay attention to. My only problem with the film was the acting of Michael Pena, at the very beginning it's very corny and fake.    -He's fresh out of the Academy and all of a sudden on Presidential detail?  -He's pretty much figured out within a day that Swagger didn't shoot anybody  -He's found out who or what shot the Priest    the other thing i didn't like, and this more than anything, was the fact that the \\"shooter\\" of the priest is exposed way to early in the film.    The viewer should have been left to ponder who or what did the shooting rather than giving it away so soon in the film.     but overall, Shooter is a good Saturday Night film, well worth watching.
0307269981|5.0|If you read the first in the series, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, this book is even better.  If you haven't read the first, please do so.  The third is coming out in May, and for the first time I will pre-order a book.  I'm not much of a reader, but this series is great and impossible to put down.
1594132666|2.0|Although many reviews of EPL have already been published, I could not resist the temptation to publicly critique Ms. Gilbert.  To begin, I share the skepticism of all those who have questioned her motivation for the year of traveling, as well as the authenticity of her emotional crisis.  She admits that her supposed suffering was largely due to poor choices, and her unwillingness to explain the source of unhappiness within her marriage makes one wonder if the problem did not originate with her.  Part one (eating in Italy) is well-written and sometimes witty, but as I concluded that part, I thought, \\"So what?\\"  Gilbert had talked a lot about crying and eating, but there was no real substance to be found in that section.  Also, everything was just too cutesy and perfect.  A friend named Luca Spaghetti?  A sexy young Italian study partner (with an equally sexy twin) who just happened to be sensitive beyond his years?  C'mon already.      Part two (praying in India) is painfully boring.  It is also the most conspicuously contrived.  What are the odds of going to a hidden ashram somewhere outside of Mumbai and fortuitously meeting up with a perfectly stereotypical middle-aged Texas male -- cleverly named Richard from Texas -- who says things like:  \\"Man, they got mosquitoes 'round this place big enough to rape a chicken.\\"  Rape a chicken?  And, what are the odds that this stereotypical Texan would give you the nickname \\"Groceries\\" because you eat a lot?  Gilbert's creative well is running dry at this point.  In fact, her overall writing begins to deteriorate in part two, as she clearly struggles with humor and metaphor -- among other things.  Consider this:  \\"Outside the walls of the Ashram, it is all dust and poverty.\\"  Very colloquial and indifferent, and probably does not do justice to the level of poverty that she saw there.  (I should also point out here that Gilbert used the word \\"all\\" probably a hundred times, as in \\"all dust and poverty,\\" or \\"all happy.\\"  It really got old.)  I lost interest in part two when Gilbert described a young Indian friend as \\"the cutest little bookworm of an Indian girl you ever saw.\\"  It reminded me of a white co-worker who referred to her Native American husband as \\"my little Indian.\\"  Condescending and stereotypical.  Part two is also a bit preachy and grandiose, and you will not be left with the impression that Gilbert was ever truly aware of India.  Her supporters may say that she did not go to India to experience the suffering of the people but to have a spiritual experience in the ashram.  While that would be a valid point, the level of spiritual enlightenment that she achieved in India could have been achieved anywhere else in the world -- including her native New York.      Part three (loving in Indonesia) was a little more interesting than I anticipated.  It also read faster than part two, which was good.  Some things, however, still seemed contrived.  For example, the first person Gilbert met in Bali was an Indonesian hotel worker who called himself Mario and just happened to share Gilbert's penchant for all things Italian.  She met a traditional healer, Wayan, who happened to have a little girl named Tutti, which, in Italian -- here's the ubiquitous Italian theme again; she simply will not let it go -- means everybody.  When she contracted a bladder infection after too much sex with her much older Brazilian boyfriend, she went to Wayan, who gave her an herbal concoction which fixed the problem within two hours!  The reader wonders:  Why did she not simply go to a hospital?  Are there no hospitals in Bali?  Of course there are hospitals in Bali.  However, being treated by a stereotypically cute witch doctor makes for a better story.  Perhaps the most unbelievable thing that Gilbert did in part three was to raise $18,000 (in one short week, mind you, thanks to her apparently affluent friends and family in the States and around the world) to help Wayan buy a house.  She naively turned allthe money over to Wayan, and the house did not get built before she left the island.  Wayan promised that the building would start the same week that Gilbert was scheduled to leave, but I would love to know if it ever happened.  Part three concludes with the following ridiculous poem/formula:  \\"Australia, America, Bali, Brazil = A, A, B, B.\\"  As the teenagers say -- duh! (Gilbert and her Brazilian lover plan to live an international romance in the four places.)  Despite the weaknesses in part three, it contains a few interesting passages about Balinesian history and culture.  It is for that reason that I give the book two stars instead of one.  My advice to potential readers is this:  If you are willing and able to completely suspend judgment, and you do not mind being lectured on religion by someone with no greater knowledge than yourself, then this is a great book.  However, if you look at it critically, you will see that it is, for the most part, dull, frivolous, and contrived.  Because Julia Roberts is currently filming the movie, the book will undoubtedly be given new life.  If you must read it, then do yourself a big favor and buy a used copy or check one out from the library.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|The first season of Supernatural, is a \\"must-see\\" part of popular culture. Anyone who likes comedy, drama and a good old fasion scare, will love supernatural. Sam and Dean are looking for their father, and soon discover what really happened during their childhood, Who killed their mother!?        In every episode Sam and Dean must fight a new creature of the night, to make the world a safer place. And the dark and scary mood of the first season is a work of art. The episodes vary quite a bit, in one episode there is a lot of brother drama, in another you will laugh so hard, but what they all have in common is the fact that you will be watching them with the doors locked and the light on. They give you the good old scare!

B001FB4W0C|5.0|The fourth season of supernatural is one of the crazyest seasons yet. Sam and dean are no longer fighting just evil spirits, warewolfs and such, they are now fighting for the truth!

And sam is practising his demon.blood powers and the season is the sickest one yet!
B00005JKHP|5.0|1979, 10 years after 'The Original Series' went off the air, this movie comes out, the first Star Trek movie, and I do not know why this movie gets so much negativity, yes it's completely different than the rest of the movies (I like them all), this was Gene Roddenberrys true vision of Star Trek.    This is a very intelligent movie, which is the way Star Trek should be, you have to pay attention, or you won't get it, maybe some people just don't pay enough attention, because I cannot see how, if they did pay attention, could give it such a low rating, it really brings back the feeling of The Original Series.    The acting of course is great, all the original cast of course, and they picked it up 10 years later as if they were just doing the following episode to 'Turnabout Intruder', and the story, is just intelligent, a space probe lost in space for 200 years, with the help of an alien race of machine beings, stayed out there and collected all the information it could over the time span, and eventually became so smart by collecting all that information, V'cher became an entity.    Just a wonderfully thought out story, and intelligent, and the spaceshots/effects, you can definetly tell it's 'Star Trek'    On a side note, I would suggest buying the new 'Original Motion Picture Collection' box set, available on both blu-ray and standard definition, and if you're a fan of 'The Next Generation', pick up 'The Next Generation Motion Picture Collection' as well, same as the other set, available in both blu-ray and standard.

B000R209NY|4.0|For those of you who have not seen the original Poseidon movie with Shelley Winters, this remake matches or exceeds the original.<br /><br />Unsinkable boat sinks. There are those that are willing to go down with it knows that her paralyzed by the experience and then there are those who are adventurous survivors. Which are you? We have hours of great entertainment watching those who would survive to see if they do survive and those that don't how they don't. There is some emotion some romance some fear of heights so forth but the real movie is will they get out.<br /><br />All the actors are quite well known and well seasoned the few that are new hold up just as well. The dateline is the present date so there are no problems with Period Pieces or having to match period Costumes. There are lots of fire lots of water and an upside down perspectives on boating.<br /><br />There's no redeeming social value to this film but it will have fun kibitzing with telling them aloud don't go there! Don't open that door! Here comes the water!
B000005JA8|3.0|Captain Beefheart and his Magic Band - Trout Mask Replica (1969)<br /><br />This one is waaaaay out there . . . one of the most \\"out there\\" albums ever made. Also one of the most challenging, inaccessible and polarizing.<br /><br />The main ingredients here are the standard guitar, bass, drums and vocal line up of your average rock band with some sax and other horns occasionally squealing away. There are no trippy mellotron flourishes or other spacey or radical sounds, yet music doesn't get much more bizarre than this.<br /><br />I actually love weird, avant-garde music (Faust, Mr. Bungle, Boredoms, etc.) but TROUT MASK REPLICA has always been just too much for me to take - until recently. A few months ago I started forcing myself to listen to it in an attempt to understand its appeal. I can report that I have come to actually enjoy it to some degree because it is so complicated and challenging and thus intriguing. These days I'll only put it on once in a blue moon and rarely will I sit through the entire album at once. But I have a new found respect for it. Much of the instrumentation is actually quite impressive and sometimes each of the instruments seems to be playing different songs at once. Quite disconcerting to be sure - and mind-warping! Playing these bizarre, off-kilter songs couldn't have been easy. In fact, the band supposedly rehearsed for an entire year while living in seclusion before they began recording (with Frank Zappa).<br /><br />TROUT weds Beefheart's growling, weird and whimsical prose with \\"music\\" (some refuse to call it that) that is so frantic, angular and jarring that the average listener will no doubt reject it out of hand. The most objectionable aspect of this music by far is its atonal quality, particularly from the guitar. Most of these songs have little regard for key or basic elements of song structure although a fundamental blues root can be detected at times. A few feature only Beefheart reciting/singing his poetry and it's quite . . . distinctive -- I like it! If you can give this album a while to sink in, you might find it to be very rewarding. If nothing else it will expand your musical mind in strange new directions and you will be exposed to something radically different than anything you've ever heard before - whether you like it or not.<br /><br />Tom Waits, who I love, was obviously greatly influenced by Beefheart. His voice came to take on a scruffy quality similar to The Cap'n's and he's also made reference to him in his lyrics. And Waits' music, of course, can get pretty weird as well. TROUT MASK REPLICA has had a huge influence on the music world, but mostly in terms of pushing musical boundaries I would say. Never have I heard anything that sounds like it, save Beefheart's own music. Those who dig this album will want to get its follow up, LICK MY DECALS OFF, BABY which continues more or less in the same chaotic vein as TROUT. Most of the other Beefheart music I've heard is rather poppy, almost run-of-the-mill blues-based music, although I know there's plenty of other Beefheart weirdness out there to be heard which I haven't gotten around to yet. I'm hardly a fan (and I doubt I ever will be) but I'm glad to have been exposed. Rating: caution.n give this album a while to sink in, you might find it to be very rewarding.

B001OQCV24|1.0|I like a good end-of-the-world yarn as much as the next moviegoer. But the makers of 2012 left out the critical ingredient: In their $200+ million orgy of visual effects, they forgot the essence of a good film - that it resonates with the human soul.<br /><br />It's hard to know where to start. The plot is boring and predictable. If you've ever seen a disaster film, then you've seen this one already, many times. The acting is wooden, the Russian accents pitiful, and the dialogue worst of all. The world is crashing and burning, and this is how people talk?!<br /><br />At one point near the beginning, I got confused and thought I was watching a comedy. The protagonist's ex-wife and her new husband are in a grocery store. He says to her, \\"I feel like something has come between us.\\" The very next second, a deep chasm splits the store in two, with her on one side and him on the other. (At that point, the writing is on the wall as to the stepfather's fate.)<br /><br />Even the visuals are so over-the-top that it became hard not to giggle. How many times can gigantic ripples of earth follow only inches behind our hero? How many toppling buildings can he drive under or fly through, without a scratch?<br /><br />Top critics (see Rotten Tomatoes) are near unanimous in their consternation over this humongous waste of talent and resources. Take movie critic Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal. He describes 2012 as an \\"oafish epic\\" with a \\"scatterbrained\\" script:<br /><br />\\"2012, Roland Emmerich's latest assault on planet Earth and its moviegoers, isn't the end of the world: It only feels that way. This oafish epic ... operates in a dead zone roughly equidistant between parody and idiocy.... [T]he cumulative effect is numbness.... 2012 has no discernible attitude toward the end of civilization, apart from the belief that there's a movie in it.\\"<br /><br />Finally, women (including Thandie Newton of Crash as the daughter of the President, played by Danny Glover) are strictly eye candy. When it comes to saving the world, it's a job for men alone.<br /><br />Men, and one small boy.rld, it's a job for men alone.     Men, and one small boy.
B002HWRYJE|2.0|I really liked this movie when I saw it in the theater.  So I pre-ordered it.  Nice price ($9.99).  Howver, the quality of the DVD is horrible.  It looks like it was recorded by an amateur, with glaring reflections almost obliterating some scenes.  Extremely disappointing!  I would have prefered to pay more and have a good quality DVD.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|The book reads like an episode of the show.  It is smartly written and brings the show's characters to life. It even incorporates nuances of the show that will add to the reading experience of Castle fans.
B001PR0YDA|5.0|Other reviewers have commented on the acting performances of Jim Carrey et al in Disney's new animated (\\"live action\\" performance capture) version of A CHRISTMAS CAROL by Charles Dickens. I'll simply say that Carrey is brilliant in his multiple roles; he's the Scrooge for the Ages.<br /><br />What I really want to rave about is the visual special FX of this production, especially the 3-D format, which will most assuredly be nominated for an Oscar. The opening sequence, in which the virtual camera soars over and through a marvelously re-created 1842 London, is worth the price of admission alone. My wife and I watched the film from the front row of an invitation-only studio screening. During a couple of scenes depicting falling snow, it seemed, through our 3-D glasses, that we could reach out and touch the descending flakes. And one is tempted to flinch backwards as the blackened, skeletal, claw-hand of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come apparently reaches out from the screen.<br /><br />It's been decades since I read the Dickens classic. (At least, I think I read it; memory fails.) I suspect that literary purists may object to embellishments of the original story, and over-protective parents may judge it too dark for small children. I say to those, \\"Get over it!\\" The visuals will simply knock your socks off and I'd award six stars if the rating system allowed such.<br /><br />You'll thank yourself if you make the decision to go see A CHRISTAMAS CAROL (2009) on the Big Screen. I'll happily go see it a second time, which isn't something I can usually say about an animated feature.

031606792X|1.0|I can't even express into words how strong my distaste for the entire Twilight Saga truly is. In my personal opinion Twilight is prefabricated, poorly written, shallow, demographic-forcing tripe. When I was a fourteen-year-old girl I was very obsessed with the vampire anti-hero Lestat from Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles. And though Lestat had many relationship issues he was still a better defined and more well conceived character than that of Edward Cullen.    Edward and Bella are poorly thought out, two dimensional shells. This was a deliberate effort by the author so that every young reader could imagine themselves as the main characters but in the process she made them so superficial that the characters lacked any quality of definition. They did not feel like real people.    Not only is Twilight poorly written but it also hinders upon actual mythology. The notion of vampires glittering in the sun is laughable at best. It brings to mind the recollection of such toys as the My Little Pony dolls. The logic behind vampires sparkling in the sunlight is non-existent. A vampire burning in the sun has been a staple of Gothic fiction for many years. There are real diseases and disorders in the world that make sunlight harmful to certain individuals. Scientifically it's more plausible to be harmed by sunlight than to 'naturally' sparkle in it.    Another flaw in the mythos of Twilight is the definition of werewolf. I cannot tell you how many times I have come across Twilight fans who insist the characters who can turn into wolves are not werewolves. They say that these characters are shape-shifters. A shape shifter by traditional definition can take on multiple forms, not just one. Many Twilight fans also argue that within the mythos of the books a true werewolf only changes on the full moon and that's why Jacob and company are not actually werewolves. The parapsychology student in me winces at this. In many traditional werewolf folklore out of Germany and France thereare werewolves that most certainly can change at will, are aware in their wolf form, and are not bound by the phase of the moon. The very word werewolf means man-wolf. It does not mean part man and part wolf. It comes from the notion of a man INTO a wolf. Most classic werewolf stories (before The Wolf-Man movie) had the werewolf changing from a person into an actual wolf.    The very first werewolf legend can be traced back to the Greek myth of King Lycaon. According to legend King Lycaon served human flesh at a feast for Zeus (the king of the Gods). Zeus was so offended that he punished Lycaon by turning him into a wolf. Only his eyes remained human. This myth is where the terms Lycanthrope, Lycanthropy and the more modern Lycan come from. I guess it's safe to say Stephenie Meyer does not do her research in regard to the occult before writing these stories.    Not only is Twilight poorly written and intellectually insulting to occultists (amateur and professional alike) but it also promotes very unhealthy relationships. Edward Cullen is abusive, stalkerish and obsessive. Edward has also had moments of physically harming Bella. Bella is equally so but that does not make it okay, nor does it make the relationship healthy. At one point Edward disables Bella's mode of transportation and has her kidnapped as a means to 'protect' her. If he was not a vampire this would be viewed as highly abusive of the character. There is a fine line between being chivalrous and sexist. Edward Cullen crossed that line miles ago. This sets a very unhealthy ideal of what defines romantic relationship for the young readers of Twilight. I am not saying not to read Twilight nor am I saying to burn the books. I am simply saying that it needs to be looked at in context for what it truly is and that there are far higher quality reads out there. If you want a chivalrous character who is NOT sexist, seek The Dresden Files novels by Jim Butcher. The hero, a wizard named Harry Dresden, is very chivalrous without being sexist.    Bella is what modern writers call A Mary Sue. In fiction writing and role playing games Mary Sue characters are strongly frowned upon. A Mary Sue is a character of shallow quality who is nearly flawless. The character is so perfect that even her so-called flaws are endearing.    I have run online text based role playing games since 1999 and I can tell you there are plot points in Twilight I would not have allowed in my game. A major one would be when Bella and Edward finally had their daughter toward the end of the book series the child aged extremely fast and by age seven or so she was involved with her mother's werewolf ex-boyfriend. To me this is disgusting. I would never have allowed this in my online role playing game. She might have developed with supernatural speed but she still has only had only seven-years-life experience and I feel that is certainly not enough time to be in a romantic relationship with a grown man. That was disturbing to me. Supernatural speed aging does not give her enough life experience for that sort of relationship. That was simply not right.    In short Twilight is not what I would consider a good read even for those who truly love supernatural romances. Seek out the likes of The Ghost and Mrs. Muir. Twilight is not worth the time. There are higher quality works of fiction out there.

This is a good read for anyone that has an addiciton problem or a family member with this horrible disease.

B000002H97|5.0|I was on a long drive recently and listened to all of the Metallica albums in order up to Live...Binge, and I must say that it made me realize what a huge difference Bob Rock's production and attitude made for these guys.<br /><br />The original band was far better, for my money: Cliff and Mustaine vs Kirk and Newsted? No comparison. But Rock saw where this band's real power lies: founders Ulrich and Hetfield. He clearly knew how to bring out their best in the studio, and he definitely mic'ed Lars' kit like no one before or since. Maybe the best huge drum sound since Bonzo. Massive.<br /><br />Plus, these tunes are among the best these guys ever wrote. I especially love Sad But True. What a huge riff, and Ulrich's drumming is truly awesome. This track exemplifies the main gift Bob brought to these guys, though I've never heard anyone mention it: he taught them how to swing.<br /><br />While listening to the first Metallica albums I get a little worn out sonically because everything is so on top of the beat. Everyone is pounding but those songs could be even heavier if there was more rhythmic push-pull, a la early Sabbath and middle Zep. Rock saw this and showed Lars how to pull back in the pocket a bit, which makes Hetfield's incomparably heavy rhythm riffs thunder like never before. Just listen to the huge pockets on Sad and Sandman. That's a new zone for Metallica, and I don't think they've topped it since.<br /><br />Nothing against Kirk or Jason, they're both decent, but they're playing with probably the best metal drummer and metal rhythm player of them all, so it's hard not to seem somewhat pedestrian. Hammett's solos get pretty boring after a while to me, but oh well. Newsted does lock in well with Lars' kick drum here, and that brings a lot of weight to the proceedings.<br /><br />I got caught driving in a sudden blizzard in the Rockies last week at 3 am and could barely see ten feet down the highway, so I put this album on and turned it up to 11 to keep me sharp. I will never forget that hour. Total whiteness meets total blackness; the focus and ferocity of the music really got me into the zone as I went over a high mountain pass and slowly came out of the snow. The perfect soundtrack to hair-raising intensity.<br /><br />I should mention that I saw a show on the first leg of this tour, and it remains one of the top five rock shows I've ever seen, of about two thousand. They were on fire and went off at least six times. Most bands get there once a night if they're lucky.<br /><br />I don't much care for their work since this album, but as peaks go, this is Everest among metal albums. The best drummer/rhythm team in heavy rock at their zenith.<br /><br />But you gotta play it loud, with a subwoofer.<br />Booooommm!tal whiteness meets total blackness; the focus and ferocity of the music really got me into the zone as I went over a high mountain pass and slowly came out of the snow.

B0024FAR5M|5.0|Could not stop watching it.  Loved it and can not wait for Season 2
0393312836|3.0|I first read Anthony Burgess's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE at the age of seventeen, several years before Stanley Kubrick's movie made the book famous. I even wrote a book report on it for my English class, though I cannot recall any details. When I started to reread the book recently, I at first put it aside as I had no stomach for reading about sadistic beatings, rape, and murder. However, since it had once made rather a strong impression upon not only me but a large segment of America's youth - I know of men who rave about A CLOCKWORK ORGANGE as the greatest movie ever made - I decided to read on to see if I could thereby visit my younger self. It is an ugly truth that the average man, more so younger men than those over forty, is fascinated and even excited by rape. This is probably even true of women. Ayn Rand's heroines typically drive the men they love into raping them; it is not only men who read and reread those passages. Men are often earnestly attracted to women who sneer at them, to which revenge fantasies are an almost reflexive response. (Whether a man is repulsed by such fantasies or enjoys them surely seems to be a matter of personal disposition rather than choice). Although both men and women, the normal ones anyway, are repulsed by the violence of real rape, the popularity of Burgess's novel rests upon its readers' fascination with fantasy rape. A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is little more than a glorification of violent rape.    In Burgess's Playboy interview, shortly after Kubrik's movie came out, he stated that his wife had been violently gang-raped and left physically crippled. Apparently this was the event that triggered the writing of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. Burgess emphasized that such violence is an act of free will, which is his religious conviction as a Catholic. This was also the conviction of Alex, the narrator of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. Alex scoffs as he listens to a media report that tries to blame youthful violence on the deteriorated moral values of the city, saying it would make just as much sense to blame the more prevalent human kindness on the conditions of the city. This is the free will doctrine, that evil is always entirely personal choice completely irrespective of one's culture. This is a very odd idea that is negated by even the simplest consideration of evidence. It is simply an observation that violent cultures produce more people who are prone to violence than nonviolent ones. After breaking into a couple's home, gang-raping a woman and beating her husband half to death, Alex and his droogs indulge in a rampage of destruction because they are full of, like, hate. So Alex presumably believes that he freely chose to be full of hate, and that other people choose to feel love, and it is entirely up to each individual to choose whichever way one likes. This might well be, but being the sort of person who likes to be full of hate is not a free will choice. People who routinely engage in violence because they have been nourished on violence, and not because they are violent by nature, sometimes reform when their empathy for their victims finally wins through. Alex narrates acts of disgusting brutality with such relish that he seems to be evil by nature, a psychopath completely lacking any sense of empathy.    As the story goes, Alex is arrested and by a combination of drugs and Pavlovian conditioning, his violent nature is forcibly reformed, so that even daydreaming about rape makes him violently ill. Of course, he has not really reformed because he still wants to be evil. He is still full of the juices of life but has been reduced to an automaton a clockwork orange. The prison chaplain opposes this treatment on the grounds that a person who chooses brutality freely is somehow more moral than a person who wants to be brutal but cannot because his free will has been taken from him. Apparently the movie audiences agreed; when Alex's treatment is reversed and he gets his free will back so he is once again capable of brutal rape, people cheered, and not merely the men. At the very least, if it were possible to artificially condition a human to non-violence, it is certainly just as possible that one could be naturally conditioned to violence by haphazard cultural conditioning.  It is certainly grotesque that Burgess's response to an attack on his wife was to write a novel glorifying violence. That was not his intention, though it is hard to ascertain just what his intention was. I get the impression that he wanted to mock the modern tendency to accredit violence to cultural conditioning rather than free will. If this is the case, he does not succeed. At the very least, if it were possible to artificially condition a human to non-violence, it is certainly just as possible that one could be naturally conditioned to violence by haphazard cultural conditioning. The behaviorist school of psychology denies a human has any nature except that which has been conditioned by the interplay of one's genes and the circumstances one's life, hence free will is a mere delusion. However, we can believe in man's capacity for free will and still recognize that few people have developed this capacity to any significant extent. Few people have sufficient insight to question the familial and cultural-conditional that has shaped them. We are even discouraged from such questioning on the grounds that it amounts to disloyalty to our family, religion, and country. An analogy that I sometimes use is that everyone has the capacity to do calculus, but few people develop the actual ability. The difference is that people who do not know how to do calculus know that they cannot do calculus; nearly everyone takes it for granted even hysterically so, as Alex does - that they act according to their own will.    The novel is in no way realistic, and that was apparently Burgess's intent. It is replete with the sort of wildly improbable coincidences that were standard in nineteenth century literature. Though this is a convention that I do not appreciate, it is not necessarily a flaw. What is a flaw is that Alex is not a believable character. The last chapter, in which Alex reforms, was omitted from the American version of the book that I read in 1967, as it was from the movie. I gather that Burgess feels that including this chapter in which Alex reforms somehow redeems his novel from being a mere glorification of violence. Alex was fifteen when he went into prison for murder, and he is eighteen when he reforms. Though he does observe that young people are like wind-up toys who behave as they do without thinking, which suggests that he now believes that his violence was conditioned rather than willed, he experiences no epiphany of insight. Alex experiences no remorse, no urge to atone for the pain that he has caused; he simply grows out of his violence and starts carrying pictures of babies around with him. Even if this had happened at the age of fifty it would not be convincing.
B001AVCFK6|1.0|It is my opinion that this is hands down, the worst trash I have every viewed in my life.     It appears the current owners of this series have casually decided that the star trek franchise was somehow inadequate.     In an instant the entire series has been rewritten, and for what; the sake of profits and commerce?     The haphazard way in which the characters are throw together absolutely disgusts and sickens me.     Clearly no thought has been given to the foundations of this franchise.     To me, there is no more vivid example of greed and capitalism run amok; than this \\"film\\".    I will never buy another star trek item of any type for so long as I live, nor will I go to see any future star trek anything.    Something wondrous has been taken and turned it into a mere product exactly like all the other action/adventure garbage clogging up the theaters these days.    I encourage everyone who reads this review to boycott this movie and anything to do with this franchise.

1932907009|5.0|As I'm sure it is with most people, once you pick up a good book and you start reading, you can't stop until you finish it. It's how it happened with \\"Save the Cat.\\" It is without a doubt one of the most interesting books about film-making I have read.    As a budding film-maker myself, as I was planning to write a feature-length script I've decided to buy this book first after reading a few reviews. Thought to myself it can't hurt. Boy was it a great decision. Blake Snyder's methods of planning and arranging your ideas beforehand are brilliant. I used to just open Final Draft and start typing, but now I'm actually something I never thought I'd be... Organized.    But that's just one thing he teaches you. The most important part of this book, in my opinion, is the innovative way the late Mr. Snyder labels film genres and the methods he teaches on how to find out where your story fits and what skeleton it should have. I can't really explain it, just read it. If you're planning on writing a script this book will be your best friend, trust me.     I could go into it more but it's pointless. I wanted this to be as short and as concise as possible, just get the book if you're serious about writing a movie. And if you have doubts about your story or flaws you can't seem to fix, this book offers a few great solutions to those as well.     After this book, its sequel is a must. It's a continuation of his work, with real examples of big movies that fall into those categories. Buy yourself some time and buy both. I did and after I finished the first one I jumped straight to the second one. They go hand in hand.
B002N3GD2Q|5.0|I just finished listening to this 6 cd box set. It's a collection of the Doors 4 performances recorded at New York's Felt Forum on January 17/18, 1970.  All I can say is I've been really impressed by the quality of the packaging, the sound, as well as the bands performances!  These concerts were expertly recorded!  Very clear and atmospheric recordings. The Doors performances were great and often inspired! Jim's voice gave out a little in the final show, but he made up for it with his energy and enthusiasm!  Jim was really into these shows and performed very well.<br /><br />  Some may notice that small parts of the song introductions as well as a few sections of songs themselves have been spliced in from other performances on the rare occasion.  However, this is very very minor.  The vast majority of the original Felt Forum tapes are included here.  The problem was since these shows were originally recorded, the tapes had been cut into many fragments for usage in various live releases through the years. From my understanding, Bruce Botnick basically had to assemble the tapes as if they were a jigsaw puzzle.  A few very small tape fragments are unfortunately lost forever.  With this taken into consideration, I think Mr. Botnick did a great job!  The other options were to either a) release what they had with the missing pieces, or b) fill in the missing gaps with lesser sound quality audience recordings.  Mr. Botnick chose to keep the flow of the concerts going without a drop in sound quality.  I'm fine with his decision all things considered.<br /><br />  Another decision Bruce Botnick had to make was regarding John Sebastion's harmonica playing on the January 18th late show. The problem was that his harmonica wasn't miced and thus not picked up on the original recordings. The solution was to have Mr. Sebastion overdub his harmonica playing.  I've read those particular songs will be released via download without Sebastion's overdubs.  Keeps all sides happy I think.<br /><br />  In conclusion, I'm very happy with this release and highly recommend it to fans of the group!  I also encourage them to BUY it.  This is the last release from the 'Absolutely Live' concert recordings.  Hopefully if this release is supported well and they make a little profit, it could encourage them to seek out rare recordings for future release via download or cd (I'd love Avalon Ballroom 1967 personally).  Can't wait for the Matrix master tapes!<br /><br />Thanks for reading!In conclusion, I'm very happy with this release and highly recommend it to fans of the group!  I also encourage them to BUY it.

You probably don't need much training for that. You just say everything with a straight face and talk in one, flat monotone. Nonetheless, Zachary Quinto was very convincing as Spock.     I took issue with Kirk. I found him to way too arrogant to sympathize with. At times I wanted him to get his but kicked, which I don't think is the direction in which the directors wanted my emotions to go. Surely, they wanted us rooting for Kirk, not against him. But when I saw him as a kid, running from police, I wanted to strangle him and knock some sense into him. As he grows up, he doesn't change much.     The fact that Kirk was wild, rebellious, often acting without thinking first, made me just livid. But he has heart and courage.     Loved the diversity. So often in Science Fiction/Fantasy movies there is a lack of diversity. Even Harry Potter had a few Asians and blacks.     I'm always put off by Science Fiction/Fantasy movies that take place in these mythical worlds where writers can conjure up flying pigs, disappearing witches and elves who glitter at night, but we might be hard pressed to find a Asian, Black or Hispanic in the cast of all-white, non-alien actors.     I applaud Star Trek for the diversity, and I applaud them for putting Chekov in, WITH HIS ACCENT.     The movie is great!
B00005RHGL|5.0|[[ASIN:B00005RHGL Tombstone - The Director's Cut (Vista Series)]] This movie was a new movie. It played like same.  The shipping time was short as usuall.   This is one of my favorite movies.  Kurt Russell's role as Wyatt Earp was great, ( he even looked like him) as a whole, however I didn't like the way he portrayed Waytt as a namby pamby before the gun fight at the ok coral.  From what I have read the real Wyatt Earp was not that way. Val Kilmer's portrayal of Doc Holiday was right on, and he should have gotten the Oscar for that.
B000HKWCOA|5.0|Enterprise is great in terms of genuine science fiction.  By that I mean that the first 2 and 4rth seasons are committed to novelty, genuinely new ideas about what if.  This is in contrast to the pure-militarism science fiction, which isn't really clever, just explosions.    Moreover, the history of the Federation is told; if you are a trekkie, then you will want to know this series to know how Vulcans changed to become what we know them in TOS, how and why the Romulans always assailed the Klingon/Federation alliance in TNG, who is in the Federation and why, where did all of the technologies come from...and perhaps most importantly, it's fascinating to look at a time when there is no big tough Federation to defend Earth.  Earth is a minor player, low tech...ironically, it's the Vulcans who are the tough, rough guys who get things done!    I consider it the 2nd best Star Trek.

B001KVZ6G6|5.0|There is probably no name I trust more today in film and television than Pixar (with the exception of Mutant Enemy).  Both the quality of their productions and the excellence of their scripts stand out among animated films.  I particularly loved this one because it shatters all previous templates for what a film is supposed to be about.  The main protagonist is a 78-year-old man who bears a resemblance to to Spencer Tracy and his main traveling companion is a young, rotund Asian boy scout.  Along the way they acquire a delightfully absurd and gigantic bird and a talking dog (while I saw this film I was reading Clifford D. Simak's CITY, which features several talking dogs, so for a while talking dogs were a motif in my cultural life).  All of this while attempting to relocate a house carried by thousands of helium-filled balloons to a mythical spot in South America called Paradise Falls.  And the entire affair was prefaced by a story within the story, of the story of Carl and Ellie's long life together.<br /><br />I've yet to see a Pixar movie that wasn't a complete delight.  And as for the appropriateness for small children, I would not hesitate to show it to one.  I think a child will find it entertaining, moving, and inspiring.  The messages in the film are good, positive ones and I not only think that children can see this film without harm, but should be encouraged to do so.
1401323820|4.0|[...] I received the book several weeks ago and it was a quick read both in content and  number of pages. I think my favorite part of reading the book was the ability to picture all the scenes of the police department and the people.  The characters had different names, and a view from Castle, aka Jameson Rook, in the story.  Plot was similar and followed the same routine as the show.   I guess I bought the book to see how the show's writers would handle the book. They kept the book as a \\"real\\" story, written by Castle, without any slip-ups that I could find.  If you like the TV program, the humor and wit between characters is in the book, and we even get a two page love scene between Nikki Heat and Rook.    I enjoyed the book almost as much as the TV show.

0307269981|1.0|Let me get straight to the point.  It is unlikely many readers will pick this up without having read THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, the first book in this trilogy by Stieg Larsson.  (If you are one such person, put this book down and pick up TGWTDT first.)  How does this book compare to its predecessor?<br /><br />Not very well, I am afraid.<br /><br />The bare plot involving a triple murder, an illegal sex ring and main character Lisbeth Salander's mysteriously alluded to background, could have been woven into an intriguing thriller.  But it is almost impenetrably bogged down with so many unnecessary characters that the plot gets buried underneath the act of simply trying to keep one's scorecard straight.<br /><br />Alas, that is not the locus of THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE's main troubles.  More problematic is that I have never read a book more filled with clear contempt, hostility and antipathy towards men in my life.  It is so over the top as to be almost beyond description.<br /><br />Oh, but did I not mention an illegal sex trade above?  What was the author to do?  Make them look like Boy Scouts?  But the problem is far more widespread than this.  Even male characters that have nothing to do with the sex trade are just scumbags to the core.  Certain male characters are introduced, it would seem, for no other purpose than to portray men poorly.  It would be difficult to overstate the extremity of this literary drive-by.<br /><br />Indeed, with the exception of Mikael Blomkvist, almost every male character is not merely defective, but extremely so.  Typical for this mentality, when a female character hates men, it is always due to some external reason that portrays them sympathetically, such as past abuse by a man.  But when male characters hate women, it is because . . . well, just because.  It is ontological in nature (see, [[ASIN:0773530991 Spreading Misandry: The Teaching of Contempt for Men in Popular Culture]] for a good analysis of this phenomenon in pop culture).<br /><br />Even more telling of the author's contempt for other men can be seen in his portrayal of those few men who might actually be referred to as the 'good guys.'  All are either laughably ineffective and, in a literary version of a feminist wish fulfillment, need women to physically protect them (in a particularly illuminating example, a world class boxer is saved from getting beaten to death in a physical fight by a woman with broken ribs, a broken nose and other serious bodily harm, who is able to knock the big, bad man out to save the good guy's life) or instead are merely pathetic (Erika Berger's husband, who jovially wishes his wife a good time when she explicitly tells him, as she often does, that she will not be coming home that night and instead will be sharing the bed of another man).<br /><br />Not surprisingly for anyone familiar with the mindset of those males `enlightened' about the oppression of women, the book is filled with women kicking the groins of, shooting, and generally committing other acts of violence against men.  But hey?  The men are all scumbags, aren't they?  They deserve it.<br /><br />Independent of the above, this book is weak for another reason.  Larsson has made Lisbeth Salander simply too ridiculous to take seriously.  In the first book, Larsson gave Salander a photographic memory, a trait that makes her truly an act of fiction given that this does not exist in non-mentally handicapped adults.  Here, we learn of Salander's other intellectual gifts, ones that are so preposterous that I have no choice but to use the word `ridiculous' once again, in order to describe them properly.<br /><br />Stieg Larsson, like every male feminist I have ever encountered (and I know he explicitly considered himself to be one), no doubt thought of himself as enlightened.  And, again like every male feminist I have encountered, believed it his role to enlighten the rest of us, especially us other men.  In fact, Larsson does nothingto illuminate any issues about violence against women, but does a wonderful job instead of illuminating the degree to which some men have serious problems with their own masculinity.  His attempt to bludgeon us with an ideological agenda has turned what could have been a very good book into a hunk of junk.nderful job instead of illuminating the degree to which some men have serious problems with their own masculinity.  His attempt to bludgeon us with an ideological agenda has turned what could have been a very good book into a hunk of junk.
B000002VC3|4.0|In June of 1982, The Alan Parsons Project released their sixth, and what by some measures is their most successful album \\"Eye in the Sky\\".  The album is very diverse in sound and has several pieces which are noteworthy from the groups catalogue of songs.  Also notable is the album cover which features the Wedjat (Wadjet) symbol, also known as the Eye Horus or the Eye of Ra.  Alan Parsons has claimed that the symbol has become synonymous with his identity after it appeared on the cover.  The cover was created by Storm Thorgerson of Hipgnosis.<br /><br />\\"Sirius\\" is the piece which opens the album, and it is an easy recognizable instrumental, which has often been used by sports franchises for their introductions, most notably with the Chicago Bulls during the Michael Jordan era.  The short piece leads right into the group's biggest hit of all time, the title piece \\"Eye in the Sky\\" with Eric Woolfson singing.  \\"Children of the Moon\\" is another very good piece with David Paton handling the vocals.  \\"Gemini\\" has haunting vocals by Chris Rainbow and a beautiful chorus section.  \\"Silence and I\\" closes out the first half of the album with another vocal from Eric Woolfson.  It is the longest piece on the album, and has tremendous diversity with an orchestrated section between the two vocal sections.<br /><br />The second half of the album doesn't work as well for me.  It opens with \\"You're Gonna Get Your Fingers Burned\\", a decent but unexceptional song with Lenny Zakatek handling the vocals.  \\"Psychobabble\\" is one of those songs which some people really like, but I am not one of them. Once again I would say it is decent, and it is memorable, with good vocals from Elmer Gantry, but for me it doesn't hold up to repeated listening.  \\"Mammagamma\\" is a nice instrumental, but not as distinctive as \\"Sirius\\" which opens the album.  Alan Parson's indicates on his website that \\"Step By Step\\" with vocals by Lenny Zakatek, is his least favorite of the Project's songs.  In contrast, \\"Oldand Wise\\" with vocals by Colin Blunstone is one of the best songs on the album, and helps improve the overall rating of the album with a strong finish.<br /><br />For the most part, The Alan Parsons Project is Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson who wanted to create their own music rather than have to deal with the artists who they manage and produce.  The group tended to use several different vocalists, and this album is no exception.  The other performers on this album have, for the most part, also been involved from time to time with the group.  The vocalists on this album include David Paton, Chris Rainbow, Lenny Zakatek and Colin Blunstone in addition to Eric Woolfson, all of which could be considered regulars of a sort with the group.  In addition, Elmer Gantry has a vocal on this album after also having one on the \\"Turn of a Friendly Card\\" album.<br /><br />In addition to the keyboards played by Eric Woolfson and Alan Parsons, there is David Paton playing bass, Stuart Elliot on drums and percussion, Ian Bairnson on acoustic and electric guitar.  All of which have been frequent contributors to the group, and Mel Collins playing saxophone who also played on the \\"Ammonia Avenue\\" album.  The Alan Parsons Project always delivers something interesting to listen to, and \\"Eye in the Sky\\" is one of their better albums.

And I had it figured out about mid-way through; so much for suspense.  How many lone lunatics are there running around in Mr. Brown's world anyway?  And another peeve: after the first 20 pages or so we know who the characters are.  He doesn't have to keep giving their full names every time he mentions them:  Robert Langdon said this, Peter Solomon did that.  There's only one Robert, one Peter, one Katherine.  We should be on a first name basis by the end of the book.  Even if they don't have much personality.  Just an example of an irritating style.

B002P7UCMC|5.0|RAMMSTEIN returns with another superb album that delivers everything you'd expect and more. I have enjoyed all of their previous albums and this one is no exception- the songs, the melodies, the singing, the energy, the guitar and synth work---all just keep delivering beyond expectations.    If you are a RAMMSTEIN fan, this album should definitely make you very happy, it's a more of a return to their more aggressive roots but there's also a couple of really nice ballads in there as well. Till's vocals are better than ever, presented in an ever-expanding range of emotion this time around, even though he's always spectacular in the deep, angry range he is famous for.    There's really not enough good I can say about this album, every song delivers! And I sure don't understand the disappointment from so many regarding their first single off this recording- Rammstein is known for their dark sense of humor with songs like 'America' and 'Te Quiero Puta' on previous albums- not to mention the insane 'Buck Diche' from their most successful album, SEHNSUCHT. So like Til says in this classic 'pink' song gone insane---'what's the problem?' Lighten up people, it's a satire and while the lyrics are deliberately superficial and corny, the music itself is very cool, as always.     Do not miss this album, and I highly recommend the double-CD version, as the songs on CD # 2 are no leftovers, but very strong Rammstein tunes that you will enjoy immensely!

B0018CWWLE|5.0|This DVD is one of the best music DVDs ever ! The sound is amazing ! A must.    -Patrick.
B002QEXN2K|4.0|One of the reasons I like John Mayer is that he's open and honest about what's going on in his life. Sometimes it's too much information, sometimes it's awkward and sometimes it's just right; but at the end of the day, it's him.     Recently, he's become a tabloid feature and it seems as though his personal life has taken more of a presence than what brought him fame in the first place: his music. I guess he tried to fix that by taking his fans along in his journey creating 'Battle Studies' and while I think it's a bold and much-appreciated move (how often does one get to `see' a record come together through the artist's eyes, from scribbles to snippets to a finished product?)  he might have shot himself in the foot in doing so.      Following 'Continuum' must have put a lot of pressure on him and having millions of people track  - and offer opinions  on - his progress on Battle Studies just added to the pressure to produce something \\"good\\". The main question if he lived up to the high expectations people had and my answer is that people should listen to this without expectations, without looking for a second `Continuum' and without listening to see what tracks hint at his celebrity persona, because - away from all the hype, as a stand alone piece - it is a great album.     'Battle Studies' is a deeply personal collection of songs and each is beautifully written. Clichéd, perhaps, but honest and emotional. I don't think he's trying to hard to be something he's not. The best song for me is \\"Assassin\\" - I love the haunting melody and the `diary of a bad boy' lyrics.     So, this album doesn't have the funk 'Continuum' has and it doesn't sound much like 'Room for Squares' or 'Heavier Things.' It's a little different but it's melodic and peaceful, and hints that these songs could rock hard in live versions and knowing Mayer, it's just a matter of time before a live album is released.

B001FB55HQ|2.0|I saw Terminator: Salvation in theaters and I was extremely disappointed in how the origional story line that James Cameron created, went right down the toilet.    Here are the major issues I have with this movie:      1. In Terminator 2 and even Terminator: The Sarah Conner Chronicles, Sarah ALWAYS told John to run when he saw a machine. He is too important for the future. What do they have John doing in this movie? They have him on the front lines hunting the machines.    2. Who is the leader of the human resistance? John Conner. Why is he reporting to superiors and taking orders from them? Who fricking knows. John should be giving orders, not taking them and having others report to him.    3. Who is John's father? Kyle Reese. Do the machines know who John's father is? According to the first film, NO. All records were destroyed during the nuclear war, the machines had no clue who Conner's father was, but yet somehow Reese's name ends on the top of a list that the machines are targeting for termination. Then the machines find Reese, but don't terminate him. WTF? If the machines aquired their target, they would have terminated him ASAP, they would not have taken him to the work/slave farm.    4. For those that have see Terminator 3, towards the end John asks the T-800 (Arnold) why he wasn't alive in the future and that his wife sent the T-800 back. The responce was: because of the emotional connection John had with the T-800 model when he was younger (Terminator 2) he infiltrated his base and killed John. Now in Terminator: Salvation John faces the new T-800 model, with a digitally imposed Arnold body. Does John die? No, he lives, but the laws of physics are completely shattered during the fight. John shoots a hole in a basin that has melted metal in it. It's pretty much molten lava. It spills on the T-800 and completely covers it, but the T-800 survives and contines coming after John. Wait a minute, didn't a T-800 and the T-1000 get destroyed in melted metal at theend of Terminator 2? Major screw up there if you ask me. Anyway, back to T4, the T-800 is after John, so he shoots a pipe, it bursts and splaches liquid nitrogen on it. The T-800 is frozen, but not defeated, because it breaks free and continues after Conner. Ok, so let me get this straight, the T-800 is covered in molten lava then frozen very quickly after and it can still move? Highly unlikely. If you know anything about going from extreme heat to extreme cold, especially with metal, it explands, then contracts and becomes brittle. So the T-800 would have been stuck because the joints would not have been able to move and Conner would have had an easy victory by beating the head and destroying the chip.    There are to many continuity issues from the origional James Cameron films that just don't follow into this forth installment. As far as I'm concerned, this forth film doesn't belong in the story line. If they continue with the series, they need to fix the errors they made otherwise, they will just ruin it for me.

B002HWRYJE|4.0|I'm not exactly sure what the negative reviews of this film are all about, as I can only comment from my own experience and history with Star Trek.<br /><br />First of all, I enjoyed the original series for what it was, way back in the 1960's, when I was about 12 years old.  And I know I always enjoyed the reruns of the original series that I caught as an adult, despite my dislike of William Shatner, who I've always thought of as a pretty bad actor.  But Mr. Spock was cool, and I always thought the basic concept and philosophy of the show was way cool.<br /><br />I never really enjoyed the earlier Star Trek films, except the Wrath of Khan, and I never got into the \\"Trekkie\\" mindset or the subsequent \\"Next Generation\\" shows, etc.  To me, Star Trek was a fun TV show I liked as a kid, and enjoyed in reruns when I caught it; I never gave it much more thought than that.<br /><br />When I heard they'd made a film based on the original series, I thought it sounded interesting, and when I'd heard some good reviews, I figured I'd check it out.  I went to see it in the movies, something I don't do too much of these days; I usually just wait for the DVD, since I collect movies at home.  But I had a feeling I'd enjoy the film, so I went, and now I own it on DVD.  As a result, I've seen it twice.<br /><br />What I found was a film that was just as much fun as I'd expected.  What made it, for me, was the ingenious casting.  Each of the young characters look, sound and act like the characters I remember from the original show (except for Kirk, who resembles William Shatner not at all, and I don't really think that's a bad thing).  Young Spock, Bones, Sulu, Chekov, Uhura and Scott are all dead on.  The story was fun, the action never stopped and the bad guy was formidable, so I'm not really sure how much more fans could expect.  Of course, as I said, I never was a big Trek fanatic to begin with; if I was as compulsively obsessed as some seem to be with the story line and the \\"time continuum\\" and I'm not sure of the significance of that, to be sure, well, I might be upset too.<br /><br />As it was, I thought it was a pleasant diversion and a good prequel to a TV show I remember fondly.  If you are looking for something that will prop up the continuing saga of Star Trek, the Next Generation, Star Trek Voyager or Deep Space Nine, you may very well want to skip it, because if you're that into the franchise, you will be disappointed.  But for people like me, who were casually amused by the original series, it fills the bill as entertainment.

0307473708|4.0|All in all, this is a decent read. I feel that I do not need to go into a summation of the plot since many of our colleagues have adequately summed it up already. I will do my best not to give anything away. I will also add that, having not seen the series, this will be purely a review of the written material.<br /><br />First, I will mention some of the issues that I had with this novel.<br />Nothing in it really jumped out and surprised me in the book, accept it did have a very interesting twist at the end which, I must admit, seemed a bit too clich&eacute;. Dexters internal monologues were also very repetitive, continuously reminding us how he isn't human and has no emotions, yet he does exhibit emotions such as sadness and joy (however, this may be an allusion for things to come in later novels, but I'm not sure).<br />The continuous references to how tough the streets of Miami were and how heinous crimes were blaz&eacute;, and petty crimes a normal occurrence, was a bit annoying. This repetitive pattern of Dexter's internal monologues reminding you over and over again that he isn't 'human' that never seemed to go anywhere different and the author continuously reminding you that Miami is a tough city with crazy drivers (as if he believe that you didn't get the idea in the first 150 pages), just ran on too much. It seems as if Lindsay was padding the book to make it longer.<br />I should also mention that LaGuerta and Deborah are extremely annoying. Deborah was the most in the beginning because all she did was whine and complain, and was always running to Dexter for help instead of thinking for herself.<br />That being said, I can go into what I enjoyed about it.<br /><br />Dexter is an interesting character, and seems to be rather unique in the world of Crime thrillers. A serial killer who only kills people who deserve it, a very interesting twist on things. He has no righteous ambition, no want to save the world or rid it of crime (although he does have a soft spot for children, and a particular disdain for people who go after children). He merely kills for his own pleasure, but only kills those who 'deserve to be killed'. People who are guilty of heinous crimes and have surpassed the justice system.<br />I also enjoyed the character of Doakes, and I hope to see his character expanded upon.<br /><br />I am only giving this book 4/5 because it didn't impress me too much and was a bit too predictable and clich&eacute; riddled. However, I could tell that there was something there that Lindsay didn't quite grasp, but was within reach. Lindsay is a good writer, although some of the expressions he had Dexter saying were completely out of character (He made a comparison of something with opossum farts, if I'm not mistaken), but then again maybe he was meant to break his suave character with something crude.<br /><br />It's a pretty quick read, and it was able to keep my attention. It's not a masterpiece, but a good way to kill a boring Saturday afternoon (pardon the pun), and I think I'll read the next novel to see how he develops that already devious character who, despite his own denial of it, does have the hints of a human side.<br /><br />Overall Review: It's a good book to read for crime enthusiasts, but wasn't as psychological as I had hoped it would be, however it was still interesting and good to read. I was actually going to give the book 3/5, but I had to give it an extra star for originality and such a fascinating protagonist like Dexter.for people who go after children).

B002BSHXJA|4.0|-What a few reviewers here are ignorant of is the reason why EMI, Apple and Capitol Records/USA decided remastering the mono versions of the Beatles work in the first place.    You need to know something about the recording process to begin with.  Contrary to popular belief, most mono mixes are NOT simple fold downs of the stereo mixes.  The mono mixes and stereo mixes of a given recording are usually totally separate mixes!     In the 1960s days ([prior to 1969) the preferred mixes produced were always the mono mixes. There was a tremendous amount of work in producing the mono, since the  rationale was that relatively few young and/or \\"teen people\\" actually owned or had open access to good home stereo Hi-Fi equipment in those days. Also a large consideration was taken into account that these Beatles songs would mostly be heard through a car's small radio speaker on AM radio and had to sound good on it. -In the States, the first stereo version of a Beatles' L.P. that sold in significant volume was in late 1965 with \\"Rubber Soul.\\" (even so, stereo L.P. sales were comparatively quite anemic in \\"backward Britain\\" vs. USA or Germany with the exception of classical music).    -In the Beatles case this point is quite significant. Once the mono mixes were complete, only then would the separate stereo be made with the EQ being at different settings. The stereo was usually done quite rapidly verses the much longer time spent mixing and lavishing the mono.     For example, the entire time spent doing the original stereo mixes on \\"Beatles For Sale\\" was sometimes less then 30 minutes per track, verses sometimes hours per track on the mono.    The stereo was considered \\"frivolous\\" and done almost as if a second thought. The Beatles themselves never even heard the stereo mixes of their own work until the original L.P.s were commercially released!    There are things noticeably different on the various mono mixes. Sometimes the edit pieces for the solos are from different takes. Sometimes George Martin's piano is at a much lower volume levels on the mono and the guitars stand out more.    The Abbey Road engineers will tell you that the only \\"true version\\" of Sgt. Pepper is the mono one. there are more effects, etc. on the mono one plus the EQ for it is different then the stereo version. But, then again the catchy novelty of \\"panning vocals\\" was introduced on the SPLHCB stereo version. George Harrison himself told it on the Beatles Anthology project that he never liked the stereo versions of their work and thought the whole \\"directional sound\\" thing was a gimmick and wrecked their sound!   Word of this has gotten around globally over the years and hence the pent up demand for a Beatles mono CD product in a stereo world.
B0002234LS|3.0|Secret Window: 5 out of 10: I am not going to critique Johnny Depp. He is fine in this movie. And I certainly do not want the great wrath of woman, of various ages, down upon my head. Johnny Depp is a thespian God. He can do no wrong. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory never existed... (God he was awful in that.)    Depps performance is the most entertaining thing is Secret Window. In fact with the exception of a wonderfully drawn Timothy Hutton in a supporting role, it is the only entertaining thing in the movie. The small cast is rounded out by Maria Bello (A 41 year old butterface that plays Depps, cuckolding, bitchy, soon to be ex-wife) and the usually dependable John Turturro who is a disaster.    This is a Stephen King adaption about a writer going over the edge. (If you saw The Dark Half which also starred Timothy Hutton this will definitely feel like familiar ground). The plot is a familiar train wreck. Depp is a writer going through a nasty divorce and suffering from writers block. There is a knock at the door and Turturro is at the door. With a southern drawl and an Amish tailor Turturro claims that Depp stole his story and has to make it right.    Ah plagiarism, that old plot twist standby which many a great horror novel is based on. (Or maybe not). Turtorros character quickly becomes a nasty bit of work as he kills Depps beloved dog with a screwdriver. (This isnt really a plot spoiler. This is a Steven King adaptation, there are no kids in it to kill and the beloved dog might as well have been dressed in a metaphorical red shirt from the first scene.)    This is where the movie officially lost me. Turturro is about as threatening as a Joe Pesci romantic comedy and if his character (named Shooter) killed one of my family members the next time he entered my property he would be renamed shot.    But the movie cannot let Depp kill Shooter... cause of a super secret plot twist so lame and so obvious that its no wonder plagiarism was at the forefront of the writers mind. To add insult to injury the movie actually feels it needs to drop hints at this shocking plot twist apparently under the assumption a portion of the audience sniffs glue for a living and didnt figure it out within 10 minutes of the opening credits.    The only real surprise in the entire film is the strange Children of the Corn references (Turtorros character seems to be clearly channeling Malachi and the last scene is torn right from that mid-eighties classic.)    Perhaps the film is meant to be homage to the fine Children of the Corn series... No greater faint praise could I imagine damning with.
B00005R8FI|5.0|This recording is timeless. It sounds as fresh today as it did 40 years ago.  Mayall never sold himself short. He kept moving and if you wanted to make the   trip, you could come too. A piece of magic was captured that July night in NYC.
B001KZVQJI|5.0|King Kong: 8 out of 10: Peter Jackson's Kong is a long love letter to the original movie that surprisingly turns into that rarest of crowd pleasers. A movie that both men and their gals will like. Like Titanic, Kong has enough action to keep boys of all ages happy and a romance (complete with tragic ending) to get the ladies crying.    And what a romance. Kong and Naomi Watts light up the screen with that most famous of dysfunctional cross species parings. And while you may be mumbling Stockholm Syndrome at the beginning (Not to mention whiplash, jeez Jackson turn down the rag doll physics on the Naomi Watts CGI effect. The way Kong flings her around she should end the film in a body cast) the romance seems to win even the cynics (yours truly) at the end.    The rest of the cast is also top notch with Jack Black playing an Orson Wells style director so well it is almost freighting. Speaking of frightening many people wondered aloud how Jackson would handle the racist caricature (by today standards) of the island natives especially considering the whole disturbing white wizard versus the \\"dark forces\\" subtext of the LOTR films. Not to worry the embarrassing stereotypes of happy dancing black people are mocked in the Kong stage show putting that embarrassing Hollywood episode to rest.    Instead the residents of Skull Island are some of the scariest people ever put on film. Pushing the PG-13 rating to the limit they put the can back in cannibal. Its nice to see natives bashing skulls, going into voodoo trances and kidnapping white woman they invoke the much happier stereotype of the true island savage. Hell they are scarier than the ape.    Possible racial insensitivity aside Kong is far from perfect. While the special effects are overall top notch there are seams. For example when people run with the dinosaurs the limit of the green screen seems to show through (And could we get a moratorium on velociraptors in movies. They are really getting cliché and being a relatively new paleontological find really don't fit in a thirties era Kong movie. Yes I know that isn't logical but they kind of seem modern as if a character had a cell phone).    The other real problem is length. This feels like the directors cut. With an easy 30 minutes of film that could (and probably should) end up on the cutting room floor. We spend so much time in various Kong free Broadway theaters one might mistake this for a Yankee Doodle Dandy remake. All that said great action scary islanders and tragic romance make King Kong a winner.
031606792X|1.0|The first two reviews summed it up for me.  Truly terrible and disappointing.  But something good did come from reading this book - it killed my Twilight buzz and I'm no longer unhealthily obsessed with the series.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|First of all, Let's talk \\"packaging\\". If you want to save some money...Amazon.com $13.99 (U.S) ~ But ! If you want the \\"Ultimate Package\\" It's a Best Buy \\"Exclusive\\" and it is just AWESOME ! $19.99 (U.S.) and well worth it ! It's in a hard bound book form. Beautiful big full color pictures and a Paul McCartney Baseball Card !!!    Well, (In my opinion) I have everything Paul has done. So, I have a \\"little\\" investment in Mr. McCartney...this is his finest Live work I have (ever) heard ! Clean Sound,Production and very well put together (Both Audio and Video) His \\"set list\\" is different that the \\"usual\\" set list from his past efforts. On \\"Good Evening New York City\\" you are getting a fantastic mix of older tunes that he hasn't done in years. A lot of different versions to the \\"classic\\" songs (more relaxed and comfortable) Paul also \\"slips in\\" a little instrumental version of Jimmy Hendrix' \\"Foxy Lady\\" in between \\"Let me Roll It\\" and \\"Highway\\". Move over \\"Rover\\" and let \\"Pauly\\" take over ! Over all, Just wonderful ! The only thing that I was \\"disappointed\\" in was, he didn't do the wonderful song \\"Freedom\\" ! Come on Paul, the show was in New York City !!     ~ Rob
B002DYKP8S|2.0|I should say first that I own the DVD and not the Blu-ray. I was extremely disappointed to not see a high-res chinese audio track on the Blu-ray. I have a fairly high end audio system and when I first got it I would show it off with the Hero DVD. That disc had a chinese track in standard DTS and it sounded incredible, way better than the Dolby Digital track on the same disc. So I was really hoping for even better sound with the Blu-ray.<br /><br />This very stupid mistake would almost be forgivable if not for two things. 1: The chinese DTS track from the DVD is not on the Blu-ray either. STUPID! 2: The english dub does not feature Jet Li's voice and the emperor's voice is that of an actor I can easily reconize which makes it very distracting. They've also put more emphasis on matching lip movement rather than the emotion in the dialog.<br /><br />As I said have not bought this Blu-ray yet; although, I may cave in because while the DVD sounds great it does not look great on my HDtv. The worst part about all of this is that Buena Vista does not re-release live-action movies very often. So there's not much hope that they'll fix this stupid mistake for quite some time.
B0000CF30C|4.0|I bought this for one song and it delivered; there is a piano track I never heard before.  Big Aero fans will LOVE this!
0307341550|5.0|This book is written very well. It is like nothing I have ever read before.  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a great mystery!! Looking forward to reading more from this author.  Once you start this book you can't put it done. I finished it in 2 days.
B002QEXN2K|5.0|John Mayer has produced a fantastic CD of strong songs. He's one of the best pop songwriters we have right now. Listen close. Mood and sonic colors will take you on a wonderful journey, if you choose to let them. And you know what? He can make it come alive on stage. As a musician for many years it's so refreshing to see a performer who can really play. And man can this guy sing. Very soulful as in an old soul. Thanks Mr. Mayer
B000JIHP88|5.0|We just purchased this for our infant son and he loves it.  The figures point down so he can see them well.  The leaves flap which he also seems to like.  The music choices and rainforest sounds are quite nice.  We haven't used the remote control yet, but sure it will come in handy.  He's entertained the entire run time.  Definitely a good mobile.
B002QH2NUA|2.0|I'm a HUGE Paul fan. I have everything ever released commercially and not so commercially. I was very much looking forward to this album after hearing bootlegs of the real performance.    But holy cra*! who the heck used Autotune on the vocals???? This is terrible sounding. Sounds like a freakin' robot. Why would he choose to do this?    BY THE WAY- I'm suggesting that Autotune was used in post production, NOT at the live show. Meaning, they took the recorded tracks from the NY concert and ran them through pitch-correction software.    Listen to ANY of the 'so called' artists these days (madonna, cher, black eyed peas, and pretty much any emo band out there) and you can hear how much singing talent they DON'T have because they've autotuned their voices to death. Paul's vocal pitch at this show did hit a few flat spots (hey, it's live, it happens). They could've possibly tweaked those notes, or better yet, had him sing them over in the studio like most live albums do. But to use Autotune on McCartney??? Sacrilegious to say the least. Autotune can be used with it being less noticeable, but whoever produced this album obviously didn't have a clue on how to use it.    Disappointed to say the least. This will be the first McCartney album that I WON'T be purchasing.    For God Sake Paul- PLEASE do not use this on your future solo albums.  To all of those out there that want the real show, it IS available if you know where to look.     This is a sad day.
B002QEXN2K|1.0|Let me start by saying I am a big fan of John Mayer's work. I own all his albums, and enjoy them all.    This album can be summed up in one word.    Snore.    As in, that's what you'll be doing about 6 tracks in.
0307454541|5.0|My initial impression of this book was that it read like a long lost John Irving manuscript.  The depth and richness in the development of the Vanger family, Mikael Blomkvist, and Lisbeth Salander reminded me much of his style.  Salander, The girl with the dragon tattoo, is hands-down the hippest, edgiest, and simply coolest female character ever created by an author.  She trumps even Robbins' Sissy Handshaw in Cowgirls.  Salander is a side character who eventually enters into the primary story thread around the middle of the book.  So, don't be confused that the title character does not appear much until the middle of the book.  She's not the title character in the original Swedish edition which is called \\"Men Who Hate Women\\".<br /><br />The novel has several different stories masterfully layered together; each by itself would make for a solid novel and taken together they form a masterpiece.  There are very dark and disturbing themes, that is for sure.  And the book is a heady cerebral read, not for those craving an action packed quickly read story.  I did become so engaged in the story that I could not put it down and read the last 200 pages in one day.  It is difficult to describe the story without including spoilers; suffice it to repeat what is included on the back cover:  \\"...murder mystery, family saga, love story, and financial intrigue...a complex and atmospheric novel.\\"
0060935464|5.0|Just revisited this gem of a coming-of-age novel after about 20 years, and it's still every bit as striking as it was back then. 8 year-old Scout Finch will always stay as one of my favourite characters of all time as she witnesses the goings-on of Maycomb county where she is growing up in post-Depression Southern America.    Written almost 40 years ago, the issues about what makes a person human, what courage means, how bigotry and ignorance begets prejudice and becomes a threat to the individual, the family and society, are all still valid issues we're grappling with today.    Narrated through the innocent perspective of a child, the novel is so much more poignant for the unadulterated logic a child possesses and becomes a foil for the folly and terror of man's ways.     Saying any more than this about this timeless classic would only take time away from actually reading the novel. Please read it.

1416562605|2.0|For the desk of:  Lloyd Craig Blankfein   Goldman Sachs holding company,  Somewhere in Manhattan      Dear Mr. Blankfein ,  Allow me to introduce myself- I am Aravind Adiga, author of the Booker Prize winning \\"The white Tiger\\".  As the CEO of the profit making investment bank that survived the sub-prime downturn, I salute you ! You may not have heard of me, but you and I are alike, as shall be seen in this letter.     You see Mr. CEO, we both are in the same line of business essentially- in your case of taking cheap, unworthy credit and packaging it as a high end financial product, and in my case, doing a shallow study of the lives of the poor in India, and packaging it into a novel that sounds deep enough to fool the Booker crowd.    Mr. CEO, both you and I know that this is a game. My book shows little genuine empathy for the people I write about. I don't care about them really- only that the story should sell in the right market. So I take some news items of hit and run cases in the media,take the poverty of Bihar,everyday life in Delhi, and the hope of Bangalore and spin a story around it.    Who cares if my characters are so shallow ? Sometimes the dialog between Mr. Ashok and Pinky madam is so banal, I think even the Mumbai film scripts can do better. There is more depth in a Chekov short story than in this whole 319 page novel. Yes, even I know- the place where a man dies of a car accident is so poorly written to be credible.     We are not talking about depth, are we ? Its all about the packaging. Its all about publicity! Just like you sell your funds! I have reviewers  writing about it in the west. There are only two types of people in the world, Mr. CEO. The ones with fat wallets and the one's without. As long as the book appeals to the one with the fat wallets, and they think it is some exotic story of the \\"real India\\", I really don't care about the one's with the small wallets.     yours respectfully,  The White tiger  Some fancy apartment complex,  Mumbai
B000HT3PPG|5.0|This is the &#34;Miracle on 34th Street&#34; I remember from childhood. It is one of my favorite movies of all time and none of the remakes compare.<br /><br />The set includes both the black and white and colorized versions. The colorized version is the one shown on television, not something new and improved. The opening scene was grainy and the color was distorted, as if to remind us this is an old movie. The black and white version is crisp, as it was meant to be shown. Both versions offer the option to view the movie with the Maureen O'Hara commentary, which she does throughout the movie.<br /><br />I found O'Hara's commentary interesting. Sometimes, she just described what was happening in the scene, which we could see for ourselves. Other times, she would describe what it was like to work with an actor or what was happening behind that scene or on the set. That was a special treat and I sat glued to the set to watch the movie a second time just to hear her talk.<br /><br />&#34;AMC Backstory&#34; gave a history of the movie and some of the problems behind the set. I found it fascinating, but I did not like that it was cut into clips and run like on television with all the pauses put in for commercials, except we didn't see any commercials. Certainly those pauses could have been edited out.<br /><br />Also included are the Thanksgiving day parade footage, promotional shorts and the poster gallery.<br /><br />I was looking forward to the little booklets often inserted into DVD sets, but this set lacks one. Still, it is a wonderful set.

We also get contoured portraits of Dick Fuld and Joe Gregory and a sense of the frustration that saturated the Lehman workforce, particularly those who understood what was happening to the portfolio.
B001GCUNWQ|4.0|I loved the first Ice Age. The second was so-so.  This third one got me laughing the way the first one did.  Some of the jokes were recycled but there was some good new material, too.  If you pay attention, you'll notice some weird plot issues, esp. as relating to the previous movies (like, in the second one, wasn't everything melting?  Why is everything frozen again in the 3rd one?) but it I'm pretty forgiving to that sort of thing, so it didn't bother me.  If you liked the first Ice Age, I recommend the 3rd--even if you didn't like the 2nd.

B002BSHWUU|3.0|i caved in and decided to buy both sets as i am after all as a beatles fan.what gets me is the price of these sets.they dont come cheap!.i can see however why the mono sets are much more expensive.for a start they are made in japan where the quality is more pristine than the american sets.they even sound better than if they were made in uk/america...even the card sleeves etc are of a better quality.just one thing dissapoints me is i wish they would do an alternative version in a remixed stereo set as i still prefer alternative mixes to the original.songs like on ..submarine songbook sound awhole lot better than original mix.i still cant listen to stereo versions of paperback writer,slow down,long tall sally,flying etc..theres just no depth to these mixes.so until remix comes along its back to mono versions where appropriate.thats why i bought both so i can mix up all the  good versions on my playlist and be reasonably happy.i dont care if they were to use compression on songs like i want to hold your hand(love album-great!)as this does in fact give alot more oomph!!!more balls of bass etc..more depth of sound!lets do this before fans really do lose interest.i can see why older fans (such as myself even) still want to rekindle that memory associated with the origina mix but after getting overt that i still crave for alterenative versions....

B001W63DXC|5.0|Iron Maiden's latest release is the soundtrack to their concert documentary Flight 666 which came out in June, 2009 and is a must for all fains of Iron Maiden.<br />Some people complain about Iron Maiden releasing \\"yet another live album\\" in this last decade but it was in concert where Maiden's true colors are shown. Also some claim this is a bad re-do of Live After Death but this is not a re-make of that album. In fact, in Febuary 2008, Iron Maiden (which for the last decade consisted of Bruce Dickinson on vocals; guitarists Dave Murray, Adrian Smith and Janick Gers; bass player Steve Harris and drummer Nicko McBrain) began work on a documentary about the band Iron Maiden's most adventurous tour taken to date known as \\"The Somewhere Back in Time World Tour\\" which saw the group resurrect its stage set from 1984/85's World Slavery Tour and perform much of the tunes from that period (sans \\"Flight of Icarus\\", \\"Running Free\\" and \\"Sanctuary\\" and a few others) plus some tracks from Somewhere in Time, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son and Fear of the Dark. The documentary woud be called Flight 666 and released into theaters for one night only and released on DVD and blu-ray plus became a VH1 Classic staple. Its soundtrack was released as a 2 CD/3 LP set all have the recorded versions of the songs (plus 2) that made it into the movie.<br />We begin things with \\"Churchill's Speech\\" which segues into a killer performance of \\"Aces High\\" recorded in Mumbai, India. Bruce's vocals here trump either the original or the live version on 1985's Live After Death. Next is a stellar \\"Two Minutes to Midnight\\" recorded in Melbourne, Australia. A stellar version! Next is possibly the best version of \\"Revelations\\" ever recorded (only rivaled by the version on Live After Death). This came from the group's show in Sydney, Australia. Janick's take on Adrian's solo is not bad. Next is \\"The Trooper\\" recorded in Tokyo, Japan. Nicko's drumming is stellar and the triple guitar attack make this version my second favorite after Live in Rio. Next is a stellar live version of \\"Wasted Years\\" recorded in Monterrey, Mexico. This third official live recording of the tune makes its debut on an Iron Maiden live album (the first from 1988 was on the video Maiden England and the second was a flip side). Now a stellar version of \\"The Number of Beast\\" recorded at The L.A. Forum in Los Angeles, CA (where the first double live Maiden album Live After Death was mostly recorded at). Dickinson's voice I swear gets better as he gets older and the dual leads of Murray and Smith just kick *ss. Next is \\"Can I Play With Madness\\" recorded in Mexico City, Mexico. Out of the five live versions of this track I heard, this is tied with the version from the Maiden England 1988 concert film IMHO! We close the first CD with a stellar live version of my all time favorite Maiden epic \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" recorded ath the Izod Center in New Jersey. This version of this track is worth this CD and/or LP alone!<br />Disc two begins with the live version of \\"Powerslave\\" recorded in Alajuela, Costa Rica. This rivals the version recorded on Live After Death. Next is the best live version of \\"Heaven Can Wait\\" ever recorded from Sao Paulo, Brazil. Superb version of this classic track. Next is \\"Run to the Hills\\" recorded live in Bogota, Colombia. This version has to rank as one of the best live versions of this track Maiden recorded (only the versions on Live After Death and Beast Over Hammersmith give it a run for the money). Next is \\"Fear of the Dark\\" recorded in Buenos Aires, Argentina. This rendition is one of the best the group did and rivals the version on Rock in Rio IMHO. We close the show with the band's theme song \\"Iron Maiden\\" recorded in Santiago, Chile. This live version is one of the best I heard (my favorite was still Dortmund 1983 when Eddie (the band's mascot) got his \\"just desserts\\")! The encores begin with \\"Moonchild\\" recorded in San Juan, Puerto Rico. This version is the best ofthe two officially recorded. Next is my favorite live version of \\"The Clairvoyant\\" recorded in Curitiba, Brazil. This great track just burns. We close preceedings with the live version of \\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\" recorded at The Air Canada Center in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. This version just blows the roof off the building!<br />Iron Maiden's Flight 666 is a stellar live album. I ranked the live recordings with Live After Death and Rock in Rio tied for first, Beast Over Hammersmith (second), Flight 666 and Maiden England 1988 (third), Death On the Road (fourth), A Real Dead One (fifth), A Real Live One (sixth) and last was Live in Donnington 1992. If one needs to have any live Maiden album, get this one (along with Rio and Live After Death).<br />Highly recommended!the two officially recorded.

0882709194|1.0|Be careful readers who are interested in reading Charles Darwin's book, On the Origin of Species. Note the difference in the title. This book, Origin of Species, is carefully constructed to mislead inquiring minds. Intelligent design, which is being promoted in the \\"special introduction\\" of this textbook is not science. Science follows strict standards for testing hypotheses. The questions must be testable and the question must be falsifiable. Although intelligent design may be a belief that many share, it cannot be tested or falsified, therefore it is not science and as such does not belong in any scientific textbook or classroom.     Thus, back to this book. I'm not even sure it is legal that this religious company published this. There is nothing on the cover, and barely anything in the back text, indicating that 1/3 of the book is an introduction written by someone with no science background at all. Clearly, Ray Comfort has no business attempting to interpret science. And the \\"abridged\\" version is a joke. They basically deleted the final few chapters of the true book, and naturally, these final chapters contain some of the most compelling arguments and evidence that Darwin presents. I compared the real book to this book and discovered that they basically deleted anything of substance and left the paragraphs where Darwin discusses problems or gaps in his data. All scientists run into problems like this and work through it. The editing was very selective, deceptive, and flat out sneaky. And these religious folks call themselves honest?     I liken this publication to this: Imagine that I wrote an \\"additional\\" chapter to a Hemingway novel. Then I sold it under Hemingway's name so I could get the press I desired. There would be a massive outcry from the public and I'd probably have to deal with some serious legal issues. I see this publication as a threat to copyright laws and I see Amazon as a company that doesn't do their research to make sure that what they are selling is legitimate and honest. Shame on Amazon for selling this book.
B002Y0KR9I|5.0|Bram Stoker's vampire novel has been remade dozens of times, but one of the best adaptations is the classic Bela Lugosi version. Fairly faithful to the novel and dripping with gothic atmosphere, what really makes \\"Dracula\\" stand out is the bone-chillingly charming performance by Lugosi -- he's charming, powerful, and eerie in every scene, and the entire movie is brimming over with classic horror atmosphere.<br /><br />A solicitor, Renfield (Dwight Frye), is travelling to Count Dracula's castle for a real estate deal, despite the locals freaking out and crossing themselves whenever Dracula's mentioned. He soon finds out why -- the Count (Lugosi) is a vampire, who enslaves a mad Renfield to his will. Soon after, a ship with a dead crew (and Renfield and Dracula in the hold) arrives in England.<br /><br />Soon Dracula has moved into his new home, Carfax Abbey, and is insinuating himself with the Seward family -- and especially with pretty Lucy Westenra, who dies of blood loss and is reborn as a vampire. Only the intervention of the mysterious Dr. Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan) can stop Dracula's attacks in London.<br /><br />Then there's the Spanish-language one, which is virtually identical and was filmed on the exact same sets, during the hours when the English-language one was not being shot. Same settings, same marks, same cinematography, many of the same scenes -- although it's much longer. It's excellent, and although it lacks that iconic intensity that Lugosi brought the English-language film, it's full of atmosphere and good acting.<br /><br />Technically \\"Dracula\\" wasn't the first adaptation of \\"Dracula\\" -- that honor belongs to \\"Nosferatu\\" -- but it was the first to actually tackle the storyline in Stoker's book. And to date, it's perhaps the only to portray everyone's favorite vampire with the necessary atmosphere -- ominous, dignified and creepy.<br /><br />Tod Browning sets it in all the necssary places -- crumbling castles, savage mountainous villages, foggy London streets, and sumptuous Victorian drawing rooms with eerie noises from outside. Granted, a fair amount of stuff is changed -- Jonathan Harker is partially replaced by the mad Renfield -- but none of these really detract from the storyline.<br /><br />And Browning pours the creepiness on thickly, such as Dracula's seduction of young women, which keeps up the whole idea of vampiric sexuality. But Browning also knows how to pour on the subtle horror, without blood or violence -- like any scene with Renfield.<br /><br />The script is just as great as the direction, with some unspeakably good dialogue (\\"For one who has not lived even a single lifetime, you're a wise man, Van Helsing\\"), usually from Dracula. But the best scenes and dialogue are made up of highlights from the novel (such as Dracula saying dreamily, \\"Listen to them, the children of the night. What music they make!\\").<br /><br />But the star of all this is Lugosi himself, one of the two quintessential vampire actors (the other being Christopher Lee). While he doesn't resemble the book's Dracula, his hypnotic stare and charming, intense manner make him an ideal vampire count. And Frye deserves a nod for one of the nastiest, maddest, creepinest performances in cinema history. Sort of a nuttier, bug-eating Gollum (\\"Not when I can get nice fat spiders!\\").<br /><br />The original \\"Dracula\\" is still the best, more than seventy years after it was made. Dripping with Gothic atmosphere and seductive charm, this is a magnificent piece of work.ctorian drawing rooms with eerie noises from outside.

B001ILHY1I|4.0|In \\"Death Race\\", a 2008 remake of the Roger Corman cult classic \\"Death Race 2000\\", the cars are armed and armored, the drivers are (mostly) real killers, and the cross country race of the original has been replaced by a closed-course, high-tech circuit around a dark and forbidding island prison.  A solid cast is headed by Jason Statham as Jensen Ames, an ex-con framed for murder to get him behind the wheel of one of the death cars.  Joan Allen plays the cooly sadistic prison warden managing and manipulating the pay-for-view race.  Natalie Martinez is Ames' tough but attractive navigator. Tyrese Gibson is scary as Ames homicidal main competitor.  Ian McShane steals the show as an aging but savy prison car mechanic.<br /><br />Director Paul Anderson tries to inject a little plot by giving Statham a baby girl on the outside to live for, and a killer on the inside to take revenge on, but mostly this movie is about the violent, almost video game-quality action around the race course.  Cars careen around the circuit, firing machine guns and dispensing napalm and other goodies while whittling down the competition.  The intervels between race sets provide short opportunities to establish character motivation and set up a double surprise ending.<br /><br />\\"Death Race\\" is stylishly staged violence on wheels.  If the viewer is into that type of movie, this is one to watch.

0307454541|5.0|This book pulls you in from the opening pages, with the anonymous delivery of a rare, pressed flower to an elderly man, Henrik Vanger.  He receives a different rare flower every year on his birthday.  It turns out this is only one of 3 intermingled stories in the book: The wealthy, powerful, and strange Vanger family, who have wondered about the disappearance of Harriet Vanger some forty years earlier; the journalist Mikael Blomkvist, who's just been convicted of slandering a crooked industrialist and who would like to clear his name but for now just wants some time away from the magazine he part-owns and writes for; and finally Lizbeth Salander, a multi-tattooed and pierced young woman who, while she has difficulty getting close to anyone, nevertheless using all her street smarts and her \\"investigating skills\\" can find anything out about anyone.<br /><br />Yes, the Swedish setting made it a little more challenging at the beginning, but not for long.  And the various Vanger family members were hard to keep straight, but the family tree included early in the book took care of that problem too.  Sexually speaking, some of the characters were really twisted.  But, all in all, a great read....  the sooner I can lay my hands on \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\", the better.
B002HWRYJE|1.0|Talk about pre-hype:  First off, I am a Star Trek fan.  I was really waiting to see this movie, especially after all the so-called rave-reviews that were on television.  But, how disappointing the movie was (that had fine actors in it) with its lack of a credible story.  The movie was all over the map that just wondered aimlessly.<br /><br />I remember watching it thinking the movie is \\"too busy\\", too much like a Star Wars movie with its space battles and the crew bays with shipmen departing...some were even costumed in what appeared to be Star War officer uniforms with caps to boot.  Some of the aliens with their absurd character faces in the bar, another of the nurse with her over-sized eyes on the space shuttle helping to deliver old James Kirk.  Granted, Star Trek has its share of weird alien makeup, but as a whole Star Wars just seems to have a lot more cartoonish looking aliens that just didn't seem to fit well in Star Trek.  Sure enough, after watching the special features, J.J. Abrams mentioned that he wanted to spice up the feel of the franchise with a Star Wars feel to it.  Well, he succeeded in that, but failed miserably with the movie as a whole.<br /><br />J.J. Abrams needed to heed the old saying that, \\"less is more.\\"<br /><br />The opening scene with the Romulan space ship that looked like a giant metal squid with it tentacles was ludicrous.  This whole movie just seemed like a kid with too much money just \\"having at it\\" without really thinking it through and coming up with a decent story line.  I think William Shatner can count his blessings that Abrams wasn't able to work him into the script, because this movie is pretty lame.  I even tried watching it a second and third time to see if it would grow on me...it didn't.  It was just as lack luster and lame as the first viewing.  I kept thinking while watching the first time, \\"When's this going to pick up and get better?\\"  \\"Where's the beef?<br /><br />The scene where Abrams has young Kirk (Chris Pine)slobbering all over an apple while taking the Kobayashi Maru test/exam was idiotic.  Was this act of eating the apple suppose to be conveying a cavalier attitude or something?  It just came across as stupid and juvenile, and it's hard to believe that the writers and/or Abrams thought that particular action in that scene was clever or humorous.<br /><br />Having said all this, I would watch the next Star Trek movie that he produces, because it can't go anywhere but up.  The first movie, \\"Star Trek, The Motion Picture\\" suffered from similar antics: too much spectacle with little substance, but then was followed by the \\"Wrath of Khan.\\"  Maybe, lightning will strike twice here, and J.J. Abrams will produce a better movie the second time around.<br /><br />What Abrams needs to do if he should produce another Star Trek movie is to hire someone like Nicholas Myer to write or co-write the script perhaps with Leonard Nimoy, and have Nicholas Myer direct it, and have Abrams stay the hell out of their way...then you'll probably have something worth watching.  Both men know the essence of Star Trek, and could no doubt right the franchise, and put it back on track.  Some of the best Star Trek movies written and directed have come from those two men.  The only benefit that Abrams could offer is that he's the \\"latest flavor of the month\\" in Hollywood when it comes to getting movies made...he's the current \\"Golden Boy.\\"  He needs to use that current advantage to secure the financing, but then let other people take over the reins to put out a product worth watching.
B00064X3FO|5.0|This is the first album I was ever given, I received it as a christmas gift along with my first stereo. I recently added it to my CD collection and had forgotten how amazing this collection of songs is, this version is even more amazing due to the sound quality. It is for the most part dark and melancholy but has its bright spots and all of the songs are a necessary part of the whole. This is an epic album and I believe essential for any classic rock collection. I believe this is his best work to date.
B002JTMNX2|5.0|After listening to Can't Slow Down for several days now, I have become a convert. Honestly I was not that impressed the first time I heard it, but it definitely has grown on me. Yes, I still believe Foreigner will never be the same without Lou Gramm's vocals (see my review of Insider Information). What it was before it is no longer. I said I could not imagine liking anything but the original line-up of the group. However, this new incarnation is surprisingly high quality. I am actually glad to have to eat my words because I truly enjoy this album. More than just enjoying it, I find myself coming back to it again and again. The album has an integrity and a consistently smooth sound, which again is different from the Lou Gramm days. Yes, it does have hints of the old Foreigner sound, and Kelley Hansen is a good fit on vocals, but it really is a new band.<br /><br />Once I stopped comparing this to the Foreigner of the 80s, I could appreciate it for what it is. What if I just picked this up and listened to it simply as a new album by a new band? While this admittedly this is impossible, I believe I would find myself drawn into to the hooks and harmonies. Mick Jones' composing is up to modern standards and sounds fresh even while it echoes the past. Especially fine are \\"I'll Be Home Tonight,\\" \\"As Long as I Live,\\" and \\"Angel Tonight,\\" but there are really no filler tracks here. Production is top notch, and the tunes are catchy. Unlike another reviewer, I like the mix of ballads just fine. I believe you will find, as I did, that this new Foreigner has truly struck a good chord.

B00275EGWY|5.0|The DVD has not been released yet, but I did see the movie in a theater one mile from Fort Knox.  I really enjoyed it!  I don't mind a movie that shows arguments for or against something, but this movie isn't so lumpishly awful and obvious as \\"Redacted\\" and the other recent drivel from brainless self-proclaimed 'morally-superior' Hollywood fools like Brian DePalma:  this film lets you watch the action, experience the interaction among the characters, hear questions raised about the subjects that less adept directors clumbsily handle like a bludgeon, and leave you satisfied that you've seen a movie, not a ham-handed political 'statement' by some loser director who hasn't made a good film in years.  I was unaware of Kathryn Bigelow (the director of \\"The Hurt Locker\\") and her body of work, but I'm renting them one-by-one now.  This is an excellent film!  I realize it will not stand up to the scrutiny of those in the bomb-diffusing field, but this is a movie made for a wide audience.  Imagine how hard cops laugh at the procedures and practices they see in every \\"cop\\" film.  Luckily, or unluckily, I'm a designer... and the only recent film that addresses that, tangently, is \\"Elizabethtown\\".
B002LVUG3C|5.0|This November 2009 EMI Limited Edition 2CD set (Oct in the UK) is a 40th Anniversary celebration of Bowie's long forgotten and criminally underrated 2nd album - \\"David Bowie\\" [later known as \\"Space Oddity\\"]. There's a lot on here, so let's get to the details...<br /><br />Disc 1 (46:12 minutes)<br />Tracks 1 to 9 are the album \\"David Bowie\\" issued 14 November 1969 on Phillips SBL 7902 in the UK (produced by TONY VISCONTI). Released in the same month in the USA but with slightly altered artwork (the photo on the cover is used as the 1st page of the booklet), the US version was re-titled as \\"Man Of Words/Man Of Music\\" and issued on Mercury SR-61246.<br /><br />Disc 2 (63:47 minutes):<br />1. Space Oddity (early 'Demo' version featuring duet vocals with John \\"Hutch\\" Hutchinson, recorded January 1969)<br />2. An Occasional Dream (early 'Demo' version also featuring duet vocals with John \\"Hutch\\" Hutchinson, recorded March/April 1969)<br />3. Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud (this is an alternate version put out as the non-album B-side to \\"Space Oddity\\" issued in July 1969 as a UK 7\\" single on Philips BF 1801. It contains the Paul Buckmaster spoken intro and less brass and strings - none of which are on the LP version)<br />4. Let Me Sleep Beside You<br />5. Unwashed And Somewhat Slightly Dazed<br />6. Janine<br />4 to 6 were recorded live for the Dave Lee Travis show on the BBC's Radio 1 on 20 Oct 1969 (broadcast 26 Oct). 5 and 6 have been issued before on the 2000 CD set \\"Bowie On The Beeb...\\" but 4 is previously unreleased<br />7. London, Bye, Ta-Ta (Stereo Version) (recorded in January 1970 in Trident Studios as a follow up single to \\"Space Oddity\\" but shelved, this version first appeared on the \\"Sound + Vision\\" 4CD Box set in 2003)<br />8. The Prettiest Star (Stereo Version) (released as a UK 7\\" single in March 1970 on Mercury MF 1135 but only in MONO - this STEREO version first appeared on the 1997 compilation \\"The Best Of...1969/1974\\")<br />9. Conversation Piece (Stereo Version) (the non-album B-side to \\"The Prettiest Star\\" 7\\" single which was only ever issued in MONO - this is a previously unreleased STEREO version)<br />10. Memory Of A Free Festival (Part 1)<br />11. Memory Of A Free Festival (Part 2)<br />10 and 11 are the A&B of the June 1970 UK 7\\" single on Philips 6052 026. This is not the LP track, but a re-recorded version then split across two sides of a single. These first appeared on the Ryko CD version of \\"Space Oddity\\" in 1990.<br />12. Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud (Alternate Album Mix)<br />13. Memory Of A Free Festival (Alternate Album Mix) (previously unreleased version that is over 2 minutes longer)<br />14. London, Bye, Ta-Ta (Alternate Stereo Mix)<br />15. Ragazzo Solo, Ragazza Sola (Full Length Stereo Version) (the 1970 Italian version of \\"Space Oddity\\". It translates into \\"Lonely Boy, Lonely Girl\\". The single mix turned on the \\"Bowie Rare\\" LP in 1983, but this version is previously unreleased)<br /><br />1, 2, 4, 9, 12 to 15 are previously unreleased<br /><br />The British album (on which this release is based) originally came in a fetching gatefold sleeve (now a hugely collectable £400 vinyl rarity in mint condition) and it's this artwork that's used for both the back and front cover of the tri-gatefold digipak. Different Trident Studios Master Tape boxes are pictured under each see-through CD tray, while the 32-page booklet is a feast of memorabilia from fans and collectors - rare picture sleeves, trade adverts, period photos - all topped off with a fantastically detailed essay by noted expert KEVIN CANN.<br /><br />If I was to have a gripe about the booklet and the packaging, it would be this - on the back of the UK success of the \\"Hunky Dory\\" album in September 1972 (reached number 3 in the UK charts), the \\"David Bowie\\" album was then reissued in November 1972 on RCA Victor LSP 4813 as \\"Space Oddity\\". It came in different artwork and was given an inner lyric bag and a foldout poster. I mention this because for such an extensive and superbly annotated booklet, none of this is printed or pictured - an odd omission?<br /><br />But it's a minor point because the real sparks are to be found in the SOUND. Remastered from the first generation master tapes by PETER MEW at Abbey Road with help from TRIS PENNA and NIGEL REEVE - the audio is FABULOUS. I've sung the praises of Peter Mew's work before (Jethro Tull's \\"This Was\\" and Dr. Feelgood's \\"Down At The Jetty\\" jump to mind - see reviews) and having years and hundreds of credits to his name, he knows his way around a tape or two. I've never heard the track \\"Space Oddity\\" sound so clear and full - it's a superlative job. The clarity on the two newly found demos at the beginning of Disc 2 is incredible also - especially given their vintage and crude recordings.<br /><br />The music itself is an acquired taste. Not quite the Sixties pop of his debut or the Seventies rock brilliance of \\"Ziggy\\" and \\"Hunky Dory\\" which was just around the corner, it's a man finding his artistic feet - ideas are everywhere - and it's even quite folky in places. It won't be everyone's cup of tea for sure, but if you've the inclination, it's a rediscovery well worth making...<br /><br />To sum up - this is a superb reissue - and it's the dogs bollox where it matters the most - in the sound department.<br /><br />Far above the world - sitting in his tin can - Major Tom is grinning...<br /><br />Recommended.ssion?

B002L3RVCY|5.0|This is a great product!  Watching the individual episodes without the commercial break fade-outs and no Cartoon Network logo printed onscreen is the BEST way to see these wonderful shows!  Each episode has a corresponding featurette that outlines the production of that episode.  There is a booklet of arwork affixed to the center of the DVD case that affords a cool look into the storyteller's minds.<br /><br />My only complaint is:  I LOVE behind the scenes materials!  I would've really enjoyed something that showed even MORE aspects of their production... sculpting maquettes, scanning them, animation nodes, storyboard to digital comparisome... I can think of so much more I'd have loved to have seen... sniff... sob... I guess I can't have it all.<br /><br />It's a great pleasure to have the entire season at fingertip's grasp.  I was disappointed at the decision to release the episodes in individual DVD's containing a few episodes each.  I don't know how Lucasfilm made out on that decision, but I refused to buy them in that format and waited, hoping the entire season would be released as a whole.  Well, folks, here it is... and it's great!
B002BSHWUU|5.0|My first inclination when adding the remastered versions of The Beatles catalog was to immediately delete the old C.D. versions from my i-Tunes library to free up space.  However, after listening to the new C.D.'s (about one a day as a special treat) I discovered the difference of my newfound treasure.      The difference between the old and new C.D.'s was (and is) striking.  A comparison in my I-tunes library was obvious: The new master of '[[ASIN:B0025KVLRY With The Beatles (Remastered)]]' is richer and clearer.  I don't have the most discerning ear, but the new versions are definitely better.  With each C.D. I tried it out on the C.D. player, in the car stereo, and on the I-pod.      Here are some startling examples:  \\"Michelle\\" in the I-pod blew me away:  '[[ASIN:B0025KVLT2 Rubber Soul (Remastered)]]' surely has a magnificent texture to begin with, but the new sound is even more terrific!  (The rewards of listening to the new versions on the i-Pod are immediate.) When listening to \\"Strawberry Fields Forever,\\" in the car, the cellos became so distinct, it isn't an exaggeration to say they are now tangible as well as audible.  Upon further listening I discovered \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" doesn't sound as murky, and the brass on \\"Martha My Dear\\" has superb clarity.  These were the times when I was floored by the difference.  All the rest of the sound tests found the collection still detectably worthwhile, only not quite as ear-blowing.      Originally, I came upon the news of the remastered works of The Beatles as a mixed blessing:  I was skeptical of the quality, yet I embraced any improvement of my favorite rock band's portfolio.  Nevertheless, it isn't hard to think of each new advance in technology as another scheme to get consumers to start all over--and make everyone richer once again.  I resolved to try `[[ASIN:B0025KVLTC Revolver (Remastered)]],` my favorite Beatles' album, and then get another one every year thereafter.  (I was a bit miffed because about a year or so before the remastered recordings arrived,  I had just finished replacing every album in this boxed set on C.D..  That's a different story, but I'm sure many people can relate to my predicament.)      I was first enticed to get the boxed set when Amazon sent a video advertisement heralding the new selections.  I did a comparison between \\"Here, There, and Everywhere\\" from their preview sampler and the one in my library, and I felt the need to move more quickly on the bonanza.    Fortunately for me, Santa Claus came early, and an unnamed benefactor solved my problem of coveting a truly memorable step up in Beatles' music history.  I hope he's as good to you--either from the giving or receiving end--as he was to me.    Thanks for reading, and happy holidays!    Rocky Raccoon :>)      (PS The Amazon sampler and description are enticing, but, if you're not convinced, I encourage you to read 'Rolling Stone's concise and convincing review of the boxed set--available online.)

B001CZVVW8|5.0|One of my favorite Russian opera, Eugene Onegin, by Tchaikovsky, was recently presented in national cinemas. I do not have time to go to the movies, I was content with the DVD. Just like the one shown in the cinema.   The operas produced nowadays are thought and planned the theater for the video. Increasingly, we can see the aesthetic image of the presentations: sets, costumes, lighting, movements of the singers and chorus, it is thought that the recording be plastic. Time's up for a camera recording everything in the center. Now we have several cameras covering angles previously unimaginable.   The version of the Metropolitan Opera House in New York's stellar cast. The baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky, exceptional as Onegin. The soprano Renée Fleming, lyrical voice, sweet, have great aria in the Charter, large Tatiana. Ramón Vargas is one of the great tenors of our time, and his aria of farewell is moving. Featured with praise for Sergei Aleksashkin as Prince Gremin, beautiful aria sung by a bass and portentous for me unknown Jean-Paul Fouchécourt, a Triquet hilarious. I can not say whether there was manipulation of the voices in the video, I heard bordering on perfection.   The sets designed by Michael Levine are almost nonexistent, has turned fashion shows with stage clean. It gives a modern air to function, and still saves a beautiful dough. The costumes are right, sin in the ballroom scene of Act II, rustic look to other participates of the party. The direction by Peter McClintock uses an idea manjada causes Onegin to the beginning of the show lamenting his fate. With Tatiana's letter in hand, he is recalling the events through the opera. The lighting is strong point of production, intelligent and creative, highlights the events clearly.   Presented by the nostalgic Beverly Sills, the DVD contains interviews with the actors and producers behind the scenes montage. The governing Gergiev is simple, direct, effective. Russian conductor who understands the subtletyand delicacy of the score and the orchestra is expressing this SENSITIVITIES. The image and sound recorded in HD are flawless, the direction of images and experienced veteran Brian Large is excellent. Finally! A DVD of Eugene Onegin must for lovers of Russian opera.      Eugene Onegin-Obra prima de Tchaikovsky em montagem memorável do MET    Uma de minhas óperas russas favoritas, Eugene Onegin,  de Tchaikovsky, foi recentemente apresentada nos cinemas nacionais. Como não tenho tempo para ir ao cinema, me contentei com o DVD. Igualzinho ao apresentado no cinema.   As óperas produzidas nos dias atuais são pensadas e programadas do teatro para o vídeo. Cada vez mais, se nota a estética da imagem nas apresentações: cenários, figurinos, iluminação, movimentações dos cantores e coral, tudo é pensado para que a gravação fique plástica. Acabou o tempo de uma câmera no centro gravando tudo. Agora  temos diversas câmeras,  que cobrem ângulos antes inimagináveis.   A Versão do Metropolitan Opera House de New York tem elenco estrelar. O barítono Dmitri Hvorostovsky, excepcional como Onegin. O soprano Renée Fleming , voz lírica, adocicada,manda muito bem na Ária da Carta, grande Tatiana. Ramón Vargas é  um dos grandes tenores da atualidade, e sua ária de despedida é comovente. Destaque com louvor para Sergei Aleksashkin como Príncipe Gremin, belíssima ária cantada por um baixo portentoso e o por mim desconhecido Jean-Paul Fouchécourt, um Triquet hilário. Não posso afirmar se houve manipulação das vozes no vídeo, o que ouvi beirava a perfeição.  Os cenários  concebidos por Michael Levine são quase inexistentes, tem virado moda espetáculos com palcos limpos. Dá um ar de moderno à função, e ainda se economiza uma bela grana. Os figurinos são corretos, pecam na cena do baile do segundo ato, visual caipira demais aos participates da festa. A direção de Peter McClintock usa uma idéia manjada, faz com que Onegin apareça no começodo espetáculo lamentando seu destino. Com a carta de Tatiana na mão, ele vai relembrando os acontecimentos através da ópera. A iluminação é ponto forte da produção, inteligente e criativa, realça os acontecimentos com clareza.  Apresentado pela saudosa Beverly Sills, o  DVD contém entrevistas com os protagonistas e produtores e mostra os bastidores da montagem.  A regência de Gergiev é simples, direta, efetiva. Maestro russo que entende a sutileza e  a delicadeza da partitura e faz a orquestra expressar essa sensibildade. A imagem e o som gravados em HD são impecáveis, a direção de imagens do veterano e experimentado Brian Large é excelente. Enfim! Um DVD de Eugene Onegin imperdível para quem gosta de ópera russa.

B002QH2NUA|5.0|Paul McCartney has more money than Bill Gates - he continues to write and record new songs simply to express his love of music and he continues to tour to share his love of music with his millions of fans.  \\"Good Evening New York City\\" is a superbly recorded two hour concert of songs from the Beatles and from Paul McCartney's four decades of writing and performing.  Adding a two hour DVD filmed version of the concert to the package and pricing it at just $15 for two CD's and a DVD makes this Paul's gift to his fans.<br /><br />Over the decades, Paul has recorded many \\"live\\" concerts.  Some of the songs on \\"Good Evening\\" are available on half a dozen albums.  Yet, \\"Good Evening New York City\\" is special...it may be the pinnacle of McCartney's career.  He and his crack band put on a wonderful show.  The rock songs have lots of energy, sometimes they rock harder than the original versions, and the ballads have nuances than come from maturity and experience.<br /><br />What make \\"Good Evening\\" perhaps the \\"ultimate\\" McCarney collection is the song selection.  He brings together great songs from the Beatles, from Wings, and from his solo career.  His \\"live\\" versions of some of his more recent songs, such as \\"Only Mama Knows\\", \\"Dance Tonight\\" and \\"Highway\\" are a wonderful \\"fit\\" with songs he wrote almost fifty years ago.<br /><br />The sound engineers did a great job of preserving the feel and energy of a \\"live\\" performance, while also preserving the subtle details of each instrument, and balancing the vocals with the band.  A stereo system that plays loudly with lots of deep bass will let you enjoy both the power and subtlety of Paul's astounding skill on the bass guitar, something that gets missed with TV speakers or cheapo earbuds.<br /><br />Yes, if you are a Beatle's fan, or a McCartney fan, you already own two or three versions of most of these songs.  But, \\"Good Evening\\" is truly special, and at the silly low price of this CD and DVD set, it is a wonderful gift from Paul to his fans...you NEED \\"Good Evening\\" in your collection.<br /><br />Millions of people have enjoyed Paul's music over the past four decades, and people will be listening to Paul's music for many decades to come.  If you have someone in your family who is age ten to age twenty, \\"Good Evening\\" would be the perfect gift...for most younger folks, Paul's music will be both \\"brand new\\" and amazing.Good Evening\\" in your collection.

B002MBAJ4M|5.0|Being a fan of the band since it's beginning I was most interested to hear what the new \\"direction\\" was going to sound like. WOW. Is that enough? New bass player Jorgen Carlsson was definetly the right choice and Warren is writing and playing as well as ever. How he does it with so many irons in the fire I wish I knew,but he is THE man. The band is really locked in and \\"hittin the note\\".The songs on this collection run the gambut of subject matter and style,and of course Warren has pulled out another lost gem with Railroad Boy,a smoking arrangement of an old field blues standard from who knows where( I don't but I'm sure someone out there does).   Billy Gibbons and Warren trading licks is sweet on Broke down on the Brazos,and Frozen Fear is a bit of Mule style R&B. Scenes from a Troubled Mind is a Warren 'dark' standard in the Life Before Insanity vein with Andy Hess on bass,a nice hold over from his time in the band I suspect. The entire disc is a joy to sink into,so far I can't stop listening to this disc.6 stars!

044654146X|3.0|While interesting to read for someone interested in innovation policy and programmes, the book was mostly a collection of anecdotes and stories around particular individuals, start-ups and programmes, a narrative weaved around the various aspects of the development of Israel as a high-tech hub.<br /><br />The authors (and their editors) also do themselves a disservice by allowing factually incorrect information to slip into their work, supported by the often-used weasil words \\"according to some experts\\" (see e.g. page 199 \\"Jebel Ali Port...according to some experts...ranked alongside the Great Wall of China and the Hoover Dam as the only three man-made constructions that can be seen from space\\".)<br /><br />Further, I would suggest reading the following excerpt from page 33, followed by e.g. the wikipedia entry at [...] to assess for oneself how balanced you would find the authors interpretations[I have other examples]:<br />\\"But until the 1970's, computers were used predominantly by rocket scientists and big universities. Some computers took up whole rooms or even buildings. The idea of a computer on your office desk or in your home was the stuff of science fiction. All that began to change in 1980, when Intel's Haifa team designed the 8088 chip, whose transistors could flip almost five million times per second (4.77mhz) and were small enough to allow for the creation of computers that would fit in homes and offices.<br /><br />IBM chosen Israel's 8088 chip as the brains for its first \\"personal computer\\", or PC, launching a new era of computer. It [the IBM contract] was also a major breakthrough for Intel.\\"<br /><br />Apart from the book occasionally starting to sound like marketing material, I also suspect that I could have got all I needed out of the book if it were only 120 pages instead of 220+. It *did* have material that was very interesting and useful to me, particularly around the nature of Israeli culture (challenge authority, question constantly, team-driven, high responsibility at an early age &lt;- military conscription, competitive, blunt, multicultural with the waves of immigration from various lands).

B000IFS0HM|2.0|ASHES ONLY ASHES    REVIEW:  McCourt, Frank.  Angela's Ashes.  New York:  Scribner, 1996.     Angela's Ashes is the recitation of a life of poverty suffered by an Irish boy in the middle decades of the 20th century.   The book is repellant.  There is no other way to describe it.  No other response is possible when a reader is presented with such anguish, and repressed anguish, emotionless anguish.   I am uncertain why readers are interested in a story of such unredeeming misery.  There must be a masochistic element in the readership of the book.  Or, there must remain in our society many persons of repressive Catholic background who remember their miserable Catholicism while coming of age.   But then I do know the interest the story elicits.  There is such guilt in our society because of our materialism and hedonism that the book performs a catharsis in its readers.  (A corollary of this perception is that white folk like to hear about other white folk in extremity, as it relieves them about the misery they may be inflicting on those who are not white.)  The members of this society seek to punish themselves, as evidenced elsewhere by the horrible, frightful and vulgar behavior in our entertainment media and our personal relations.  The book is part of that milieu, culturally perverted, the \\"dumbed-down\\" of every value and decency.  Even though the author may not have intended such an effect, once the book was published it became part of it.    The book is not a triumph of the human spirit.  Rather, it is the ravings of a simple ego seeking to survive as does any dog, though a literate one in this case.  It plumbs the depths of our dysfunctional society, and resonates there in our psychic malaise.  I will demonstrate how the author accomplished it, whether by craft or chance and in his understated manner.  Immediately at the beginning (page 11), the author writes:  \\"It was, of course, a miserable childhood:  the happy childhood is hardly worth your while.\\"  Do you understand how perverted is this statement?  The bad childhood is thus the standard for life and art.  It casts us immediately into a hopeless existence.  Then (on page 145), the author's mother tells us that she is in hell (as are all of us who read the book):  \\"Bridey laughs.  Oh, Angela, you could go to hell for that, and Mam says, aren't I there already, Bridey?\\"  It is hell, a special hell created just for the Irish because they believe in it so fervently.  It is made of the Damp, the Drink and the Dump, otherwise known as the Church. The author goes on to claim (on page 202):  \\"It's lovely to know that the world can't interfere with the inside of your head.\\"  Oh, no, this is disingenuous.  The world does nothing except interfere with the inside of your head.  That's what the Damp, the Drink and the Dump do.  It is the everlasting struggle for your mind, a battle you must fight tenaciously and without rest forever.  The author furthers this point (on page 247) by having the young boy think:  \\"It's a mystery.  That's what the priests and the masters tell you, everything is a mystery and you have to believe what you're told.\\"  Thus life is stupidity compounded with the refusal to use the rationality that the universe endowed you with.  The novel culminates with the wisdom distilled from his life that Mr. Sliney (on page 353) imparts to the young Frank:  \\"What I want to tell you is, Never smoke another man's pipe.\\"  That's what the entire miserable life of the boy is:  smoking another man's pipe.   So there you have it:  miserable hopelessness, hell, messy inside of your head, life as mystery, and smoking someone else's pipe.  Nothing could be more dysfunctional, and thus a reflection (writ small) of our times.  The popularity of the book is the indicator of our malaise.   The book made me feel unclean and violated in mind and in emotion.  The grossness of the father sucking the snot out of his infant son's nostrils unfortunately will stay with me forever.  It is anugly book despite the superficial charm of its language.  The relentlessness of that language deceives its readers about its repellant nature.  It is thus evil, and profoundly depressing.  It is a memoir of identity with a vengeance.  The book is a symbol of the catastrophe of our civilization, or even of our species.  The ashes are those of Angela's poor, hopeless fire, and those dead, sour, caked and soggy ashes encrusted on another man's pipe.   I am happy the author survived his childhood, if indeed he has, and made as an artist a minor masterpiece of a major misery.  And in America (on page 363) there is the statement, \\"...a great country altogether?\\"   Hummmmm.  (TRC 03-05-01)         (TRC Final Revision 08-17-09)

Then it was just waiting in antici--<br /><br />--pation! It finally arrived, and it was worth the wait. The model is high quality and has a wonderful weight to it. I don't typically splurge on higher-cost collectibles such as this, but with its limited run, and great quality, I'm glad I did. Oh and the Bluray is also a great piece of work. The special features were very informative and entertaining, especially as they touched on the issues with 're-envisioning' the Star Trek universe, from many creative perspectives.<br /><br />This was a fun little video to render! Thank you JJ for inventing the Abrams flare ;)

B002QEXN2K|4.0|I'm a huge fan of John Mayer, and after listening to the album a few times I ended up loving it! Some of the songs are just so heartfelt. It's as if you can personally feel his pain, and not just through his lyrics but through his voice, and I honestly have never had a song make me feel this way unless I related to it. This is evident specifically in songs like \\"Edge of desire\\" and \\"Assassin\\", it's apparent that he poured his heart and soul into this album, and if you're a John Mayer fan like I am, then that's definitely something worth listening to.
0470477237|5.0|Erik Qualman's depiction of social media and how it impacts our life and business is right on target. Not only does he give us his well qualified opinion, he backs it up with boatloads of quantifiable statistics. No longer is social media a fuzzy, non-definable and non-measurable concept. It is reality.    Qualman brings to our attention the ubiquity of social media in our lives today, even if we thought it was still something 'out there' in the future. He sets the stage for us to understand our reliance on it now and helps us understand how it will continue to shape how we live, interact and conduct business.     Every marketer worth their weight in pixels should read and understand Socialnomics. It forms the structure on which basic tactical marketing will be hung. Excellent read.    ~Diane Vautier   @dvautier
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Food, Inc. is valuable viewing for anyone who eats or feeds their family. The documentary is well made, and really serves as an introduction to the current food production practices that dictate the supply chain of the modern diet. In this video, you will learn:<br /><br />1. That marketing of food products is very misleading. Most marketing attempts to present a wholesome and agrarian image leading consumers to believe that their foods come from natural and beautiful farms. Yet in reality most food comes from extremely unpleasant, and oftentimes barbaric, food factories.<br /><br />2. Corporatization in a consumer society is destroying quality of life. When nothing matters but the bottom line and decisions are made in board rooms thousands of miles away from actual sites, where the primary concern is profit, quality goes out the window. Even worse, we begin to view living creatures as nothing but a collection of molecules that can and should be manipulated to maximize profit in the shortest amount of time, with total disregard to the pain and suffering caused to them. Consequently, it becomes accepted practice to subject them to a miserable and unnatural life, pump them with hormones and antibiotics, mutilate and hurt them callously, and so on. This in turn leads us to perceive fellow human beings in the same way, and the world in general as simply raw material that needs to be harvested for immediate gain by the most powerful. Classic corollary of merciless Darwinian thinking...<br /><br />3. It's not all doom and gloom. YOU have the power to make choices that will force multi-national corporations to change their practices by necessity. Educating yourself and your family, with information such as in this documentary, is critical to not only saving yourself and your loved ones from misery and victimhood out of ignorance, but in also creating global change. A great case study is presented in Food, Inc. where the largest retailer in the world, Walmart, has now chosen to carry organic and hormone-free products because their consumers have chosen it.<br /><br />4. Much more. There are lots of other topics and lessons one can gleam from this, and by making simple changes in the way we live and in the choices we make, we can begin returning to a more natural, fulfilling life. This is essential for future generations, for our children. Do we really want to pass onto them the world we inherited, where they are being exploited and manipulated out of ignorance?

0385504225|1.0|Like many people who bought this book, I did so because I had enjoyed The DaVinci Code so much. Now I wish I hadn't wasted my money or time. The writing, editing and character development are all the sort of thing any real Professor would give a freshman a \\"D\\" for. Batman & Robin's 1960s script writers came up with more compelling and believeable dialog than Dan Brown has tossed off here.    Dan Brown is looking like a one-hit wonder. At least The DaVinci Code was thought provoking. The Lost Symbol is nothing but a bit of cashing in on fame. Somewhere the editors and publishers know this, and they don't care. Just \\"gimme the money\\".
B000SXOI66|5.0|There is a reason this album has been on best-selling lists for what is now about 35 years: it's a masterpiece--timeless and perfect.  Definitely in my top 3 of all time.  If for some reason you are reading this review and you have not given this album a proper listen, then set aside an hour.  Preferably somewhere you can be undisturbed and listen on either a high-quality stereo or with good headphones.  And smoke some if you got some--it will only enhance the experience.     For my money, Dark Side of the Moon is Pink Floyd's most highest masterpiece--hypnotic, other-worldy, melodic, and beautiful.

0061849928|2.0|The first chapter is interesting enough to keep you reading, but it gets tiresome quite rapidly. The characters, funny as they may be - initially - are getting mired in a strange theory of conspiracy.  Unfortunately, the plot doesn't stick and the reader looses interest in it. After the VERY long description of the \\"Courier's Tragedy\\" play you are left with the feeling that enough is enough...I understand the pivotal, crucial part the play has in the book but still...devoting such a long chapter to it is an overkill.  The only motive to keep on reading is that the book is short, Pynchon is a true master of the English language, funny / interesting situations appear from time to time and one expects Pynchon to deliver.  This does not happen and the book ends leaving the reader with the feeling that he/she couldn't care more if the conspiracy detailed really had a base in reality or not.
B002QEXN2K|4.0|This album took some getting used to.  I first thought it was kind of boring, now I can't stop listening to it.  If you go into this expecting Continuum, you're going to be disappointed.<br />Individually, the tracks might not live up to his previous work, but as a whole, this album is excellent.<br /><br />I think the album cover might have been throwing me off.  It's HORRIBLE!  I just got around to changing it on my computer and it almost seemed to make the music better.  So, if you pretend the person playing this music is not the Johnson and Johnson shampoo model on the cover, it might make it easier to actually delve into this great album.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a concept album about the \\"war of love\\".  Listen to the lyrics.  They're his best yet.<br />Mayer doesn't go guitar crazy this time around, but he does have his moments exactly when they're appropriate.  The solos last as long as they need to and are well placed.  If you're buying a Mayer album for the guitar work, grab a Stevie Ray Vaughan or Jimi Hendrix record instead.  In fact, get one anyway.  :)<br /><br />Highlights:<br />\\"All We Ever Do Is Say Goodbye\\" is a beautiful love song about two people who can never really make it work.<br />\\"Half of My Heart\\" is a catchy pop song about a guy who isn't committed.<br />\\"War of My Life\\" sounds like a track from Heavier Things (my favorite Mayer album), so it gets Brownie points.<br />\\"Edge of Desire\\" is easily the best track on this album.<br />\\"Friends, Lovers, or Nothing\\" is addicting.  It's a well-crafted pop tune.  As another reviewer correctly put it, the coda has a \\"Hey Jude\\" vibe to it.  Fantastic song!  \\"Anything other than yes is no...\\"<br /><br />Bad Stuff:<br />\\"Crossroads\\" shouldn't have been on the album.  The cover is creative, but it doesn't fit in with the rest of the album.  The same goes for \\"Who Says.\\"<br /><br />What I think John Mayer's been listening to:<br />Eric Clapton (most obvious), The Beatles, Tom Petty, Fleetwood Mac (according to him), Robert Johnson (hence the cover)<br /><br />[...]
B000006U44|5.0|This remarkable debut album from Kate Bush was an immediate sensation in her native England and throughout Europe. \\"The Kick Inside\\" set the template for what would follow - literary, cinematic lyrics with sweeping orchestral arrangements - all sung dramatically in her inimitable soprano. The first single \\"Wuthering Heights\\" topped the British charts for weeks, and \\"The Man With The Child In His Eyes\\" was another big hit. She proved equally adept at ballads, rockers (\\"James And The Cold Gun\\"), and reggae (\\"Them Heavy People\\").    Kate had a lot of time to perfect this, which is an interesting story. Pink Floyd's David Gilmour took an early demo tape of these songs to the EMI label, which signed her up even though they knew they had to wait a couple years for her to finish school. The label didn't want to risk someone else getting her under contract. When finally released in 1978, Kate was 19 - and a star was born!    She must have been a fan of Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel when growing up, since two members of that band became important in her career. Keyboardist Duncan Mackay played on her first 3 albums, while drummer/percussionist Stuart Elliot remains on board to this day. It's known she liked David Bowie, and studied mime with his old teacher Lindsay Kemp. The only tour she's ever done (in 1979) was a choreographed, highly theatrical spectacle reminiscent of Bowie's '74 \\"David Live\\" tour. After a time, Bush began singing in a lower register. She re-recorded \\"Wuthering Heights\\" with this lower voice and put it on her greatest hits \\"The Whole Story\\". I'm partial to her original hit single version, which can only be found on \\"The Kick Inside\\". I still consider it to be one of the most magnificent singles ever made.    The five albums she recorded between '78 and '85 are my favorites. \\"Lionheart\\" was good, but stuck a little too close to the successful formula of its predecessor. Kate introduced some world-music flourishes into \\"Never For Ever\\", and densely layered electronic soundscapes for \\"The Dreaming\\". Her fifth album \\"Hounds Of Love\\" incorporated some Irish elements. All are wonderful, but this precocious debut is the place to start. It's a masterpiece.

Now, fortunately there is.<br /><br />Significantly, and a sign of the time, this 8th edition of `Employment Law' is twice as long as the 1st edition of 1991.So, in line with its original objectives, `Employment Law' has become the definitive work on this complex, continually changing area of law.<br /><br />As one might expect from a publication from the admirable Legal Action Group, the work is thorough, logically structured and, very usefully, claimant focused.  It's therefore ideal for voluntary sector advisers, legal advice centres, trades union representatives and of course, lawyers, as well as individuals looking for authoritative and practical guidance on employment law.<br /><br /> `Lewis on Employment Law' deals clearly and succinctly with the fast developing body of case law, together with the relevant domestic legislation, EU Treaties and directives.  As with all LAG publications, the approach is practical, with step-by-step guidance on running a case.  Whether you are a lawyer or layman, you'll find the summary of key points and extensive cross referencing and other aids to navigation helpful, not to mention the precedents, checklists, questionnaires, indicators to other research resources and glossary of terms.<br /><br />This is a volume you can check out for the latest in employment law as at 26 June 2009.  New material includes, for example, the new ACAS regime which replaces statutory dispute resolution. the Disability Discrimination Act post Lewisham LBC -v- Malcolm...coverage of the latest in discrimination law, particularly age and religious discrimination, plus the latest cases on statutory holiday entitlement and cases dealing with the often disputable question of who is an employee...and of course, cases on equal pay.<br /><br />So, for steering you through the complexities of employment law, this handbook is the ideal guide...and, yes, it is the definitive short work for advisers and we expect to see it in most courts and tribunals bookshelves.<br /><br />ISBN: 978-1-903307-69-4st in employment law as at 26 June 2009.

B002JIOQCO|4.0|\\"Dear...\\"a kids review\\",    Im not sure whether you wrote your review just to see what people will say about it.  But assuming that it is an honest review and what you wrote is honestly how you feel...well..allow me to retort sir.    First off...you talk about two other bands that are so great and so original compared to wolfmother in your review.  You speak of the White Stripes as if they are brand a spankin new band.  They have been around since (from what im guessing)you were wearing diapers son. Dont get me wrong, i love the white stripes.  But your comparison to Wolfmother is ridiculous to say the very least!    And then you speak of this band called \\"the answer\\"...as if they are sooo mf'ing original??? I actually took your word for it and looked up this answer band...wow!  You have the freakin nerve to talk about wolfmother and how they try to rip off everyone off.  NO lie...i listened to \\"The Answer\\" and i knew every single drum beat and guitar chord that was going to be played ten seconds before it even came. Very, very, very...predictable and unoriginal.  Sorry sir.    To get on with this review...I will be the first to admit that im not very good at describing how a certain group is good and what it is that makes them good, but I have to say...this cd is verrrry good.    If you heard the first wolfmother cd...this is more of the same, but more evolved.  It seems as if he grew as a musician.  It is still the very best of Black Sabbath and Led Zep combined....but even better that the last one.    If you even remotely like the first wolfmother cd...you will be blown away by this cd. Its five times better than the last one in my opinion.    No...its definitely not groundbreaking or something that none of us have ever heard before...but it is a DAMN GOOD CD!    This cd impressed me alot.  My advice...check this cd out...I dont see how you could regret it!!!
1903307716|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1EX0DICBJJTSR]]ARE YOU INVOLVED WITH PRISONERS AND THEIR FAMILIES?<br />If so, this book is essential reading for you and your advisers.<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />If you are called upon from time to time in a professional capacity to advise prisoners and their families, have a read of Prisoners Law And Practice. You may or may not feel the same way about prisoners -- and prisons -- ever again, particularly if -- unlike many barristers who may have routinely interviewed prisoners in cells as part of their training - you have never been inside a prison and have little or no inclination to do so.<br /><br />Prisoners Law and Practice is one of the latest `adviser' publications from the estimable Legal Action Group which continues admirably in its quest to compile, write and publish meticulously researched works of reference, mainly for professional advisers of those of our fellow human beings who, quite frankly, are desperate; from the homeless, to the unemployed, to asylum seekers and certainly to prisoners.<br /><br />People who find themselves categorized within these groups are vulnerable. Attracting varying degrees of sympathy and disdain from the public, their human rights are all too often overlooked or compromised.  They, like anyone else, require the protection of the law and they depend on the will of others to uphold and sustain it.  As pointed out in the Foreword by Stephen Shaw, Prisons and Probations Ombudsman for England and Wales, `...without law, (in the case of prisoners,) the ever-present danger of neglect or abuse may go unchecked.  `The subtitle \\"Law and Practice\\",' he adds,' is well judged'.<br /><br />Prisoners Law and Practice is an accessible and practical guide to the law governing prisons.  It takes the reader logically along the path of a prisoner through the custodial process, from reception at prison, to categorization and allocation and related issues, to prison conditions and rights while in detention and the various mechanisms for release.  There is a strong focus on prisoners' rights and remedies and a critical analysis of the duties of the state toward those in detention.  Relevant domestic and international case law, legislation policies and guidance are fully covered.<br /><br />However, as Stephen Shaw observes, the book is much more than just a guide to the present state of prison law, it's a work of advocacy, and there is at the heart of the text what he calls an intrinsic belief in the right of prisoners to be treated fairly, respectfully and in a manner that recognizes their inherent vulnerability.<br /><br />To those who would argue that victims have rights and are even more vulnerable, the authors claim that this is a false dichotomy and that there is, or should not be, any conflict between prisoners rights and those of their victims.  `...between the two groups - the issues of openness and accountability (are) at the heart of the concerns of both victims and  prisoners....As with all attacks on vulnerable members of society, the erosion of the rights of prisoners should stand as  a stark forewarning of the general erosion of wider rights in society.'<br /><br />This is a distinguished and comprehensive work of reference for advisers within 12 chapters and 800 pages and it has aimed to reflect the law as it was at 30 April 2009 with the prison population at record levels.<br /><br />ISBN: 978-1-90330771-7s while in detention and the various mechanisms for release.

This quite exquisitely compiled volume in 800 pages is very much, so to speak, its commemorative engraved silver salver, or gold watch following 133 years of service as the highest court in the UK.  A momentous chapter in the history of the UK legal system has now ended with another having just begun.<br /><br />The work is actually a compilation of articles, essays, review and comments by over 40 leading scholars, judges, academics, practitioners and other top professionals from the UK and abroad.  The aim: to provide `a history of the House of Lords as a judicial institution', together with an examination of `its role, working practices, international reputation and its impact on the UK legal system.' The book is in five parts with 40chapters and some important historical information in the 4 appendices.<br /><br />The idea for the book was inspired by, in the words of the editors, `a strong desire to commemorate the achievements of a prominent legal institution in British society and to offer the reader `a rich and diverse range of perspectives on the history, work and contribution of the House of Lords in its judicial capacity.'<br /><br />The publication date was expressly timed to coincide with the changeover of the venue of the court from the Palace of Westminster to Middlesex Guildhall on the west side of Parliament Square - a handsomely restored venue now occupied by the Justices of the Supreme Court and the administrators of the Court following the start of the new legal year in 2009.  So this book is very much a legal history book, and one which all common law practitioners will find informative about an era which has drawn to a close.<br /><br />Limitations of space and the vastness of the topic would naturally result in a necessary selectivity on the part of the editors and contributors as to what to include and/or to omit from this significant work.  The contributors were not able to comment on every relevant House of Lords decision; rather they were for the most part, asked to focus on highlights and trends. The result is a work of scholarship and insight with editorial voices sounding forth from every aspect of the legal profession. It is also great for those students of legal history looking for the occasional comment to enhance their assignments and examination answers!<br /><br />Of course, this is also a mighty work of reference, with Tables of Cases, Tables of Legislation, Notes on Contributors and capacious appendices `intended to be an aide memoire for anyone wanting to be reminded of the sequence of appointments to the office of Lord of Appeal (or Lord Chancellor) and of the background of the individuals in question.'<br /><br />The work is, indeed, a fitting tribute, a commemoration and a valediction to what is now a piece of constitutional history as the Supreme Court grapples with the hard cases from the second decade of the 21st century onwards.<br /><br />ISBN: 978-0-19-953271-1n to a close.

B001AVCFK6|5.0|Definitely one of the best \\"re-imaginings\\" of a past series of movies, Abrams got everything right in this movie.  There is enough Trek Cannon there to satisfy fans of the originals and enough that is different and fresh and new to entertain non-Trek fans.  The casting by April Webster is brilliant...Zachary Quinto as Spock is almost eerie and Karl Urban as Bones is brilliant and Chris Pine brings a freshness to Kirk.  Throw in the utterly appealing Zoey Saldana, an interesting twist with Spock and the amazingly appealing John Cho, and you got a stellar cast.<br /><br />I was expecting very little from this movie and I walked away remembering why I had always liked the original Trek so very much.  I can't wait to see where the series goes from here.
0822208385|5.0|Among the most moving and sadly devastating plays I've even seen. I first saw this produced at Oregon Shakespeare years ago (1980) and directed it first in college (1990) and once subsequently. It will be part of the 2010 season at my current school, though I may be passing direction over to a fellow teacher and just doing the scenic design. It's a challenge to tackle in some high school settings, with only one female role, you need a program that can mount two shows at once to provide opportunities for women. Demographics are also a challenge, as the role of Crooks needs to be handled well and in the less diverse districts, you might be hard pressed to find an actor who can or wants to take on the role.
B000I0QKDS|4.0|Long before he recorded avante-garde techno guitar, Jeff Beck was in the vanguard of the late 1960s heavy blues boom. You won't find any of Jeff Beck's typical whammy bar adventures here, but you will hear a lot of heavy, flashy, and usually tasteful guitarwork that compares very favorably to Jimmy Page's playing on the first couple of Led Zeppelin albums. This will probably surprise Jeff Beck's newer fans, who know him solely in his current context. An even greater surprise is lead singer Rod Stewart's performance throughout. Yes, it's THAT Rod Stewart and back in the day he could belt out soul and blues with the very best of them. He comes very, very close to stealing the show.    There are enough out-takes and alternate versions here to virtually double the original album's length. Usually I can't stand bonus tracks but in this case, almost all of them have something to recommend them. It's nice hearing 'Beck's Bolero' in true mono and with its backwards guitar tagged on as the song's coda, the faster version of \\"Rock My Plimsoul,\\" and an alternate version of \\"Blues Deluxe\\" without the overdubbed audience sound effects. Of course, \\"I've Been Drinking\\" which has a powerful Rod Stewart vocal, should have really been on 'Truth' in the first place. You'll definitely want to listen to these, and they are just as good as the original tracks on the LP. (Avoid \\"Love is Blue\\" if possible).    The best comparison I can make to this CD would be the 'Beano' album John Mayall's Bluesbreakers recorded with Eric Clapton. If only there had been some truly original compositions here - rather than blues covers disguised as original tunes - 'Truth' would be well-known as one of the absolute high points of the late 1960s/early 1970s. How I wish Jeff Beck had held this group together just a little longer so that their sound and songwriting could have developed more. All I can say is, snatch this CD up now while it is still in print and prepare to be dazzled!
B00003W8NM|3.0|Maybe I'm a blasphemer for saying this, but I think Fight Club falls short of being as thought-provoking or surprising as others seem to tout it as. Chuck Palahniuk's stuff in general just does not elicit from me any deep or profound thoughts -- not in the slightest; and Fight Club's pop-profundity is kept simple enough for the masses to digest -- the same masses that this movie seems to be poking fun of.<br />The \\"plot twist\\" or \\"surprise ending\\" is an old and tired one. The first time I started watching it, I turned it off. Not because of the violence (I've been watching Freddy Kruger since I was in Pampers), but because I knew where it was going. When I decided to give it a full viewing, it turned out I was spot-on. Being that so many people hold this movie to be both sacred and clever -- I thought it would be a lot more creative.<br />As-is, the movie is only ok. I enjoyed the contrast between the gritty fight club \\"Superman\\" version of the narrator, to his \\"Clark Kent\\" -- but that contrast was already so clearly defined that it made the ending not only unnecessary, but a huge disappointment. The whole thing may as well have ended with, \\"and then I woke up.\\"

B0000042H4|2.0|Many reviewers have already pointed out the numerous flaws of this recording; of Solti's over the top and classless conducting, of a cast full of big names but with some past their prime, of the orchestra overpowering the singers, of the ridiculous myth concerning the \\"miraculous\\" sound quality of this recording when it is one of the most overproduced garbage of its time..... but ultimately opinions are opinions and not everyone share these opinions, which is why you still see good reviews for this Solti ring. Irregardless of whether it deserves the praises and hype or not. But to me, I cannot understand why people still recommend this as the first Wagner ring, it is at best a flawed masterpiece, one that has Solti's sound written all over it, highly overpriced, cannot be considered an all rounder and ultimately a bad introduction to what Wagner and Des Ring is all about. I don't think it will be fair to sight out Solti, most other rings, from Karajan, Bohm, Keilberth etc have some major flaws and not-so-good singers that pull the set down to varying degrees. One Ring which I find to be an exception and which I highly recommend to anyone looking for his first Ring set is Barenboim's. [[ASIN:B0009BOJSO Wagner: Der Ring des Nibelungen [Box Set]]]. I will struggle to list out any major flaw in it, good conducting from Barenboim, good modern production, and as a whole the strongest cast with no major weak link (yes, Siegfried Jerusalem can't be called a great Siegfried, but he is better than what many give him credit for). Considering that it is much cheaper than the Solti Ring I will give it my first recommendation, you might as well get the DVD but the CD recording is top quality too. An even better deal would be to get this boxset ([[ASIN:B00159679S Wagner: The Great Operas from the Bayreuth Festival]]) which is an absurd bargain and I would take Bohm's ring over Solti's anytime, but for the Ring itself Barenboim's ring is probably the flat out best of all rings.
031606792X|4.0|If you're a Twilight fan -- and I never thought I'd become one, but I am a big one -- this is the book you're waiting for. It won't spoil any of it but the first few pages to say that it begins with Edward and Bella's over-the-top wedding (arranged by Alice, of course) which is equally satisfying as a romantic event and a precursor to lots of awesome vampire werewolf action. Of course, Jacob shows up to the wedding and you can imagine all the craziness that brings.  I love this stuff. I feel like I could read 10 of these books and never get tired of them. I personally think Meyer should keep writing them instead of moving onto aliens. Although I haven't read The Host yet, so I can't knock it yet. Anyhow, fun stuff. I'm going to see New Moon in the theaters this Sunday and I'm fired up!<br /><br />By Jaimal Yogis, author of [[ASIN:0861715357 Saltwater Buddha]]
B0006ZFQP8|3.0|I think that's the best way to describe this Tristan. That Kollo is a ball-less Tristan should be easy to understand, and a common complain about any Wagner he sings. Reading through the other reviews, I do think that's the consensus on his Tristan, and one of the weakest links of this recording. Margaret Price's lacks balls too, as other reviewers have said, she gives a laidback, crystal clear Isolde that pretty much lacks the fire, the anger and the passion that a top tier Isolde brings. But on the other hand, her Isolde is certainly interesting and unique, and when it does work it works very well, that is the case for her Liebestod which is simply the best Liebestod I have ever heard.     But the real disappointment for me is how much Carlos Kleiber's conducting lacks balls, I had previously rated him as a conductor who could do no wrong, but in this case his Tristan is slow, very laid back, very flat and a bit boring to listen to. Blame has to go to the \\"good\\" productions, i.e the usual overproduction in studios that kill the details and realism of a recording. Karajan's Tristan is slow too but to me he did a much better job at pulling out the climaxes and keeping things interesting. Add in the fact that Vickers is a far superior Tristan to Kollo and I feel that Karajan's Tristan is a better choice if you are looking for a laid back, lyrical Tristan to complement the fast and exciting Bohm Tristan.     But as a whole this Tristan is not that bad, it deserves huge praises for its Liebestod, but otherwise I believe that it is a bit overrated thanks to the C Kleiber name on its cover. And not what I would call a top tier Tristan recording.
0786185791|5.0|Kerouac may be best known for On The Road, but this is by far my favorite of his books. Looking back, it has probably been the most influential book on my life. The story is just so  honest and original and beautiful, it confirmed my desire to be a writer when I read it as a sophomore in high school. But not just a writer. It made me want to live my life without shackles, free like Kerouac's character Japhy (Gary Snyder), climbing mountains and writing poetry. It captures the Boho 50's era like no other, especially in the Bay Area. Finally, it inspired me to learn more about Buddhism and eventually spend a year in a Buddhist monastery.

B001KVZ6FW|4.0|I enjoyed \\"Up\\" quite a bit, despite some slow stretches and a couple of obvious plot holes - if Carl is 78 years old, Muntz would be 100+. Production is superb, and the opening segment, showing us Carl's life with his beloved Ellie, is touching and true-to-life.  Once the main story begins, however, things spin slightly out of control; as with all Pixar movies, there's a lot of action for action's sake, even if it doesn't always make sense. Nonetheless, this is a fun movie, suitable for ages 8 and up. I'd give it 4.5 stars if Amazon allowed half-stars.

B00127RAJY|5.0|After reading all of the reviews on Amazon, I was skeptical.  How hard could a 20 minute workout REALLY be?!  I am 26 and pretty active - an hour on the elliptical several times a week, yoga, kickboxing, etc.  I popped in the DVD with plenty of cocky 26-yr old attitude, confident that this would be a piece of cake.  After the first circuit, I was a little wobbly in the legs.  By the end of the video, I could barely walk from my living room to the bathroom to take a shower.  I was soaked in sweat and completely spent.  I had to take several \\"days off\\" since my leg muscles were so sore.  It is an AMAZING workout.  Tough, for sure, but as Jillian herself says, if you want to only work out for 20 minutes a day, you have to make it count.

B000002KHH|5.0|There's different metalheads out there. Those who appreciate all the real metal whether it's heavy as hell, or slower than the heavy stuff. Then there's the fake modern kids who think Black sabbath are too slow compared to the metalcore deathcore crap they listen to. And actually accused them of not having talent. Let me tell you something, Black sabbath are heavier than     Suicide silence, they are heavier than Job for a cowboy, waaaaay heavier than Bring me the hairspray, heavier than life can get. And talent, out of this planet compared to those bands. I'm serious, it's sad how good music got turned into a big scene from all genres especially metal. So you think you're metal? without sabbath there wouldn't be. Any real band you listen to, will always list Black sabbath as an influence whether it's Judas priest, Slayer, Maiden, Cannibal Corpse, Metallica, and even the Smashing pumpkins. Yes they had blues influence but it was NOT blues, it was harder rocking metal. As you should know, there was earlier bands such as blue cheer and even the beatles who first gave us a taste of early metal. But sabbath really was the first heavy metal band. And if you look at my previous horrible reviews, you'll see there was some metalcore deathcore, and probably even some slipknot that I painfully admit i USED to like. Sorry for that, guess i was blinded by that dark force. But without Sabbath there wouldn't be that crap either. Good music also leads to rip off bands who want some money. This is not a review telling you how the music is, because we all know it's insanely good. But telling you you're no metalhead without having Paranoid or not listening to sabbath both Ozzy and dio days. Early days prefer tough. But of course some posers listen to it claiming to be metal but they are really giving a bad name to it. I'm just a metal punk fan who experiments with good music and this is metal!
B002K0WBXW|1.0|Well, Sandra Bullock is a favorite of mine, though I've been very disappointed by many of her films. It's not always her, it's the scripts.  My favorites being Two Weeks Notice, The Net, and The Thing Called Love, in which she wasn't the star, but the film was pretty good.<br /><br />But this, this was about the most boring movie I ever saw.  I kept fast forwarding it, hoping it would get better or thinking about turning it off, and finally it came to and end. Thank goodness.  I put it back in the little box and slipped it down below in the cupboard with other movies I didn't like, hated or some boring re-runs.<br /><br />The plot is ridiculous, made no sense.  The characters were ridiculous and made no sense.  In fact, the whole movie made no sense.  You've probably read the plot somewhere, so I won't bother to run through it, but unless you love bad farce, don't buy it.<br /><br />And PS.  I don't consider this a romantic comedy.

0811826848|5.0|Finally a companion massive book for the cd releases re-introducing the Fab 4 to a younger audience apparently with the blessing of Paul, George, Ringo and Yoko.  This book tries very hard to satisfy the diverse \\"needs\\" of its perceived fan base and so has something for everyone and like most things that try to please everyone, this one doesn't quite succeed and hence the complaints by some of the reviewers here but for me this is overall a great release for the fan.  Granted there are many Beatles books out there some authorised and some not but this one does have a lot of information and for the patient reader is actually a goldmine and for me at least a very fun read.  It is certainly one book that I'll not hesitate to revisit from time to time over the years.<br /><br />Recommended for fans and those curious about what the fuss is all about.
0385504225|2.0|I was pleasantly surprised by The Lost Symbol. In a my-blind-date-was-a-bit- plain-but-that's-good-because-I-was-expecting-Roseanne-Barr kind of way.     Other than that, not by any measure was this a remotely good book. From voices \\"as soft as falling snow\\" to \\"bewildered applause\\" to \\"rocketing\\" SUVs, we're once again assaulted with prose that is clumsy, amateurish, and anything but subtle. The only well-turned phrases in The Lost Symbol are those that are left spinning in their graves.    The plot, such as there was, was both contrived - what luck! all the principals are DC bigwigs; a century on all the clues are still hanging about literally within blocks of each other - and riddled with dei ex machina. Plot twists, when not completely nonsensical, are often (e.g., Mal'akh's true identity) telegraphed chapters earlier than Brown intended. And Brown continues to patronize, hand-holding his readership through even the most obvious points (e.g., the etymology of \\"sincere\\").    Character development is typically Brownian: either underdeveloped (Robert \\"Day Late, Dollar Short\\" Langdon); grotesquely over-the-top (\\"I'm such a work of art\\" Mal-akh'; Sato); or far too dependent on cliche - from night-goggle-wearing, laser-sighted-rifle-bearing, black-SUV-driving, spy-speak-spouting CIA agents (who, at one point needing to commandeer a civilian vehicle, manage to commandeer - wait for it - a black SUV!) to the star of the show: a secrecy-riddled, death-ritual-performing, cabalistic Masonic Order so far out in left field it was hard to keep from guffawing my way through the climax.    Bad acting abounded -- characters were continuously \\"stunned\\" or \\"reeling with shock\\" or \\"recoiling in horror\\" -- and the whole story felt like wading through a movie-of-the-week teleplay, with Dan Brown's (in)famous mini-cliffhangers all ending with \\"fade to commercial break\\".    Nearly every mystery Brown sets Langdon up to solve is nothing more than a cheap word game. Is the Lost Word literal or metaphorical? Brown spends half the book toying with his readers on that point. Langdon finally solves the riddle of \\"The Order Eight Franklin Square\\" when, in a brilliant burst of intellectual acumen, he realizes he's misplaced his comma. And - in an effort to prove that even  punnery isn't beneath him - Brown reveals that squares are not really squares, but that legends are indeed legends. Sort of. (Don't ask.)    Brown's facts, historical and otherwise, are as confused as they were in The DaVinci Code: Falcon 2000s don't have Pratt and Whitney engines; Alexander Graham Bell did not send the world's first \\"wireless\\" message; traceroutes don't do pings; Jefferson redacted the Bible not seeking hidden messages but simple to eliminate the miraculous; the Washington Monument is a) not the highest point in Washington, DC, b) was never legislated to be, and c) was completed nearly a generation later than Brown seems to think; Kalorama Heights (google it) lies south, not north, of the National Cathedral; the conveyor belt system in the Library of Congress has been out of commission for a decade or more; Isaac Newton was never a freemason; etc., etc.    And the preaching! This being a work of fiction, I normally wouldn't mention it. But I had to sit through entire chapters of neo-gnostic prattle so banal and confused it makes New-Ageisms like \\"the secret of the universe is one hand clapping\\" seem like theological profundities by comparison.    And, as noted by many other reviewers, the denoument was so convoluted I'm still not sure what secret the Masonic Order thought it was protecting. It couldn't have been the Ancient Mysteries themselves, as Brown asserts they're preserved throughout the corpus of history's great religious texts. Nor can it be either the Verbum Perdo or its location since, as it turns out, neither was the Verbum ever Perdo (nearly every American home has at least one copy), nor has it ever been a secret that there's a you-know-what buried you-know-where. In short, the biggest Secret of history turned out to be an unSecret. And that, had I been Peter Solomon ready to sacrifice my life and my family, would have left me seriously peeved at the Order.    Now, having said all that, I don't entirely blame Brown for its faults. Both it and The DaVinci Code (like the Harry Potter series) were clearly in need of a good editor. But alas, I understand editors are dinosaurs in the publishing industry, and a good many authors these days are seeing print without their essential services. Brown, apparently, is one (Rowling another).     So, because there was the germ of an interesting idea here that COULD have been salvaged, I give TLS two stars. And that's a shame.
B00000G5WJ|5.0|I had this album as a teenager and watched the show constantly. I am so glad I found this on CD. Amazon was the only place that had it. This music brings back a lot of fond memories.

B002QEXN2K|5.0|Okay, the John enthusiasts out there need to loosen up the reigns a bit.  I was very surprised to find mediocre reviews when I logged on to Amazon for such an amazing piece of work.  I jumped on the Mayer bandwagon around Continuum and to be honest John has always been background music for me but it wasn't until this album came out that I truely think his music is going to become a part of my lexicon.<br /><br />The people who wrote bad reviews are just pissed because they want John to create music that pushes him back into obscurity and they can justify spending money on a pop album.  This album is wonderful, playful, melodic and well thought out.  John should be proud.<br /><br />And one last thing, \\"Assassin\\" is brilliant.

B001AVCFK6|3.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1PT53IANLLU52]]Brief video review of this...movie.  Full review will be up on YouTube shortly (stupid limits).      I had to cut my video review short because Amazon wanted me to, but I had a sentence in there that sums my thoughts up.  This is a good movie.  It's NOT a good Star Trek movie.  That's essentially what it boils down to.    I didn't bother seeing this in theaters because quite frankly, I don't go to theaters to watch movies anymore.  The idea of paying a DVD price to watch a movie with a bunch of other germ incubators, crying kids, ringing cell phones and noisy people is not appealing to me anymore like it was when I was a kid.  Coworkers commented how much they enjoyed the movie, but when they told me that time travel was involved I knew this was going to go down hill very fast.  When the Blu-ray came out I bought it with hesitation - but since I had RewardZone points, it was free, so I didn't lose much, thankfully.  I'm so miffed at this movie that I'm going to just use bullets instead of a long out review.                        = What Star Trek Does RIGHT =    - CGI is quite good at moments.    - Most of the actors did a good job playing the roles they were meant to (but see WRONG below).  - No campy machines like with Nemesis.  - Great quality audio even without TrueHD.  - Zoe Saldana.    = What Star Trek Does WRONG =    - CGI is apparently all they cared about, because the story is severely lacking.  - There was no love angle between Uhura and Spock.  Never happened.  Latent attraction, maybe early on.  But never such a blatant display of affection.  - Chekov looks and acts nothing like the real deal.  That actor was absolutely horrid trying to reprise what Walter Koenig made famous.  - Scotty was way over the top.  Accent would come and go as it pleased, it was clear the guy was not Scottish in the least, and he was thrown in at the end with no real purpose to things.  - Old Spock felt misplaced and added for fanservice only.  - Pikewas way too old.  In the first episode of TOS he was a young, 20-something year old.  If this took place prior to that maiden voyage, there's no reason for him to look that old.  If it took place after that voyage then Spock/Kirk shouldn't have been cadets.  Total discontinuity.    - Presents a \\"what if\\" scenario that totally and blatantly disregards the Star Trek canon in almost every way.      So what does this mean?  If you liked Enterprise you'll probably like this one, because Enterprise in a lot of ways deviated from what made Star Trek famous too, but at least Enterprise had the decency NOT to use true canon characters when doing what it was doing.  For $20 it's a fair price, but if you're a Star Trek fan, don't go in expecting a Star Trek movie.  It's for people who want to see many things blown up and campy stunts.  If you're into that type of stuff this movie will be perfect for you.

B002IYEQR4|5.0|300 was Zack Synder's Spartacus and this film is his Dr. Strangelove - a startling satire on America and it's notion of heroism.  The brilliant book by Alan Moore is one of my favorites, but the film packs a much more emotional punch, especially in the new ending, that doesn't leave one as cold.    The film is not for everyone - don't force the wives or kids to watch it, but for those who let the film be what it is, not what they want it to be, it's a true cinematic masterpiece.    The Ultimate Cut is amazing, and the best version of the film to see.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|The last good Star Trek film was First Contact and Trek in general hasn't been good on TV or in Movies for a long while - this film changes all of that.  It's a Bold, gutsy re-invention of a classic story and the new twists and liberties may turn off some, but most of us jumped right on board.    The film is great, the DVD/Blu-Ray is excellent (no padding, just special features that are worth watching).  I am so happy that Paramount has done such a recent 180 for Star Trek and it's fans - they're actually doing right by us on the big screen and on DVD - hopefully this continues.
1421532255|4.0|This book is, quite obviously, based on the third Death Note movie, also called \\"L - Change the World\\". For anyone who hasn't seen the movies, I'd recommend watching the first two before reading this book, as they present an alternate ending for Death Note and it'd be easier to understand exactly what is going on if you're familiar with that ending. (Or, if you don't feel like watching them, check out the plot from somewhere. Won't be giving any possible spoilers here...)     If you have seen the third movie: this book doesn't follow it too strictly, leaving room for surprise. All the main events are there, but the way how you get from one to the other is a bit different. The characters are basically the same, though some, like the FBI agent, have bigger roles. The Thai boy is missing, and Near is on the background of the story as himself. Misa makes a very short appearance, and also Matsuda and Light's father are seen in the end.     Overall, the book was a fun read. It presents the final case L has to solve before his death, stopping a bioterrorism group who are ready to wipe out... well, most of humanity. I do love L's tricks... you can trust him to be at least one step ahead of everyone else. This isn't any masterful piece of writing, though, and at times things got a bit silly or overly dramatic, but ignoring that, I'd really recommend this book. In fact I enjoyed this a bit better than Another Note, the more popular Death note novel.
B0026P3G12|5.0|The CD arrived an hour ago, and I've already listened to it almost 3 times. I pre-ordered it at the first opportunity on Amazon, and it was well worth the wait. I still find 'I Dreamed A Dream' to be my favorite, but 'Who I Was Born to Be' is right up there.   What a gorgeous voice, and to see her achieve her dream is pure inspiration.  Cannot wait for what comes next. What fun to see her dressed in such exquisite gowns and looking like the beautiful soul that she is.  It makes my heart dance and takes my breath away.

B000002GYG|5.0|This is the first Tom Waits recording I ever heard around 1975 and I have been a devout fan ever since.  I bought this CD as a Christmas present.  He definitely is not a commercial artist and some of his music is an acquired tasted but I would recommend this CD for someone trying to introduce a friend to Tom Waits.  Every song on here is fantastic.  Since it is recorded live, he includes a lot of hilarious running commentary between songs.  I have almost every album or CD he ever did but this is still my favorite.  I wish I could describe his music but the best I can do is to say that his rough gravely voice exudes some elements of blues, jazz, folk all done in kind of Beat Poet context.  Some of his songs are original and some are unique interpretations of old classics.  The perfect CD to introduce someone to Tom Waits.
B002QEXN2K|2.0|WARNING: This is going to be a long one because I have a lot to say.<br /><br />I love John Mayer's music.  I am the first person to tell you how great he is, how closely he can speak the words that I have tried so hard to express for myself (and I'm a writer!)<br /><br />John Mayer has found his spot in my heart since I first listened to his cd \\"Room for Squares\\" so many years ago.  I have followed him and loved him since \\"3x5\\" and \\"My Stupid Mouth\\" and \\"83\\".  \\"83\\" always makes me cry- \\"Here I stand, 6 feet small, smiling cuz I'm scared as hell... thinking 'bout my brother Ben, how I miss him every day.\\" and I can RELATE.  \\"3x5\\" I first listened to while my boyfriend was in the Army.  That song got me through those rough times.<br /><br />Then came \\"Heavier Things\\" which also had a huge array of fantastic guitar picks and lyrics that truly spoke to my heart. \\"Bigger Than My Body\\" is another song that makes me cry.  I am bigger than my body gives me credit for- I'm stronger and braver and worth so much more than my physical stature.  \\"Daughters\\" was a great one too, but even though it was his hit from that CD, it wasn't my absolute favorite.<br /><br />Then came \\"Continuum\\" which continued his wonderful song writing skills and clarity of insight into the lives of people living every day normal lives.  That CD is my absolute favorite.  \\"Waiting on the World to Change\\" is very overplayed, but it still gets me to tear up a little and to feel pumped to make a difference.  \\"Gravity\\" (oh my goodness don't get me started on that one), \\"Heart of Life\\" is a pefect lullaby, \\"I'm Gonna Find Another You\\", \\"Vultures\\"... this whole CD is a fantastic ode to guitar riffs and superior lyrics and great quality of sound.  I was separated from a very long-term relationship, my future husband, when I first heard \\"Dreaming with a Broken Heart\\" on the radio.  It had been four weeks since we had split (at the time) and hearing that song on the radio \\"... you roll out of bed and down on your knees, and for a moment you can hardly breathe\\" made me break apart.<br /><br />So, before this continues to be a review of his OTHER works, I will digress.  Just wanted you to have a background that I may be John Mayer's biggest supporter.<br /><br />\\"Battle Studies\\" has disappointed me.  I had listened to the CD a few times, now, and I just can't get over how much it has changed.  The songs seem like they are all appetizers, with no entree.  The guitar picks are hidden under a huge, useless amount of sounds.  The duet with Taylor Swift is beneath Mayer.  For her to even be featured in the title of the song makes it seem like a publicity stunt because, really, she is not even in the song until the last 30 seconds. (other than a few \\"ooohs\\" and \\"ahhhhs\\")  There is nothing that stands out about this album and the lyrics are mediocre, at best.  The only song that I liked (not loved) is \\"Edge of Desire\\".  In \\"Edge\\", his lyrics are fantastic, but his singing is repetitive and shows no build up and/or desire that he is supposed to be singing about.<br /><br />Even \\"War of My Life\\" which was debuted on YouTube before the album was releasaed as an acoustic during a live show, is now surrounded by so many drums and distracting sounds that \\"War of My Life\\" is no longer a guitar, soul-searching song.  It's distracting so much that now I believe anyone could have performed this song.<br /><br />I love John Mayer.  I would love to sit down and have a cup of coffee with him, and just talk because I truly think that he has an insight into human nature and into life that not many others have.  I am severely disappointed in this album, but I have faith that our John will come back to us again.can hardly breathe\\" made me break apart.

B002RBZ13Q|5.0|I'm a Killers fan therefor i would give this Blu ray a 5/5. But lets get to details,  This is an amazing concert with an amazing performance. This concert really show how good the Killers are at performing live, I'd say that its up there with Muse and Coldplay, probably no one can beat Muse, live wise, but the Killers are pretty darn good.     Minor Complaints:  The killers should really hire better audio engineers, Ive heard versions of Read my Mind live and it sounds a lot better then this DVD's version. Here is one really good recording i found, this is possibly one of the best recorded live performance of the Killers, [...]. I dont know whats going on,they should have more recordings, but nevertheless, i hope The Killers improve their live recordings in the future.    The Extras are good, with the HD Videos from festivals, but the over all depth was just ok, I would like to see more interviews with the band members and stuff like that. I wish people would stuff quality extras into these types of dvds instead of just shoving crap in it.     Oh, and there's no CD in the package, which is a bummer, though it wasnt really that bad cause i got the CD online (in the shady dark corner of the internet), Though i would of preferred having the lossless audio of a CD.     PAckaging wise, it was pretty lame, the Blu Ray itself didnt event have an artwork on it, it was just gray.    But overall, if ur a Killers Fan, then U NEED TO BUY THIS ON BLU RAY!!! It is just great! i had it in my 7.1 cranked up and it was just amazing. The Killers and their great music made up for everything that I complained above.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I am frequently a fan of memory related films that jump around in time and confuse the watcher with present time vs. dreams. This movie is such a great fight for two people who despite their flaws love one another even though they have hurt each other. It sends a message about consequences of actions and value of the people we love. Well written and filmed.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I have been a Susan Boyle fan since her audition on Britain's Got Talent.  To this point, I have been saving Susan's YouTube music videos to hold me over till my pre-ordered Albums arrived.  They arrived today ! One for myself and the others for Christmas gifts. How wonderful to be be able to plug the I Dreamed A Dream CD into my CD player and to finally listen to the fantastic clarity of Susan's beautiful, natural voice.  My favorites are IDAD, Wild Horses, Who I Was Born To Be,  Cry Me A River, Amazing Grace & You'll See, however the entire album is wonderful from start to finish.  Silent Night will get a lot of play in our home for the Christmas Holidays.  Susan is not only an exceptional talent but is also an exceptional person who truly deserves the love and success she is now enjoying.  Wonderful Susan, hope this is only the first of many more albums to come.  Merry Christmas to you in Scotland.
B000L43AN4|5.0|I have been in love with Tom Waits for over a decade and find myself giddy inside whenever I hear his voice despite the fact that his songs a jagged raspy and hard lived. He is a real person and that is what matters. I appreciate his honesty, that he doesn't write \\"love songs\\", that he can tell a story you want to hear and use instruments that are not traditional to the \\"instrument\\" family to make decent music. Thank you Tom. I hope this review brings you tons more sales and  millions of new listeners despite the fact that they have already heard and enjoyed your music in great movies like Fight Club.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This CD brings tears to my eyes. In fact, as my husband was listening to Wild Horses, *he* got choked up. I honestly can say I can't remember a CD ever having this much emotional and (dare I say it?) spiritual power.<br /><br />The recording is so clear, Susan's voice is so pure. She not only hits notes dead on, but toggles and tweaks them in a jaw-dropping way.<br /><br />When my husband and I were talking about Susan Boyle's new CD, we both came to the conclusion that her voice and talent is almost unearthly...as if it were an angel singing.<br /><br />If you like what you here in the Amazon samples and you've liked what you've seen on YouTube or TV, you will absolutely love I Dreamed a Dream.<br /><br />During Britain's Got Talent, Susan told the panel that she aspired to be like Eileen Page. Well, I'm here to tell you that she sounds BETTER than Eileen Page (honestly).<br /><br />If you buy one CD this holiday season, make it this one. In fact, buy it for those you love as a gift, too. It's affordable and, in my opinion, worth much more than the price tag here at Amazon.com.<br /><br />What a blessing you are, Susan!<br /><br />Enjoy Amazonians. I know we are.<br /><br />-- Janet Boyer, author of Back in Time Tarot
B002XSP16A|2.0|Susan Boyle is the now rare individual that has an actual voice, and not just a horrible voice helped by electronics that is popular for mainstream consumption. Unfortunately the studios don't seem to know what to do with this, as though they have forgotten what a real singer is supposed to sound like.    In all of these songs her voice is so over \\"produced\\" with electronic help that it is hard to really hear Susan Boyle over the echos and filtering unless you strain. At the same time, I would have liked to hear something a little more energetic. The selection is eclectic and yet all plays so similarly that it is hard to hear any real difference in the music.    If you are reading this Ms. Boyle we really do love your voice, and do not want to put any more pressure on you, but there is a more capable shining star in there if you would just let it loose.
B000002KCC|5.0|Someone somewhere described this work as a musical Irish wake. That pretty well sums it up.    It's an album that grows on you. It's gritty and depressing and maybe even lots of fun. One of my favorite Neil Young albums.
0307454541|5.0|This is one of the best novels I have read in years.  The prologue sets the stage for rest of the book and with but a few, slow character building pages, the rest just explodes with exciting reading.<br /><br />This IS a book you will not put down once you read past the 20% point.  The author does an extraordinary job of developing the main characters/suspects of a twisted \\"successful\\" family, most living in an isolation.  The most unlikely of characters, including the two sleuths, are meticulously developed and brought together in unusual circumstances to solve the insolvable.  The mood is set on a freezing and relatively deserted island in Sweden.<br /><br />I instantly took a liking to his prose and while not pedantic, did have just the right balance for detail allowing for a smooth read.<br /><br />One of my favorites.  Looking forward to #2 and eagerly await #3.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I was one of the many to pre-order and when I saw her performance on television this morning on her first visit to NYC, I thought I'd need to wait a few more days for the album.  But I was surprised that the CD arrived this afternoon.  Susan Boyle's inspirational music is now in my home and I enjoy the wide variety of music featuring her incredible range of voice.  Go ahead and buy it for yourself or someone you care about.  Amazon will ship it right away and you'll enjoy this amazing gift of beautiful music sung like an angel.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle simply has the voice of an angel. She has the ability to make a song her own.  She does this on her covers of \\"Wild Horses\\" and \\"You'll See\\". \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\" is so uplifting. It is the most well known track here, but there are many other gems here.  My favorite track is the autobiographical \\"Who I Was Born To Be\\". This is a beautiful song.  The entire album is filled with uplifting music.  \\"Daydream Believer\\" is an unusual choice. Susan sings this song in a slower tempo, but it still sounds good.  \\"Cry Me A River\\" is another highlight here.  This is such a romantic song. The piano playing accompanies her vocals here. I love the guitar playing on the track \\"End Of The World\\".  Susan gives a stirring performance of \\"Amazing Grace\\". This is a very moving track. \\"Up To The Mountain\\" is a new song to me.  I like the musical arrangements of this song very much. This is beautiful music.
B002M3SOWO|5.0|I read this series to my 9 and 12 year old boys before they go to bed.  They love it.
B002T9H2MO|3.0|The premise is intriguing, but honestly, if you don't figure out what is going on less than half-way through the film, then you don't watch alot of movies... It is exactly what you thought it would be-the surprise is very minimal. That said, I still enjoyed watching this film, if only for Sam Rockwell who does a wonderful job as pretty much the only actor on screen. He is very believable and fun to watch. The only other 'character' is 'GERTY'-the main computer, voiced perfectly by Kevin Spacey. Usually, when dealing with an artificial inteligence in a film such as this, you are immediately suspicious and are left wondering what will happen. GERTY remained the only true mystery in this film for me.     This isn't a bad film, just not as original as people hyped it out to be. It is extremely predictable, which is unfortunate because once you have it figured out, the rest of the film is not as mysterious for you. At least that was the case with me. Still, I have seen alot worse in regards to this genre.
B001F12J48|1.0|Love, Love, Love this movie, so I decided to buy the 3D version for my kids this year!  This was the biggest waste of money ever!!  The movie picture and color are distorted and the 3D is almost non-existent!  I couldn't watch with the \\"glasses\\", it gave me a headache.  After a while even my 4 and 6 year gave up on the glasses!  They wanted to use the glasses they got when they saw Toy Story 3d, but unfortunately, they did not work!!  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS IN 3D!!!!!!!!
0385504225|5.0|Lost Symbol is a real page turner.  The story is well paced although it does get a bit wordy in the middle. Also at times the story gets rather jumbled between past and present. That said, the setting of Washington D.C. is genius. Considering our economic times, what better way to get Americans more interested in the history of their country.  The story ends with our hero Robert Langdon saving the day of course.  However, the readers own interpretation of the story begins the last fifty pages.  The final chapters will provoke deep thought and controversy. But then, that is what has made Dan Brown famous!  A must read for anyone who enjoys a good thriller.
B002QEXN2K|2.0|I'm a huge fan of John Mayer.  He's one of the few artists I can listen to without fast-forwarding to my favorite songs.  Honestly, I enjoy every song he's ever done...although \\"Waiting on the World to Change\\" from his last album Continuum was pretty lame...but I'll forgive him for one dud and applaud his incredible songwriting, guitar playing and lyrics.  There's no other artist on earth like John Mayer and I readily classify him as a genius.    Having said all of that, I think his latest album sucks.  With the exception of two songs on the entire thing, it's a slow, boring, self-indulged bit of crap without any sense of clever sarcasm that's made his lyrics so appealing all of these years.  Even worse, his guitar playing is kept in check so we don't get to experience any joy out of his uncanny ability to shred.  For example, he covers the blues classic Crossroads but he does it with a wacky, distorted guitar that essentially stomps on the grave of the late, great Robert Johnson.  Why?  Because it has no soul.  If you're going to cover a classic blues tune, you better stick to the basics, wail on your guitar and let your voice weep with the sorrow that is the blues.  On his last album he covered the great Hendrix tune \\"Axis, Bold as Love\\" and he nailed it.  He stuck to the original arrangement but made it his own - an instant upgrade to the classic.  Why he couldn't do the same for Crossroads, I have no idea.    Pretty much every other tune is basically a sappy tale of love lost, only with John you get the feeling he doesn't actually feel devastated by his lost love.  How could he when he's messing around with skanks like Jessica Simpson and Jennifer Aniston and other tabloid tramps?!     Based on the packaging of this CD, with John appearing in glamorous fashion on the cover and the fact that he brought in Taylor Swift to sing background vocals on one track, I get the feeling he's trying to score with the teen market rather than the adults who made him rich and famous.  Seriously, Taylor Swift?  That girl's clever because she's figured out a way to sell millions of albums, but she can't sing to save her life.  What a shameful joke to even have her involved in the project.   With so many talented, soulful women out there...you have to pick her?    In the liner notes, John thanks the core team that has been around him for so long and credits them with helping to create this new album, as though a group of strangers would not afford him the same luxury.  I've got news for you, Mr. Mayer - you need to shake things up and get some turmoil in your life.  Fire everyone who's ever worked for you and challenge yourself as an artist to work with a new production team...one that won't kiss your as* and allow you to write such boring, sappy tunes.    ebhp
B002NXSRVG|1.0|You know it sucks when Marlon Waynes is the most convincing actor in the movie.  Seriously, it was awful....Granted, there wasn't a whole lot to be done with some of the dialogue.  The writers should definitely share the blame here.  Every word from Duke's mouth was warmed-over cheese from better action movies.  Dennis Quaid's character spoke in cliche-ese. And don't even get me started on the women...they could have literally been named \\"Redheaded Good Girl\\"...and \\"Brunette Bad Girl\\" for all the personality they had.  At one point, I thought the movie was actually spoofing it's genre!<br /><br />Thank goodness I didn't go see this mess at the movies...It wasn't even a good rental.  I would say wait until it comes on TV...or until blockbuster is giving away a free copy with every 3rd movie rental, because let's face it, there are gonna be TONS of leftover copies of \\"Rise of Cobra\\".

B0026P3G12|5.0|I watched Susan Boyle on Britain's Got Talent and was amazed that she had the courage to perform in front of a smarmy  audience.  I'll never forget the young woman the camera kept on panning on rolling her eyes.  I wonder what she's accomplished in life.  Good job Susan.  The selection of music was fantastic and your voice was well suited to each song.  You sing with passion and inspiration.  Look forward to your next album.  Thank you for lighting up a dark time and reminding each of us that success doesn't come with an expiration date.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|Okay okay, so it's been censored...kids like her music, they may not understand it (thank god) but they should get to listen to GAGA too...so yes it's been censored but it's still BRILLIANT! Now read on...to what I think of this album...<br /><br />This woman is amazing...people love her and yes a huge chunk of the population hate her (or don't understand her which leads to hate) and of course I do get her and love her.<br />I heard Just Dance like evryone else and didn't know what to make of her, all I knew was that I liked her, a lot, but like, A LOT A LOT! It was a long, hard wait for The Fame to be released...and there was a nervous knee jerk reaction in my thinking that surely it wouldn't be released in Australia....but it was, we don't get a lot of quality power pop american music (thank god for Amazon)....The fame blew me away....<br /><br />I often buy albums and wonder where the artist will go to next, and the waiting to see where they will go drives me nuts, but miss gaga has let us see a small glimpse into her future and it looks bright.<br /><br />The eight track Monster Fame is as good if not better than the original Fame whcih you get as well when purchasing this re-release...<br /><br />It's the same catchy pop, the lyrics that I am sure as sure mean something to gaga, they have underlying meanings many might not want to understand.... I do.<br /><br />Tracks like Dancer in the Dark had to have been influenced by Madonna's Vogue (the spoken celeb rap is a little too familiar)and Alejandro has a distant call of the material girls La Isla Bonita....but all popular music owes something to Madonna...<br /><br />Other standouts are Teeth with it's sexy thromping and also the brilliant and I mean BRILLIANT Telephone with Beyonce...hard to imagine but they go together well and of course gaga isn't out shone...<br /><br />I just saw the concert of this in Australia, we had a massive production of it and I was FRONT ROW...She was mesmorising. The video interludes were almost as good as the live show, I pray that GAGA releases them on DVD, PLEASE GAGA! Your little monsters want them!<br /><br />One helluva clever lady, I've heard people saying that she'll be over in five years (they said that about Madonna too).....Where is she now?<br /><br />On top of the world...eleases them on DVD, PLEASE GAGA!

0345479092|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me, and I found it so helpful with understanding my newborn.  It talks about different baby personalities and understanding their unique needs.  This book talks about not making the goal to stop your baby from crying but to understand WHY they are crying and meet their needs.  This does stop the crying but by solving the problem, not just by shoving a pacifier or a breast in the baby's mouth.  There is even a chart that has basic cues to look for and even different sounds to babies' cries so you can understand what your baby is saying to you.  I am a first time mom and my baby is 3 weeks old and I have learned to listen for and recognize my baby's actual hunger cry, and \\"I'm too hot\\" cry and now know that he grabs his face when overstimulated and needs some quiet cuddling or even a nap.  Which I think is pretty good for now!  This book is full of useful guidelines and tips like this which I have found so helpful.      Some reviewers have been angered by her chapters on breastfeeding/bottle feeding.  I am breastfeeding my baby but know some women who were not able to through no fault of their own.  I think more books should take a more neutral stance on this issue.  And one of my favorite things about this book is that it says again and again that this is YOUR baby and you need to make your own educated choices about how to raise him.  YOU are the parent.  Take all advice with a grain of salt, which includes some of the things in this book.  I am going to recommend this book to everyone I know who has a new baby or is expecting one.

Jodi does an awesome job in making her time point across about how an child who is being made fun of can also be a victim as well. I am forever changed. It has forced me to look at similar situations from every perspective. I think every person (especially children) should read this novel.
B002QEXN2K|3.0|For anyone who happens to be on Twitter, John Mayer is a must follow (along with @MyLathamLife and @NewCDReviews). His incredible sense of humor and lack of inhibition is good for an almost guaranteed daily laugh. What's interesting is that his humor rarely carries over to his music and when it does, it's subtle. Perhaps it's the \\"Adult Contemporary\\" label he's given, or perhaps it's his desire to musically follow in the footsteps of his influences; Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan, and Robert Johnson to name a few. Whatever it may be, John Mayer has been releasing mature, blues-based, increasingly guitar featured music since 1999 with almost always fantastic results.<br /><br />For John Mayer fans, this album is a familiar continuation of the work he has released throughout the decade. Although different instruments are occasionally added to the mix and various styles and influences filter in throughout, the real feature remains his guitar. The first track, \\"Heartbreak Warfare\\" opens with strings fading in followed by delayed guitar reminiscent of U2's The Edge. While these sounds may be experimental for Mayer, they seem to set the mood for the remainder of the album. Following \\"Heartbreak Warfare\\" is \\"All We Ever Do Is Say Goodbye,\\" which has one of the most beautiful choruses Mayer has produced. My guess is he was listening to a great deal of Chicago as he wrote it.<br /><br />Although the romantic Adult Contemporary themes prevail on the majority of the record, Mayer's sense of humor does gently poke through on the tracks \\"Half of My Heart\\" and \\"Who Says.\\" On \\"Half of My Heart,\\" Mayer shares the track with Taylor Swift and sings about loving someone while always looking for someone else. On \\"Who Says,\\" easily one of the best, and most likely one of the most honest tracks of the album, Mayer gives a little insight to his opinion of marijuana use. The brilliant line \\"I don't remember you looking any better, but then again I don't remember you\\" repeats throughout and at the very least produces a smile every time it's heard.<br /><br />For Battle Studies, the concentration is clearly on tone. There is no greater example of this than on his cover of Robert Johnson's \\"Crossroads.\\" For any blues guitarist, \\"Crossroads\\" is almost a required cover, a Fender player's coming of age celebration. John Mayer's cover is significantly slower than Eric Clapton's famous rendition of the track with Cream and resembles Robert Randolph's funk infused style more than the original Robert Johnson recording, but when Mayer opts to solo, the notes are crisp, clear, and distinctly his own. Instead of showing off with notes, he maintains the respect of his followers with the sound he produces from his instrument. David Gilmour of Pink Floyd was famous for the same.<br /><br />Battle Studies may not be John Mayer's greatest achievement, but it's a worthy addition to his already impressive repertoire. With many of his idols still producing music today, it's safe to say we can expect even more great things from this phenomenal guitarist and songwriter for many years to come.<br /><br />Similar Artists: Eric Clapton, B.B.

However I thought the end of the book could have been more clarified as to who was sexually abusing Emily. So there was definitely a few plot gaps but overall great.

B0026P3G12|3.0|There is no doubt that Ms. Boyle has a magnificent voice and this album showcases that beautifully. I just know I won't be playing this CDvery much other than background music because there's not enough variation in the songs. I mean, she even manages to turn Daydream Believer into a stately ballad -- and that's not a good thing. Not everything needs to sound ethereal and dreamy or you run the risk of becoming a one trick pony. She has a great instrument but I'd like to see her change things up a bit the next time.

B001CGJ3QS|4.0|I wonder why most reviewer feel obliged to compare the \\"historical\\" and the newer records saying one is representing the true heritage of Beethoven the other less or not at all. Especially so in the case of Kempff and Andr&aacute;s Schiff. To be honest for one helps just to understand and enjoy the other. And many yet.<br />Compare was not meant in the meaning of distinguish, of course.
B001736FDK|5.0|Great book; both I and my son liked the book.  Interesting characters and plot.
B0029XFN9O|5.0|It's about time this wonderful movie got released properly. I can finally watch it on my widescreen LCD TV. The older DVD release was non-amamorphic and looks awful on widescreen TVs. Too bad Fox never re-released. But it's good to finally see this on Blu-ray...enhanced for widescreen TVs and with excellent picture and sound. The remastered DTS 5.1 sound is excellent. The Blu-ray version looks A LOT better than the DVD. This is one Blu-ray release that was worth the double dip. And just in time for the holidays too.
B002NWRMVS|5.0|I hate to say it, but if this is what it takes to instigate creativity, you should break up more often!  A lot of artists put out albums after breaking up and not all of them release albums that are fresh and are supernovas.<br /><br />As always, Norah shines through with her sultry sounding voice reminiscent of Billie Holiday to give you a feel of her jazzy foundation.<br /><br />Some of the songs on this album are more poppy, alternative rock sounding with effects that some may describe as distorted sound that struck me as a slapping, funky sound.  Love the beat!  I also noticed more of a blues rock sound which I also love.  Perhaps this helps to spit out some of the break-up venom.  Very cool and very Triple A radio format.<br /><br />Some folks say they are turned off by these effects such as heard in \\"Chasing Pirates,\\" \\"Young Blood,\\" \\"It's Gonna Be,\\" \\"You Ruined Me,\\" and \\"Tell Yer Mama.\\"  These are some of my faves on this album.  I dare people to call her snorah anymore!<br /><br />I first heard Norah on David Letterman when her first album \\"Come Away With Me\\" came out and I loved her voice and the country, bluesy, jazz, solid piano music which strikes me as very Americana.  I can imagine her being very popular in Manhattan piano bars.  Indeed very Blue Note.  I would recommend going to see her doing just that.  I think you hear some of this original piano, jazz sound in \\"Back to Manhattan\\" and \\"December\\" so you get a nice mix of a few of her earlier and newer song styles on this album.<br /><br />This whole album went on my iPod for happy running!  This stuff resonates with me yet even more than the first album did!  Congratulations, Norah, on your successful song writing!!  There can't be one, single tone-deaf cell in your God-given gifted body!
B0026P3G12|5.0|Having impatiently waited for this album since I ordered it in pre-release, I was rewarded by its delivery today. Susan Boyle is phonemonal in her performances. My only regret is she wasn't discovered much sooner! This album is a \\"must have\\" for anyone who truly enjoys music.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|I appreciate the fact that this DVD, unlike other Paul McCartney DVDs I own, shows the full concert and doesn't intermingle interview footage. I've been waiting for a package like this for a long time.    The performance here is great, the set list amazing, and it's 2.5 hours long. This is very much worth getting.
B002QEXNDE|5.0|Man, this girl is hot. Sizzling AND smoking. This is only my second venture into Norah Jones' territory, and it certainly will not be the last. She has not only pulled off a seamless stylistic transition, but she is also showing her clout in the recording industry by releasing her latest studio effort in a double-gatefold, 180-gram LP, complete with a full-size poster of her and her five dogs, for the price of a regular LP. Selling 36 million albums last year alone has it's perks!    Music-wise, as with \\"Come Away With Me\\", the fidelity of the recording really shines through, and there is something for almost everybody stylistically. Coming from Texas with a jazz pedigree, her time in New York City has certainly widened her musical horizons. Overall, she is extending her reach a little more into rock n' roll, while staying true to the blend of bluesy jazz and pop that has defined her meteoric ascent into stardom. Reportedly, this is the first album that she has composed on a guitar, and it shows in a good way.     Many will no doubt love the first track, \\"Chasing Pirates\\", as it really shows off her pop music side; it may be the one to really get some top 40 airplay. For me the first one that really jumped out was \\"Light As A Feather\\", which presents a lush aural landscape to show off her bluesy jazz side, which is the aspect of her music that most appeals to me. \\"You've Ruined Me\\", and \\"Tell Your Mama\\" get more into bluesy rock, and she does this very well. There are no mediocre songs on this album, and the wide range of musical styles she presents, while probably short-circuiting many potential 5-star reviews she may have garnered as a more stylistic purist, widen her appeal, and doesn't seem to be hurting album sales any.    Norah Jones has a voice for the ages, there is no doubt about that. There are many industry heavyweights \\"helping\\" her (or is it the other way around?) on this latest effort, which may have helped with this stylistic transition, but comparedto \\"Come Away With Me\\", the album can sound a tad over-produced in some places. But the new rock n' roll edge really shines through elsewhere in the album without being overpowering, and I am looking forward to more explorations into those areas from her in the future.    The LP version of this album is an excellent value for any vinyl-lover, to be sure, even if you only like a couple of the songs. But in my experience with Ms. Jones, the songs I like the most now won't be the same favorites that I develop over time; maybe I will really warm up to \\"Chasing Pirates\\" after all. One of my favorite songs on this album is \\"Man of the Hour\\", which is an ode to her dog(s). Neil Young should be proud!
B001AVCFK6|5.0|EXCELLENT MOVIE. VERY WELL CAST WITH THE GLARING EXCEPTION OF MONTGOMERY SCOTT. PLEASE REPLACE HIM WITH AN ENGINEER NERD, BUT WITH \\"CAJONES, MUY GRANDE).

B002HWRYJE|2.0|Kirk is marooned on Delta Vega. On his way to the Federation outpost there, a big bad snow creature attacks. As in STAR WARS, however, there's always a bigger fish, and one eats the smaller one and pursues Kirk to the only cave on the entire planet with Spock in it. It seems that no one hesitates these days to abuse the willing suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />The new movie has some great and not so great casting. Still, someone who is familiar with STAR TREK should have done the movies. It wasn't an issue of how close they could make it to the older series, but how much different.<br /><br />They should have called it SPACE DEBRIS, or better, GALAXY QUEST, PART II.
B0016PM722|4.0|My son was so excited to get this item.  He had been wanting one for a long time, and we finally got him one for his 10th birthday.  This is actually supposed to be a collector's item for adults, but my son is very particular with his toys and is very careful with it.  However, the lightsaber did not function properly after the first several days.  It would not make the correct sounds and would not even cut on sometimes.  We would take the batteries out and put them back in, and it would work for a little while and then do the same thing.  I called Amazon and told them about the problem, and they were great!  They ordered us another one with no charge and sent it to us within a couple of days.  The new one seems to be working well now.  I just hope it stays that way.  This item is not cheap, so you would expect it to work properly for a long time.  Amazon was very customer-friendly in dealing with this problem.  I would order from them again.
B002NWRMVS|5.0|Norah Jones is one of this decades classiest young singers. She has relied on her talent to sell 3 (soon to 4) multi-platinum albums.     Her latest effort \\"The Fall\\" bring a slightly new sound from Norah. She's not rocking as some reviewer claim. The main difference is instead of being piano based songs these songs are guitar driven. I really enjoy the smooth electric guitar sounds featured in most of the songs. I have always been a fan of electric guitar and am happy that Norah Jones is finally featuring more guitar in her work. On several of the songs Norah herself picks up the guitar and plays the instrument herself. She's a fine guitarist. I especially like the percussion and bass lines in each song. There's a bit more rhythm on this album than past works.    I find this to be a nice development from Norah. It's cool with a focus more on pop-rock sounds.    Favorite tracks:  Chasing Pirates  It's Gonna Be  Stuck  Tell Yer Mama
B002KVSJ64|4.0|With Saturate going under the radar, Breaking Benjamin had to wait for We Are Not Alone to break into the mainstream. Phobia, their third album, rocketed them into the forefront of current rock bands. Dear Agony is more of the familiar, yet solid Breaking Benjamin formula we fans have come to love. Sometimes repetitive (it's true)riffs and lyrics sometimes repeat, but then again EVERY (modern) band does that, I dare anyone to say they don't. It's good alternative rock and roll none-the-less and fans above all will really enjoy it. This band is my favorite band alongside 3 Doors Down, but BB could use a little more experimentation with their sound. I would like to hear some variety in tunings and maybe step out of the box with lyrics too. Phobia may have been their most varied album and gave high hopes for experimentation on Dear Agony, but it fell flat in some areas, unfortunately. I'll probably be crucified for this review, but while the album is good, expect more growth at this point in their career. Any true fan of a band would review the bands art in a honest and sincere way. I'm rooting for this band to start getting awards from the music community that they rightly deserve, especially since Benjamin Burnley truly has one of the best voices and most distinct voices in music today, so good luck in the future and hope this one goes platinum too.
0553381687|4.0|Don't remember anymore when and where it was, but somehow, in conversation, Martin's name came up, and friend of my said something like: \\"Martin is all about clich&eacute;s, but he writes them like they never been clich&eacute;s at all.\\" This one sentence summs up my whole experience of \\"A game of thrones\\", and as I proceed deeper into the series, same one can be said for the rest of it. I'll try and cover my musing from the beginning.<br /><br />Funny thing about me is that I hate and love endless seires at the same time. I started to read \\"Wheel of time\\" long time ago, after fifth book found out that it's completely pointless to continue, and casted books aside for some other time. Meanwhile, Robert Jordan died which kinda settled the matter for me, and I don't think I'll be returning to that series anytime. At the sam time, after 600 volumes of Spider-man, I still find it interesting and fun to read. On the other hand, I can't stand what Kevin J. Anderson does to Dune series but cannot wait for another Discworld book to come out and so on, list is endless. Martin received much prase in my country, as I suppose it did everywhere, but when I saw that he writes 1000 pages long lumps of text I thought to myself: \\"Yeah right, I have better thing to do with my life.\\" Few years passed and I was in a local game-shop, looking for board game to purcahse, and shop-attendant recommended \\"Game of thrones\\" to me. After seeing few reviews on the internet, I purchased it, and got stunned with it. After countless gaming ours (and after acquiring \\"Clash of kings\\" expansion) I decided to give Martin a chance, to see what's that all about. And now I'm hooked, and am one of those people that curse Martin for not spending every minute of his life writing about Westeros. And, despite all of that, I still can say that \\"A game of thrones\\" is poorly written, and raltively bad piece of literature. Wow! Problem with these blocks of text that Martin writes is that you can't really capture them with a glance and single out their \\"badness\\". It isn't as straightforward as that, and as much as it in some places becomes shallow and silly childlish fantasy, in other becomes extraordinary. For example, I'm not sure did Lady Arryn's prison existed somwhere before here, but I'm sure that the picture of it and feelings produced will remain permanent memory, and if I ever build prison of my own it will be exactly like that one. On the other hand, Tyrion Lannister IS Miles Vorkosigan, copied and slightly remade into fantasy setting, but you can't miss it if you ever read one of the Bujold novels. And things like these are what drives man crazy. You can't but like Tyrion because he's so well written, and is gretare badass than any sword-wielder out there, but you cannot go saying: \\"Wow, this is great\\", 'cause you know that it has already been done, in exact way, somewhere else. And, saying that, we have couple of hundreds pages more to cover.<br /><br />Things like those are what makes this book perfect for any kind of analysis. Whether you're aspiring writer wanting to write something that will be widely considered as a good fantasy, or a historian of literature or theoreticist that is digging himself deeper into the genre, you'll have hundreds of details to cover and to bring in order. For instance, same book hold standard adventure-fantasy bunch of clich&eacute;s in chapters that cover Jon Snow, and brilliantly written, first-person voice chapters of profundly stupid character - Sansa Stark. And characters will develop, they will stay inside of certain boundaries, rarely corssing them, but very often they will step up and stop being examples of type. Mixture of high and low fantasy, of knightly fairy tales of ladies and heroes and dark, realistic world of sellswords and informants will lead to interesting clashes, and characters that say bookish sentences will often look ridicoulos enough when compered to more lifelike ones like Tyrion himself, but at every moment, reader will be avare that this type of struggle isn't just one of those postmodern methods for genre destruction rather it holds authentic metaforical value and can be related to real life situations.<br /><br />There is much much more that can be said about Martin and this series from many aspects, and that text would span tens of pages and wouldn't cover all of it, but main point here is that this posibility exist. If you recall some very bad books that you read in your life, you'll remember that you can't say much about them. Neither should you waste your time on it. \\"A game of thrones\\", whether you like it or not (and you won't like it if you're not a genre fan, which in itself can be used for an argument for \\"badness\\" of this book), presents many posibilities and can be read on many levels with many aspects, and that alone makes it worthwhile your time. \\"A game of thrones\\" surely isn't \\"best fantasy ever\\" (Gene Wolfe can eat Martin at every apsect anytime), and surely isn't \\"best book ever\\" but it is interesting and fresh enough and it is worth your time and many. Now, all you need to do is curse Martin and maybe, just maybe he'll finish this series before Jordan thing happens to him.is type of struggle isn't just one of those postmodern methods for genre destruction rather it holds authentic metaforical value and can be related to real life situations.

B00006690G|5.0|I know everyone says the Marshall Mathers LP is the best Eminem album to date I tend to defer. Reason why he seems to have more story depth in his lyrics on this album. Because, of his rap superstardom, personal life, and legal troubles on this album than the Marshall Mathers LP album. Instead of talking about drugs, pistols, fags, his mom and, killing people. Em has tracks like \\"White America\\" Em raises the curtain to his Eminem show album with vengeance talking about the government and his rise and power to raps mountain top. \\"Sing For The Moment\\" and, \\"Say Goodbye Hollywood\\" take Marshall raps to a other plateau. Tracks I can listen to while working out, driving, chores, at work and playing Xbox cause of the endless energy Em brings to the mic. All of Shady/Aftermath/G-Unit production is A+ and the beats on this album go perfect with Em's lyrical content.<br />  \\"Business\\" Marshall comes in on this track like a missed superhero here to save hip hop from watered down garbage mcees. \\"Square Dance\\" is one of my favorite songs on the album Em's flow is second to none other. \\"Soldier\\" I know this track carries alot of weight my friend was in the United States Marine Core said this was a favorite in there platoon in Iraq 2002. \\"Drips\\" featuring Obie Trice raps about catching STD's from dirty sanks. \\"Without Me\\" How boring the rap game is without Eminem involved talking shis. \\"Superman\\" Em raps about relationships with some groupie fluzy's. \\"Hailie's Song\\" Em raps about life and his daughter im feeling it. \\"When The Music Stops\\" nice beat featuring some fresh verses by D-12. \\"Till I Collapse\\" has to be one of Em's best songs he rocks the mic featuring Nate Dogg on the hook. 7 and a half years later and im still playing it thanks Em.

B00004RF97|5.0|One of those movies you cannot help but wholeheartedly adore, `The Philadelphia Story' is filled to the brim with humor, drama, romance and a nice dollop of spunk that keeps it feeling fresh and thoroughly enjoyable from beginning to end.<br /><br />I'm telling you; I'm beginning to wonder why I ever disliked Katharine Hepburn in the first place.<br /><br />The film tells of the wealthy socialite Tracy Lord, embarking on yet another marriage, this time to George Kittredge.  As the big day approaches, Tracy's ex-husband Dexter arrives unannounced with guests, two reporters who have some dirt on Tracy's father.  The proposition is simple; allow the reporters to cover her wedding and the family dirt will stay buried.  She is reluctant, but basically has no choice.  Putting up a front that is easily torn down, Tracy begins to find herself swayed by the advances of reporter Macaulay Connor, a young and naïve man who only wants to expand upon his career.  As the wedding gets nearer and nearer, Tracy's fianc&eacute; begins getting a little nervous, not to mention suspicious, over Tracy's newfound persona.<br /><br />But just WHO is Tracy in love with?<br /><br />The performances across the board are just a whole bucketful of delightful.  James Stewart won the Oscar for his beautifully played comedic performance, but for me it was Cary Grant who really stole my attention.  He really mastered his dapper sense of charm and wit with this one, carrying his character from unlikable to completely adorable with a few well-placed brush strokes so-to-speak.  Katherine Hepburn is just remarkable here, and the entire supporting cast, from Ruth Hussey to Roland Young to John Halliday, is just stunning.  John Howard plays the fool (not `a fool', but `the fool' in the sense of the phrase) very well here, exhibiting a sad sense of misplaced adoration without losing the lacy coverlet of humor.<br /><br />A+ across the board.  Every avenue of this film works (that dialog IS `snappy') and it is one of the best romantic comedies out there.  I totally recommend this one without any hesitation!there.  I totally recommend this one without any hesitation!
B000089RV6|5.0|This album is worth it just for the title track, but all the other cuts are also killer songs....Unless, of course, you don't like hard rock (in which case, don't buy this and see a therapist IMMEDIATELY!!!!)
B002FOQXZK|3.0|I picked up this album because it had gotten some favourable reviews and I was in the mood for something a bit different.  Let me start by saying that the production on the album is outstanding, all of the beats feel right while still being unique.  It really is a shame that the beats were used in this manner though.  There are literally 4 verses of actual rhyme on the album, and 2 of those belong to Kanye and Common respectively (Common's verse is wack btw).      As an avid hip-hop listener I didn't feel out of place listening to this CD, likely due to the previously mentioned production but Cudi delivers most of his lyrics by singing as opposed to rapping.      I don't hate this CD, but it's not rap music.  Purchase with caution and go in with an open-mind and you should be fine.    P.S. This album is neither revolutionary or classic.  It's a nice little niche recording but that's about it.
B0018LMZOO|5.0|Much has been said by critics and non-fans that the Moody Blues were a bunch of hacks who took themselves too seriously.They use words such as overblown and pretentious. In my opinion, the Moodies never spoke of themselves as all-knowing   purveyors of truth and light. The band members themselves have stated in interviews that they were only asking the same questions as everyone else.  They were,in fact, utilizing their craft to ask the questions on a much larger scale than the average person. Every one of the band's albums were questions and musings put to music. Sometimes asking the right questions can be as important as actually gaining the knowledge and recieving answers. It demonstrates a living, vibrant mind. The Moody Blues were (are) a musical group full of inquiring minds.  Truth be told, if we stop asking, we stop learning.  This, their seventh post \\"Go Now\\" album attempts to put to rest the silly notion that they saw themselves as Gurus. The fact that they admit to not knowing all the answers places them squarely in the category of Seeker and not Sayer.  Songs such as \\"Lost in a Lost World\\" states that the singer in just as frightened and unsure as everyone around him. \\"New Horizons\\" confirms that there are new worlds, new Horizons to be found. \\"For my lady\\" does state one unshakable truth: Loving and being loved is in itself an answer to many, many problems and fears. And finally, amid all the other great songs is \\"I'm just a singer in a Rock and Roll Band\\" which takes huge steps in affirming that the Moody Blues are human beings, asking questions and wondering just what's going on. I don't know about anyone else, but to me there is a certain amount of comfort in that. The Moody Blues ask many of the same questions that we do, just in a much more melodious fashion. Seventh Sojourn by the Moody Blues. Good stuff indeed
B002Q4TKAY|5.0|I've never seen the Killers live but really loved this dvd.  I really felt like I was there.  If you've never seen the Killers except Music Videos, you really get to see Brandon engergetically and emotionally sing the songs.  The band is great as well.
B0026P3G12|5.0|It is a sheer delight to finally have Susan Boyle's album entitled \\"I Dreamed a Dream.\\" Although I have heard so many highly talents people sing, Susan possesses a singular genius that I rarely hear or enjoy; she is able to use her voice to communicate all the nuances of the emotions in every ballad she performs. Her excellent diction impresses me as well and if we're lucky Susan will continue to perform for many years to come. The sound quality on this CD is excellent and I like that artwork.<br /><br />There's nothing but very high quality control music here; there's not a dud in the bunch--but, of course, when it's Susan Boyle you write about, it would be tough to honestly say that she could ever perform at anything less than a stellar level. The album starts off with Susan's sensitive cover of The Rolling Stones' \\"Wild Horses;\\" she never lets go of a single superfluous note and that's grand. The lush musical arrangement fits perfectly with Susan's vocals but they never try to steal the spotlight from Susan--she's squarely front and center which is right where she belongs! \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" gets a somewhat different interpretation that she gave it on \\"Britain's Got Talent\\" but it's lovely and it all holds its own very well. In addition, \\"Cry Me A River\\" stuns me with its beauty; Susan sings this to perfection--and beyond! The piano enhances the number as well. \\"How Great Thou Art\\" leaves nothing to be desired, either.<br /><br />\\"You'll See\\" is very poignant; Susan's delivery of this is absolutely faultless. \\"Daydream Believer\\" is another poignant sounding cover of a song by The Monkees; Susan puts her own stamp on this song by playing with the tempo and adding a few key changes--and it works! \\"Up To the Mountain\\" is very memorable; and I really like Susan's treatment of \\"Amazing Grace.\\" I could never tire of hearing Susan sing \\"Amazing Grace;\\" this music and the rest of the CD is all THAT good.<br /><br />\\"Who I Was Born To Be\\" and \\"Proud\\" are two other numbers Susan that delivers wonderfully; and there's yet another gem in \\"The End Of The World\\" which I first heard sung by Skeeter Davis. The album then ends with Susan Boyle performing a marvelous Christmas song, \\"Silent Night.\\" Can we please have a Christmas album next year, Susan? I sure hope so!<br /><br />Susan Boyle's gift is truly remarkable; and we are all better off for her sharing her talent with us. This album is clearly a must-have for her fans; Susan is amazing and I eagerly look forward to her next album.onderfully; and there's yet another gem in \\"The End Of The World\\" which I first heard sung by Skeeter Davis.

B002GYVRRI|5.0|Remastered in DTS 5.1 Digital surround sound, this 1974 release is astounding.  After purchasing, \\"In The Court of the Crimson King\\" in DTS 5.1, I had to get this and it's no disappointment.  Unlike \\"In the Court...\\" this edition doesn't flaunt the surround sound as much, but still makes it sound like you are in the studio.<br /><br />From the complex soundings of \\"Red\\" and the wild \\"Fallen Angel\\" to the more somber \\"Providence\\" the band can be clearly heard with no distortion whatsoever.  Robert Fripp's guitar playing is simply amazing and every track is different in sound, feel and ambience.  It's a real treat to hear different versions of \\"Red\\", \\"Fallen Angel\\" (love the instrumental songs) and \\"Providence\\".  Also included is \\"A Voyage to the Centre of the Cosmos\\", which I did not realize was a live recording until the applause at the end!<br /><br />While the CD is perfect for those who prefer stereo recordings (remastered to perfection), the DVD contains additional songs with videos.  Sure, it was 1974 and there is not much in the way of psychodelia, but that's not the point.  It's the music that matters.  The videos of \\"Lark's Tongue In Aspic: Part II\\" is nothing short of amazing and it makes me want for the album of that name.  \\"Starless\\" is also a standout video cut, with the classical King Crimson song arrangement that is breathtaking.  Sid Smith provides a nice biography of the band with Robert Fripp speaking about pop star status.  This is more than progressive rock.  This edition is a keeper.
B002UXRH10|3.0|I didn't hear great reviews on Rihanna's \\"Rated-R\\"  before it came out. By the sounds of \\"Russian Roulette\\" and by the looks of the promotioal videos and photos, it appeared that Rihanna had changed and so had her sound. I love Russian Roulette and I really like the album. It's a darker side to Rihanna. Some people have said that it's too dark and being that many of the songs aren't catchy, she's likely not to do well with this album. Let's face it, Rihanna has been through a lot in the past year. I'm happy that she is using her music to tell and express what she has been through. It makes me respect her more as an artist. Judging by the songs on the album, you can tell that Rihanna is still hurt but she is trying to get back to a place in her life where she can be happy. No, the album is not full of catchy songs like \\"Umbrella\\" and \\"Take a Bow\\". However, the songs on the album are still good. Her vocals are great and it just shows more of her feelings. I think she took a big risk with changing her sound. Kelly Clarkson did the same with her \\"My December\\" album and many people didn't like it. Although it's a big risk, I think it works for her and I think Rihanna will have another hit on her hands even though it's not turning out to be an instant hit. My favorites from the album are Stupid in Love, Russian Roulette, Rude Boy, Photographs, Te Amo, and Cold Case Love. Also, if I might add, people shouldn't judge an album or an artist just because of the Parental Advisory sticker. If you're offended by profanity, then simply buy the edited version of the album. I think Rihanna will be around for a long time and hopefully by putting her feelings into this album, it is helping her heal. Good job on \\"Rated R\\", Ri.
1591391105|3.0|Meh.    If you're a business student or up-and-coming worker hoping to move ahead, and you've not read many other management books, then this one is just fine. If, however, you're actually in the position of leading a team, I'm going to hope none of these ideas is really new to you.    Watkins offers plenty of buzz words and catchy phrases to help you sound like you know what you're doing (even if you don't). If the material really is new to you, then read the sections so you really do know what you're saying, and follow the advice; it's sound, more or less, and offers enough insight to see you through far more than your first 90 days on a new job.    My biggest problem is that the book doesn't claim to be written for people who hope to be promoted to management someday, but for people who've already landed the job. Assuming you earned your position--and in today's economy, unqualified people aren't getting hired often!--then you should have already encountered every single one of these ideas. There's nothing new or groundbreaking here, just a decent restating of well-known good advice.    On the other hand, if you're teaching a class on business leadership, I'd absolutely recommend this as assigned reading for students. It's accessible and practical, and it offers solid advice.

The insight into what she may have been thinking and feeling was overwhelming for me...I wished I had read this book while she had the disease..so many parts of it rang so true for me, it was like re-visiting that time of my life....and even though it was hard being her caregiver I wouldn't trade those days with her for anything and wish I had known her as well before she got sick! I want my husband's entire family to read this book!!!  As well as my own sisters, children and friends!!!  You'll love it because you love Alice!!!
B002MTTZ5I|1.0|This is ok the first go around but gets very boring after additional listens.  Almost like watching a comedy show where they tell the same jokes over and over.....not bad the first time but boring after.  Not a bad joke/mock band, they have decent musical and singing abilities just boring and no longer funny after the first listen.
B002SYXCVK|2.0|I thought I was listening to Gordon Lightfoot mixed with Stings middle eastern instrumental. This is too strong Irish influence for me to believe it's typical Sting. If I was expecting Irish folk music then that's one thing, but before I read the background it was quite a shock. Sorry Sting, no go on this one.
B00006AW2G|5.0|Had my cd collection stolen once, and I have some stones now but not all the classics, so now they are \\"remastered\\" looking at them here in amazon, as I prefer hard copies, reading all the reviews, and it just doesn't add up, some say they are terrible some say they are amazing!  go figure, I listened to the samples here on amazon and first yea they were tinny and shrill, made me want to pass, as I have some good stones cd's anyway, but I was listening with my ipod issue earbuds well I took out my sennheiser over ear set and the shrillness and tiny sound were gone, I cranked up the volume and it was quite good. Not sure if this counts listening to mp3 versions on amazon, but the tracks, all sound good, I will go forward and buy again, let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers, Beggars Banquet, and possibly Ya Ya's and the double live one.
0811869261|5.0|Ok I just saw/read/pored over this book and I don't know where to begin putting my excitement into words... I'm willing to bet you've never seen a book THAT colorful, THAT sweet and that happy. It's a blissful journey of Mouk through different lands and gives little details about the culture, geography, and foods of that area. It's a brilliant and delightful way to teach kids about different places on the globe. It's so thrilling, that I at my 33 years of age, will absolutely buy one not only for many of the kids I know, but also for myself. This could be a cool gift for a designer friend. It's so flawlessly executed that it will absolutely appeal to artsy, design-conscious adults. The stickers are through the roof as well... So much to play with! So much to learn!
B001DDBCUU|5.0|This movie exceeded my expectations.   It had the same witty dialogue as the TV series and had unexpected twists in the storyline.  My favorite aspect of the movie, besides the fashion, were the characters of course. Each character had her own life and her own unique drama. This made it easy for viewers to relate their own lives to the movie.  A must see!
B002W6Z0UK|5.0|Lady GaGa's \\"The Fame Monster\\" is in some ways an EP, an addition and expansion from Lady GaGa's debut album [[ASIN:B001GM28HO The Fame]]. In other ways, it's a completely new album, simply shorter than the standard album. Regardless, this is good, addictive, dance/pop music. The greatest thing about \\"The Fame Monster\\" is that of the 8 new tracks, none of them sound the same. My complaint with many artist is that it sounds as if they find one song or beat that works for them and find a way to re-write it and make a dozen more 'new' tracks out of it. Not the case with \\"The Fame Monster.\\" Sure, it's only eight tracks long but no track is wasted. Each one feels like an experiment, offering something different style or music-wise.<br /><br />This is one of the few albums that I felt had no real flaws. The only bad thing I can say about it is that, like others, I wish it were longer or had a few more tracks to it. Still, with what's offered, it's a good album. Strong musically and in concept. \\"Bad Romance\\" musically is as catchy and addictive as \\"Poker Face\\"; hard beat, infectious pop, pure dance. The best track of 'Fame Monster' is, in my opinion, \\"Alejandro\\"; it's lyrically catchy, straight forward pop with GaGa's signature 80s/retro vibe. \\"Monster\\" has some odd lyrics but it felt like a fun pop song that, though nothing special musically, is quite memorable with the \\"he ate my heart\\" line being repeated throughout the song.<br /><br />Other noteworthy tracks are the final track \\"Teeth\\" that is like nothing released by GaGa thus far; it's not so much a dance track but it's very tribal sounding with a heavy bass and drum, giving it a primal vibe. \\"Dance in the Dark\\" is straight-up 1980s, even featuring a mini spoken-word part that mimics Madonna's \\"Vogue\\" breakdown. \\"Telephone\\" featuring Beyonc&eacute; has a great 'best of both worlds' vibe as GaGa covers the pop/dance beat and the breakdown has Beyonc&eacute;'s R&B/urban style added in, giving it a very unique feeling. \\"So Happy I Could Die\\" has very suggestive lyrics but it's upbeat and reminded me of a Britney Spears outtake. Finally, \\"Speechless\\" is a ballad done in Lady GaGa's style; no, she doesn't try to hit any high notes but the song is packed with emotion and ditches the pop/dance vibe that makes her songs popular for something a bit more emotionally-driven.<br /><br />In all, \\"The Fame Monster\\" is a must buy for any pop music/dance music fan. If you're a Lady GaGa fan and own the first album, you should pick up this album. If you haven't yet purchased the first album, then buy the deluxe edition that features tracks from this release as well as tracks from the first album (including a few other bonus tracks) [[ASIN:B002QGUFWE The Fame Monster [Deluxe Edition]]].<br /><br />Listen To These: \\"Bad Romance\\", \\"Alejandro\\", \\"Telephone\\", \\"So Happy I Could Die\\"very suggestive lyrics but it's upbeat and reminded me of a Britney Spears outtake.

0375413405|5.0|After seeing 'Julie and Julia' the movie and loving it, I felt that I just had to have a copy of the book. Most of my books are cookbooks and this one certainly holds its place in the collection. It is quite old fashioned and vintagey but has a lovely antique feel about it. Not sure how much I will cook from it (certainly the Bourguignon), but I am very happy to have this piece of history on my shelf.
B002UXRH10|4.0|This is an album that grows on you. Upon first listening to it, I definitely felt somewhat let down by 'Rated R'. The music is not as catchy; nothing leaps out as a Billboard hit like her signature songs \\"S.O.S\\" or \\"Umbrella\\". In fact, Rihanna ditches the pop/dance track and takes on a hip-hop/rock vibe instead. 'Rated R' is a page turner in Rihanna's career; just like the title, this isn't something for kids. There's cursing, there's violence and in many songs it feels as if this is Rihanna's therapy album, featuring moments of the old, sweet, and innocent pop star being hushed and silenced by a vulnerable, angry woman.<br /><br />The Good: After a few listens, 'Rated R' is definitely not a bad album. I heard (like many) the preview samples and clips. Those did nothing for many of these songs. After being able to slip in this disc and listen to each song in its entirety, I can say there's a lot more depth and personality in this than in [[ASIN:B000OZ2CZW Good Girl Gone Bad]] or in [[ASIN:B0009XFJ0O Music of the Sun]]. Considering how much Rihanna has been through over the past year personally, I felt like the 'Rated R' tracks were far more realistic and authentic than her previous hits. There's a lot of variety here and defintely an experimentation with genres and music that hasn't happened before with Rihanna; \\"Wait Your Turn\\" felt like Rihanna's first foray into the hip-hop realm; there's cursing, the beat is driven more so by the beat than the singing but still has elements of a good pop song with a catchy chorus; \\"Hard\\" was Rihnna's attempt at ditching her pop star image for something more hardcore and coarse; \\"Fire Bomb\\" is a violent situation tucked away in a ballad. Not at all what you'd expect from the title. It's very pop and addictive even though it's about revenge. Interesting blend of urban/hip-hop and some hints of 80s music with synths. On many tracks, I could see where life came to influence the music but rather than something whiny and melodramatic, Rihanna dished out some really hard-hitting, unapologetic songs.<br /><br />The Bad: The only real bad thing about 'Rated R' is how starkly different it is from the Rihanna we've come to know up to this point. The album is heavy; it's darker, it's expressively angrier and moodier, it has her cursing and at points being very sexually provocative. It is in many ways ab album about, \\"a good girl gone bad.\\" The change in the image and style was something of a turn-off. While the new image and personality shines through on songs like \\"Stupid in Love\\" and \\"Rude Boy\\", I felt she was trying way too hard to be as far from good and pop star-like on tracks such as \\"Rock Star\\" and \\"Russian Roulette\\". There is some imbalance at play on 'Rated R' that takes it from being entertaining and and interesting revealing of her damaged psyche from being either dull or over-the-top. Certain tracks just felt uninteresting after a few listens including \\"G4L\\", \\"Cold Case Love\\" and \\"Te Amo\\".<br /><br />In all, 'Rated R' is good. There are some weak points to it and a vibe that she was trying a bit too hard to be different from the Rihanna everyone knew and praised before the Chris Brown situation, but the change did her music some good and leaves her at an interesting situation as an artist. 'Rated R' will probably divide the fans; some are really going to like it because it's very different (musically) from anything Rihanna's done before and the chances taken pays off in positive and big ways on some tracks. Some are going to listen to 'Rated R' and want the pop star back who sang sweet and innocent songs like \\"Take a Bow\\" or \\"Unfaithful\\" because that Rihanna is definitely scaled back on this album. I though liked the end product. Not flawless or perfect but it's good. Give 'Rated R' a chance.<br /><br />Listen to These: \\"Rude Boy\\", \\"Fire Bomb\\", \\"Hard\\"dished out some really hard-hitting, unapologetic songs.

THE BOX SET IS GREAT!! THE SOUND IS TERRIFIC AND I'M ENJOYING THE MUSIC OF MY YOUTH ONCE AGAIN.  IF I WAS TO BE CRITICAL ABOUT ANYTHING IT WOULD BE THAT THE CDS ARE NOT EASILY RETRIEVABLE OUT OF THE BOX.  A MINOR ANNOYANCE THAT IN THE END SHOULD NOT MATTER.  ANYONE WHO IS A BEATLE'S FAN WILL ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ENJOY THE MOMENT!!
B002T45VX6|3.0|After picking up \\"She Wolf\\" and listening to it a few times, I have to say that it is (regrettably) my least favorite album by Shakira. \\"She Wolf\\" to me lacks the aggressiveness and sensuality Shakira usually packs into her music. Even when she doesn't sing in English, there's usually so much sexuality, passion and spirit rushing from each track. Yet, in this release, Shakira sounds a bit off. She sounds less sure of herself, she mulls and chews certain words to the point of needing a translator, the music itself feels very anti-climatic. What happened to the music and the artist that brought us hits like \\"La Tortura\\", \\"Where Ever, When Ever\\" and \\"Hips Don't Lie\\"? Sorry to say but that Shakira seems absent on the weak \\"She Wolf\\".<br /><br />The Good: If there's one good thing Shakira accomplishes with \\"She Wolf\\" is that she's trying new things musically. Instead of trying to pull off a sound and album she's already done, \\"She Wolf\\" has a more laid back, light, Earthy/folksy feel to it. \\"Gypsy\\" stands out as a track because Shakira exudes vulnerability and sensuality in the simplicity of the music. \\"Good Stuff\\" and \\"Give It Up To Me\\" have crossover appeal with a touch of urban and hip-hop. \\"Men In This Town\\" has an interesting instrumental backing, sounding slightly electronic, and an interesting breakdown that has Shakira doing a small little rap. The strength of \\"She Wolf\\" is Shakira trying new styles and sounds.<br /><br />The Bad: Her voice is weak on this album. I know English isn't her first language but I never minded or took note of her voice until this album. In certain songs, she doesn't at all sound as if she's into the music. \\"She Wolf\\" stands out in my mind because even her wolf howl is weak. She doesn't put a lot of effort musically into some of the songs, giving the impression that she never connects to some of these songs. Another weakness is that it feels like there isn't much to this album. \\"She Wolf\\" appears three times; album version, live and a spanish version. A mediocre song appearing three times pulls the album down. Adding in a few rappers to make the songs more 'American' friendly didn't always work; \\"Did It Again\\" was all right and though the Kid Kudi version was slightly improved, it just felt like an attempt to sell more albums than to add anything musically to the track.<br /><br />In all, I was let down by \\"She Wolf\\". It feels rushed and though there are some good tracks, the singing and vocals on most of the tracks just feels out right lazy and weak. There are definitely more weak, skip-worthy tracks than there are hits. Buy at your own discretion but I recommend skipping it.<br /><br />Listen To These: \\"Men In This Town\\", \\"Good Stuff\\", \\"Gypsy\\", \\"Give It Up To Me\\"A mediocre song appearing three times pulls the album down.

B0029XFNA8|3.0|No colorized version!  Is this another double-dip version Blu-ray?  The   Miracle on 34th Street (Special Edition) on DVD was on 2 disks, with B&W and a new and beautiful colorized version.  A well done DVD release.     This blu-ray only has the B&W version.  I would WAIT for the Miracle on 34th Street (Special Edition)Blu-ray version release down the road...(2010?) that will have BOTH the B&W and color version.    Movie = 5+ stars  Blu-ray single disk = 1 stars
B0026P3G12|4.0|Susan Boyle's 'I Dreamed a Dream' is a good album. At first glance, it's a bit disconcerting because many of the tracks reveal that instead of taking on original material, Boyle is set to cover some standards from other artists (with the exception of a few tracks). Yet, after listening, you're able to see that Boyle actually adds her own touch and personality to a lot of the tracks. In other words, unlike so many artists who are releasing cover albums, these songs have been re-arranged and mixed to be different from what you're accustomed to.<br /><br />The Good: The best part of 'I Dreamed A Dream' is of course Susan Boyle's voice. She's able to convey a lot of emotion through the lyrics, giving me the impression that this wasn't the ordinary 'covers' album. I was surprised by how she turned the Rolling Stone's \\"Wild Horses\\" into a quiet yet moving ballad. She took on Madonna's \\"You'll See\\", and though it's not as good as the original, she still packs a lot of personality and emotion into the song that shows she made a connection with it beyond just singing the words. Having a proper studio version of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" done by Boyle makes it worth purchasing this album. \\"Who I Was Born To Be\\", the original track on the album, is performed with a lot of emotion and gusto, making it onto my personal repeat list easily. The most enjoyable part of 'I Dreamed A Dream' are the tracks where Boyle is allowed to let her voice takeover and really take ownership over a song, even if it's a cover and standard belonging to a bigger artist.<br /><br />The Bad: My only complaint is that some of the cover songs felt too safe. \\"Cry Me A River\\" seems to be the one song that is included on anyone's album who is covering tracks. It felt a bit boring and expected, even if she does perform it well and respected the classic's arrangement. \\"How Great Thou Art\\" and \\"Amazing Grace\\" also felt somewhat safe and tame, not standing up against tracks and performances like \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" or \\"Proud\\". If she was set to cover some classics, I wish the producers and powers-that-be had been a bit more inventive, finding tracks not covered often that would have allowed Boyle to put her own touch on it and make it her own rather than covering songs that were performed in safe, expected ways.<br /><br />In all, a good album and effort from Boyle. Her voice is definitely at its best on this release and there's a nice spread of songs that offers something for everyone, from pop standards (\\"You'll See\\") to re-inventing classic rock/pop hits like \\"Daydream Believers\\". Definitely worth buying and listening to.<br /><br />Listen To These: \\"Who I Was Born To Be\\", \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\", \\"Wild Horses\\", \\"You'll See\\"e was set to cover some classics, I wish the producers and powers-that-be had been a bit more inventive, finding tracks not covered often that would have allowed Boyle to put her own touch on it and make it her own rather than covering songs that were performed in safe, expected ways.

0823015017|4.0|This is a gorgeous book that is like a college course in color blending.  If you're looking for something quick, easy with simple projects, this isn't the book. But if you want to expand from the typical two color swirl or checkerboard blocks of simple polymer clay medium, this is a fascinating, in-depth study of mixing solid colors into creations that will be totally unique.  I kept back a star only because it's more technical than the average amateur beader's interest. This is definitely for the artisan that wants to further expand their art.
B002R68U7K|3.0|The music speaks for itself; Britney Spears is, despite the ups and downs and tabloid moments, a fixture in the music industry. She's perfected the pop realm with such iconic hits like \\"Baby One More Time\\", \\"Stronger\\", \\"Oops! I Did It Again\\", and \\"Womanizer\\". What's best about this collection is that it features the songs released as singles from her first album through the 'Circus' album. As a bonus, you're also treated to the catchy #1 song \\"3\\" and B-sides/remixes pulled from many of the singles. As a Britney Spears fan, this set is ideal. The music itself is four or five stars since the set features the very best of Spears. What makes this 'deluxe' set flawed is simply the price and concept of a collection containing all of her 'singles' in one box.<br /><br />The Bad: With the retail price tag of almost $100, and even with the Amazon.com discount, I expected a lot more from the deluxe edition of the 'singles' collection. After all, just a few weeks ago Jive released a single disc edition of the this same 'singles collection' [[ASIN:B002R68U7A Britney Spears: The Singles Collection]]. So, what makes this different from the standard edition? A box, an individual sleeve containing the original cover art of each single. A DVD containing 26 Britney Spears music videos. For $100 and a title like 'the singles collection' and a picture showing covers of her singles, I (as a fan and consumer) expected the full, un-abridged SINGLE, meaning the original mix of each song (which is included) and the numerous remixes or B-sides that were originally released with each single. Instead, the original mix of each song is included (just as with the standard edition) and just one B-side or one remix from the original single. What exactly is the point? Just five years ago Jive released Britney's [[ASIN:B0006284JQ Greatest Hits: My Prerogative (Limited Edition with Bonus CD)]], [[ASIN:B0006FO8RA Greatest Hits: My Prerogative]] and [[ASIN:B00064AM62 Britney Spears - Greatest Hits - My Prerogative]], almost the exact same concept (minus the B-sides/remixes from the singles), and with almost the same track listing with the exception of the songs from [[ASIN:B000WQ9UA8 Blackout]] and [[ASIN:B001GO09MI Circus]].<br /><br />To me, this deluxe 'Singles Collection' is a huge rip-off and ploy by Jive, not Britney Spears, to rake in more money during the holiday season. Why not include more original songs? How about including hard-to-find tracks or cuts that didn't make it onto the albums (including \\"Amnesia\\" from 'Circus' that was never formerly released in the U.S. or \\"Kiss You All Over\\" that was cut from 'Blackout' would have definitely made this release more valuable). Instead, we're treated to a few B-sides that have been available for years now and remixes that are easy to find online, even purchased and downloaded separately on sites like Amazon.com! This is nothing more than an expanded edition of \\"My Prerogative: Greatest Hits\\", made to include tracks from 'Blackout' and 'Circus'. The price is outrageously high not because of anything special musically but more so for the packaging. I definitely felt the DVD design and execution was superior on \\"My Prerogative\\" as this collection's videos are just slapped onto the disc with none of the special angles, special features and such that came with the \\"My Prerogative\\" video collection.<br /><br />The Good: The B-sides, mainly from Britney's first two albums, are definitely a nice bonus to this set. They are crisp, remastered and musically offer a lot (instead of all of the auto-tune she plays with now, the early B-sides feature a simpler Spears taking a stab at singing about love, heart ache and teenage angst). The remixes included are good, even though some of them are not the true best remixes from the singles. Another good thing I can say about 'The Singles Collection (Deluxe)' is that it's nice to have a DVD that has a lot of the recent videos (though it would have been nice had it included \\"3\\").<br /><br />If this was a true celebration of her decade in the business, a lot more effort could have been put into this set. There's nothing deluxe about it other than the price tag. There are a few extra tracks not included in her last greatest hits album and there are some B-sides and remixes gathered in one place/collection that makes it only slightly better (but far more expensive) than \\"My Prerogative\\". But, in the end, this is an overpriced, flawed released. 30 discs - 29 containing 2 songs EACH, many of which even a casual Britney Spears fan will already own. A DVD (the 30th disc) that contains the music videos, but many which don't warrant shelling out $70+ (I mean, are the videos for \\"Radar\\", \\"Break the Ice\\", \\"If U Seek Amy\\" or even \\"Gimme More\\" worth the purchase? These aren't Britney Spears at her best).

Radarcelebration of her decade in the business, a lot more effort could have been put into this set. There's nothing deluxe about it other than the price tag. There are a few extra tracks not included in her last greatest hits album and there are some B-sides and remixes gathered in one place/collection that makes it only slightly better (but far more expensive) than \\"My Prerogative\\". But, in the end, this is an overpriced, flawed released. 30 discs - 29 containing 2 songs EACH, many of which even a casual Britney Spears fan will already own. A DVD (the 30th disc) that contains the music videos, but many which don't warrant shelling out $70+ (I mean, are the videos for \\"Radar\\", \\"Break the Ice\\", \\"If U Seek Amy\\" or even \\"Gimme More\\" worth the purchase?

B001PO53IO|5.0|You know if you troll through the boards at [...] site, you'd probably come across all those lifeless fanboy clone war haters. Well let me tell you, this set is just phenomenon. You really get a very serious appreciation of how this series was made and the work and the effort that has gone into it. This cartoon series is a cut above the rest. This is not your regular 2-d cartoon and some of the stuff is failry new and pioneer. But this series has chock full of action, story and adventure. This set was just gorgeous and if this was just the first season, imagine season 2 and beyond.
0061719544|5.0|As one who used to surf right past 'The Late Late Show,' I recently found myself stopping to look and listen. Craig's guest was Billy Connolly, the Scottish actor/comedian and they were discussing Craig's new book. I have long enjoyed Billy's outrageous humor and find it not unlike Craig's. Their discussion was very interesting and so funny that I ordered the book the next day. It's hard to believe that a man who had sunk so low and lost so much through multiple addictions could pull himself together and become a sober, productive member of society. His first step toward recovery was when he finally accepted the fact that he \\"couldn't drink and he couldn't not drink.\\" That was when he sought help. When he had  been sober for a while, he was incredulous the first time he realised he was actually having FUN without having had to drink,smoke,or snort anything. It is not a preachy book so I think alcoholics and drug addicts might well find, as Craig did, that life can go on happily without these artificial props.      Craig is a master of the double entendre and his language and humor are quite irreverent, but somehow not offensive. It makes me think that perhaps laughter IS indeed the best medicine, because this book, though sad in part, made me laugh out loud more than once.
B002SJIO5E|1.0|I saw this movie when it came out in theatres. I fought the urge to get up and leave thru the entire movie and when the end came I really wished that I had left. That is two hours of my life I will never get back. Don't waste your time on this movie the whole documentary style filming was just irritating and distracting. If you have two hours to waste I would use it doing something else.
0446560065|4.0|I liked this book, some parts made me laugh. I think that this book should have been called \\"Simon's cat: backyard fun\\" or something similar. I say this because the Simon's cat cartoons deal mainly with Simon and his cat whereas in the book the cat spends a lot of its time in the backyard and/or messing around with other wildlife (and his gnome buddy). Not that this is bad, but I kinda hoped it would be mostly about Simon and his cat like the cartoons are.     Even though it is a quick read due to the fact that the book has no text (the communication is mostly conveyed using body language and facial emotions) I would still say that this book is worth a read.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|This film really blew me away. More of a reboot than a prequel (which the franchise needed after some rather skimpy box office returns with the last few Star Trek films), this one does not disappoint. Director J.J. Abrams & crew hit the reset button on the entire Trek lore & go back to the beginning. We get to see Kirk's father George sacrifice himself to save 800 lives, which simultaneously, ushers in the birth of James (a \\"life in the shadow of death\\" metaphor). The film smartly shifts back & forth between the childhoods of young Jim Kirk on Earth & young Spock on Vulcan, an interesting contrast between two individuals out of control & seeking understanding in their lives. All the key characters eventually intersect at Starfleet Academy, in which, three years into their training, a galactic emergency arises that whisks the cadets off on to their first mission on the Enterprise. A deep space mission that unfolds a dangerous tale of genocide & revenge.   The look of ST is quite breathtaking from scene to scene, and it's obvious that the cast & crew wanted this film to have an epic feel to it, which it certainly does. The action barrels through the film like a juggernaut, but wisely, doesn't skimp on story or characterization. And this young cast of newcomers have amazingly captured the essence of their already-familiar characters. Chris Pine is fun as the wrecklessly ambitious Kirk; Zachary Quinto turns in an unerringly measured performance as the internally conflicted Spock; Zoe Saldana gets a more expanded role than her predecessor Nichelle Nichols did as the assertive Uhura; Eric Bana as the film's baddie, the enraged & vengeful Romulan criminal Nero...well, I could go on & on about the cast. They all did terrific jobs. And did I mention the great Leonard Nimoy plays a key role in the story? I won't spoil it for you!   Great special effects; great performances; great writing, producing & directing. And the familiar ST humor & thrills. This one has it all! So grabyour popcorn & soda, because even if your not a Trekkie, you're still going to have a blast watching this flick!
B002UXRH10|5.0|This ones coming straight from the heart and what she has gone through this past year and some. I love the part when she said \\"my nick name is you idiot\\", I may be dumb but I'm not stupid! You have to admit WE have ALL been here before!
B0026P3G12|5.0|I was delighted to receive this CD in the mail late Saturday, thank you Amazon! My husband and I listened to it together and we both thoroughly enjoyed it.  The quality of her singing on CD is so much better than what we heard over the internet. There is a variety of genres - and I wonder what other genres Susan still has up her sleeve.  It's hard to pick a favorite track, each one has it's place.

B0026P3G12|4.0|Although Susan has a beautiful voice, I was a bit  disappointed with some of the arrangements such as \\"Daydream Believer\\"  and \\"the End of the World. Included are some gospel songs   (I'm not a fan of gospel music). Other than the title track,  I particularly enjoyed \\"You'll See\\", \\"I am Who I was Born to be\\",  and \\"Proud\\".  She also did a nice rendition of \\"Silent Night\\"    Over all I would rate this CD 4 stars.  If a 10 star rating had been an option, I would  have rated it an 8.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This album lived up to every bit of my expectations! I quite enjoyed the slow tones of \\"Daydream Believer;\\" it was quite a different treatment of one of my favorite songs, and everything else was fantastic. I can't wait for the next one!

B000UJ48UO|5.0|Not a review, just a word about aspect ratios.    A lot of movies in the 80's were shot in a \\"soft\\" or \\"open matte\\" format, which means they were shot full frame (1.33:1) and later matted by cinema projectionists to fit the screen (remember that cinema screens used to be much more disparate in size and ratio than they are today). This practice also facilitated transfer to home video, since the negative was already in a full-frame format. It is a huge falacy that all films were shot in a \\"fixed\\" or \\"closed matte\\" format and then later panned and scanned for home video. You'd be surprized how many movies were actually shot full frame and soft matted in the theater (Schindler's List and Top Gun to name but two). The thing to remember when regarding movies shot in the seventies, eighties, and early nineties (or every Stanley Kubrick movie ever made) is that \\"widescreen format\\" or \\"theatrical aspect ratio\\" is not always synonymous with \\"original aspect ratio.\\"    The original aspect ratio for FMJ is 1.33:1.  The 1.85:1 version presented here will fill the entire screen of your 16:9 television, but it will do so by cropping out the top and bottom of the original frame.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|Still getting used to the slow-plodders. Best songs on this affair are:    All The Right Moves  Secrets  Good Life  All This Time  Marchin' On    The one song I don't care much for is Everybody Loves Me. I truly believe that Tedder/Onerepublic will blow us all away on their third, to-be-epic release. They'll smash Viva La Vida, I think.

0385341008|5.0|This book goes well with hot chocolate and some cookies. It's a playful, fun, lighthearted read that on occaision injects (lightly) the horrors of Nazi occupation. It is very well written, and the characters are lively and entertaining.<br /><br />I enjoy the british-style of humour, and the british (well, back in the day, anyway) style of the \\"stiff upper lip\\", that seems to have gone missing from the UK recently. It's on full display in this book. This is, at its heart, a sweet love story, and it is done very well. Some critics here have called it fluff - I suppose if you're a Hemingway man, who needs RED MEAT in their books, and lots of MAN-STUFF - then yes, it is fluff.<br /><br />But it isn't sugary-sweet fluff, like fairy floss. It's more, well, a delicious mango chicken curry. And now i'm hungry. I liked this book - it's more for people in an emotive, happy love story type mood, although admittedly the change in author towards the very end does affect the flow a teeny bit. But it's minor, and at the *very* end of the book.<br />Someone else mentioned the Book Thief - it's a good book too, you should also read it. Both books are very different though - this is a love story, the Book Thief is more focussed on the horrors of Nazi Germany, with the associated emotions (spoiler alert! Not Happy Ones). But don't skip this book for that one. Unless you're in a Hemingway or a Conrad mood (and there seem to be a few people here who need to feel \\"raw emotions\\") - then read<br />anything by Elie Wiesel. I'd start with [[ASIN:0374500010 Night (Oprah's Book Club)]].<br />...<br />There, now you're all depressed - oh, you need cheering up? - i'd recommend[[ASIN:0385341008 The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society (Random House Reader's Circle)]] to cheer you up. And some hot chocolate.
B00168OINK|5.0|Everything about this movie is outstanding... story, animation, humor, action, etc.  And Blu-ray is the best way to watch it.

B001OQCV24|4.0|I love disaster movies....i dont look for what makes sense or not...but if<br />its eye candy without the boring subplots, im a sucker..and ill watch it.<br /> As the movie is not out on DVD yet, this review is for what i saw at the<br />theatre... Nice to see it on a giant screen, you could see the details of<br />whole neigbourhoods going down the cracks created by the earthquakes...giant<br />skyscrappers comming down.  So if you like this kind of stuff, i do<br />recommend this movie. 4.5 stars
0439023483|4.0|Set in a bleak future where the United States has fallen into a dismal ruin.  As a punishment for an earlier rebellion each district has to send a boy and girl to the Hunger Games.  A fight to the death bloodsport event that everyone is forced to watch.  The book follows Katniss Everdeen who volunteers in place of her sister to fight in the games.  And that's the plot.<br />The writing is very good.  Suzanne Collins does a nice job of spinning the narrative into a tense and bloody story.  While the basis of the book is simple and straightforward it does a good job of fleshing the characters out.  Even adds a little romance to the mix.<br />The only downside I found to the whole thing is it is book 1 of a trilogy!  Which I didn't know when I began reading it.  So you can imagine how annoyed I was at learning it was to be continued.  Oh well, sign me up for book # 2!<br />I have also read online that there is a movie in the works based off this novel.  So do yourself a favor and pick it up.

A wicked scene I can still see clearly is when one of the astronauts gets stuck outside the shuttle, you'll know the part I'm talking about. This movie is a must see, especially because Cillian Murphy is in it.
0525421033|2.0|This was a beautiful story but I found it really boring for the most part.  It's sad but not sad enough to make me wanna cry.  I thought it was going to be like The Lovely Bones but it didn't really measured up.  The best thing about this book was the ending....I loved how she ended it with a lot of good and touching quotes at the end.  Did you also know this book is being turned into a movie....I look forward to it.  I think it'll be better than the book for some reason:-)
B002LE6XR2|5.0|My box set arrived today and luckily despite Amazon's deplorable packaging it arrived in good condition.<br />The lamp, which is attached to a plastic base or platform feels a bit cheap to the touch and is made from a plastic composite.<br />Having said that once adjusted and placed on the shelf it looks spectacular.<br />As mentioned in previous reviews it runs on four AA size batteries and seems to be lit via small leds. It omits a soft glow rather than a harsh light (were you to use a conventional globe).<br />The base also houses a handy adjustable shelf which you can slot your various blu-ray cases.<br />It's larger than I envisioned and despite the cheap Chinese build, it's a centrepiece that I'm sure will impress all that view it (just don't let anyone play with it).<br /><br />As long as you can purchase this and pick it up (would not take the risk with shipping) I would recommend it and if you are a big Pixar fan this item is the ultimate keepsake.<br />Just like their movies which evoke emotion, this item will bring a smile to your face every time you glimpse it.<br /><br />As far as the movie itself is concerned I can't really add anything that has already been stated in all the sterling reviews that have been posted however I will add that when I went and saw this at the cinemas some families left due to the high emotional response that their children had to some events throughout the movie. I don't want to give anything away but there were at least two points in the movie where children actually started to cry!<br /><br />Something parents need to be aware of is that this Pixar offering is designed to be an emotional ride for the senses and that some children may not be fully equipped to deal with this at a tender age. It may definitely warrant a discussion on life after the credits have rolled. Not necessarily a bad thing.
014241493X|2.0|All these \\"good\\" reviews are giving me second thoughts.  I couldn't even finish the book.  I read it to halfway, hoping it would get more interesting but it never did.  I found the characters to be unbelievable somewhat because even though they're teenagers in high school, they didn't \\"act\\" and \\"sound\\" like high school students to me, but a much younger version like in, say, middle school.....Now i'm thinking if i should have read it till the end, hoping it did end better.
B000V86OKG|5.0|The second season of \\"Dexter\\" is arguably even stronger than the first.  In particular, it avoids the three main debits of the debut season by (1) making Deb a much stronger character, (2) including fewer flashbacks with Dexter's father, and (3) avoiding a melodramatic season ending.  The season focuses mostly on Dexter's attempts to avoid capture.  Unfortunately for him, the remains of his victims have been found, and he's been dubbed the Bay Harbor Butcher (a sobriquet he hates).  The FBI is asked to assist the Miami police in the investigation, and Sergeant Doakes becomes even more suspicious of our favorite serial killer.  Everyone seems to be nipping at Dexter's heels.  Plus, in an amusing sideplot, he's having problems with Rita which leads him to start attending NA(!) and picking up a sponsor, the very creepy and overly sexual Lila (Jaime Murray).<br /><br />As in Season 1, the plots and situations are not always wholly believable and rely on quite a bit of luck.  However, the writing continues to be very strong, and the characters really gel together in this season.  The series continues to use its dark humor very effectively, especially as things spin out of control for Dexter.  I especially loved the brewing hatred between Deb and Lila.  Season 1 was a bit of a slow burner for me; it took me awhile to get into the series.  In contrast, Season 2 starts off exceedingly strong and remains of high quality.  I definitely want to dig into the Season 3 episodes on DVD and see what happens next.
B0015AARJI|5.0|When Sony came into the video game scene many years ago with the PSX aka PSOne, they created one of the best controllers ever made.  The shoulder buttons are very comfortable and easy to press within a split second, great for games that require fast reaction time.  The four face buttons are spaced perfectly, and the overall design of the controller fits the hand perfectly.  Sony hit the bulls-eye with the PSOne Dualshock controller, and they transferred this design over to the PS2.  The design was still so popular that Sony could not resist transferring it over again.  The added benefit of the dualshock controller on the PS3 is the added freedom of wireless.<br /><br />The controller is easy to adapt to for Sony console veterans, making the upgrade to the PlayStation 3 even less painless then it already is.  The PlayStation 3 sticks to Sony's winning formula, utilizing familiar buttons, and the same layout as controllers before it.  Players will easily recognize the mapping of the controllers, with trademark \\"square\\", \\"triangle\\", \\"circle\\" and \\"x\\" buttons that Sony fans have become accustomed to.  The PlayStation 3 also follows the tried and true method of the Xbox 360 controller by placing a \\"home\\" icon on the controller.  The \\"home\\" icon is located in the center of the controller, and upon pressing it the player will view the PlayStation 3 XMB.  The XMB is the main navigational source for the PS3, displaying the contents of the console's hard-drive and disc-drive.  Holding the button down for a longer period of time will allow either the controller or the console to be turned off remotely.<br /><br />The controller easily syncs with the console and has a great battery life as well.  The controller also comes packaged with a USB cable that you can use to charge the controller with in case of long gaming sessions where the battery may begin to run low.  The only drawback with this is the length of cable is not long enough to actually allow the gamer to sit at a decent distance from the console while charging the controller.  Replacing and upgrading the chord with one of a better length is a wise choice, and one that I highly recommend.<br /><br />The Dualshock 3 returns to the heavier weight that players are used to feeling from the controllers; ditching the lightweight design of the Six Axis.  This makes the controller \\"feel\\" better to hold, making it sturdier as well.  The major reason that I prefer this controller overall the other controllers that have been released is because of the directional pad.  The d-pad is perfect on the Sony controllers.  It allows for precision and accuracy in every genre of gaming.  I was disappointed when Sony launched the PS3 and its controller lacked rumble capability, however, with this new release the Dualshock design is back and better than ever.the console while charging the controller.

B001U0O8H0|2.0|Ok, whatever happened to the boys from Dagenham, Essex, England.  The answer lies in this limited edition of Sounds of the Universe.    Martin Gore, Dave Gahan and Andy Fletcher have are all grown up, but  somehow still look cool in Raybans and leather. As most fans of DM   know they all reside in the USA, for touring, studio and financial  reasons.[re-Baron Kessler Management] In 1988 Depeche rocked with   such energy.[Rose Bowl, Depeche Mode 101 and a little earlier Music  for the Masses.] 20 years later they emerge with World Trade photos,   2 LP's and new technology.    Unfortunately the missing link is still Alan Wilder, who replaced   founding keyboardist Vince Clarke. If you listen to Martin Gore's  solo work, the synthesizer work never could be at Alan's standard.  Hence the melodrama continues. Andy Fletcher, only played bass  chords...and so the story goes. That left Dave Gahan out front  without the brilliance of Wilder. Also Daves' heroin addiction  did not ease the situation.    Nevertheless, Sounds of the Universe is one of the Top 100 CD's of  2009. Altogether Depeche mode have sold in excess of 100 million  records. However \\"Sounds\\" does not have the bounce and verve of  earlier work...but they tour all the time..including a tour to  promote this record.    Come on Martin, lets give Dave something to dance to! Fans of  the 'Mode'need the adrenelin rush of black leather and sunglasses,  Second time around....
B0001VV1GK|5.0|I'm looking to buy the revised version of this product. Both are pictured on the Amazon listing. (Check out the different elevator designs in the different views.) Anyone know what you get if you order right from Amazon? The built in elevator or the one that's just attached to the side? Thanks!
B002BU0DPE|5.0|I got my pre-order of MW2 on release date... my wife couldn't sleep that night. After researching dozens of ps3 headsets, I finally settled for these because many people said \\"Perfect for Call of Duty\\". They were absolutely right!!! You can hear your enemies closing in on you.... every foot step, every reload, EVERYTHING so damn clearly that it's almost like a Universal Studios ride.     Yes... there is a hissing. I was concerned at first but after actually listening to it, it's NOT A BIG DEAL! I compare it to listening to your boombox or computer speakers... you can also hear a slight hissing on those but after the music starts, you'll forget it's there. Trust me... the sound that this baby does will blow you away. The mic is perfect too!! Noise cancelling and you can hear your own voice so won't yell at the mic. It's very comfortable; I wore them for 5 hours straight (I wear glasses) and it never bothered me.    Even though most people are gonna be broke this holiday (Assassin's Creed 2, MW2, God of War Collection, Uncharted 2...) try to make a little budget for these. You will enjoy all those new releases (and old ones too) x 100. Totally worth it!
1596680199|5.0|There are tons of polymer clay books out there, but this one has more BEADS than any of the others. It has so many ideas, it's unbelievable. Almost every type of technique is covered, so there is something for everyone. I had purchased lots of books before this one--they are no longer needed because this book covers everything in those, and then some!
B000002GC2|4.0|i like all the tracks on this album, but my favorite it track one, Al No Corrida. classic quincy jones.
B001GCUER0|5.0|Times have changed - or have they?  Mad Men continues to be a gorgeous, glossy and unsettling portrait of a pivotal leg of our journey to becoming the nice but nasty society we are today.
B000AP04FG|4.0|i enjoyed this movie. it was funny and full of action. lots of chemistry between brad and angelina, which did help their performance be believable.
B001KP2Y3K|5.0|If you are a fan of her previous CDs, you will be delighted by Madeleine Peyroux's CD Bare Bones.  I had heard one or two of the tracks on our local jazz station, KBEM, and went to Amazon immediately to sample the other tracks.  Of course I had to buy it and certainly was pleased with the CD when it arrived along with a book which I had also ordered.  If you like the easy drawl of singers like Bessie Smith or Billie Holiday, you will love her singing.  You will also enjoy the original material found on this album.
0800130936|4.0|great movie. loved will and martin. some parts were kind of over acted by both of them, but still a good movie.
0765356139|4.0|I'm not quite sure why everyone is complaining about the boring plot line and static characters of this book. For one, look at the length and realize that it'll take you a while to read.  Don't like long books? Don't bother.  Don't like series books?  Don't bother.    What I love about this series is the plot.  Sanderson is great at crafting a plot for his stories, regardless of action or not.  The first book, granted, had a lot of action, but you also knew what was going on in the world - there was no element of chaos and things didn't need to be solved for the most part. They needed to be done.    The second book, loads has to be solved and figured out.  It's not Intensity, granted, but it's also not a volume of the Encyclopedia Brittanica (not dissing the encyclopedia in any way either...but I would want to snuggle up to read it).    Gave this book to my friend, who reads a lot, and I mean A LOT of books from this genre, and he really enjoyed it without me really saying much about the plot itself. He wants to read the third one, so whatever Sanderson is doing he's doing it well.  Sorry the six or so of you that don't get it.
B0002234LS|4.0|i really enjoyed this movie. the twist in it is like WHOA!. a must see.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|Okay, I love most british films, most romantic comedies, and find often something redeeming in the ones I don't. This movie is a huge disappointment. I was drawn in by the great actors, but I wonder what drew them in. This movie has weak story lines, mostly unlikeable characters and uses every opportunity to include foul language, sex and nudity it can. The effectual message? Love Actually is Cheap.
B002UXRH10|5.0|I've never been a fan of her or her music, but this CD is surprisingly good and well put together, with what look like true emotions. Great effort, hope she continues with this new direction.  Favorite songs: Hard, Stupid in Love, Fire Bomb, Cold Case Love, The Last Song.
B0026P3G12|5.0|To the person who gave this album one star, and says Susan needs a different manager because the selections are disappointing: Did you read the review on Amazon? Susan hand selected all of these songs because of their personal meaning to her. She has this right! After the hand that life dealt her, to rise above all expectations and share with us, humbly and gratefully, the amazing gift that she is, she deserves this and so much more. Maybe the next album will be more eclectic and to your liking. I loved every note, every word of this one!
0385532458|1.0|This book was a huge disappointment to me.  I thought some of the stories might tie in with A Time to Kill but they really didn't other than a casual mention of Harry Rex Vonner.  Why is it set in Ford County?  I have read several reviews that said the stories were funny and they laughed out loud.  I found the stories depressing and most of them made me cry.  The only good thing I can say about this book is that it only cost $9.
080017948X|4.0|I do not like this DVD much. My husband bought is for men' retreat. For what he needed it was good.

B000OLGCI4|4.0|This dvd is not as good as #2. My daughter is OK with it but prefers the other one when the girl and the little boy comes along.
B000JLPMPS|5.0|Upgraded from dvd to blu. Beautiful picture and sound. Love this movie and now its even better.
B002T921AC|5.0|Justin is obviously harmless. Not sure why these adults are commenting like that...apparently they haven't been following him. He means no harm if you have been watching behind the scenes and other videos you would know. I'm not even sure he realized the lyrics would make an adult cringe. Though he obviously wanted teenage girls to listen. Now that Im thinking he is probably aware that his voice may be a little high-pitched so he tried slippin' some not so good lyrics in to sound older. Personally I say there is absolutely NOTHING to worry about. He's adorable and I will watch hom forever. I have been trying to find tickets but he is going to some very random locations. You cannot go wrong with this CD. He is a born star. I love you Justin &lt;3 Keep it up! =]<br /><br />Go to [...]<br /> to find out how he responded to his \\"world being centered around young love\\"<br /><br />I love him =]<br />He makes my heart cry &lt;/3
0823023494|5.0|I just got through with this book and I have to give it a few words. While remaining kid-friendly (i.e. if you're looking to do pinups of busty babes, look elsewhere for full depth guidance on the upper torso area) it gives a LOT of information in a relatively small amount of space. As with any book about drawing, this book will not create a story and characters for you, however, it does give you ideas to get the ball rolling. One thing I like in particular is how they follow along throughout the book with a continuous assignment about the made up characters described in the first chapter. If you follow along, and actually do the revisions and find the one that's \\"right\\" then without realizing it, you've already begun the process for your own characters. As i went along, I started to mentally drift from what was in front of me as they described it and was thinking steps ahead to my own characters I wanted to create and applying the principles to them. This book covers a few different drawing styles, and though it doesn't go into depth for each style, it points out the similarities for personalities and how they are captured regardless of the style you use. I've used a few different drawing books before, and some were great for action and such, but with a focus on personality, I feel like this one really nails it. If you truely experiment with what you're given here, I don't think you'll be disappointed. I've just started sketich up different people again and already they all look different and like they could really have their own story as opposed to me putting different faces, expressions, and hairstyles on the same \\"template\\" of a head.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|Buble's repertoire of covers of classic melodies has expanded, but this album contains a few original songs that are going to start a wave of new demands for his voice.  Perhaps the next album will have more original songs than covers, and then maybe he can record an album of songs that he's written.  His performance on Dancing With The Stars showed his excellent voice, but he looked too subdued compared to his live interviews on talk shows.  Nonetheless,  the new album will not be a disappointment for its baby steps toward expanded horizons.
B000002A46|5.0|This Christmas album by Mariah Carey is a classic. I did not even realize that many of the classics played on the radio every season such as, \\"All I want for Christmas is You!\\" and \\"Christmas (Baby please come home)\\", were even Mariah Carey songs! I loved how the album had a gospel feel to it. Mariah made the songs her own even though she made the classics such as \\"Silent Night\\" traditional. I recommend this CD to anyone who is looking for a holiday album and does not know which one to buy. I give this CD five stars!
B002QB1910|5.0|I have to confess, I have been listening to this album all weekend since I found it online early and I have to say that this is the best album to date. The other albums I used to skip a lot of the songs because to me they sounded like filler but this one is good from beginning to end. I feel that there is a more mature person behind the lyrics and that is a good thing. The songs that stand out to me are Russian Roulette, Stupid in Love, Rockstar 101, Fire Bomb and G4L. I am sure that because this album is parental advisory there are gonna be some disgruntled people on here soon complaining but we have to remember that Rihanna is older and have the right to make any kind of music she wants and never claimed to be a child advocate. Lets keep that in mind and really listen to this album because it is really a masterpiece. Bravo, Rihanna!!
1400049628|5.0|This is a really fun book.  I purchased it as a Christmas gift but started to glance at it.  I was instantly hooked and had to read the whole thing myself.  The author has really put some thought and time into this.  Enjoyable and informative.
B002QW7ALM|1.0|I just watched \\"Pandorum.\\" Not sure why I'm telling you this, since it was nothing to write home about. Hope the cats are OK. Oh, how was your knee surgery? I'm looking for a new roommate because Sara the packrat is moving out (thank god). I'll see you over Christmas. Can't wait to take grandma to Disneyworld one final time before she shuffs off her mortal coil. I know that sounds morbid, but it's true, isn't it?<br /><br />Love,<br /><br />Your son
B002NXSRX4|3.0|The title for the review says it all. The over-use of computer animated graphics made this flick somewhat cheesy. If you can stomach this problem, the movie itself is pretty cool & the characters are pretty good as well. The acting is only so-so, but it is what you would expect from a movie that is not loaded with A-listers. The plot was somewhat predictable just as it was in the animated series back in the 80's, so that is fine. The fake new technology/weapons in the movie was very cool & made for an interesting storyline. As long as the Baroness comes back for the sequel & is once again clad in pleather....I will be watching it.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Wow! All I can say is WOW!  I had no intentions of buying this CD until I heard Susan on The Today Show.  I then listened to all the tracks on the Amazon site.  I bought the CD and LOVE it!
B002CMLIJ6|4.0|when i ordered the product i thought i was getting a blu ray edition..........i was wrong....might have been my fault but i was dissappointed
B002NWRMVS|1.0|I love Norah, don't get me wrong.  All her other albums are favorites.  But this one, like they said, is very different.  Where is her piano?  Where is Norah - - it doesn't even sound like her!  The songs themselves really stink.  BORING.  DULL, like others have said.  I sure hope we haven't seen the last of Norah, and that she comes to her senses and makes more albums like her others.  This one is a HUGE MISTAKE!  Where's Norah?
B0007GFFVQ|4.0|Decent remaster but why the changed order of songs? I had the original (stolen in the 90's) and will forever hear M386 as the opener followed by Aragon etc.  So I ripped the cd and reordered the songs as in the original, otherwise the universe is upside down for me.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan has a nice vocal quality that is immediately recognizable.  In \\"Wild Horse\\" her voice sounds a little like Barbra Streisand, yet it is more pleasant.  My favorite is \\"Silent Night.\\"
B0026P3G12|5.0|I got my album today, have played it through about 4 times, I am not at all disappointed in any track on the album, it's just beautiful!
B001GCUER0|5.0|Excellent product.  It was here before I knew it!  Product was in excellent condition (like new) at a very reasonable price.  I would buy from this vendor again in a heartbeat.
B000001EAQ|4.0|The harder and faster the band drive their beat and themselves, the more compelling I find them.  There is only so much innovation available in rock'n'roll yet Bono/Edge manage to find new territory after the hugely successful Achtung Baby.  A decade has past and this album is holding up well.
B001OQCV24|3.0|Ronald Emmerich is the new Irwin Allen.  The biggest difference is at least, in even the hokiest of his films, he still managed to lure major movie stars: Steve McQueen, Paul Newman, Michael Caine, Faye Dunaway, William Holden, et al.  But this is a big, loud piece of entertainment.  Yes, it is hokey.  Yes, the dialogue is stilted and it is utterly unbelievable and the end is right out of Pal's WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE.  Take it on that level and you'll be fine.  Look for anything more and you obviously entered the wrong autotorium at the multi-plex.  Is it just me or is this the comatoste performance by Danny Glover ever?
B002W6Z0UK|5.0|So much's been said about Lady GaGa this past year, her provocative fashion, desire to shock and uncanny ability to create a killer hook which included five US Top 10 singles by now. Then there was the comparison to Madonna, Christina Aguilera and Gwen Stefani.<br /><br />The truth is Lady GaGa makes darn good electropop music and she is not ashamed of it. There's no hiding behind the art or talk of being eclectic. The Fame Monster is not so much a breakthrough but a showcase of GaGa's talent of creating catchy songs. Bad Romance, while unfairly compared to some of her past hits, is a stomper, the sort that belongs to a fashion runway. The big chorus and somewhat erratic vocals speak of the joys of a bad romance. Other standout tracks include the celebrity-name calling Dancer in the Dark with all its electronic stutter (and we haven't heard such stylish name calling since Madonna's Vogue). Then there's the insidiously infectious Monster and So Happy I Could Die where GaGa sings about loving that lavender blond and touching herself. Of course, Beyonce pays a courtesy call on Telephone, a sort of a followup to their collaboration Video Phone, but ten times more danceable and catchy. Then there's the sole emotional ballad, Speechless, which by the end, would have left one wondering if GaGa had sung about brokenhearted self.<br /><br />The Fame Monster continues where The Fame left off. I only wish it were longer. B+
B0025KVLSI|5.0|Of all the Beatles albums, this one may the most misunderstood. George's jangly Rickenbacker guitar and the moody quality of the Lennon-McCartney originals on this outing, coming at the end of their 1964 teen-pop explosion, not only looked forward to the elegant folk pop of the following year's more refined Rubber Soul, but seemed more than any other of the early recordings in the Beatles catalog to have launched the entire second wave of the British invasion and its American (and global) counterpart, from the Byrds to the Kinks to early Bee Gees and Cat Stevens. It's the most Crosby Stills and Nash of all the Beatles records, and I think I know which way the influence was flowing. To ears also attuned to the DIY ethos of punk and New Wave, to Nick Lowe and the Smiths and Galaxie 500, as well as the obscure twee and indie pop of the 1990s, the Beatles for Sale LP also slips on like a familiar sweatshirt. All in all, it's a hugely important record stylistically, easily the most enjoyable of the Fab Four's first four albums right down to the entertainingly quirky choice of cover versions, and \\"Eight Days a Week\\" is just one dandy pop song, one of the tastiest morsels in the entire Beatles candy box. Beatles for Sale is easily my favourite of the group's albums until they came to full rock-and-roll flower in 1967 and after, when finely-crafted studio albums from Sgt Pepper's to The White Album knock it out of the water. Still, if this sweetly moody little record were the only thing the Beatles had ever sold, I'd still buy it.
B002XSP16A|5.0|Ms. Boyle is unaffected and exemplifies the hidden abilities in all of us. The variety of music makes I Dreamed A Dream a personal glimpse into a unique soul, but one that is typical of all of us.  The signature song immediately makes us picture the YouTube event, but also reminds us of our own dreams and what we make of them.  She brings emotion and feeling to each of the selections and showcases her gorgeous voice beautifully. The production avoids the tendency to show off technical bells and whistles that overshadow the artist.  The lack of adornment and Susan's performances make us want to slow down and really listen to (not just \\"hear\\") the music and consider the messages therein. Hopefully this is just the first of many for Ms. Boyle.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I was not a Trekkie when I first saw this movie. I had watched some of \\"The Next Generation\\" with my mom when I was a kid, and I knew who the characters from the original series are as well as some of the events from that series, but that was pretty much it. And I still thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The action scenes were incredible, the acting was phenomenal, and I really felt myself drawn in to the characters and the story. Everyone was in character but still managed to expound on the canon, and I particularly liked how the scriptwriter and director treated Spock. I cannot possibly recommend this movie enough-- it was a fantastic reboot to a legendary series. It got me to see the original series in fact, and after watching that series I really feel that the actors captured the personalities of their predecessors perfectly. Yes, there were a couple of plot discrepancies, but I didn't even notice them until long after the movie was over, and those differences are negligible in my opinion. Overall, it is a great movie.
B00064ADR0|5.0|SECOND WINTER, Johnny Winter's second album (excluding THE PROGRESSIVE BLUES EXPERIMENT), is even better than his incendiary debut, as such great tracks as \\"I'm Not Sure\\" move him towards a form of psychedelia, and he, bassist Tommy Shannon, and drummer Uncle John Turner continue to be an American version of Cream. Every professional person or caring friend who, in trying to help me, cited Winter, who's visually impaired, as proof that people with disabilities can achieve great things was absolutely right, as the songs on this remastered double-disc set prove. The remastering is warm and thick, so you feel that you're actually in the room with Winter, Shannon, and Turner as they're playing. Winter would make even better records with Rick Derringer, but this was him at his rawest.
B002NWRMVS|5.0|Have never been a big fan of Norah Jones, but let me say this is a stunning work. Certainly one of the best records of the year and should be a winner at GRAMMY time.
B002WLTI62|5.0|I purchased this album today. I have never purchased an album by Shakira. And I must say that I am very pleased with my purchase. She appeals to all audiences with this album. Whether you like latin music or hip-hop, this album will not disappoint. I highly recommend it. Especially:     Did It Again (Featuring Kid Cudi)  Why Wait  Give It Up To Me (Featuring Lil Wayne)  She Wolf    I predict her winning grammys for this. Thank you Shakira, for making good music !
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|I cannot say enough about the latest Batman movie, The Dark Knight directed by Christopher Nolan.  The combination of the acting, mise-en-scen, and cinematography all amalgamate to provide the viewer with spectacular artistic images, excellent portrayals of characteristic ideologies, and as well as a thrilling psychological plot.     The acting led by Christian Bale and Heath Ledger is only to be followed by an outstanding all star cast including Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, and Aaron Eckhart.  Bale continues his role as Bruce Wayne and his alter ego Batman for the second time after his initial success in Batman Begins.  No matter how great of a performance Christian Bale put out there for the audience, his acting will forever be overshadowed by that of Heath Ledger who died shortly after the making of the film, and thus this movie will forever be known as \\"the role that killed Heath.\\"  Christopher Nolan and Heath worked tremendously together capturing the essence of the half serial killer, half chaotic sociopath adding tremendous depth and complexity to the Joker not seen in the original comics.  The only weak point in this cast in my opinion was Maggie Gyllenhaal who replaced Katie Holmes from the previous film.  She looked old and out of touch with the whole Bruce Wayne and Rachael Dawes typical comic love affair, but simply their chemistry on stage did not coincide.   The Mise-en-scen of The Dark Knight refers to everything on stage (the props, sets, costumes, and acting), and was mainly the brainchild of Nolan's brilliant thinking.  Combined with the cinematography or how the movie was filmed (lighting, camera angles, camera movement, etc.) Nolan creates stunning visuals for the two and a half hour saga of good against evil.  The film itself contains many long shots and astonishing background and inversion camera clippings creating stunning visuals on the big screen.  The set seems to be jammed packed with props and intricate details that the viewer can reallyappreciate.  Many resent the fact that it is over one hundred and fifty minutes long, but actually on the contrary I believe it adds to the overall suspense and to be frank any shorter of the movie would undoubtedly fail to do justice to the actors and plot of the film.     In conclusion the viewer should buy this movie for the action scenes, excellent examples of great directing, an all -star cast, not to mention the fact that it was Heath Ledger's last film ever.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|It has been said plenty a time before, but...well...the folks at Disney and Pixar have done it again. \\"Up\\" is, perhaps, their most charming, touching, and exciting animated feature yet - at least in my opinion. If there is a fulfilling movie for all the family, this is surely one. \\"Up\\" comes in a fabulous package that includes both Blue Ray and DVD copies of the film, plus a Digital Copy.    Early in the film, we meet young Carl Fredricksen, who dreams of embarking on an adventure trip to South America, just like his hero, Charles Muntz, a famous adventurer.  Carl meets young Ellie, who also has the same dreams and aspirations. Carl makes a living by selling balloons, and eventually falls in love, gets married to and ages together with Ellie. Unfortunately, they are not able to realize their dream of going to Paradise Falls, in South America, due to lack of money. Sadly, Ellie passes away due to old age, and Carl is left alone in the house that he shared with his one and only love. Some time after this sad episode, Russell, a young explorer, knocks at his door. He claims that he needs to get a badge for assisting an elderly person, so that he can earn the title of Senior Wilderness Explorer. After being pestered by Russell for a while, Carl agrees to help him, and gives him some work at his yard.    One day, just when Carl is about to be forced to move to a retirement home, he attaches thousands of balloons to the foundation of his house, creates his own makeshift blimp,  and flies away, to everyone's surprise. He doesn't realize that Russell was at the porch of his home by the time his house took off. Initially angry at the kid, Carl unwillingly accepts his uninvited guest on his trip. After some time, too, Carl learns about the need of love that Russell had, and takes him under his umbrella. Together they will embark on an unforgettable journey, which will include storms, exotic wildlife, talking dogs, and in which they will meet an unexpected ghost from the past.\\"Up\\" is a beautiful and colorful movie, with great, true values and feelings. It's about life, aging, death, and friendship, and I'm very sure that it will reach your heart and the best of you. This fascinating set includes four discs. Disc One is the Blue Ray with the feature film, plus extras, like the theatrical short \\"Partly Cloudy,\\" alternate scenes, a making-of documentary, and more. Disc Two is another Blue Ray, loaded with more extras, such as a multilayered geography game, eight documentaries, and much more. On the other hand, Disc Three is a DVD copy of the film, also containing some extras. Lastly, Disc Four contains a digital copy of the film. Released November 10, 2009.

0684833395|5.0|This book is total satire and irony concerning WWII, combined with a dose of sobering morality along the way.  This book will make you will laugh, and just maybe, cry. Perhaps old WWII vets may not enjoy reading this book, but I certainly did.  Only down side was the open-ended ending, leaving the reader with no clue what happens to Yossarian.  However, it showed what a strong, unyielding character Yossarian was.  I would rate this book as one of the top 10 I've read.  Lots of rare vocabulary words--have a dictionary at hand.
B0025VLEM0|5.0|You know from the opening credits that this movie is going to be a classic.  The 3 headed zombie beating to the Queen song is one of the greatest scenes in the movie.  Hilarious and clever throughout.
B002QW7ALM|4.0|(No Spoilers Here)<br /><br />Pandorum was really a pretty decent flick. It was by no means a perfect movie, but probably one of the top 10 Sci-Fi films of 2009.<br /><br />The basic premise (this plot was really fun as it untangled itself, so it's difficult to describe without any spoilers, but here it goes):<br /><br />The main character (played by Ben Foster, from Bang Bang You're Dead, and \\"Angel\\" from X-Men) wakes up with Dennis Quaid on a ridiculously large space ship, after being in cryogenic stasis for many years.<br /><br />The problem is that being in stasis for so long causes severe disorientation, so the two officers slowly remember who they are, their jobs, their mission... and, they're locked out of the bridge for some reason.<br /><br />As their memories slowly come back, and they discover a few more passengers, they realize there are huge problems with the ship and the crew - some stasis chambers are empty, the bridge appears to have been sabotaged, life support is failing, and the other officers cannot be found. But the biggest problem -- there is something or someone on the ship who may be killing people.<br /><br />Are they aliens? mutated humans? a saboteur? As the small crew try to run for their lives and solve the mystery, they begin to realize that the cargo they're hauling may save humanity itself.<br /><br />This film was very reminiscent of [[ASIN:B001RTCP1A Pitch Black]] - a small crew facing desperate odds, in the backdrop of a sci-fi setting. It was also reminiscent of [[ASIN:1558908323 Mimic]],  [[ASIN:B000BUNZY2 The Cave]], and [[ASIN:B000Y7U98C Sunshine]] by Danny Boyle, another great yet under-appreciated sci-fi movie.<br /><br />There were lots of plot twists - nothing terribly brilliant, but enough to keep you interested. My biggest complaint was not enough lighting in certain scenes, just too dark to see what was happening in 2 or 3 key scenes. But overall, fans of the above-mentioned movies will definitely appreciate Pandorum. Lots of action, lots of suspense. Not too scary - a pretty well-rounded movie.unded movie.

B0012K1ILW|5.0|There are elements here of the typically grounding/healing, watery and spiritual Baduizms as well as some newer, more aggressive flavas in place (a la \\"Mama's Gun/Worldwide Underground\\"). The packaging says it all and there's an awful lot goin' on in that afro of hers.  Amazingly, it's all been put to music.  The message here is at times frightening, but real and the beats make it even more urgent. There's a spoken interlude (from a sci-fi movie from the 70's), and it's unsettling to the point where I have trouble listening to it when I'm alone because of its highly paranoid inflections, but after all is said and done, the panic is lifted by the hidden bonus track and hit single, \\"Honey,\\" which comes in with its emotional rescue to lighten things up a bit. This is some serious, serious stuff and can leave one feeling a tad disturbed,(but no less awakened) as it IS rather different from the Badu norm we're all used to.  This is more like social commentary set to music and it very craftily addresses some of the current day's woes (and other familiar issues).  The insertion of \\"America\\" into her name (Amerykah) is absolute GENIUS!  She is one of those rare artists who paints from the depths of her soul and splashes the masses with more than just the typical colors in the spectrum.  Her choices of paints are funkier (and better) than that and I salute the excellence of her artistry.  This album is a rare gem in a sea of less impressive, empty, current day crap which is saturated in \\"looks\\" and Auto Tune.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|The Fame Side..  This is one of the best purchases i made this year. This is as close to POP perfect as your gonna get. Lady Gaga delivers the goods on every track. It's nice to see a new artist deliver the goods. Lady Gaga delivers the goods and the beats are insane. They are so beyond the realm of addiction! Get this CD if you wanna dance, party, & have a good time! One of the best albums of 2008 for sure!    The Fame Monster Side...  1 year after she burst on to the scene she is back with a new album 8 new tracks and for those who thought she would be a flash in the pan artist ha!  This album defiantly has legs of its own to stand on.. From beginning to end she rocks it out and all I really have to say is.. Britney who?
B00003CXD5|4.0|This is the film that features the famous \\"badges\\" quote parodied in \\"Blazing Saddles,\\" not to mention by most every one in every American company that requires a badge.  The line in this movie is as follows: \\"We ain't got no badges.  We don't need no badges.  We don't need no stinking badges!\\"  It's spoken by an actor named Alfonso Bedoya playing a bandit named \\"Gold Hat.\\"  The actor dominates each scene he is in, coming across as quite intelligent despite a set of bad teeth.  He actually looks like the genuine article (as I perceive it, anyway), as though plucked right out of that location and era.<br /><br />The key characters in this movie are all grimy and swarthy, just what you would expect from down-on-their-luck gold prospectors in 19th-century Mexico.  Everyone plays his part well in this feature, from the slightly nutty Walter Huston (Howard), to the likeable Tim Holt (Curtin), to the ultimately greed-infected Humphrey Bogart (Fred C. Dobbs).  The acting is especially first-rate when Bogart is outfitting a burro with sacks, all the while muttering to himself and venting.<br /><br />While I highly recommend the film, I do believe that Bogart's transition from nice guy to greed monster is a bit too rapid or, perhaps, inconsistent, which is more the screenplay's fault (or the director's) than anything else.  Fred C. Dobbs seems all crazy about gold in one scene, then too even-keeled in the next before getting back to wacky Gold Dust Dobbs again.  Sure, maybe it could go that way, particularly if one is periodically left alone with one's thoughts, but nevertheless his decay seems a bit unnatural.
B002QGUFWE|1.0|there is no mention that this is an edited version of the CD.  i think Amazon is going to have a lot of angry customers.    the album is amazing though.
B002X20W2E|1.0|I was all set to purchase this Rihanna CD at the discount price because I like her music. But, when I saw that every song came with an explicit rating, I realized that there was no way this CD was going to become part of my library. Let's hope this is just a phase that Rihanna is going through, and she matures soon. If this is the real her, then she will never be added to my library any more.
B001AVCFJM|1.0|\\"Stardate 44...whatever\\" - Jim Kirk, Star Trek (2009). Sums up the care taken by Paramount to include the elegant and detail rich universe that once made up Star Trek. \\"Star Trek, Star Wars... whatever\\" is what I believe the writers and producers decided upon prior to setting out on this high-budget endeavor to destroy one great universe. Is it a good flick? Yes! Is it a good Star Trek? Definitely not.     They summed up their feelings towards us Trekkers in the movie quite nicely: by having \\"Admiral\\" Archer's prize beagle in a transporter accident thus being lost forever. Their way of saying to us: \\"it's our franchise and we can do what we want to it, show us the $\\".   3.5 stars if it wasn't a Star Trek Film    0 stars if they claim otherwise.    I'm very glad I boycotted the film in the theaters and decided upon renting it first. This one will not be in my STAR TREK collection, as it simply doesn't belong in that universe.    -----------------------------  To the poster who wrote this...\\"The haters have to get over themselves and their big brains.... I think some people want to hate on something so they can pretend to be \\"smart trekkies\\". I know 99.9% of the people who watch this will think its awesome like ME!\\"    People are allowed their opinions. Obviously, you feel otherwise and believe throwing insults further supports your own opinion. Simple arithmetic shows that 99.9% of the people did not give this movie 5 stars like you.
B001DDBCUU|5.0|I'll assume those here have seen the movie, or at the very least the tv show. I'm a huge fan of both, so I opted for the special edition dvd. The first disc features an extended film. I couldn't get enough of this film, so I was thrilled to have the extra 12 minutes, but I'm not sure you would miss them if you didn't know about them. The digital copy of the film is great, but most fans probably don't have a need for it. I love being able to watch it anytime, on my computer or tv. The deleted scenes are fun if you liked the movie, but the conversations with Sarah Jessica Parker and Michael Patrick King are underwhelming. If you read any of the reviews or paid any attention to the movie's extensive publicity, then you won't find much that's new.<br /><br />Essentially: if you liked this movie a lot, you'll appreciate at least some of the extras, but if you're not a huge fan, then you probably won't miss them if you opt for the \\"regular\\" edition.
B0026P3G12|5.0|The CD just arrived at my doorstep and I had to listen to it right away. Susan Boyle lives up to the promise of her sensational arrival.  She has a lovely voice and each performance is different, giving her voice a chance to explore different genres. I thought I'd purchase the CD to support her efforts, but find that I am enjoying it far more than I expected.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|I don't have a Kindle yet, but I do have the new Kindle for PC program, and the ability to download free copies of classics is fantastic. This book is perfect to read on the computer because it's short and seasonal.
B002UXRH10|5.0|Very unexpected.... Very!! I am impressed with the album, it's well put together!! Every track is SOLID from the amazing vocals to the amazing beats, you can tell she put a lot of effort into it. Regardless to what the media says about Rihanna, she's very talented - She's a sex symbol! Everybody wants to argue about Rihanna but c'mon, she's AMAZING!
B000000W5N|5.0|I will be short I am a huge Stones fan so of coures i like this album but if you are not a fan please listen to it first it is not for everybody. There are bands that i don't like e.g. GNR but I will not bash them some people love them. I a big Beetles fan as well but i will not compare the two bands its and insult to the Beetles and Stones. So if you like Rock and Roll give it a listen i think you will like them. If not move on and find something that works for you

B0026P3G12|5.0|If you are a fan of Susan's, like most of us are, you will enjoy this album.  Her voice is lovely, the songs are heartfelt, the orchestrations pleasant.  What more could anyone ask?  For any naysayers out there, I say stop being such a musical snob and enjoy this wonderful album, and appreciate the beauty it adds to our world!

B001AVCFK6|5.0|I saw this movie at the theater this summer and really enjoyed it.  I was taken aback on the new direction taken by this new movie, and had a little trouble following it completely.  Even so, I thought it was a good movie.  Friends that went with me are not Star Trek fans, and they raved about what a terrific movie it was.<br />Having just watched it on dvd here at home, I have to say I LOVED it!  I found so much more in it this time around, and had time to really appreciate the story, action, acting, humor, etc.  I'm just speaking for myself, but being a huge Star Trek fan, I thought it was excellent in every way.  And I'm thrilled the franchise has been renewed in such a positive way, and totally new direction.  I can't wait for the next movie!!
B0026P3G12|5.0|Wow, dreams do come true. Susan is proof. The songs on this span a wide vocal range and she can carry them all off. Her voice is so sweet and mellow. It's hard to pick one favorite but I love the number 9 Who I was Born to Be, and  ofcourse I dreamed a Dream.<br /><br />Susan you look fantastic on the album. I wish I could be transformed as you have. I am so happy for you, good things do come to those who wait.<br /><br />Highly recommend to people who like say Barbara Streisand, Josh Groban, she is in the same league.
B002H3F7F6|1.0|As an avid Sting fan, I could not wait to purchase this album. Imagine my disappointment when I discovered that the noise created by this album barely constitute singing. Throughout the album, Sting's voice is at its raspy worst as he is clearly singing songs that are not within his vocal range and the end result is hollow and sad. The accompaniment is beautiful on most of these tracks, too bad Sting couldn't be bothered to arrange the vocals to suit his natural vocal range.
0545123267|4.0|I thought this book was ok. I liked it, but I didn't find myself having to find out what happened next. It's a great story, with tragedy, comedy, love, etc. Just didn't grab me enough to love it. I will read the others and maybe they'll pull me in more.
B0000263JN|5.0|At times, you hear about some person or group that was once extremely popular and considered very important, and now they seem to have disappeared from the haunts of men.  Sometimes these people retain a cult following to this day, and you probably know of several yourself.  The Incredible String Band is one such.  The appeared at Woodstock, for goodness's sake, but they didn't get into the movie and no one ever plays their material on the radio.  You listen to \\"The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter\\" and you have to wonder why.<br /><br />The fact that the record is available on CD indicates that someone or another is interested, however.  There's another phenomenon to wonder about, at least until you listen to the music.<br /><br />Now, let's face facts; this stuff is very much of its time in the late 1960s.  It's full of unusual instrumentation (at the end of \\"The Minotaur's Song\\" it sounds like someone drops a pile of stainless steel cookware from the ceiling onto a hard stone floor), obscure references (who writes a song about the Minotaur to begin with?) and a sort of innocence that can be a little grating at times.  Even the album cover is a few years out of date - it's a picture of a bunch of people dressed like hippies hanging out in the woods.  You can't even tell which of them are band members until you flip the thing over and discover that the ensemble consists primarily of two men.  Weird.<br /><br />All this really means, though, is that you don't go into this record expecting \\"Anarchy in the UK\\".  Take this music on its own terms and, like the title says, it's beautiful.  Also, thankfully, it doesn't take itself with that grinding seriousness you sometimes get with hippie bands.<br /><br />First of all, Robin Williamson and Mike Heron actually knew what they were doing.  Under all the flutes and finger cymbals and harps and stuff, there's a solid basic grounding in rhythm guitar or keyboards, and a lot of the songs owe something to good old-fashioned English folk music or some other kind of world tradition, such as the quotes from the music of the Bahamas scattered all through \\"A Very Cellular Song\\".  The originality and flights of fancy take off from there, so you get a sense of solid reality and dreamy fantasy both at the same time.<br /><br />A good example of this is \\"Waltz of the New Moon\\".  The instruments are harpsichord, guitar and harp, which sounds totally ethereal, but it's a waltz, all right.  Someone keeps up a steady \\"oom-pah-pah\\" almost all the way through, which means that when Robin Williamson wonders poetically if garden snails even know the stars exist, he's not just dropping warm fuzzies all over the place.<br /><br />Even the less rhythmic songs stay grounded pretty well, although in some cases I can't quite tell how they manage it.  Part of it, I think, has to do with the commitment these guys have to emotional reality.  The album closer, \\"Nightfall,\\" is one of the most peaceful songs ever recorded, but when Williamson sings \\"Oh sleep, come to me,\\" it sounds like he hasn't had any rest in weeks.<br /><br />Elsewhere on this record, the guys sound like they're just out for a good time, especially Mike Heron on \\"Mercy I Cry City\\".  It seems to be about a guy from out in the country somewhere who's moved to town and finds that it's slowly driving him crazy, but the tune is a joyful little jig for acoustic guitar, tin whistle and harmonica.  What's more, at one point you hear Heron chirp \\"Mercy I cry, city, you're all upon my mind!\\" and way behind him, Williamson mutters, \\"But the opposite is also true.\\"  A cheap joke in the middle of an anti-urban protest song?  Yep.  And sung from the gut, just like everywhere else on this record.<br /><br />I'm told that in their subsequent work, the Incredible String Band lost that grounding in reality and turned into robe-wearing, flower-eating, musical-discipline-shunning annoyances, at least according to some people.  I can't confirm or deny this, but I'm notterribly surprised that they lost that delicate balance between the sky and the earth - that is, between the beautiful daughter and the hangman.  It takes terribly hard work to dig deep and produce that kind of perfection (not to put too fine a point on it).  Most don't even want to try.  Thankfully, like these guys, some do.<br /><br />Benshlomo says, It's hard to keep one foot in the air and one foot on the ground, but that's how you walk.the sky and the earth - that is, between the beautiful daughter and the hangman.

B0026P3G12|5.0|This album of music was full of what I would term safe choices for Ms. Boyle. More mainstream than daring, but the album of music is a wonderful addition to the easy listening market. Susan's story and voice captured everyone's attention. This album while not fulfilling the full promise of her talent, is an excellent start to showcasing her voice.<br /><br />The songs are powerful vehicles of heartbreak, of spirituality, of the pain of living and the joy of being. How refreshing it is to have a person like Susan Boyle sing them rather than a teen pop sensation who's biggest disappointment in life is not getting what they want when they want it. Susan seems to have put her heart and soul into singing many of the pieces and because she is older and because she has experienced a lot of heartache the songs are something you can relate to.<br /><br />When I saw that the Stone's Wild Horses was the first selection, I must admit to some negative thoughts--just couldn't imagine anyone else performing this piece with any mastery. Wow, Susan rocks Wild Horses. It is a stunning rendition. She also does a wonderful job on Daydream Believer and Amazing Grace. Susan shows her range best on Who I was Born to Be. If she chooses to put out a Christmas album next year, after listening to her rendition of Silent Night, she will most likely corner the market! There are a few stinkers, but that is to be expected from any artist<br /><br />Susan's story is the stuff dreams are made of and I for one am glad that the CD lives up to the hype and the promise of more music from this talented singer. Hopefully on future albums she will take more chances and explore her talent more fully!
B001EYGOG0|2.0|The Count Basie Orchestra and the ensemble musical arrangements on this album are spot on. You can hear the energy in the big band instrumentals and the intimacy of the jazz ensemble. If only this album were an instrumental.     Unfortunately, the vocals by Tony Bennett are almost painful to listen to. The clipping of notes, the speaking of phrases, and \\"improv\\" are all too apparent as he struggles to deliver the vocals with any grace and authority. Twenty years ago, this would have been a fantastic holiday album. Today it's an extreme disappointment.    The better alternatives would be to buy Christmas albums from Frank, Sammy, Dean, Ella, and Tony in their prime.
B002X063OC|5.0|This is a nice set of 8 songs, none of which feel throwaway to me. I'm really happy they released this separately so you aren't forced to buy the deluxe edition with all the songs from the fame again! Beyonce is a fun addition to this CD in the song Telephone, but the real surprise for me on the CD is the song Speechless which almost feels like a genre shift! - I immediately had it stuck in my head, and have played it on repeat several times; it really highlights what a good voice she has. I would think this CD will please fans of the first CD as it is mostly in the same mode - very catchy!<br /><br />The link to the CD format goes to an expensive special edition not released yet - here is the proper link to the CD format [[ASIN:B002W6Z0UK The Fame Monster]]
B0026P3G12|5.0|Overall, it's an excellent CD and I have no regrets about ordering it.  While it's well done, the numbers don't have the punch that her live performances have had.  But I don't think that's too unusual; I've found that to be the case with many artists.  I think it's probably difficult to be as 'up' in a studio as one is in front of a live audience.    Only one number has me puzzled, and that's \\"How Great Thou Art.\\"  She essentially sings the chorus over and over, without doing any of the verses.  However, in the booklet she's written some lovely notes about why each song was chosen, and about this one she says she did it to honor a friend at church who loves to sing it.  It may be that her church only sings the chorus, or that there's another explanation.  I really miss hearing the verses, but I'm not willing to downgrade the whole CD because of that.  \\"Daydream Believer\\" also lacks all of the verses we originally heard in the '60's, but it's still lovely.    Every song is well done, even if not 100% to my liking.  Susan, as soon as you're ready to record another CD, my cursor will be over the \\"Buy with 1 click\\" button.  I'd love to hear a bunch of Broadway standards from you, but I'll be happy with the results of wherever your heart leads you.
0439023491|5.0|I thought this book was much better than the first! I liked the first a lot, but this one kept me wanting more and more, even at the end! She leaves you hanging! There were tons of twists that I would've never dreamed would happen, but they all made the book that much greater! I'm still pushing for her love for Peeta and I really think they need to be together in the end, we don't really know much at all about Katniss' best friend, his name is at a loss to me right now...so I REALLY hope she doesn't end up with him again. The love the books overall meaning of society and how so many of us view others as lesser beings...so sad...
B0026P3G12|5.0|I Dreamed a Dream does not dissapoint Susan Boyle fans.The songs we heard over the last couple of months   \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\",  \\"Cry me a River\\"  and the  Rolling Stones \\"Wild Horses\\",are included,but some of the pleasent surprises, Madonna's \\"You'll See,\\"about being abused as a child, The Monkees `Daydream Believer' and an original recording, \\"Who I Was Born To Be\\" are fantastic.This CD gives everyone hope who has talent,who's not 16  and wears a size 0 .If you have the gift,Its never too late .
0740785508|5.0|I'm naturally adept at art, but for some reason, I never seized any opportunities to fully delve into the subject. I keep trying to find time, but my work and other interests usually rob me of any moments that would be conducive to artistic pursuits. Does this sound a lot like you? Well, this book is going to be a fascinating and valuable helping hand into the subject of creating convincing things that actually don't exist!<br /><br />This book is a veritable treasure trove of helpful advice and tips on how artists use various tools and methods to train their imaginative energies into yielding the substance of imagination on paper. I expect it will be particularly helpful to people wanting to delve deeper into this subject and needing some pointers on how to approach varying subject matters. This book can save the budding artist a lot of time by bringing them closer to the tried and tested methods that help artists to explore the unexplored.<br /><br />I am very excited about finding this book, as it will answer many questions that have plagued my thoughts over the many years as I have dipped into and out of fantasy art. It's also inspired me to pick up my pencil again and try to find time to embark on some adventures on paper!<br /><br />I thoroughly recommend this book from novice to professional artist as the coaching that it provides can help various abilities at many different levels.
0307454541|4.0|Stieg Larsson's \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is set mostly in Sweden.  The hero is forty-two year old Mikael Blomkvist, a once-respected financial journalist who is convicted of libel and has no plans to appeal.  He had been trying to bring down a crooked industrialist but realizes that he has failed miserably.  His biggest regret is that the negative publicity surrounding his trial will harm the magazine, \\"Millennium,\\" of which he is part owner.  His only consolation is his ongoing relationship with the editor-in-chief of the publication, Erika Berger, his best friend and occasional lover.<br /><br />Soon, Blomkvist has another distraction to take his mind off his impending jail sentence.  Eighty-two year old Henry Vanger, a wealthy man and former head of his family's vast business empire, hires Mikael to write his biography, but admits that his underlying objective is to find out who murdered his beloved granddaughter, Harriet, thirty-six years earlier.  Although Blomkvist has no desire to tackle this very cold case, Vanger makes him an offer that he cannot refuse.  Soon, Mikael takes up residence in the remote town where Henrik lives, and the reporter finds out more than he would like to know about the Vanger family's dirty laundry.  As he digs deeper, Blomkvist gradually learns the sordid truth about this incredibly dysfunctional clan. His unlikely ally in his inquiries is an emotionally damaged twenty-four year old named Lisbeth Salander, an investigative genius who never lets anyone get too close to her.<br /><br />Reg Keeland's polished translation from the Swedish makes this book a pleasure to read.  Although the plot is overly complicated, it is intriguing and suspenseful.  Mikael is a handsome and likeable individual who seems to attract almost every woman he meets.  It is fun to follow along as he sifts through hundreds of documents and photographs and interviews persons of interest, looking for answers that have eluded law enforcement professionals for decades.  Lisbeth, who has a tattoo of a dragon (among others) and various piercings, is a rebel who is desperately trying to live down her miserable childhood and find her way in a world that has treated her brutally and unfairly.<br /><br />Although \\"The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo\\" has become an international sensation, it is not without flaws.  It is too long and veers uneasily from one subplot to another. The villains are stereotypical psychopaths.  By the time the author reaches his long-awaited conclusion, he scrambles to tie up a variety of loose ends, with uneven results.  Still, most readers will find themselves caught up in the story's many twists and turns and will be drawn to the immensely appealing Lisbeth and Mikael.

B002QGUFWE|5.0|This album is outstanding.  Every track stands out and is single-worthy.  I haven't listened to a CD in ages that I was excited to hear every track.  Plus, you get the first album as a bonus disc in case you don't already have it!
B000002UAU|1.0|I ordered a brand new copy of the Sgt. Pepper's cd.  I paid the brand new price.  I received a used CD.  It had no plastic covering, and was labelled \\"USED\\".      I don't think this is right.  And there seems to be nowhere to complain except here.
B002QHH22O|5.0|Great metal album with hilarious lyrics.  Hopefully, the album is successful and the band moves from comedic to more-serious lyrics.  The lead singer (Starr) has a great voice and the lead guitarist (Satchel) is spectacularly talented, excellent solos.  The drummer and the bassist are solid as well.  Some of their cover songs are better in various aspects than the originals but are not on this album (again the lead singer is very, very good, great voice).  Starr could give D.L. Roth and Vince Neil a run for their $$.
B002NWRMVS|1.0|Not a lot to say about this dull, dull album. Suffice it to say, that it is more dreary, dull and unimpressive music from the world's most boring singer. It was on in my workplace and I hardly noticed it. Dull and dumb music, even though it is loaded with pretensions. The best thing I can say about this recording is that it would make unobtrusive muzak in elevators.<br /><br />It is sad that resources are wasted upon junk like this.

B0026P3G12|5.0|After anxiously awaiting this cd for months and barely being able to contain myself when it finally arrived on my doorstep today, I listened to it in its entirety and I'm simply thrilled.  Wow!  There wasn't a dry eye in my house by the last track, \\"Silent Night\\".<br /><br />Her voice is so beautiful, so soulful, so purely angelic, so classy.....it breaks through emotional barriers and pierces the soul like none other.  \\"How Great Thou Art\\" and \\"Amazing Grace\\" had me on my knees in prayer and worship to God.  I wept with an aching heart and soul listening to her.  She is magnificent.  The background orchestra and choir are stunning.  Her cd is not only awesome, it's awe-inspiring.<br /><br />If you haven't bought this cd yet, don't miss out on it!<br /><br />I am looking forward to future new releases from her.  Each one can't come soon enough!<br /><br />God Bless you Susan Boyle, peace be with you..always!
B001AVCFK6|1.0|Boy, just when I thought I knew how to tell one version from another, Amazon threw me a curve on this one. You'd think that having a THREE! disc set you would end up with a regular DVD copy for the other non-Blu-Ray players in the house. Not with this one. One Blu-Ray and two crap extra junk discs. I'm mad at myself for not reading closely enough but the advertising on new movies is not as straight-forward as it should be. Fool me once....
B002QB1910|4.0|There is alot of talk about Rihanna's state of mind:  1.) She is no longer the good girl we fell in love with.   2.) She is taking a harder edge to her work and image.  3.) She is MORE raw in interviews about men and sex.    She is harder, bolder, rawer, and probably more crazier. However, her personal lifestyle (and nightmare) has created a new Rihanna with a much darker vibe and I love it! My favorite songs are:  \\"Mad House\\" gives you a warning...if you handle it, then stay out the kitchen.   \\"Wait Your Turn\\" took multiple listenings to get use to because its so different. However, there is a message in the song.  \\"Hard\\" is my SONG and show us the NEW Rihanna.  \\"Stupid In Love\\" has a nice melody and is quite personal.   \\"Rude Boy\\" will become the jam in clubs soon.  \\"Cold Case Love\\" is simply stunning and haunting.  \\"Rockstar 101\\" everytime I hear this song, I feel like rocking out!    With this album, Rihanna reminds me a little of Grace Jones and I appreciate her taking risks with her career. She also has a bonus track \\"Hole In My Head\\" (available on another site) which is more dance/pop than rock or hip-hop. Any any rate, this is a solid effort!
0061703257|5.0|I do not usually read the suspense/mystery genre.  But perhaps I should.  I literally could not put this book down until I had finished it.  What an ending.  When I had to put the book down, I kept thinking about it.  That to me is what good fiction does to a reader.
0307473465|4.0|This is an excellent book. We chose it to read for our book club and most people read it in one session as they could not put it down. It is very well written and the characters well portrayed. It is the story of a young boy's obsession with an older woman. Years later he finds out about her past life and the big secret that was really the cause of what happened. It is quite a short book but has a lot of content.

B001T30232|5.0|If you can get past the first chapter without tearing up, kudos to you.  The first chapter is a bit sad, but the story starts at the end, so buck up and make your way to the 2nd chapter and the rest is great.  If you are a dog lover, this book gives such an amazing insight into what our dogs could be thinking.  Things like, \\"If I only had imposable thumbs...\\" and their 6th sense for knowing things before humans do.  It is the life and experiences of an aspiring racecar driver through the eyes of his dog.  The man's dreams, life and love are all experienced by the dog as well since the dog is a big part of his life.  The ending will give you chills and make you wonder, what if?  Though it starts out sad, it gets much happier by the end.  I would HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who enjoys seeing things from a different perspective.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I Dreamed A Dream, Susan Boyle's debut album, is a showcase for her crystal clear voice, untouched by the technological gimmicks on which so many singers rely. The production is a spare canvas against which her pure, gorgeous vocals are displayed to wonderful effect. The result is an album that owes its power solely to Boyle's self-assured artistry.       In the title track, I Dreamed A Dream, Boyle gives a far different interpretation from her iconic performance on Britain's Got Talent. In her audition, she gave a rendition that was more akin to a soaring anthem than a downtrodden woman's rueful rumination on a ruined life. Here, however, Boyle gives the song a more nuanced interpretation that reflects the despair of dreams unfulfilled and a life shattered by loss. Her vocals are just as assured as in her first performance of the song, yet deeper here and more passionate.       Some of the song choices which may have seemed odd at first glance turned out to have been inspired. The selection of the Rolling Stones' 1971 classic, Wild Horses, must have struck many as a bizarre decision doomed to failure. As listeners know well by now, Boyle, aided by Steve Mac's spartan production, reworked the song into a haunting paean to love and loss. Another seemingly off-the-wall choice was Daydream Believer, first recorded by the Monkees. Here, the sprightly, upbeat tune is transformed by Boyle's gentle, lyrical delivery into a dreamy and contemplative ballad. This, in my opinion, is the track that serves as the best showcase for her talents as her clear, lovely vocals float above the simple piano accompaniment. The effect is intimate, as if we are listening in on the singer's reverie.      Boyle's new rendition of Cry Me A River is stronger and more bitter than the delicate, gentle version she recorded in 1999. While never reaching the furious depths of some other versions of the song, she still conveys the anger of a woman scorned. You'll See is also a delight as Boyle invests Madonna's anthem with her personal pain and determination.        Overall, this is a beautiful album with every track a gem. Fans of Susan Boyle and of good music in general will love her debut effort.
B002QY9RMA|2.0|I Am... Sasha Fierce is a good effort by Beyonce. She took risks both creatively and vocally by expanding her sound from R&B. She incoporated opera (Ava Maria), folk (Disappear), dancehall (Video Phone), and euro-pop (Sweet Dreams). I thought her song \\"Smash Into You\\" was simply pretty (even though she didn't write a note or a word of that song. She is listed as a songwriter, but I discovered Jon McLaughlin \\"Smack Into You\\".  Beyonce needs to stop slapping her names to songs she did not write). At any rate, I give this album (the first deluxe version) a three!    This NEW version includes the remix of Video Phone, Why Don't You Love Me? and the so-so song Poison. So why am I giving this album a 2 stars? Well, Beyonce has become the \\"Queen of Re-Releases\\" and that is NOT a good title to have. So far, this album has a standard edition, deluxe edition, platium edition, a remix/dvd edition, a live/dvd edition and countless tour editions from around the world! Did she really need to re-release this (average) album again? No one is forcing fans to buy her all her editions but it doesn't make what she is doing right. Its not just Beyonce that does this (I have talked about Usher and Mariah Carey before), but Beyonce is the WORST! Good work doesn't need different editions...it can stand on it own. Sadly, Beyonce and other artists don't realize this...its all about the money at this point. What a shame! As for the new songs...none of the \\"new\\" songs are above average, so buying this re-release is not worth it.
B002UZ3M8U|5.0|Amazing CD! Very upbeat and catchy with a hint of Queen along with jazz and some orchestra rolled into this ridiculous combination of tunes. Makes me wanna dance around and puts the biggest grin on my face. Truly need to give Fun. a high five when I see them...Truly need to.

0307165485|5.0|My daughter introduced me to Richard Scarry's book 2 years ago. She had received one as a gift for her son and it has been the best read book since. In asking what she might want for him this year, she didn't hesitate.  Scarry's books are filled with pictures and very simple words that you can teach your children.  It's not \\"overdone\\" like some \\"teaching\\" books I have seen.  Delightful artwork and creatively designed.  I would like to shake his hand and thank him for the gift he is sharing with wee folks.  He has to be a gracious man who loves children and knows how to tap into their little minds in a way that \\"sticks\\" with them.<br /><br />Anyone who purchases any of his books will be quite pleased with their purchase.
B001FB4W0M|5.0|This blu ray edition has a superior video quality to the standard dvd version. I don't know why some people don't think that this picture isn't great other than the show is a dark show shot on standard film so it doesn't look as sharp as many MOVIES on blu ray.  This is a common complaint for tv series on blu ray and older movies too. The source material is often grainer and on less than todays movie quality filmstock.  So expect this to be less than a modern film in blu ray clarity and you'll love it.  The stories continue on with lots of humour and horror mixed for ulitmate tv horror viewing pleasure. Of course this is less bloody than a R rated movie and one should expect tv type violence similiar to the great \\"Angel' , \\"Charmed\\" or \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" series that graced our screens in the last 14 years, although none of those have gotten a blu ray release yet sadly.  This whole series is quality without a single bad episode and it's characters are ones that even a casual viewer can relate to and enjoy.  SO get supernatural! blu ray that is.
B002UXRH10|5.0|There is alot of talk about Rihanna's state of mind:   1.) She is no longer the good girl we fell in love with.   2.) She is taking a harder edge to her work and image.   3.) She is MORE raw in interviews about men and sex.     She is harder, bolder, rawer, and probably more crazier. However, her personal lifestyle (and nightmare) has created a new Rihanna with a much darker vibe and I love it!

B000001FW9|4.0|Gentle Giant have a very unique place in prog. They were well known, as were Yes and Genisis. But their music was far more daring and complex, more in line with bands like Van Der Graff Generator and National Health.<br /><br />Aquiring The Taste, their second, shows all I love about this band. They use no improvosation, but their writting is extremely complex, using dissonence and counterpoint infinately more advanced than ELP, or Yes, or any arena prog band. They don't use a lot of soloing, but their compositions are completely unpredictable. You think a song is going one way, and out jumps a part with a new, equally complicated pattern, with instruments that add a completely different texture.<br />But it works almost every time.<br /><br />Giant must have worked months on these albums, or spent months planning before getting into a studio, becuase the freshness of the complexity is amamzing.<br /><br />For those new to prog, or new to really, really good prog, it can take awhile to absorb this complex music--it does not follow traditional song format- but repeated listens make this well worth the effort
B002LL13AM|5.0|There's a tendency these days to judge performances by `perfection' rather than by expressiveness, passion, or less measurable aspects. In terms of the Preludes and Fugues, as the pieces lend so much for analyses, it is easy to miss the key point. As indeed, those who cannot evaluate things by way of depth and breadth often use detail and other much more superficial and artificial ideas as their ideal of perfection and excellence. \\"Perfect\\" is that realm becomes science, not art.<br />The Well-tempered Claiver Book I of Maurizio Pollini blows away every accusation of his being `cool', `mechanical', `precise' (qualities that never had been his hallmark in the real sense). Pollini really makes the 12 pairs sing.<br />I began listening to these pieces with Ralph Kirkpatrick's harpsichord version. As a piano player, it did me much more harm than good for these works. To put it in simple terms, I disliked them: the clangy-bangy sound on the harpsichord coupled with Kirkpatrick's more Apollonian view of these works were quite enough to kill them for me.<br />Then follows Glenn Gould's and Friedrich Gulda's very `scientific' renditions, and S. Richter's rather uneven reading. They sounded some what better; then Angela Hewitt's first album did managed to alleviate the harm to some extent, but unfortunately her second volume is more willful and mannered. Indeed, Edwin Fischer had a much more appealing volume on his `historical' album dated back to the 1930's, but the sound quality could no way be matched with modern day hi-tech recordings.<br />It has always been a great shame that Wilhelm Kempff's set of \\"well-tempered clavier\\" has gone out of print on DG, and the great Bach expert organist Karl Richter had not, during his short life, recorded the well-tempered clavier on any keyboard instrument.<br />Luckily Pollini came to my aid in good time. His preludes and fugues are real joys to listen to.  I don't care if they are `perfect' or not. Pollini's singing tone in the counterpoints is simply too beautiful for any distraction of a more inferior order. While you listen, you can imagine yourself sitting in a huge church, with a wonderful chorus singing out the contrapuntal melodies, and a small chamber orchestra making great accompaniment. Or more so still, you can imagine Bach's Brandenburg Concerti, his b Minor Mass, his Cantatas.... Pollini draws direct references to these other works of Bach in his performance. By far the most satisfying WTC I've encountered yet, largely because of the spontaneity and emotional depth manifested in these pieces.<br />The only question that remains is - will he record Volume 2?<br /><br />ADDENDUM<br />Having by now listened to more rounds of Maestro Pollini's WTC Vol. 1, and having considered the review of MUI comparing Pollini's with Gulda's, I would perhaps add a word or two more on this new and revelatory interpretation of the WTC Vol I by Pollini.<br />I agree that the WTC in this performance sound much more 'vertical' or 'spherical' than most other great performances of the same work. What strikes me further, however, is how Pollini has dwelled into these works in real depth stylistically.<br />I have started to play the entire Vol. 1 since the age of 10. By now I have learned those pieces for decades. What sets Pollini's performance apart is his baroque style: grandiose and flambouyant. He weaves the phrases and counterpoints with real swerve and nuance. There is hardly any single idle phrase. This alarming state of concentration in performance is at the same time coupled with expressively beautiful touching, a hallmark of Pollini's since the earliest days he performs in public on the pianoforte. Listening to this set of WTC, the experience is akin to listening to a period baroque orchestra.<br />I emphasize 'period' here, because in comparison to Gulda's more modernist approach, Pollini's interpretation is more stylistically informed. It is more than evident that the Maestro has done extensiveresearch into these compositions before putting them down in performance here. Not since Karl Richter have I heard more energised and nuanced Bach interpretation. Again, as I said, it is a great pity that Karl Richter did not leave any recording of the WTC.<br />Hats off to Maestro Pollini!tting them down in performance here. Not since Karl Richter have I heard more energised and nuanced Bach interpretation. Again, as I said, it is a great pity that Karl Richter did not leave any recording of the WTC.   Hats off to Maestro Pollini!
0307278255|2.0|No writer I know (other than Graham Greene, of a earlier era) is able to convey simple reminders of the most profound human truths than Ms. Lahiri - especially her 'Interpreter of Maladies'.    that said, Unaccustomed Earth is not up to this mark, the stories dont seem as deeply felt, and sort of thrown together and have abrupt, unfulfilling endings, even by short story standards.     I also have complaints  about her writing style and subject matter: For one, her stories and characters are always a little TOO lonely, disaffected or just plain sad to be credible.  We all know that nearly all peopele - even non-Bengali immigrants to the US East Coast - having occasionally trying lives, but it seems to me that she emphasizes the underlying sadness or meaninglessness of human existence a little too much.  After all, there are millions of immigrants who live happy, fulfilled lives and mostly satisfying relationships - does she need keep trying to be the Dostoyevsky (or Coetzee) of Bengali immigrants.  I know Tolstoy said that happy families are all the same, but unhappy families are all interesting, but come on...!    speaking of Bengalis - everything is Bengali this or Bengali that in her writing.  here is a little newsflash - Bengalis, despite what many Bengalis like Lahiri might think,  are not that different from other Indians - Bengal only being one of India's 25+ states for over 60 years.  Ms. Lahiri seems to keep referrring to Bengalis as if it were some special, poetic corner of Indian society.  Maybe she is thinks that Indian might be too bland and Bengali has more cachet, but problem is that  every Bengali is 95% like every other Indian - good or bad.   Try writing your next novel with \\"India\\" replacing 'Bengal' - it wouldnt hurt it a bit, might even be more authentic.
0307460444|5.0|Martha Stewart's Cupcakes is an amazing cookbook filled with 175 different cupcake recipes. Going beyond just plain chocolate or vanilla, Stewart's cookbook contains many unique but delicious recipes for any occasion. For example, her book includes recipes for Boston Cream Pie cupcakes, Peanut Butter and Jelly cupcakes, and Pistachio cupcakes, which are all pretty unusual. My personal favorite is the mocha cupcake because I love the amazing combination of chocolate and coffee in both the cake and the frosting. All the other recipes I have made have been very delicious as well. The instructions for each recipe are very detailed yet uncomplicated. There is no need to be an experienced baker to use this cookbook. Also, there are large, colorful pictures accompanying each recipe which are very helpful. It is always nice to have these to reference when cooking or baking, even if mine never seem to turn out nearly as perfect the ones in the pictures. Furthermore, the cookbook contains instructions on how to present your finished cupcakes in an attractive manner without a great deal of difficulty. As an un-creative person, these ideas were perfect for me. Cupcakes are a dessert trend that is on the rise, with cupcake bakeries popping up all over the place. This book allows anyone to make bakery quality cupcakes at home, without spending a huge amount of money. Overall, I would definitely recommend Martha Stewart's Cupcakes to anyone who wants to learn how to put a new twist on this classic dessert.
0783231032|4.0|This film has always gotten a bad rap from the crittics. But don`t let that bother you, it really is a very funny film.<br />It all revolves around the fear of a Jap invasion of CA right after Pearle Harbour. There are plenty of nuts running wild and even<br />one or two reasonably sane characters. It`s non-stop gags and non-stop laughs. If anything it`s too wild and crazy. Not the best<br />timing, with too many things going on at once.<br />Still, I give it 4 stars just for the shear number of laughs. The bit with Slim Pickens being captured by the crew of a Jap sub is<br />worth the price of the movie all by itself.

B002W6Z0UK|5.0|Lady Gaga is truly an artist to say the least, There are absolutely no words to express my appreciation for her keeping real dance music alive! Making it all her very own with her psychedelic, Exotic and odd nature. Yet still staying true to the genre of what we call pop/dance.<br /><br />She's giving mainstream music what it's been deprived of for nearly over a decade. I haven't heard such a great set of dance hooks since the late 80's and early 90's so this is exciting for me. I'm fascinated by her quirky and cool ideas. She's one of the few real talents we have in popmusic right now.<br /><br />I would claim this to be more of an EP rather than a sophomore album. Which is still fine by me since Lady Gaga doesn't keep us waiting for NEW material. She uses that creative mind of hers to keep her audience occupied & entertained between albums. Unlike many artists Lady Gaga writes and releases NEW material spontaneously ,as you can see (When SHE feels the time is right)without the long and dreadful wait. What more can a FAN ask for? I love it. I know we'll be seeing much more of Lady Gaga in the years to come (Mark my words). Onto the music><br /><br />\\"Dance In The Dark\\" is only (1) of my top (4) favorites from this collection (I couldn't choose just one) alongside \\"Bad Romance\\" \\"Monster\\" & \\"Speechless\\". It blew me away with it's massive 80's sound (I love 80's music), also somewhere in the beat \\"I\\" hear a mash-up between George Michael's \\"Careless Whisper\\" sped-up with a dash of Lady Gaga's own \\"I Like It Rough\\" from her debut \\"The Fame Original\\" (Nothing official, Just something I picked up on my own). \\"Dance In The Dark\\" sounds like a remastered head-spinning pop track straight from 1988, NO JOKE!<br /><br />\\"Monster\\" is alot like the early to mid-80's sound of early Hip-Hop music when most rappers referred to themselves as MC's (If you can date back that far). The drum arrangement reminds me of the beats rappers would battle to with it's percussion and synthetic drums n' rythyms in the verses... (1984 to be exact), The beat transitions into a BIG and EXPLOSIVE dance beat identical to it's sister-song's \\"Dance In The Dark\\", \\"Bad Romance\\" & \\"Pokerface (The Fame Original)\\" The same NRG of these fabulous tracks can be experienced in the chorus of this song.<br /><br />I'm also surprised with the song \\"Speechless\\", It's a folk-pop song in a style more similar to something Vanessa Carlton, K.T. Tunstall or Sara Bareilles would do. A lot different from the rest of the tracks on both The \\"Original\\" & \\"Monster\\" versions of \\"The Fame\\". Lady Gaga, Throughout the short time she's been noticed has shown how versatile and unique she is through her Odd sense of style and taste. You'll find Lady Gaga sharing her talent through Live-Acoustics, Piano, Folk and Dance through-out her diverse catalogue (listen to her song \\"Honest Eyes\\"). She \\"is\\" a character and i'm always charmed to hear and See the NEW art she's constantly putting together.<br /><br />\\"The Fame Monster\\" is simply (8) tracks long, And still comes off as being COMPLETE (to me). Reason being is that Lady Gaga is devoted to her art, When listening to this collection you can hear the passion in her work as a Singer-Songwriter & Producer. Lady Gaga has put her blood, sweat and tears into each of the (8) songs on this release. There's not one bland track on this release, i'm sure Lady Gaga feels this project (\\"The Fame\\") is finally COMPLETE \\"The Fame...MONSTER\\".<br /><br />Thank you Lady Gaga (again) for giving us back dANCE!!!<br /><br />*************Random Updates**********************<br /><br />-\\"So Happy I Could Die\\" is also a favorite of mine and many other reviewers mention it as one of their favorites also if you read the (5) star reviews.<br /><br />- Two songs surfaced the internet, \\"Earthquake/Then You'd Love Me\\" & \\"Nothing On But The Radio\\". Both songs are heavily inspired by the sound of 80's Pop and Dance music. \\"Earthquake\\" has a trance or disco type undertone which is remeniscent of Kylie Minogue's late 80's songs, Such as her cover of \\"Better The Devil You Know\\" \\"Got 2 b Certain\\" and her rendtion of \\"Locomotion\\" to give you some ideas of what it sounds like, or better, Think Tiffany, \\"I Think We're Alone Now\\".<br /><br />- \\"Nothing On But The Radio\\" channels an 80's sound similar to but not exactly like Cameo's \\"Word Up\\" (for lack of better ideas). Lyrically The track is more along the lines of something from \\"The Fame\\", but musically the arrangment sounds NEW'r but doesn't particularly fit the theme of MONSTER.The Devil You Know\\" \\"Got 2 b Certain\\" and her rendtion of \\"Locomotion\\" to give you some ideas of what it sounds like, or better, Think Tiffany, \\"I Think We're Alone Now\\".    - \\"Nothing On But The Radio\\" channels an 80's sound similar to but not exactly like Cameo's \\"Word Up\\" (for lack of better ideas). Lyrically The track is more along the lines of something from \\"The Fame\\", but musically the arrangment sounds NEW'r but doesn't particularly fit the theme of MONSTER.

B001H5X7KC|4.0|I didnt think this movie would be that great when it was being previewed...but then my husband bought it and we watched it together, and it's seriously one of the funniest movies i've seen in a long time.  It strays away from the typical comedies, and is unique from any jack black or ben stiller comedy film.  You will be suprised at the humor, it's a little shocking at points.  I gave it 4 stars due to lots of filthy language, as a mom i had to wait untill the kids were in bed to watch it.  other than that i think this movie is definatly worth it!! Tom Cruise shows his very funny side...and his scenes will have you rolling on the floor.
0143116177|4.0|I watched the TV series and then read the book. The book is obviously structured after the TV series, and I do agree with some critical reviewers who think that this gives the book a \\"tellyish\\" flair. However in the book the author digs deeper and overall I think the outcome is fine. Again, those who expect a scientifically impeccable piece of work may be disappointed. In fact, even if at times some concepts get complicated, in general this book is thought for beginners or quasi-beginners. I truly enjoyed the chapter on the bond market, which I found extremely clear and well documented. I also enjoyed the chapter on the birth of the modern insurance business. On the contrary I thought the chapter on the origins of modern corporations on the one hand too elementary and on the other hand too focused on the Dutch East India Company and its story over the centuries - which eventually turn a bit tedious. Overall a very good book which I recommend.

1891252089|5.0|I just started taking Ashtanga classes at a local studio.  I asked my instructor for a recommendation to help me practice the asanas at home and this was what she directed me to.  It's perfect.    The book is designed well, meaning both the ease of using the spiral bound, and layout showing each pose in great detail.  David shows the pose in a clear photo, with written instructions on how to enter the pose.  Plus, he includes at least two modifications for every asana for those less flexible or with limitations preventing them from achieving the full pose.    Toward the end of the book he shows the \\"full flow\\" that shows snapshots of the pose in order for the Standing Series, Primary Series and Advanced.  He also has the flow of Sun Salutation A & B.  There are options for various vinyasa to plug in between the different asanas.  I'm a total beginner and have found this very easy to follow and not intimidating.  I feel I'll grow in my practice with this and use it throughout my Ashtanga education.
B00005JKLZ|5.0|Ignore all the bad reviews and comments about this movie. If you are like me, looking for an intelligent movie instead of the mindless drivel that 99% of the movies available provide, this movie is wonderful. It has a delightful ending which is very thought provoking. I also went back and watched the old time machine movie and found it to be boring and out dated. This new time machine movie brings up new and profound time continuum concepts. It emphasizes how important it is for us to try to get a glimpse of the future in order to understand what direction we should take in life. It even comments on the difference between short term self interests as opposed to long term community service. I guess in our narcissistic society obsessed with instant gratification, such noble and thought provoking  concepts just sail right on by. How far we have fallen.

1594488916|5.0|Bartlett, apart from telling the fascinating story of Gilkey's criminal obsession and eventual capture, implies that within all book lovers, even all collectors, lurks the capacity for thievery. Bartlett recounts in the first chapter that her foray into the world of book theft began with a rare book she borrowed from a friend, which she hung onto for six years before returning. Was this a form of book thievery, she questions. Surprisingly, more than one book collector has admitted, upon finding himself alone with a truly rare book in his possession, the temporary impulse to just simply pocket it.      \\"Whenever I have asked Gilkey to describe the allure books have for him, he struggles, but ultimately settles on the aesthetic.  'It's a visual thing, the way they look, all lined up on the shelf.'  He once suggested an almost sexual attraction to books.  'I don't know.  Maybe it's because I'm a man, but I like to look.'  ...    \\"Collectors talking about the books they have just acquired, or ones they haven't been able to get their hands on, or those snatched away by another collector, sound a lot like lotharios reminiscing about lovers.\\"        \\"Book lust\\" however seems to be quite apart from \\"book love.\\" Gilkey for instance steals in order to amass a collection to impress other people. During their first interview, Bartlett coaxes out of Gilkey a very revealing memory:      \\"'I used to watch those British Victorian movies, you know, like Sherlock Holmes.  I loved those movies where a gentleman has an old library, wears a smoking jacket.'      \\"Exploring his motives seemed to please Gilkey, but there was nothing revelatory about it: he seemed comfortable in this knowledge of himself, that his fantasy of living an old-fashioned, cultured English life as depicted on the big screen is what compelled him to steal books.      \\"'Watching those movies,' he said, 'that was when I first thought about getting books.'\\"      As an adult thief, the books Gilkey chooses to steal are dictated by the list of 100 best books in the Modern Library. Although he is clearly knowledgeable and educated about books, Gilkey seems seized by a mania for collecting physical objects, rather than by the intangible delights books offer.      \\"Something told me that for Gilkey, no matter how much money he had, it would never be enough for all the books he craved.  Sigmund Freud described collecting antiquities as \\"second only in intensity to nicotine addiction.\\"  He explained that the drive and pleasure in any kind of collecting comes from the sense of conquest.\\"      While I love owning and being surrounded by books, I am immensely more satisfied with the act of reading, discovering what is written on the page, rather than the effects my ownership of them produces in others. Except for my most beloved and re-read books, I don't mind giving away those I've already read.  And yet, do I not have another thing in common with Gilkey, the book thief, in that along with nice furniture and nicely framed art, I would think my house plain if it did not have shelves of hardcover spines to against the walls?      This book reveals a fascinating world about which many true book lovers probably know very little - the rare book trade can be a dirty business!  Most surprising of all are the parallels I've discovered between my love for books and Gilkey's motivations.  Bartlett weaves the stories of John Gilkey, bibliodick Ken Sanders (I would love to meet this guy- he is a hoot!), and other riveting stories of rare book theft in a way that reads like a crime novel.       Bartlett enters the story as well, as during the course of her years-long research, Gilkey somehow persuades her to accompany him to the scene of one of his crimes, a rare book store, and she and the book thief come face to face with one of his angry victims. To find out what happens - you just have to read this great book!
B001B6EAOY|1.0|Worked great for about the first 2 months, then my camera constantly tells me to \\"Reinsert the MemoryStick\\". I do that probably 5-10 times before it reads it properly. Also if you aren't using a Sony brand MemoryStick it will also say \\"this MemoryStick may not record or play\\" and the camera seems a little sluggish at startup. Bought a Sony MemoryStick.
B001GM28HO|5.0|For a long time, I had strayed away from pop music because I didn't like the direction it had gone. Then I heard Poker Face on the radio and I took a look at this album. It's so fresh, original, and catchy. Half the album is enjoyable to listen to. The first 5 tracks are great and memorable songs from the year 2008. She dominated. The rest of the album is very well produced. You'll find the entire album enjoyable if you liked her chart topping songs from the year. Strong recommendation.
B0026P3G12|3.0|I wish the album arrangers would have just let Susan sing backed up with a piano instead of a full orchestra. I love her voice and story so much and would have loved even to have her sing A cappella.
B001AVCFJM|3.0|Being a fan of TOS since I was a very young child (I first became enthralled when it got syndicated in the early 70s when I was in elementary school), I awaited to see how Star Trek could be \\"re-envisioned\\" as it was never something I thought needed to be revisited.  What this movie delivers is a bit like the original series itself, some good, some bad, some awesome and some just...meh.  My husband and I watched the DVD the day it came and then again two days later as we were really torn over the whole \\"newness\\" of it during the first viewing.  The second viewing definitely helped me better form my opinion.  Overall, the movie is a good basis for what I hope will be a whole series of new movies but it is very far from perfect.  This kind of feels like a pilot episode of a tv show.  You get the basic premise but the whole series direction is still very up in the air with fine-tuning to occur as the series progresses.<br /><br />The stuff that most definitely works.<br /><br />Karl Urban as Dr. Leonard McCoy.  In my opinion, the absolutely most perfect part of this film.  It was like watching a young DeForest Kelley.  I've liked Karl Urban since I first saw him in Xena and enjoyed him, as limited as his role was, in both The Two Towers and The Return of the King.  Never could I have imagined that someone could be Bones, other than the original beloved character, but Karl Urban nailed the role so perfectly it was absolutely unbelievable.  Two thumbs up and five stars for his outstanding performance.<br /><br />Simon Pegg as Montgomery Scott.  I hated Simon Pegg in Shawn of the Dead (the only other thing I've ever seen of his) and absolutely dreaded watching him massacre one of my favorite characters.  However, I was more than pleasantly surprised in his portrayal and very much enjoyed the new Mr. Scott.  Thank you Mr. Pegg for making such a fun and very true to character Scotty.  I look forward to more of the same.<br /><br />Chris Pine as Captain Kirk.  Wow.  I am actually surprised how much I have come to like the redone Kirk.  The first time I watched the movie I wasn't sure how much I liked the new Kirk.  After thinking about it, how Kirk would have been changed due to the difference in his upbringing with a loving father to one with a cold and unlikable stepfather and his removal from the original Kirk's early life, I realized that Chris Pine has very much created a Kirk who is believable in his changed circumstances but still retaining the basis for a Kirk to care about and want more of.  Cocky, slightly angry but with the basic core of the cowboy diplomat we have long known and loved.<br /><br />Bruce Greenwood as Captain Pike.  Really enjoyed his portrayal of Captain (now Admiral) Pike and thought his character was well portrayed and liked his inclusion.<br /><br />The stuff that mostly works.<br /><br />Anton Yelchin as Chekov.  Still having a hard time with this character.  I liked the enthusiasm and I liked the energy but it was hard to get over the complete lack of similarity to Walter Koenig in either looks or characterization.  He just did not feel like Chekov to me.  And I'm not even going to go into the hair.  He may grow on me...hopefully not in a fungus sort of way.  I will reserve judgment for the next movie.<br /><br />Zoe Saldana as Uhura.  Pretty but not as exotic looking as Nichelle Nichols, this redone Uhura has promise.  She has the intelligence of the first Uhura but is more sassy and aggressive (well, most of the time).  Like Chekov, I'll wait for the next movie to decide yay or nay.  I think I like her, but part of my holding back is discussed below in stuff I just didn't like.<br /><br />The stuff that mostly didn't work for me.<br /><br />John Cho as Sulu.  His portrayal of Sulu feels as bland a bowl of cooked pasta compared to a serving of lasagne.  Something was just missing.  Sulu was never boring or bland.  He might not have been considered a major character for most episodes but George Takei's Sulu was always interesting in my opinion.  I personally wish that James Kyson Lee could have been released from Heroes long enough to take this role because Ando is probably about my favorite character on that show and Mr. Lee would have been able to make Sulu work so much better than John Cho did.<br /><br />The stuff that didn't work for me.<br /><br />Zachary Qunito as Spock.  He has the look but goes through the movie with a smirk and an overwhelming show of emotion that is just so not Spock.  Kirk is the one whose entire childhood and adolescence was changed, not Spock.  Quinto plays Spock like he's channeling Sylar on meds.  Only at the very last couple of minutes of the movie does he come close.  Please, oh please, make him watch those few minutes over and over in preparation for the next movie and smack him with a rolled-up newspaper if he tries to portray Spock as he did through most of this one.  If nothing else, please, whatever you do, get rid of the storyline issue that I mention below.<br /><br />The stuff that so didn't work its not even funny.<br /><br />The Enterpise.  Why does this new Enterprise look like the Motion Picture version mated with a pregnant guppy, given the Andy Warhol treatment and then had botox injections?  The engine nacelles are absolutely hideous and are the worst part of this nightmarish reimagining of our beloved Enterprise.  The interior just doesn't work, some stuff way too futuristic looking for the time period and some stuff way too antiquated for the time period.  Try to get a little closer to the feel of the Enterprise from the horrid Enterprise series from a few years ago to at least make it tolerable.  Somebody needs to fire whoever came up with this design and get a real Star Trek designer in there for the next movie.  And what's with the bizarre engine noises when the Enterprise is flying?<br /><br />and the other thing that doesn't work....<br /><br />(SPOILER - FOR ANYONE WHO HASN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE)<br /><br />And last but not least, the Spock-Uhura romance.  Okay.  Ick.  The lovey-dovey smooching on the transporter before they beamed over to Nero's ship made me want to turn off the movie or throw up (not sure in which order).  I get that Uhura is interested in Spock in this movie and Spock has the hots for her too.  This is a face/palm situation if I've ever seen one.  I rolled my eyes at my husband when we first watched it and he had the exact same reaction.  This is just not working at all.  Uhura with Kirk, yes.  Uhura with Scotty even (from the ST-V movie).  But Spock with Uhura?????  Uh, no.  Even worse is that its protrayed like they are maybe 10 years old in a sickly sweet, get-me-my-insulin kind of relationship that is just completely unbelievable.e could have been released from Heroes long enough to take this role because Ando is probably about my favorite character on that show and Mr. Lee would have been able to make Sulu work so much better than John Cho did.

185984054X|5.0|Hitchens writes with clarity, and an eye for brevity.  This is a poignant look at the way that an image can overwhelm a society so much that it takes an author like Hitchens to point out what should have been obvious to everyone.  It takes Hitchens less than a hundred pages to point out the hypocritical stances, and the cruelty of the one know as Mother Teresa.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|A beautifully written story much like the many movie and theatre versions you may have seen over the years.  The characters are so interesting and memorable.  The story focuses so much more on Scrooge than any screen version I've seen and I enjoyed it more for that.  It is a wonderful Christmas Classic.
B001AVCFK6|4.0|I'm not a Trekkie, but I grew up watching the reruns of the old show and the original movies in the 80s.  What makes Star Trek what it is for me are the characters.        While the reboot idea here is probably good for the long-run to take these established characters to new adventures, some things feel out of place big time.  The old Spock angle was used in Generations with Kirk instead.   I'm a huge Leonard Nimoy fan but cameos are a really lazy way to advance the series.  Just tell an original story.  How hard is it really?  I did like the young actors for the most part.  The script lacks the characterizations of Star Trek IV or the nifty plot of Star Trek VI.   I would rank this one somewhere in the middle of the whole collection.  In short, Star Trek is fun without being overly engaging.    Hopefully the next film will have a more solid script with some good science and some good ORIGINAL fiction.      The Blu-Ray presentation is fantastic and ranks with The Dark Knight and Transformers on quality viewing on my Panasonic Plasma.  Sound too is really crisp on my surround sound.  There are plenty of behind the scenes featurettes, which are decent, but I found the commentary to be pretty run-of-the-mill.  I stopped listening to it about half way through.     So as another review here has said, its a fun movie.  Yet not really a great Star Trek movie.  But the Blu-Ray is still a great purchase and a sight to behold if you have the screen to show it off.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|This is one of the best movies of 2009 - a real sleeper.  The acting is great and the storyline is unusual.  Recommended for anyone who thinks they have found \\"the one\\".  Get the soundtrack as well.
B000ZN8036|4.0|This item was purchased to supplement a novel unit of the same name.  The movie is an excellent adaptation of the novel, not something often said from my mouth, however the \\"R\\" rating may make it difficult to show in class.  The nudity scenes are easily skipped, without causing detriment to the movie.  The movie highlights the most important part of the novel, while not losing the voice and randomness that Krakauer created in the novel.  I would gladly recommend the movie to anyone.
B0017MO10U|4.0|STARGATE: ARK OF TRUTH more or less wrapped up the Ori portion of SG-1 and STARGATE: CONTINUUM does pretty much the same thing with the Gou'ald arc.  I think this is appropriate, given that the Gou'ald started off the movie that anticipated the series.  There aren't a lot of Gou'ald left at this point, only Ba'al. But at least they go out with a bang, with an innovative, fun, interesting story.  The first two post-SG-1 movies have not been masterpieces, but they have both been very good.  This is no mean feat.  If you contrast it with the various BABYLON 5 movies, the SG-1 movies have been far superior.  This despite the fact that BABYLON 5 was a far more impressive show.  The two SG-1 movies have been so successful that a third is now in the works.<br /><br />Hopefully that movie will have more involvement with my favorite member of the SG-1 team, Claudia Black.  I'm not quite certain where her pregnancy fell in the filming schedule, whether she had it immediately before filming or if she had it afterwards, but it did mean that she was not fully available.  Her diminished role hurt the show some.  I always felt that SG-1 improved sharply as soon as she joined the series.  She brought both a sexiness and some humor that had been missing before she arrived.  Hopefully she will play a much more prominent role in this film.<br /><br />The financial success of these two movies are great news for SF fans everywhere, even if they don't follow SG-1.  The DVD industry hasn't quite figured out what to do with direct-to-DVD.  There are a lot of niche markets that could support direct-to-DVD films.  The success of the SG-1 films might, for instance, mean that long hoped for sequel to SERENITY (though the ongoing success of various cast members -- Nathan Fillion, Summer Glau, Gina Torres, Adam Baldwin, and, most recently as main face of the alien invaders on V. [though she also had a prominent role on SG-1], Morena Baccarin].  ARK OF TRUTH and CONTINUUM have proved -- along with the two BSG releases -- that direct to DVD can make a profit.leases -- that direct to DVD can make a profit.
B0014I4KH6|5.0|Taylor is an amazingly talented young woman and her music is appropriate for all ages.  My 3 sons sing along to her cd's in my car and they are 8, 6 and 5 and they know the words by heart....  I would recommend this cd to anyone!
B000683VI4|3.0|Have plenty of kleenex ready before watching this movie.  You will need it at the end.  The build up is a study in bad chemistry.  The two seem not made for each other, but they go against all to prove everyone wrong.  A normal person would just walk away so many different times.  I wonder if one of the characters were abusive whether this would be the same movie?  See it for yourself - it is worth watching at least once.  Then decide for yourself.
0385341008|5.0|Written in an interesting, captivating Letter Writing format!<br />Character development works well in this format.<br />It teaches in an informal way, as well as entertains the reader.<br />I liked it so much, I have given copies as gifts to friends and family.<br />Even the title, unusual as it is, draws you in and keeps you focused!<br />So, if you enjoy the lost art of letter writing, and have even a passing interest in history, you too will enjoy this book!
B0026P3G12|5.0|I love this CD!  While I think she could have given it a bit more punch, all in all, I am very pleased with the CD.  Yes, she has room to grow, but then don't we all!  Go Susan!
B002SJIO54|5.0|This was a totally unexpected movie... the greatest Sci Fi I've seen in a long time. It was so unexpected that I made the mistake of sitting very close to the screen. One advice, if you go see it, sit in the back row, or you will get dizzy... But nevertheless it was GREAT!!!
B001FB55HQ|4.0|The Terminator story line is getting a little long in the tooth.  But, if you bought in from the beginning you have to see this latest edition.  It could be done so much better, but at least we see the story progress...or regress as the case may be.  Any \\"Terminator\\" fan has to see this one as well.
B0027BOL4G|4.0|Food Inc exposes the incredible facade of the American food industry that is now dominating the world. As I write this, I am currently living in Korea and am seeing first hand how the US meat industry has come over here and bombarded the naturally low in meat ( and VERy high in veg) Korean diet. Dairy, where before was not consumed, is now widely eaten and imported chicken has become popular ( there are so many fried chicken restaurants here). Many of my husband's students get sick easily and are getting very portly.<br />But Food inc exposes other huge problems that the Future of Food did: how GMOs are infiltrating the world's food system, and the patent to these mutated seeds is Monsanto.<br />The bottom line is that people are being lied to, workers abused, laws broken, and severe animal cruelty is being perpetuated by these US super companies and protected by the US ( and other) governments.<br />I highly recc everyone watches Food Inc and PLEASE check out Food Matters and the  Future of food for even more info.<br />BUY ORGANIC, BUY ONLY WILD FISH OR MEAT OR ORGANIC, OR BECOME VEG.
B002I6251G|3.0|I have no problem with Editors trying something new, and was excited at the prospect of them experimenting with synths. Quite frankly, I felt their first album was much better than the 2nd, which felt too \\"Coldplay\\" for me.   The problem with the new album is not that I don't like electronic music, it's just that they don't seem to know how to do it that well (probably since they never have before). The songwriting, both lyrically and musically has really taken a step backward. Also, Editors ARE good at writing guitar based music and had a very good sound...sadly, there is virtually NO guitar here. Again, this would be OK if they were masters of electronic music or had come up with some amazing songs...but they are not playing to their strengths here, as one reviewer said. The album is not a total failure...it is intriguing simply in that they are doing something unexpected, and there are a few decent tracks here. Hopefully with the next album they either ditch the electronic sound, OR get really good at it and bring some better songwriting to the studio. By all means, give this album a shot, but I have the feeling that Editors could do much better in the future, and hopefully they will.
1881273873|5.0|I have totally enjoyed this book, this is a book a parent or a dear friend could give to someone to help them more fully realize how good life can get.If you have any spare time at all - get it read it and pass it along
B002SJIO4A|5.0|A really good science fiction movie.  The beginning is a little rough, but you cannot stop watching and by the end you realize that you have just seen a damn good movie.  The symbolism is so transparent, but watch the movie for entertainment purposes and you won't be disappointed.
B0026P3G12|3.0|I must admit when i saw Susan Boyle i thought wow this is a very unattractive lady and figured well she doesnt stand a change mainly for that reason. When she opened her mouth and that voice came out of that body, i thought wow i was totally wrong. Still as American Shallow, or British idol or any other show out there, appearance is mainly what they look at before the person sings, i've seen great singers turned down for that very reason. When Simons jaw dropped as they show on TV 100 times a week, i thought well what are you gonne do now. The album while mostly covers is pretty good, but being i'm a metal/rock person, not really my cup of capacino. Silent Night was done very well, but i still have to go with Enyas older version she did all in her homelands language it was totally angelic, and has yet to be beaten. But the majority of the album is pretty much midpaced music, with all the power and prestige going to her voice. Which really is the point anyway. Why do i give the album 3 stars? Well heres why. I am a drummer, and i also sing, i was in two bands, one of them signed (Byzantine). We worked hard for years to get almost absolutely nothing in the way of money(which isnt what music should be about). Try as hard as we can and our label Prosthetic Records would not push us or our touring, and give us any funding at all. The thing i hate about these shows, AI, BR, is that you dont have to work hard and bust your butt for years to achieve anything. If they like you boom, record deal, and even if not, you still have a shot because your in front of the whole world and they basically choose if you go or stay. Well i consider myself and my band mates extremely talented, and while we got to play and even meet a lot of long time bands we looked up to from being kids, we fell apart because the lack of promotion, and funds. Well i guess if they had a Heavy Metal idol, we would have been ok. Point being even if you don't look the part, but you have the talent, \\"most\\" people will like you. But in the end even Susan Boyles great voice won't make it, because this is a business, and when the music industry starts calling the shots, and making her decisions, watch out Susan. She will crash and burn, she almost already had a nervous breakdown because the media wouldnt leave her be. So while Susan Boyle has an amazing set of lungs, it takes much more than that to make it in this business, and thats something i know she won't be able to handle. Picture her on a world tour, come on, i don't think so. Nothing lasts if you don't work hard and for many years at it, hand outs are given but quickly taken away.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|Wonderful Album with some traditional songs done with a little different arrangement and some new songs.  Wonderful listening and soothing for quiet time.
0151008787|5.0|There are 54 reviewers who recorded their thoughts before mine. So, my review includes some comments on those reviews.     I found the book to be very fascinating because I am very curious about Jews as people and Israel as a country. Amos Oz has gone through events that few people go through in their life ... the most difficult one is his mother's suicide. The story is told in a radiating style with his mother's suicide being the focus. Events either flow towards it or away from it. It is not easy to tell such a difficult, painful story. Amos Oz tells it very effectively and virtually takes you into his life. His prose is so beautiful. He is also very humorous.     As many commented, this book is not completely autobiographical. A bulk of it is on his childhood years. He was in kibbutz for nearly 35 years starting from when he was nearly 15, but less than one third of the book is devoted to it. While so much detail is shared with readers about his reading habits, the people influenced him, etc., the life-changing decision he made with respect to joining kibbutz is told as if he woke up one day and decided to do it. There is no detail on how he found out about it, what he thought about it initially, and how he ultimately came up with the conviction.     Someone has mentioned that there are nothing but street names in the first 70 pages and the book was so boring they could not continue. I feel sorry for the person because he missed the best parts of the book. Even in the first 70 pages, there are a number of events of interest. In fact the most poetical paragraph in the book is in the first 70 pages which describes how his mother acted in the presence of a famous writer (Agnon).
B001FBSMW6|4.0|I've always been a fan of Keane, and their music has always been of such high quality that I was able to rate both of their first two albums five stars. While I can't do the same with their latest album Perfect Symmetry, it's still a great album.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000268QB2 Hopes and Fears]] helped the trio usher in their own version of piano rock, and [[ASIN:B000FBHT1C Under the Iron Sea]] made things even more interesting due to Tim relying on electric pianos and synthesizers. But things changed as soon as \\"Spiralling\\" hit the speakers. Not only did the music sound so different that I didn't even know this was Keane, but when I saw them perform this on Ellen, I was like, \\"A guitar? WHAT?\\" Yep, as other reviewers have said, that song sounds more like an `80s new wave song, but in contrast to what negative reviewers have said, ALL the songs aren't like that; in fact, the only other song that really IS is \\"You Haven't Told Me Anything\\" (by the way, this is another one of those cases where I looked at the one-star reviews and now I'm wondering if those are the kind of reviewers that think one star and five stars are the only options).<br /><br />Anyway, there are plenty of highlights that sound like standard Keane, like \\"You Don't See Me\\", \\"Black Burning Heart\\" and \\"Again and Again\\". And although the quasi-sexual \\"Pretend That You're Alone\\" might not work for everyone, I think it's good. In fact, the only real misstep is \\"Better Than This\\", where the chorus \\"you can do so much better than this\\" took the words right out of my mouth. Still, despite the slight change in sound, Perfect Symmetry is on point.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B00005JA2B|5.0|This is Kansas's best cd full of great songs.Highly recomend it for any Kansas fan or a new fan
B000HT3P7E|5.0|I agree with most of what has been said by the other reviewers.  This show is one of the best on TV right now and Neil Patrick Harris deserves to win an Emmy for his role as Barney.  I think this show is the best for people that are around 30 years old because so much of the show is relevant to us.  I definitely recommend this show to anyone in that age group that likes to laugh!  Season one is great at introducing all the characters and getting you to like them and get into the story right away.
B0021L8UPS|5.0|This was my favorite movie of the summer of 2009, and I saw roughly 20 films.  I am not a horror movie fan but something about this film intrigued me...\\"there's something wrong with Esther\\"...that made me get up and go see it in the theaters.  I absolutely loved this film.  I thought each of the actors played their role perfectly in this film, particularly our leading star whose name I cannot recall as I'm writing this.  Vera Farmiga also does a particularly fine job and I wish she was in more leading roles, herself as I think she's quite talented.  This particular DVD comes with footage of an alternate ending which I somewhat liked better than that shown in the final cut, along with some deleted scenes which I suppose are worth watching once.      I rate this film (and DVD) five stars and give it my highest recommendation as a horror film/thriller and more importantly, as a movie laden with memorable lines by Esther like \\"There...its in Heaven now...\\" or \\"Going somewhere Kate...?\\"  Heh heh.     Enjoy!
B002MCJZHS|4.0|Simply great album from the very first track to the last.  Think twangy surf guitar with a hint of Mazzy Star.  Both of their voices are dreamy and subtle with their lyrics being painfully beautiful. Stand out tracks for me were Intro, Crystalised, Shelter and Stars.
0307454541|4.0|A unique book, with a unique plot.  I have never read anything quite like this, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Well written.  Page turner
B0026P3G12|3.0|There is no doubt that Susan Boyle has a beautiful voice and I purchased this CD today hoping I would fall in love with it. All of the songs are sung beautifully, but there isn't enough variety to the music in it. Songs which were previously recorded (by the Rolling Stones, Monkees, Madonna) just don't lend themselves well to the ballads Susan has chosen to sing. I have a collection of CD's I use to help me to sleep on sleepless nights and this will lend itself perfectly for that purpose....to just pop in my cd player at home or in the car and listen from start to finish....not so much.
0307386171|4.0|This is the story of a moment in time, a few hours really, and its consequences. The story takes place on the wedding night of a young couple, Florence and Edward. They are staying at a small hotel on Chesil Beach, and when the time comes to consummate the marriage, well, let's just say there is a misunderstanding. This is prudish, pre-sexual-revolution Britain, the incident is blown out of proportion, and the fears and frustrations of Edward and Florence, the same fears and frustrations of any young couple just married, manifest themselves in a pointless and stubborn argument.<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about this book. Most of it, the part that leads up to and surrounds the incident itself, I found quite boring. McEwan's writing is solid, but the Victorian sensibility of it all just isn't my thing. But the last part of the book, when Edward is looking back on the incident many years later and thinking about how that one small moment had such a large impact on his life--that part's really moving and relatable and masterfully executed. And it made the rest of the book worth it.<br /><br />On Chesil Beach is the first McEwan I've read, but from what I've heard, it deals with a favorite topic of his--how small events, even the ones that don't feel like events at the time, can change everything. It's little more than a short story, really, which is the perfect length for it. If the upfront required much more investment, I'm not sure I would recommend this book. But as it is, I found it to be a quick and powerful read.
0547258305|5.0|I purchased this book long before I read it. I like the cover, but for some reason I just kept putting it off. I didn't think I would like it, I guess, so I read a bunch of other books before it. One day I got sick, I stayed home and got bored and thought I could give it a chance. It took me maybe a day and a half, and in the end I was in love.     Katsa, a strong minded graceling, has been given the grace of killing. She struggles her everyday against the horrible grace she possesses, not wanting to be the killer everyone sees her as. Her uncle, the King, has a much different plan for Katsa. He sees her as an advantage against his enemies, and against criminals in his own kingdom. Sending her out to punish people around the kingdom he does not realize, nor would he have cared, that he is making her resent herself and her power more each day.  Finally Katsa meets someone, another graceling, who can show her the beauty in the gift she has been given.     Katsa's self loathing is, I believe, realistic. She hates who she has to be, and sees no way around it. At first I thought this story would be a basic 'female warrior who saves the kingdom from the bad man' kind of book, but it is so much more. Katsa grows up and blooms in this book. Kristin Cashore takes a strong female protagonist, and amazingly makes her even stronger. Kristin has created a girl who is real, even if she lives in a fantasy world. She is not so strong that she never gets upset or needs help, but she is strong enough that she can take care of herself and learn to love herself.    I think Kristin has taken a look at the life of real teenage girls, put them into this beautiful character, and come out with the conclusion that everyone can be strong and beautiful they just have to trust and love themselves.

B0026P3G12|5.0|What a shame that there are those so mean minded that they deliberately give Miss Boyle low rating out of some kind of spite.  No worries.  This album is absolutely stunning.  Her voice is a power to be reckoned with.  My favorites are \\"You'll See\\"  \\"Who I Was Born to Be\\" (this should have a Grammy nomination next year), and \\"Proud\\"  For a first time album it is remarkable.  There are no \\"throw aways\\" as in most albums.  I recommend it unconditionally.

B002KSPKRS|5.0|I had the Trittons. You can see my review of them on Amazon. They broke. I am so happy they did. I now have a superior headset. And its wireless! They are lighter. They fit better. They sound better. And yes, if the microwave, 6 florescent lights, a fan, my cell phone, and a deathray are all on at the same time- right next to the transmitter... They will sound like there is a radio frequency issue.<br /><br />Realistically, the range is not 30 feet. I would stay withing 20 to be safe. Once out of range, they make a sound like your ears are popping.<br /><br />Yes, they do make static when plugging/unplugging the mic plugs. All plugs make that sound. Stchhhhh. Done. Its plugged in, no more noise.<br /><br />Yes, if I stand just the right way, I can hear a buzz when the headphone wire is plugged in. Only when the wire is in. I can move and it goes away. Or, I can just wait till there is any sound from the game. It is not loud. It is not ALWAYS there. It is not a big deal. So many people come here only to complain. I love this headset.<br /><br />There is only two speakers total. Somehow they paint a better picture than the Trittons. I can not only hear all around with the X41s, but they tell me what is above and below too.<br /><br />It is a radio, it will have imperfections. Just as if you shift on the couch with a wired headset. Move the wire, get static. Play right next to the microwave, get static.<br /><br />If people would take 3 minutes to read the instructions... It outlines all that stuff. Best locations for the transmitter... and all sorts things. It is quite a lengthy manual.<br /><br />These phones are flawless. Please take a moment to view my review of the Trittons before making a decision between the two. (focus on the \\"edit\\" portion)It is not like comparing shade of blue... but rather, types of paint. Oils generally look better than watercolors. The X41s are generally better than the Ax Pros. Period.<br /><br />I would like to thank the Turtles for opening my eyes, or should I say, ears, to a better world.<br /><br />Amen.<br /><br />(Update:)<br /><br />The - La Crosse Technology BC-9009 AlphaPower Battery Charger - has solved the loud buzz before shutdown due to dead batteries... For some reason, with rechargeable, there is no banging buzz. It just stops. Suddenly in fact. Get the charger, keep your plugs clean, and you will love this headset. Also, if you choose to message me on XBL (BluntAttack) please include something that lets me know you would like to discuss either the Trittons or the X41s...<br /><br />Happy hunting, see you in \\"Underpass\\" - don't forget your \\"Coldblooded Perk\\".  :PAmen.

1554681723|4.0|This book was a gift to my daughter from her future in-laws.  They know we love dogs, have 2 collies, and that my daughter is a veterinary nurse.  I read it on a road trip in 1 sitting.  Won't give any spoilers, and many reviewers have written excellent reviews of this work already.<br /><br />I enjoyed the story told from the perspective of the dog Enzo.  Enzo learned from a TV program that Mongolians believe when worthy dogs die, their souls return in human incarnations.  Enzo believes this will happen to him, so he studies his human family intensely in order to be ready.  This is the underlying basis for Enzo's narrative.<br /><br />The story is a tear-jerker, yes.  The prose is clear and simple (many people disliked it but I thought it was necessary, since a dog was narrating; florid prose would have detracted a lot).  The actions of some of the characters is perhaps not terribly plausible to many of us, but if you read carefully, you will discover the authors gives us clues as to why those characters act the way they do (I'd write more details but I promised no spoilers).<br /><br />My preferred rating would be 3 1/2 stars; I gave it 4 because I liked it more than I was indifferent to it.

B0026P3G12|5.0|What a rich voice.  Susan Boyle has an amazing control over her voice.  It slides up/down, over, and around the words. I doubt anyone hearing this album would equate the performer to the video of her audition on Britain's Got Talent.  What we all heard and saw then was a powerful performance suitable for the stage.  In this album, that power is harnessed and presented as an intimate one-on-one performance.  There is touches of the torch singer, of the Gospel singer, and of the multitude of singers that have lasted over the decades.  It is not background music.  Each song is too poignant, too real. You can actually understand the words.  The album is beautifully crafted, the sound mixing well done so as to not overshadow the performer.  I look forward to more albums.  This one is perfect for that quiet, intimate evening before the fire.
1594202249|5.0|I have not treated Pynchon's latest novel as a \\"beach read\\" as some reviewers on amazon describe it.  Thomas Pynchon is America's greatest living author and one of its greatest writers ever.  His is a true late modern voice who follows Fitzgerald and leads us by the hand into hyperreality.  Completing his California trilogy (CoLot49, Vineland, now IV), Pynchon's new protagonist, Larry \\"Doc\\" Sportello is a deconstruction of Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe and Dashiell Hammet's Sam Spade.  He is not hard edged, or tough - he's Karmic.    If that doesn't sound of interest to you, perhaps there's a new vampire or wizard book coming out?    Anyway, if you are considering reading this book, read the reviews offered by the New Yorker or NYT - not some 12 year olds pretending they read books like these on Amazon.
B002QEXN2K|5.0|I really enjoy this album.  It took a few listens for me to grasp how good it is but after that I can listen to the whole CD from begining to end and I love every song.  It is a mellow CD and is different from Continum because it doesn't have a blues edge to it, he went in a totally different direction which I respect.  If you are a fan of John Mayer then you will love this CD.
B0028K3192|5.0|Maxwell is my favorite male singer, lately I have been rocking to Ne-yo because Maxwell was not around. When I say this cd was worth the wait...that is an understatement. I love it so much and my biggest gripe is that it's not long enough in my opinion. For the amount of time I had to wait I expected a double cd or at least 20 songs on one cd...something...but with him its about the quality not the quantity so I can't complain to much since he has once again blessed us with great music. It is still constant in my cd player and I don't see that changing anytime soon. Ready for the next album already...

B000I0QK74|5.0|For those up in arms about \\"At Christmas\\" being a minor reworking of his Hallmark \\"A Christmas Album\\" from '04, well, this is not unique.  Barry Manilow did it with his '07 Hallmark Christmas release as has George Strait and Michael McDonald (well parts of his Hallmark effort): I assume it is part of the agreement between Hallmark and the arists. And it makes sense: it would be a shame if this wonderful CD had only been available during one Christmas season and, believe it or not, there are JT fans out there who don't shop at Hallmark and missed it.       I have the Hallmark version PLUS the extra tracks from the Columbia release: \\"River\\", which at one point was available as a free download from Taylor's web-site, and \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" (a track from 2002's excellent [[ASIN:B00006ADZD October Road]]). Both are great additions to the original release but there is a downside: they did drop Taylor's pleasant version of \\"Deck the Halls\\" when compiling this CD.  Too bad they didn't retain it: there certainly is space available on the CD.     Still for James Taylor fans either recording will be a winner. For the most part this is Taylor the \\"pop\\" singer, not the \\"'70s singer-songwriter\\", but it certainly works and James is at the top of his game vocally. Most of the tracks are given the typical arrangement you would find on any of his releases from the last decade or two, meaning James doesn't really \\"rock\\" on this CD, if anything he gently swings like on \\"Santa Clause is Coming to Town\\" and \\"Winter Wonderland\\". Although he does get a bit \\"bluesy\\" on his unique, must-hear arrangement of \\"Jingle Bells\\". A real highlight for me, and others apparently, is \\"Baby It's Cold Outside\\" with a playful and flirty Natalie Cole. I just love the interaction between James and Natalie on this track which is one of the best versions ever recorded. (If you want more Natalie I also recommend [[ASIN:B00001SIC4 Magic of Christmas]] and [[ASIN:B000002HGK Holly & Ivy]].)Often contemporary artists release Christmas CDs that just don't work for the simple reason that the artist and the material are simply not a good match.  But here Taylor's voice and delivery works beautifully with this holiday music. Recommended.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|People tend to forget that they are listening to and watching history when they see Paul Mcartney perform.  I first saw Paul during his 1976 Wings Over America tour and I  have seen him numerous times since. Each time that I have attended one of his concerts it is an unique experience, the last was on his current tour at Fed Ex Field in DC.  Except for 1 song the playlist was the same as the Good Evening New York City concert.  The only thing that I can say is that I was simply blown away by his performance it has to rank as the most remarkable concert that I have ever attended.  And without a doubt his new CD captures the concert and the overall sound expericence at an unbelieveable level.  Those who have never seen Paul buy the CD and if he ever tours again make sure that you try and attend.  I can assure you will not regert it.
B00004W3L3|5.0|Misplaced Childhood was released by Marillion in 1985 as their 3rd studio album following their debut Script For A Jester's Tear (1983) and Fugazi (1984). Fugazi is considered by many to be their strongest, more diverse release with songs rather than fragments but Misplaced Childhood carries certain strength and originality I am really attracted to. It was to be the one before last studio album of Marillion with Fish as vocalist. Neither their last common album nor the many albums coming out of the separate ways of both Marillion and Fish, in my mind exceeded the greatness of Fugazi and Misplaced Childhood.<br />Misplaced Childhood is a sort of a fragmented story with many different topics going on, but do not try to find too much underlying meaning in the concept, as it was a fruit of an acid overdose by Fish...at the pretty bad time for him personally. He was on tour and dealing with the break up with his long term girlfriend as well as the death of his friend whom the album was dedicated to. The overall concept although extremely poetic and confusing seems to have forgiveness to self and rejection of war as main themes somehow coming out of it. 'I will wear your white feather, I will carry your white flag, I will swear I have no nation, 'cos I'm proud to own my heart' becomes the most important final statement Fish leaves us behind.<br />Musically this album is a sort of a fragmented rock opera with hardly enough music to carry everything the vocalist wants to express. It is a very even album and it should be listen continuously as a concept album it is, but my most favorite parts are Blind Curve, a long suite composed of 5 parts and Lavender. The climate of this entire album is, to me at least, one of a kind.

The next night, i watched it and as it began, to my amazement, it also has closed captioning! Dumb Subtitles, Theater Subtitles ANNNDD Closed Captioning!! It seems to be Theatrical version Closed Captioning.    With many months of waiting, i can say this was worth the wait. i truly enjoyed it. I read the book before i even seen the movie and i'm glad i did. The book has far more details and my roommate felt that the movie was cut too much that it didnt provided enough flow. but in short: i still think this is a great movie.
B00004T9VY|5.0|This was Cat Steven's masterpiece and a lot of us had this album recorded on tape with his Teaser And The Firecat on side B. That is how we used to listen to music many years ago so we would not damage our albums (just some extra info you can shock your parents with). Cat Stevens had a huge following because the music of his songs was as powerful as the meaning of his lyrics. Both were simple and beautiful. It all seemed to flow straight out of Cat's heart and the inspiration had started after a serious illness tied him down to a London hospital for a period of many months. Success followed Cat Stevens and showered him and many around him with riches. However, Cat Stevens seemed not strong enough to be able to live the life of stardom and not let the emptiness which comes with it to affect his balanced core (as is often the case).The balance had broken, like the morning has broken and one day, while drowning in the Pacific Ocean he asked God for help, and promised to work towards God's glory if saved. Apparently a huge wave came out of nowhere and carried our singer to shore. That was the beginning of the end, because Cat Stevens meant his promise quite literally, unfortunately for the millions of fans who could have used the perfect way of transmission of his simple golden words. On the other hand, quite frankly, rare are these humans (and it very well may have a lot to do with how unaffected by their so called success they become) whose power of creation doesn't fade away. Personally I find a lot of his later albums without the spirit of Tea For The Tillerman. Perhaps it was time for him to focus on other things in life. I have purchased his music under the Yusuf Islam name and did not find much in it, either. Perhaps I was not able to come up to its level. However, I respect him as a human being tremendously, and I think that when we pull his songs we used to cover out of new editions of our albums and when we start pretending that he did not exist simply because he switched out of our way of life, that is purely a sign of our insecurity and hypocrisy. Remember - we are supposed to be the guardians of freedom. My favorite songs of Cat Stevens are the following: Sad Lisa, The Wind, Where Do The Children Play, Father And Son, If I Laugh, Monshadow, Where Are You, O Caritas, Hard Headed Woman, Oh Very Young, Morning Has Broken, Wild World, Lillywhite, But I Might Die Tonight, Rubbylove, Sitting, Miles From Nowhere, Peace Train, On The Road To Find Out, Northern Wind, Trouble, Longer Boats, Lady D'Arbanville.he switched out of our way of life, that is purely a sign of our insecurity and hypocrisy.

B000O75F7C|5.0|Fear Of The Blank Planet is definitely a concept album. We all agree with that. So what is the concept? It is an album about a teenager who told his doctor he was having problems falling asleep, received a prescription medication which altered his perception and attitude towards life. Or is it about something deeper? This album combines the hard sound with an equally heavy tone of the message the music carries with it. It is sad, depressing but it only fascinates and involves us so much because we know that the picture painted by Steven Wilson can be found in so many family albums of the 21st century and the problem becomes more prevalent every year. Sure, Steven is painting a picture which is a bit of a worse case scenario, but 'sullen and bored the kids stay' more and more in our culture of video games, reality tv, bad movies and a drug industry equal in power to our congress, with a cure for every mood we feel. Our disappearing walks in the park or a forest or at the beach, unread books by even Mark Twain, Hesse and Dostoyevsky, and an overall lack of focus on a big picture of life which we seem to be too busy and distracted for...affect our children. Steven is bringing our attention to this fact from the eyes of our kids hoping that such vision could open our own eyes. Perhaps next time we see our child glued to a video game we can visualize the outcome of such upbringing. I had read somewhere that Steven's concept was influenced by a book called Lunar Park. So I have read that book (no, I stopped 4/5 into it, it was not worth another evening) and I seriously doubt there is any truth in that, and reading such books is just a step away from watching a reality show - a complete waste of time. The music of Fear Of A Blank Planet is very even. However, being one of those long time lovers of Porcupine Tree I miss their gentler side (The Incident brought more of it back to a growing crowd of us) and my favorite songs here are The Ashes, Sentimental, Way Out Of Here and Anesthetize for its emotional values and Sleep Together for Richard's incredible ending. But that only leaves the title song and that is a great song, we all agree.<br />So appropriate it was for Steven to bring Alex Lifeson along to contribute towards this album. Such brilliant move increases the size of our crowd introducing new fans to the work they can appreciate, but it also brings along a man whose words are perfectly placed to become a motto we can all relate to after listening to The Fear Of A Blank Planet: 'life is just a candle and a dream must give it flame'. And by dream I don't mean wishing away....<br /><br />I have a bit of wishing away of my own... First of all, I would like to add that keyboards parts are fantastic. I can hear Richard Barbieri's sounds of organic keyboards building up under the radar, adding to landscapes making us so dependent and hooked on this music. The final moments of the album are fantastic. I am a big fan of Richard Barbieri's from his time with Japan, David Sylvan and their Rain Tree Crow and I have to say that I am patiently waiting for a day when I could hear a few songs of Porcupine Tree with David Sylvan as guest musician and vocalist singing along Steven Wilson, or vice versa.

B00004CYVZ|4.0|I'm going to order this on Amazon, because I'm sending my Netflix copy back to them since 30 minutes into the movie it's impossible to watch.  It stops, puts out digital squares and finally covers itself in green digital colors.  My only worry is that like reviewer Gerald Hopkins said his doesn't play that mine won't play either.    Netflix once told me the studios increase their security on the DVDs and they think thats what causes so many movies to become unwatchable.  Cleaning them makes no difference.  I've found almost all the new Disney movies I rent don't work.    I saw Hocus Pocus at the movies when it first was released and have also seen it on tv.  I think its a very cute movie and I love Bette Midler in it.

B001OQCV24|3.0|Sir or madam, if you came for intelligent, thought-provoking sci-fi, please leave right now. If you know anything about Roland Emmerich, you know that he likes his CG... and lots of it, and usually at the expense of believability and good storytelling sense, even for the far out science fiction genre where audiences expect the usual. If instead, you came to see lots of glorious CG mayhem and stuff getting destroyed in spectacular fashion, you are in for a good time. 2012 is unabashedly dumb sci-fi and elevates the art of apocalyptic destruction to new heights. His over-the-top CG-driven films like [[ASIN:B000WQWPKA Independence Day]], [[ASIN:B000VDDWE2 The Day After Tomorrow]], [[ASIN:B00164EAC8 Godzilla]] have grossed hundreds of millions of dollars around the world, so why change a winning, if uninspired, formula, right? After the abysmal [[ASIN:B0017U7PT6 10,000 B.C.]], Emmerich went back to doing what he does best: blowing famous places up. This time, he blows up the entire world. A master of subtlety he is not.<br /><br />The story takes too long to ramp up, and for the first 35 minutes, I was waiting for the destruction to begin. Never mind the paper-thin premise of the Mayan prophecy. It's only mentioned in passing. We don't get any explanation of that besides a 60-second Flash animation made by Charlie Frost (Woody Harrelson), a survivalist, conspiracy nut and amateur radio personality. I didn't care about the predictable and cliche exposition about the discovery by scientists of Earth's impending doom and preposterous scientific explanation that follows. We've seen this already in Day After Tomorrow, [[ASIN:B0000AKCKM The Core]], or [[ASIN:B002DMJLTE Deep Impact]], and countless other disaster movies. The idea of solar flares heating up the Earth and dire predictions of destruction are similar to [[ASIN:B001GCUNZI Knowing]]. You can sleep through the first 1/4 of the movie and not miss anything. It's all background exposition about characters we don't care about, including Jackson Curtis (John Cusack), a writer who works part-time as a chauffeur to a rich Russian businessman, Curtis's estranged wife and 2 kids, or her new plastic surgeon boyfriend, and other dysfunctional relationships between father and son, etc. Everyone is pretty much a throw-away character with throw-away performances by a seemingly laryngitis-afflicted Danny Glover as the unconvincing President, Thandie Newton as his daughter, etc, but you didn't come for the human drama.<br /><br />In 2012, Emmerich is up to his old tired tricks again. Jackson Curtis is rapper [[ASIN:B000QUCPUC 50 Cent]]'s name backwards. In 10,000 BC, the protagonist is named D'Leh, which is \\"Held\\" backwards, German for \\"hero\\". He likes to re-use character stereotypes. We get a nutty disposable character, Charlie (a waste of Woody Harrelson's talents), who is the same kind of character as the homeless guy from Day After Tomorrow. We also have the same tireless scientist trying to convince world leaders. We get a dog running to its owner and leaping to safety at the last possible moment just like in Independence Day. One of the kids is named Noah, a corny reference to the later plot element. Lastly, we get a heavy-handed, trite, and preachy speech at the end about humanity and compassion like in Independence Day. It's all very kid-friendly PG-13 stuff and it's OK that the rest of the humanity gets completely annihilated as long as the main characters escape impossible odds by the skin of their teeth, right?<br /><br />The story is safe, very average, and wholly predictable, but that's what makes it profitable. If you're going to see this, you are probably in it for the CG anyway and not for the quantum leaps of logic required to follow the story, and that's where I can find no fault. The CG is extravagant and you've never seen terrestrial destruction this fantastical before! With top-notch cinematography and set designs, 2012 really sets the bar very high for future apocalypticfilms to come and takes us to new levels of ridiculosity. Entire continents get ripped up, whole cities go down in flames, an aircraft carrier demolishes the White House!

B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle's album arrived today and I have to say that the sheer beauty of it brought me to tears. If you thought that little tidbit we got from Britains Got Talent was fabulous, you ain't heard nothin' yet folks. Incredible, absolutely incredible. EVERYONE needs to buy it - it's a gift to the world.
0756656230|4.0|Overall, the book was great. It has a few minor inaccuracies, but they're negligible. This \\"book\\" is actually two books in one slipcover. One documents the Lego Group over the years - from the time that the founder was making wooden toys at the turn of the century to the more recent NXT programmable bricks, etc. The pics are striking, and the information given is interesting. It's by no means an 'academic' book, nor is it a thorough history of the company. It's more of a visual tour. It's fun to flip through the pages and review the models that I had as a kid that have since been long-lost. The minifig book is great too.
B000002U82|5.0|The album Dark Side Of The Moon, by Pink Floyd is truthfully a foaming filling to the deep and dark crevasses of the human mind. Mentally healing is another way I would put it, intricately made as a whole to fit as if it were a jigsaw puzzle. Not only a mentally healing experience, a mentally stimulating experience. It challenges your right and left side of the brain, the cool exotic sounds are modified and are made trance like to keep you in an everlasting upbeat, good, relaxed mood. If you feel like a real treat you need a prescription of track number four titled Great Gig In The Sky, socks it to you hard. This album should be founded by the government to place on every persons door step with a copy of Wizard Of Oz and a little wacky tabacky, maybe we can get some comic relief instead of the ever so serious world wide attitude people carry with them every day. Take a seat and let this album cure you.
B002PEP4SC|3.0|I foumd this book to be a bit amateurish.  It lacked the plot detail that most good detective books have.  More intrigue with a fuller plot and story line would have made me happier.
0385532458|2.0|Although my husband and I have enjoyed Mr. Grisham's books in the past in audio/CD format, we were quite disappointed w/this collection.  Perhaps we are just not \\"short story\\" kind of people.  There was no \\"bonding\\" w/the characters and although Mr. Grisham is a very talented author, we much prefer Michael Beck as narrator rather than Mr. Grisham.  The audio book was cheaply done.  No end of story or end of disc notice. Last line of story, title, first line of next story.  You would already be listening to another story before you realized the first had ended abruptly w/no intro to the next.  The tracks are long, which means listening to 5 minutes over again to find your place. The stories are not separated on discs, they just run from one to another, so there is no guide to find \\"Story #3\\" for example.  You just have to skip around til you hear a title in between sentences.  We found most of the stories grim with little resolution at the end. Frankly, it seemed like a group of odds and ends that were cheaply thrown together.
B002HWRYJE|3.0|I guess the best way to put it is that Star Trek was neither as bad as I had feared or as good as I had hoped.  Below are a list of my plusses and minuses and a few notes:    Plus Side:    Visuals - the Enterprise looked amazing.  Casting - Zachary Quinto was very good as Spock and most of the rest of the cast did a great job with two major exceptions.   Spock - Leonard Nimoy, as alway, was awesome  Energy - it definitely had a fast, high energy pace sure to appeal to new fans as well as the current fan base.    Minus Side:    Logic - I'm sorry but there were huge gaps of logic at certain times.  The interior of the Enterprise had gigantic chambers, dozens of feet high with huge water pipes and endless random conduits.  It looked ridiculous and just made no sense.  And again, what POSSIBLE reason was there for Spock to maroon Kirk on a planet?  Park him in the brig and let him rot, but marooning someone on a hostile ice planet?  Where, by the way, he happened to meet not only future Spock but Montgomery Scott as well?  I'm as much about forgiving gaping plot holes and logic issues as much as the next guy in the interest of a good story, but they could have done MUCH, MUCH better.  Casting - Eric Bana (sp?) as Nero was horrible.  Of course his dialog was horrible as well, but if you can name me a lamer bad guy in ANY movie, the popcorn is on me.  And Chris Pine tried REALLY hard, but he sounded like a whiny teenager - oh wait, he was...  He's just not Kirk.  I'll give him a pass, though, to the next movie...    So what's my review?  I guess I'm giving the New Star Trek franchise a pass on this one and waiting to see if they do better next time out.
B000SQJ2JG|4.0|WARNING: this, actually, is Coverdale's Band without the overcasting Blackmore's shadow.<br />Now, having said that, David is in blues-rock command and Hughes in full funky form. Sioux City guitar Bolin changes the direction of this \\"deep purple\\" into a more jazzy-rock mood. Superb vocals all around. Overwhelming energy and variety comes out of this effort by a band, specially Lord and Paice, that found themself facing a forking path. A great example of mid-seventies sound.<br />And for Purple sake..how well this album has aged!
0142410705|4.0|I don't think I've ever laughed this much while reading a book.  I decided to read this book after stumbling across the author's youtube channel \\"vlogbothers\\" and finding the witty banter between him and his brother wildly entertaining, so I started this book with high expectations.  The book did not disappoint.      The book is about an ex-prodigy who has been dumped by 19 girlfriends of the same name, \\"Katherine.\\"  When the most recent Katherine breaks his heart, his best friend Hassin drags him on a road trip to heal is broken heart.     This is one of the best books I've read in a while and it certainly brightens up the increasingly vampire-ridden section of teen fiction.  I great read!
B002UHSDUK|3.0|Dave said it himself, this was part of their contract when they signed it long ago. This isn't a release they really wanted to do, nor the compilation they would put out were they to put one together themselves. If you're a hardcore Foo fan you may want to pass (although the vinyl is tempting), you've heard it all before. Wheels & Word Forward are ok additions to the Foo library, but most likely something you'd find buried toward the end of a full LP. But they are just thrown in there to give folks a reason to buy it. Save yourself the $ and pick up the MP3's from Amazon if you want them. If you know a fan that likes them but doesn't own it all, by all means pick it up as it's a nice collection of their more mainstream hits.
B001DHXT1G|4.0|With regard to the movie itself, I thought it was an excellent movie. I even repurchased it on Blue Ray after already owning it on DVD.     My review is specific to the blue ray disc product being sold, not the movie. Unfortunately the digital copy that came with The Incredible Hulk on Blue Ray was expired before the movie was even purchased.
B0018W2L38|4.0|If you've been losing sleep wondering how Verdi's \\"Otello\\" would sound performed in Russian, here's your chance to check it out. I've heard a fair amount of standard rep in Russian, and to my ears \\"Otello\\" is not as effective as, for example, \\"The Barber of Seville.\\" Maybe it's the comedy/tragedy thing at work. However, if the language is not a problem I would imagine any Verdi fan would enjoy this recording on its own merits.  As you can judge by the cover billing, Ponto anticipates that the principal attraction here will be Vishnevskaya's Desdemona. Indeed, the program notes characterize the release of this 1969 Moscow Conservatory live performance in Russian as an 80th birthday tribute to the soprano and the included bonus tracks feature her in excerpts from Act 3 of a 1964 Covent Garden \\"Aida\\". The \\"Otello,\\" however, has far more than the admirable Vishnevskaya going for it.  The young Atlantov's powerhouse singing as Otello features the right kind of voice for the title role, it is easy to see why he a few years later he was in demand everywhere for the part. To my ears, he sounds a bit like Ramon Vinay but less beefy. The Iago, Oleg Klyonov, is otherwise unknown to me but he delivers a worthy villain with plenty of voice--not as distinctive as Lisitsian, but a pleasure nonetheless. Vishnevskaya's Desdemona is not as Italianate as one can hear on her Preiser LV recital (a must-hear for her fans and an eye-opener for those who know her only in Russian repertoire); the basic timbre here leans more toward the hooded tone that introduced her to many Western ears in the premiere recording of Britten's \\"War Requiem\\" in 1963. She does some lovely things, especially in her Willow Song/Ave Maria in the last act, and it is interesting to hear the way the voice shifts when she switches briefly to the Latin of \\"Ave Maria.\\" I don't think the part is necessarily a great fit for her; she sure doesn't sound like your wimpy blond stereotype. A further plus is the excellent Cassio by comprimario Alexei Maslennikov, who you may remember as the Simpleton in Karajan's studio \\"Boris\\".   Svetlanov starts out somewhat underpowered but picks up steam by the end of Act 2 and does a particularly fine job with the final act. Some of the seams in the music show from time to time (a clunky \\"Fuoco di gioia\\" chorus, a sing-songy beginning to \\"Era la notte\\"), but we have to make allowances for live performance. It's not specified, but I'm guessing this was a concert broadcast or perhaps a radio broadcast; the audience is very well-behaved, with only a bit of coughing and applause held until the ends of acts. Sound is very decent mono, the included booklet features extensive tracking with headings in Italian but no libretto in Russian or Italian. There is also a detailed biographical note on Vishnevskaya's career.    The Covent Garden \\"Aida\\" bonus tracks give us about 19 minutes of Act 3, from the beginning through the Aida/Amonasro duet. The sound is frustratingly bad, lots of stage clunkings and what sounds like an onstage river gurgling loudly. What you can hear of Vishnevskaya and Peter Glossop's Amonasro is pretty good, but they sound like they're in the proverbial phone booth. If you want to hear a better representation of Vishnevskaya's Aida,check out Ponto's release of \\"Aida\\" (see my review).     Casual opera fans need to have a reference recording of \\"Otello\\" in the original language, but for Verdians interested in a different slant on the familiar, this one has a lot to offer. Not your number one choice but a very worthy supplemental recording.
B002X20W2E|4.0|I was a little sad that Amazon was selling the explicit version of Rated R for the promotional price until I did a search under Rihanna and found the regular version (without the angry, foul language) for the same price.  If you too dislike vulgar language in your music, don't just abandon the cd.  It is actually excellent in the non-explicit version.

B001KVZ6FW|4.0|\\"Up\\" is an oddly incongruous film from Pixar in that it has primarily adult themes but a relatively simple visual style and an over-the-top adventure plot. Carl Frederickson (Ed Asner) is an elderly widower who had always dreamed with his wife Ellie of far-flung adventures. In particular, they wanted to visit \\"Paradise Falls\\" in South America, where their childhood hero, an adventurer named Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer), made his name. Before he is forced into a retirement home, Carl takes one last shot at his dream. He attaches about 20,000 helium balloons to his house, hoists some sails, and sets the house aloft. But Carl has an unintended guest: an boy named Russell (Jordan Nagai), overeager to get his Wilderness Explorer \\"Helping the Elderly Badge\\", is on the porch.<br /><br />Carl and Russell have only a few days to deposit the house atop Paradise Falls before the balloons deflate. The boy's idealism and enthusiasm clash with Carl's sense of urgency. Russell befriends a giant bird and a talking dog named Dug (Bob Petersen) but cannot understand Carl's increasing desperation. Carl is an old man who feels the pressure of very limited time to fulfill his life's dream, and at first he doesn't' have much patience with Russell's cheerful but easily distracted temperament. Now, this is entertaining to watch, but how much would a child understand or care about Carl's problem? \\"Up\\" does not limit its appeal to children, as \\"Finding Nemo\\" and \\"Cars\\" did, but I wonder if it has not done the opposite and taken on themes that are irrelevant to children.<br /><br />I hope this will not spoil the movie for anyone, but I feel compelled to mention the strangest thing about this film: There is a man living in the jungle who is right out of Joseph Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness\\". He is worshiped and served by a group of violent primitives (in this case domesticated dogs), and he collects the heads (in this case helmets) of those who have dared trespass his little fiefdom, whom we assume he has killed. He's an intelligent, accomplished man whose mind has gone `round the bend. He's Kurtz. Should I be surprised to see a Kurtz character in a \\"family film\\"? There is nothing graphic about \\"Up\\", and I don't think this guy is any scarier than a typical Pixar villain. \\"Up\\" is an entertaining film, though it lacks the visual interest and innovation that I've come to expect from Pixar (it was intended to be shown in 3D). I just wonder what children will make of it.s killed. He's an intelligent, accomplished man whose mind has gone `round the bend. He's Kurtz.

B001C4CI8U|3.0|Starting to smell a little of the viral marketing hype machine here.    This is a decent television show, better than average for a network, somewhat below average compared to HBO/Showtime shows. The mass audience whose sole experience with Sci Fi is X-Files or BSG will like it. Needs more meat to keep a serious SciFi fan's attention.    The acting is fine, the actors do a good job of making the characters fairly interesting, the writing is often banal and cliched unfortunately. Moves the obligatory government/big corporation conspiracy meta-plot along well and coherently unlike the X-Files, though the meta plot here is not nearly as interesting or intelligent as in the X-Files.    Massive suspension of disbelief issues abound, the explanations for why the plots unfold as they do are usually dumb and unconvincing. We are led to believe that an extremist group is preparing for a war between alternate universes, but not enough convincing detail is given as to why the group acts as it does to allow immersion. Every episode offers really stretched explanations as to why the sect is acting as it is, it's all just backdrop for the monsters and mayhem anyway, so this is forgiveable.    Decent television, yes, the masterpiece some reviews here would lead one to believe? Sorry, no.
0316044695|5.0|This is by far one of the best of the books I have read on the War on Terror. And I have read close to 100 so far. We all neeed to thank him and the families of the men who paid the ultimate price that day in Afganistan. A action packed story that will keep you reading from strt to finish without putting it down once----just as I did!
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|The book follows his previous work in that it provides interesting factual information weaved into the story. The result is a book that is a page turner and you are rewarded with a few bits of knowledge that you get to keep. The only criticism I would have is that the story ended about 100 pages before the book did. The last part could have been left out of the story entirely or included in an epilogue for those who would be interested in a few more interesting factoids and philosophical ideas. So far Dan has used the his knowledge and imagination about the masons and the templars to write two wonderful books, I look forward to any future books... maybe involving the Sumarian's? or other ancient civilization as a natural progression to his writing style and interest.
B0015DROBO|1.0|I listened to this book by downloading it from [...].  It turns out that the only way I was able to get through it was because I was only listening to it, which I imagine is slightly less aggravating.  I am utterly awestruck at the positive and glowing reviews of this novel.  I have multiple issues with the book, but will confine them to a handful here.<br /><br />First, the book doesn't really seem to know what it want to be.  It is a murder mystery, commentary on life of women in Sweden, romance, a character piece?  One never knows because it tries to handle all of these areas, and does so poorly.<br /><br />Second, the author goes into excruciating detail about meaningless nonsense that has nothing to do with the story (the type of sandwiches eaten or computer purchased) but glosses over the relevant and interesting aspects of the book.  In one instance, a computer is hacked without an adequate and believable description of the methodology.  The author also fails to appreciate the capacity of the internet, internet connections and firewalls, which presents a large loophole in the hacking aspect of the book. It seems that the author did very little research on this topic.<br /><br />Third, there is an exhaustive backstory developed of the Vanger family which is unnecessary, but takes up ALOT of space in the book.<br /><br />Lastly, the book is slow-moving, monotonous and unbelievable.  The characters lacked any depth for me, and all seemed pretty one-dimensional.  The sole saving grace I found was the descriptions of the thought-processes of Lisbeth.  Though i enjoyed these areas, which were few and far between, I wouldn't wish this book on anyone.  Pick something from Amazon at random and you will get a better story.
B001FB55I0|1.0|Please, James Cameron, buy back the rights to Terminator (I hear Halcyon could use the money) and save us all from a continuing slew of mediocre \\"sequels\\" and a poorly executed, woefully under-budgeted, and ultimately canceled TV show (T3, this film, and TSCC).    The only good that's come out of the never ending milking of the franchise is the intriguing protector Terminator character of Cameron Phillips (portrayed by Summer Glau) from TV's The Sarah Connor Chronicles, who is smitten with one baffled and equally smitten John Connor (star-crossed lovers, anyone?).  That's it... end of story.      Don't get me started on Christian Bale's one-note embodiment of an older John Connor, or the cringe-worthy effort by Nick Stahl in T3, or the equally flat performance of Kristanna Loken as the TX, or the bland Marcus Wright hybrid played by Sam \\"I look bored with my job\\" Worthington in Salvation.    If James Cameron or someone of equal vision and skill could make an entertaining, intelligent, and timely sci-fi/action/adventure epic around a 20-something Cameron (again played by Summer) and a 20-something John Connor and make it an official T3 (ignoring Rise of the Machines and Salvation completely) I'd give this theoretical sequel a chance.  Heck, I'd even love Arnold Schwarzenegger and Robert Patrick and even Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn to come back for more fun (you have time travel and alternate time lines, JD being pushed back even farther into the future, and a non-Cyberdyne Skynet-like entity evolving differently this time around, at your disposal, so anything is possible... even if the original cast is showing its age-- like us all).  Get the band back together!            Until then... stick with watching the classics The Terminator and T2: The Extended Cut.  Don't waste your time or your money on this flick.
B000JIHP88|5.0|Fantastic mobile! I purchased this when my daughter was 6 weeks old and she absolutely loves it. My husband had to build a mount for it to hang on the wall since she sleeps in a pack-n-play and it wouldn't attach to the model we have. Anyway, she will watch the mobile for nearly half an hour just kicking her legs and talking to the turning animals. It keeps her very entertained. I love it!
B0026P3G12|5.0|True talent and inspiration comes from within, and Susan has proven that she has the grace to withstand all of the garbage that was thrown at her and just sing. She proves that the glitz, tons of makeup, over dubbing and all of that other junk that goes into being a \\"star\\" is fake. Let other mediocre singers be stars. Leave Susan alone, let her sing and we will all be the better for it.

B002NWRMVS|5.0|Ok, so Norah Jones is a constantly growing artist and this growth has taken her into a great new direction! The music, the phrasing, the words, and the driving beats in songs like Chasing Pirates and Young Blood just keep Rocking! There is not a weak song on the album and after many many listens I have ranked this album up there with \\"Come away with Me.\\" On The Fall Norah's instrument of choice, (and mine) is her beautiful voice that rises above the retro guitars and banging drums to cut through the distorted piano and guitar like a knife seeking the heart. Gone are the quietly lush orchestrations of her earlier albums and they have been replaced with guitar, bass, drums, and a Wurlitzer keyboard, that will easily be duplicated in concert in smaller venues. Yea, I can't wait! I find it a little dissapointing that some people just don't get it but that is their problem. I get it and I love it.
B002FOQXZK|2.0|A friend of mine has been going nuts about this cd for a long time now so I had to pick it up and check it out.  I had heard Day N Nite and Pursuit of Happiness before grabbing the cd.  I gotta say, it is different than most mainstream stuff out there now but when you get down to what the album is actually about...its just about being a stoner and the wierd dreams and nightmares stoners have.      Pursuit of Happiness is a great song, the best one on the album imo.  The beats all kind of blend together, which makes sense since its a concept album and needs to follow a certain theme.      I'm not a stoner but I can see how one could get a lot out of this album.  Cudi is alright at rapping, he doesn't change his cadence or schemes up too much and his lyrics range from very simple to slightly complex.  He isn't the greatest MC ever but is a solid one.    The album is a hit or miss album.  I like a few of the tracks and have been playing Pursuit of Happiness daily since it is awesome. Most people are either going to love this album or not get a lot out of it.  If you like slow beats and lots of dream/stoner raps than you will love this.  If your not a stoner and not into concept albums than stay away.    I'm not a stoner but do enjoy the occasional concept album so this gets 2 1/2 stars.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|The only thing wrong with this series was it's short life. In a way it's quality was it's downfall. It was so expensive to produce that it got too expensive for HBO. The series had no flaws. Writing, acting, sets, costumes and cinematography were all top rate. The characters are a combination of real and composite but it's probably the most historically accurate portrayal of everyday Roman life ever made. And how could you not love the character of Titus Pullo.    Favorite scenes....Servilia's curse of Atia (any more would be a spoiler)                   ....Pullo offering a God a sacrifice to open a lock for him      (paraphrase) 'a nice lamb if I can get one at a good price if not then six pigeons'.

B000DZ6VAK|4.0|The review title says it all. For my taste, few pianists are as attuned to Mozart as Uchida. I do not hear whatever it is that her detractors call \\"fussy.\\" To me she is thoughtful, sensitive, nuanced, and joyful, expressing the full range of Mozart's delights. If her accompaniment were her equal, this would be THE set of choice. Tate's a bit too conventional and workmanlike for my tastes, however, and therefore this complete cycle takes a back seat to Schiff [[ASIN:B000025706 Mozart: Piano Concertos [Australia]]] and Buchbinder [[ASIN:B0002O37X6 Mozart: The Piano Concertos [Box Set]]] as far as I'm concerned.

0882709194|1.0|When I first picked up this book during a giveaway, I thought: \\"Wow, that's really nice. Darwin's 150th anniversary is being celebrated and his revolutionary work deservedly recognized!\\". Not so fast. Later on that day I found out the real story about this book. It's basically a shameful act from a clueless opportunist who is just trying to promote himself using Darwin's name. If you don't believe in evolution, there's nothing wrong with that. Evolution does not exclude the existence of God. It has nothing to do with that. So, don't try to put your unfounded beliefs at the same level of a scientific theory. In the past there were many examples of scientific theories (Earth orbiting around the Sun, drift of tectonic plates, etc) which took a long time to be accepted, and now are regarded simply as facts. Today, the same process is going on with Evolution, even though it could easily be thought as a fact already. Unfortunately, it seems that only time will show the truth and how fool we all were once again. As Einstein once said: \\"Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds\\". He totally nailed this one.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle has a beautiful gift.  I am glad she got it together enough to make this album.  Her voice is shown off beautifully in it.  It is a natural talent.  How amazing that she was discovered and is able to be show cased like this.
B00260HH3K|1.0|I've been a diehard fan of the series since I first saw it on Cartoon Network all those years ago. When I heard about a live action movie coming soon (I first heard in 2002 or 2003 thru a magazine published by Beckett), I was estatic. I was expecting a huge cast with big name stars to play the characters of the most popular and succesful anime of all time.<br /><br />This movie shouldn't even carry the rights to Dragonball. It was nothing like it. Let's start off with characters.<br /><br />Goku - He likes girls? Wait, what? In the anime, he didn't even know what the difference between a boy and a girl was. He married Chi-Chi without even knowing what marriage was, and school? What school? Where's the always hungry, gullible, naive Goku we've grown to love? The actor who plays him isn't the first I would pick to play Goku anyway. Ugh.<br /><br />Krillin - What the hell? Where is Goku's best friend Krillin? How do you do a dragonball adaptation without him?<br /><br />Bulma - One of the finer points of the movie. The actress who plays Bulma is gorgeous, just like Bulma should be. Still, they did away with the blue hair, and gave her a blue streak?<br /><br />Master Roshi - Reminds me NOTHING of the Master Roshi from the anime. I mean absolutuly nothing like the original Roshi.<br /><br />Other small annoying little changes... Where are the talking animals? Roshi's turtle, Oolong, Puar? How about Yamcha being deathly afraid of girls, especially when he met Bulma. The Kamehameha was WEAK, it looked horrible. Goku only wears the classic Orange Gi, for about 5 minutes on-screen. Y'know the movie is going to be bad, when the best fight scene in the movie is near the beginning with high school kids. Wow.<br /><br />So, if you're looking for a movie true to the anime. This is not it. You will be extremely dissapointed. Now, in an attempt at pretending I know nothing of Dragonball, and was watching and hearing everything for the first time...It's still horrible. You'll just have less reason to dislike it, than the fans.

This is a solid book with great information written by industry leaders. The authors don't bring anything new or ground breaking to light in Execution. With that said, new isn't always better. Old tested ways can be better than a new theoretical idea. It's good to get a reminder of solid time test concepts.
B001KVZ6G6|1.0|\\"Up\\" is a great movie, I highly recommend it, but wait for a better DVD Treatment.    Allow lots and lots and lots of time to get the movie started.      The DVD doesn't even play on some players, thanks to some DRM (Digital Restriction Mess-Up).    UOPs (User Operation Prohibition) are enabled on this DVD meaning that you cannot skip over many parts of the DVD and are FORCED to watch things you have no interest in.      While it is easy to purchse a DVD player that overrides UOPs, there are no Blu-ray players that do this YET.      Avoid this presentation of the movie.  When a later one is released that is not hostile to the viewer, buy it only then.

B0012QE4Q2|5.0|\\"The Other Bolyn Girl\\" was released to theatres on February 29th, 2008 and became an immediate hit grossing over $75,000,000 at the boxoffice. These were huge numbers considering the movie only cost $35,000,000 to produce. Perhaps it was the fact that television viewers, at the time, were enthralled by Showtime's \\"The Tudors\\" and movie-going audiences were inclined to watch a historical piece on King Henry VIII that made this a hit, but \\"The Other Bolyn Girl\\" could never have failed; it had all the ingredients of a hit film: stunning photography, a wonderful story that was known to its audience, and enthralling performances by its three leads. \\"The Other Bolyn Girl\\" tells the story of 16th-century aristocrats Mary and Anne, sisters, fighting over King Henry VIII. Mary would ultimately be only Henry's mistress(one of many) and Anne would become his second wife(also one of many). Both sisters were trying to better themselves and their family by getting involved with the Monarch, but both failed to realize the King was only in love with two things; his country and his unfulfilled sexual apetite. The sisters are played by Natalie Portman (Anne) and Scarlett Johansson (Mary), but it is Eric Bana, who plays King Henry, that is mesmerizing. He displays many emotions as the King of England; everything from raw sexuality (Eric is breathtaking to look at with his beard) to hatred, passion, love, desire, and vengefulness. The production values of this historical drama are first-rate with beautiful costumes and cinematography. The DVD comes with deleted and extended scenes, featurettes on the film and its historcial figures, and more. WNBC says of the film that it's , \\"a wonderful, dramatic and powerful saga of the dangers of absolute power. The cast is impeccable\\". If you enjoy \\"The Other Bolyn Girl\\" you will love TV's \\"The Tudors\\". That series' first two seasons are available on DVD.
