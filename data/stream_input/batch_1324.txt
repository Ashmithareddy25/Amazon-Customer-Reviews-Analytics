B000002AHC|2.0|While I find the quality of the song writing and the performances of the songs in \\"The Notorious Byrd Brothers\\" to be of the same high caliber as The Byrds' previous records, the approach to producing this album was undermined by the attempt to just mindlessly follow along with the then-standard \\"psychedelic\\" fashion.  There is way too much reverb applied to the tunes. Just as annoying, the vocals were grossly sped up (in homage to The Beatles?) What you wind up listening to are sounds more in sync with Alvin and The Chipmunks, on acid yet!  What's ironic is that two of the extra cuts included on this late '90s release, \\"Bound To Fall\\" and \\"Triad\\" are not given such ridiculous treatment, and they come off all the more worth listening to (for my ears). Too bad that \\"Bound To Fall\\" is just an instrumental track.  Though there's nothing I can do about the reverb, I plan to adjust my copy of the album (speed-wise) with the help of a software program I have. Hopefully, I can do it competently enough so that the album is not as annoying to listen to as it is.

0439023521|1.0|I wanted to love this book.  It's a wonderful thing to find a long work that earns your respect and keeps you mesmerized for hundreds of pages.  Like Robert Graves with I,Claudius or Patrick O'Brien with his Aubrey/Maturin series.  But The Hunger Games is not even close to being in that league.  It's not even a great book for bright pre-teens.  The author gets off to a fine start.  Great pace; perceptive and balanced character development, an imaginative description of a strange post-apocalyptic world. Too bad that fine beginning devolves into unbearable dreck after the first 30 pages.  And stays there to the bitter end.  I assert that in the real world, post-apocalyptic or otherwise, men and women span the spectra of heroism, evil, intelligence, avarice, initiative, boorishness, wit, backbone, and everything else human in roughly equal measure.  But in the author's self-indulgent world almost all the men have almost all the flaws, and almost all the women have almost all the admirable traits.  Jeez, give it a rest already.  This one-note samba is not the tune to which great books dance.  Furthermore, the author is irritatingly lazy and unimaginative.  When she needs some Deus ex Machina she just plops it in, with little backstory and almost no credibility.  The heroine needs some medicine? Plop! It arrives via a little silver parachute, paid by a of a destitute populace who can barely feed themselves.  This sort of abuse of our willingness to suspend disbelieve happens over and over again.  This book is jejune, uninspired, and banal.  Too bad, the author obviously has talent --- someone should teach her a little judgement and an eye for reality.

B004EPZ02A|4.0|I have read a few 'reviews' of people giving this movie 1 star because they saw it in the theater and didn't get answers. We all know DVD/BluRay releases typically give an Unrated Version or at least deleted scenes! And furthermore if you watched all three films closely they left it open for a 4th movie to answer other questions like what happened to the mother? What happened in 1992 (look closely at the box of video tapes in the first movie)? Etc..  Basically the movie itself had the typical startle moments whether you expect them or not and a final scene that made everyone I know cringe! So STOP giving this DVD/BluRay release a poor grade because it has not even been released yet! You are just showing your personal ignorance!

B003UESJH4|5.0|What can I say? -- ironic seeing how the movie is about \\"speech\\". It was WONDERFUL. I rented it when I watched it the first time, but after I saw the movie, I KNEW I HAD TO HAVE A COPY. It's a movie I see myself watching over & over, moreso since it's based on a true life story -- my favorite type of movie. It was WELL acted by Colin Firth.  Watching him, I almost thought I was REALLY watching the real king, and I felt SO SORRY for him. It's such a compelling heart-wrenching story.  But I love it EVEN MORE BECAUSE IT HAD A HAPPY ENDING!!!  Again, my favorite TYPE of movie -- I HATE downers.  This movie allows you to be entertained WHILE also learning some history!  (:
B006TQUNX8|5.0|Dorian Gray is absurdly good-looking. Utterly infatuated, Basil Hallward captures Dorian's youthful beauty in a portrait.<br /><br />While posing for this portrait, Dorian meets Basil's friend, Lord Henry Wotton, who charmingly preaches hedonism. Lord Henry's efforts to corrupt Dorian work quickly. Convinced that youth and beauty are the only things worth having in life, Dorian looks upon his finished portrait with cruel jealousy. His image will never grow old, but he will.<br /><br />One wish sends the plot of the novel into action: Dorian wishes the portrait would age, while he stays youthful.<br /><br />Enter a lover whose heart Dorian breaks. Her despair coerces her to suicide. With her death on his conscience, he notices an evil glint in the eye of his portrait. Over the years, Basil's painting begins to age. Dorian sabotages reputations and even commits murder, all the while looking as young and beautiful as he did on the day his portrait was painted. However, the portrait-a grotesque reminder of his double life-documents every immoral act.<br /><br />Focusing on duplicity and aestheticism, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a captivating and cinematic tale. Oscar Wilde's knack for dialogue is what made him a famous playwright and parts of Dorian Gray are rich with clever play-like exchanges.<br /><br />Lord Henry's wit is exceptionally tantalizing. But he doesn't seem to take himself too seriously, whereas Dorian adopts everything Lord Henry preaches with the conviction of a Southern Baptist. He's basically just a dumb pretty person that everyone coddles despite the fact that he's a terrible human being.<br /><br />**Side note**<br />The Picture of Dorian Gray is Oscar Wilde's only novel. The book was scandalous when it was released in 1891 because of clear homoerotic undertones. Dorian's lovers are both men and women. Though not overtly sexual, Basil's infatuation with Dorian is questionable. Wilde himself had an affair with Robert Ross.

B0061JPYX2|4.0|Listening to this recording is such a bitter-sweet experience. Amy Winehouse had the voice and the musical talent to build a career for the ages. Unlike so many pop divas, her genius was built to last. She could have become an Ella Fitzgerald-like figure -- a towering icon. If only. If only the self-destructive part of her psyche could have been brought under control. You read the liner notes of this CD and you see the photos of the intrinsically lovely but deeply damaged person -- you see the signs of personal destructiveness on her body. And you sigh for what might have been.<br /><br />I don't think this was Amy's best work. I didn't love all the arrangements. But it shouldn't have mattered. She should have had many years to do better and better, to nurture and grow that talent, to fulfill that huge potential.<br /><br />What I do like about the choice of music is the way she was consciously placing herself as a link in the chain of a grand musical tradition. There are songs here from the 1930s, from the 1950s and 1960s -- and brand new compositions. There are really lovely moments. Even the failures are interesting. You can tell she thought about this music and engaged fully with it.<br /><br />What a terrible pity.
B003Y5H5EW|4.0|Underworld: Awakening, starring Kate Beckinsale, India Eisley, Stephen Rea, Charles Dance, Michael Ealy, Sandrine Holt and Kris Holden-Reid, finally arrives in theaters today, but is it worth the wait and will it bring a floundering franchise back to life?  Yeah, it does.<br /><br />*Mini-Spoilers Alert*<br />Humans have learned of the existence of vamps and lycans, and reacted predictably badly to the news.  Selene gets captured while she and Michael trying to escape the carnage and she awakens twelve years later in a specimen lab at a company called AntiGen and escapes, vaguely aware that someone called Specimen 2 (India Eisley) aided her.  Contacted by David (Theo James), a member of a ragtag coven of surviving vamps, she discovers the truth of her situation: Specimen 2 is her biological daughter and they were being experimented upon for reasons both obvious and not so much. Dr. Jacob Lane (Stephen Rea), head of AntiGen, who claims to be working on a vaccine for the lycan/vampire strains, has a different endgame in mind.  Thwarted by AntiGen's stonewalling after Selene's escape, Detective Sebastian (Michael Ealy) is also hot on her trail, having his own reasons for tracking her down.<br />*End Spoilers*<br /><br />Much like Resident Evil, this is a franchise that's starting to run on fumes and needs a new jolt.  U:A does so, but like other flicks in the genre, the fault lies more in the execution.  Humans learning about lycans and vamps is just what was needed here, but letting us see the downfall of the two groups as it happened would've made a better story than catching up after the fact.<br /><br />Cinematography and art design remain the same: oversaturated blue palettes for everything, all the time.  Plus lots of rain-washed city streets in the night, sterile lab rooms, dank & cold caverns and tunnels- all lovingly rendered in a gothic shade of blue.  Even the sunshine.<br /><br />Blood and gore are ok, but inconsistent.  Half the time everyone, including the central cast, looked like they took shooting lessons at Mook Central:  too many times a person is standing stock still yet the bullet holes keep decorating the walls and surroundings (think Pulp Fiction when the guy tried to shoot Jules and Vincent).  But it's got eviscerations, lacerations and gougings galore- it'll sate your blood lust, don't you worry.<br /><br />Dialogue gets utterly cheesy at times but it was never supposed to be Shakespeare, was it?  I'm just finding it hard to believe that J. Michael Straczynski had a hand in the script.  The cast is interesting for it's selection, but let's face it- all they're being called upon to do is snarl, growl, sneer, angst, and in some cases, die in a CGI rendering.  Nice work if you can get it.  :)  Notably absent is Scott Speedman, who has declined to reprise his role in the series (as yet), but his character gets a cameo to support the story.<br /><br />Only real question I have is the soundtrack.  None of the songs even appear until after the credits start rolling, so what's the point of having Lacuna Coil & Evanscence around if you don't use them?<br /><br />U:A is the kick start the series needed.  It's a popcorn flick with enough chops to hold down a spot in both the urban fantasy genre and the franchise itself.  Now all it needs is to lose the overpriced 3D effects and use the extra time to flesh out the story some more and everything'll be fine.essons at Mook Central:  too many times a person is standing stock still yet the bullet holes keep decorating the walls and surroundings (think Pulp Fiction when the guy tried to shoot Jules and Vincent).

B006G7YBT2|5.0|I greatly enjoyed this thriller set in San Diego among the surfing fraternity. The hero, Boone Daniels, is right in the Raymond Chandler tradition -- the outcast with unshakeable morals. And the rest of the cast is also first class. I learned a lot about the philosophy of surfing and also about the shifting ground on which San Diego is literally built, which becomes a kind of metaphor for the story.<br /><br />There was a touch of \\"Chinatown\\" in this novel as the private investigator begins with what seems like two separate investigations that gradually meld into one huge underbelly of corruption that affects the entire city. Boone seems to face moral dilemmas on virtually every page but in his flip-flops and cutoffs is a true gentleman throughout.<br /><br />Only one false note: the exquisitely fastidious torturer and contract killer that makes an appearance toward the end (NOT GIVING TOO MUCH AWAY HERE) -- a bit too much of a cliche.<br /><br />Otherwise, catch this wave of a book and ride it.
B0062P3392|2.0|This action-thriller-spy movie just goes to show, great actors don't necessarily make great movies do--good scripts do. The original had James Caan & Robert Duvall; this remake has Jason Statham & Robert De Niro sounds like it couldn't miss right? Wrong. It's all action and complicated plot points and no soul. All explosions, gunfire, and fights and none of it matters. The original had the assassins/friends turning on each other with Duvall putting Caan out of the business by wounding him severely, but not killing him. The rehab & revenge angle of that film made it worth seeing. Here we have a genuine 'buddy' film but the 2 buddies kill people for money. De Niro is also a 'family man' with a Wife & kids we never see, while Statham has a beautiful girlfriend waiting for him back home who just wants to reform her man from his wicked past thru her undying love. Dumb. Jason Statham is a genuine action star and has made some good movies (The Transporter is one), and De Niro made a similar(but MUCH better) film, \\"Ronan\\" but both tough guys 'flop' here. And Clive Owen? He's a great actor (watch him in The Croupier)--but he makes a lot of crummy movies like this one and he's too good in his good films to make 'crap' like this. Watch the original--its 10X better.

0307593312|3.0|This review recently appeared on nipponinitiative.org.    I first heard of 1Q84 by Haruki Murakami while listening one day to NPR. The person mentioning the book said something like, \\"If you want to know more about how Japanese people think, 1Q84 is a must-read.\\" So I ordered the book and began to read it, all 925 pages of it. That's right--925 pages. Other than the Bible, it is the longest book I've ever read. Even the New York Times lamented the length of 1Q84, noting \\"Mr. Murakami's determination to describe, inventory and echo just about everything that he chooses to mention.\\"    Fair enough, but the question remains: Does 1Q84 deliver with insights into the mind of Japanese people? If so, what exactly does it say about their worldview?    1Q84 is the story of two people, Aomame and Tengo, separated during childhood but reunited as young adults drawn into a world heavily under the influence of powerful \\"Little People.\\" In the world of 1Q84, Little People, who magically enter the world through the mouth of a dead goat, control weather and other natural phenomena. They manipulate both circumstances and people, expressing anger, issuing warnings, turning some into their agents--all this without the benefit of omnipotence or moral anchors. \\"We do not know if the so-called Little People are good or evil, \\" someone remarks. \\"But the important thing is that, whether they are good or evil, light or shadow, whenever they begin to exert their power, a compensatory force comes into being.\\"    If 1Q84 reveals the worldview of modern Japanese, this exchange shows how central of a role Shinto continues to play in hearts and minds throughout the land of the Rising Sun, in spite of so many now claiming to have turned away from religion toward more urban ways of thinking. Shinto, also known as \\"kami no michi\\" (the way of kami), embraces the existence of divine forces that, like \\"Little People,\\" are neither good nor evil, moral nor immoral: \\"kami are manifold; some kami are noble, while others are lowly, some are strong, whereas others are weak; again, some kami are good, while others are evil.\\"1 Once again, kami are like \\"Little People,\\" everywhere and potentially in everything, including humans.    As in the world of 1Q84, which drew in Aomame and Tengo, the world wherein kami exist is unpredictable and dangerous. It is a world wherein the rules of ethics and morality may not apply. Instead, right thinking and right action are determined by \\"somatically enacted feelings\\"2; in other words, by conforming body and attitudes to the way things are and then acting accordingly. Such a world provides no absolute moral or physical safe harbor.    In 1Q84, the lives of Aomame and Tengo illustrate fear, hopelessness, despair, and a desire to escape from reality. If Murakami's portrayal accurately illustrates the worldview of modern Japanese with all of its vestiges of Shinto, then his work also stands as a call for answers that will truly serve the deepest needs of the hearts of his dear countrymen. At the Nippon Initiative, of course, we believe the worldview of biblical Christianity offers real and meaningful solutions to the world of Shinto and 1Q84. Strangely enough, Murakami himself opens that door as the story of 1Q84 unfolds. More about this in Part 2 of this review.  PART 2: The world of 1Q84 proves to be dangerous and unpredictable, a world that lends itself to fear, hopelessness, and despair. It is no wonder that author Haruki Murakami portrays the main characters of 1Q84, Aomame and Tengo, as driven to escape the uncertainty and threat it poses to them. Early in the 925-page tome, Tengo explains how he often retreated to mathematics, a realm of \\"infinite consistency,\\" in order to \\"escape from the troublesome cage of reality.\\"  To Tengo:    The world governed by numerical expression was, for him, a legitimate and always safe hiding place. As long as he stayed in that world, he could forget or ignore the rules and burdens forced upon him bythe real world.   However, over time, Tengo discovered just as much dissatisfaction with the world of mathematics as he had experienced with the \\"burdens\\" of the real world: \\"In elementary and middle school, Tengo was utterly absorbed by the world of mathematics. Its clarity and absolute freedom enthralled him, and he also needed them to survive. Once he entered adolescence, however, he began to feel increasingly that this might not be enough. There was no problem as long as he was visiting the world of math, but when he returned to the real world (as return he must), he found himself in the same miserable cage. Nothing had improved. Rather, his shackles felt even heavier. So then, what good was mathematics? Wasn't it just a temporary means of escape that made his real-life situation even worse?\\"    In these lines, Murakami puts his finger on a dilemma faced by so many Japanese people. On one hand, there appears to be such an attraction in the hearts and minds of Japanese people to order and predictability. These are the things that preserve harmony in a world that otherwise has so much potential for chaos. On the other hand, the chaos inherent in the Shinto and Buddhist worldviews stubbornly persists without any real solution. It is like a pair of shackles on the soul that, as Tengo indicated, \\"feel even heavier\\" when he returned to the real world.   So how does Tengo deal with this dilemma? He escapes to the world of story:\\"The role of a story was, in the broadest terms, to transpose a single problem into another form. Depending on the nature and direction of the problem, a solution could be suggested in the narrative. Tengo would return to the real world with that suggestion in hand. It was like a piece of paper bearing the indecipherable text of a magic spell. At times it lacked coherence and served no immediate practical purpose. But it would contain a possibility. Somehow he might be able to decipher the spell. That possibility would gently warm his heart from within.\\"   In other words, Tengo decided that if there were going to be any solution to the shackles on his soul, it would have to be found in some alternative way of understanding how and why the world works the way that it does, along with what place he personally has in it.    In Part 3 of this review, we will look at one of the alternatives--the worldview of biblical Christianity in contrast with the worldview of 1Q84. We will see once again that Murakami's novel opens the door to the possibility of a biblical worldview, coming closer to laying a foundation for its narrative than the author may have ever imagined.  PART 3: The storyline of 1Q84 centers on the main characters being drawn into another realm of existence. It is a realm dominated by \\"Little People\\", kami-like beings full of mystery and mischief, and therefore unpredictable and dangerous. As it turns out, life in 1Q84, for Aomame and Tengo (and several other characters besides) proves to be utterly unattractive, offering no relief for the shackles Tengo felt on his soul, as described in Part 2 of this review.   Author Haruki Murakami's storyline taps into a view of reality similar to one found in biblical Christianity. Like 1Q84, the Christian worldview also asserts the existence of a realm that intersects and interacts with the ordinary realm in which we live. Only instead of being ruled by \\"Little People\\", the parallel realm of the Christian worldview is under the rule of the living, Creator God, an eternal King over all. In the New Testament book of Matthew, Jesus refers to this realm as \\"the kingdom of the heavens.\\"    One of the many differences between the operation of the realm of 1Q84 and the kingdom of the heavens is this: in 1Q84, Aomame and Tengo leave this realm to enter into the realm of the Little People; in the biblical account, the kingdom of the heavens penetrates into this realm. In other words, no one leaves this world to encounter the kingdom of the heavens; the kingdom of the heavens comes to us.    Another difference involves the matters of danger and despair. Unlike the world of 1Q84, encounters with the kingdom of the heavens are encounters with blessing, divine reversals of misfortune, and life to the full. All of these, by the way, are promised by Jesus Christ to those who interact with the kingdom of the heavens through him by faith in hm. This is not to say that the biblical worldview offers \\"escape\\" from the dangers and daily grind of the physical world. Instead it offers the other-world power and resources of the kingdom of the heavens to cope with life in this realm. It also offers meaning to explain the existence of evil and suffering and make them more bearable. You might say, in its penetration into this realm, the kingdom of the heavens offers sustaining hope and help for people whose lives are racked with weakness, pain, and loss.   One summary of how this works can be found in Matthew 5:1-12, Bible verses otherwise known as The Beatitudes. For example, Matthew 5:5 says: \\"Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.\\" Meekness would not ordinarily be valued in a world that is as competitive and power-hungry as ours. However, the words of Matthew 5:5 indicate that, in the operation of the kingdom of the heavens here on earth, meekness, not power-mongering, is the path to blessing.    In 1Q84, Tengo and Aomame become obsessed with escaping the realm in which they find themselves and each other. They return in the end to the ordinary realm from which they came, where the deep longings of their hearts will continue to go unmet. By contrast, in the biblical Christian worldview, whenever people live in proper relation to the kingdom of the heavens through faith in Jesus Christ, life in this world not only becomes bearable; it becomes abundantly meaningful and satisfying.    For more on what it means to live in proper relation to the kingdom of the heavens through faith in Jesus Christ, go to nipponinitiative.org.

Parts of it are hysterical. Playing the game is often laugh-out-loud funny.  The game concept, design, graphics, and other content easily deserve 5 stars, but I'm only giving PvZ for Android 4 stars. It worked perfectly on my Motorola Xoom until the Android 4.0.3 update broke it. My Samsung Galaxy II S Epic Touch 4G force closes the game now and then. I think PopCap should either update their list of unsupported devices or redesign the app to offer broader compatibility; my preference, of course, being the latter.

Bush is a conceptual artist as well as being a singer with an exceptionally beautiful voice--a kind of musical genius who traffics in material that makes you think and makes you dream off-kilter dreams. While \\"50 Words for Snow\\" does not possess the soaring metaphysical heights of \\"Aerial\\"--one of my favorite albums of a type of music I can't ever quite define--not opera nor pop nor jazz nor folk, \\"Aerial\\" is a concept album of rare depth and breadth, as is \\"50 Words for Snow\\"--it's just the latter album does not possess the same orchestrated layers of complexity-the same resolute direction towards an other-worldliness. This is also probably why I could listen to \\"50 Words for Snow\\" five times in a row when it first arrived--all the better to let the maturing, eccentric voice and psyche of Kate Bush get under my skin and stay there. As an album, it's a little more down to earth, and what's wrong with that?

B005NNML6K|4.0|Not much to say about the release. One of the Stones best efforts ever, clean and pristine on heavy vinyl. It sounds better than ever! BUT heads up - the cover is not a replica of the original with the cut-outs for the slide out album jacket pictures. It is just a reprint of the original cover. Maybe I am getting grumpy, but if you are going to do a vinyl re-issue, why not replicate the coolest album jacket the Stones ever did (except for maybe the 3D Satanic Majesties)? I'd have gladly paid a few $ more for that. And it brings the 5 stars down to 4.

B0040JHLM2|4.0|Yes this shoes is very comfortable and it feels like you are walking on clouds as everyone says.<br />But something about the design of the shoe that really bothered the side of my small 5th toe. I have never had this happen<br />to me with any other shoe before. Turns out I have had a bunion all along, and sadly it took this shoe and a trip to the podiatrist<br />to point it out. What a drag. Now I am going to move over to a 4E shoe.
B0037QGS0K|3.0|Prior to watching this remake, I had seen the 2003 French film \\"Nathalie\\" which is the original title.  I wasn't all too happy with \\"Nathalie\\" because it was all talk.  Here we are promised a sexy thriller and while we get the sexy, with the surprising Amanda Seyfried and not surprising Julianne Moore, we also get some laborious dialog.  The filmmakers (directed by Atom Egoyan) finally decide to add a little suspense at the end but it just seemed added on to me.  Don't get me wrong, it works as a drama most of the time and both the ladies are worth the price of admission.  It's just a bit of a letdown.
0439023483|4.0|The end of 2011 and the beginning of 2012 found me reading the Steve Jobs bio by Walter Isaacson.  Why does this matter?  Because, I normally don't do non-fiction... just like I normally don't do young adult.  However, after my favorite author, one of my favorite publishers, and numerous other people told me that I needed to read it, I figured why not?  So I once again stepped out of my comfort zone and waded into waters not seen since Jr. High.  And I'm glad I did.<br /><br />I cracked open this book (OK fine... I swiped open my iPad) and did not stop until the end.  This book quickly grabs you and doesn't let go until about the last fourth.  I'll get to that later.  The first three fourths of this book I flew through it like Katniss at a buffet.  This being a YA book I didn't expect the amount of violence to be what it was.  It wasn't gratuitous or anything but it was definitely was there.  If you don't know the premise of this book that could only mean one thing; you were born yesterday.  Think `Lord of the Flies' meets `The Running Man' meets any high school in America.<br /><br />It's a murderous game of cat and mouse and you only have to survive.  That's it.  Oh yeah, you must compete against twenty-three other kids, on TV, with the odds stacked against you, on little to no water and food.  Piece of cake, right?  The first ¾ of this book is a fast paced, fun, bloody adventure.  The unfortunate thing for this book is that when the numbers of kids start to dwindle, so does the action.  It turns into an introspective of Katniss and it doesn't have the same magic as the beginning.  Now, I did finish it because it WAS good but I hated that it went that direction.  I think that reader of YA books will still (obviously with the numbers this series is putting up) enjoy this series, but from a reader who needs a book finish as strong as it starts, I wasn't completely taken.<br /><br />I was debating on whether or not I would read this series straight through so I left it to chance.  If I liked the way this book ended I would continue.  If I didn't, I would still read it, but not straight through.  Seeing as I've already started `Legion' by Simon Scarrow, I have my answer.  Again, I didn't dislike this book but I was hoping for something...  else.way this book ended I would continue.  If I didn't, I would still read it, but not straight through.

B005HP2JAM|3.0|Director/documentarian Werner Herzog assembles a small film crew to explore a recently discovered cave in southern France.  The cave is unique in that large, ornate wall art was found dating back more than 30,000 years.  Twice as old as any others found.  The government only allows scientists of various stripes into the cave and for relatively brief periods.  There are several arrays of drawings, but it doesn't take 90 minutes to see them, so Herzog adds some interesting interviews with archeologists, art historians and the like.  One of the young Frenchman is particularly interesting, especially telling one story of how Australian Aborigines felt about cave art.<br /><br />A beautiful musical score is layered across the film which certainly adds a reverent quality.  In fact, the score was recorded in an ancient church.  There is a \\"special feature\\" that documents all this on the Blu ray disc.  Ultimately, I was left with a lot of unanswered questions.  What material was used to produce the paintings?  Why are only animals depicted?  Why are there no trees, mountains...or people? This disc is in 3-D but I only viewed it in the 2-D format and the transfer is just fine, especially given the low light conditions inside the cave.  I understand the 3-D version shown in theaters is spectacular.

0316044695|2.0|Weak.  Weak writing (think 4th grade level).  Weak story.  The potential was there, but Luttrell, or whoever actually wrote this book, just missed the boat BADLY.  Others have already written about how Right Wing and anti-media the book is, along with pro-God, but my biggest issue with it is Luttrell's attitude.  Bear with me here.  So, his team gets compromised by goat-herders.  They have the option of either letting them go or killing them. They go through the reasons why or why not to do either choice.  They actually vote on it (possible, but seems unlikely)!  Here's the deal though.  Luttrell says right in the book that if they killed the herders, someone would miss them, plus the goats would linger around and reveal their position.  So right there was the NUMBER ONE reason not to kill them.  Yet, inexplicably, he chooses to blame a media that wasn't even there for this decision.  It was his decision!!!!  He said in the book that it was his decision and that he'd have to live with it, but clearly he is NOT living with it, and so in an effort to clear his own conscience (which should be clear anyway), he has chosen to blame the media.  Elements of the story seem quite unbelievable, but I was not there, so who's to say?  But the whole \\"kill them/don't kill them/let's blame the media thing\\" was just laughable.

B005UKJX4E|2.0|I liked the idea behind the movie, and it was beautifully filmed, but it dragged on and I became very bored.  There were a lot of long artsy pauses and scenes that did not add to the story; A few of these scenes would have been very appropriate and much appreciated, but the directors went too far.  The film could have been half the length and told the story more effectively.

0385534639|5.0|The Night Circus is a simple story but told by a wonderfully imaginative author. It borders on experimental with changes between first and third person and even second person but the author keeps the narrative thread going. The story is not lost with these narrative hand offs and keeps moving forward.  The real beauty of this novel is the visual world Morgenstern creates. Descriptions are done so vividly and gracefully that they pull you into the store and make you want to splash around in it. I'm reminded of Marquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude. Every once in a while I'll pick up a translation of that book, thumb to some random page and start reading. I just soak up the beauty of the prose. I think I'll be doing the same with The Night Circus.  I loved this book.

145162445X|4.0|This book is unfortunately just not long enough. I thoroughly enjoyed reading his explanations for why all points in the universe look as if they are the center of the expansion, of how we arrived at the age of the universe, the discovery of dark matter and dark energy, or how we know we live in a flat universe and how it came to be that way, etc.   I bought this book hoping it would take me beyond Brian Greene's \\"Fabric of the Cosmos\\", especially in regards to explaining how \\"negative pressure\\" arises from the vacuum and produces the repulsive \\"negative gravity\\" that is dark energy. I found that it did not. Perhaps explaining such concepts arising from equations in layman's terms defies even the finest science writers. Or it could just be me.   He takes on questions with theological import, such as how the universe and the laws of physics can arise from nothing, and concludes that there is no need to introduce a creator, but drags the weak anthropic argument out of the closet. I must admit I am disappointed that a Theory of Everything, with all of the finely tuned paramaters falling out of the equations naturally, is looking more and more unlikely, but as Krauss says, \\"The universe is the way it is, whether we like it or not.\\"

B0041KKYBA|5.0|A neighbor of mine had raved about INSIDE JOB, but, with the caveat to not watch it if \\"you're feeling depressed.\\" Yes, ladies and gentlemen. I won't lie to you. This documentary (from what you probably gathered from the title) basically uncovers the fleecing of our nation's (and perhaps, the globe's) economic stability and reputation. With narration by actor Matt Damon, we are walked through, step by step, the demise that came due to our economic meltdown (recession/depression) in 2008. Real estate terminology is clearly articulated, in layman's terms, so, the viewer can clearly understand how those involved in the shady dealings, related to housing, \\"turning\\" dwellings for profit, financial analysts and brokerage firms (businesses whose names I won't drop here), and extremely shady so-called economists turned tricks for hard and fast cash, all the while indulging in houses of prostitution, lines upon lines of cocaine (written off as \\"business expenses\\") royally messed up the day-to-day stability of countless millions of Americans, their pocket books and the job market. The effect was so profound that banks in Iceland and other nations felt the pain extremely hard, as far as employment rates and financial leverage were concerned.<br /><br />This film will infuriate you, make you want to holler and, most of all, continue to educate yourself - so as not to be duped by The Man. Really worth watching. I am going to see it again, because I, no doubt, missed a lot of information, the first go around.

B000M5AJQI|5.0|There are just a few movies that I feel like watching again several times and this is one of them.  I am not necessarily a Martin Scorsese fan but this movie certainly delivers.  The movie is about an odds-are-against-him character played by DiCaprio who rises above circumstance and becomes a police officer.  Because he has already been indoctrinated to the way organized crime works in Boston and some of his family members are still minor players, the undercover police section discretely asks him to work for them.  Only Martin Sheen & Mark Wahlberg know about his assignment and they meet with him clandestinely to get his reports.  This is a thriller that leaves you on the edge of your seat - you know the score but the characters do not.  It's also a wrenching testament to the toll that undercover work exacts on the police officers who undertake it.  In this movie, the betrayal by an police force insider leaves DiCaprio without protection and on his own.  The movie underscores hypocrisy since those (e.g., the corrupt Priest) whose outward occupations garner instant respect from society are not necessarily worthy of it as contrasted by DiCaprio's character, who sacrifices his hard-won reputation (outwardly) to serve a greater good yet remains a stellar person who never receives (from society) the respect or accolades he truly deserves.  Highly recommended!

B003Y5H5EW|5.0|Okay, I just got back from the midnight showing of this movie, which by the way is technically the fourth movie in the [[ASIN:B0000VAFO0 Underworld]] series and arguably the second best one in the series after of course the first one. This movie takes place 12 years after the second film in the series, [[ASIN:B000I9X54Q Underworld: Evolution]] although we do see a brief scene that takes place just a few months to maybe a year after the end of the second film.<br /><br />Now I am not one to post spoilers, but I will set the premise of this film up for you, which by the way comes from the first couple of minutes of the movie.<br /><br />Shortly after the end of the second movie, humans find out about the actual existence of both lycans and vampires. So obviously the humans go on a rampage and hunt down and destroy all lycans and vampires, which is eventually referred to as, \\"The Purge.\\" It is during this time period that both Michael and Selene attempt to get out of the area and our instead ambushed and captured by the humans. Flash forward twelve years and this is where the story starts to unfold.<br /><br />Now like I said earlier, I am not going to reveal any real spoilers, but I will throw you a couple of appetizers such as the chief villain in the movie being played by Stephen Rea, whom you might recall from such movies as; [[ASIN:0783116934 Citizen X]] and [[ASIN:B001R0O9K4 Michael Collins]]. He plays a government sanctioned scientist leading the way in creating a \\"cure\\" or vaccine to combat against vampirism. You are also introduced to two new characters, one of which can best be described as a unique combination of lycan and [[ASIN:B001DHXT20 The Incredible Hulk]] from Marvel Comics fame, while the other reminded me of a cross between the scary little girl played in the classic horror movie [[ASIN:B0049MAXQG The Exorcist]] and the freaky little ghost girl in the newer horror movie based on the original Japanese version of [[ASIN:B00005JLTK The Ring]]. Another really cool part of the movie was a couple of unique, although not entirely surprising, plot twists that really grabbed my attention and made the movie all that more entertaining.<br /><br />One thing that really stood out for me in this movie was what a really vicious and totally un-remorseful vampire Selene has become since the first two installments of the Underworld series. She is much meaner and grittier in this movie than the first two, and of course just as beautiful if not even more so than before. If you are a fan at all of good action vampire/werewolf movies, and especially the Underworld series, you will not be disappointed at all by this latest installment. Well, maybe a little because you will be disappointed when it ends although it does leave an opening for another installment in the series, which I am quite sure they are already in various stages of producing it as you read this. At least I hope so!<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.was a couple of unique, although not entirely surprising, plot twists that really grabbed my attention and made the movie all that more entertaining.

0439023521|5.0|I received the whole Hunger Games series as a Christmas present and I was finished with them in the first week of the New Year. The first book is, in my opinion, the best. Generally in any series whether books, movies or both, the first is the best and the Hunger Games is no exception. I picked up the book on December 27 and the only reason that I put it down was because I had to get some sleep! Suzanne Collins knows how to get the reader right into the story. Almost any book starts out with an introduction that gets the reader interested in the story and gives a general description that introduces the characters. The Hunger Games does this but right in the first chapter you feel all these emotions for the characters even though they haven't had a chance to develop throughout the story. Collins dives right in and gets you hooked! The Hunger Games is not a book for the faint of heart and it can be a bit gruesome at times, but that combined with the wonderful characters, plot line and imagery makes for one of the best books I've ever read!

B00005B36H|5.0|Lateralus was the first song I heard from this album and the first TOOL song I had ever listened to. As soon as Lateralus's opening was finished and the song burst forth into its beautiful and intricate mathematics based infrastructure, a slow smile creeped upon my face. The first thing I noticed was that TOOL was unlike any band I had ever heard (and I listen to a wide variety of music from alternative and progressive to metal, posthardcore, and classical/orchestra). I couldn't and still cannot pinpoint exactly what it is that makes TOOL any different than the innumerable amount of bands that exist today. It isn't specifically the genius and raw emotional talent of Maynard James Keenan or his chilling and mind opening lyrics. No, he isn't the sole reason the band has climbed to the pinnacle of the rock throne in many listener's minds. Nor is it Danny Carey's uncanny ability to flawlessly switch time signatures with minimal effort while decisively directing the flow of the song without you even realizing what happened. Adam Jones' guitar playing ebbs and flows and nestles itself directly into the listener's soul. The way the guitar is utilized by Jones speaks in and of itself. The guitar gently guides the listener to the inner most parts of his mind as he tries to answer questions about himself and the universe that he previously had no knowledge of, and behind all the layers the band meticulously works through is Justin Chancellor'a skillful bass playing that shows he knows how to interest the listener through deep and powerful bass notes that work with the guitar to move the mind to wherever it wants to wander yet are independent enough to stand on their own.<br /><br />None of these things are particularly unique. Musicianship and talent shine in several bands, however, when these four guys get together and work on music, a beautiful world is created that few others, if any, can even compare to. Indeed, TOOL is greater than the sum of its parts, TOOL is more thanJUST Keenan, Jones, Carey, or Chancellor individually and it shows so well with the experience known as Lateralus. The beauty of TOOL is that the band members never release anything until they are comfortable that they've created a masterful and layered, complex cohesive piece of art, for that is the only way to describe it. They never cease to draw me in and keep me mesmerized while I whittle away the hours thinking and exploring the reality around me.<br /><br />Now, on to the cd itself. I am heavily biased about this cd because I bought Lateralus while on a college visit and I had no means to listen to the cd until I got home. Little did I know that a blizzard would hit and cause the van I was in to roll upside down into the median. I was sitting down calmly sifting through the unique artwork that TOOL includes with their album releases when next thing I knew we were upside down in the snow. After opening the door and climbing out, I was greeted by an EMT who had asked me if everyone was ok. Everyone climbed out and we proceeded to scour the wreckage for our belongings. My friend shouted \\"Hey, your cd's okay!\\" to which I went over to him and inspected Lateralus. It had one scratch and some dirt on it, but otherwise it was flawless. We all gathered our luggage and went to a Department of Highways station where we waited for another ride home. The mud is still on my cd case. I refuse to remove it as it is a constant reminder of the experience I went through. After arriving home the first thing I did was make a cup of coffee, relax in a hot bath, and put my cd in. I was absolutely shocked.<br /><br />The first song \\"The Grudge\\" exploded into an energetic scale of peaceful aggressiveness. TOOL couldn't have chosen a better way to open a cd. TOOL does what they do best on this song, they build. The song constantly builds off of itself, repeating and changing crucial sections till they sound vaguely familiar but noticeably unique.<br /><br />Then I was treated to \\"EonBlue Apocalypse\\". A one minute song that has deep emotion in its few notes. The perfect way to settle the mood for the next song while still keeping the idea of the previous aggression from \\"The Grudge\\".<br /><br />\\"The Patient\\" is the next journey I get to travel. The slow melodic pace of the song trots along as it slowly builds up and peaks, then treks back down to a quiet valley of personal experience and pain. This is one of my favorite songs on Lateralus as its peaceful at parts with little more than the guitar and a few light taps from Danny. The Patient is very personal to Maynard as the lyrics are based on the experience his mother had to endure for several years.<br /><br />Next comes \\"Mantra\\" an odd track but one that serves its purpose well. TOOL puts a lot of songs in their releases that may seem like filler material. Whether or not it is is up to the listener. I personally believe that it's one that can be skipped without missing anything from Lateralus but others may not feel the same. Supposedly \\"Mantra\\" is Maynard lightly squeezing his cat and slowing down the recording, however that's just what I've heard.<br /><br />Moving along I get to one of the best riffs in any song I've ever heard. The bass lines for \\"Schism\\" are rough and powerful while the guitar oddly skips along to lead the procession. A beautifully unique and complex song that draws in with the opening riff and slowly allows the listener to experience what he/she wants from the song. I've listened to \\"Schism\\" so many times and it truly is different each time as I notice subtle differences in parts that I previously thought to have had completely memorized. Schism's lyrics are very poetic and warn of tragedy by man against man.<br /><br />\\"Parabol\\" is where I truly became invested into Lateralus. Sitting there in the relaxing warmth of the water, with eyes closed and mind opened, I heard a pleading prelude into the definition of humanity. \\"Parabol\\" is the perfect song that sets the moodwonderfully for the next track \\"Parabola\\". It's little more than Maynard singing as if he's a man distantly preparing himself for a message by slowly holding out notes almost as if he's humming, and Adam playing the music that this man would hear in his mind as he mentally contrives his opus.<br /><br />This song has personal history with me now after what I went through before listening. \\"Parabola\\" is a man's tale about who he is as a human and how he sees his life. The lyrics that have stuck with me the moment I heard them are \\"This body holding me, reminds me of my own mortality/ embrace this moment remember we are eternal all this pain is an illusion\\" and \\"Recognize this as a holy gift and celebrate this chance to be alive and breathing\\". I had come so close to death in that very day that I stopped and thought about this message, this song provided me with a cathartic experience. It is so easy to forget what truly matters in life that constant reminders are needed to break us out of our personal worlds in order to experience reality as it truly is.<br /><br />\\"Ticks and Leeches\\" is the exact opposite of \\"Parabola\\" and that contrast is what makes the placement of this track such a great decision. Its harsh and raw with Maynard belting out rough vocals mostly the whole song and Danny progressively getting more and more intense as the song goes on.<br /><br />\\"Lateralus\\" is a truly unique piece of art. The Fibonacci sequence is a prominent theme throughout this song. The rhythm follows the first few numbers of the Fibonacci sequence in ascending then descending order. The Fibonacci sequence is a naturally occurring sequence of numbers where the next number in the sequence is the addition of the previous two numbers. For example, the first numbers (and the one that the chorus's syllables are based on) are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. 0 and 1 are 1, 1 and 1 are 2, 1 and 2 are 3 so on and so forth. So, in relation to the song, the chorus with the number of syllables in parentheses is, \\"Black (1)/ then (1)/ white are (2)/ all I see (3)/ in my infancy (5)/ red and yellow then came to be (8)/ reaching out to me (5)/ lets me see (3)\\". Later in the song Maynard sings about how we should \\"ride the spiral to the end/ and may just go where no one's been\\". When the Fibonacci sequence is graphed it forms a spiral that gets progressively larger. It has no end. This is what Maynard is talking about, human beings exploring and discovering new ideas and inventions, going ever further mentally and physically for the sake of intelligence and design.<br /><br />The next three songs, \\"Disposition\\", \\"Reflection\\", and \\"Triad\\", are considered a trio and often played back-to-back during live shows. Often I will find myself confused as to when the song changes to the next when I listen to them. All three are beautiful in their own way and often mellow out my mood, the perfect songs to somberly ponder upon perplexities as precipitation pours down. \\"Disposition\\" and \\"Reflection\\" are the slow somber songs, whereas \\"Triad\\" picks up the intensity. \\"Triad\\" is an AMAZING guitar song and Adam Jones shows here that he knows exactly what he's doing to his equipment whenever he touches it.<br /><br />\\"Faiip de Oiad\\" means \\"Voice of God\\". It is a recording of a man ranting about aliens while TOOL accompanies the frantic feeling of the song.<br /><br />That was my experience with Lateralus and it is why I consider it one of the best written albums of this generation. Hands down, TOOL is at the top of their artistry career and I look forward to their next exploration. (All lyrics were taken from TOOL's website as TOOL does not add lyrics with their albums for artistic reasons)
0385534639|4.0|You can read this book without a classic book education on Norse, Icelandic, Chinese, Egyptian, Babylonian, Greek and Roman myths or the occult.  But it helps.<br /><br />I was struck by the dreamlike quality of the story, the beauty of the various exhibits in the circus, and the mysteries that are dominated by magic.  The imagery is spectacular.<br /><br />One glaring dissonance for me was the continuing devotion of Marco and Celia towards their respective fathers despite abuse and lack of affection. They both possessed strong magic that never led them to rebelliousness or real testing of their fathers' will. Instead, they were loyal beyond belief.<br /><br />Years ago I watched on PBS a series called 'The Power of Myth' by Joseph Campbell. That led to his book series, 'The Masks of God.' It demonstrated that biblical stories came from previous, much older cultures such as the Egyptians and the Babylonians had. I became an informed person about mythology, but certainly no scholar.  However, literary novels are full of mythological allusions and Campbell's books opened up my mind to understand books like 'The Night Circus' better.<br /><br />This book is a literary masterpiece of world myths and occult mysteries. The real story here is about deciphering the gods' and goddesses' identities, the folk tales and religious stories, and the occult symbols. The overarching theme appears to be the Chinese concept of Yin-Yang. This is the concept used to describe the polar opposites that are interconnected and interdependent in the world. Opposites exist in relation to each other. There were dozens and dozens sets of twinning in the book- concepts, people, events, philosophies.<br /><br />Tsukiko, the contortionist, had ALL the mythological symbols tattooed on her body; among them the Egyptian Ankh, Norse Runes, Chinese characters, all related to famous myths. Plus, she could bend her spine forwards and backwards, a classic reference to seeing the past and future, and she specifically mentions that the symbols on her body were who she 'was, is, and will be.'. Knowing all the was, is and will be is why the God Oden gave up his eye in return for the wisdom seeing all of time gave him.  Humans live in time of course and we live by and love clocks. Gods are timeless since they are immortal, which gives them a psychological outlook about time, mortals like us, boredom and games we can only imagine, as the author has obliquely done here.<br /><br />Every culture in the world has tree myths, passed down from times before writing existed. Most cultures practiced oneiromancy and have ancient dream interpretation texts. Further, Hector and Alexander are famous ancient Greek heroes. The Greek and Roman gods are very psychopathic and manipulative towards mortals, which is demonstrated quite often in ancient plays and stories such as The Iliad and the Odyssey where us mortals have our fates and destinies set by gods feeling frisky, bored or angry, with absolutely no concern over our feelings about the twists and turns our short lives take because of their interference. The biblical story of Job probably grew out of this traditional story device.<br /><br />Also, the physical positions the performers take when performing are mirror images of Tarot card figures.<br /><br />Lastly, poppets are voodoo dolls.<br /><br />I did not love this book, or like the characters. Literary works are usually meta-fictional, and this book is certainly that. It is SO consciously meta, in my opinion, depending on how aware you are, it's either too mysterious and vague or it's too literary for much emotional connection to obvious literary symbolic people who never read  like real people. I couldn't connect anyway, even though I admire the book very much.ere who she 'was, is, and will be.'.

B00447G29S|4.0|Any 3d movie is best viewed at an IMAX theater but for viewing at home, this is about as good as it gets.  I think that a great deal of the credit for this is the quality of the original 3D.  Most Movie makers do not  realize that 3d in a movie is a separate art in itself, as is either color or black and white.  It seems to me that most 3d movies today have the 3d tacked on as just a way to get few extra dollars on a ticket price. This film is an early use of 3d that wasn't surpassed until Avatar. (Kudos to Robert Zemekis)  You add to this a good kids friendly story and great animation and you have a product well worth owning.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I purchased three of these microphones at different times from different sellers and received different microphones.<br /><br />The difference mainly lies in the fact that one I received was \\"mono\\" and the other two (purchased from \\"DependableResource\\" Seller) record in stereo. All the mics say \\"ATR 3350\\" on them, but it's hard to know what you'll get until you receive -- whether a mono or a stereo mic.<br /><br />However, all the mics work fine.  Just a \\"buyer beware\\" that you could get either one purchasing from this listing.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I'm not sure why I spent $30 on a case that's made horribly.  The back/side casing of the cover is a hard plastic coated with the rubber like material to make it look and feel the same as the front cover.  In principle that's great.  In reality the coating is garbage and even in you take care of the case (isn't the all point of the case to protect, not to have to be protected) it will peel.  My kindle goes in a jacket pocket (yes I actually have a pocket big enough for it) with no other items to go to work with me and for the return trip home.  The rest of the time it is on a desk if I'm not actually reading it.  Yet all the back corners have peeled and now the sides are peeling too.<br /><br />Also to note cover is so tight it's actually peeling the coating on the back of the kindle in the top corner...  Not that you should take your kindle out often (I only did not for this review and noticed it).<br /><br />EDIT: I reached out to Customer Service via their website and it looks like they also reached out to me via this review.  I will go through their process and update this review as needed.  Hopefully I just received a defective case and will have no issues with a replacement.<br /><br />EDIT: Customer service for Marware is on top of their game.  I am getting a new cover.  I am changing the cover type so I won't be able to review whether or not I see the same issue but for there high quality CS I am updating my review to 5 stars because at the end of the day, no matter what they stand behind their product.  A rare and important thing for me.

0525478817|5.0|This is the first of John Green's books that I've had the pleasure to read at it's release date, but I'm only getting around to reviewing it now, though I read it right away. This was book was amazing, funny, heart-wrenching, and nearly un-putdownable. I loved it. There may have been tears. It was wonderful and moving.  I could sit here and continue to gush-goodness knows I've done it enough to my friends. I'll leave you with this: I don't get emotional with books. I love books and become invested, but rarely do they move to me to laugh out loud or shed any tears. I'm not a crier with either books or films. However, this did both. I laughed out loud, and I welled a bit, because I was so invested in the characters. This is a book I'll reread and enjoy just as much the second time around.  Read my full review here: [...]

B006WPSQVC|1.0|I could not even finish watching this movie it was so bad. Too preachy for my taste, and very misleading because the star rating was good. I'm sure its all the religious supporting this film, nothing wrong with that but its just not a good movie at all.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app is very useful for saving youtube videos on your kindle.  The main place I get my wi-fi from blocks youtube so I download the videos when I can and watch them were wick blocks it or if I don't have wifi
B002ZG974M|5.0|When I first saw this video it was with my mom. We both have a strong affinity for babies. I have since watched it with my husband and sister-in-law making that a total of three times. And each time I watch it I catch a deeper glimpse into the babies.  The movie goes through the first year of four babies from four different backgrounds. My favorite baby was the Mongolian baby. He showed absolute spunk throughout the film. He also was the only boy in the film, so maybe I'm just all about the underdog. My second favorite baby would have to be the one from Japan, but this is only because of her scene where she tries to put a stick in a hole, and after continuing to not succeed has a tantrum of despair. I personally love though how during this scene the director contrasted this modern day child with the little boy who is tied to a bedpost and just playing with a piece of toilet paper and is extremely happy with himself. Where she is trying to master placing a stick in a hole while also trying to pretend read, but becomes frustrated because she can't. (I know it might seem cruel to laugh at a baby having a tantrum, but the way she goes about it is just too adorable and funny.) This film is great because it compares and contrasts the different babies and just goes to show how resilient children really are. It reminds me that as a parent, I do need to be concerned with the health of my child, but at the end of the day her putting a rock in her mouth or playing in the dirt really won't hurt.  The only part I dislike is the American mom, although now that I am becoming a mom and understand that clothes can be somewhat en-cumbersome when choosing to breast-feed you can still wear a bathing suit in your jacuzzi and a sleeping-bra when in bed if someone is filming you. And I thought the mother earth thing was really silly especially in comparison to the African baby who really was dealing with mother earth.  So would I recommend? Yes ... if you are the kind of person who enjoyswatching babies and can bring your own narrative to the story.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|It did what I needed it to do - replace the old, crumbling, worn-out thermal compound for my computer's CPU - and how! I was amazed at how much faster and QUIETER my machine was working after I used this. I will say this much, though - the tube it comes in is a bit underwhelming, suffice to say the least. There is MUCH more compound in it than what you'd ever expect from such a deceptively tiny thing. I'm pretty sure I could use this on quite a few computers if I needed to!

B005YVTHT0|5.0|I've had the SRW-S1 now for about three months, and let me say, it is ingenious.  I have four standalone racing games, GTR2, Dirt2, Dirt3 and F1 2011, and now, with the included card to play online with SIMRACEWAY, a race game made specifically for SRW-S1 as well.  All the games I've tried so far, GTR2, Dirt3 and F1 2011 , all work flawlessly with it.  All buttons on the wheel can be re-mapped to the games.  However, the shift LED-lights along the top do not work for the games other than SIMRACEWAY with the exception of F1-2011.  A patch is now provided by SIMRACEWAY which will incorporate the shifting lights.  One additional caveat, DIRT3 will not retain your wheel control setting. Hopefully, either Steelseries or CODEMASTERS will release a fix for this.<br /><br />The precision of the wheel was a very pleasant surprise. I had seen videos before purchasing of people driving, but had no idea the precision and response would be so crisp.  Its precision is close, or the same, as the Logitech G27.<br /><br />I've read several reviews that one of the perceived drawbacks is its main positive attribute, and that being you have to hold it up since it is unmounted.  The argument is, your arms will fatigue over time.  True... IF that is the way you hold it the entire time driving.  But you will quickly find you can rest it on your lap, and even better yet, lay back in a recliner, get comfortable, rest it on your lap and race for literally hours. So to me, being unmounted and being very light weight, is now the way to go.<br /><br />There is another considerable advantage the wheel has over mounted wheels, and that is its ability to control the car by moving the wheel laterally WITHOUT rotating the device.  This adds a subtle layer of control.  It may hamper someone new to the wheel, but once you become familiar with the nuance, you will have a slight advantage over a mounted wheel, at least in respect to control.<br /><br />Now. . .there are a couple of legitimate drawbacks.Since it IS unmounted, it is difficult in the middle of a race to have both hands free, even for a second. As I said, you can perch it on your lap for a second or two, but it's difficult since the slightest non-horizontal angle will make the car drift off course. The good news is, the brake and acceleration paddles allow it to rest on a flat surface upright.  To save weight, it is corded (not wireless, no batteries) and does not have force feedback. And since you, more or less, turn it in the air, there is also absolutely no turning resistance.<br /><br />Yes there are drawbacks, no force feedback, must have control if it at all times during a race, but if you can live with these small quibbles, I highly recommend it.
B00664AM5C|4.0|After a new virus breaks out, patient zero, a female executive from the states spreads the disease from Hong Kong to the US contaminating everything and everyone she touches. After the disease begins to spread, the CDC doctors and local officials work hard to contain the virus, and to find a cure. Hucksters, promoting miracle cures take advantage of the situation to hawk miracle cures with zero effectiveness. The story follows different characters as they follow different paths to the end goal- finding an antidote.<br /><br />While I did find the story enjoyable, I did think they could've handled certain elements better. For instance, I suspect that the doctor who 'notified' his wife prior to the outbreak, would've had his wife already in a protected area. Scientists can't really be expected to work effectively if their loved ones are running around inside known areas about to be quarantined. Second, I am not sure how it really helped to paint patient zero as an adulterous white woman having an illicit affair when she contracts the illness. It just gives the contagion a judgemental quality which I didn't like. Would she never have gotten the disease had she not insisted on having a photo taken with the chef who didn't wash his hands after chopping pig parts? Is this the fate of all evil cheating women?<br /><br />Overall, I did like the film. I like disaster films as a whole, and this one was handled well, and was full of characters I could relate to.

B003Y5H4Y8|4.0|Helen Mirren, Tom Wilkinson and the rest of the impressive acting crew gives compelling performance in this stunning thriller.  Story starts in 1966 in East Berlin, Germany and unrevels in 1997 In Tel Avi, Israel.  Daughter of the two former Israeli spies writes a novel about her parent's mission 30 years ago.  Their goal was to catch former Nazi concentration camp doctor who administered various medical experiments on Jewish prosoners: men, women and children.<br /><br />The mission is not just a story about the capture of the monster who used medicine as a means to torture people, but it is also a story about unfortunate love triangle between three Israeli spies.  Everyone in this story has their version of the events that took place during the mission.  It's main protagonists however pay their debt to the mission for the rest of their lives.  All three of them have their lives altered by this experience to the point of no return.<br /><br />Film flips between past events and current events.  All characters are well developed and complex.  Their motifs are unrelenting and unapologetic.  Their love triangle is one of those tragedies that can never be undone.  Fabulous actors and even more fabulous story.
B003VANOFY|2.0|I have had this headset for about a year now.  I used to own the Medusa 5.1 (independent speakers; unlike this set) and the surround effect was great.  Switching between the two headsets made things clear.  The Medusa set has serious sound quality issues.  The G930 sound quality was much better.  MUCH better.  My old set had great bass response but the Logitech, I was impressed by the bass response as well for not being discrete.  Very full sound.<br /><br />The cones cover the ears completely.  They fit so well, outside sound is almost gone.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it comes down to practical everyday use.  I use my headset daily.  The G930 fails every day.  When I am in a game, I am being yelled at to turn my mic off and that my mic sucks.  Not the words you want to hear after laying down all that cash on a headset.  It has to be true when I hear the same complaints over the past year.  I used to argue, \\"but I bought Logitech's best...\\" nah.  Logitech failed on this one.  Even while I am playing a game, the audio drops out for 30 seconds at a time. If audio is failing, I can only imagine what the mic is doing.<br /><br />I own a lot of Logitech products that I love, but this is not one of them.  Very unhappy with the money I paid.<br /><br />Edit:  Since I wrote the review, the mic has physically broken.  The arm has broken where the bend occurs.  I treated this set well and I am not sure how it broke.  Other sets I have owned have never broken like this one.  I contacted Logitech and they are having me return this to them (they are paying shipping) for an exchange under warranty.

B005LAIGN2|1.0|Over twenty five years after the fact and Maverick has become a drunk who makes hasty decisions under the influence, Goose has become a bit more reckless and still puts women before anything else, and Iceman's role has been reduced significantly as his smug arrogance is only felt in a handful of lines. What's that you say? Red Tails isn't the urban retelling of Top Gun? Well, you could have fooled me. It's not that it makes much difference though. No matter how you look at it, Red Tails doesn't really have much of anything to offer.<br /><br />At the peak of World War II, African American pilots are considered the lowest of the low. They're considered to be incapable of performing their tasks to their country to the fullest and are given leftover missions that don't even qualify as scraping the bottom of the barrel. The Tuskegee training program is no different as the entire squadron is mostly reduced to shooting down trucks, trains, and perhaps a cow every now and then. That is until Colonel A.J. Bullard (Terrence Howard) succeeds in letting the higher ups give his men a chance and they take full advantage of the opportunity.<br /><br />Red Tails feels really cheesy as soon as that quote is shown in the opening scene. The movie has a $58 million budget, but it certainly doesn't feel that way considering the opening credits. The amalgamation of planes ripping through the sky and tearing each other to pieces feels like a distraction or a cover up for the rest of your senses. Try to pay attention to the credits, how plain they are, and how cheap they look. That along with the score that feels like it was ripped straight out of a stereotypical action film from the 90s doesn't really seem like the type of tone they were going for here. The acting isn't much better as stiffness and monotony seem to be what they were aiming for. The Tuskegee airmen do begin to get a bit more comfortable in their roles as the movie progresses. David Oyelowo takes Lightning the furthest as far as Easy's (Nate Parker) squad goes, but they certainly seem their best in the face of tragedy. Terrence Howard has a few great moments, as well. Specifically his \\"highest expectations\\" scene he shares with Joe \\"Lightning\\" Little. But it isn't enough to save a second-rate film.<br /><br />The script is very dry. I don't mean dry humor I mean about as pleasant as trying to listen to somebody with a mouthful of saltine crackers. It feels so stale and again contributes to that 90s atmosphere I mentioned earlier. Keep an ear out for the Americans and how third grade they sound. The dialogue along with the monotonous tone spread out amongst every actor in the film makes everyone come off as a robot. \\"These cows are armed,\\" is a line that's actually used in the movie. There are a few lines that are almost decent. Winky's (Leslie Odom Jr) line where he says, \\"Every time I close that canopy I feel like I'm closing the lid to my own coffin,\\" is surprisingly good. It gives the momentary belief that things may turn around, but they never do. Smokey's (Ne-Yo) \\"colored\\" conversation at the bar is the most amusing thing Red Tails has to offer, as well. There are many lame attempts at humor that just make you groan. Black Jesus is perhaps the worst joke of all, considering how things turn out for Deke (Marcus T. Paulk).<br /><br />I was expecting Red Tails to at least offer a fair amount of eye candy, but the special effects weren't really all that impressive at all. There's a train explosion early on in the film that's been shown in nearly every trailer and TV spot. It's pretty much on the same scale as the train crash in Super 8, but it isn't nearly as spectacular. That's kind of weird considering Super 8 was $8 million dollars cheaper than Red Tails when it comes to its budget. What ruined it for me was that sloppy zoom-in effect that's relied on as a crutch the entire movie. The Tuskegee airmen will be in the midst of a heated air battle with the Germans. The camera would pan up to try and capture the action, but it would zoom-in (or out on a few occasions) nearly every time to try and show you who should be keeping track of. It just came off as sloppy camera work to me, as if they didn't have the proper camera placement for the scene and tried to adjust it accordingly. There are several things that don't really add up in the movie either. One of the main ones for me was that at one point, Easy tells everyone that there's no time to celebrate a completed mission and to return to base because they're low on fuel. But can you guess what they do in the very next scene? They showboat and celebrate. Not listening to your superiors and still getting praised for it is an overbearing theme in the movie, as well.<br /><br />George Lucas fought for 23 years to get this made, but after viewing it you'll more than likely be convinced that the man has grown senile over the years and that retirement from Hollywood is the best thing for him. The turnout for the screening was insane and you can bet that Red Tails will more than likely make a killing at the box office, but there's no way in hell it passes as a good or even decent piece of cinema. Amateur cinematography, a boring script, terrible acting, and the fate of certain characters being extremely predictable (you can guess Lightning's fate around the time things start getting serious with Sophia), Red Tails is the equivalent of a stand-up act that gets booed off the stage. It is just awful. I was left wishing the entire movie was just Cuba Gooding Jr lifting a pipe to his lips, pulling it away, and pretending to smoke the entire film. If it was just those clips strung together with no dialogue and that dubstep track from the TV spot in the background, I could have at least gotten a good laugh out of it.it would zoom-in (or out on a few occasions) nearly every time to try and show you who should be keeping track of.

B005Q27EFQ|5.0|NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT THE PACKAGING AND NO BONUS TRACKS FOR THE 2011 REMASTER. FOR THOSE THAT HAD THE DVD-AUDIO THIS VERSION IS CLOSE TO IT WITH ONLY 2 CHANNEL INSTEAD OF 5.1 AUDIO. WITH THE EDIT VERSION OF DEVILS FOOD AND NOT THE EXTEND VERSION, SAME WITH STEVEN EXTRA GUITAR RIFF WHICH WAS NEVER ON THE OTHER VERSIONS. NOW I GOT THIS MINI LP SHM-CD, WHICH I DONT THINK STEVE HOFFMAN CAN DO IT ANY BETTER. BUT I DO LIKE TO HAVE IT ON GOLD DISC.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This application of the Bible is amazing and a lot more than what I expected.  The reader reads with passion and conviction.
B005V4X8JA|4.0|STEVE HOFFMAN DID A WONDERFUL JOB AT GIVIVG DIE HARD FANS WHAT THEY WANTED. EVERYTHING UPFRONT THE VOCALS AND THE INSTRUMENTS. NOT WHAT THE REGULAR ALBUM SOUNDED LIKE, SO IT WAS ALTERED. JUST LIKE THE NEW RUSH AND JETHRO TULL AQUALUNG. JAPAN CAME OUT WITH THE SHM-CD OF THIS TITLE AND SOUNDED THE WAY THIS ALBUM SHOULD SOUND. CRISP AND CLEAR WITH GOOD SEPERATION. STEVE HOFFMAN REMASTERED IT WITH GOOD SEPERATION AND GOOD TONE. SO BOTH WERE WORTH GETTING.

086571701X|5.0|This is a good introduction to the area of aquaponics.  It combines the concepts of raising fish and growing hydroponically in a closed system. The book is written at a level that can be understood with enough information to get your feet wet (bad pun). This is not written like a college text book.  It gives you ample insight into aquaponics without all the incomprehensible academic rhetoric of most of the other literature on this subject.  A great primer.
B0060ZJ74O|5.0|I really don't understand baseball. Like it, but don't really understand it. I can watch the game and understand superficially what's happening, but I don't get the strategy and, of course, it's all strategy. So, I went to see this in the theater and loved it and then just rewatched the blu-ray. Loved it, and only partly understand why. One thing: You can't take your eyes of Brad Pitt.  Not because of his good looks, but because he's just utterly charismatic and engaging.  Jonah Hill is an unexpected but perfect casting choice. But, overall, it's a tribute to the filmmakers that a movie that shouldn't work this well works this well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What a great book. A story about love and survival all wrapped up into one book.I could hardly put the book down.

0756655730|5.0|My hubby got me this as a Christmas present, oh boy do I love it!  The thing that I like about it is that it is organized by geological chronology, rather than sorted by animal type, so you get the sense of moving through time.  Also, of course, all the fantastic illustrations! Truly fascinating.
0525478817|5.0|\\"The Fault In Our Stars\\" is phenomenal and I don't mean that in a lame, fangirly way, it really is a fantastic book that captures what it means to be a teenager, to be a girl, and, I can only assume, to have cancer. The book manages to depict Hazel Grace Lancaster, a sixteen year old girl who happens to have cancer, as a smart girl who is dying of cancer who does not hold all the mystical secrets of the meaning of life- she is a normal girl who is pissed off that her life is being cut short. Hazel and, consequently, Augustus Waters' journey is full of joy and tears, but it is not a picturesque love, as the traditional \\"cancer book\\" would have it- nobody dies in the arms of the person they love, there is no \\"fighting together\\", there is only Hazel, reliant on pharmaceutical drugs and the scheduled draining of the fluid in her lungs to keep her alive, Augustus, with his \\"one point four legs\\" and \\"An Imperial Affliction\\". John Green's latest novel is honestly a great book- buy it, read it, make your friends read it. He even signed the whole first printing for us! DFTBA!!!!
B0058PJ6NE|3.0|Wtf? Downloading and watching musics videos is illegal? WRONG. (But I shouldn't care cause I buy music. Buying it is less of a hassle).
B000RZIGVS|3.0|...this set wasn't packaged well-when they made it-the discs overlap one another in plastic 'cases' which crack easily & the discs fall out-had they put them in PAPER cases INDIVIDUALLY,this may have saved the set-it's the 20th Anniversary set fer chrissakes! that is inexcusable! - i had to buy all the other seasons (1 to 7) in individual boxes for my wife- NO COMPLAINTS with those - for a lot of extra money!The main problem is that a lot of the discs don't play - & you know why? Because you have to have a very recent DVD player to play them! After trying to play them on her 'ancient' (8 years old!) CyberHome & Memorex DVD players - which made a 'grinding' sound & wouldn't play, i put them on my 2 year old Magnavox/Philips player & voila! they all play! They should market an 'region free' or all-region player in the USA or an upgradable player which will play discs that have 'glitschy' problems such as unreadable information that the old lasers can't 'read'[it doesn't have to be BluRay]-someway/somehow they should have this information on the box AND this information should be available to all consumers-folks, BUY THE INDIVIDUAL SEASONS in their own boxes & save yourself a nervous breakdown!...
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I still like the actual book better, but thid is a very nice app for on the go and a lot lighter. You also can set up for daily readings with different devotional Bibles. .
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I saw this movie in the theaters and on Amazon and still get a bit emotional in parts during this awesome Christian based movie that we need more of besides the so called movies that come out of Hollywood with sex, drugs, and nothing but violence and swearing.  This movie has its humorous parts in it and sad parts but this movie will make any father think and any man who is going to be a father think about how to raise his kids teaching them to respect others and themselves.  This movie is a must see.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good time waster if you're looking for one. fun games. some difficult and weird on a touch screen but still good.
B000MV8ABS|4.0|The tall man is a live personification of the very essense of horror, on par with Freddy Krueger and Pinhead (Hellraiser), like the disclaimer says: if this one doesn't scare you, you're already dead! From the most avid Horror fan in the world (I am not exaggerating)this is a must. You won't be dissapointed. Angus Scrimm is trully remarkable in his role as guardian of the dead souls. This particular DVD version was superb in quality and production. I have nothing else to say, no superlatives would suffice, just order one, then, unplug the phone, turn off the mobile, switch off the lights, clear your lungs and get ready for a ride. . . (warning - not for those with a weak heart). . . you hear me . . boy. . .
B000026FOA|5.0|I don't know how to describe the attraction that Nick Drakes music has, I found his name on wikipedia and checked it out on youtube. I have not been able to stop listening to this album especially riverman. Someone mentioned being caught at the right moment by a song and that I believe is accurate, if you heard this music at a party it would bomb but if like me you first heard it late in the afternoon on a lazy day when you felt a little down then nothing else equals Nick Drake.
B0050SYS5A|4.0|I just recently picked up the Zoom for my Microsoft Kinect. Its amazing, its allowed my friends and me to play two player Kinect games in front of our TV and couch. The small space originally only allowed for one person with out the Zoom. Now, we have more then enough room to play two player, and still move back if needed. The pictures that Kinect Adventures takes look much better too, shows the whole body vs chests and neck. I'd recommend this to anyone who bought the Kinect and uses it inside a dorm, apartment, small living room or bedroom. It snaps right to the Kinect, has a scratch cover for the face, makes Kinect's view roughly 40% better!  Completely satisfied,  DjayFresh

B0034G4ORC|1.0|I love alien movies. I love disaster movies. LOVE them. All of them. Except this one.  When people say a movie like this is bad, they usually mean the premise is stupid, or the action is just too over-the-top ridiculous to be believable. Which is why when people told me this movie was bad, I was not expecting it to be a boring, incoherent second-year film student project.  The characters are completely uninteresting, the camerawork and shot editing are a total mess, the sci-fi themes are several decades out of date (\\"They want our water!\\") and, I kid you not, FIRST CONTACT HAPPENS OFF SCREEN.  The only thing halfway decent are the special effects. But most of the time (seriously, the overwhelmingly huge majority of the time) is spent on shaky close-ups of the actors' faces during \\"dramatic\\" and \\"emotional\\" scenes that, trust me, you will not care about at all... so there are almost no effects shots. And the aliens are basically just guys in body-armor (or whatever) with guns. NORMAL guns. They might as well just be other humans. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but does make me wonder why they didn't just make this a regular war movie. Not that that would have improved it. It still would have been a terrible movie.  And it's not like I don't enjoy a good war movie. It's not like I don't get pulled in by emotional, dramatic scenes. I don't just watch movies like this for the effects and the cheap thrill. I pretty much ALWAYS cry. I just want to make that very clear. I'm definitely the type who gets sucked into the emotional plight of the characters in movies like this. But there just wasn't an opportunity for that to happen with this movie, not even for a few minutes. It sucked that bad.  Again, I love alien movies. I'll give every movie the benefit of the doubt, and suspend my belief through even the most ridiculous action and nonsensical disastrous event, but this is just another kind of bad entirely.  If you like alien movies... skip this. Go watch Attack theBlock instead.
B0002HWO82|5.0|The new Smurf movie was bound to create more Smurf toys and decorations. This set is perfect for my computer desktop. There are four pieces: the desk, the laptop (it folds!), the chair and the Smurf. The Smurf does not bend so you can't move the arms or legs. But still it's cute to look at!

0062082353|4.0|\\"American Sniper\\" is really two stories in one: Chris Kyle's journey to becoming the United State's most prolific military sniper ever; and a surprisingly frank account of a couple's marriage strained by the separation caused by the war and Kyle's commitment to the Teams.  Interwoven into the story of Kyle's deployments overseas and his brief times back at home are short sections supplied by Taya Kyle documenting her feelings and her side of the story.  The combination serves to provide a poignant contrast between the brutalities faced by warriors in battle and the worry and emotions ripping through their families at home.  I get the feeling that Chris Kyle is a man of few words because his descriptions of events and memories tend to be on the spare side. But the author's (Jim DeFelice) ability to capture the tone and meaning of Kyle's stories is excellent. You can pick up the cadence and rhythm of Kyle's speech with the one-liners leaving you chuckling. With a few haunting exceptions, there is almost always a comical or humorous side aspect to Kyle's stories.  For those who want to pick up a lot of detail about being a SEAL or a sniper, you're not going to get much. There are some nuggets in the stories that you can probably only mine if you have some knowledge of combat and shooting. For example, you won't find a reference to a Mil-Dot anywhere. But, Kyle talks about using a tree behind some insurgents to help him on an extremely long-distance shot. Shooters will know what he is talking about. Others probably won't get the significance of the tree. (His longest shot, by the way, was 2,100 yards taken to kill a bad guy getting ready to launch a rocket at an Army convoy).  He fairly brushes over his experiences during BUD/S and Hell Week, telling the reader that the process is well documented in other sources.  There is a bit of treasure on p. 126 (Geared Up) where he does give some good descriptions of his gear and the reasoning behind his likes and dislikes on each piece.  Likes? .45 over the 9mm; belt holster over the drop-leg holster. Depending on the mission he would carry an M-4, a Mk-11, a .300 Win Mag and, later, a .338 Lapua (which he used to the make 2,100 yard shot).  I found the book extremely fast-paced and I found the addition of Taya's sections valuable in making  this a very memorable account of their lives. I easily read it in a few sessions.  God bless Texas if the Lone Star State keeps producing heroes like Chris Kyle (and his buddy Marcus Luttrell). He doesn't mince words and calls the situation like he sees it. His experience gives him some very simple, yet insightful, answers to situations that seem to perplex politicians. He is a bad-ass and he hands out copious amounts of kudos for others who are bad-asses. Not surprisingly, he has few nice things to say about cowards and those unwilling to commit.  Great book. Entertaining and worth the read.
B006N57PXG|4.0|I bought this book many years ago when  it came out. For one reason or another I lost my copy never finishing it. Now many years later I was offered a chance to read it for review. Two days later here I am. This book was wonderful! It combined the best parts of several other series and twisted them to make it it's own. The main character is Nathaniel a 12 (10 at the start of the book) year old boy whose parents forfeit him to a magicians adoption service in exchange for money. Which as awful as it seems is prob for the best. What kid wants to stay in a home where his value can easily be exchanged just for money. Anyway eventually he is sent to live with the Minister of  Internal Affairs Arthur Underwood and his wife Martha.  Shortly thereafter Arthur Underwood hosts a party and this is where we are introduced to the villain of the story Simon Lovelace. Unfortunately for Nathaniel  he crosses paths with lovelace and incurs his wrath.  Following this incident Nathaniel vows to beat Lovelace and to become the best magician he can.  Two years pass and Nathaniel now twelve has grown considerably in skill still with his sights on Lovelace. Using a basic spyglass he looks in on Lovelace accepting a package from a shady looking mercenary supposedly containing The Amulet of Samarkand (hence the title).  Days later Nathaniel summons a djinni who orders him to steal the amulet from Lovelace and this is where the book really gets going. Your not going to get any spoilers from me though you will have to just read it yourself to see what happens. I personally cannot wait to read the next book in this series. It was a very good read that as stated above took two days to finish.  This is a perfect series for young teens and adults alike.  Im rating this 4 stars and want to thank  the publisher for letting me not only review the book but finish it finally.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is built darn near perfect. Idk what else they could do to it but as of now I love it.

This now holds a place of honor on our bookshelf!!

B00009W0WM|5.0|Perfect audio and video as clear as a crisp on this two disc set.<br /><br />Casablanca is that 1943 wartime favorite love story, with a most unforgettable cast.<br /><br />Humphrey Bogart plays the proprietor of Rick's American Club, a nightclub centered in the intrigue and action of German occupied French Morocco. The French have just capitulated to the Germans and established the Vichy government, a puppet pro-German government, but not all French authorities in Casablanca are in agreement. Claude Rains plays the chief of police and shrewdly entertains the German occupiers, as he continues taking care of number one.<br /><br />Paul Henreid plays a French resistance leader running for his life and hopeful of obtaining exit visas in Casablanca for he and his wife (Ingrid Bergman). But they are not the only ones. Many of the emigres are in desperate need of more money to buy a seat to Lisbon and from there America. The turnover of desperate souls all meet, dine, and gamble at Rick's where they convey the challenge of not knowing how to get out.<br /><br />Casablanca is a love story about nationalism and of people. Rick is introduced as a hard boiled businessman without patriotism or caring. His fellow nightclub owner (of the Blue Parrot) is played by Sydney Greenstreet, also an unscrupulous dealer. And to make the trio complete Peter Lorre plays a daredevil murderer who recently killed two German soldiers to get hold of the diplomatic pouch that contained two blank exit visas.<br /><br />The second disc contains the usual features one might expect; \\"a tribute to Casablanca\\", \\"Bacall on Bogart\\" - a candid discussion from Lauren Bacall on the life and career of her husband, Humphrey Bogart, and newly discovered deleted scenes and outtakes.<br /><br />All in all, this set is the way to go. The quality of the black and white footage is sharp, the sound unbroken. I already had a DVD of Casablanca but was not satisfied with the video. After viewing this set I threw the other away.<br /><br />Have a look see.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|some of the games at the start were challenging. but very entertaining for the most part. I liked it a lot.
0307949508|5.0|The second book in the Millennium trilogy picks up a year after Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist pulled off their various coups. Lisbeth has been traveling, but suddenly a dangerous thug seems to be trailing her. Through a strange course of events, Lisbeth is wanted by the police for murder.  I enjoyed this second installment in the trilogy significantly more than the first one. This book deals more with Lisbeth than with Mikael, and she is by far the more interesting character. Mikael, after all, is a man who liked going to prison because he found it \\"restful.\\" This book delves into some of the issues of Lisbeth's past, especially a devastating event that is mysteriously absent from her social services file.  This book is absolutely bursting with suspense, and this was a book I literally couldn't stop reading. I was desperate to see how all of the pieces fit together. Who is the mysterious giant? What happened in Lisbeth's past? Finishing this book made me want to start the next one immediately.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The entire series was good and Book 2 (Catching Fire) was my favorite, but Mockingjay shouldn't be short changed by any means.  An excellent ending to the series.  I saw some of the reviews that asked where why they strayed away from the characters that we came to love.  Quite Frankly, I don't know where that came from.  The characters were complete from book 1 to the end.  Each had their own ending, good or bad, but an ending never the less.  Just when you think Mockingjay is winding down the series, the next chapter rolls around and BAM, here's another twist to the story.  Very riveting, and edge of your seat reading.  Excellent Book!!
B00004RE7E|4.0|I liked this movie. stuff blows up, people fight,the story stays interesting. I didn't like how some of the key players in the story were replaced. But you can't really do anything about hollywood and it's inability to see ahead

B0060ZJ74O|1.0|Let me start off by saying that this movie is AWESOME! If you are a fan of baseball and like a true underdog story, this is the movie for you.  Now, to the negative. . . I bought this in hopes that I would be able to download the Digital Copy to iTunes and have it on my iPad for my flight next week - low and behold 'Digital Copy' is code for - there's not actually a disk inside, but you can have it in the \\"cloud\\". Which also means you need internet to watch it. Every other digital copy that I own has a disk, you put the disk in your computer and enter the code in your iTunes enabling you to put it on your iDevices. . . But nope, apparently Sony and Columbia are too good for that! So if you are just looking to put this on an iPad, iPod, iPhone or whatnot, just buy it on iTunes.  I also selected the version of this with the BluRay, DVD and \\"Digital Copy\\" but when I opened it tonight, I was greeted by a BluRay box. . . So basically I got ripped off twice, lovely.  All in all, this movie is still great, hoping that I can change this rating to 5 stars once I can get everything sorted out.

B004I8WD6E|4.0|It's more of a feminine case is my only gripe with it.  The swirls are what I am referring to. It does offer good protection but I do not like how the case bulks up the otherwise slender phone. The black one would have been more my speed. I do like the case but the flaws I feel are enough to knock it down a star. I also felt that amazon not including a back clear protector for the back glass was a little cheap.
B003X5UDEW|5.0|It is difficult to provide a unique experience in a martial arts film.  At times it seems as though we've already seen all the moves in typical over-stylized filming techniques.  The martial arts displayed in this film are refreshing, inspiring, and stay true to Kung-Fu.  The direction and filming let the viewer stay focused on the actions and the moves and made me feel like I did watching Kung-Fu as a kid - like I could do it all myself (and usually spent the day trying).
B005DTEUAE|4.0|Superb sound when played on vinyl. I managed to get a very 'organic' sound from this pressing, all the instruments (Chad's drums, Flea's bass-lines and Josh's axe-work) sound very 'real' in my living room. Kiedis' vocals added an extra punch; thanks to the fab production work of R Rubin.<br />I played the CD version of this album and it cannot compare with the depth and breath of sound I get from the vinyl LP.<br />(In case you were wondering, I play my records on a Pro-Ject turn-table, Audiolab pre-amp with dual-blocks and Mission ex800 speakers)

B000ION23A|5.0|My grandsons are both autistic, and fast paced movies usually keep their attention better than the rest.  For some reason, Ant Bully has captivated my little audience and as many times as they have seen it, they want to see it more and more.  The story is about a little boy who is bullied by the \\"big kid\\" in the neighborhood and after he is picked on, he turns his anger towards the ants in the yard.  The ants wind up teaching him that he can do anything he wants to do, and being small makes no difference.  My older grandson loves the part where he finds out what he is eating, and what he thought was a feast, is actually the remains of what a caterpillar has eaten for breakfast. He also enjoys grandma losing her teeth, and he looks at me after she drops her teeth in the drain and in the yard every time.  We both laugh because he knows that it can happen to me too.  Its a fun story for all, including grandma.  The cast is: Julia Roberts as Hova; Nicolas Cage as Zoc; Meryl Streep as Queen; Paul Giamatti as Stan Beals and Zack Tyler as Lucas Nickle (Peanut).  Lily Tomlin is Mommo (Grandma).  The story was written by John A. Davis and John Nickle and directed by John A. Davis.

I can only hope the special we saw is included as an extra feature because it really opened my eyes up to the music of Motown and it's effect on the whole country if not the world.
B00008BXJG|3.0|What is the quaility of the REMASTERING???????? Does anyone really need these long winded reviews of old school killer albums? You either like it or you don't. If the album has been remastered, i would be more interested in the quaility of the remastering than of anyones opinion of the albums, as if we have all lived under a rock for the past 30 ys. Three stars because who knows the quailty difference from the original.

B000I9WWHW|5.0|I saw this film in the theatre when it was first out, so my review is of the film and not the format (DVD, etc...)  If you ever get a chance to see this on a theatre screen, definitely go!  I had no real idea what I was in for with this film, but it is probably the most visually stunning film I've ever seen.  If you like art you will love this film just for the gorgeous art references.  It's unbelievably beautiful at times and darkly frightening at others.  The story is truly heartbreaking, but worth the journey.  All in all a cathartic experience (and isn't that one of the great outcomes of a fine film?) I don't know if I will ever watch this a second time, especially on a small screen (you know how everyone else loves your sunset photos but you can't bear to look at them because the real thing was so much more amazing and you don't want to ruin your memories?), but it's stayed with me all these years and I'm so glad I've seen it.  Although it is absolutely nothing like this in storyline, another film that feels similar to me in it's reality twisting creativity is The Time Bandits.  If you like The Time Bandits, or The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (huh, another Robin Williams film), you might want to give this a try.

B005HSG3U6|5.0|This case is wonderful!!  It does not make the Kindle Fire heavy or bulky, and it still fits directly in my side/back pocket.  The Fire fits snugly within the casing, and the interior soft padding is great for the screen.  Some of my friends got other Fire cases, but they were way too bulky.  This case is sleek and stylish!  No gimmicks.  Thumbs up dude.

0446563048|4.0|As a disclosure, I am not a Zappos customer.  Going into this, I had read about Zappos culture from business magazines and knew it was something different from conventional business culture.  I tend to favor books written by their founder.  They offer terrific insight into what drives them to create successful businesses that hopefully the reader can take away.  On that end, this book does not disappoint and really does inspire you to take a different look at running a company.  The title of this book also suggests that the culture at Zappos is driven by the theme of delivering happiness.  I would have liked to have it emphasize the warehouse logistics and technology of delivering shoes and that would have been more of an interesting read for me personally.  But in the end, it drives the point home that this is a company built on keeping customers happy and keeping employees happy.  The book chronicles the author's journey from school to founding his first company, Link Exchange, to a brief stint as a venture capitalist which led to discovering, investing, saving and ultimately selling Zappos to Amazon.  In that process, the book also goes through the author's ethos of profit, passion and purpose at Zappos.  Zappos was initially started by Nick who called his site ShoeSite before renaming it Zappos and brought in Fred as a Co-Founder.  The author's role at Zappos transformed from a stay out of the way angel investor to a hands-on, risk the house in order to save the company journey that at times was a month or two from running out of money and closing its doors.  One thing that should not escape the reader is that Zappos was started at the height of the dot come boom, survived the dot come crash, and come to survive the 2008 financial crisis, which says a lot about what good customer service can accomplish and the author's leadership.  Some minor parting points I would have liked to have read about, not to take away from an otherwise well written book  1.  I would have liked to read more on Nick's role (eventually he parted ways)  2.  Liked to have learn more about WHSKY, the system that ran the Kentucky warehouse  3.  I think if Zappos had gotten into books, they would have been a formidable competitor to Amazon.
1451627289|5.0|Stephen King may be the greatest living pure story teller in existence today.  I've read almost all of his work, and while there are instances that I didn't particularly enjoy, the writing was still engaging and the underlying story still masterfully presented.  And talk about prolific!  When King decides to write a book (which he frequently does), he doesn't automatically crank out 250-300 page money printers.  Generally, you get your money's worth with King, as in this 900 page door stop (though, admittedly, the spacing and type actually justify about 700 pages; still a healthy tome).<br /><br />Most commonly known for his horror stories, this effort demonstrates King's range; because, at his heart, he is a pure storyteller, regardless of the genre.  King could write science fiction or romance and be equally adept at captivating his audience with his ability to spin a yarn.  I've opined in the past on my preference for his efforts that seek to enter the human mind and demonstrate the horror in each of us.  He does this by creating realistic circumstances that we can all relate to, and demonstrating how terrifying events can ensue.  He does this without resort to corporeal beings that have become increasingly silly and absurd over time.  After all, isn't reality so much more potentially horrifying than the \\"over the top\\", stupid happenings in so many of King's works?<br /><br />Duma Key is a perfect example.  The first two-thirds of the book are a fine example of King's ability to get inside the head of a damaged human being and write masterfully.  The final third of the book is simply too bizarre for words and, in my opinion, ruined what could have been an excellent book.  The Gunslinger books are just unreadable (at least to me).  Even in books such as The Dome, with unbelievable and impossible sets of events, King's ability to examine the working of the human mind (especially in those that happen to be defective) is what sets him apart from his contemporaries.<br /><br />While this novel certainly has aspects of horror (the type I prefer), it is essentially a time travel story, with all of the questions and complexities inherent in such an effort.  Our protagonist is introduced to a time portal and urged to make use of it for the purpose of preventing the Kennedy assassination.  What follows is pure entertainment.  This is one of the best King novels I've read in quite some time.tainly has aspects of horror (the type I prefer), it is essentially a time travel story, with all of the questions and complexities inherent in such an effort.

However this book really surprised me and made me want to finish the series.<br /><br />The book has some nice twists and turns that I wasn't expecting. A book that really made it hard to put down. Looking forward to the final book now.

B005N1E8A4|5.0|Being primarily a rocker and nowadays a blues enthusiast, it is hard to believe that this is my 7th title from Kylie. Yes, what a contradiction it is. Just look for all my reviews and you'll know exactly what I mean. To make my explanation short, the reason is this: I only have space in my heart for ONE \\"Pop Princess\\". Kylie Minogue, with her beautiful smile (and everything else, from all the \\"happy and loveable\\" lyrics to her incredible \\"sweet and hot\\" personna), caught me quite easily with the \\"Live In Sidney\\" DVD. Since then, I \\"couldn't get her out of my head\\". About the DVD, the image quality (both 2D and 3D versions) is far better than the last one, in fact, it is close to perfection. Brazilian fans will be excited by some shots of our nation's flag, showed many times during the whole concert. Great collection of hits and amazing performances, not to mention the extravagant but wonderful stage. Nothing to be added concerning the 3D version, simply because I don't have this kind of equipment at home. Maybe I never will, because nothing compares to the excitement and joy you feel in a live show. Real music lovers go to concert halls and arenas, they pay tickets (in Brazil tickets are ridiculously expensive!) to see the artists they love. DVD's are a good way to relive an experience, but they can never replace them!

B005D0RDKW|5.0|The meaning of \\"power trio\\" is this: RUSH. A long time ago, some decades to be precise, I discovered this band. How could only three skinny guys from Canada play so loud? As mentioned by Jack Black in the documentary \\"Rush: Beyond The Lighted Stage\\" released in 2010, the opening track of that first album is a killer song. And I agree. As for this concert, which I had the chance to experience when they came to Sao Paulo, Brazil, it is espectacular! Professionalism taken to the extreme level, with a generous amount of light and sound! Experience the RUSH hour. Better, make it almost three hours and be delighted. This DVD is a must buy.

B002I0J5FG|5.0|Wow I just finished reading those 1 star reviews and I am appalled at those comments on two amazing games.  I had never played either of these games on the PS2 and my first taste of them was on the PS3 in 3D HD and I can say WOW. Ico is clearly an older game but it's influence can be seen on many modern titles (for example Uncharted's platforming clearly took a few notes from this game). In 3D Ico is a very nice looking game and the gameplay mechanics are solid. As for the water wheel it's not that bad, it took me all of 3 tries to get past it so I'm a little shocked that people can make it that far in the game and not be able to pass it.  Graphics/story/music/everything in this game is great BUT it's Shadows of the Colossus that the PS3 really makes a difference in. SotC looks AMAZING in 3D in rivaling Avatar's graphics. The scenery is simply stunning and the colossi look beautifully fearsome. I was in awe killing my first 3 colossi in 3D, truly a unique experience. One thing I will say about SotC is that the controls don't seem as solid as they were in Ico, but still everything else more than makes up for it. These games aren't just art, they're fun games with great stories. Buy this HD collection, play it (in 3D if possible), and enjoy every second of them.
0802130208|3.0|This book was ok but I would never read it again. The main character Agnatius was THE MOST infuriating character I have ever had to deal with. I hoped he would learn a lesson at the end of the book but nope didnt happen. At least it tied together well wich is a plus and It was a page turner only because I so desperately wanted the main character to change his arrogant ways which never happened. I highly suggest this authors first book though NEON BIBLE that is a 5/5 for sure and quite different.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|What a wasted build up of 2 great books. I guess the author had a dead line or started another project should had stopped at 2
B006WWP5KA|5.0|I am a vampire movie/television show buff, and I'm happy to find that this latest teen drama has a fresh twist on the old tale.  Clearly, there is some Whedon influence to Vampire Diaries, but it is new and clean not the same old teenage angst--lonely misery-filled vampire show. I recommend it for those looking for a bit of a twist on the old.
B004SIP8W0|4.0|This violently divided critics, some of whom saw it as a masterpiece of humanity, and others who saw it as trivializing the holocaust.  I’m with those in the middle.  There’s a lot that’s enjoyable and touching, and a certain amount that’s too cute for the circumstance, or that screws up logic.<br /><br />I like the idea that Benigni tries to protect his child’s innocence by convincing him that the concentration camp their in is some kind of psychotic summer camp.  And when the convention works it’s very powerful. But when it gets hard to believe (as when the Nazi’s fail to discover the boy over a long period of time) it takes a lot of the power out of it’s punch.  Still, some of the comic moments in the film’s first half are gems, and while the dark 2nd half doesn’t all work, it certainly gets points for trying.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It works just I expected it to.  Nothing fancy but it works great. I can kill a lot of time with this classic game.

Get your ego in check before you read The Power of Now, because if you're not ready for it, his words can blow you away.  With that said, I found myself consistently asking myself, where is the tenderness? Where is the mothering love?

1451648537|4.0|The constant refrain through the book is the exceptional insight and force of Steve Jobs to make things happen according to his direction and boundaries, along with the obnoxious behavior that accompanied that life. On both fronts, he had few peers. The incidents of horrible behavior sure piled up. If the author had taken it easy on the latter, the book would not have worked, and this reader is grateful for the cooperation of Jobs himself. For a man whose work output was so public, his private life was indeed highly private and Isaacson was able to get behind the curtain enough to make the book work effectively.  Was the author too favorable on the vision, uniqueness and quality of Apple's products and Jobs' own role? That has already been debated extensively and will continue to be. To me, it doesn't matter that much, and opinion can be filtered. The better part is the story behind some of the decision making, and I would willingly have accepted more.  As a businessman, instead of a product visionary, the Pixar story may actually have been more impressive than that of Jobs the Apple CEO. Much of Apple's success as a company, such as the manufacturing engine in China and all the back-office stuff, followed Jobs' lead, but required exceptional talent of senior management and others. With Pixar, in what is almost an extended sidebar starring Jobs and John Lasseter, the story of its near-death (multiple times) and the path to billions is probably less known and has a fascination of its own. As with Apple, an \\"A team\\" of critical players (here, the brilliant animators and story tellers who finally persuaded Jobs that Pixar's future was animation, not products) was likely the difference between success and failure or an average existence.  The cast of characters from Apple and the industry is broad and interesting, in the cameos to more extended roles. Isaacson rightly gets credit for the notable exchanges regarding Jobs and Bill Gates, as one example. The well-known love/hate saga of relationships between Jobs and others must appear for at least a a couple dozen people discussed here alone.  The book is not rich on product details or how large companies run. This certainly differs from what a detailed bio on Gates would have to cover. Given that Isaacson is not a technical person, and the person and product drama would resonate with a larger audience, he appears to have made the right choice.  The book is a must for people in the field, and the fanboys, too.
B001B1UO6W|3.0|This product arrived as promised, as a matter of fact it arrived early. THis product was just as I remembered the DVD was just fine. thank you!
1451648537|5.0|Apple Computer's founder Steve Jobs astounded the world with his creative vision and confounded people with his mercurial, often cruel personality. Best-selling biographer and media insider Walter Isaacson synthesizes the conflicting aspects, rooted deep within Jobs's psyche, of a man whose harsh and relentless demand for perfection at times threatened to overshadow his genius. Written at Jobs's request soon after his cancer diagnosis - but without his control or final say - Isaacson's book thoroughly dissects the Apple founder's life through extensive interviews and research. getAbstract recommends this definitive biography of a complicated, creative and ultimately world-changing persona.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I had to buy the completed set. my kids grew up with Harry and his stories. I wanted to have a complete series in one format, for future viewing.

B004MC8CA2|4.0|If you're just looking for a basic Bible, with a reading plan, this will do it. I like that i can access several versions for free as long as I have a wifi connection. But for serious study, you'll need to spend a little cash on an app with more options. I'd like to see multiple views, allowing me to compare versions or see my bookmarks or notes without having to return to home. Too many taps required to move around the text, and you get only one chapter per &quot;page&quot; so you have to reload the previous chapter if you want to go back. But, its free, and apps for Kindle are still pretty limited. For now, I'll leave serious study to my laptop, iphone, or just do it the old-fashioned way.
0525478817|5.0|The book is outstanding. This is the first of Green's books I have read, and the first fiction novel I have finished since reading Harry Potter in high school (I'm now through undergrad and bouncing through the job market). The book's very relatable and likable characters take you on a very fun ride with laughs, deep thought, and pain. The book is an easy read, with an occasional wild card word that only requires a quick dictionary look-up and reread. This all made the book hard to put down, and I finished it in one sitting. It was definitely good enough to read again, something I do not really ever do, and it has reintroduced me to the joy of reading. Thank you, John Green. -Brian

0312641893|5.0|She was a cyborg, and she would never go to a ball.<br /><br />Cinder by Marissa Meyer is one outrageously amazing book! If you haven't read it yet, get on it. LIKE. RIGHT NOW. It's funny, touching, thought-provoking, fiercely compelling and insanely heartbreaking. Ridiculously well-written, taut, original, deeply emotional and gorgeously mesmerizing, it's the definition of a page-turner.<br /><br />  Linh Cinder is a cyborg, which of course means some of her body parts have been replaced with mechanical ones. It also means, she's a second-class citizen and she is treated as such. She lives with her \\"adopted family\\" in New Beijing, in the Eastern Commonwealth, and has to earn her keep working as a full-service mechanic at the Beijing's weekly market. The Earth's population, ravaged by Letumosis, was driven to the brink of extinction. No one knows the cause of this worldwide pandemic that already killed thousands of people. No one knows how to cure it, either.<br /><br />  Letumosis is not the only thing that Prince Kai has to worry about, though. There is also the threat of war against the Lunar (Moon) Empire hanging over the nation (no pun intended!). The evil Queen Levana has long been lusting over the blue planet. She wants Earth for herself, and she always gets everything she wants. She's powerful. She can manipulate the bioelectricity of people around her, casting a sort of glamour, making them see and feel whatever she chooses. She's despicable and ruthless, yet people can't resist her \\"charm\\". She's ugly and disgusting, yet all that others can see is a beautiful, trust-worthy, angel-like woman. And they follow her. And now she wants Prince Kai and Earth, and she's tired of waiting and negotiating.<br /><br />  Cinder's world is flipped inside-out when her beloved little sister, Peony, falls ill and is taken away to die in isolation. Her grief-stricken step-mother blames Cinder for her daughter's sickness. She sends Cinder away, volunteering her as a test subject for plague testing. But that's just the beginning of her problems. What she's about to discover will change not only her life, but also the lives of everyone around her, possibly the whole planet.<br /><br />  This book left me speechless.<br />When I first started reading, I was, like, \\"So OK, it looks like just another re-telling of the classic fairy tale with a futuristic cyborg twist\\". I was intrigued (I have a THING for anything clockwork), but not entirely sold yet. The first 20-30 pages is like that. The beginning of the story was great, but with Prince Kai visiting Cinder's mechanical shop, and then Cinder  day-dreaming about His Hotness, it didn't have the air of uniqueness about it. Not until Peony got sick. That's exactly when - forgive my French - sh** hits the fan (trust me, it's a very accurate description of how things go really bad from this moment onward). From that point in the story EVERYTHING you thought you knew about Cinderella is re-defined and re-envisioned. For the most part it still follows the simple set up of the original tale, but Meyer adds some seriously insane depth to it. She builds around it, gracefully weaving all the fascinating futuristic details and extraterrestrial elements into the plot, creating a complex, impressive, fantastically imagined world. It's mind-blowing.<br /><br />  Marissa Meyer created a truly unforgettable world. Her writing style is amazingly descriptive and enjoyable. She has such a fabulous imagination (and is not afraid to use it!). I can easily picture New Beijing in my head. I think the setting of the story couldn't be any more perfect. On top of the fabulous world-building there's also the savvy plot line. It's a mesmerizing blend of steampunk, fairy tale AND mystery. Some plot developments are easy to predict, but mostly you're just sitting there with your jaw on your knees and eyes bulging out in surprise. And even if you could predict everything that will happen, you'd still love reading about it- it's a real crowd-pleaser in terms of its readability.<br /><br />  I loved the characters. To say that they had more depth than the characters from the original fairy tale would be a major understatement. For once it's not about the silly ball, dancing with the shallow Prince or running away in a carriage made of pumpkin! The characters are real, their emotions are real, they have real problems, fears, struggles. There is a ball, but it's not the kind of ball you imagine when you think of Cinderella. There's a mechanical foot instead of a glass slipper and the dress is not only wrinkled, grease-stained and not in the least magical, but there is also a profound meaning to it. The Prince is not a brain-dead, spoiled little master with personality deficiency, who fancy sumptuous balls. He's an intelligent, good-hearted young man, who finds himself caught between duty and love. He has some insanely difficult decisions to make, and choosing a bride for himself is the least of his problems. Even the wicked step-mother is not entirely rid of human feelings. As much as I disliked her, she did have a few genuinely heart-breaking moments, when you could see a whole different layer of emotions shining through. My favorite character, though, was Cinder's adorable android friend, Iko. She was ROTFL-worthy, witty, supportive, loyal and just so.. cute! Her hilarious comments made for fantastic tension breakers. I really hope to see more of Iko in the next book of the Lunar Chronicles! Oh, and let's not forget about Queen Levana! Oh lord, what a gorgeously evil character she is! The White Witch and the Snow Queen combined wouldn't stand a chance! The whole concept of the Lunar Kingdom and the long lost Princess Selene reminded me of Sailor Moon - how could it not?! There are of course some major differences, but I'm fairly confident that Naoko Takeuchi's greatly enjoyable manga series inspired this breath-taking YA debut novel in some ways. And I LOVED IT!<br /><br />  To sum it all up: Cinder by Marissa Meyer is one helluva book! It's only the beginning of 2012 and yet I'm 100% sure this book will make it to my TOP 10 of 2012 list. I can't wait to learn more about Queen Levana and the mysterious Lunar Kingdom, and find out what will happen to Cinder, Nainsi and Prince Kai. I strongly recommend this read to everyone!!!oved the characters. To say that they had more depth than the characters from the original fairy tale would be a major understatement.

To sum it all up: Cinder by Marissa Meyer is one helluva book! It's only the beginning of 2012 and yet I'm 100% sure this book will make it to my TOP 10 of 2012 list. I can't wait to learn more about Queen Levana and the mysterious Lunar Kingdom, and find out what will happen to Cinder, Nainsi and Prince Kai. I strongly recommend this read to everyone!!!
1451627289|3.0|I had no interest in reading this book - this is, until I discovered that it had beaten out my favorite book of the year (Ready Player One) in the Sci-Fi category for the 2011 GoodReads Choice Awards on GoodReads.com .  Then I started reading some reviews and thought I'd check out what all the hubbub was about.  I find this a difficult book to review, because on the one hand, the topic of time travel has been waaaay overdone.  And the topic of JFK had also been waaay overdone - many times over in fact.  But, the book itself was still a nice treat, in a lot of ways.  But, how do you prove to prospective book buyers that this is new and exciting fiction to read?  It's not.  Only Stephen King can make a book with a concept like this go somewhere.  It didn't go far, but it entertains.  Some reviews praised the book as a love story.  Okay...sure, but \\"Somewhere in Time\\" or \\"The Time Traveller's Wife\\" it's not.  Even as pure romance, there was a lot missing - and very poorly written sex scenes (especially when dealing with a virgin...c'mon...obviously from a man's ignorant perspective)!  No matter how good a writer Mr. King is, there was no saving those areas of the book.  But, Jake is a likable character - and so is Sadie.  I liked them together as a couple.  I liked reading about them dancing (and dancing plays a key role in this book - probably one of the biggest ones, which I thought was unique and sweet).  Some reviews praised the book as a good time travel story.  Maybe.  But, why pick the late 50s?  Why have Jake betting on sports?  Isn't that EXACTLY what was already done in Back to the Future?  Al = Doc Brown and Jake = Marty.  Yawwwwn!!!  And `The Butterfly Effect'??? Ummm...that's been done, too.  Give me something NEW to do with time travel, puleeeze!  When I read the Time Traveller's Wife, it blew my mind - it was an exciting take on time travel!!!  This seemed like manufactured time travel junk.  Sure, there were a few mysteries (JIMLA!) and interesting revelations at the end, but nothing as satisfying as I'd hoped to turn me around.  I enjoyed the ending.  Some reviews praised the 1950s-60s references.  Yes - these were well done.  I enjoyed reading the first 1/3 of the book which described a lot of the lifestyle in that era - how easy some things were (like, a degree from Oklahoma University by writing one easy multiple choice test) and how difficult others were (like, just getting around town without GPS!).  Some reviews praised the JFK assassination research.  Okay...sure, lots of good research and assumptions, but this was all boring as heck.  Lots of it I already knew, and the stuff I didn't, and most I found to be repetitive drivel.  I literally skipped every scene in the book that Oswald was in.  Didn't care, and it didn't make a difference.  Could've shaved off about 300 pages!  Really, the `event in history' to go back in time to change, could have been a lot of monumental moments in history.  Why did King pick this one?  King mentioned that he started to write this book back in the early 70s.  Too bad he didn't.  I think it would have been a better story back then (pre-Back to the Future, et al).

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have never read a Stephen King novel before and I was intrigued to read this book. While the premise of this books starts with Jake Epping going back in time to the late 50's to live in the past and ultimately stop the assassination of JFK, it really is about the journey and not the destination. I fell in love with Jake he was the most realistic character I've ever encountered. I got lost in the time period and the love story that this journey became. There were times in this book where my heart was literally pounding as I was reading! Needless to say, I LOVED LOVED LOVED this book and I ended up in tears at the end. Such beautiful prose!  The first 5 chapters where a struggle for me and I couldn't quite get a sense of what was going on. But it's worth the read because it sets up the entire novel. If you are looking for a book about JFK conspiracy theories than this isn't the book for you.  I've noticed a lot of the \\"baby boomer\\" generation being disappointed in this book. I'm assuming they were looking for something that would tell the world what it would be like if JFK had lived. That isn't what this is about and you shouldn't expect it. King isn't trying to solve anything, he is trying to tell a story about what it might be like to try and  change the future and what the repercussions might be if done.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think this game is for kids. because instead of buying a lot games , you can buy this game because there's 101+16 games.
0192853619|5.0|I have several friends who ask about good math books. For more sophisticated folks, I recommend Journey through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics but for most, Gower's book is the one I suggest by far the most.  (BTW: Check out his blog and naturally the Companion).  Why?  The two difficulties most non-mathy folks have are infinity (that there are many) and high dimensionality.  Gowers in particular does a superb job of leading one through the understanding of a 5D \\"unit cube\\", using cartesian 5-tuple (list of 5 numbers) to discover the properties of the cube.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great mix of easy and challenging games. Very fun!  My whole family loves to play. I highly recommend this game to everyone.

B005QUQP76|5.0|Found this mouse on sale at the local store, and decided to look it up here because I had not heard about it before.  Based on the reviews written so far, I decided to pick it up.  After opening the package, I was stunned at how good it looked.  The Aluminum panel at the bottom folded into a frame, looked industrial grade.  The textured and contoured surface where the thumb rests made it easy to keep a steady grip on the device, while the ultra smooth glide pads made it fly around the newly bought cloth mouse pad with the slightest of efforts.  The three sensitivity presets were very easy to switch between, and the middle setting at the default 2400 dpi has struck the perfect balance between speed and control for now.  The 5700 dpi setting seemed very fast indeed, and the 800 dpi setting was still usable because of how easily this glided.  The software was not included, but easy to find on corsair's website.  Unfortunately it provided almost no real documentation about the settings.  I could figure out many of the things, but I am not sure about settings like lift height, macros, and the many different options this seems to have.  Would have been nice if a full manual was available so I could use it properly.  I also found an error in the on screen button labeling, reversing the forward and back buttons from their normal positions.  I think this part of the support needs to mature a bit more. Despite that shortcoming, I am sure that I made the right decision in picking this up over Logitech or Razor.  Those are good products too, but I couldn't pass this one up at the price on sale.
B004EBZX6W|1.0|Got this as a free app of the day and it worked great. Several weeks later didn't work at all. Uninstalled and tried to download from the cloud to my Kindle Fire and it simply won't.  Has become useless. Glad it was free.
B004XDYJRU|2.0|I like the accessibility and the option to record. I have found some really great stations. HOWEVER, it cuts out CONSTANTLY!  Like all the time. I'll just get into the song or the story on the morning show, it cuts out and takes 5 or more seconds. which is a long time when you miss the punch line. PLEASE PLEAS FIX THIS BUFFERING, CUT OUT ISSUE. I WILL GIVE 5 STARS AND TELL EVERYONE TO GET THIS APP!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like it but a couple of the games are janky. its really entertaining though. I play it all the time to get enough points to move on.
B006IVBSBU|2.0|I thought after watching the previews it looked action packed.  Unfortunately it was slow.  Matt Damons acting was disappointing compared to The Bourne Identity which was great.

B006YLGDQE|5.0|What a wonderful work of art.  The best of Public  TV.<br />We all think we are in a time of rapid change now, but imagine that English society was like it was in 1913 for 300 years before that time.<br />World War I ripped apart the entire fabric of the English society. 50 million dead from  the War and influenza. The Chauffeur marrying a Lady from the family he worked for? Unthinkable!<br />This series in on a par with \\"Upstairs - Downstairs\\"<br />Cannot recommend it enough. Suggest you buy and watch the entire first series as it will make the second series so much better.

B00457WZEI|5.0|I don't know what version the three reviewers that gave one star for this book were reading. Granted, I read it quickly because War Horse IS a page turner, but I do not remember the Lord's name taken in vain and felt that it was a wonderful book for young AND old readers. It reminds me of \\"Black Beauty\\" and \\"Beautiful Joe\\", books that I loved as a child that were told through the eyes of the animal. I'm with the other 149 reviewers that gave War Horse 5 stars. There was nothing that I didn't like about it and it teaches a lot of lessons to the younger readers. Some of which could be used as refreshers for us older ones about how to treat animals.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I find it very useful for notes, to-do lists, shopping lists, etc. Sketch add-on is also useful and powerful. I use Evernote on my Android phone, MacBook Pro and Kindle Fire.

B006ISJQ26|3.0|\\"If I fell in love with you in the countryside, what would you do about<br />it.\\" Mitchel (Farrell) has just got out of jail and wants to stay<br />straight. He gets a job as a bodyguard for a reclusive actress<br />Charlotte (Knightley). When a friend of his introduces him to London's<br />Don things go badly for Mitch and he is now stuck between going back to<br />his old life or trying to keep the new one. Going in I saw Colin<br />Farrell, writer of the \\"DEPARTED\\" and another mob type movie. I was<br />excited. I started watching...the longer it went on the more<br />disappointed I got. This is a very neat idea but didn't know if it<br />wanted to be a action movie or a love story. It seemed that the action<br />aspect was good but then slowed done when Knightly showed up. I realize<br />that that is the characters dilemma and is needed to show his choice,<br />but the movie didn't feel smooth. This could just be me but I love mob<br />movies but this one didn't feel like one at all. Very artsy, so be<br />prepared. Overall, not what I expected which is why I think I didn't<br />like it that much. Too slow for me. I give it a C.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|great fun and is a great thing to pass the time will keep you busy long and wont be good enough to miss what your waiting for (:
B0068MNO4S|4.0|\\"The most performed playwright of all time, the author of 37 plays, 154 sonnets & several narrative poems...and yet not a single manuscript of any kind has ever been found written in Shakespeare's own hand.\\" A movie that explores the theory that Shakespeare didn't write any of the things that he is said to. The theory is that The Earl of Oxford (Ifans) wrote them all as a stab at the new Queen (Redgrave) of England. I have said this before but I am not a Shakespeare fan at all, I just don't get him. There are a few movies of his I like but for the most part I am not a fan. Needless to say before watching this I was not that excited at all. Almost instantly the movie grabbed me and I was hooked. For those like me this is not really about Shakespeare at all, but more of a political thriller about trying to start and control a rebellion against Queen Elizabeth I in the 1600's. Weather this is true or not to me doesn't matter but the idea of writing plays as a way to begin a rebellion is a very interesting theory and makes for a very interesting movie. Overall, (from a non-Shakespeare fan) I really enjoyed this movie and recommend this. I give it a B+.
B006CBSE86|2.0|Let me say this: Nightwish is one of my favorite bands, and is the group that introduced me to this wonderful genre; I've been waiting for this release with hope and excited anticipation since shortly after Dark Passion Play.  When it finally came out and I was able to sate my longing, I must say: I found myself heavily disappointed.  I found this extra-saddening after Anette's spectacular performance in DPP.  It's simply not very good.  It still has a few good tracks (I do enjoy Storytime, Turn the Mermaids Loose, and Last Ride of the Day), but the songs I remember being hyped up and spoken about pre-release (Scaretale especially) were, frankly, awful.  A good quarter of the album was deleted from my WMP (hush) library within a day of purchase.  My fingers are crossed for a better release next album.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|Good quality/features for reasonable price. Good product protection, snug fit on Fire, good plastic case with corner impact guards, lightweight flexible cover. Elastic cover band is nice feature, keeps screen protected.
B003BLXKK2|1.0|The story was boring and draggy.  A cheap ripoff of better, stylish action films of the past.  The Julie Benz character annoyed me from the moment she entered the movie.  Then some fat guy in a speedo for what seemed like 30 minutes.  I had to shut it off.  Nothing interesting or original here.  Was never a fan of Boondocks 1 either.  These movies also run way too long.
B00006878K|5.0|If your a blues/rock fan and you don't have this, there's something wrong with you. Get it now [!!]? Heard this as a kid and can't imagine life without the best blues available.
B00005LLK8|3.0|I have a copy of the original Billy Elliott in VHS Tape and loved it. I ordered the compact disk over a year ago and didn't watch it due to a move. I was shocked when I watched the CD recently as it has been edited and ruined in my estimation. Some of the raw street language is removed, which showed the contrast between the hardworking rough side of Billy's background and his love of dance.  The relationship between Billy's neighborhood friend was edited making it a very minor friendship which was not in the original.  All along the film I noticed minor changes that took the strong appealing part of the story away.  At the end when Billy's old friend from the neighborhood shows up at Billy's ballet debut dressed in \\"drag\\" with his obviously homosexual partner was completely omitted.  I thought it removed an important statement that Billy, who was ridiculed by family and some friends, as being effeminate just because he loved dancing, yet his macho friend from the neighbor turned out to be gay.  It ruined the whole story for me that I feel were important parts of the story and I think whoever is responsible made a really good story into a bland flop.
0525423656|3.0|I was a big fan of Matched and very excited to read the sequel, but unfortunately it didn't send me the way Matched did. Matched was a beautifully written love story set in a compelling and believable future society. Ky and Cassia began a forbidden relationship after Cassia had been matched to someone else, and Ky's knowledge of what the Society was really doing in the Outer Provinces shattered Cassia's long-held beliefs. At the end of the story, Ky and Cassia were ripped apart, and the reader along with them.<br /><br />So Crossed follows our couple separately as they try to find their way back to each other, and I have some issues. Telling a story from two characters' alternating first-person POVs is tricky, because you have to work extra hard once those two characters meet up in the story to keep their voices distinct. That didn't happen here, and I was constantly going back to the chapter pages to remind myself whose head I was in. I also felt like the Society got a major re-working in this story and I was confused. A lot of new facets were introduced and I really couldn't get a grasp on what was going on. Some secrets were revealed about Ky and Xander (Cassia's best friend and official match), and hints were dropped at even bigger revelations to come, and I can't say I'm really happy with the direction that's going in. Cassia was also way too wishy-washy about choosing between those boys after everything that happened.<br /><br />Still a fast-paced and exciting read, but not what I was really expecting, and after reading this I have no idea what to expect from the final installment.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I -&lt;3 it very much!! I play it @ school when I get bored lol :) ha ha ha its a cool game to play. I stay up tell mid-night playing it once

B005NF2UE6|5.0|Here and Now is a fabulous new album from Nickelback and it shows the band's progression from earlier albums, as the band has grown from a young, hungry band into rock superstars. Nickelback does what they do best.... pulls together soft anthems, hard rock and catchy toe-tappers, and amazingly makes it all work together. Buy the album. And, if you have never seen Nicklelback live on tour, then you haven't lived.
B0050PYNOY|1.0|I've never had a problem with gay movies going as far back as \\"Norman, Is That You?\\" in the 1970s. You can couch just about anything in comedy and produce some good laughs.  But this movie failed. If the director saw an opportunity to insert homosexuality into a scene, he did and without any subtlety and many scenes were contrived simply to introduce homosexuality as good, funny, wonderful, etc. Sure, some of the homosexual scenes were amusing, but anyone who knows about conditioning should know in the first couple of minutes that the director is pushing his \\"gay is good comedy\\" agenda.  I don't altogether mind that, but the homosexuality is then mixed liberally with bestiality and a very massive dose of incest. Even homosexual incest. Parental incest.  Yes, incest. You want an \\"incest is great and funny\\" message in your movie? Here it is.  People can make \\"oh come on\\" excuses and give the movie a pass because it drew some laughs, but like I said before, a director can present any kind of scene and get laughs. Rape? Laughs. Child molestation? Laugh. Snuff? Laugh. Just because a director can draw some chuckles doesn't make those things \\"cool and comfortable\\" because we can laugh at them.  Well, INCEST is now all \\"cool.\\"  INCEST, BESTIALITY, and so much HOMOSEXUALITY in this movie you wonder why they bothered with Natalie and Zooey. The two nice-looking ladies probably were only included for the trailers to draw in as many paying customers for this revolting message as possible.  What a waste.  By the way, if you are hoping this is  \\"pot comedy\\" due to the title, one actor puffs a pipe and squints his eyes for about two seconds. Pot smokers will find nothing in this movie attractive. Just a lot of incest, homosexuality, and bestiality. But hey, it all cool!

B005K17RU0|4.0|I like the app and the fact that you can have multiple saved locations but the one feature it needs is hourly forecasts.
B004LUS390|5.0|I started out with the Sketchbook Express, or the lite version. I was blown away, even though it wasn't the full, even though I couldn't save my art, and it was amazing! Now that I'm in possession of the full, I can't deny I'm in a mobile artist's heaven. No more carrying around paints, pencils, pads of paper, and the other tools that could end up being mess, breakable, and expensive; just my kindle fire. I recommend this 100%!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I found this book to be awesome. I was worried that I would not like it at first, but it is a true page turner. The characters are great and the storyline intriguing. I immediately bought the secon book as soon as I finished this one. You will love it!!

B005OK722U|4.0|when i heard that eli roth and quentin tarantino were not involved in the 3rd hostel installment, i'll admit i was skeptical.  still, curiosity got the best of me. even losing the original european setting was a bit disturbing to me. knowing a few of the standard cast (including the geeky, spooky hostel desk clerk with the harry potter glasses, the gang of orphans and even the creepy rich old guy with the dogs from the 2nd movie) were going to be absent was not something i looked forward to. i expected a loss of a certain sense of class with the american (las vegas) setting.....but what i feared most was that this would probably turn out to be a cheap exploitation of the first 2 wonderful movies with lots of torture in a poor attempt to cover up for a lack of plot.  i am happy to say that this was NOT the case!! i'll admit that even though the 1st 2 movies have become 2 of my favorite movies, i only gave each of them only 4 stars because i think they both would've benefitted by showing more torture. this flick did not have any more torture than its predecesors...which is a bit bad in some ways, but good in the fact that they did not try to exploit and cover up as i stated above. the movie does lose a certain 'european panache' with this vegas setting, but the writer and director really made an effort to try to stay true to the [shall we say] 'integrity' or true spirit of the first 2. the plot with the diverted golf vacation-turned-bachelor party was an interesting start. they kept you guessing as to who were the good guys and who were the bad guys. the vegas setting seemed to be more set on audiences watching the victims getting tortured. i laughed when i found they were placing sick bets on aspects of the torture like when the victim would beg for mercy for the sake of his family......i mean, how cold can you get???  there was a bit where they used bugs that looked like large beetles on a girl that was kind of lame. overall, this...like the first 2 could've benefitted from a bit more torture. the vegas setting was an interesting idea that allowed for scantily clad women....occasional glimpses of topless girls, but not very much.  again, although the loss of the european backdrop pulled them into a certain loss of class, the writer and director made an effort to try to stay true to the original intent of the series. they fell a little short, but with surprises, twists and an able cast, they did a reasonable job of continuing the hostel series.  and as i said, this was not quite as good as the first 2 hostel movies, but it was a gallant try....and better than expected!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some of the games are quite entertaining. I have a little problem with the ones that require a lot of movement on the screen.
B0063IH60K|4.0|the only real issues are the hints that don't account for certain actions that would otherwise let you know you're stuck and need to deal.  the tap to snap to certain cards occaisonally snaps to the wrong cards too.
145162445X|5.0|I pre-ordered this volume long time ago. I had myself watched Krauss video on the topic and I wanted to read a complete and clear argument. It was great to receive the book a couple of days ago. I started reading on the bus and couldn't stop. This is a great summary of one of the most challenging ideas of science, that might eventually answer the fundamental question formulated in the subtitle.  This is a great reading. If you want to know something about the cutting-edge picture that is emerging from physics and cosmology concerning the origins of the universe, this is your book. If you want to hear about new ways of approaching those questions that were consider \\"philosophical\\" for centuries, this is your book. If you still believe that the old \\"answers\\" to the question provided by religion or philosophy are satisfactory, please try this too. It might change your mind.  It is really mind blowing to see that the last decades are witnessing a truly amazing \\"invasion\\" of fundamental questions by science. They are not anymore philosophy. This is now the territory of science: consciousness, the origin of life, the origins of everything... what an amazing and promising adventure!  It's great to live in this time where such a revolution is taking place.

Every aspect of the book is carefully contrived to fit the circus. The description is layered and brilliant, the characters are deep and alive, the plot is complex and subtle. It is the sort of book that looks rather plain at first blush, but then, when you glance away, seeps into your thoughts and your dreams.  The Night Circus is a rather difficult story to describe. It's about a boy and a girl, and a contest, and mostly about a circus. It's a little like The Prestige and a little like The Scorpio Races, but mostly it is like itself. This is not the sort of book that will be for everyone. It has a rather slow pace and takes longer to read than you might expect at 387 pages. There isn't a great deal of action and the voice of the story is unusual, third-person present omniscient, which basically means that you're watching rather than being the characters. In my opinion, everything about this story was perfect for this story. Anywhere else, I would probably hate it, but Morgenstern does such a wonderful job creating the atmosphere in this book that it almost seems as though there is no other way to do it.  The characters in this book were superb. Despite the odd style, I felt more connected to even the minor characters than I have to some first-person narrators. The ways they acted and interacted felt entirely real and believable. Marco and Celia especially had me biting my nails through half the book, and some of the characters had me guessing up till the very end.  If you like the styles of Guy Gavriel Kay, Maggie Stiefvater, and Audrey Niffenegger; if you like slow, subtle plots and games within games; if you like the gradual building of suspense and tension, then this is the book for you. I thought it was absolutely incredible. If you're not sure, give it a try - pretty soon you'll either love it or hate it. I love it.  \\"You think, as you walk away from Le Cirque des Rêves and into the creeping dawn, that you felt more alive within the confines of the circus.  You are no longer quite certain which side of the fence is a dream.\\"

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Being a small child when JFK was killed I remember it as the first time I saw my Dad cry and boy was I scared. So that is always etched in my mind and when I heard about this book I knew it had to be the first one I read on my new Kindle. It was the first Steven King novel I ever read as I always thought of him in the stereotype \\"horror\\" writer whose books turned into horror movies, a genre I am not a fan off. So after the first 50 pages or so I thought, man this guy can write.  I found myself literally in Derry, Maine or Jodie, Texas as the writing transported you directly to the scene and everything seemed so real that you can sense the places, the late 50's, the cars, the smoking, the dress codes. I never once found myself half reading as I was 100% absorbed. Even about 1/3 of the way through as I was thoroughly enjoying the book, I though to myself, \\"hmm it was missing a love interest\\" and sure enough, like harmonies from the book, Sadie shows up.  I admit there were many points in the book where I chocked up and that is a good thing. It means the emotional punch is being delivered. Things like the joy of teaching young kids, the way he described it through George's thoughts were very strong. The focus on dancing as a way to capture the best parts of life was uplifting and makes you recall those so few times when you did feel free to dance away your troubles. I found myself highlighting sentences on my Kindle because they resonated with me (and other readers from what I saw).  All in all this was a true 5-star book for me and hopefully it has opened up a new search for me through the stories of the famous Steven King, who I did bump into at Red Sox Spring Training in Ft. Myers Florida back in 2010 I believe. Me and my buddies were like \\"hey it is Steven King\\" and he looked over and gave us a smile. So Mr. King thank you for such a great book and glad you waited all these years to write it as it turned out near perfect.
B004JMZPJG|4.0|My Nikon D3100 fits very well in this bag with room to spare in the main compartment. Extra room is a little too much though. Main compartment is bigger than the camera with the kit lens fitted. I use some air-bags to fill the gaps and they work excellent (amazon sends air-bags in the packing and they are STRONG). The two pockets on both sides are enough to keep the charger, data cable, extra bits like lens cover etc and still there is room to spare. Strap is large enough and the bag never shows a sign of being weak. It is a strong bag and should last long.
B0067QPVJ6|4.0|I liked it... unfortunately, I constituted half the audience at the matinee showing I attended.  I can't complain about the CGI... we've all gotten so used to seeing grand vistas, battles stretching beyond the horizon and brutal violence in full-view... most films use some kind of CGI.  The Griggs-monster (in the chopper), was very cool, but the tentacles-and-toothsome-gaping-maw was getting pretty old toward the end.  I didn't care for the art direction for the inside of the flying saucer:  I know it's an alien culture and saucer is ergonomically designed to accommodate an alien creature, but the problem was the outside of the saucer doesn't resemble the inside.  The inside looked like that organically-inspired, curved walled interior of the Jupiter 2 in the \\"Lost in Space\\" remake.  All in all, though, I found the movie exciting.  The fight in the rec room served as the \\"bomb-in-the-closet\\" in Stephen King's \\"The Stand\\", eliminating a lot of characters in short order.  The art direction for the camp and costumes is excellent!  I like the way the director got around rehashing the primitive computer graphics of the 1982 version during the investigation of the cellular activity by going full CGI, showing the cells as viewed through a microscope.  It may not have been John Carpenter's \\"The Thing\\", but is certainly wasn't \\"Saw 18\\", either.
0061537969|5.0|This book was recommended to me by more than one person.  Although I am a dog lover and own a golden, I do not read very often.  Once I picked up this book I couldn't put it down.  It is a quick read and now I buy it and recommend it to everyone.

B003Y5HWJU|5.0|The importance of being Irish. Or: another chapter in rep(tilian) history.<br />Martin Scorsese and Mark Wahlberg produced this charming TV series for HBO's family program (an Italian and a Swede? Hm).<br /><br />Its subject is gang business during prohibition. The plot is centered in Atlantic City, with Steve Buscemi as bossman. It also branches out to New York and Chicago, with various popular local heroes such as Lucky Luciano, Meyer Lansky, and Al Capone. Not to forget, Ponzi in Boston, but he only as a footnote.<br />It is primarily an ethnographic expedition into the meaning of being Irish. Other tribes serve as backdrop: the Italians, Jews, African American gangsters of the time.<br /><br />What do you call a sober Irishman? A corpse.<br />Buscemi's Nucky Thompson loves to spice up his public speeches with such jokes. The Irish are the backbone of his boardwalk empire. His brother is sheriff. The police force are his enforcers. Even the temperance ladies invite him to make speeches. He will follow his maxim: never let the truth stand in the way of a good story.<br /><br />Nucky is not only in the booze business, he holds a key role in district and state politics, controlling the Republican party machinery. Among his achievements is the support for Warren Harding for the Republican nomination. We know what became of that. Nucky knows it too. He knows that he helps to put a fool into the White House, but he needs those roads built... (it seems to me, Harding wouldn't surprise us among the current reptile batch).<br /><br />Aside from business and politics, on the personal level, we watch with chuckling amusement how the bossman gets erotically entangled with a widowed temperance supporter, who turns out to be less saintly than we thought. Apart from that, there is the problem that it was Nucky himself who had made her a widow. She is not supposed to find out. This is all about politics and power.<br />Towards the end of the season finale, Nucky has won the local election for his mayoral candidate and he has made peace with the gangs of New York and Chicago, but we see an inner-Irish conspiracy against Nucky take shape. We can't wait for season 2.ce with the gangs of New York and Chicago, but we see an inner-Irish conspiracy against Nucky take shape. We can't wait for season 2.
B006ZTYQYG|5.0|As always, the Vampire Diaries cast does not fail to entertain.  With Damon's snark...the mystery around Meridith Fell...Bonnie's mom...and Stefan's downward spiral...this episode was fast, furious, and had many angles.  The final scene had me cheering...but at the same time my stomach literally dropped.  Stefan's scenes with Elena were heart wrenching...and I certainly hope the writers continue to use the three leads in a way that balances this little triangle. :)

B003AQBYUG|5.0|WOW!  Grab this version while it lasts, 1/2 off the \\"american\\" version!  I had no problems playing these in my blu ray player.  The studio did such a great job with these re-issues, if you are a fan at all I would recommend you pick them up.
B000PFUAO6|5.0|They're still doing it, making tremendous progressive rock \\"journeys\\", just made for a workout, road trip, or just putting on a great set of headphones and disappearing into the journey.  I love how they still make 'their' music, with lots of great keyboard work, and the 15 minute tracks that will never become radio fodder.  Even with the lineup changes, i hope they keep it up.  If not, i've still got a lot of Dream Theater albums to discover.  You should too!

B00169N0BK|4.0|I wanted a spectrophotometer to profile my monitors and printer. I could not afford an iOne plus software. I have used X-Rite instruments for years and the ColorMunki fit my budget. I was surprised at the quality of my monitor and printer profiles. The software is simplistic but functional. I would recommend the ColorMunki for home use but go with an iOne and MonacoPROFILER for serious color management.
B006IW8DJE|5.0|Director Kaurismäki has created a story that is appealing as you watch it, but whose images and motifs will linger with you for days after you see it. His use of colour and lighting makes this visually alluring and his choices in casting have given him a pallet of wonderful faces to explore in his artistic manner. I had the impression at times of seeing a series of paintings of the Old Masters in an Art Gallery.In addition, there is a gentleness and a timelessness about this film which lifts it beyond the confines of its plot and setting. As other reviewers have stated this is not an action film as its plot is neither frenetic, nor full of the normal thrills many movie goers seek in such films.Another strength of this film is the strong acting from all members of the cast. There is a wonderful French feel about this film and many of the shots of the port city are quite lovely. I highly recommend it to those who are seeking more than simple entertainment and who would like to have a beautiful artistic experience.
0307279189|4.0|I picked up this book because I've heard a lot of buzz...and it was worth it.  A mediocre runner most of my life, this was a fascinating story.

B00000IQV7|5.0|Seeing this as a medical student is incredible. A great movie and a marvelously-acted telling of an even greater based-on-a-true-story story. Robin Williams manages, consciously or unconsciously, to convey feelings and emotions that are very honest and heartfelt--there are things in this movie that one would not possibly be able to pick up on and understand the depth of, if he or she were not in the medical profession. The complex and literally indescribable gestalt, gut feeling of being a medical student and connecting with one's patients shines as clearly as if Mr. Williams were the real soon-to-be-Dr. Adams. An amazing performance.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is a really fun game! My kids love to play with it! it helps pass time when your bored.

0374275637|5.0|One of the most important and interesting books I've read in a long time, with significant practical and philosophical implications. I'm sure a lot of this material is old hat to behavioral psychologists, but Kahneman's aggregation of it is accessible and even fun. The material changed the way I understand what it means to think, and to be human.
B006YMM64G|5.0|First off, this review is actually TWO reviews.  First is for the reviews you see here and the second about the movie.<br /><br />For the bad reviews: I seriously doubt they have actually seen this movie. Just by reading them, I can tell they have an agenda and their reviews are a carbon copy you will see for any movie that has a positive/Christian theme. It's always either \\"bad acting\\" or \\"Christian propaganda\\".<br /><br />So, please don't let the bad reviews keep you from seeing this awesome movie!  The acting is superb, the action is not predictable, and foremost, the movie does have a story to tell.  This movie does a great job of showing all the bad in this world WITHOUT all the negative adjectives main-stream directors feel the need to add to all of their movies.<br /><br />I not only will recommend this movie to all my friends and enemies, but also would love to see more movies of this type out of Hollywood.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am extremely pleased! I down loaded this to my phone. Now I have The Word with me at all times and can easily access a particular scripture whenever I need it in any translation.

B005JE7WKI|4.0|I saw this film and I wasn't expecting much. When the film started I almost turned it off because I could see where it was going and it didn't look good....I decided to give it a few more minutes and I'm glad I did! The film is silly and predictable, but charming and very clever. It is by no means a great film but I have to admire it for doing something so many horror comedies fail to do..make me laugh. It made me laugh and I watched the entire movie. It's short, but that's a good thing.  If you like horror comedies this is one to check out. It's good silly fun with great over the top gore!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is a fun game of skill. I recommend. My daughter and I have fun playing. It is a older game I have played in the past.
B001NEK2GE|4.0|I had the Belkin Nostromo n52te and enjoyed the feel of it, however the D pad was very difficult to use and there were not enough buttons for MW3.  This pad has more buttons and the D pad is excellent.  I also like the LCD screen where you can see and select the profile to use.  I have a big hand and it works well, but I would like to see it have an adjustable length like the Nostromo.  Not completely perfect, but overall very good and I would recommend this gaming keypad.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|First let me state how small this is, probably half the size of a deck of cards.  I bought this to bypass my laptops DAC, and the sound has improved a good bit from the on board sound. (Laptop->HDMI->TV->Optical cable->Fiio D3)  For $30, this simply cannot be beat. It's an all around great product. I've used a few of FiiO's products; they have amazing value (considering the price:performance ratio).  Don't be expecting anything crazy- this should only be used to get a clean optical to RCA output. I wouldn't buy this with the intention of improving sound (unless you're using something like a portable device i.e. laptop).  Please note that, as stated in the product description, this product does not support Dolby/Dolby DTS. I'm not entirely sure why some reviewers were marking this down because of that. That's like complaining that your mustang has only two doors. Do your research before you buy.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This is a very nicely done app that works well on my Kindle Fire. It's nice having an accurate weather forecast at my fingertips. The only complaint I have is that I wish it had hourly forecasts, however. Overall, I highly recommend it.
0307949486|2.0|this book is so pretentious. larsson- stop taking fifty pages to tell me something irrelevant to the end result of this thriller-esq novel. the novel is titled the girl with the dragon tattoo, but the actuality is that the novel is more about the journalist, and less about the girl. the whole aside about the photograph at the parade was such a waste of time, ink, and paper. when the action of the novel happens, the author finally decides to contain his writing, which is where he should have been verbose....ugh. such a mess. don't get the hype. let's hope the movie is better than the read! if you want to read a trilogy, read the hunger games, at least collins knows how to end a chapter and make a point.
B004SBX112|5.0|the title says it all. great game. I have all angry birds games and they rule. when will people stop. heating though? its annoying!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|This was my first Blu-ray disc (already had the DVD).  Unbelievable difference between the two formats.  However, I am only going to spend the extra dollars on movies that are special to me, not every one of them.
B000GW8RX4|3.0|Before buying this there are a number of points to consider. For instance the fact that the highly regarded Mr Blackmore is present and accounted for and this is from the days when he was still firmly ensconced in the rockin' and rollin' game - which means that for many who have been stoned since Osaka this is a no-brainer, they are just going to buy anything with their heroes name on it. So if you can name all the late 60's singles or projects that various Deep Purple members were a part of before forming the Mk 1 line up then.... why are you even reading this? Seeking validation? You already own it!!!<br /><br />But all jokes aside there are other factors to consider here and after the aforementioned Mr Blackmore there is the at least as legendary Ronnie James Dio on vox. I have read that this is the first properly shot concert footage of him (though am happy to be told I'm wrong on that score) and if so this leads this live gig to have somewhat of a historic value.<br /><br />The fact that there is also Cozy Powell on drums and that this was from an era when a lot of hard rock music was still fresh and new adds more lustre to the brew. While some reviewers have mocked the sound quality my copy doesn't seem to have any real issues. Perhaps it was some initial batch that had dodgy sound? The stage show is from the late 70's and this isn't KISS it must be said but seeing that electronic rainbow above, er, Rainbow, is kinda fun and it's actually refreshing to see such a down home honest stage show.<br /><br />All of the above are the positives about the actual gig. Negatives? Well, let me put it to you like this - here is the track listing;<br /><br />Kill the King - 4.42<br />Mistreated - 11.19<br />Sixteenth Century Greensleeves - 8.52<br />Catch the Rainbow - 18.11<br />Long Live Rock `n' Roll - 8.04<br />Man On The Silver Mountain - 16.25<br />Still I'm Sad - 27.33<br />Do You Close Your Eyes - 15.40<br /><br />Oh and I just double checked all that before posting this review and yep those are the correct running times. Now I'm all up for a (slightly) extended version in the live setting and a guitar solo and drum solo I'm not going to decry but.... well did you see those numbers? After playing it straight for the first tume they then take over eleven minutes to get through Mistreated, over eight minutes of improve for Greensleeves and thence meander over the eighteen minute mark for Catch The Rainbow. And as you can see from the above litany the fun doesn't stop there. Oh no, after the almost obscene brevity of only spending eight minutes to scurry through Long Live Rock `n' Roll they then spend over sixteen minutes of your life on the next track and over 27 minutes on Still I'm Sad. Now I know it was the 70's and this sort of gumph was in fashion with the heavy lidded set (lid, get it?) but heavens to betsy... And then the audience is barraged with over fifteen minutes of their life being taken up with the next tune. Now I don't have an issue with long tracks. I enjoy a bunch of `em from metal to classical but if you are going to do it then go somewhere with it. Not just flex your plectrum (ahem).<br /><br />Based on actual value for your time I'd have to rate this concert as squarely sub standard despite all the positive things I said at the start of this review. And if the producers were cheeky enough just to offer this then I'd give the thing two stars and watch the inevitable spluttering hate comments mount up. But what makes me give this an extra star is the bonus features. You get three video clips and these are great as they showcase the bands brilliance in a more fruitful setting from the commerciality of Long Live Rock `n' Roll to the more obtuse but no less greatness of Gates of Babylon. A photo gallery and interview footage round out the package and I note that this is often available quite cheaply so it's not a bad buy for the casual fan as long as they are aware of what they are getting.(slightly) extended version in the live setting and a guitar solo and drum solo I'm not going to decry but.... well did you see those numbers?

B005ISQ7JM|4.0|Some of the other reviewers are less than delighted that this book has no direct instructions on how to use HTML5. That was actually what I liked about it. There are many books about how to code in HTML and HTML5, but I'm not aware of that many that focus on the context -- what makes HTML5 similar to or different from other flavors of HTML; what are the strengths and weaknesses of HTML5; what problems was HTML5 designed to address; what are the alternatives to HTML5 (and their strengths and weaknesses); what other coding languages and tools make good partners to use with HTML5; strategically, how can you make intelligent plans to incorporate HTML5 in your own work or that of your enterprise; what types of products or projects are a good match for HTML5; what are currently HTML5 best practices; and expected future directions. There is more, of course. This short book is written in accessible language for people with some experience coding, but you do not need to be an expert to understand the content. The insights of this book would be especially valuable to managers who determine directions for programming projects, but are not necessarily coders themselves, as well as for people who are coders in other languages who are trying to decide if HTML5 is worth pursuing for their specific goals.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|OMG, what can I say.  This is an unbelievable performance!  I have seen write ups trying to compare the 25th with the 10th anniversary editions.  DON'T compare them, they are different from each other while presenting basically the same score of music.  Each has its high points (can't say that there are any low points in either performance).  Loved the international rendition of Bring Him Home on the 10th. Truly enjoyed the quartet and the 10th anniversary cast songs at the end of the 25th.  Les Miserables is an outstanding musical production and I HIGHLY recommend having both versions in your DVD/Blu-ray library/collection.

1439192812|4.0|I read this book recently and I think it's a great.  I highly recommended it if you want to open the door of science to young people.  I did have some difficulty following in some occasions, probably because I'm not a native English speaker (I am Greek), but McKean's drawings help.  Overall a great book.
0307891372|5.0|Guide is detailed to a point . only problem is there were a few incorrect puzzle solutions. But over all details on all quests . easy ways to level up ect.
1400052173|5.0|This book blew my mind. It was unbelievable the story that was told. As a living person I'm glad that so much has come from Henrietta's cells but at the same time it's sad and a pure shame that her family has not benefited from this as many others have. Doctors, scientists and the world has benefited in so many ways and yet her family didn't even have medical insurance. That's hard to accept. But if you're considering this book it is a good buy. I'm about to read it again. I read it in 2010 when I never read. Now I read books daily.
B006O5YHUY|5.0|I just finished watching this flick, and the fact that I wanted to waste my time writing a review goes to show how much I liked this movie.  It gets all of your emotions involved and while it has some loose ends it really doesn't matter.  Even if you don't think it was great, I would find it hard for anyone to say that they were not entertained after watching this movie.

B0000A5BTV|2.0|It was my first time ordering on Amazon and I purchased the movie, Wuthering Heights, through Movie Mars.  I had friends and familly over to watch it and it wouldn't work. Come to find out it was a region 2 ( UK ) dvd not region 1 ( USA )even though I typed in that I lived in the States.  Any way,  I returned it hoping to get my new one and in the mail and instead they gave me a credit for the purchasre price of the movie only....Amazon rectified the S & H after I contacted them with my complaint.  But, I won't be ordering from Movie Mars again : (  It's so disappointing ......

B005H0IW6W|4.0|This became the #1 selling Christmas album In almost every forum whether It be Itunes or Amazon or Billboard charts. I'm not a Michael Buble follower. I like his stuff, but It's not all for me.  Some of the standards are far to old for me to enjoy. Dated so much. Yet his self written songs Like \\"HOME\\" and \\"Just Haven't Met You Yet\\" are Incredible. He's full of all kinds of talent AND he works hard for It. Every day.  I can only give this 4 stars because the last 5 star Christmas album was Josh Groban few years back that still charts again every year!  But truely this be a 4 and a half star If I could. I Love most of the selections.  It's a good listen for a Christmas album. Only the new Christmas release of \\"She & Him\\" I liked better this year. You go Michael. On Top. He #1 In Canada of course where he from. So he has a huge Canadian following. This Is good folks. Listen to a friend or the librarys and you will want a copy for your car at least.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I'm like another reviewer in that I don't like popups. Other than that one annoyance this really is an amazing game.
B004SBX112|5.0|Always something new and exciting! I love the updates since most games you can dowload are just play, finish, and you are done. I get to look forward to the next installment!
B004R2DS9C|1.0|I purchased the LEGO Star Wars Toybox and Playmat from Amazon as a Christmas gift for my grandson.  I didn't fully open it here but saw him open it and was really surprised it seemed like a lot of money for very little.  Apparently I could have purchased it at Barnes & Noble for much less, and with no shipping charge.  I just thought it was overpriced and I was disappointed in it.  Usually what I order from Amazon is well worth the money.

0439023491|5.0|Did you read the Hunger Games?  Did you LOVE it?  At least like it?  Then Catching Fire is a MUST READ!!  One of the few books I've ever re-read!  And it was good the second time too!
B003U6BE8I|3.0|Honestly, if you've read the Percy books and you loved them, this movie will irritate you. With all the changes they made to the story, I'm surprised Riordan let them use the book's actual title. I would say this movie was loosely based on the book, not the book made into a movie. This movie is done nothing like the Harry Potter or Twilight or Lord of the Rings movies. This movie took the basic idea that Percy Jackson is the son of Poseidon and a lightning bolt was stolen from Zeus, and ran with it. Some things made you think Columbus actually read the books, but for the most part I think he must have been skimming, because there are some GLARING changes that I don't really see the purpose of.<br /><br />That said, the cast was great. (Although, I had a LOT of trouble accepting Annabeth's casting. That actress would have made an AMAZING Clarisse. Or even Thalia. Why they picked her for Annabeth, when there are TONS of blonde actresses they could have chosen, makes no sense. I also take offense to the fact that they continued to uphold the \\"only brunette chicks can kick ass, blondes are for ditzy romantic comedies\\" stereotype. Annabeth should be blonde. Period.) There is some awesome talent in this movie and I really hope they continue to make the series. Preferably with a different director.<br /><br />If I hadn't read the books and loved them, I wouldn't have disliked much of anything about this movie. It was a fun flick.
0439023513|5.0|Did you read the Hunger Games and Catching Fire?  Then you HAVE to know how it all ends!  Love it, hate it, or find yourself feeling somewhere in between, you've got to know how Collins ends it all!  And the books must be read before you watch the movie when it comes out.  Duh.
B004SBQAN8|2.0|This dvd was ok.  I feel that the book was much better.  I liked the action starting right from the beginning.  There did seem like there were some gaps in the story but not as bad as to not make sense.  Probably not a movie I would seek out to watch again but it is good for the teen age crowd.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|This works way better than a string tied around my finger. I do like the widget that allows me to see my list with a quick glance.  It is also very helpful to have my tasks synced with my calendar.  Very nice app!
B002HFJ77S|4.0|I'm not as much of a fan of Kinsella's Shopaholic books as the rest of hers, so I was pleased to see Twenties Girl come out. The heroine, Lara, is being plagued by the ghost of a relative she didn't know very well -- that she really didn't know at all. She goes through some phases of belief that seem reasonable to me as to whether she truly thinks Sophie is a ghost or she is crazy, and all the while it's pretty darn funny. There is a mystery to be solved, family shenanigans, romance, and life ponderings all in one whimsical package.  Fans of sf/f or paranormal romance or urban fantasy (which I am) might find the worldbuilding of the story a bit light and unexplained, but since it's Kinsella and compulsively readable, I was able to go with it well enough. Recommended!
B000003FMY|4.0|This was purchased as a gift.  I know nothing about this music but the recipients were satisfied with the CD. Additional CD's may be purchased in the future.
B0055SWM08|5.0|The artwork and music to this game are lovely. Although, I would add a more variety of songs. The game is really fun and I am not a gamer so it says a lot for me to like a game.
B005NGKMOU|1.0|This really isn't a movie worth watching.  Things happen - but that is a poor substitute for a plot.  There is no character development - and no particular reason to care about any of the characters other than the fact they happen to be moving across the screen.<br /><br />We are all familiar with dark and moody Westerns.  This is a light and moody \\"Western\\" (actually, since it takes place in Bolivia, I would say it is a \\"Southern\\").  The photography and scenery are beautiful.  Another reviewer complained about the color and I don't understand that because the colors are lush and bright.<br /><br />So, if you want to watch a travel movie about Bolivia, this is the one for you.<br /><br />A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE LACK OF PLOT.  These can't be a plot spoiler because there isn't any plot.  And I strongly suggest you not bother watching it.  But, there are some commments here about things that happen during the movie.<br /><br />The main character just drifts through the movie.  He causes innocent people to get killed - and he does some of that killing himself - but nothing happens to him.  What's the whole point?  He's the same person at the end of the movie as he was at the start.  It really isn't even a story - it's a series of events.<br /><br />Butch Cassidy does not act consistently through the movie.  At the end, based on the entire movie, he would have taken the Spainard's horse, not just let it loose. He doesn't.  Butch survives a point-blank gunshot wound.  That's not reasonable.<br /><br />The flashbacks are randomly inserted and fail to make any sense or really develop the plot that isn't there (how did Butch and Sundance escape the gunfight?  Who died in their place?).<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Beautiful photography, complete lack of plot and character development and reason to care about any of the characters.  There are many great Westerns out there.  There's simply no reason to waste your time and money watching this one.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|This year for Christmas, I got a kindle. I decided to get this book because I had heard only positive things from my friends and family about it. I bought it on Christmas Day and finished it on the 27th. I simply could not put it down. It tells a great story about a dog's view on humanity. He has already gone through his lives and is ready to become a man. This book tells the story of his life. Throughout the book, it brings joy, sadness, and many other emotions. This is by far, the best book I have ever read. Enzo tells His story very well throughout this book. I am very glad I bought and read this book. You will not regret this read.

0307456625|5.0|I found the book to be simple yet delightful. The stories reminded me of the television show, Murder She Wrote. Instead of Jessica Fletcher, you'll join the clever detective, Mma Ramotswe whose personal life is as insightful as the cases she solves. I already started book two, Tears of the Giraffe, purchased here on Amazon.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|AWESOME!! I recently enrolled in a photoshop class, and this app is like having a super simple, easy to use one!

1451627289|4.0|A time travel book with a challenging twist.  Mr. King is a master at putting the reader right in the scene.  the story was one of his best, IMHO, and having been in school when the real events happened, it was easy to relate to his \\"Long Ago.\\"  A great read and I'll leave it up to others to rate the ending.  Can't give anything away.

030746363X|5.0|I'm not usually into reading books on health / diet, but after reading 4HWW, I wanted to check out 4HB. So far I've read all the chapters on fat loss, building muscle, and testosterone. All very useful material. And concise... I feel like I can pick this book up and learn something new every time. I've been on the slow-carb diet for 2 weeks now and have lost 8 pounds. It seems like something I will be able to maintain for a while (the off day helps a lot!). Also have been doing the 2 ab routines Tim mentions and they seem to be doing the trick. Will find out more after 2 more weeks of experimentation with the slow-carb diet and exercise.
B006C1DH92|5.0|A ton of variety and superb gameplay make this sharper than the original. The new desperado mode which is basically survival plays out more fun, fast, and addictive than original. Bandito the official new mode is really excels at keeping things fun. It's like a campaign that changes everytime you play because of a lot of new plus random slicing games at various difficulties getting harder as you go but not too hard beat in 10 minutes if you do well. It's meant to be played over and over again which they succeeded in. There are cool new unique blades and new backgrounds to unlock.  The only problem with the game whatsoever is not having to ability to. see achievements you unlock. I don't see how they missed this. Maybe they only had gamecenter in mind on ios and forgot. It doesn't stop the game from being a new favorite and I wasn't even a huge fan of the first though it was good.  Bottomline get it and have a blast in short spurts. Runs perfect on EVO 3D no lag. I was going to give a 4* rating because of achievements but it's a 5 in every other area so I gave it what it deserves for game itself.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I've been using this cover about a month right now, and I think is a really good purchase. It is well solid built, fits really good on my Kindle Fire, the speakers, earphone jack, power jack and power button has plenty of space with this cover. Using it in the up position is nice and strong if you touch the Fire screen it wont slipt or fall, really secure. I recommend it.

B001RCD2DW|5.0|AKG is known in professional audio circles as a serious microphone manufacturer whose all pro products continue to be manufactured in Vienna. It is also known for its spectral preferences for neutrality-with-warmth without sacrificing detail and musical honesty at either end of the spectrum. I still own an antiquated pair of AKG phones, the long-out-of-date 400's. I was shocked and delighted to discover that just like anything old and reliable, AKG has upgraded its innards without sacrificing the essence of what those old phones offered - an exceptionally comfortable, over the ear long-time listening experience.  If you're a studio or control room rat, you may not be able to use an open-backed pair of headphones because of feedback problems or ambient room environmental conditions, but for stage width and depth, sense of spread, and \\"air\\" these phones have only the woefully uncomfortable, fussy and now largely extinct STAX phones as anything like serious competition. When listening at low level or background, I can often turn off main speakers in a high resolution system and listen full range with no degradation in image and detail when using only the headphones. Comfortable they are, and although their self-adjusting suspension system hasn't seen any upgrade for over twenty years, there's been no reason to change it.  Unlike many other high-end professional open backed phones, these phones don't pinch the spectrum or exert overemphasis at frequency extremes just to sound \\"more hi-fi-ish.\\" They are honest. If what you've mastered just isn't there on end-use playback, they'll tell you that, instantly and intuitively. They aren't \\"cans with built-in tone controls\\" like many of their open-backed equals in the same general price range (or much higher). They don't pinch a full tutti or become irritatingly confused with complex mid-range multi-instrumental demands nor do they lose their voice at low levels. Furthermore, they never lose their sense of balance and compose...something a critical concert goer and amateur musician looks for when experiencing others' performances. To combine utter honesty with profound musicality, these phones are an unequaled bargain. Without having to re-wire them with any special fat wire, the extra cost of having a detachable cable is not only convenient but thoughtful -- given our throw-away world's disappearance of authentically skilled repair technicians. An excellent bargain, available at an Internet dealer's discount price fully over a hundred dollars from their walk-in store retail price. As Harmon International continues to shed reputable high end retail dealers in favor of pushing its Chinese junk technojewelry, perhaps the only place quality items such as these phones may continue to be available is with the few pro-end dealers and specialty On-line sources. The only downside to the AKG brand is that its Vienna-based manufacturing is seeing fewer and fewer new products to feed the insatiable professional, home-studio, and location recording market. Turning to China to produce pig fodder for tone deaf, tin-eared consumers and prosumers may be all in the present and foreseeable future for business venture survival, but with the cost to serious listeners of forcing them further into revery for the loss of musical discipline and performance honesty.  Not hard to drive, but also not for the underpowered mashed compression of any lossy playback medium, these phones don't present a problem for most headphone playback circuits on standard quarter inch phone- plug equipped devices.  If you have to go to a 3.5mm miniplug headphone source, you're already out of the range of what these can phones. And no, for \\"that market,\\" size isn't everything.

1608193381|3.0|Some reviewers said not to read this book.  I think that was going to far.  I am not fond of its organazation , but it does let you focus on particular topics that you might be interested in.  I do not accept all of his arguments in favor of his topics , but I do agree with roughly 60-70 percent of his analysis.  I question some of his policy proposals though because I still feel that the government which governs least governs best.  That said, this book IS WORTH READING just to get a different perspective on economics.    I agree with his first thing. There is no such thing as a 'free' market.  The markets are always governed by the laws of the nation in which you live as well as according to the international trade laws in place between nations.  However, the fewer laws, rules, regulations, and taxes for market related transactions one has the better.    Since all men are not angels though, we need minimal regulations or laws govening market place activity.  For example, derivatives regulations. THus, I agree with his premise stated in things: 1, 3,4,5,9,13,14,17,18, 23.    I also agree with conclusions No's. : 1,2,3,4,5,and six. But, I disagree with him on conclusions seven and eight.  Nevertheless, I might still be willing to lean toward his goals in seven and eight ,if someone proposed a specific but limited in duration objective designed to jump start 3rd world failed state's economies for the benefit of the average citizen and not the elites running the show there.

B0062P3392|1.0|This film has a lot of action, but it's difficult to follow at times. At the end, a hired assassin gets to live happily ever after with his girlfriend. What kind of message is this? His buddy who's also a hired assassin also seems to be a family man, but the family is never shown. So, what does this mean? I guess it means that killing people is just another way of making a living, but it's not pleasant. The fact that these \\"family men\\" should get the electric chair or a lethal injection doesn't come into it. Just like Danny Bryce wants to swear off killing people for a living, after watching this, I want to swear off violent action movies.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|All men MUST watch this movie! It was such an inspiring, moving, and wonderful story about men being men and taking control of their families. Absolutely perfect! I only wish I could give more than 5 stars!! :)

You hear about anorexia but never really understand it until she put it into prospective. It is really a disease. It must be hard in Hollywood trying to be this perfect person with the perfect body, living your life with the cameras on your 24/7. I couldn't do it and I give props to anyone who can. Portia was raw and very honest in this book and for that I appreciate the read. Parts of it had me on the edge of my seat unbelievable the things she put herself through to be beautiful. Great read!!

1451648537|5.0|Without intending to do so, Walter Issacson has written a great trilogy on American geniuses who transformed their times.  Read this book on the industrial genius of our times, Steve Jobs, in conjunction with Issacson's other works on Albert Einstein and Benjamin Franklin.  You will see the flaws and the amazing minds of each.  A great biography makes you feel like to can set down with a historical figure and get to know them.  This book does exactly that and brings to life Steve Jobs with all of his many contradictions.  I can't say I would like to have had Jobs' life, but I'm happy to buy his products and happy he made a difference in our world.

B0024FAR5M|5.0|It seems like after the huge success of The Sopranos a bunch of TV/Movies want to capitalize on that success so I was iffy when I started to watch this, so like so many other shows I figured I would watch it since Netflix had it up for free. This show is actually a really good series that reminds me a lot of when I watched Gang Land's episode on Hells Angels and seems to do a really good job on what might happen behind those closed doors.<br /><br />The show did start off slow at the start but it speeds up really fast and gets chaotic towards the end. The episodes are a decent length at around fifty minutes long, and the season runs approximately thirteen episodes long. I think this works well with the show, and it never seems like any episodes are fillers and actually have a point to them.<br /><br />Since it's on a TV network you might be wondering if anything is cut out or maybe it's not as good as it could be on a private network, well it pulls back no punches. Its gritty, it's violent, and it's one of the coolest organized crime shows out there, and is still ongoing so the fun has just started.<br /><br />If you like a good story or like crime stories the least bit I recommend picking this up or watching this crazy tale on Netflix.<br /><br />~ Written: January, 2012<br /><br />Positives:<br />* Fast paced after the first few episodes<br />* Fantastic story<br />* Gritty violence<br />* Lots of twists and turns<br />Negatives:<br />* If you don't like motorcycles, then you may find this annoying

1451648537|4.0|While reading this book, I kept thinking to myself what has Steve Jobs done for my family. What did he change? We have an iPod which is rarely used and an iPad which I use a lot. We almost got an apple laptop, but I am not an apple fan, so I refused as I thought it was overpriced. However, almost all the music in my home is now electronic as is a growing number of my books.  Jobs had much to do with these changes. Then I was thinking how many householders are there, with all with this and more and it started to add up.  This book is a beautifully written account of his life. It discusses a man who was a mystic, technologist and a brilliant businessman. Worth a read.

B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Jacob is your typical rich-kid teenager.  He's not particularly good at anything but doesn't need to try hard - his family has serious wealth.  A natural loner, Jacob's the kind of kid whose only friend is there as much for protection from other teens as he is to infuriate his parents (the guy's got green hair).  His only bond is with his grandfather, a dodgy old coot who lived a life of adventure in his younger days.  But no longer - Grandpa is suffering from paranoid dementia - he claims that monsters are coming to get him.  Jacob tries to calm him down, only to have his Grandpa butchered . . . by a monster, the stuff of Jacob's nightmares.  Grandpa's dying words to Jacob raise some odd questions, but Jacob is too shattered to address them immediately.  Reeling from grief, guilt and horror, Jacob receives a mysterious letter that indicates that there may be some truth to his Grandpa's more outlandish stories.  So Jacob and his less-than-commanding father trek to Wales to explore the land of Grandpa's youth.  And it is here that Jacob discovers Miss Peregrine's home for \\"peculiar\\" children.  These kids aren't just odd, and they aren't freaks.  But they can do things that normal kids can only dream of - but in an attempt to keep this spoiler-free that's all I'm going to say about these fantastic kids Jacob meets.  What ensues is part journey of discovery for Jacob, part horror story, as the monsters who hunted for Grandpa continue their quest for Miss Peregrine and Jacob.  Riggs keeps this wondrous story grounded in the real world of a Florida teenager, but he spices things up with a series of creepy photos of the peculiar kids from the early days of photography, and these photos have to be seen to be believed.  This book reads like the first novel in a new series - if so, it's an excellent setting of the table.  Jacob may not be the most thrilling protagonist, but he's believable and, when the chips are down, surprised to learn that he's just a bit heroic.  A goodread for kids 10 and up.

B005Y9B5UG|4.0|I was so excited to be ordering this in the mail. It is an excellent and very exciting DVD for any Shakira fan.  It gets your heart beating faster, makes you want to dance, and for her slower songs it will even move you.  The sound quality is subperb. The picture is clear. The special effects add just the right spices to this musical DVD.  The Extra's are great and funny to watch, very interesting. However, I was hoping they would of added their bloopers in there,  which they didnt. But all together, this DVD is One Of A Kind!  Let the Shakira fiesta begin!
0385534639|4.0|I was mesmerized with the plot of the book, but it starts off slow throughout half of it. There are these little one-page chapters that are supposed to work on the symbolism between what's going on with the plot and the circus (as to build momentum), and I found it to be distracting. Otherwise, the arrangement of the stories in every chapter are nice because it all comes together in the end, and it wasn't confusing for me at all (it reminds me of \\"The Time Traveler's Wife in a way); unfortunately, I predicted the end long before the eventual climax. The time that the story takes place is during the late 1800s-early 1900s, where the Victorian Era is rampant and it makes the story ever so whimsical to imagine as I read it. I wished there was more character development. Otherwise, the book was an entertaining read, mostly enjoyable, and I don't regret purchasing it.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I dont understand how this got bad reviews, I loved it. Its so intense and just keeps you in it through all 3 books. LOVE IT. Plus I just realized after I finished all 3 that they are making it a movie. SO EXCITED. but read the book first, totally worth it.
B001F0WXY0|1.0|this book bored me to death.  it was hard to follow with way too much description.  scenes that should have been exciting took up five more pages then they should have, and quite frankly could have been made more exciting by a first grader.  I am an avid reader, and usually i enjoy a change in pace, but after struggling through 160 pages, i finally gave in to the fact that the book is simply over hyped, loved mostly by old people who compare it to poetry.
0385534639|4.0|If so, then Erin Morganstern's The Night Circus has it to excess. It is a really bleak story of an orphan girl who reconnects with her father only to be used by him as a pawn in some sort of competition. The mysterious competition is set in a wondrous circus that only comes at night and is almost entirely black and white.<br /><br />The hype surrounding The Night Circus is nothing short of amazing considering what the novel ends up being--a good book. But book of the month (and year) lauds and starred reviews from everyone? Didn't any other reader notice the book's odd timeline or question why so much filler in the form of lengthy description of circus acts? Why were there dozens of characters orbiting around a rather awkward and forced love story?<br /><br />It is different. And there is magic. Plus it's vividly descriptive in some places. All and all it's a great story, and I'll probably remember the concept for years (but it is overhyped). Not the best of the year. But worth checking out if you're looking for a unique escape.

B001UV4XI8|2.0|On both my Samsung players (BD-P1500, BD-C5500), this disc's audio playback stutters noticeably at several points in the film, mostly at or near climaxes in the action.  It's very distracting.  I bought a LG Blu-Ray player, and it plays them correctly, so this is compatibility problem, but it's one that Samsung should have addressed a year ago.  WB has been unresponsive to inquiries about the problem.  I'm not sure if the discs are out-of-spec in terms of peak bandwidth, or what, but the two Deathly Hallows discs are the only Blu-Ray discs that have misbehaved on either player.
B006ZBRMOU|5.0|I must say that this series has been one of the best series that I have read. I was so captivating. It had you going up and down with fifty's mood. I will say that book was my favorite, I felt that this 3rd installment jumped a lot in time frames. Kind of had me confused at one point. But overall the books were amazing. The way Christian's and Ana relationship is, mirrors a real life relationship and that's what I loved about this series. It wasn't all hearts and flowers like normal romance books are. it reminded so much of Beautiful Disaster, which is also great. A lot of similarities. It is amazing the lengths one will go through for the person they love. I must say when I read the synopsis before this book came out I was afraid this wasn't going to be a happily ever ending. But the ending was everything and more of what I had hoped for. It really sums everything up. They ending, which has part of Fifty Shades of Grey in Christian's point of view, was superb. I really wish James would of continued it. I am definitely interested in how Christian perceived everything. I would definitely read it. This series is definitely one to keep and read over and over again. That good!!!!!! I wish I could give this book more than 5 stars, but 5 will have to do.

B004I8WD6E|5.0|I've only had this case for a few weeks but so far:  The thought taken with the design and the care taken in the production fits right in with Apple's best design concepts.  The case fits the phone far better than the expensive Speck case fits my iPod Classic. It's tight enough to take some work to get the last corner over the phone, and the back raised circles are firm on the phone, so it won't be farkled by rattling around inside the case. The material of the one-piece plastic piece is very firm but also resilient. It's a tight fit -- tight enough so that it took some work to get the last corner over the phone. It was as tight the second time I had to put it on as the first. The phone is never going to slip out of this case (as my iPod Classic does out of the Speck case, despite the insert that's supposed to make the case fit the much thinner iPod Touch).  Silly it may be, but I love that the case is transparent -- all but invisible-- so I can admire the clean lines of my white iPhone4s. The case is easy to hang on to without being sticky. None of the lint in my purse has stuck to the case, which is only slightly short of miraculous. The whole case is beautifully finished, with no mold marks or rough edges. The generous slots for the buttons,mikes, speakers, and connectors have attractively beveled edges.  I haven't dropped my new phone and I hope not to, and not dropping the phone should be a bit easier with this case. When or if I do drop the phone, the case's protectiveness seems very well thought out and carried out. The material feels as if it will absorb some shock, and I would guess that the raised circles and arcs on the back will give another degree of shock protection. I've had iPods and and iPhone for years, and have cracked the corners of most of the hard or composite cases. That's not going to happen to this material.  The front rim of the case is raised above the face of the phone by perhaps 2 millimeters. It should protect the glass if the phone were dropped on a flat surface.  The phone with case does dock into my [[ASIN:B002I636XM Altec Lansing iMT620 inMotion Classic Portable iPod Dock with Rechargeable Battery and FM Tuner]] speaker -- after a fashion. Seems a little wobbly, but so does the iPod Classic.  The case came with quite a nice screen protector. If it hadn't been so windy, with dust and lint in the air inside the house, I might even have gotten it on without many bubbles. As it was, I couldn't bear the bubbles and lint, all too visible when the screen was black, and replaced the protector with a [[ASIN:B0060N3Q5M GreatShield EZseal 100% Bubble Free Guaranteed Anti-Glare (Matte) Screen Protector Film Mask for iPhone 4 / iPhone 4S AT&T, Verizon, Sprint Version (White)]]. So far this seems an unbeatable combination, and I have hopes that the firm material of the Great Shield protector will give another degree of protection to the glass.  All in all, and so far, two of the best things I've gotten from Amazon: the Amazon case and the Great Shield screen protector.

B000U0F7RG|5.0|I have been a fan of Gilmore Girls for years.  The quick wit writing is great even if I don't get some of the references, which is why I am glad they created the \\"Guide to Gilmore-isms\\" book.  The display box was bigger than I thought it would be, and is different from most (much like the series itself).  The case is well built with a padded exterior (all 4 sides), magnetic panel to keep it securely closed, and the handle on top is sturdy/functional which is good considering there are 42 discs along with the Episode Guide book and Guide to Gilmore-isms book.  I personally think this is a great gift for a Gilmore Girls fan.

0061122416|5.0|\\"Simple fable\\" fits well when comparing \\"The Alchemist\\" with a realistic novel, but the lessons to be learned for our lives (or renewed for what we have forgotten) multiply like sand dunes of the Sahara. At least something in the story can be applied in each person's life. Be aware: This is a symbolic story; it's not about finding material treasure.  I can see why this book is popular around the world, with readers of many cultures and religions, for it speaks those truths that most of us can most easily assimilate. I recommend beginning your reading expecting a simple story with deeper meanings, not a novel or fantasy; expect to learn something about life, not many details about characters or about the Sahara Desert.  After reading \\"The Alchemist,\\" look at where you are in your own quest for your life's mission. Did you know you had a mission? Have you considered that your previous objectives may not really have been your life's mission, or may have been only a part of your purpose on earth?  Without revealing a surprise in \\"The Alchemist,\\" I suggest after you read this fiction consider a similar surprise in the life of the author of the third edition of \\"[[ASIN:1466292113 Live Pterosaurs in America: Not extinct, flying creatures of cryptozoology that some call pterodactyls or flying dinosaurs or prehistoric birds]]\\" (a nonfiction cryptozoology book with a partial fulfillment of the nonfiction \\"The Alchemist\\"). But first read \\"The Alchemist.\\" The lessons to be learned from the fiction can sometimes literally find fulfillment.

1594744769|2.0|Step #1: Find a huge collection of authentic and uber-creepy antique photos.<br />Step #2: Write book based on creepy photos and incorporate said photos in book for full creepy effect.<br />Step #3: Give your book one of the coolest titles ever, using creepy photo for cover art.<br /><br />Ah...such a great concept. Such a great cover. Such a disappointment.<br /><br />Jacob is your average high-school slob whose life is upended when he stumbles upon his dying grandfather who seems to have been killed by a horrible creature (that Jacob's friend can't see). After a bout of severe depression, PTSD, and a few months of intensive therapy, Jacob and his dad head off to the island where his Grandfather was raised by \\"the bird.\\" Jacob's therapist believes that connecting with his grandfathers past may help him heal from the trauma. Also Jacob's grandfather had all these weird photos & stories from his childhood (which have to be fake right?) and Jacob wants to put to rest all the fantastical tales he's been told.<br /><br />Once on the island he finds Miss Peregrine and her Peculiar Children caught in a time loop - living the same day over and over, to keep them safe from horrors like the one that ate Jacob's grandfather. And despite the excitement of finally (literally you're almost halfway through the book by now) meeting the peculiar children, things start to unravel from here.<br /><br />The pictures and premise here are so strong. But the author lacks the imagination to create a truly compelling mythology to explain the peculiar children, the time loop, and why they need to stay hidden. Having grown up on books from Stephen King and Neil Gaiman, authors who are master craftsmen in creepy world building, I couldn't swallow the thinly conceived premise of the story. Jacob, the main character, is fairly generic. The peculiar children all have their own peculiar talent but have no character traits beyond that. I couldn't get beyond the feeling that the whole story was shoehorned together to make the \\"cool photos\\" fit.<br /><br />This book got a B+ from EW and was listed as one of the best books of 2011 by Amazon. So perhaps I am alone in my disappointment. However just in case, you may want to hold off unless you can pick this up at the library. Disappointment stings a little less when it didn't just cost you. $7.95.<br /><br />ps. Speaking of Neil Gaiman, if you're looking for creepy and spectacular check out The Graveyard Book which is brilliant.This book got a B+ from EW and was listed as one of the best books of 2011 by Amazon.

Maybe all he does is fly around in a hot air balloon and fight a guy in a metal suit that producers must have thought looks cool like \\"Iron Man\\" but is more humorously reminiscent of some 1950s B-movie robot.<br /><br />Let's say all of this is true. Because it is. Does all that necessarily make it a bad movie?<br /><br />No! Absolutely not! I mean, yes! Absolutely so! I mean... I mean...<br /><br />I mean, it's really hard to think now that this movie has turned my brain into Dippin' Dots.

B006ZBRMOU|5.0|I was skeptical about reading the FIFTY series because I was a die-hard MOTU fan. After recommending the series to several coworkers, I decided to read it myself. I just have to say, this is still my FAVORITE story of all (characters old and new). I have tried hard to find stories that captivated me like MOTU/FIFTY but nothing compares. Thanks for sharing...  I'll be waiting for future books from E.L. James!
B0017KIBAI|4.0|I've owned my GC controllers for quite a few years now; I primarily used the one that came with my black 'Cube, so as a result, the joystick has lost much of its tightness and, in turn, has became a bit less responsive. Not wanting to wait for the day that my controller finally bit the dust, I went searching for replacements. Trying to search for good 3rd party controllers roughly 6+ years after the fact is HARD. The only ones of good quality went out of production years ago, and the few options left are all plagued with QC issues. I had no idea, however, that Japan had continued producing these controllers quite some time after the US's Gamecube retirement. Long story short, this thing is perfect. But then again, it's a Japanese import, and you know the Japanese are all about quality products. I can offer no real complaint other than the somewhat boring white color; a creative and artistic soul may find this to be a nice blank canvas, though. The only problem is that this thing is expensive. I can pick up Metroid Prime used for 3 dollars at Gamestop; paying $45 for a last gen controller seems like the biggest of follies at best. But I will tell you; if you need to relive the glory days of Nintendo's classic underdog console, play some Smash Bros. Brawl without the corny Wii and Nunchuk arrangement, and have some money to burn, you will certainly not be disappointed. Also, it comes with a lengthened cable, although it's still not as long as an original with a cable extender.

B003L77TZI|5.0|Katy Perry's thrid album, Teenage Dream, Is a amazing  piece of music about Surviving heartbreak, forming  a bound between you and \\"The one\\" having fun, All while trying to stay young. Though perry herself is 27, I believe she made this album to remind everyone that they can still have \\"Young love\\" No matter how old they are. (I'm listening to the CD right know as I write!) Here is a song by song guide to My favorite album:<br /><br />Teenage dream: The first one on the album, It is very catchy and very sweet. The song amazing ever time you listen to it, with sweet, smooth pop. May be a little much for some, but the tune worked well for me and my radio that is probably one thousand years old. (9.5/10)<br /><br />Last Friday night ( T.G.I.F) The lyrics are a bit odd, but it's a catchy song that wants to make you get up and dance.(9.5/10)<br /><br />Californa gurls feat. Snoop Dog: You've probably heard this song a billion times on the radio, and has a absolute resion for it! It's SO catchy and stays in your head all day! Love it! (10/10)<br /><br />Firework: I really, really, wanted to like this song, but I feel like it needed a little more 'Sparkle', if you know what I mean. The lyrics are still amazing, though, and I look foward to listening to it after a bad day. (9/10)<br /><br />Peacock: SKIP...... Just another pop filler.<br /><br />Circle the drain: Rock song of the album. Very strong and encouraging song that makes you want to cheer for Perry's honest lyrics (10/10)<br /><br />The one that got away:  \\"In another life/ I would make you stay/ So I don't have to say you were/ the one that got away.\\" Sad stuff, huh? This song is just as catchy as it is meaningful, and I bet lots of girls could relate. (10/10)<br /><br />E.T: So mysterious and intelligent, you'll love it instantly, and I'm SO glad that they took out that cheesy rap verse that ruined the whole song. (10/10)<br /><br />Who am I living for?: Whoah, slow down, girl! Perry tried way to hard on her vocals, and I could hardly listen to it, but I still appericiated her efforts (8/10)<br /><br />Pearl: I heard rumors about this one, but I ignorned them and just listened to the song. And wow, I'm glad I did. The message i<br />strong and touching, and Perry sounds beautiful. My new favorite (10/10)<br /><br />Hummingbird heartbeat. I admit that I wanted not to like this song, but I love it. The songs a warm, easy too relate companion o 'Teenage dream' (10/10)<br /><br />Not like the movies: The strong message is a quirky compian to the soothing melody. This one is Perry's best vocals. ANOTHER<br />one of my favorite.(10/10)<br /><br />There are two hidden remixes, one of California gurls and another of teenage dream. See below:<br /><br />Californa gurls remix: I love this one! The song's even better than the original, which is hard to beat! (10/10)<br /><br />Teenage dream remix: I like this one, but it's not as good as the original. (9/10)<br /><br />Highly recommended!!!!
B00000JNNY|5.0|I've lifted a glass tonight on this sad day.  I never saw Etta James live, but when she appeared on Austin City Limits one Saturday night several years ago, I ran and put a tape in (still had VHS) so I could have it to replay it again, and again.  This was real.  And tonight, I ordered four of her CDs I didn't own, that I was always going to order but never got around to it, and hopefully before Amazon runs out of stock tonight.  I wish that Austin City Limits would issue her performance on DVD or whatever is the current way of doing such things.  It was a night to remember, and replay.  I love to play an early recording of \\"I want to make love to you,\\" so fiesty, and then follow it with the Austin City Limits, \\"Do you know what love is?\\" so world weary.  And between the two is a lifetime.  If you don't have all the Etta James in your collection that is available, then this is the time to do so.  What would be truly wonderful if there was more of her concerts available on DVD. (only one that I can find). The CDs are wonderful, but now that we can't see her in person, we can at least still see the magic of her on video.  I am emotional right now, I can't help it.  THere  are special people like Etta James, and she shared so much of herself with us, one would want her to be with us forever.  Fortunately we have the recording, but one can't help but wish she was still here...
B0017ZB8M6|4.0|Katy perry debut album, One of the boys, is a unique perspective of realistic troubles. It's pop-rock tunes and advanced themes may not be ad good as Perry's next album, teenage dream, but it is as satisfying as a piece of pie.<br />Here is the song-to-song guide of one of the boys:<br /><br />One of the boys: A okay song that's a bit boring, and has a annoying message about how you can't be strong and beautiful at the same time. Luckily, the chorus saves it from being a skip. (8/10)<br /><br />i kissed a girl: The perfect guilty pleasure song, with it's lyrics and rock'n roll beat. The only problem is that like 90% of it is the chorus, and only the last couple of verses stood out to me. (9/10)<br /><br />Waking up in Vegas: Whoah, a hilarious song about waking up in Las Vegas and regretting everything you did last. And I LOVED the sound of a slot machine at the beginning. I would probably group this with 'Hot and cold\\" (10/10)<br /><br />Thinking of you: The only decent ballad on the album (see 'lost' or 'I'm still breathing'). Very touching song that makes you want to shed tears with it's poetry like lyrics. Reminds me of 'The one that got away' from the Teenage dream album. (10/10)<br /><br />Mannequin: This ones okay, I guess. Started of nicely and could of been great, but it ended in a way that makes you think 'That's all?\\" (8.5/10)<br /><br />Ur so gay: A odd song with some silly parts, but I feel like it shouldn't be on the album for some reason. (8.5/10)<br /><br />Hot 'n' cold: My favorite song on the album! It has a cool hip-hop beat and funny yet meaningful lyrics, and Katy wins a billion points for her effort. (10/10)<br /><br />If you could afford me: LOVE this one! Katy gets really creative by using money terms to describe a miss-matched realiship and how love is more expensive than anything. (10/10)<br /><br />Lost: SKIP... some call it beautiful, I call it boring, and I felt the lyrics did'int match. (2.5/10)<br /><br />Self inflicted: Another great'guilty pleasure' song. The tune is more rock than pop, but the lyrics.......well, I hope katy's using comparisons, because, well.... Listen to the song and you know what I mean. (9/10)<br /><br />I'm still breathing: A little better than 'lost', but still, see above. (3/10)<br /><br />Fingerprints: A cute song in which Katy complains about fame is'nt glamourous, but rather steotype and tiring. (9.5/10)<br /><br />Buy the album, even if you have to skip 'lost', and 'I'm still breathing'
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I got a Fire from my wife Mara and look at every for a calendar and this is the BEST, as in 3 minutes I got all my GMAIL events and now I can just use gmail cal to keep all my events and just sync. You really need this app.  Dennis
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Good old time missle shooting fun! Very much like the desktop, but even better! Finally got over the 200,000 mark.
B003YUC2FE|5.0|I didn't own any of the Toy Story movies so this was perfect for me.  I received all 3 blu ray movies, DVD movies and digital copies to put onto my ipad and ipod.  The packaging isn't the greatest but for the price it was great.  The bonus extras on are the dvds and blu ray copies and very enjoyable too.  My personal favorite is Toy Story 3 but that was the first Toy Story movie I've seen.  Toy Story and Toy Story 2 are excellent too.  Nice.
B005K17RU0|5.0|accurate weather info. easy to use . I can check out other cities using the app. I have no thing bad to say a bout this app
B003L77GH4|5.0|I have actually enjoyed the Vampire Diaries so I was pleased to be able to pre-purchase the second season. I enjoyed this second season as well. Great price, great entertainment and fast delivery.
B0033H7VI6|4.0|it comes well packaged in a quality box.its larger than i expected.it comes extremely sharp.its not what id call elegant but more like a body builder on steroids!! to be fair its the first survival fixed blade i have purchased so although i like it it lacks a certain finesse.i cant fault the knife only to say it does not feel at home in my hand ,but i wouldn't dissuade anyone from purchasing one.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|love the challenge of all the different games. plenty of variety. some thing for every one. very entertaining. works great on kjndle
B0063IH60K|5.0|free app so there is a pop~up after each game, but they are easy enough to skip.  i enjoy it, just not having to review it.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Simply one of the best thought out, written, acted, directed and produced series on television. I'm hoping they can keep the momentum going in consecutive seasons.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I piled up stacks of scrawled notes and preferred it to any of the other modern note-taking systems until Evernote! it's perfectly, exactly what I need, and I only use maybe half of its features!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Great, horror series for adults. Certainly one of the best Zombie series I've ever seem movie. I'll buy season two.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I down loaded this when it was the FAOTT. I don't pay for apps, so I base their value on whether or not they would be worth spending money on. That being said, even though I really like it, I probably still would not buy it. But again, that's just me not wanting to spend money on something I'll probably grow tired of stop playing after a while. As far as the app goes itself though, it is the best missile defense app I've played. I have a droid2 and had no issues with the game or phone while playing.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Great, fun movie for all ages.  Certainly one of the beat of Marvel comics converted into a movie.  I'll buy a sequel.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is lots of fun to play, I highly recommend it. It's easy to use and provides hours of entertainment.
B004LL1HM4|3.0|In theory I like Fleet Foxes a lot. Think melodic melancholy of Simon & Garfunkel with a more modern soundscape. In practice the melancholy is there but the melody falls flat. Alas, boring.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this is a fun,fairly easy game. beautiful music. I'm not through all levels yet but I'm thinking I am going to wish there was more.
B004W4N55C|3.0|please add support and this will be a5 star app.. Was the best app until it won't open on my galaxy nexus or any Android ics device.<br /><br />(edit) although their customer support did nothing to assist my many requests, I have to be fair. After researching myself, the galaxy nexus has a \\"Forced GPU Rendering\\"  option in the developer settings that must be disabled in order to run this app.  NO THANKS TO THE SERVICE TEAM the app IS up and running nicely.
0062112430|5.0|Delirium.<br />Insanity.<br />Dementia.<br />Madness.<br />Love.<br /><br />Delirium is set in a post-apocalyptic \\"community\\" where everyone lives sheltered lives safe from the effects the deliria, or love. Scientists have discovered that the reason for war and suffering in the world is owed to love, and therefore, they created a cure for this disease that is administered once you turn 18. The side effects of this cure are that people become colder and more distant, mothers can't be seen hugging their children, and teens are separated by gender. \\"Suggestive\\" music, books, movies and anything that could contain explicit content relating to the deliria are prohibited. They even re-wrote the Bible to mirror their beliefs and keep people believing that this is a deadly disease (it's called the Book of Shhhhhh). Our heroine Lena would like nothing more than to receive the cure to rid herself of painful memories of her past. She must pass her examination, be matched to a decent boy, receive the cure, and live dully ever after.  Her mother died years ago, and she can't shake the feeling of hollowness left behind. Her mother would block all the doors and shut the curtains and dance with her children, the last thing she ever said to Lena was \\"I love you. Remember. Don't let them take it.\\" These words haunt Lena as she struggles to balance her messy life and staying under the radar.<br /><br />That doesn't work out quite like she planned. On one fateful day she meets a boy. As in, restricted. As in, she could be sent to jail just for seeing him. Alex.<br /><br />At first she's wary of him, I mean, if I'd spent my entire life believing that interaction with the opposite sex before the cure could kill you, I'd be wary too. They run into each other a couple of times and she finds herself liking him. Don't misunderstand me, it's not love at first site, nor is it obsessive and superficial. They get to know each other, and at the same time she begins to realize how mistaken everyone is, that love is not a disease at all. Alex is a great character, he isn't perfect but he also isn't too angsty.  He wants to help people see truth, and he genuinely loves Lena. Lena is a practical girl, plain (in her opinion, especially compared to her best friend) but not whiny or over defined. She grew on you. Always a little uneasy about breaking the rules, but she matured in character toward the end and became strong. Her best friend Hana was a bit of a rebel, she became invested in the idea that maybe getting the cure wasn't the best idea after all. She and Lena had a strong friendship that lasted.<br /><br />The end was a bit of a surprise I must say, but I won't spoil anything for you. You need to read it yourself. Lauren Oliver's writing style was beautiful and poetic which complimented the story. If you've heard it was like the Hunger Games, it's not. These are two COMPETELY different genres. I liked each as much as the other, but don't walk into this expecting action packed scenes. There was some action, but not enough to qualify it as an action book. Anyway, I cannot wait for the second book.<br /><br />Favorite quote: \\"Love: a single word, a wispy thing, a word no bigger or longer than an edge. That's what it is: an edge; a razor. It draws up through the center of your life, cutting everything in two. Before and after. The rest of the world falls away on either side.\\"is a great character, he isn't perfect but he also isn't too angsty.  He wants to help people see truth, and he genuinely loves Lena.

B0050ZPAPA|4.0|I couldn't put this down! From start to finish, this book is gripping and funny. The mythology is well researched without being overpowering or stuffy. I finished this and immediately bought the next two in the series! Would really recommend this for an older teenage boy.
B0017XD3OY|1.0|Whoever likes this movie, or even thinks this movie does justice to the book either hasnt read the book, or is a literary moron. Please tell me how this movie stayed true to the book? Please tell me how it did justice to the book? How on earth do you do justice to a book when nothing in the movie is the same as the book? I do not understand how anyone can think this movie gave credit to Matheson, or his Novel of the same name?  I am never been so offended in my life. Nothing in this movie is the same as the book, NOTHING! Its offensive how different it is, and i can't believe anyone would support it, or complement it in any way. Its a slap in the face of Matheson, and anyone who says it give credit to the book obviously can't read, has little understanding of the literary world.  Do not watch this movie and think you are getting the novel. You are getting Hollywood, you are getting a beautiful piece of work and you will watch be destroyed. I tried not to give it a star, but Amazon wont let me.
B005HSG3TC|1.0|The quality is great and it works well as a cover. It will not work as a stand. I returned it and do not recommend it.
0062082353|4.0|The first chapters of American Sniper are a perfectly suited introduction to the aw shucks, God, Country Family school of American kickass manhood. It is mind-bendingly simple to understand exactly why this nation will continue to be greatly defended for generations to come, because anyone who reads Chris Kyle's book and knows where Kyle is coming from (I do!) will recognize in a heartbeat the kind of Texas cowboy we will always have millions of. Kyle himself would never tell you that he's a one man army, but he is just the kind to fill the top ranks of the best army on the planet so long as it's funded.  There's only a little to say about the metastory here, as I will be slightly intrigued but much informed and entertained by the story to come. That is that you see in Kyle's story, the new soldier - the prototype by which humanity will be defended for generations to come.  He is not an outsider. He is not from the dregs of society. He loves his father and his family - his is not desperate for approval. He rises to the challenges of defending his country, and it makes all the difference that he is a volunteer and that this remains a free country. So long as our military institutions retain their transgenerational links, then they will be the fuel that will power militaries of the future. We must hope and indeed pray that armies comprised of such free men will remain victorious from here on.  It's corny. It's easy to understand. Because of that we are most fortunate. We retain the formula. He's just a fighter and he hates to lose. He understands that he has become a weapon and he is serious about his patriotic committment. His mission is a job and he is remorseless and relentless. He understands the deal of morality he has made, and he values an American life first. That is the kernel of it. The rest is training and experience, and now his knowhow is plowed back into instruction. That, my fellows, is a professional, and that is what we want our military forces to be.One more thing. I would compare this book unfavorably to Wasdin's SEAL Team  Six. I must confess that I like Wasdin's sense of himself as a warrior and as a person better than I like Kyle. Kyle is his own worst enemy talking about the kind of man he might have been if he were better. It's the kind of explanation those who are apt to respect him don't ask for and the kind those who are apt to disrespect him will find ridiculous. He's a soldier. Period. I'm sure it comes off much better in person than it does in the book.  At any rate, we are fortunate to have all sorts on our side.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The app is fun.  You need to earn points to open other games.  Some games don't make sense but all in all app is fun.
B006P96PAO|5.0|I'd heard a lot about this film and decided to rent it and see what it was about.  The movie has a lot of moving scenes, a strong moral message, and avoids the \\"pollyanna\\" I've come to expect from Christian literature and film.  Well worth the watch.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game is fun and exciting. I enjoy playing it all the time.  my kids enjoy it also.  we even see who has the highest score.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love the variety offered in this app. it works really well on my device as well. I'm addicted. thanks.
0316666343|3.0|\\"...Rape is difficult for me to read, and it's even more awful to me in this book because of Susie's young age and the gruesome way in which she dies afterward. Sebold treats this delicate subject matter well, though; perhaps because she herself was a victim of rape. The scene isn't drawn out, and we get only those details which are vital to the understanding of the story. So to anyone wary of picking this up because of this topic, I would at least give it a go, because the reading of it isn't as bad as I anticipated. Of course, you may end up not being able to get through it, but trust me - at least try, because it's really an extraordinary book...To me, this is a story of trying to pick up all the pieces you can and moving forward, one step at a time. Not just for the people Susie left behind, but for Susie herself as well. It's a very good book, quite sad, though, so if you're a cryer, maybe keep a box of tissues handy, just in case.\\"<br /><br />For full review, please visit me at Here Be Bookwyrms on Blogger:<br /><br />herebebookwyrms dot blogspot dot com

B0062QRTKA|5.0|I got my Kindle Fire a few weeks back and kept this on my saved list since very few apps really pop for me and tonight I decided to give it a shot. I could not be happier. This game was cute and fun and humorous and with a.decent difficulty ramp to boot. I kind of hope it gets to.be the FAOTF if only to get some recognition. Well with the 2 bucks to me and I'm picky as hell on games. also, don't let the biblical theme bother you. It's just a theme, with nothing preachy or weird. Just a nice simple game with good graphics and a neat premise. Like a reverse version of Lemmings basically.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i love this app because it lets me read the scripture any time you want ( as long as you have wi-ti)
B004KV3PI4|5.0|That is four effing brilliant albums in a row. Why can't I get people interested in this band? It is some of the most stirring and remarkable music I have ever heard. Rich sonic textures, superbly themed and interwoven melodies. The Cure meets Porcupine Tree meets The Pixies plus pure unbridled original genius. Cannot. Get. Enough.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to use, understand and enjoy. I particularly love the option of being read to! The drama version really redraws you into the story.
0439023521|5.0|An amazing book, truly captivating and well written. The story is timeless and is soon to be made into a movie to hit the big screen.

B000K7VHQ4|5.0|. . . I first viewed this movie in summertime.  This movie stood in stark contrast to all the summertime blockbuster action movies.  Because of this, I think the movie went largely unnoticed at the time.<br /><br />Nonetheless, this is a truly fine production - great acting, great story, great script, great premise - and with remarkable cinematography depicting the period.  It is one of my favorites; and I've watched it several times.  Highly recommended to those who enjoy a great love story wrapped in a paranormal meme.<br /><br />Edited to add this:  The sound track is a real treat . . . it is nothing short of wonderful!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is over average but will get a bit boring if you cant win the games. Even though, this still was a pretty cool game!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the best game I have ever played.this game had 117 action packed games. best game Ive ever played

0451232577|4.0|A novel of love and war by master storyteller Ken Follett. Fall of Giants is the first in his new Century Trilogy, covering the beginnings of the twentieth century.<br /><br />We follow five families from several countries through the period right before World War I up to the mid 1920s. Viewpoints of people and politicians from Russia, Germany, Britain, America and other countries involved in WWI were distinct. We see glimpses of battlefield trenches, espionage, diplomacy strategies, love affairs, and women contributing to the war effort from home. I learned a great deal about the political intricacies of the war, class struggle (fall of the aristocracy and rise of the working class) and the women's suffragette movement. Much time is spent on the politics of war, and while I would have preferred more plot development, I respect the research that went into this historical tome.<br /><br />Each character is well-fleshed out and the plot nicely paced. I found the characters fascinating and distinct, but dwarfed by the ramifications of war. The love story between a British woman and German man was icing on the cake, but left me wanting for more information about them. My favorite character was a miner from Wales, William Williams (or Billy Twice). Two Russian brothers switch identities. The implications of that are fascinating. The cast of characters is nicely organized by country in the beginning of the book.<br /><br />Many reviews on Amazon scrutinize and criticize the book for stereotypical characters according to ethnic origin. I read the book purely for pleasure and enjoyed being entertained and instructed. Nothing can compare in my mind to Follett's brilliant [[ASIN:045123281X The Pillars of the Earth]], but perhaps I just prefer the medieval period. Still, Fall of Giants was compelling enough for me to want to read the next two installments in the trilogy.<br /><br />Reviewed by Holly Weiss, author of Crestmont
B0055SWM08|4.0|Quell is a fun thinking game. Time flies buy while playing.The game is well worth the. 99 cents they charge.

B000O8OTNC|3.0|Don't really understand all the \\"great\\" reviews of this sharpener. I used it for a long while and didn't have any good experiences. It makes knives sharper than they were but nothing close to a razors edge. I don't know about anyone else but I love my knives to be able to shave hair off my arms and slice through paper.  This sharpener will definitely not allow you to do either. I guess its \\"OK\\" for quick fixes and to keep in your car but it is definitely not my \\"go-to\\" sharpener when I'm home. I Purchased a Work Sharp sportsman sharpener and that thing blows this product OUT OF THE WATER!
1594202842|5.0|Great book!  Whether you agree with her parenting style or not she writes a terrific memoir.  Her writing style is clean cut and straight forward.  I highly recommend this book.
0062082353|5.0|I liked the prose of this book -- feels like your sitting and having a beer with Kyle as he tells his story.  I think it fits the purpose of the book and probably is very much like Kyle's personality.  Really enjoyed it and recommend it.  Thank you for your service.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is pretty much amazing. its so cool.  it has so many games to choose from. I definetely recommend it. 5. stars for sure.. you wont regret it.
0525478817|5.0|I don't have to review the plot (it's been done).  I don't have to tell you the characters are well developed (it's been done).  I don't even have to tell you to have Kleenex near by (it's been done).  I just wanted to give it 5 stars. The comic relief is much appreciated.
0142410373|5.0|Was thrilled to find this book for my niece as it was my favorite as a kid - I was even more thrilled to see they had variations of the book for different reading levels so this was perfect!

B005ZO4TOO|5.0|the little ones were captivated with this great story and the pop ups were fantastic. makes for a great keepsake. i sign the books and date them so that in the furure they will be able to share with their own children.

B0063IH60K|5.0|After a long day it's very relaxing.  Great for children, cause you can set it to be a winning game or a challenge.  Teach young children problem solving techniques.
B000002BYD|5.0|That is the best album of the best band of all times!!!! The best songs are Wishlist and Do the Evolution.
B0042EJD8A|1.0|The \\"flaming water tap trick\\", for which this movie is most well known, has been around for a long time. It probably predates the idea of shale gas drilling by 50 years at least.  Of course, you'd never learn it from this movie. Mr. Fox presents it as some strange and new form of pollution.  This isn't the only piece of deceptive propaganda in this film, just the most prominent.
B002N5N5LQ|5.0|Why oh why isn't this fantastic show (aired in HD) available on blu-ray? Note to the Studio: the reason why I haven't purchased the series on DVD is only because I want to purchase it on blu-ray to see it as it was intended to be seen in HD... I don't want to buy it twice. So don't let any lackluster DVD sales fool you... fans want to buy this in HD and are holding back on the DVD for that reason.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|like the old missile command but with better control and simplified game play.  but the game only speed up as game progress, so, it gets repetitive.
0307593312|3.0|Ever get the feeling that an author is being paid by the word???  That certainly seems to be the case in this 923-page book.  Worse, I was reading it on my Kindle so I couldn't tell exactly how many pages I had left to slog through.  On the other hand, it is an interesting story.  So if you have lots of time and don't mind being treated by the author as if you have Alzheimer's, get it, read it, and enjoy!!

B00321SMFO|2.0|I love the show, but I would look elsewhere for a digital copy. The only way to watch it is through Amazon's Windows only player, or stream it through a browser, which won't be 1080p unless you have a really good internet connection. If you want to watch it on your android, iphone, PS3, or xbox, you are out of luck.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it it is very clean and easy to use. Any Christian needs this! I think everyonevshould try it out. much better than flipping paged
B0063IH60K|4.0|Basic solitaire that works with out any glitches on my kindle fire.  Entertaing way to kill a little inbetween time.
0525478817|5.0|You know, the one where you finish something-experiencing something, and you know that there will never be another time when you can experience it again in the same way-as the first time.  That is how I felt about this novel.  I felt that way after finishing the Harry Potter series, leaving the theater after the final movie, after reading The Hunger Games, and after finishing the initial listen of countless albums by TMBG, The Mountain Goats, Ingrid Michaelson, and more.  It is because of this feeling that I know that John Green's latest novel, The Fault in our Stars, will live in the celestial glory of trans-generational celebration.  It will become, for so long as there are people to remember it, a novel that is listed alongside Catcher in the Rye, To Kill a Mockingbird, Great Expectations, and the other 'classics.'  I have never sobbed so passionately, or laughed so genuinely whilst reading a novel as I have while reading TFioS.  You will walk away with a greater appreciation for your life, for your loved ones, and for your day-to-day existence, all-the-while being comforted by the grander notions (that I wont spoil for you) that John so insightfully reveals.  Though my tears have dried, I still feel for the characters in the book as I would if they were my own flesh and blood.  I think a part of me will carry them with me always.  Thank you John, for the gift you have given us all.  DFTBA
B0062NAX1U|5.0|These movies just keep getting better and better.  This movie really hits home with issues that today's society seemed to have forgotten. I highly recommend it.

B005K17RU0|4.0|I like it a lot. It does the job without crashing....however, I wish it had a rippled radar map....then it would really rock...
B00288KNJU|5.0|I bought this movie mainly to replace the DVD version (which got damaged), and thought the 3D effect would be 'okay' for what it is, but I was thoroughly impressed. I'm not on the 3D bandwagon (since most movies are not shot in 3D, just have the effects added in post), but this movie was great for it. Coraline was actually shot in 3D, and surprisingly with the anaglyph glasses, the depth is awesome. Also, for a blu-ray/DVD combo, it's a great price. Another bonus to this movie (for those w/o a new 3D TV - like me) you get to experience 3D on any TV.

0316017930|5.0|I would best describe Gladwell's Outliers as an expose of what produces success. He takes a good hard look at what makes people successful, with special emphasis given to counterintuitive trends discovered through his research (of other people's research). He beats this drum really hard, ultimately suggesting that this is what can make you an Outlier.
0062060554|5.0|That this is the first novel of SJ Watson is incredible.  This is a totally polished effort with an unusual and suspenseful storyline.  Be warned that the book starts a little slow but it is worth getting through the first few chapters.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|The very best app I have had in a long time. Totally worth the $0.00 I bought it for:)!!! It's sooooooooooooooooooo fun, I mean 107 apps all raped up in 1!!!
B005C9YZKU|3.0|hubbie wasn't expecting any gifts, but he was rather excited with the collector case and loves this series.  (also helpful for bouts of insomnia!)
B0058ZPMYG|3.0|I actually thought this was hilarious and Joseph Gordon Levitt was amazing, but it still falls into the category of \\"just okay.\\" In college I laughed at really stupid stuff like Bam Margera's CKY movies and this had those moments. It's just awesome to see the Hesher character doing, well, what Hesher would do. Plus, I loved the use of Metallica. The movie does change it's tones from this crazy guy comedy to a serious \\"needing to move on drama,\\" but it was enjoyable. I wouldn't personally own it myself but it's a movie I may watch multiple times with anybody who hasn't seen it yet.
B005WZZRD8|5.0|Woow! It's a relly awesome product! Born this way has great songs, the remixes are extraordinary and the monster ball is an unforgettable experience!  Besides, it is cheaper than buying every item separately.If you don't have yours yet, get it now! :D!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a really fun app! it has lots of fun games to play.you can unlock more by earning points!!!
B004UID2LC|5.0|I love this app. I have the Kindle Fire and I really love this one group but when I want to watch them I have to go on YouTube but I need wi-fi. This app allows me to download videos and watch them without wi-fi.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are pretty simple, but at the same time some.of them are quite challenging. I like it so far.
B0067EMFLA|5.0|I bought this CD earlier today and I've already listened to it 3 times through. Love it! Great lyrics and instrumentation.  I highly recommend purchasing it if you found any of the samples appealing, especially since it is only $5-$8.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is great app for both kids and adults. i am looking forward to all of the games. just wish the music Sasha little better.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|A truly nostalgic game I haven't had this much fun in years. works great on the Asus transformer.  Definitely recommend!

B004UID2LC|5.0|I've been using this app for a while with no problems at all. I download whole videos or rip them as mp3's to turn into ringtones. I love this app and it keeps me from buying ringtones. Sometimes i use it in place of the YouTube app to view videos as well...
B0054JZC6E|3.0|a lot of fun.  there are so many games to play. a lot ive never heard of but they're fun regardless.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I bought this toy for my 10yr old son, hesitant that he would actually break away from his Xbox to play a game with no batteries that required thinking. Well all I can say is that my son LOVES this toy and plays it everyday! I can't believe how great this product is. It challenges you and keeps you interested in playing more. It's actually addicting. Once you start playing it's hard to stop. Every child should buy this and take a break from all the electronics. I am glad I bought this and will be buying this for future birthday presents.
B004L49K20|5.0|I was really into the title track when it first got released online and I proceeded to download a few of the tracks over the past year (\\"Before the Rain\\", \\"Blame the Machines\\" and finally \\"Girl Panic\\"), but I held off on buying the whole album.  I suppose I expected a bit of disappointment, because there had been a lot of hype about the last couple records which I didn't feel materialized in the final product.  This is a different story, though.  So finally, I did get the edition with the dvd included and I'm really impressed.  It's a really solid album all the way through.  The dvd is a great treat, too.  It's nice to see how energized the band were in making the album and to hear their stories on the development of all of the tracks.  I've found a good deal to like on \\"Astronaut,\\" and I really liked \\"Meddazaland\\" (and moments at least on Pop Trash and Red Carpet Massacre) but those albums still don't touch the energy, overall quality and cohesiveness of \\"All You Need Is Now.\\" Great stuff here.  It's currently my favorite DD to listen to, and it should rank at least amongst the top few albums of their career.  And \\"Before the Rain\\" is a perfect album closer.
B0015DROBO|5.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a hard read.  Took me some time to get involved in the story.  Not one of my best reads.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Really great app. I have on my home PC, laptop, work laptop, work cell phone, personal droid phone and kindle fire. I love having my external brain with me everywhere.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I really like evernote I write almost every thing in it. I love the design and how it is easy to keep track of all your notes.
B000L53D4O|2.0|Yesterday the item was delivered to me. It has scratches on its surface. When you inspect the toy you can see its product date is 2006. So although it is brand new it looks like it is used. So I don`t like it at all.
B002J8LVO0|4.0|Sounding positively triumphant without retaining the martial, strident, aggressive vibe that characterized much of the material from U2's previous release, \\"War\\", \\"Pride (In The Name Of Love)\\", driven by its boyuancy, conviction, and catchy, elemental hooks, was the first and only track to chart here in America upon the release of \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\", and made me wonder before purchasing it if the other tracks it contained would match the strongest ones on \\"War\\" in projecting a qualitatively anthemic feel.<br /><br />Unaware that \\"Pride\\" was something of an anomaly on this recording, I was a bit disoriented after listening to \\"TUF\\" all the way through the first time. Where were the passionate, ecstatic cluster of tracks I'd come to expect from each of the releases preceding \\"Unforgettable Fire\\"? And while not an occurrence with a universal sweep, what was the deal w/r/t the subdued, moody, heavily atmospheric texture weaving through seemingly every cut but \\"Pride\\" and \\"Wire\\"? I'd never heard of a transitional recording before, and could only identify \\"Unforgettable Fire\\" as being one well in hindsight. Did this release mark a very long downturn for the fervent, wide-eyed, full-of-indie-cred U2, or was the band making a positive effort to alter some of the dynamics of their sound to evolve without necessarily losing their trademark level of intensity and passion?<br /><br />No real consistent universal thread runs through this CD other than a pronounced bent toward orchestration; lyrical content and musical arrangement are not unified by one overarching theme. While some tracks positively flow despite the new level of ambience brought to bear on the production values (\\"A Sort Of Homecoming\\", the conventional \\"Pride\\", the title track, \\"Bad\\" and \\"Indian Summer Sky\\")others are more like introspective sketches that never resolve themselves into tracks with any sort of progression (\\"Promenade\\", \\"4th of July\\", and \\"Elvis Presley In America\\"), perhaps due to the improvisational nature of the latter two and the lack of summative resolution w/r/t to the first. And it isn't as if U2 and the Eno/Lanois production team didn't have other material to work with; \\"Love Comes Tumbling\\", a down-tempo cut that nevertheless possesses a slightly aggressive insistence thanks to some nifty arpeggiated guitar work and popping bassline could've been inserted between \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" and \\"Promenade\\", while the rippling, explosive crescendo of Edge's guitar work and joyful, invocational quality of Bono's vocals make \\"The Three Sunrises\\" one of their most ecstatic songs, worthy of inclusion between \\"Indian Summer Sky\\" and \\"Elvis Presley In America\\". Neither track survived the final cut; both made their respective appearances on \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" single and their \\"live\\" EP, \\"Wide Awake In America\\", but would've been more strongly situated here.<br /><br />Nevertheless, there's enough about \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" that redeems it as a recording while also refining and redefining U2's overall approach to musical arrangement. While not one of their more vital releases, it still bristles with an introspective intensity that informs at least three tracks that still make the cut in concert, including two (\\"Pride\\" and \\"Bad\\") that are essential live staples. Recommended.

0307716511|5.0|One of the things that I am enjoying about being involved in Goodreads and writing a blog, is the amount of new authors that I have been exposed to. Rosamund Lupton is another one of those authors. Sister is her debut novel, and it is well worth the read. What Lupton gives us is a tale of the relationship between two sisters all wrapped up in a mystery. Rather than taking away from either story, these two stories fit well together and keep the reader involved. Bee flies to London as her sister is reported missing, only to have the police discover her sister's body and to have the coroner declare it as a suicide. Bee does not believe Tess would commit suicide and proceeds to try to prove otherwise. The story is told in the form of letters to her sister and Bee's ultimate recollection of events. I found both stories captivating and engrossing. The characters were excellently portrayed and believable. The relationship story had the right mix of nostalgia and poignancy. The mystery was excellent, complete with all the right twists and turns and an ending that was surprising on more than one level. Great debut by Ms. Lupton and I am looking forward to reading her next book.

B00475AYJQ|5.0|There are very few books or series that will make you read on and on ... and never put them down until your done, and worse yet, as you draw closer to the end, you're not happy that it is not going to continue.  This author has accomplished what few authors have done ... write an original, compelling tale that doesn't let up.  A lot of pages, but one with so many stories, and a remarkable mix too.

1594744769|2.0|I was ready to give this to my 8 yo to read and am glad I preread it.  Although it was interesting and the photographs were fascinating, this book has some language in it.  It also references a \\"bl*w j*b\\" in the first few chapters, when one of the characters is insulting his friend's mom.  This reference, the only rather graphic one in the book, is completely out of place and unnecessary.  Had the author used a different and less graphic insult or taken it out altogether, this book would have been open to a wider audience.
B000RO9VJK|5.0|As a small business consultant Ive given this book to hundreds of business owners and it has opened most of their eyes to many realities of small business growth. its good for what it is: a begginer book. And i think it's told in an interesting and compelling manner. Highly recommended.

B0064NTZJO|5.0|Without a doubt this movie will not appeal to some people, but if you love film you will love this movie. It is NOT a brainless action flick as some think it is, I don't even know how to define it. Very few times did I feel so amazed while watching a movie (I'm talking Pulp Fiction, City of God, etc).  Almost everything in this movie is perfect (I did not like the choice of secondary actors too much), and Rosling gives the performace of his life.  A true classic. Do not miss it.  I give it 9.5 out of 10.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|hours of fun, great time killer, almost endless gameplay very different  from other apps can get repetitive. love this application
B000002U9W|5.0|I don't know why the band left this out of that boxed set a few years back, it certainly has a character all its own.  I definitely think the group came into their own here as a BAND - not to say that the releases before this[1] aren't any good (they are) but this is a full album with a consistent feeling (that of sitting in an English cow field in the morning after waking up from an intense mushroom trip and having tea & toast) by an integrated band.  I first heard this around 1990 when a good friend taped me the CD, and the music has stuck with me all these years, from the horn-driven Atom Heart Mother Suite (so overblown but great), to the mellow thoughtful catchy If (which could be Roger Waters first song about/to Syd Barrett), the thoroughly enjoyable Fat Old Sun (nice melody, GREAT solo), and \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\" which is a hoot (and which I sometimes still jokingly recite whilst having jam on toast \\"marmelade, we've got marmelade!\\"[2] ).  In any case, this record is indispensable for any Pink Floyd fan, or anyone who likes interesting music.  PS Note that this review is based on the original CD (from the early 90s/late 80s? I have not heard the vinyl/cassette or other editions) which sounds fine to me. I am looking forward to checking out the remaster, which I can't imagine not sounding great.  [1] whereas  * Saucerful is transitional, with the group searching for their identity without Syd (it definitely has a consistent mood throughout, but I don't get a sense of David Gilmour yet)  * Ummagumma is essentially 4 solo albums with some live songs thrown in (the Syd songs are pretty much covers without him, though it's neat to hear them tackle the material)  * More is \\"more\\" of a soundtrack project than an album (has its gems to be sure),  [2] Go read the wikipedia history of marmelade sometime, it's an interesting story. And also the story of India pale ale and the use of hops. Those crazy English!

B0039TD7PY|1.0|I bought this for my husband to give him for the holidays.  He finally opened it and played it.  The first cd worked fine.  The second cd didn't play at all.  Will return it and try to get another copy.
B005LAIGMI|3.0|Traditionally, January is the time that most film studios tend to dump the films that they know aren't very good but that they're hoping they can still make some money off of before releasing them on DVD.  As such, I tend to approach films differently in January than I do most months of the year.  I go in with lowered expectations and yet, often times, I'm still surprised by how disappointing most of the films in January truly are.  However, this year, I'm surprised and happy to say that a genuinely entertaining film has actually been released in January and that film is Steven Soderbergh's Haywire.  In Haywire, Mixed Martial Artist Gina Carano plays Mallory Kane, an ex-Marine who is now working as a covert operative for a security firm owned by her ex-boyfriend (Ewan McGregor).  After rescuing a hostage in Barcelona, Mallory is immediately sent on another assignment to Dublin.  However, once she gets to Dublin and meets up with another enigmatic operative (Michael Fassbender), she quickly discovers that she's been set up and somebody wants her dead.  The rest of the film deals with her efforts to discover who has set her up and why and then getting her own brand of violent revenge on her enemies.  At this point, Steven Soderbergh could pretty much make this type of film in his sleep and, to a certain extent, Haywire feels a lot like Soderbergh on autopilot.  Fortunately, Soderbergh on autopilot is still usually more interesting than most other American directors working today.  He's using his usual tricks here (frequent flashbacks, a jazzy score, and an emphasis on style over substance) but he uses them well and the end result is an entertaining and fast-paced 90 minute film.  Gina Carano, to be honest, isn't much of an actress but she's a great fighter and the scenes where she's literally fighting for her life are all the more exciting because her amazing moves are not the result of CGI but her own natural abilities.  Ewan McGregor, Michael Fassbender, and Bill Paxton are all well-cast and Antonio Banderas has a lot of fun with his cameo appearance.  The final result is a genuinely entertaining film that's considerably better than the usual January cinematic product.
B002KSPKRS|3.0|These headphones are nothing short of a cool gadget. They have clear sound, and are amazing for movies and television shows. Unfortunately, the bass is sub par. Even with the so called bass boost on, it was similar to the bass you can find on the generic apple earbuds. As farr as the surround sound, it was quite amazing and immersive. Playing games such as Battlefield 3 and Modern Warfare 2 was great. Call of duty however was very loud. So loud in fact, that i had to either set it at one volume (which was fairly low, and these can be incredibly loud.) In order to not be deafened by hariers and explosions, yet not hear any footsteps, or constantly change it. When I Could hear the footsteps, i could easily identify the direction and location of anyone near.Mw3 may be better,  as far as sound goes, but i don't have it. I got an average of 28 kills and 8 deaths per game, over 7 games of team death match. Which, i can assure you is much better than when i use my 2.1 speakers.  There is a bad side to these though, and a deal breaker for me. Unless i am within 2 or 3 feet of the transmitter, there are constant pops and cracks which are VERY loud, and hurt my ears. With or without fresh batteries they will do this. And, if you are anywhere near a wifi router (around 15 feet) this is going to happen no matter what you do. And don't even think of plugging a cellphone in for music, especially if you use pandora or any other streaming music service. All you will get is popping and crackling.  Overall, these are decent headphones. They fit nice on my head, and are light and comfortable. For 70 dollars, i would consider keeping them, but at double the price they feel too cheaply made and the popping/crackling problem is too much to overlook.

The figure is highly detailed although the articulation is poor.  However this toys is not meant to be played with just displayed.  So who cares about the articulation.  Pick it up if you are a fan!
0525478817|5.0|As John Green said himself, this book makes you feel \\"all of the things.\\"  The Fault in Our Stars (TFiOS) is brilliantly written and is not your average \\"teen novel.\\" The words flow perfectly and the ideas and concepts are beautiful and thought-provoking.  Filled with love, heartbreak, laughter, sadness, hopelessness, and hope, TFiOS sucks you into the lives of some of the most amazing characters you will ever read.  This truly is an amazing book, and I strongly encourage you to read it (with a box of tissues of course!). Best wishes! (And don't forget to be awesome.)

B001N26GFM|5.0|I rented this through netflix and will be getting my own copy.  I didn't know anything about it.  It just seemed interesting.  As it's DVD only I'll urge them to move it to streaming so others might happen on it.  I grew deeply interested in the Holocaust maybe fifteen years ago while doing an edit on a friends novel, set in the time.  She wrote one chapter of the charaters ride in a boxcar to Auschwitz that I was reminded of each time one of the frequent freight trains passed by our house.  I knew of course what had happened before, but it personalized it, as one human beigns point of view, (especially since he knew what awaited them and many of the other didn't}  I started seeking out books written by survivors and the liberators and the ghastly black and white (later color) pictures took on a new life, about people.  This movie does the same.  I knew nothing about it but the short summary and wasn't sure what to expect, and was drawn in immedidatly.  Sure, there are inaccuracies.  The children would have been indoctrinated to a degree, the daughter most of all.  The boy is very much a child of war, witness the way his friends pretended a realistic view of how war is carried out.  And the husband, knowing his wife was uncertain and not completely patriotic, would have hid it better or been called and sent to the front himself.  But it isn't about that, its about the viseral experience.  When they arrive at the new house, with armed guards and a gate, when they see the stark almost prisonlike interior, you know what sort of a place they are.  Bruno is a dreamer, and dreamers tend to shut out certain perceptions.  And he's lonely.  His new friend knows what the place is, and spends time sitting alone.  Maybe in a different world they'd be very much alike.  And he still has his father.  You can see the panic starting to surface when his father dissapears.  The two boys make a connection through childhood with this magical spark.  Dreamers, in a harsh, terrible world,often pay the price of dreaming.  Not knowing anything about the end, I absolutely didn't expect it.  I was sure there would be *some* sort of reprieve.  It absolutely stunned me.  I would absolutely reccoment this film, but not for children.  But the end scene brings the body counts and the detains (portrayed VERY accurately) to a personal level.  They aren't statistics but real.  I have to wonder what happens to the family afterwards.  A commandant who allows that to happen would not be tolerated.  It would be too easy to figure out the mother was not a happy camper with the politics.  If your father leaving the counry gets you sent to the front, then what does this bring? That is the thing that works so well.  It makes me wonder, but its outside Bruno's knowing.  A mark of a good film is to keep you thinking after the end, but not going too far.  Absolutely deserves five stars.  I look forward to seeing it again, knowing, and see wht I pick up I didn't before.

B0067QPVJ6|5.0|I saw JOHN CARPENTER'S THE THING back in 1982 in the theatres and loved it for what it was, based on JOHN W. CAMPBELL'S novel WHO GOES THERE?.It was practical special effects at its best in 1982 with great story line and characters who sci fi fans have grown to love,including the menacing thing itself.THE THING shows up on the american camp as a dog from the norweigen outpost, during the course of the movie we get to learn and see some facts at the norge outpost and also see the ship and ice where THE THING has escaped from,So for a long time i have always wondered for years what really happened at the norweigen outpost,THE THING 2011 using the same title is a prequel and shows and answers many questions of what happened before the creature invaded the american outpost.I have just seen a few months ago THE THING 2011 and  loved it, throughout the movie we get to see what MACREADY (kurt russell) and the doc saw when they visited norge campsite.The Thing 2011 is intriguing and truly a suspenful science fiction.Even tough most of the creature is cgi effects it still blends in well keeping up with the traditional monster of the 1982 film.The 1982 version special effects to me is superior with its practical effects but the 2011 still maintains its creature effects with a tastful style never over doing the 1982 version so we get to see two sides of the creature in the prequel, we see the monster moslty and in the 1982 it quietly lurks in the shadows and no one knows who is who.We finally get a chance to see the inside of the spaceship as well as getting a glimpse of what the thing originally looked like.THE THING 2011 is a great addition to the 1982 version and in time will be a classic and of course The 1951 HOWARD HAWKS THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD is also a masterpiece even though its the hollywood version and based loosly on campbells book,over all, all three movies are great examples of pure alien terror that rips apart humans and the battle begins is what science fiction is all about,the will to survive under difficult situations.Most highly recommended and a great addition to a science fiction collection THE THING 2011.Thanks to the director ,cast and crew job well done ON THE PREQUEL............

0385344325|3.0|First, I must say that I enjoy most, if not all of the Reacher series of Novels. Some are better than others, despite the fact that they are all relatively compelling and a worthy read.  As for the \\"good\\" aspects of this latest tale, we have finally filled-in some of the \\"blanks\\" in Reacher's past. We can see part of the, \\"how and why\\", in which his persona developed. This backstory can always be built upon, and I hope that Mr. Child continues this sort of work. As usual, the writing style fits the type of book that we have here; it is tight and easy to read. It forms a cohesive bond with reacher's character, being a logical and basic style without useless flourishes.  The So-So:  The story itself is rather mundane, however. Not much compelling depth, nor plot-twists. Suspense is not up to the previous Reacher quests. The ending is utterly convenient and seems to indicate a looming print-deadline that Child had to meet. The resolution is \\"WHAM\\"!--2 people in a car, words are said, implausible action is committed, resolution is read aloud to the reader, and we wake the next morning to the new day.  That's not good. The recipe is familiar; Gorgeous girl, falls for reacher, he beats up 20 men at once, he has a toothbrush in his pocket, everyone else is stupid.  -----Spoiler alert if you read on-----  Now for the bad.  the plot:  -out of control military with complicity of a senator, including the hiring of toothless militiamen (how original?), shooting people on sight all over the HillBilly county. Seriously??? I mean, Reacher murders a bunch of people with no concern for his own chances of being investigated? There are no state police involved? Even worse, A Colonel in the Pentagon, jumps Reacher in a knife-fight? Seriously?? In his own office? Really? Earth to Child.......  In reality, if an officer was starting to become an embarrassment, they just ship him to Alaska. New title, new command, case closed. They don't start shooting people, and spreading a huge net ofnon-sense. The dig here is that Child has a semi-myopic understanding of the southern portion of the USA, and a cursory understanding of the Military. It was almost as bad as the Novel he wrote earlier, in which there was a cover-up of the dismantling of HumVees and M1 Abrams tanks because they didn't want Americans to know how bad the war was going. How about just leaving the broken vehicles in Iraq?? Too easy, right?? Better to bring them 5000 miles back home and start shooting civilians. I will add that this sort of plot plays well with the NYC crowd, of which Child is a member. he could do well sitting down with Tom Clancy for an afternoon!  But the worst part was that the ending was simply \\"truncated\\", for lack of a better word. You could see that Child needed to wrap things up quickly. Usually Child is stellar at the endings of his novels. certainly the 2 novels prior to this one were excellent examples!
B004EPZ06Q|1.0|The movie is NOT funny. It is also very vulgar. Sorry I purchased it. I thought it would be like the first but I was so very wrong. I threw it in the trash.
B005V1WVPA|1.0|I'm a HUGE korn fan... I think they are the pioneers of the best genre in the world... NU METAL!!! Well after all these years of being #1 with hits like \\"blind\\" \\"got the life\\" \\"my daddy raped me\\" and \\"falling away from me\\" they are back and better than ever! While I miss the old days of Korn when they would team up with Kid Rock, Linkin Park, and Limp Bizkit.. I feel that there is much progression in their music... after years of ruling the nu metal throne they have moved on to DUBSTEP METAL!!!  Nu Metal + Dubstep is the best invention in the history of existance! What more could you ask for? Jon Davis vocals over nu metal riffs and dubstep bass drops! Skrillex is a monster at bass drops... one day I want to get a haircut like his and be in a cool dubstep band! The path Korn has taken will definitely land them a stop in the rock n roll hall of fame.  And remember fellow metalheads.. DUBSTEP and Nu Metal rule the world!  Be sure to avoid DUMB bands like Black Sabbath, Rush, Dio, Boston, Saxon, Metallica, Megadeth, Accept, Pantera, Led Zeppelin, Kiss, Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix, Iron maiden, Judas Priest, and Cheap Trick!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app and the plans are wonderful! I enjoy having my daily reading ready and waiting when I open it up.

B0068RHSCW|3.0|I hope you haven't read Amazon's editorial review either since they are both spolier-heavy. I unfortunately have seen the trailer. After watching it thought that the movie might be rather interesting but then realized while watching the movie with a friend who had also seen the trailer that the trailer gave away some very important facts about the movie which takes away much of the suspense. If you are one of the lucky few who hasn't seen the trailer and if you haven't read Amazon's review but are interested in the movie for whatever reason but want to know something about it before watching it then let me tell you that this would fall in the suspense/thriller genre...If you haven't seen the trailer and want to know a bit more about the movie without wanting to reveal a bit too much I'll just say that the trailer gives away who Peter Ward(a suspected murderer and potential danger to the protagonist, Daniel Craig, and to his family)is and how to find him. One thing that might put off some people is that they may find a basic fact about the movie hard to believe. While rating this movie I wasn't quite sure how to rate it. It does for sure deserve more than one star because of the cast and the acting and I still found some things about the movie interesting. I just wish I hadn't seen the trailer which kind of it killed the movie for me...

B005HSG3TC|5.0|After searching endlessly, buying more than one case and rejecting/returning them all, I finally tried this one which as others have said, is absolutely wonderful for a number of reasons.  First, it is shockingly lightweight - almost seems weightless. This is important to me with this slightly heavier device.  Also important to me is the slim profile of the case - the design is such that it adds a minimal amount of bulk.  Aesthetically, this is the most pleasing case I've come across --- I love the way the Kindle Fire fits perfectly (really perfectly!) into the case. If you select the black one, you'll see it's truly an elegant solution.  One of my issues with most of the other cases was partly visual:  I really didn't like the look of the four-corner tabs or bands that often held the Kindle in place and was looking for a more seamless solution.  I think the protection of this case is excellent, though I'm not about to drop my Kindle to test it.  I use my Kindle mostly for reading while commuting so storage for the charger and having it stand for video viewing were not priorities for me.  The stand on this works fine if that's a concern and if you desire storage, well, then this would not be the case for you.  I highly recommend this.  I rarely write reviews but was so excited I thought I'd add my voice to the others who love this case.

Of the course the 16+ minute live version of Take Five (live) is the highlight here, however the entire repetoire here is superb and and any aficionado of Jazz or music period should own this disc or better still the album!
0307957934|4.0|If this book were a fighter or any athlete really, you'd say it is \\"cut.\\"  So well written and extremely well put-together, Harris delivers a strong thriller that is ripped with muscle.  This is my first Harris novel and it has inspired me to read others.  He has a perfectly pitched style and has written of characters who jump off the pages with real depth.  You can't go wrong here.

Unfortunately the dad dies and the Devil tells Johnny Blaze theres no loves for him.  So, he becomes a stuntman for several years until one day the Devil's son (?) wants to have power and only the GhostRider can stop him.  We get info from Sam Elliot who sure seems to know alot about GhostRiders (Hmmm).  Meanwhile, Johnny's first love has become a... reporter, uh, I don't know, like Peter Parker maybe? Hmmm. So, he is able to reunite with her.  People end up dead and Johnny's cycle plate is found at the crime scene so he is suspected, uh oh. He goes to jail, when he is around bad people or at night he turns into the GhostRider and busts out of jail.---  The baddies appear to be cast-offs from[[ASIN:B000R7I43Q Charmed - The Complete Series]].  In the end as with each new situation he has a new/different weapon he pushes back the forces of evil and even decided to keep his powers/abilities to fight... the Devil, so the Devil is ... unhappy/mad. Waaa.  Evidently this character is so interesting that after a mere FIVE YEARS later there is a groundswell of support that this needs to reserected for another movie to face a ... worserer force. Hmmm. And/or because they think they can sell some more tickets.  'You can't live in fear' is his motto and 'Look into my eyes' is his  catch phrase. Oh, and he likes Karen Carpenter and chimps on TV.
B000JBWWRY|4.0|There really are so many ways to tell a story, so many different things you can emphasize, so many characterizations you can change while retaining the essence of a story. Did Disney make the perfect Peter Pan?  I read this story to my daughter nearly nightly but had never actually seen this film. It's been around nearly 60 years as of this writing and I've been alive for many of those years but couldn't say I took the time to see this Disney 'classic'. After viewing it last night I have to say it is 'classic Disney'- what the Disney company USED to be. CLASSICAL music permeates it which is so different than the mainstream pop/contempo tunes in newer Disney fair. What I REALLY like (love) is how innocent the children are. There are no wisecracks, there is honest respect for parents and there's just a certain sweetness that never comes across in the newer films. Nemo (Finding) perhaps has touches of this innocence characteristic but nothing like sweet little Michael who clings to his teddy bear.  Another thing I love about this film is the animation. It's beautiful and, again, classic Disney. You can tell a lot of work and care went into every drawing and coloring. Even more impressive is the lack of any modern CGI, which may dazzle but usually distracts from the story.  The only things I didn't enjoy about the film are cultural and a product of their time. The portrayal as women as these subservient, empty headed objects is a bit much. The use of classical instrumentation for EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER MOVEMENT is barely tolerable. Seriously, does a full horn section have to start blaring every time Peter Pan leans on a wall?.There are a few bright musical moments, though ('You can fly', is pretty enchanting). Another thing that is REALLY painful to watch is the Indian scene; Songs like 'What made the redman red' and the characterization of the chief ('HOW' 'Me set-um you on fire' 'Squaw no cook, only bring food') cover  good ol' 50's racism and sexism at it's finest. It's weird to think people used to think like that. Perhaps such portrayals might have been entertaining to little children raised on poorly written Westerns on TV but these days it's the kind of thing that could be edited from the film to positive effect.  But for it's flaws I have to say it's still much better than most of what Disney puts out, which is remarkable for such an old film (1953). Definitely worth owning.  On a side note, $48 to own... really? I still can't figure out where Disney gets it's fleecing, I mean pricing scheme from. Am I the only one that thinks that's a bit steep for a children's movie? I have a hard time equating how the company considers itself 'family friendly' but prices it's products (theme park tickets, DVD's, etc.) in ranges that most middle class families would stretch to afford.

0785156593|5.0|I prefer to read the work with all of its crossovers contained, but Infinity Gauntlet completely stands the test of time.  Starlin created a masterpiece.  he handles all of these characters with aplomb, and you can feel your heart racing as the climax is reached.  The only drawback is that George Perez did not draw the entire series.

B00479SVBU|5.0|I'm glad to say that this FM Transmitter is by far the best and has virtually no problems.  It's not as good as a direct AUX line or a tape transmitter, but my car has neither so I am forced to use a FM transmitter or buy a new stereo.  I have tried several Belkin FM transmitters all of which gave me static or needed constant moving to get that sweet spot.  This is very small and can fit in a center dash and can be hidden very easily.  It's easy to use, and comes with everything you need to get started.  This receiver is even powerful enough to overpower any local radio station (Colorado).  The only slight fault I have found is when I drive on our local road over a dam, there is a very very feint static.  It's not from reception issues, just some other weird issue but it's very slight and can easily be drowned out by the music even if it's not very loud.  Great product.  I'd recommend it to anyone.

B0040JHLM2|4.0|Great running shoes for longer distances. They provide a good amount of support and cushioning, but they are also more flexible than say the trance 10's making the GTS's better for the slight overpronator and the trance 10's better for the slight to moderate overpronator. They are very comfortable and feel like they are made very well (as all Brook's shoes have to me), but if you are a moderate pronator, I'd suggest the Trance line. If you are a regular (flat footed)runner or a very slight overpronator, then go for these!  Overall, excellent running shoes!

B000008I4Z|5.0|I don't understand the critics who say it takes a while to appreciate this album.  If an album is a good album you should be able to appreciate it immediately, unless one is immature when it comes to music.  This album is fantastic, majestic and a real masterpiece from start to end.  There are a lot of intense and dramatic moments, and great musicianship.  I wished they would make albums like this again.  The band got really inspired at that point in time, and this album is a great testimony of this.  I could give you a song by song breakdown of the album (e.g. check out \\"goodbye to all that\\", \\"brave\\", for instance), but there wouldn't be much point in doing so because it is a concept album and all the songs are great.  They fit together nicely, so start from track 1 and play the whole thing.
068987474X|5.0|This book is great for your teenager who is just learning about love life. It would also be great for adults. But in my experience, the older you get the less you really need books like this. Book speaks to you, not at you. Gets you thinking on a rational level and helps with the grieving process of a lost relationship
B000ICM5IK|4.0|Most of the songs were great. If I knew that last few songs were Rap I would not have bought this CD. Also, some of the songs have script from the movies, which I didn't like. The vendor was great and the cd arrived on time.
B006NXIO7O|4.0|This is an action packed film with a female heroine of sorts. It starts in Bogota, Colombia in 1992. Cataleya Restrepo aged ten (Amandla Stenberg) is a young school girl, whose father is mixed up in the sort of things that one would not declare on a tax return. He is forced to conclude a `business deal' that is not to his liking - he realises that he needs to put some distance betwixt him and the inevitable trouble that is to follow. He fails and both he and his wife are killed more or less in front of Cataleya. However, he has given her a sim card an address in Chicago and told to go to the US Embassy.<br /><br />This then kicks off the action, involving some excellent street running and edge of seat stuff. Need lees to say she makes it to the US and to Chicago, where she contacts her uncle Emilio (Cliff Curtis). He begins her education and takes her into the family. The film moves on fifteen years to the now grown woman who is now Zoe Saldana and it must be said, to use the common vernacular - is `well fit'. She is now an assassin, but one with her own agenda and that is the avenging of her parents murders.<br /><br />She also lives a double life, has a seemingly pure sex relationship with an artist and could teach `The Dog Whisperer' a thing or two about attack mutts. We have intrigue with the CIA, the Chicago PD being inept but dogged and basically a full throttle action fest. There are plot holes, but this is one of those films where you can forgive them as they are done in the name of entertainment as opposed to being just sloppy.  It is from the pen (Screenplay) of Luc Besson (Leon, Taken and The Fifth Element) so you would expect a fair bit of polish. The direction from Olivier Megaton (I do hope that is his real name) is well above par and it does ooze style. The only places it falls down are the aforementioned holes, and it would be a plot spoiler to mention them. Everyone puts in great performances so not a lot not to like.

B0010X8NF0|5.0|I am not particularly a fan of Anderson - I loved Rushmore, but was bored by both The Life Aquatic and The Royal Tenenbaums. I am, however, a fan of good cinema. To me The Darjeeling Limited demonstrates both the beauty and simplicity of the cinematic form, but more than that, it demonstrates potential. It demonstrates what is possible, not only in terms of the creative form, but also what the Hollywood machine; the accountants, backers, producers and studio executives (those outside of the artistic process) are capable of agreeing to finance. This is the real brilliance of this project.<br /><br />In terms of the actual cinematic experience, the sets, costumes, music, cinematography, dialogue and performances are about as good as I have seen in a LONG while; this is such a very coherent project which is ultimately the antithesis of what the potential viewer can engage with if they head down to their local rental shop. I think this is a film even detractors should watch once, because I sincerely believe that to anyone who watches it, their frame-of-reference will be shifted, altered and expanded. If you hate this film, so-be-it, but you might want to ask yourself why; what underlies that dislike and distaste. Because maybe, just maybe,  the films you have been watching thus far in your life have blunted your sensitivities and sensibilities to real Art and real beauty. If you are unable to grasp this film and appreciate it then I would suggest you are lacking in your propensity and capacity to cognize the peripheries of life and Art.

B003ZSH606|1.0|If you were born after 1980 and you rated this CD highly, then clearly you know NOTHING about music. May I suggest, therefore, that you forage into your parents' record collection and see if you can't find some DISCO that was recorded before you were born. If they, like you, however, have had their musical sense culturally lobotomized and think this sounds in the least bit respectable, then I suggest you get on your cycle and ride as quick as you can down to your local record shop. When you get there ask the shop-assistant where the DISCO section is and closing your eyes just grab a few CDs that were made in the 1970s - anything should do. When you get home and you start to play these bargain-basement tunes, you will be like 'Hmm that sounds familiar... is that early Jamiroquai?' 'Wow! Is this Jamiroquai's new album?' 'Man this band sound like Jamiroquai! Are they a tribute band?' Answer: NO! You have got history WRONG! Music existed before you were born, in fact most of the good stuff was cut before you were even thought of. You are NOT the centre of the universe, nor the focus of history and your music taste (like the dreadful CD) SUCKS!
0375413405|5.0|After watching a recent movie about Julia Childs my wife was inspired to try some of the recipes featured.  It has in fact been a delight using the recipes from the cook book.  We haven't deboned a duck yet, but the Beef Bourguignon was most enjoyable.  We've learned quite a bit about culinary techniques. It's actually educational. We recommend this book.
B00013RC8O|5.0|In this day and age remakes are hitting the theaters faster than original movies. Some are better ... some ... well, don't quite hit the bar. For my future brother-in-law, only the original was good enough but he was striking out finding it. It was happy reunion for him and his favorite version of the Vanishing Point thanks to Amazon!

B004XNGKBS|2.0|This is good for making shopping lists, quick notes or personalized memos and letters. However, the finger detection isn't very good. You'll often find yourself  deleting words because letters get cut off very often. Your &quot;O&quot; turns out to be a &quot;U&quot;. That sort of thing. Maybe if I had a stylus it would work better, I don't know. Finally, the tutorial is also quite difficult to understand and the UI needs a bit of improvement to make the whole app accessible.
0312641893|5.0|My take:<br />Let me start by saying that I absolutely love the story of Cinderella and all of the movie versions that I have watched over the years: Disney's Cinderella, Ever After, A Cinderella Story, Ella Enchanted, Enchanted and Another Cinderella Story. I'm sure I will adore and own the upcoming A Cinderella Story: Once Upon A Song, too.<br /><br />And now, along with all of the fun Cinderella movies, we have a fantastic new twist to the classic fairy tale.  A cyborg Cinderella. CYBORG! Genius!<br /><br />The book begins with us meeting Lihn Cinder, a mechanic, working in a tent in the marketplace. We also meet Prince Charming Kaito (Kai) immediately. He has brought his personal android to have fixed and he has heard that Cinder is the best.<br /><br />We then meet the [evil] stepmother, Adri, and the stepsisters, Pearl (the one we all loathe) and Peony (the nicer of the two and actually friends with Cinder). The girls are, of course, being fitted for dresses to wear to the Prince's ball. Shortly after that, Peony is discovered to have letumosis...the plague. Adri blames Cinder and sends her off as a \\"volunteer\\" for plague research. Adri knows that those who volunteer for research do not live after the testing. Cue the \\"dun dun duuuuuun\\" music. The evil stepmother strikes!<br /><br />Cinder's blood is tested and she is injected with a strand of the plague but her body is immune and kills off the deadly microbes that were injected. She is really talked into being a volunteer to continue helping the doctor with more tests, with the option to stop whenever she wants. She really wants to help him find an anecdote so they can save Peony.<br /><br />Now, to spice up the story a little more, there's another twist to our Cinderella story. In Cinder, there is a race of people, called Lunars, who live on the moon. They have the ability to \\"glamour\\" themselves. Meaning they look like they want to look for you -- beautiful. Their Queen does this as well and attempts to get Prince Kai to \\"fall in love\\" with her *cue the \\"dun dun duuuuun\\" music* so she can rule Earth.<br /><br />The story goes on and the ball goes on, but Cinder has to go so she can pass on important information to Kai.<br /><br />I loved the world that Marissa Meyer built and how it still felt real. It felt very \\"Jetsons\\" like to me and I loved it! Hovercrafts, people living on the moon, comms to communicate, ID scans...love, love, love! I was hoping the news from the doctor would be what it was. It adds a whole new twist and makes me giddy! I will definitely be ready for Scarlet in 2013!un duuuuun\\" music* so she can rule Earth.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Of all the Bible apps I have used I enjoy this one most.  The function to read to you is amazing.  My daughter's will go to be at night listening to it.  I also love the reading plans offered, they are very in depth and help give you spiritual direction no matter what you are going through.  God Bless the team that works behind the scenes on this app.  I am amazed it is free with the depth they have gone.
1451648537|5.0|This book is positioned at the rare nexus of a brilliant biographer and an amazing subject. I've read several of Isaacson's biographies (Ben Franklin, Albert Einstein), and they never disappoint. He has that rare gift that I have always appreciated in a history teacher of being able to recount the past as an enthralling, engaging story. But with Steve Jobs he completely outdoes himself. The book moves along at a torrid pace. It is not told completely chronologically; but rather as a series of stories about different events. He tells the story of the iPod, then he tells the story of Pixar being sold to Disney, then he tells the story of the early failures of Jobs' health. All three stories overlap in time, but are incredible narratives in their own right.  I loved reading about why the Beatles did not permit the sale of their music on iTunes, how Jobs' took the idea of a GUI from Xerox (and Xerox management didn't even mind), the ideological battle over an integrated but closed architecture versus an open but inelegant design, how Job's set aside the creation of the iPad in order to focus on the iPhone.  I also enjoyed getting to know what made Jobs tick. He is portrayed with all his flaws; and they are many. This man who changed so much about our world was neither a good boss nor a good husband/father. And yet his employees and his family loved him.  I heartily recommend this book.
0738727326|5.0|This deck exceeded my expectations. For years I had been searching for that perfect deck that is both stunning and substantial (beauty and brains?) but to no avail. Just when I was about to give up, I come across this one and wow! It's too precious for words. Everything fits perfectly. If you're considering buying this but aren't sure, go right ahead. You won't regret it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is very fun, sometimes frustrating because I'm such a perfectionists, and I want to finish each puzzle perfectly, but fun none the less.

0385534639|5.0|Have you ever had one of those vivid, enchanting, surreal dreams that you hoped would never end? One of those dreams in which you think if you could put it in words, it would make the most wonderful story? That is the feeling I got while reading this story. Absolutely magical, the most beautiful story I've ever read. This is not a narrative in the normal sense. Not only is the book written in the first person, second person, and third person - it is not presented in chronological order. (Kind of fitting, since I feel the story transcends time itself). The writing is really what makes this book stand out. The words are just as magical as the characters, places, and events. There is really no way a review can ever do this book justice. I will be reading this again and again. The chapters with Poppet, Widget, and Bailey touring the circus are dazzling in their simplicity, yet beautiful in their depth. I loved every character in this book - from the mysterious contortionist to the star-crossed lovers (the illusionist and the proprietor's assistant). If I were a character from this book, I would be wearing a red scarf for sure!!  Thank you Erin Morgenstern for putting together this masterpiece and sharing it with us!  (I would give this book 10 stars if I could.)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This was an app I have downloaded out of boredom. I think that it is fun and the ads don't bother me at all. I don't understand the bad reviews.

B005HSG3U6|3.0|We ordered these for our kindle fire and put them on Christmas Eve for our kids. The Case is a great fit, it clicks right in, the elastic strap is good and functional and the case seems to protect the kindle very well... The Down Side?? I ordered white, because I thought it would look slick and clean.. however, after only 3 days of being on, the edges stated to turn a brown color and ALL around the edges, the top layer of plastic/rubber began to peel off. We have had this case on for almost 1 month, and it looks terrible. We are returning it and are going to try a black or dark colored one. We like the case, just not white.
B00499K9E0|5.0|I have always been a fan of Arthur Conon Doyles series of Sherlock Holmes and I have watched many versions of the different cases, but I must admit this has to be one of the BEST versions I've seen yet.  It captures your attention with the intriguing crimes and the enjoyable banter between Holmes and Watson.  I was amazed by how good it was...If you like Sherlock Holmes, and you like the mystery mixed with a little bit of snarky humor then I highly reccomend this series.  It gives you another glimpse into who Sherlock Holmes is BEFORE he becomes the greatest man Watson ever knew.  Plus there is a season 2 that BBC is currently working on which is a relief to fans out there.  Hope this helps.
0670022411|4.0|I downloaded a sample of this on my Kindle about 7 months ago, read it, and knew that I wanted to read the entire book.  I received it, read it completely within a few days, and honestly loved the whole thing.  I do agree that there are a few things that could have been cut, or not mentioned as much.  But I also feel that you can't read something like Twilight, Harry Potter, or any other supernatural/vampire novel and try to compare them to this.  Diana is not a 17 year old high school student who has never had a boyfriend.  She isn't ready within a few weeks of dating to become immortal.  She isn't a young boy who has no family and completely embraces his witchcraft and his new friends, new school, and the constant struggle with Voldemort.  She is Diana, woman who has dealt with her losses by cutting out the part of her she feels was connected to that loss-her magic.  She shunned her witchcraft in order to become a well educated and respected professor.  She has her rituals (no matter how mundane and repetitive they may seem) to keep structure in her life.  That is all her life has turned into.  Study, run, row, drink tea, avoid all things magical.  It's like a constant reminder alert in her head, and any deviation from that completely spins her off course.  I think may people can relate. Something horrible happens in your life and what do you do?  Ignore and shut off all things that are related or reminders of that.  Onto the topic of how vampires should be.  Do we base that on what we've already read?  Based on Ann Rice, Laurel K. Hamilton, Charlene Harris, Stephenie Meyer?  Who says exactly what they should do or be.  Drink human blood, sythetic, or animal.  Sunlight can kill them, make them sparkle, or they are fine from it as long as they are wearing their rings.  They own bars and strip clubs, own nothing but houses and lots of money, or creep in the night and live in sewers.  I mean seriously you can make a vampire whatever you want it to be, so who is to say that they don't do yoga?  Matthew might have a quirk like yoga, but for the most part reminds me of a what a vampire should be.  He has an issue with his anger.  When something belongs to him, such as Diana, it's his.  Period.  And he would kill to protect it.  He owns LOTS of stuff.  He has a hidden agenda (come on name one vamp who hasn't had one, ever!).  I don't expect everyone to like this book.  We are all entitled to our opinions.  She doesn't give you closure at the end.  It seems when they get close to answering one question, two more pop up.  Ashmole 782, Diana's parents, Diana's DNA, figuring out her witchcraft, the Congregation...there is a lot going on.  But personally, I enjoyed that.  I wanted to continually wonder \\"What is going to happen in the next book?!?!\\".  I loved the what ifs and the not knowing.  Cliffhangers are not always a bad thing in books.  Every book doesn't have to have a wham, there you go, the end.  Give A Discovery Of Witches a try.  Have no expectations.  Go into it with an open mind, thinking what you would do if you were in her shoes and those things happened to you.  You may love it.  You may not.  But either way you'll know you read it without comparison.
1592402038|5.0|This is a very popular book, because it does something one would think is almost impossible - it make grammer interesting.
B000FC1MOQ|2.0|I understand the desire to shock a reader to keep things interesting however, in this book Frey did not succeed. I first read this book as a senior in high school and was unimpressed. It's an easy read and is moderately interesting, enough to get through at least, but Frey's attempt at being brutal and honest comes off as unrealistic and cold. He as a main character, although fictional, is very hard to identify with let alone like. Overall I really didn't like this book because to be blunt, it sucked.
B003BLPTB0|5.0|These fit slightly better for me than regular crocs which are a tad roomy for my liking. They also look a little more slimline probably due to black inset section on the top. You might say they were a little dressier than the regular crocs though Crocs and dressy doesn't seem to sound right somehow. I suppose it means you might wear these where you wouldn't the others. No complaints from me especially since I got them for under forty bucks.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great resource. so many versions. the plan is a great feature as well. thank you youversion for making this app available
1419702238|5.0|I must admit at the beginning that I am probably five times the age of most readers of this series. Yet I eagerly read each new volume because Kinney's words and drawings are funny, timeless, and refreshingly honest. The Wimpy Kid books remind me over and over again of incidents in my own childhood, or in the lives of my children. They are appealing and clever without having to resort to unnecessary vulgarity, as many kids' cartoons do. They are good enough to be placed alongside the best in children's books of the past (such as Booth Tarkington, or, dare I say it, Mark Twain?).  This new volume deals with a very short stretch in Greg's life: a winter where, among other things, the family (without dad) is snowed into a house with no heat or electricity and diminishing food resources. I hope that Kinney finds more ways to stretch this series out (credibly) so we can all continue to enjoy reliving the fun and foibles of youth.

B004IL7DRA|5.0|I got these watches for my boys, ages 3 and 8 for Christmas - they love them!  They are completely adjustable, and since the links come out, there is no extra watch band dangling around.  The link nearest the watch face even is a real lego piece to they can attach a lego man to it. The clasp has never come off accidentally, so it's secure, and my 3 year old has not yet figured out how to take it off, so the watch stays on - great value for money - I love these watches!

0525478817|5.0|I'm not usually one for young adult fiction. Even when I was a younger adult and teenager, I prefered more sterotypically \\"adult\\" books, romances, horror, and fantasy (which I suppose can be argued is for any age, really. But it's not generally about teenagers and their school problems, like YA books are).  But a friend of mine introduced me to John (and his brother Hank) Green's fabulous YouTube vlogs, and after a year of watching them, I decided to pre-order The Fault in Our Stars (admittedly, it was partially because I was truly impressed that he SIGNED ALL 150,000 copies of the first printing! Talk about dedication!)  I foolishly had the book shipped to my school address while I was still away for winter break, so I instead read Looking for Alaska and Paper Towns. By the time I got my copy of TFiOS, I was addicted to John Green's writing. TFiOS is beautifully written. It's funny, it's quirky, and it makes you cry. It's definitely different from his previous books; for one thing, it has a female narrator, and for another, it's darker, deeper, and far more impactful. it's not his first book dealing with death, but it's the first time I've gotten so attached to the characters that, even knowing from the begining that this book probably wouldn't have the happiest of endings, I was truly sad when one of the character's dies. I had really started to feel like I KNEW these characters.  I still don't think that YA fiction is my favorite genre, but I will happily continue to read anything John Green writes. I just love his style, his humor, and his way of creating characters that really feel like people I could know. TFiOS is a true masterpiece.  (I also want to add that this book has made me completely fall in love with the name Augustus. It doesn't have to do with the character, it's just such a great name! I have no idea why John Green chose it, but it is absolutely perfect, and SO gorgeous...)
B0054JZC6E|3.0|For a set of free games, this isn't bad. My biggest complaint is the lack of instructions for each game.
B004LWZW8I|3.0|I thought like a lot of other people this movie was going to be like \\"300\\", not really, the Visuals maybe, but it was more like \\"Clash of the Titans\\" but better ( I did like \\"Clash of the Titans\\") the fight scences where awesome but I was confused, this being about the \\"Theseus\\" and the Gods.  Why did everyone look like and fought like the had some training in \\"MMA\\"?  But thats just me.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|WOW angry birds is soooooooo fun expecialy on my kindle fire I love It and if I love it than its the best game in the UNIVERSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :-))))))) LOVE G.sonnier
B0067QPVJ6|4.0|The \\"CGI\\" was awesome in this movie, I tried so many times to try and say \\" he or she is the alien\\" but I was wrong of course,  thats one of the reasons why I like this movie and I also how everyone was so on guard instead of being the opposite.  I never saw the first one so I cant say the Remake was better, but it was better than I thought
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome it is the new pink. I love it try it your the best its better get it your better
B004LWZW7E|4.0|Im not a Timberlake \\"Hater\\" I dont listen to his music but his a funny dude from what I've seen on SNL, Jimmy Fallon and other shows.  When I saw this Trailer, It got my attention but I was still hesitant, but of course I watched it or why else would I be doing this Review.  This movie didnt skip a thing, usually im that guy who watches a movie and find something that would or could question the some if not all of the movie, \\"In TIme\\" did a great job explaining the movie and the Politics with in the movie along with the different Social Classes in it as well.  The action scenes where elabrate and not over the top. I reccommend this movie, for the reason that it would change your first intial view on a Timberlake action film and how the plot might seem corny etc.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Wish i could afford to purchase this movie for every one I know it is awesome Love It Love it love it
B004EPYZT4|2.0|This movie was type casting at its worse, by type casting, I mean casting a big guy who can arch his eyebrows for every other close up scene.  I watched the old \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" with Arnold and I didnt really like those either, but this movie was.....  I lost count on how many times \\"Conan\\" Made a \\"Aargh\\" sound and twirled his sword and threw it in the ground......  Why?  For one it dulls the sword and it doesnt look cool at all.  I do not know the production budget of his movie but some of the \\"CGI\\" scenes were pretty crappy.  The only reason why I gave this movie two stars, was because the of the first fight scene when Conan was a Kid, it was pretty bad a$$.  So for a even shorter Summary:  \\"Aargh\\", arching eyebrows, posesing with the sword, constantly ending up shirtless and a corny ending.  There you have it.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I really appreciate the way I can just pick up my kindle and have read the translation of my choice at any time.  It lets Ny switch versions without purchasing a new book every time.

I'll probably be looking for another one next Christmas.  I ordered it late, but was pleasantly surprised to get it by Christmas.  Thank you.
B0059M7ZVG|5.0|I bought this after listening to a few samples and for $5 what could go wrong?  Best buy so far this year in music.  Sounds somewhat musically like Helloween but the vocals and lyrics are different.  Excellent headbangin material.
0307943194|5.0|This is a classic John Grisham book. Not overpopulated with characters, the ones you 'meet' are so believable and so colorful. Chapter upon chapter builds as you come to believe you know where the story is headed... or do you? I have read or listened to many of Mr. Grisham's legal genre stories -- they don't disappoint. This is among his better ones.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I thought it was a very fun and educated game that requires a lot of brain power, skill, and strategy.

B0064X7FVE|1.0|Just like TWC on your TV this app is annoying and give little useful information. This app sends constant notifications just to tell you the current conditions, completely unesscessary and irritating. Only offers VERY basic forecast info. Amazon appstore sucks for app offerings, they need to add Weather Underground.

B004EPZ070|5.0|Something Borrowed is about two girlfriends, named Rachel (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Darcy (Kate Hudson) who have been best friends all their lives.  In this movie it's a thin line between love and friendship. In Law School Rachel had a huge crush on her study partner, Dex (Colin Egglesfield) who is Darcy's fiancé.  The night of Rachel's 30th birthday Rachel tells Dex how much she loved him.  Dex and Rachel start hanging out with each other.  Dex is having a hard time deciding which girl to love. John Krasinski also stars in the movie has Rachel friend  has a secret.  Watch the movie to see who ends up with who.  Does Rachel and Dex end up together or does Darcy and Dex get married?

B0036EH3WK|4.0|What's that? You have an opinion of the television show LOST already formed in your brain case? Such a shame as I had quite a fantastic exploration of the show and all of its intricate subplots and themes. But, since you already know what you think about the show, I won't... okay I'll stop being lame. Look, LOST invaded our every waking thoughts (err..?) because of how wildly different it was than anything else on TV. It had mystery, mystery, Dharma beer, smoke monsters, and--most important to me, although many of you will probably say \\"you're only just saying that to not feel like you were raped for 6 seasons\\"--deeply fascinating character arcs. What allowed it to transcend the sophomore curse was being different every year, making each season stand apart from the previous while maintaining a core identity throughout the entire run. It was always LOST, but it went from being a stranded-on-a-scary-island show to being a holy-what-the-F show (simply put, of course). So now that that's out of the way, here are my experiences with the box set.<br /><br />The box itself is as massive as all the other reviews have made it out to be. Do you have a PS3 slim? The LOST box set is bigger than that (if I had to guess, I'd say maybe 15% bigger but who knows). Take all the guts out of the LOST box and you could fit your PS3 inside the box. If you don't have a PS3 slim, then I'm sorry I don't have a measuring tape within my reach. The upside to the massive box: it stands out. It has cool art. It's detailed--at this size it'd have to be so you know it's worth your money. The downside is, of course, that it won't fit on your standard shelf (probably--it doesn't fit on mine). So it'll have to go somewhere out in the \\"open\\" and you're pretty much forced to show it off. If you don't like that idea, you can always get a disc-gear to store the discs and just put the box in the closet, but...<br /><br />WHY would you want to hide this box?? You take off the lid and it's like a treasure chest. You have your episode guide, which to me is underwhelming--it's dark, brief, very few pictures, and doesn't list the bonus material. You pull that out and you have the actual BD sets which come in a box probably 12 x 7 (or something). Within that box are 6 slim cardboard foldouts, each with discs in disc-slots. YUCK. I hate this method of storage, which is why I store my discs elsewhere--more on that later. (I still display the case on my out-in-the-open shelf because it is that cool looking.) But there's more! On either side of where the BD box is stored, there are side storage areas. On the one side you will find game pieces for the game that Jacob and his brother played, as well as an Ankh. On the other side you'll find a Dharma blacklight and an old-looking letter, ala Richard Alpert. Yeah they're just trinkets and probably aren't worth a dime, but they're cool! What's really cool about the box though is the underside of the lid which is a raised map of the Island. Finally, the glyphs (or whatever they are) around the edges of the box make it look like an old tomb of sorts, something that could have been buried in the island somewhere.<br /><br />Enough about the box. You don't care about the box probably, maybe. Maybe you do. I'd talk about it more but...<br /><br />The bonus disc has a couple very cool features but I almost hate to talk about it because that's against the nature of the show! It's hidden (of course, and quite cleverly) so that's all I'll say. It's worth it--it's not enough to justify selling off your season sets and getting this box set, but it's definitely cool. If you're in that boat, try to find a friend who has the complete series set.<br /><br />My only genuine complaint, honest to goodness, comes from the cardboard-slot disc storage. Luckily for me, only one of the discs was damaged. Season 1 disc 2 had problems on 2 episodes. You have a couple routes to take if this happens to you. 1) Contact Amazon for a replacement set. I didn'twant to take this route, because what if the replacement ended up having 2 bad discs? Forget that. 2) Contact Disney (contactus@disneystudiohelp.com) and they're very cool, although slow (roughly a month), to replace your disc at no charge. So that's why I rated 4-stars. Even though I got my problem disc replaced, I still don't like the slot-storage method!<br /><br />Overall I'm really pleased with this set. The show looks fantastic on BD and it was nice to re-watch the series marathon-style. The mysteries of course are fantastic, but the depth of the character arcs make LOST a show that you can watch numerous times and still care about.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think that this game is one of the funnest games I have played everyone will love this game like I said it's one of the funnest games I have played.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|keeps you wanting more. some are hard but most are easy and fun. A great game for class or long trips. It took me a while to beat some games.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is different and fun... personally I love it. it's new a so cool... plus I'm amazing at it:)lol
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I have been looking at this one for a while, and finally decided to get it. I wanted it for the fact that the Kindle Fire locks in, with the one that I had from my previous Kindle, I was always afraid it would fall out because it wasn't made to fit in there properly. Feel better when I read, if I move around, my Kindle won't fall out.<br /><br />I only gave it 4.5 stars because I don't like that it doesn't sit back properly, I really wanted something that I could prop up and read when I was at a desk or something, and while this one does it, it doesn't do it completely the way that I would have wanted, not as sturdy.<br /><br />Overall, would I recommend this product, yes, because I feel that it is a good product to protect your Kindle Fire.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|LOVED THE MOVIE - LOVED THE MUSIC.  THIS IS PURE SLACK KEY AND FALSETTO.  GABBY PAHINUI IS WONDERFUL AS ALWAYS.  THEY PICKED THE PERFECT MUSIC FOR THE MOVIE.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun game, good time waster. I would recommend this game; it is simple and can be somewhat difficult as the levels increase.
B0060FXBNM|1.0|The first movie was merely bad: awful script, terrible acting, and mind-numbing plot. It's a Michael Bay movie so it's literally nothing but pretty explosions. There's no real exposition, no characters, and the end result is actually more one-dimensional than the original cartoon!  The sequels were worse - a cash-grab where the producers went through the motions again.
0767836324|5.0|This movie gets a lot of bad press for some reason, but I enjoyed it. Dustin Hoffman plays a fantastic Hook. Despite what people say, Julia Roberts does make a great Tinker Bell. I suggest to anyone who wants a live action Peter Pan marathon to start with Peter Pan (the one made in 2003) and then watch Hook. It's a great set up.
B001HNE3NO|3.0|Sarah's Key is a novel of two intertwined stories that are both set in Paris but separated by 60 years. We first meet a girl in 1942. She is young, naive, and full of life. And sadly, just about to be arrested, detained, and deported for being Jewish in a city occupied by Nazi Germany. Next we meet a middle-aged woman in 2002. Although she has married a Frenchman, bore his child, and lived in Paris for 20 some years, she remains an outsider, forever labeled as \\"l'Americaine\\". The two stories are told in alternating chapters until they meet and become one.<br /><br />The story of the young girl is an emotional, heart-wrenching portrayal of the 1942 V&eacute;lodrome d'Hiver roundup of the Jews living in Paris, who were ultimately sent to their deaths at Auschwitz. The topic alone demands your sympathy and tears. And as if that isn't enough, the author tells the story from the perspective of a young girl. With such ingredients, it's impossible not to be moved even if the language is simple and plain.<br /><br />In stark contrast to the 1942 story is the one of a middle-aged American journalist living in Paris in 2002. Unfortunately, her story is bland, banal, and boring. She is assigned to write an article about the V&eacute;lodrome d'Hiver Roundup for its 60th commemoration. Obsessed by what she finds, she digs deeper and deeper into its history until she finds a personal connection and becomes haunted by it.<br /><br />It is difficult to rate this book because of my opposing opinions about the two intertwined stories. One is a wonderfully interesting story that is easy to read, while the other is beyond boring, predictable, and unrealistic. One character is vivid, likable, and tugged at your heart strings. The other is dull, and well, frankly, I just couldn't stand her. Overall, four stars for the 1942 story and two stars for the 2002 story.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I was unable to use this app when I needed it most; in church. In my church we do not have Internet access, and so I found downloading a free Bible as a book much more helpful.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is so fun because it makes you work to get new games and its just sooooooo fun!! it has not just 101 games but 117 because it adds 16 ore why I don't know but I thinkits pretty clever
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i love the game i can play it for hours they have a lot of diffrent types of game for all types of people
B0063GORYU|5.0|I absolutely love this app.  I can't stop playing sometimes, and it gets me in trouble.  Beautiful graphics, nice on the eyes, and of course, very, very, fun.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its fun but challenging and I like how every day that you come in you get extra points. this game is awesome.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|passes time when bored - several different games to choose from - if u cant pass one u can pass another
B003L77FYS|5.0|I love the TV show, but often wish I could watch it at my leisure.  Buying the DVD's enables me to do that.  I watch them while I'm sewing or doing crafts and even though I've seen the episodes on TV originally, there are always little bits and pieces I might have missed the first time around that I get watching them on DVD.  I will be getting the next series when it comes out as well.
B003L77FYS|5.0|There aren't many shows on TV anymore that a family (say above age 10) can sit around and watch. I thoroughly enjoyed the third season of Castle. Some of the shows were particularly great, like the one that the entire crew breaks out in song at the end. Even Beckett. Very cool. There were a couple of episodes that were unnecessarily dark, but overall, it was very good.
B003VS0CXI|5.0|I bought this for my daughter who loves Mary Poppins. Thought I would try to show her another Dick Van Dyke movie that I remembered from childhood. By the end, she was singing all of the songs and thoroughly enjoyed it. I was happy to find a family friendly movie that I didn't have to worry about and look forward to family movie night with this one again!
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|I'm fascinated, even though there are an overwhelming number of viewers who enjoyed this movie, there are quit a number who rated it with one or two stars.  Woody's worst.  Horrible acting.  Boring.  No comedy.  So how is it that one who does not like Woody Allen films found this enchantingly entertaining?  It was a charming journey through allusions of various types which held very subtle humor that would certainly be lost on those who are not students of art and music and literature and history.  The acting is a recently employed style that certain movies use to capture an element of spontaneous realism as opposed to the super-polished Hollywood perfection that has spoiled us.  It's like eavesdropping on the imperfections of humanity.  It works for the right movie and Midnight in Paris is one of them.  I'm also wondering if it's possible that those of us who enjoyed this movie are also those who have often contemplated having been born in the wrong period of history?  Perhaps we have an affinity with that facet of imagination, but that is another discussion entirely.  I'm curious, how many of us have watched Gad Elmalch movies???  ONLY Gad could end up in the period of history in which he did!  That was hilarious.  But you would have to watch Gad's movies to get it.  Anyway, whether we loved the movie or hated it, I hope all of us at some point in life find our walk in the rain...
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Not exactly the Atari arcade game, but a fun time no doubt, and also pretty addictive.  Sound effects are nice, graphics are smooth.  No problems with app.
0380715430|4.0|...and nobody is better qualified to find and appreciate its funnier points than humorist Bill Bryson. The book starts out with an organized, historical, reportorial approach, with the development of all language, and then from Anglo-Saxon to modern English. But pretty soon, you find yourself laughing out loud at the sheer silliness of some words, spellings, usages, pronunciations, expressions, and names. If you laugh about the fact that Cholmondeston is pronounced \\"Chumson,\\" this book is definitely for you.  I'd recommend this book for anybody, but especially for...  Writers, editors and lawyers  People who like Scrabble or Words With Friends  People who loved The Elements of Style (Strunk & White) and Eats, Shoots and Leaves (Lynne Truss)  People who find the subjunctive picturesque (\\"I want that you should go do this\\")  I'd have rated the book 5 stars, except that I found the final chapter (The Future of English) a little sad. But what the heck! You can skip the last chapter!
B001QUL73W|1.0|This NAXOS recording has atrocious signal to sound ratio.  You have to raise your amplifier WAY UP, far beyond any other disc, to listen.  At the minimum, creates disturbing hum.  Leave your amp on that volume setting, and the next disc will blow out your speakers.  DANGER;  STAY AWAY FROM THIS DISC.
0060873027|5.0|I started reading this book, not sure what to expect but this actually emcompased the elements that got me reading Jurassic Park.  It was well paced, got the readers attention and ten times better than his his few books.  I think that you should read it and wouldn't be surprised if there is a sequel or movie deal in the works for this
B005HI4LLY|5.0|Easily one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I love the switch of college kids/hillbillies. Definitely worth buying! Amazon was great, shipping was quick even with the snowstorm!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app! With so many versions of the Bible available at your fingertips it makes studying the Bible so easy. I love that I can highlight in any color I want; I can use individual colors for various doctrinal studies! Note taking is a cinch, and you can choose to share your notes with others, or keep them private. I also love that there are so many various books, devotionals, and other study materials available - for free!!! The reminders in the various plans are a huge help if you are trying to study every day...if you do get behind it is do unbelievably easy to catch up!! This app has been a major blessing to me and has really helped me to spend more time in the Word. What a blessing!!
032147404X|5.0|Please excuse me for the lame, fake title as this is how this book begins on the first 6 pages, which was full of (lame) jokes.<br /><br />However, the real good stuff starts right after (be forewarned that the author would continue to throw a few more lame jokes out of total surprise). The book provides excellent advice on practical photo shooting techniques (and yet not too technical) in an easy to understand context. Each page of the book provides a particular technique over a broad category of photo shooting activities (eg flowers, weddings, landscapes, sports, travel/city shots, and people). An example photo is also shown on the top of each page to demonstrate the idea.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book for learning basic photography techniques.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I have to disagree with some of the other reviews, this app works really well on my kindle fire, and you can find me playing it often.
B006QVRVJK|5.0|If you don't like arthouse \\"talky\\" films (the French are very good at this--especially Eric Rohmer) then I advise you to stay as far away as you can from CARNAGE.  However, if you enjoy people talking about everyday things and slowly revealing their repressed inner souls--then go see this film! I think it's one of the best films I have seen in 2011 and that includes SOURCE CODE, MIDNIGHT IN PARIS, MONEYBALL, THE DESCENDANTS, BRIDESMAIDS, WAR HORSE, THE SEPARATION, IDES OF MARCH, and TREE OF LIFE.
0061478784|5.0|It would appear the Kindle version of this book is no more:( I am a bit miffed to say the least!  I had pulled the Kindle sample of this book before Thanksgiving, but it now has vanished!  I finally got around to reading it this week, got to the end of the sample, clicked on the link to buy the book; then was told that it no longer exists!?  I am not sure what to do, I started reading it in a digital format, but now nobody has it (not even Barnes and Noble).  Am I supposed to move backward and buy the paperback?  Aside from that, from what I was able to read, it is an enchanting story that helps clarify many points that were missing from Hayao Miyazaki's interpretation of the work.  I wish I could say more, but I am unable to finish reading this unless I feel like toting around an actual book; a \\"novel\\" idea in this world of digital readers.  I will check back later in hopes that it reappears.
B00007KWHG|5.0|Loved all the songs. It was exactly what I wanted.  I love just singing along with them and reliving all those happy times when their music came out.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app makes for awesome Bible studies and devotionals. I love it so much!You definitely need to get this app.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Lots of fun on my kindle fire. Great graphics and easy to use. I can't put it down! My only complaint is the amount of points required to get all 117 games, seems a little high.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|controls very laggy and games get boring I like the concept of having to earn points to unlock new games but eventually you end up having to play the same game 40 times just to get enough points!!!!!
B00005ASHM|5.0|The Beatles had over 100 hits, but Pet Sounds was the best album of the Sixties.  Astonishing that Brian Wilson was so young at the time.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|great game but it is a little hard when you get to the very end I cant get past it
B006WPSQVC|5.0|This movie hit the nail on the head for our men as foundations of the family.  The woman's role has always been to raise the children but children NEED their dads as well.  This movie pointed out a lot of valuable points in making a decision, daring to change a life long trend, and stepping up to the plate instead of singing Lou Rawls tune woulda, coulda, shoulda.  It's not too late to make a decision to be that father the children need.  I encourage men, women, and children to watch this movie and discuss how each one can make a change for better.  God said in Matthew chapter 6, you can't serve Him and money.  The family is ordained and blessed by God and He is a primary need in our life in order to make it through every situation and providing for all our needs.  Be bless as you watch this movie.

B0025UHKNS|4.0|The watch is a great asset to my running workouts. The only thing I would change would be to make the display a little larger. If you're not running in  strong daylight it can be difficult to read. My main problem is that it will not connect to my PC. I get an error message saying that I am using an unsupported OS version. My computer uses Windows 7. I tried to run it with service pack 2, service pack 2, and windows 7 with no luck. I tried contacting  Garmin customer support, but all they told me was to use service pack 3. So I'm basically at a stopping point. If anybody has any other suggestions I would  be grateful.
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|This, this is pathetic!  Not only does it lag due to ads, but the app Icon is still the snow theme!  This is in dire need of bug fixes!  Maybe not even worth free................
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Works great on galaxy Nexus ics... Very customizable.... Also very pretty and the widgets are great... Amazon sucks so much
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Awesome game to pass time, very addictive. Wish there were more upgrades but besides that it's a solid fun game. The farthest I've gotten is level 22.
B003297I1U|5.0|It is a good toy for my two boys, six and two yrs old, they love it. It has a lot of fun and movable parts. My boys have several Bruder, this is the best one they have. It is in solid build, high quality and I beleived this toy designers really deep think into each parts to make it very nice. Recommend.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I have really enjoyed this version on my Kindle more than on my computer because of the tap screen.  I play  while I hold on calls for work.  Real enjoyable.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this same app each day on my android phone. I was glad to download it for my kindle. So easy to use. All the Bible versions at my finger tips. Great for my Bible study.

B006SV2LWA|5.0|A really scientifically accurate flick.<br /><br />That being said, when I saw it, the next person who sneezed made me PARANOID.<br /><br />-r.c.
0316098329|5.0|Reading this book, I found myself contemplating what it would be like to be trapped inside a small room for the first 5 years of my life.  Emma Donoghue does an incredible job at taking the reader inside that life.  From the beginning, I found myself contemplating the implications of Jack's escape into the world.  While Ma was an important character in the book, the best parts of the book came from Jack's exploration of \\"outside\\".<br /><br />Some might be put off by the writing style- it is written as if Jack (a 5 year old) is narrating. I worried about that, but almost instantly was drawn into the story.  This is a very important book- both dense and compelling.
B0001I561E|3.0|I searched for a blu ray when looking for this movie - guess they're not available. Should have known since it didn't specify on the details but was keeping my fingers crossed since it said it was a two-disc set and cost $50. In the end, I was wrong. Lesson learned: wait. $50 for a Disney DVD is way too much, especially since I got lion king and beauty and the beast, both blu ray and dvd combos, for a combined total of what I paid for just Aladdin DVDs. It was a requested Xmas present so I thought I was doing a good thing. At the end of the day, I think my money would have been better spent elsewhere.
B004LWZW4M|1.0|In other words, I ordered the dvd of this movie, and received it, but it was sent to me with a message:<br />\\"Not formatted for this region\\"; therefore, I have never seen it...
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the variety of games that there is to chose from. I also like that you unlock the games. I do not enjoy the adds coming at random moments.
B0058VW36U|5.0|The game cut the rope is fun and challenging. It is educational by using logic. I play this game all the time, and I sometimes get in trouble from playing it too often
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am not usually one to read science fiction or fantasy, but my 20 year old daughter talked me into reading this series, and I will say I enjoyed it. The first book had me hooked from the first page and I found it a quick enjoyable read. Collins has actually written a very lengthy book and broken it down into 3 novels. Much less intimidating, especially for younger readers. Personally, by the third book I was getting a little tired of the story, but I had to finish it to see what happened.  I think that this is a superb book for young adults. It has action, and twists and turns to keep up the interest, a clean, platonic love triangle (except for some kissing) for the romantics, and characters faced with dilemmas to resolve. The book does a good job of character developement and there are many lessons that can be learned about relationships, good and evil, and that success doesn't always solve your problems. If I were to rate this series on my own opinion I would give it a 4, simply because I did get tired of the story, but then again it wasn't written for me, it was written for young adults and for them it is definitely a 5.
0312576463|4.0|Now, I'm only 21 years old and likely don't understand the complexities of marriage that Franzen may or may not have embodied in the book, but I really enjoyed reading this.  Franzen has an excellent writing style and takes us through each character in a non-traditional fashion.<br /><br />I found the story to be compelling and relevant, especially with the son's involvement in government contracting and the husband's involvement in the non-profit world.  The characters were all very interesting, and impossible to label.  While long, I found this book to be incredibly readable and an excellent work of fiction.
B005C9YZIW|5.0|Most would have seen this on TV in parts. This is a great collection particularly in Bluray. There are a lot of extra footage and the Video is sharp. I have since seen some episodes few times over as a family.  A must have !

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I probably don't need to add another 5-star review for this book, but I'm going to anyway! I couldn't put it down, and was bummed out when I finished it last night only because I already found myself wanting more! I actually purchased the next two books prior to finishing this one, that's how much I enjoyed reading it. If you like a good survival story with great characters, world, everything; read this book. Unless your just weird or can't stomach a little violence, chances are you won't be disappointed!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|download :) this game is fun and not complex. Great for all ages! easy goals to meet and great mini games.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This app works great. It is really easy to use. Great original game to help pass time while waiting at Dr appts or wherever!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This game is definitely not something you can play while being distracted.  If I had one request, it would be to make it a bit more responsive. As the levels get higher, it seemed like my missles didn't respond as quickly. YMMV.  Samsung Galaxy S
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Best Bible App out. Have it on both my Kindle Fire and Evo. Multiple translations, easy search, note keeping, and it even reads aloud to you.  Only caveat is you must have a wi-fi or cell connection because it is so robust. Incredible and still getting better.  -Ken
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is not an easy workout, but great results don't come without a little pain. I was very impressed by how it worked my entire body without requiring a lot of equipment. (I recommend buying a pair of light weights to use during this workout.) The workout simultaneously teaches two intensity levels, which helps beginners get started while still challenging more advanced exercisers.
B004A7UVLC|5.0|Amazing actors.  You forget where you are.  I don't like many murder mysteries, but this one has such nuance it's more about human nature than just gore or thrill seeking.  Leaves a smile on your face.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is nearly perfect for my touchpad. I am using it daily. Not sure how I lived without it to be honest.
1572816112|5.0|The imagery is beautiful and meaningful. However I wound't recommend them for someone who has never played the tarot before because they can be hard to interpret. Other then that they are a wonderful set.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|one of the better missle commands I've played, worth more than the 99 cents that it demands. Being able to upgrade your defenses and rebuild your buildings, puts this game above the rest.
B000UCIALE|5.0|The Bourne Identity is THE BEST BOOK that I have ever read.  From the first page to the last there is no other book that can match it in depth and non stop action.  The movie cannot compare and in my opinion is but a meer shadow of the true story of Jason Bourne.  Many years ago I had read Ludnum's \\"The Materase Circle\\"  and thought that it was the best spy vs spy book of all time.  I had heard on the Bourne Identity, but scoffed at the idea that it could be as good.  When I got TBI I could not put it down and read it in a day.  Since then I've reread it probably 20 times and still would rather read it again that read most other books.  I have(had) 3 copies. Do yourself a favor and buy it, but only if you have a day or two to devote to it because you probably will not get anything else done.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the variety of games that this app offers. the only thing I don't really like is that you have to play the games multiple times in order to get enough points to unlock more games.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Entertaining games...the games start to require more points to unlock though. Other than that I like this app.  More games, less storage space.
0374275637|5.0|Excellent!  I'm on my third reading - this is a book I'll come back to many times.  So far, I've given 12 copies to family and friends.
B006ZBRMOU|5.0|There are so many times when the \\"Fairytale\\" ends with \\"happily ever after\\"... and of course as an audience, we are left to dream that things are wonderful between our enchanted couple. \\"Fifty Shades Freed\\", took us beyond the wedding and the \\"Honeymoon\\" period and into the life of our beloved Christian and Ana. I found myself anxious going into \\"Freed\\", fearing something bad would happen to Christian and/or Ana.  What I found inside the pages of this book (Kindle..whatever) was an incredible story of fear, strength and ultimately love of these two people for not only each other but for those who share their world.  James found a way to create a story (three actually) where the reader is able fall in love simultaneously with Ana (without thinking that she is allowing herself to be abused by Christian)  and with Christian (without thinking he is an abusive a*s). James created charecters that were each flawed, however, they were aware of their flaws which, to this reader, made them human.  Ana, while young, showed amazing strength in trying to keep true to herself while still trying to reach out to Christian to give him the unconditional love that she knows he needs.  Christian, while insecure to a fault, does try to give Ana some degree of space even though it causes him physical pain.  I loved each and every word written to all three books.  I will be re-reading them again and again. I look forward to reading more from E.L James in the future.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I found this game very enlightening and fun. So many different puzzles to play and only one way to win each puzzle. This is one of my better games that I have on my Kindle Fire.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Great book.  I immediately began spreading this book around the family.  I wish I had understood or known about these concepts in school.  I believe this will change how I eat for a long time.
0525478817|5.0|Ever stay up to 2am sobbing and laughing your way through a novel? I feel emotionally drained and spiritually revitalized. Oh the power of well crafted literature. Thank you John Green for \\"The fault in our stars\\"
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love that it randomly choses a solitaire game for me to play. It keeps me interested, and it's easy to pick up and play when I'm bored.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Use it every day in my quiet time.  It's devotionals &amp; Bibles are fantastic.  Love the ability to listen and/or read.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|I bought this movie for my daughter for Christmas.  I received it on time.  My daughter love, love, loves this movie.  Thanks!
B005NPLXJ4|3.0|You know, I'm kinda of torn with this release. I mean when I first heard the opening track I started laughing. But, the more I listen to it the better it gets. The music is actually really good, but Lou's voice really doesn't blend well with this band. But, then again the music is really good. Over all a failed effort, but it's not terrible like people are saying. During the songs I really wanted James to take over the vocals instead of Lou. Lou's voice is an acquired taste.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|fun game, great use of a tablet.  but the game was too easy.  by night 25 I maxed my upgrades and just didn't have a worry at all about losing.  kick up the difficulty and it would be near-perfect.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I recently have owned the Soundfly Aux MP3 Player. I was going to by its cheaper version but I read a review on Amazon that the additional money would be worth it. My last FM transmitter worked but you could tell it was not coming from the stereo in the car and white noise abounded. After setting it up I played it and was amazed at how clear it was. Later when I was out with my wife and daughter I asked how they liked the music, then quickly explained it was coming from a Transmitter and was not a CD or the radio. I also love the options of setting up different SD cards to be filled with music and grabbed and used on long trips. Nothing is worse then the same set of CD being played over and over. I can also set SD cards up of my favorite messages from different Pastors and listen on the way to work. I hope this holds up.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I was looking for a weather app that offered radar, and pleased to find this app. Not only radar, burnished app also offers very accurate forecasts and it works great and looks great on my kindle fire. I highly recommend this weather app!!!
B004EF6632|5.0|I've seen this production countless times, and I have to say it has taken the number one spot on my favorite movies list (kicking BBC's Pride and Prejudice to number two). The lead actors have great chemistry, and the story has a bit of everything: romance, history, and excitement. I highly recommend this series!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|yep,you have to unlock new games just like description States. However it's super fun! These are<br />mini games like an airhockey type to brainteasers &amp; puzzle type games&amp; they have replay value as well!
0465011047|5.0|Wow.  Just...wow.  This book is one of the most intense books I have ever read, and one of the very few non-fiction/memoir type books that I've ever picked up willingly.  I've been more and more curious about North Korea since the death of Kim Jong-il in December 2011.  I started by reading new articles and Wikipedia articles, and it was through one of those Wiki articles that I discovered this book.  My college campus library didn't have it (a real shocker for me), and I finally found it after visiting three bookstores (I couldn't wait for it to be shipped in if I ordered it online; I wanted to read it RIGHT THEN).  I bought the last copy, and it was the best $18 I've ever spent.  I could not put this book down.  While not as graphic as I expected it to be (probably a good thing for those who are weak-stomached), it was still horrific to read what Kang Chol-Hwan and his family went through in the Yodok camp; horrific to read about the living conditions and about the public executions that took place there.  I don't know how he managed to survive all of those horrible things that took place in that camp.  I could never imagine a life that horrible (of course, here I sit in my warm home in the United States, rather than a close-quarters apartment or such under constant surveillance in North Korea).  I truly feel sorry for the people there, while at the same time truly fascinated by the cult of personality in which they live.  This book was absolutely heart-wrenching; I have no doubt in my mind that I will pick it up again.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is even remotely curious about North Korea and/or its culture and people.  Insider accounts are probably some of the best, most accurate accounts you could possibly get coming from a closed country such as North Korea.  I have already lined up another prisoner memoir, Eyes of the Tailless Animals to read, as well as Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader.  I never thought that I would be interested in North Korea, but perhaps the reason it's so interesting to me (and I'm sure others), is because, according to Kang and other citizens from there and tourists that have visited there, it is so different from the world I live in.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|An engaging interweaving of two of my favorite fascinations, the Kennedy assassination and Stephen King.  Don't think I turned on my TV for a week.  Greatly enjoyed it from cover to cover.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|these mini games are so much fun and very very addicting! everyone should try this app! it lasts a long time and never gets old!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Hell of a game. Definerly my favorite game on here right now.<br />Its incredibly fun and I strongly reccomend downloading this game
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is cool. First you start with 9 games then you earn coins to unlock more games. You can also purchase coins using a credit card. You can also earn coins for free by doing some things. Once you do some things, you earn coins.
0545265355|4.0|Hello, I was hesitant to read these books because they are geared toward teen girls and young adults. However, I got hooked. I loved the first two books, but didn't like the third, Mockingjay.  Mockingjay felt too rushed. Some story lines were too short.  I didn't like how District 13 leaders were characterized. I was hoping for more comraderie.  I didn't like how Katniss continued to not show any feelings and have a heart. She was made out to be too hard hearted.  I didn't like them killing of Finnick.  I didn't like how they just left Gale blowing in the wind.  and I thought the description of the Capitol and what happened there to be a bit over the top. Such as the road opening up. I can accept the mutant mutts more than that.  I loved her shooting Coin, but what happened right afterward was a shame. I wanted Katniss to be a hero, not a junky gone mad.  I hope if the movies get to the third book, that they do a bit of re-writing.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|More translations than you could possibly ever need with an extremely intuitive User interface.  Absolutely one of the best apps out there.
B001UDPAB0|5.0|If you're looking for the Ocean's 11 DVD set then this is what you want. Enough said. Even comes with the set holder that's in the picture.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Lots of games and lots of fun. The wide selection of games allows for a game for anyone, especially people who likes simple yet difficult games.
B006GRBK4G|5.0|Fabulous!  I have been following Motogp for about 10 years.  I ride track days on my R6.  This video really captures what it feels like to be around motorcycle racing and into the lives of those who race.  The commentary and cinematography are excellent!  The movie is mostly about Rossi, but you can't blame them...
B0054JZC6E|3.0|good games but takes to long to collect coins to unlock games. would be better if all games unlocked right away.
0060574216|5.0|This is one of the most important books I have ever read. It succintly puts together the reasons why men (all men) are different from women (all women); why this creates problems of communication in a couple; and what to do about it. I found it fascinating reading and illuminating for its insights. This is a summary table I have written based on the book (sorry it does not appear as a table here because no html is allowed by Amazon. I think it summarizes the main thrust of the argument Gray makes and is spelled out  in the video by Paul Dewandre (in French) Les hommes viennent de Mars, les femmes de Venus.<br /><br />Man:<br />1) values competence,<br />2) reasons in sequential mode,<br />3) wants to resolve a problem alone,<br />4) is rational,<br />5) needs trust,<br />6) needs appreciation<br />7) is like a dolphin, wants a fish when he gets something done<br /><br />Woman:<br />1) values relationship,<br />2) can do multi-tasking,<br />3) wants to talk about a problem,<br />4) is emotional,<br />5) needs attention,<br />6) needs understanding,<br />7) is like a garden, wants to be mantained every day no matter what.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game really makes me think. It is challenging but still loads of fun. I am surprised it is free.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|very addictive and fun.  anyone know can you upgrade past level 5? It is a repetitive game but so was the original. highly recommend
0553384775|4.0|OK- so the author is completely in love with himself and the story is confusing at times with all the characters and nicknames but<br />it is still an entertaining read.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|l really like this game games my fab is serpeant but i takes awhile to get points for new gmes so
B005P89F1C|1.0|This is so bad, I only got it for a gag gift. There is no reason to buy this. I bought it for a white elephant party, and they hated it. Job well done.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love this app I use it every day. I never leave home without it. it is so inspiring, and I read it daily.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Use it every morning to plan my wardrobe. Very accurate!  Tried other apps but found I liked this one best. Even has the radar maps.
0553386794|5.0|An epic start to a grand fantasy series!<br /><br />The first in the series introduces the major players -- the Starks, The Lannisters, the Targaryens -- and the beginnings of political unrest that will result in war. Backstabbing, unexpected alliances, and heroic deeds and misdeeds! And winter is coming.<br /><br />If you've watched the show, it follows this first book pretty closely. I can't wait to crack open book two and find out what happens next! The creatures and legends from beyond the wall intrigue me just as much as all the politics (and they delve a bit more into that aspect in the books than they do in the show). Otherwise, I love both the book and the adaptation and highly recommend both to even fringe fantasy fans.
B005FMZX9Q|5.0|I am very happy for my choice made, the clock is very nice and I got a very good price and I was delivered in a very short time
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Absolutely amazing. This app works wondrously well, and I highly recommend it. It's very useful in controlling your computers remotely, and there really isn't much lag in the process. I used this from both a phone and a tablet, and the interfaces are great, easy to understand, and effective. Incredible app!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Nice little game. Reminiscent of the arcade game.  Nice to build buildings back up.  Next, needs multiple missile silos.  Still fun.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a fun game to play when you have nothing to do. but it takes a while to unlock a new game.
B003Y5H54W|5.0|I love this movie and I can't wait to see the other \\"real life\\" adaptations of the other fairy tales.

1563899426|1.0|I wanted to like this series and I was intrigued by the idea of storybook characters living among us without our knowledge  for centuries. I did admire the artwork in these graphic novels, which is the only positive thing that I can say about them. The characters are not only shallow, they are offensive. Women are treated like second class citizens. Willingham is an ultra conservative hawk and it shows. Bigby Wolf is an overbearing jerk. Is there anything he can't do? The only power Willingham hasn't given him is the ability to fly like Superman. In all the centuries that he has been alive did it never occur to anyone to shoot him with a silver bullet? Beside, supposedly Fables can ncver die so where is the drama or risk to them? Even though they live in our world they almost never interact with us \\"mundies\\" who they regard as inferior beings. Wouldn't at least some of them developed relationships with humans over the years?This is a really strange attitude to take considering that without our world to escape to they would have all been destroyed by the Adversary. They also seem to be very dumb even though they have lived for centuries. They are in awe of our science and technology and weapons because in their worlds they have never progressed much beyond the Middle Ages. I kept hoping that they would go home to their Fable worlds and leave us alone. Also, if they have been around for so long why aren't they all wealthy? As I said, dumb. Women are basiclly here only as sex objects for the men. Snow White isn't bothered at all by the fact that Bigby is really a wolf in human form and that he has killed and eaten hundreds of innocent people because, well, he signed an amnesty agreement that made it all OK.  Many of the other characters are just as bad , but apparenly Willingham has no problem with this as long as they sign a piece of paper. Gee, I guess we can let all the serial killer ot of jail if they just sign an amesty agreement right? At least the artwork is good. This could have been a good series if it had been thought out more and not just tried to appeal to pre-adolescent boys.
B0051MKMNC|1.0|Studios have decided that you MUST watch fifteen minutes of previews in order to watch this blu ray. Don't support this practice by purchasing this movie. Torrent it instead.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game!!!!my sisters have it on their ipods and I just had to download it .this game is worth 0.99
B00079HZUM|5.0|This is one of my favorite films!!  The scene at the end where they recreate Desdemona's death scene in Othello is one of the best performances of that scene ever filmed! If you love historical period peices or theater history, you MUST see this film.  Great acting by all involved!  Wonderful performances!!I don't know how the Academy Awards missed this one. (Film critics don't agree with me. Their loss, frankly.)
1451627289|5.0|Once again, Stephen King just amazes me with his imagination and skill. The concept of the parallel universe and going back in time has of course been addressed by authors in the past (notably Time and Again, which King references in his notes).  However, the idea of changing history by going back in time has never been applied to such a pivotal event as the assassination of JFK.  This story is told so deftly and the subplots that are interwoven with the main story line are just as intriguing.  It all builds to a crescendo, and what made it SO much fun to read is that I really couldn't guess the outcome!  Fantastic read! Don't miss it!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|nice. game good enough very fun and challenging game but I'm trying to beat all of them.  easy least lemon squeezy
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Has fun games. Gets a little boring once you complete the games and still need more points to open the next game. But it fills the time!
B0063IH60K|5.0|very good game. quite addictive. I really love the winning deal option. would definitely recommend this game. very fun for fans of solitaire.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I loved angry birds so I tried angry birds seasons. It is just as good as the normal angry birds we all know and love. So get it.
B003NWS5AO|5.0|Robert Plant continues to amaze! After Led Zeppelin, it would be hard to imagine what else he could do.  Then, a couple of years ago he teamed up with Alison Kraus for the beautiful \\"Raising Sand\\" CD.  Now, Band of Joy, which includes Patti Griffin and a whole lot of other amazing musicians, shows everyone that Robert Plant still has it! His voice sounds fantastic and the entire band is so talented.  I would recommend this CD highly.
B001HNE3NO|3.0|The book starts out with the kind of stark, horrific picture of brutality against Jews in World War Two France that can't help but rivet you, especially as it's told from the point of view of a young, innocent girl. That part is very well done. The book does it's job of exposing the complicity of the French with the Nazis.   However, much of the book is about the journalist who exposes the past, and gets into her marital problems. That part was less interesting and vastly less compelling. I read it mostly to find out what happened to Sarah.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This movie is a Christmas classic. It never gets old! Great for getting in the holiday spirit. Chevy Chase at his best
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a basic game that anyone can play.  It has different modes which allows you to choose your difficulty level.  Great buy and value.
B00650SSWG|1.0|Stopped watching after 30 minutes. Would have stopped it earlier but gave it a chance. Acting seemed so forced and there was absolutely no chemistry. Don't waste your time or money - I wish I hadn't.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|fun games but not a lot available. u can buy more with points but then have to become a member to get more.
B00008GKEG|5.0|The anthology was amazing, informative and a gem in music history. I would recommend this to every Beatles fan and every music fan in general. This is one product that one day will be priceless and a  collectors item...
B001AW156U|1.0|This is my second PS3 Dualshock 3 L2 / R2 Trigger add-ons order from Gameseek.  The first set of L2 / R2 trigger controllers were 'as pictured' and stayed on my PS3 Dualshock 3 controller.  Truly appreciating the functionality of these Gioteck PS3 trigger add-ons I then ordered from Amazon, and from a different vendor, a second set of L2 / R2 trigger controllers from AFC Trident, which were quite inexpensive but NOT worth purchasing because they pop-off way too easily.  So, I re-ordered another set of these L2 / R2 trigger enhancements from Gameseek but Gameseek pulled a bait-and-switch on me and sent me a different type of trigger made by Orb, not the ones Gameseek pictures on it's Amazon screen, not the same ones they sent me my first order.  Although I have not tried to use these new Orb trigger add-ons, this set looks like the smaller and (probably) more-than-likely-to-pop-off trigger add-ons AFC Trident sent me, and this totally is a mis-representation of the product.  Shame on you Gameseek.  Shame on you.<br />Disgruntled and not happy about that,<br />Dennis \\"TheOZer\\" Osborne
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome game I love to play it all day nothing is better it makes me happy and I want to play play play.

B003Y5H5EW|5.0|\\"Awakening\\" picks up where \\"Evolution\\" left off. Alexander Corvinus is dead, and now no one is cleaning up after his offspring. Humans discover the existence of the immortals, and react in a predictably human fashion: they try to wipe them out.<br /><br />The film did a great job carrying on the story. Everything still makes sense, and none of the \\"rules\\" of the world are changed. Vampires still hate lycans, lycans still hate vampires. We just have a new dimension added -- humans hate vampires and lycans. The \\"mood\\" of the earlier films hasn't changed much here either...this is very much a dark, somber atmosphere. Michael is notably absent, but (don't worry!) it's handled well. The new characters fit nicely into the Underworld world, and no one seems out of place. The story itself was good, and they were careful to make sure that it continued everything we've seen in the first movies.<br /><br />The acting was all great, and Kate Beckinsdale did a(nother) superb job...she has a great way of conveying emotion with very understated expressions and tones.<br /><br />Another aspect that I liked about this film...up until this point, with two exceptions (Sonya and Celine), we've seen pretty much nothing but evil vampires; werewolves, by contrast, have grown vengeful, but are justified in their quest for vengeance. Lycans are \\"regular people\\" who have been changed, hunted and abused, but vampires are the abusers and hunters. There is nothing very likeable the vampires, with the exception of Sonya and Celine -- at best they have been happy to profit off other's misery, and, at worst, they contribute to it. Here we see more \\"human\\" vampires...not perfect, but not horribly evil either.<br /><br />All in all, 5/5 stars -- another great addition to the series.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|These are all in wide screen. For the money these are good and gaves you the whole collection.  Shipped very quickly and packaged well.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I think this app is a really good app for when your wondering what the weather is if your not around a Tv or a phone and yhu can just look on your kindle,tablet,opacity touch,etc.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I admit, when my sister and I watched this in the movie theater years ago, it was very slow in the beginning.  From the title of the movie to Chihiro first moving into a new town, the movie takes a dramatic effect after her and her family get lost.<br /><br />From there the story picks up and Chihiro learns so many things in this new world she's now faced being alone.  By end of the movie it's a very wild and happy ending yet somehow the movie makes you think and really does end with a refreshing feel.  It's not often many children's movie will make you feel this way nor want to replay the movie over and over.  I don't even know how many times we've watch Miyazaki's work.  A lot of Japanese anime's geared for children really stays at heart of children.  Disney probably would not have got the rights to sell them otherwise in the USA if that wasn't the case.<br /><br />I'll have to warn parents and anyone with small children that it may scare them a bit in certain scenes.  It's not so much of ghost or anything jumping at you in front the screen but some scenes can be dark and Miyazaki really tries to give that creepy feel while he comes back with something much better and happier.<br /><br />Another classic and excellent movie worth watching with anyone especially families.
B0068RHGJM|4.0|This is the first Nightwish album I heard, and it won't be the last (I have had a chance to hear a good amount of the others). I love that you hear of the orchestra in the last two albums. For a former marching band nerd like me, I love the orchestrated parts. The brass parts and the classic Disney-esque choir sound of Storytime always sends shivers up my spine.  Nightwish continues the path they are taking with Anette. Her voice is pretty and delicate, and they are doing amazing things with it. It's very hard to take a voice like hers and make it sound good with rock music. They deserve credit for what they do with her voice, and also Tarja's. In Scaretale, the singing style is similar to an awfully grating singing style that I heard before elsewhere. It felt like someone was stabbing my ears, and the style worked great in Scaretale.  I have this feeling that the direction is moving from a more operatic sound to sounds more inspired by the Celtic sound. They almost have to change, though, because it would hold everyone back if they stayed with making music around Tarja's voice. I also had this impression that strayed from rock, but listening to the songs again made me realize that they are using a lot of rock, but less metal than the usual Nightwish album.  I really like this album. I'm actually mixed between Anette and Tarja.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I purchased this item to charge my iPhone 4 while using the interface cable in my 2009 Maxima. It charges the phone perfectly and still sounds great.  It also works with my standard iPod.  The slim end works fine with my Otterbox case too.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is pretty good. some of the games I don't like but they have fun ones too. I think its funny when they give you extra points for being persistant at games your really bad at. lol.
0553805371|3.0|A very interesting viewpoint on how the world was created as well as where we could be going.  Having a science background would make it a lot easier to understand though.  Some concepts went over my head, but overall it was worth the time.  I may need to read it twice to fully understand it. I do think that religious people will have a problem with this publication as Stephen Hawking makes his atheism pretty apparent.  While I'm not an atheist (I am more agnostic and decide to live by the golden rule), I do see how it could be difficult to convince a religious individual since many theories over the course of history have been debunked and even the current theories that can't be tested could be debunked. I am still left wondering how does one *really* know, one way or the other? A 200-paged publication obviously will not have all of the answers.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I was at first skepic about this game mostly because of the calm and relaxing description.  I like more action and more noise in my games but the great reviews made me have to try this, and I am very glad that I did. The mood is very calming and zen like and it does in a way relax you. But the thing that I loved the most is the gameplay. It is very easy to pick up on and it can be quite easy.  It also makes you think about how to get around things and how to complete your objective in the least amount of moves. If your looking for a new game to play then you can't pass this one up, and at 99&cent; its a steal.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great classic game with nice graphics. Provides hints and guaranteed solvable or random deals. Very limited dismissable ads. Nicely done!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app will keep you entertained for hours and is good for long car rides I love this app I cant wait unroll I unlock all the games

B001WCN23W|5.0|With Mick Taylor playing lead guitar and Jimmy Miller, once again, producing, the Stones released one of rock history's best albums, \\"Sticky Fingers.\\"  It was one of a number of albums that the band released during what is known as the band's golden era, beginning with the release of the album, \\"Beggar's Banquet\\" with its infamous (and stirring) song, \\"Sympathy for the Devil.\\"  Throughout this period, Jimmy Miller continued to produce the band's music with stellar results, and unsurprisingly, the band released a string of exceptional albums, welcomed by both, fans and critics alike.  With the addition of Mick Taylor on guitar to replace the late Brian Jones, the band now had, for the first time in its history, a true lead guitarist and that made a big difference in the music the band recorded.  Mick Taylor had previously played with John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, a hotbed for some of rock's top talent.  Unlike songs for some of their previous albums, songs for this album were created and recorded while the band was on the road; it made a difference, and snippets of the band recording songs for this album had fortunately been preserved on the film, \\"Gimme Shelter\\", a film well worth seeing.  For instance, a week before the band appeared at the Altamont Speedway in California to give a free concert on the west coast, the band recorded for several days at a studio in Muscle Shoals, Alabama.  The band cut three songs: \\"Brown Sugar\\", \\"You Gotta Move\\", and \\"Wild Horses.\\"<br /><br />The album was released while the band was in the midst of its worldwide tour, and as often is the case in rock history, albums that were created while a band played on the road in the midst of a tour turned out to be notable, and at times, even exceptional, gems.  This album was just that--a masterpiece.  Each and every song on \\"Sticky Fingers\\" is worth a listen; the album produced a number of memorable tunes, prompting considerable FM-radio airplay at that time.  Some radio stations even went to the extent of playing each and every song from the album individually several times during the course of a given day, much to the delight of Stones' fans.  The album was that good.  Radio stations from coast-to-coast repeatedly played songs such as \\"Brown Sugar\\", \\"Bitch\\", \\"Sway\\", \\"Dead Flowers\\", and \\"Wild Horses.\\"  Upon the album's release, Stones' fans scooped up the album in droves to the point that, within a month, the album reached #1 status in the United States.  Naturally, the first single from the album, \\"Brown Sugar\\", was a huge hit, too, and it included another memorable song on its B-side that was not found on the album, \\"Let It Rock.\\"<br /><br />By this point in time in the band's history, the Stones had established themselves as a band worth seeing in concert.  Their previous album, \\"Get Yer Ya-Yas Out\\", a recording of the band when they played a couple of dates at Madison Square Garden in New York City in late 1969, and released in 1970, proved that the band lived up to the label, \\"World's Greatest Rock n' Roll Band.\\"  Needless to say, a proliferation of bootlegs of the band's concerts from this tour soon appeared in stores nationwide, and sales could not be overlooked, prompting the record company later to release the \\"official\\" said concert album in 1970.  One particular bootleg recording of a Stones' concert at that time made an exceptional splash; FM-radio stations coast-to-coast even began to play songs from this bootleg, something unprecedented.  Its sales reflected the bootleg's quick popularity; the album was entitled, \\"Liver Than You'll Ever Be\\", and it certainly left its mark in rock history.  And as a result, no longer was the focus for the band (and their career) on producing studio work alone; the band now had a second life, and a worthwhile purpose, too, so to speak, by taking their music on the road.  After all, the band now had a new member, an exceptionally versatile lead guitarist.  And, no longer would the band be competing with, andbe compared to, The Beatles.  A new era in rock had begun for them.<br /><br />It is important to mention here that the band's album, \\"Sticky Fingers\\", was the first release on their own label, Rolling Stones Records.  The band now finally had control over the music that the band would release on any given album, and at the same time, the band now finally had control over the art work that would grace the same.  In the past, control over the release of the band's music and also control over the art work that appeared on any given album were issues that oftentimes caused ongoing disputes between members of the band and record company executives.  At times, the band fought hard with record company executives over their work.  For instance, the band's proposal for the cover of their album, \\"Beggar's Banquet\\", was nixed by their label, and the album was ultimately released simply with an off-white cover and little else!  Coincidentally, and as luck would have it, the Beatles released their classic album, known as the \\"White Album\\", at about the same time.<br /><br />The cover to the album, \\"Sticky Fingers\\", by itself brought notable attention to it, too.  None other than Andy Warhol, the pop-art icon of the 1960s and a friend of the band, came up with the album's concept--a photograph of a male wearing a pair of tight-fitting jeans was to grace the album's entire cover, front and back!  In addition, a real zipper was embedded in the cover's artwork; the zipper actually worked.  It was so real and such a novel a concept that the cover created a sensation unparalleled in rock history.  Many fans were eager to buy the album simply for its unique cover, and the album's cover quickly became a conversation piece......  Ah, but the music inside delivered as well; it was sensational, too.be compared to, The Beatles.

B004Z4LVZK|4.0|I am a teenager who loves to read these sort of books, so I picked this up after I read the Hunger Games. I found it to be very interesting and suspenseful, but I have a few concerns.  1. I wish it was written in 1st person-- it got annoying hearing Thomas' name every line. Plus, I usually connect better when the protagonist is the narrator.  2. I did not like any of the characters that much. Especially Thomas, the main character, who I thought was very annoying. All of the Gladers had an irritating personality to me and Teresa's character, like a previous reviewer said, was too flat. I guess Newt was my favorite character but at times I couldn't stand him.  3. The language of the Gladers was annoying. Especially 'Good that!'. Really? lol  Overall it was a great read and I am looking forward to starting the 2nd book.

B005J9ZFQG|5.0|When it comes to classic 80's horror you can't go wrong with Evil Dead 2. Evil Dead 2 is a remake of the first movie, but done in a good way. The movie got gore, action, and humor through the movie nonstop, Bruce does a excellent as ash, and the fx in the movie are to die for. Had the Anchor Bay version which is pretty the same as the Lion Gate, but I had to go with the Lion Gate do to the classic cover which was the original movie poster. Evil Dead 2 is a must own!!!!!!

B001POX73C|5.0|It's been a few years since I read this book, and I was struck all over again by how amazingly talented Georgette Heyer was. Her Regency romances are so far above what any author produces today that it's unfair to compare them. Most historical novels published now are really contemporary stories with just a little muslin window dressing. When you read a Georgette Heyer Regency, however, you are transported to the era in a way that no other author has, or ever will, match. My favorite thing about this particular novel--one of Heyer's best, in my opinion--is that the hero, Freddy, is so different from the typical Heyer hero. Freddy is not the ruthless, cynical, sardonic Corinthian that Heyer often wrote about. Instead, he's a rather silly, carefree, fashion-obsessed bachelor with no interest in women, who gets roped into the heroine's plot to catch another man. Along the way, we see Freddy grow into a reliable, strong man whose sense of responsibility for Kitty turns into love. Likewise, we see the heroine, Kitty, turn away from her schoolgirl ideas of love and romance, to a better understanding of what makes a man a hero. \\"Cotillion\\" is the perfect place to start for anyone wondering what all the fuss over Georgette Heyer's novels is about.
B0056C6XIA|4.0|For my need this tool does the job.  The rubberized grip is easy to hold on to.  One of the main tool the pliers is spring loaded so it stays open. A nice feature to have since my more expensive SOG multitool does not have it.  The pliers in SOG does not have spring so I have to manually open it each time I want to use the pliers.  It may not seem to be that big of a deal not to have spring loaded but if you use your pliers often enough you definitely will appreciate not having to use your fingers to manipulate pliers to open, close, open over and over.  After playing around other built-in tools, I would consider this tool as at best emergency outdoor tools and definitely not consider it as ultimate survival pack.  The primary advantage of this tool lies in its portability and that it carries the most essential items which is the ability to start fire and serrated knife to cut small branches for fuel.  The included small flashlight does give adequate amount of light so it is a nice extra to have around.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It was an ok game but its kinds stupid The graphics are really bad but its free... so what do u expect
B003B02PEU|3.0|I find the story slow moving at times. I guess in Mississippi life was a whole lot slower. But it was fast enough to keep me interested. This was more of a human interest story between Willie Traynor &Callie Ruffin.
B002RKSCA6|4.0|It's always interesting to see how a classic like this differs from its many Hollywood adaptations. In this case, the book is very little like the lurid depictions of Mr. Hyde and his doings. In the book, Hyde's depravities are mostly offstage, and the reader learns about them through Jekyll's elegant euphemisms. In fact, the last half of the book is entirely Jekyll's narration of events through the means of a letter he leaves for his friend Utterson. It's a device that probably wouldn't fly today, but was possibly necessary in RLS's day, to avoid detailing just what Hyde had been up to. Some of the language in this book is a bit turgid and I occasionally had to re-read passages to get the gist of them, but I still enjoyed reading it. It's an interesting look at the duality of human nature and what happens to those who give in to the dark side.
0062060554|5.0|I really like medical mysteries, so I picked up \\"Before I Go To Sleep\\" based on the book cover description, not knowing what a treat I was in for.  I had no idea this book would have so many twists and turns, and a total blow-out surprise ending. Please don't thumb through the book or you will spoil the thrill waiting for you! It is one of the best-conceived mysteries I have read, on the order of the \\"Sixth Sense\\", or the best of Hitchcock.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a pretty good game I enjoy playing the almost endless supply of games that this app has to offer
030726999X|4.0|What a great read this was. The plot is so intracite but still surprisingly easy to follow. The characters are very dynamic and by the end of the book you really feel as though you know them. There are a lot of characters to keep track of but the author always reminds you who they are. If that is not enough, there is always the Vagner family tree to refer to. All in all a great, well paced thriller. Book does howerver center more on a male journalist than \\"the girl with the dragon tattoo\\". The second book is much more \\"Lizbeth centric\\" . Last quarter of book is a little weird as there are two seperate endings. The Swedish locations are almost impossible to keep track of, though really not essential to the plot.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Well...The game is tricky in that it made me think I was smart; then, as each level became increasingly more challenging, I became less smart forcing me into an \\"I'll show you\\" mind-set. It's so much fun.

B000KZBRG6|3.0|Maybe I got a bad one, but I checked this meter against a Sekonic L-328, Canon 7D and Panasonic GF1 and most of the time the reading differed by a stop or more.  The Sekonic L-328, 7D and GF1 all were metering within 1/2 stop of each other.  The L-208 only agreed with the other meters about 20% of the time.  The other 80% of the readings were a stop or more off.  Sometimes it read higher, other times it read lower.  If this meter consistently read high or low, I could adjust for it.  But it was so erratic I returned it.  UPDATE::  I decided to purchase another L-208 because I really liked the size and the price.  The second meter was MUCH more accurate and consistant.  It was always within 1/2 stop of the Sekonic L-328.  The nice thing about this meter is that it is so small you can fit it in any pocket.  When I am shooting with a 120 TLR, I like to travel light.  I can hang the L-208 off of the camera strap or stick it in my pocket.  No need to bring a camera bag!  If the first meter I purchased wasn't defective, I would have given the L-208 4 stars or maybe even 5 stars.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I would recommend this app to anyone who loves games.  Some of the games are harder than others, but you have to unlock them.  The only problem I have run into is adds.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|This game is an ok game. I got this game and it isn't like AWESOME, but you can get entertained with it for like 30 minutes. I play it sometimes, but usually after a couple minutes I get bored and play a new game. If you have like no other choices than you should buy this game for your android.
B0052RDHTM|1.0|I am a great fan of Ken Follett.  I have read virtually everything he has written.  However, I refuse to pay this price to read this book on my Kindle.  I will simply buy the book at the used bookstore before I will be raped by the publisher by paying a price the same as a hardback.  And I doubt that I am the only one who feels this way.  I will continue to used my Kindle but I will think twice before I purchase a book from this publisher.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Normally games like this are great for a short time until the challenge starts outweighing. the fun.  However,  not with this game.  Thisgame is wonderfully stimulating, challenging,  and peacefully zen all at the same time!  VERY much worth the purchase and more!
B000QEIORG|5.0|The songs are either razor sharp (read: about as heavy as a song can be without being metal) or beautifully dreamy. Dave definitely benefits from having a band to back up his chops here.
B006O5Y0SS|1.0|So Booooooooooring... I just woke up! I dont understand how the Tomatometer failed me. In the past its always been on the money. Not this time. I think somewhat got paid to put numbers higher. I slept through some of this crap because it was... uh mmmh did I mention... so booooring. Acting seemed fake. I usually love anything Rachel is in, not this. Maybe its Woody, I dont think I have ever liked any of his movies.

B000020617|5.0|And that's fine. The songs sound like they were constructed from a definite framework, and save for the hazy ballad \\"Ain't It The Life,\\" everything here is palatable.
0062082353|5.0|I am a pretty slow reader, but when I picked up this book, I finished it in three days!  I just couldn't put it down.  This is such an amazing story about a true American hero. Chris Kyle may not like the title of \\"The Legend\\", but it certainly is fitting. This is an exhilarating first-person account of a true American hero. The world definitely needs more Chris KYLES! Thank you Chris for everything you've done!
B00006WKSZ|5.0|This one came out the year before \\"lovedrive' , that was a disc that really made them popular in a larger way. But they were great before that newer style came about, they were melodic metal with influences back to Hendrix among others.  The song list is a best of from their 1972-78 output. Songs like the classic 'in trance' , 'he's a woman , she's a man' , 'robot man' , \\"speedys coming' and other standout tracks are on here live and sounding clear and well sung and played.  I do wonder why the band dropped 'I'm going mad\\" from their playlist by that time.<br />As it would have been great to hear live. This is a solid wonderful metallic beast of a live cd. THe missing track is on 'taken by force' remaster , if you have bought the version without that song. Mine is from the 80's and has it.<br />Rock on scorpions.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like it is a really fun game and I like the game dirty gold and the game speed chaos

B001P3OMY6|5.0|This novel is light and funny. No, it's not cerebral. But it great chick lit. I got a huge kick out of it.
B006ZBRMOU|5.0|This was a satisfactory ending to an incredible trilogy. As the third book, there were still lots of ups and downs, and plenty of nail-biting moments. Christian and Ana are continuing to learn how to deal with one another. I love Fifty and I enjoyed the bonuses with Fifty's POV. They show how far he has really come since he first meets Ana. This series is a must-read for any romance fan who loves an emotional roller coaster and a book that is impossible to put down.
B001LF347E|5.0|Love the show.  Love the obvious chemistry between Arthur and Merlin and the actors who play them.  The extrovert and the introvert, both needing each other.  Also a great medium to talk to my sons about what it's like to grow up to be a man.  Introduces ideas about honor and friendship and kindness.  Both characters grow throughout the series.  Can't wait for Season 5.  Finally, I would watch Colin Morgan in anything.  He (thought the other young actors are good) stand out as one to watch for the future.

1589795474|4.0|This is not a self-help book and should not be read as one.<br /><br />This book is a compilation of research done by the two authors in the profiles of 'millionaires' defined as having a  net-worth exceeding one million dollars (USD). Since this book was first published there have been 2 major economic crises which probably have \\"knocked\\" a few out of this group.  Those who had large portions of their net-worth in real-estate or investment portfolios are probably not in this group any more due to bursting of the \\"bubble\\"  However, the main point of this book is to indicate that most \\"millionaires\\" are not the typical \\"Hollywood\\" defined character, but the \\"middle class\\" guy or gal living next door to you. Yes, their \\"outliers\\" like Bill Gates & Madonna, but the authors were looking at the top 10% and not the 1%<br /><br />My son gave this book to me to read and said - this is you & mom.  I read and laughed my way through the whole book. Yes, this is us. If you were to meet us - you would just say another \\"middle class\\" couple. Our neighbors do not even know. And we will never tell them. I participated in their on-going survey after I read this book. That is why I said at the first do not buy this book as self-help. It is a study and brings out the critical points on why we are what we are and why others are not - even though they have similar income levels or opportunities. The pieces of wisdom presented throughout the book are \\"common sense\\" - nothing more.<br /><br />Do not spend more than you earn<br /><br />Avoid debt as much as possible (Be debt free)<br /><br />Do not try \\"Keeping up with the Joneses\\" or flaunt your wealth.<br /><br />Maintain a \\"middle class\\" (whatever that is) life style.<br /><br />And yes as the book describes, my wife is more frugal than me and our son even more so than both of us. And no, we do not live on beans and toast. We cook at home and have steak and red wine.<br /><br />If you decide to buy and read this book, remember it is not really self-help one. It just explains a \\"hidden\\" group of net wealth millionaires and how they got there.res and how they got there.

B0038W0OHQ|1.0|Sadly, the Steel Series 7H is a disappointing headset that every consumer should avoid. Within two months of owning 7H I started to experience an accumulative amount of problems. First, my microphone began cutting out randomly. It would waiver from functioning to nonexistent every few minutes. The one good thing is that Steel Series has excellent technical support. They sent me a replacement cord with no question, although that didn't solve the problem.  For a pricey headset the 7H is not durable. I took decent care of it, yet due to design it began to physically break down. The headset is extremely tight which puts abnormal pressure the connection points (where the headset is able to come apart). One clip which held the left headphone broke from just being on my head. Not long after the headphone  broke off from the head band.  From only using the headset as it was designed for two months, I had to keep a broken clip taped, had a headphone floating on my ear and a microphone that cut out intermittently.  I eventually replace it with the Steel Series Siberian V2 a vastly superior product. It is much more comfortable and durable. Also, the sound is incredible  all for the same price as the 7H.  I feel bad giving this product a negative review based on the great customer support. However, it is an extremely poor product that everyone should avoid. I have nothing but positive things to say about Steel Series . The 7H is an abbreviation amongst an otherwise good line of gaming related devices.
0439023521|5.0|I'll make this brief:  You want a good futuristic book that has a mix of Shirley Jackson, Death Race, and Lord of the Flies, here it is.  The story is fast paced which makes for a good page turner.  I adore Katniss Evergreen's character for her independence and strong will.  She has an incredibly crappy life, but she doesn't say \\"Whoa is me\\" all the time.  She uses her wit and skill to pull herself out of her situation regardless of the odds against her.  It's refreshing to read a book where the main character is a teenage girl who isn't brooding about how horrid her life is, nothing seems to matter, and how a guy is her true salvation like MOST of the stroppy, emo, love triangle book series have been as of late.  I personally see her as a great fictional role model for today's teenage girls, giving them the message of \\"You can do it no matter what life throws at you\\".

B005XQLBU4|3.0|I enjoyed this game and was frustrated by it.  (Who likes to lose?)  But losing seems inevitable with more and more missiles going  faster and faster.  Maybe I didn't play it enough to get better at  it.  Getting to high 20's wasn't too hard but level 36 was a stress  inducing exercise in futility.  :-)  But I uninstalled today when it started displaying an ad 5 days after  installation.  Might consider reinstalling to see if ad goes away again  for 5 days if I get the urge.  I agree with another who said it would be nice if you didn't have to wait for  the score to be added up.  Seems to take forever.  And perhaps one begins  to remember where the upgrade levels are, but it would be useful if there  was a shorthand clue on the building repair page so a person can make  appropriate decisions about repairing buildings or upgrading costs before  advancing past the building repair screen and then finding they should/could  have done more (or less) repair when looking at the upgrade screen.  Anyway, would have given 4 or 5 stars until the ad started annoying me.  UPDATE:  Reinstalled.  Ad came back again after 5 days.  Deinstalled.  Was  going to recommend to two friends but not now.
B0028RXXE8|4.0|I really enjoyed this series. Not only was the plot and acting great but the additional material - the comentaries and the pop-up information bits about Rome and the culture of the time - was great also. The only complaint I have is that when I viewed the pop-up material I could not have the captions on as well. If you are hard of hearing you have to choose between the dialog and the extra information.
1439163154|2.0|This book should be read by every aspiring writer as an example of how quickly fiction can turn to self-indulgent, masturbatory, soulless drivel when written without any deep sense of conviction and spirit and only for fame and self-gratification.

B0053F042G|1.0|Source Code, 2011 film  The story begins with a view of the Chicago waterfront. One man rides a train; he seems stunned and unaware of himself. A double-decker train carries commuters to Chicago. There is an explosion outside! Next there is a strange event where he is questioned. \\"Who bombed the train?\\" We return to the train. More strange behavior. He searches a restroom and finds a strange machine. He warns the crew. There is an explosion. Is it real? Is it confusing? \\"This makes no sense.\\" Who is the bomber? Quiet and withdrawn? \\"Anything strange on the train?\\" [The actors in this story?] He gets off the train to follow a man. Motion sickness? There is a fight, a man falls on the tracks. Then we see more strange events. Who is controlling things? We finally learn of the reason for this exercise: a terrorist will explode a \\"dirty bomb\\" in Chicago!  His next assignment is to find the conducter's room. He fails in this. \\"Everything is going to be OK.\\" The scenes repeat. The man acts strange. He borrows a phone from a lady. There is another change of scenery. \\"Am I dead?\\" Is he imagining all this? His controllers speak to him. Can he find the bomber? \\"Send me back in.\\" He finds the bomb with its cell phone activator. Did he find the bomber? \\"Sorry.\\" He follows another man. Will he lose him? \\"I know its you.\\" There is a surprise in the trunk. The man explains his actions. \\"There has to be rubble.\\" He now has the bomber's name. He has a last request. The SWAT team gets the driver. A job well done. The story runs on. Will his mission be terminated? \\"Thank you for your service. Good luck!\\" So now the story repeats again. Shawn disarms the bomb.  Will they clear his memory? He stops Derek Frost. \\"It's over.\\" He makes a phone call. Then another to a dead soldier's father. \\"Are you OK?\\" There is conversation among the passengers. They are not friendly. Shawn makes a bet with a man; can he make the other passengers laugh? The red button is pushed. We see the body! \\"It is a beautiful morning in Chicago.\\" \\"Do you believe in fate?\\" \\"So what do you want to do today?\\" Goodwin gets a text message on her phone. \\"Tell him everything will be OK.\\"  This is a very strange story that repeats itself over and over (to create padding and make it appear that something is happening). Not recommended. It shows why the story or plot is the most important part of any movie. The end shows a long list of names for the people who worked on this production. So who paid for this production? There were other movies about people being threatened by terrorists with a bomb. They were all better.

0446573019|2.0|Lee Child's Jack Reacher kept coming to mind until I heard character's name mentioned.  Also, the ending was weak, like there's another book to explain how Puller uncovered the perpetrator, his motives and methods.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|The game does take a little patience and perseverance, but the games are really fun and entertaining. I recommend it.
1451627289|4.0|A compelling story which propels the reader, along with the main character Jake Epping, back in time through a portal in Al Templeton's pantry to the year 1959. Al has known for a long time about the 'rabbit hole' to the past and desperately wants Jake to do what he couldn't do, and change the course of history by preventing J.F. Kennedy's assassination.<br /><br />King has clearly researched the years before Kennedy's assassination in depth. He does a great job at describing the characters, political tensions, social changes and life in general, so much so that despite it's subject matter (time travel) it's all extremely believable. Aided by the added nostalgia for those who have previously read 'IT' this gives the illusion that the reader is recalling their own past memories from that era.<br /><br />The past is stubborn ~ sorry...obdurate ;-) but Jake is pretty determined and the suspense is kept up throughout. A good read with many aspects that I liked, including the changes Jake himself wants to make. Possibly not as important to the story as the looming assassination, but tangible because they were about ordinary people and were events which I could understand Jake wanting to influence.<br />This is a book which is about far more then just one moment in history...it's about how we as humans always think life would be different (and usually better) if certain events in our lives had or hadn't happened. But when one small change could feasibly trigger a number of further changes...would we risk it?...given the chance?
B00544L9EI|3.0|i odered this record, downloaded it, and #3 would not download. it kept saying \\"download failed\\"  so, i'd retry and i keep getting the same message. think they took the whole price for the record too....i hadn't even listened to it yet either...

076790592X|4.0|More of a 3.5, really.  I'll start by saying that my one real issue with this book was that there wasn't much terribly original thinking within it. I definitely wanted more of a 'Wow, I never thought about it that way' feeling from Morrie's philosophies, and while it's hard to argue with anything he says it didn't feel like anything I hadn't heard from somewhere else before. Something probably by Disney.  In general, the book is well done. I liked the characters and found the story and the language very readable. At times I felt like a fly on the wall listening in on a Tuesday conversation and I liked that. Most importantly I didn't get bored.  From what I learned in reading this, I get the sense that it's the kind of thing Morrie would have wanted left behind in his stead and that's the best thing about this book. It felt like a more than adequate tribute, and I felt like I had gotten to know Morrie enough to be able to make that judgment. It's not overly emotional or sappy or pulling relentlessly on the reader's heartstrings, and it doesn't have to. It is a short and sweet reminder of the important things, a gentle prod in the direction of what matters, and it doesn't pretend to be anything else.
B005E3ZGIE|5.0|The title of this review is pretty much a summary of the review itself. I first came across Behemoth through interacting with someone in a chatroom on an online discussion forum. I was saying how I was big into heavy-sounding groups like Slipknot, Shadows Fall, and Children of Bodom, and then this guy said to me, &#34;You want something REALLY heavy? Check these groups out!&#34; So then he sent me a number of YouTube links to various groups, of which Behemoth was one. So I investigated, and when I heard these guys for the first time, I was blown away; I had never heard anything THIS heavy before.<br /><br />So, more about this album itself. It is, to say the least, on the very high end of the artistic spectrum of death metal, or blackened death metal, to be exact in this case. The songs are somewhat more distinguishable from one another, which is something that is quite hard to find, as far as death metal albums go. Nergal's vocals provide a thick sense of brutality to go along with the rock-solid guitar riffs and solos, and Inferno just blows me right off my feet every time with his lightning fast double-bassing and blast-beats.<br /><br />Simply put, these guys are absolutely amazing with their incredible precision, high-energy, stamina and endurance, which, as I see it, defines them as the perfect death metal band.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game for all ages! lots of mini games all in one thing. and the games are not as bad as most mini games.
B005CVWWJY|5.0|The description and reviews had me intrigued enough to read this book. I rarely read fantasy novels - a fact I should reconsider.  This was the best book I have read in a long time, and unexpectedly so. I could not stop reading it! While reading I could visualise the scenery and kept thinking: \\"this would make an awesome movie!\\".  The way it was written made it very easy to read. It could have been made quite convoluted or overly-clever, but it wasn't and I think it made the story flow well. The concept itself was clever enough and I became absorbed in this world as much as the characters were.  I'm glad I read this book and intend to read it again in the future - I loved it that much!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|the perfect app for reading the Bible!  many different versions to download and even a variety of reading plans (with reminders in case you forget)
0525478817|5.0|...  Please, just read this book.  It will contribute in a positive way to your experience as a human being. And no, it's not just for people who already read John Green, or who are Nerdfighters, or who are literary. Anyone can pick up this book and be lost in it nearly immediately.  Not sure if you will like it?  If you can answer yes to any of:  Are you smart? You will like it.  Are you a teenager? You will like it.  Are you an adult? You will like it.  Do you know what a metaphor is? You will like it.  Do you feel? You will like it.  Do you sometimes wish that you did not feel? You will like it.  Do you wonder, in your heart sometimes, whether you are a good person? You will like it.  Did you study English or Religion in school/university? You will like it.  Do you think that the formal study of English or Religion has been made unnecessarily stupefyingly boring? You will like it.  Do you slurp up pop culture as though it were delicious soup? You will like it.  Does the exercise of relating to others confuse and sometimes terrify you? You will like it.  Do you breathe? You will like it. Even if it will make you stop breathing periodically.  John Green has asked that his fans post no spoilers, and so I won't. Everyone deserves to come to this book on their own terms. It makes it really hard to write a review, however, that doesn't consist of \\"Hey, take my word on it as a totally random person off the internet whom you do not know and is totally uncredentialled - you must read this.\\"  So, instead, I'll say:  Every once in awhile a book comes along that makes you wish either that it had more pages or that you were a slower reader, because you have fallen in love with it as you go along, before you even reach the end, and are worried about never being able to come new to something so good again. That's this. So, please, just read this book.

058201736X|5.0|I adore Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl and have read it multiple times over the years. Anne's diary has come to mean different things to me as I've grown older - when I first read it as a ten-year-old girl, I was fascinated by the hidden life she led with her family and there was a sense of dread and excitement about her precarious circumstances, the danger of being discovered. When I read Anne's diary again as a teenager, I came to empathize with Anne's frustrations with her mother and the other adults around her whom Anne felt did not understand her and treated her as a child. I felt Anne's desire to be 'heard' and not just treated as an inconvenience or child was so much aligned with what I was going through during adolescence.<br /><br />When I re-read the diary as an adult, I came to appreciate all the other things - the tragedy of having lost such an amazing and talented young voice in the most horrible of circumstances; the beauty of Anne's writing which is all the more amazing given how young she was when she wrote this diary; and the themes of alienation, fear, and hope. Now, as the mother of a young daughter, I read this diary again and gain another fresh perspective - of the complex relationship between daughter and mother. Anne had a strained relationship with her mother Edith, and clearly gravitated toward her beloved Pim (father). This was obvious even before Anne and her family were compelled to move into hiding in the Annex. As a mother, reading Anne's thoughts about her mother (often unflattering) was a disconcerting experience, though things do improve somewhat later on.<br /><br />Anne Frank's Diary of a Young Girl is a classic not only of Holocaust literature, but also a classic Young Adult read with its myriad themes that will appeal to both adolescents and adult readers.
B005LRWRZ8|3.0|Megadeth has been hailed by some as the most consistent band out of the big 4 of the American thrash/speed metal scene.  They have been producing decent albums since their reformation after they disbanded because of Dave Mustaine's medical issues.  A couple of band member changes over the years may have changed the chemistry of the band yet the quality of the albums they produced have always been up to par with the best of the genre has to offer.  While they had albums that had me gagging such as Risk, The World Needs a Hero and Cryptic Writings - without those albums - the current incarnation of Megadeth wouldn't have learned what worked and didn't work for them as a band.  They did learn regardless of what people say, Metal as a genre is unforgiving a genre in all of music.  Certain parameters must still be adhered and no matter how many classifications they create to distinguish bands of today - it all amounts to satisfying the core subculture you are catering to. In other words, it's all noise and grunts no matter how you cover it.  The band hit that subtle balance with The System Has Failed, United Abominations and Endgame which were a perfect dose of old school Megadeth with modern sensibilities.  They have stuck to the formula of having one to three fast songs along with midtempo \\"radio friendly\\" numbers over the years.  Thirt3en does deliver that in spades with uptempo tracks like \\"Neverdead\\" (written for a Konami game coming up this year), \\"Fast lane\\" and \\"Wrecker\\".  \\"Deadly Nightshade\\" and \\"13\\" harkens back to their Youthanasia catalog and songs like \\"Whose life (it is anyways?)\\" sounds perfectly in tune if they had released it with Cryptic Writings with its punk/hardcore vibe reminiscent of \\"FFF\\".  What made the album a little iffy though is the revivals/remake/rehash of old b-sides that has been available for years already regardless if it's on demo form or fan exclusive downloads.  \\"Black Swan\\" which was reworked to have a faster feel to it still has that hook that can be stuck in your head but also lost its luster because of how it was arranged this time.  \\"New World Order\\" and \\"Millenium of the Blind\\" were demos that would have been included in Youthanasia that were re-recorded with mixed results - both of them still good songs but NWO lost a lot of its grit to a fault.  \\"Millenium of the Blind\\" out of the reworked songs stand out as the plodding riffs and maniacal vocal delivery gives it a bruising feel that the band hasn't had since Peace Sells...but who's buying.  If you have no issue with paying an album that should have been an EP, I do suggest you buy/download this album.  For the collectors and avid fans though, this is literally just adding to their legacy of producing great albums with minor issues and all.  The lack of speed and technicality in most songs in their past few albums which had made them the most talented band out of the big 4 would probably hinder the end factor of enjoying their recent releases,  they have stuck to a formula which has given them a second life as a critically acclaimed band once again yet they have lose their way in regards to the danger and aggressive outlook they have presented long before the advent of the digital mp3 age.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great way to pass the time.  little kids may eben play some of the minigames.  its great.  I use this a lot on vacation Andrew such.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|**UPDATE 3/20/2012 Game is back to being COMPLETELY USELESS. It won't even open more than half of the time (crashes at the hourglass or POP Games logos). The other half of the time I can't make it through the plant selection menu to even get to the level. Since the update, it has been ruined. It was bad enough before. Is it too much to ask to have an app that actually functions? Had to go back to 1 star because it is literally unplayable.<br /><br />**UPDATE: a newer version of the game is more stable. I can generally get through some levels before it crashes on me, but not always. Still very frustrating. I did raise the rating from the original 1 star, though.<br /><br />ORIGINAL RATING: I like the game, as I've played it before. But it crashes every couple minutes and freezes my phone (Google Nexus). Not worth $2.99 for a game that barely works, and only in spurts. It IS compatible with my device, but it is just a really really poor adaptation. I can't even make it through a level without it crashing, and then I have to kill the app and start over.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|You would think that after writting 5 900-1000 page books, Martin could of found an end to the stories! Instead, he intoduced new characters in the 5th book and never brought any of the story-lines to a satifactory conclusion!

B005BDZLYQ|3.0|8 albums on 4 cd's. No original art work or liner notes. Normally I only buy RVG or Mcmaster editions. But some of these albums, they only seem to be in expensive Japanese import, which I don't have money for :)  So about the sound quality: I compare some songs of soul station and roll call from this collection against, the latest blue note ones. First of all I'm no audiophile, I don't have $5000 system with $500 cables :). I do have a music program Ableton which I can analyze audio spectrum etc. they are almost the same. The ending is of each song is 2-3 seconds shorter. So this collection is not garbage sound wise. If there is a small distortion in blue note edition, it is there in the real gone jazz one. Same thing with small/minor dropouts.  Somebody says about these real gone jazz collections that the are dubbed from lp's? I don't know. Naxos has some great historical recordings dubbed from old lp's that won awards, so I doesn't have to be a problem, right?  I'm happy that I, age 39, can still listen to this wonderful music and musicians, and that somebody still care to release them so I can buy them. I like to listen to jazz, for max $10 a cd, not $35-50 import. For this kind of money these are nice collections. See it as starters, and the albums that you really love, like Soul Station and Roll Call, you can buy from blue note, and get the liner notes and orginal art work :)
B004LWZW7O|3.0|I was very excited to see this movie once I heard about the concept. All in all it was okay, but it could have really been amazing. Parts were slow, there was too many cheesy \\"in time\\" catch phrases to try to be witty but just came off lame.   I would say it might be worth checking out for the concept alone but nothing to buy, you wont be watching this again...
B002SSUQFG|4.0|Great watch.  Looks great.  Haven't owned Seiko's before and bought this on an impulse.  I wanted a no-frills watch and that is what I got.  Unfortunately I must have misread the size dimensions because this watch is very small on me.  I have big wrists (maybe 7.5 inches) and it looks as if it were meant for a child.  Other than that, its great.
