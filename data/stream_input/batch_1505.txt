B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Although I finished reading Strayed's Wild last week, I have been putting off writing about this read because I dread having to return this book to the library.  Wild is definitely a keeper on so many levels.  Strayed writes with such brutal honesty which allows herself (the protagonist in this memoir) to become an actual flawed human being which, in turn, allows the reader to find herself or himself within the text such as I did.  Struggling with the death of her mother and the end of her marriage, Strayed sets out on a journey across the Pacific Crest Trail in an attempt to find herself, forgive herself, and forget the \\"what ifs\\" in life.<br />A first for me reading this memoir was finding myself laughing aloud again and again while reading about Strayed's encounters with her U-Dig-It stainless-steel trowel.  Among other uses, this tool was utilized to create a make-shift toilet in the ground.  Having no prior experience with this device combined with Strayed's blunt description of the undeniable urgings of nature, the visual formed was laugh-out-loud humorous while invoking a sympathetic admiration for the main character.  Fighting fatigue after a recent surgery, I continued to turn Wild's pages well into the night so that I could rejoice in Strayed's triumphs along the trail right along with her.<br />Undoubtedly, a challenge to one's body would be a fitting way to meet in order to discuss Cheryl Strayed's Wild.  Perhaps, a team created to benefit breast cancer victims walking a marathon and one-half together as in the Avon Breast Cancer Walk in Chicago would allow plenty of time to discuss Wild and evaluate one's life . . .  believe me.

B0031RAOVY|5.0|I purchased this movie for my daughter who had watched it awhile back.  She and I both like dogs.  I was anticipating buying it for her from one of the box-retail stores, but found it considerably cheaper on Amazon.  I purchased from a dealer (Movie Mars) that I have purchased from before.  Their service and time of delivery was outstanding as before.  I will continue to purchase through this dealer and Amazon.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|This album is only a few days old, i dont think thats enough time to understand the 'whole thing, so people giving it a five like me arent being very honest at the moment, i think we all know its potential and complexity that it will lead to a 5.  But i will be honest and give it a 3.5 right now, but i will give it a 5 because i dont feel like coming back and changing this review to a 5 in a few months.  I did that with Vapor Trails.
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|***This review may contain spoilers***<br /><br />No matter how much he and his fellow scenarists deny it, Ridley Scott's 'Prometheus' is very much a souped-up update of Scott's 'classic' 1979 sci-fi horror show, 'Alien'. The film begins with a cryptic scene set during pre-historic times when a space traveler (who looks like a muscle-bound 'Mr. Clean' with pasty skin) drinks a dark liquid concoction that causes him to disintegrate. We find out later, that quite incredibly, the traveler's disintegration causes a biogenetic chain reaction, which is responsible for the origin of life on earth.<br /><br />Cut to 2089. Archaeologist couple, Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway, make a new discovery of an ancient cave drawing that's similar to other cave drawings already discovered, pointing to a distant moon where Mr. Clean might have come from (these humanoids are dubbed 'Engineers'). Cut to the Prometheus, a giant spaceship financed by multi-billionaire Peter Weyland, CEO of the Weyland Corporation. Weyland is played by Guy Pearce, made up to look like a senior on his last legs (despite a ton of prosthetics, the make-up department ends up managing to turn Weyland into a clone of Biff Tanner from 'Back to the Future, Part 2').<br /><br />Weyland gives the Prometheus crew a pep talk after they wake up from suspended animation, except he's a hologram. We're told by Vickers (Charlize Theron) that Weyland had a few weeks to live before the Prometheus took off but it turns out that he's been in stasis in private quarters, off limits to the rest of the crew. Weyland can't accept the idea that he's soon going to kick the bucket and hopes that the Engineers will restore his youth. Boy is he in for a big surprise!<br /><br />Before the ship arrives at its destination, David the Android house sits while crew members sleep in their pea pods. David, designed by Weyland, has a mind of his own and a nice British accent to boot. He keeps himself busy before the crew wakes up by studying thousands of obscure languages and watching old movies. For some reason, David doesn't seem to be programmed to obey orders and ends up digging around for clues by himself once the crew lands on the moon.<br /><br />Despite all the neat special effects, 'Prometheus' is saddled with one clich&eacute;d character after another. Holloway, the archaeologist leader, is the skeptical scientist who's contrasted with his lover Shaw, the 'believer', who is still bent on finding out the 'meaning of life' at film's end. Holloway is virtual cannon fodder after David infects him with the dark liquid seen earlier. Holloway proves to be thoroughly expendable when he becomes a virtual Zombie and Vickers must torch him to death with a flamethrower, to prevent him from getting back on the ship. Theron's Vickers, who turns out to be Weyland's daughter, has no interest in alien first contact and is a most unlikeable, one dimensional villain. Like Holloway, she's easily disposed of when she's crushed by the Engineer's disabled ship, during the denouement.<br /><br />The bulk of the action takes inside a giant cave which turns out to be the Engineer's spaceship. Crew members Milburn and Fifield, decide to run back to the Prometheus after they're spooked by all the bad vibes inside the cave. As there is no discipline amongst the crew members, they're allowed to abandon their colleagues and promptly end up getting lost. Of course they're the first ones to be dispatched by the alien monsters, squid like creatures completely reminiscent of Scott's '79 'frightfest'.<br /><br />Scott must have reasoned that audiences today still want a taste of that old 'Alien' magic, so Milburn and Fifields' demise must go the usual route of having the creature's tentacles reach inside the victims' bodies (through the mouth) and then having them subsequently disemboweled from the 'inside out'. But wait! Scott must up the 'ante' and he does so by having Shaw impregnated by an infected Holloway. Since she's now got an alien embryo in her belly, she's informed by David that she's now three months pregnant after one day! Not to worry! Set your self-service 2093 surgery machine on automatic pilot and let the device remove the nasty creature for you. Just make sure you give yourself enough shots of morphine, or whatever pain-killer does the trick!<br /><br />It turns out that David has discovered that one of the Engineers is still alive, inside one of those pea pods inside the cave. When they wake him up, the crew members who went back into cave (including Weyland), have to deal with the humanoid's 'anger management' problem, which they didn't count on. Everyone is killed and David gets his head ripped off (don't worry, he's somehow still able to think, talk and communicate!).<br /><br />It's not enough for the director to channel 'Alien' but why not a dose of 'Alien vs. Predator' while you're at it? That's essentially happens when the surviving bad-guy Engineer takes on the giant squid-like Alien, in a fight to the death struggle. Guess who wins?<br /><br />Leave it to Shaw (the aforementioned true believer), to want to go off to distant places, in an attempt to extract an explanation from the Engineers, who seemingly gave humans life but then changed their minds. As Shaw jets off with the help of David, one wonders why Shaw seems to ignore all the unpleasantness associated with her first encounter with the surviving Engineer. Is there any reason why she wouldn't get her head ripped off, during a second encounter with these baddies?<br /><br />If you're going to see 'Prometheus', it's for the special effects and not the characters. There's actually some neat visuals in this film, including a wondrous sandstorm and a star map highlighting Earth. But in the end, most of this stuff we've seen before. One thing I did learn from 'Promethesus' is that inside every giant squid-like alien, is one hell of an adorable gargoyle calling the shots!an alien embryo in her belly, she's informed by David that she's now three months pregnant after one day!

B00736ZKGS|5.0|This concert dvd rocks (no pun intended). for any one directioners out there, i highly recommend this product.  The dvd included extras, the full concert performance throughout the seasons (with of course a few surprises),music videos, and 5 of the most talented, good-looking,beautifully vocal, funny, and overall amazing british boys.  Anyyyywayyy, you should definetly add this to your wish list or even amazon cart if you're a 1D fan.  My friend (who also has this dvd) said that it's almost exactly like being at of their concerts except without annoying people next to you, the long drive there, and the expensive ticket price. :)

0375869026|5.0|For those of you looking for the tl;dr version of this review: Wonder is brilliant; I'm recommending it to every middle-grader parent I know, parent of a boy or girl regardless; you need to read this right now.<br /><br />I picked up a galley of R. J. Palacio's Wonder from NetGalley on a day it was promoted simply because I'm always looking for middle-grade books for my fourth-grader; he gets bored easily and he's drawn only to male protagonists. I'm also working with both my third- and fourth-graders on stopping the name-calling prevalent at their ages, and thought this might be a help.<br /><br />Boy, was I blown away.<br /><br />The book opens with Auggie, the main character, describing his facial deformities: \\"Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse.\\" At a break in the incessant reconstructive surgeries he's undergone, Auggie's mother finally thinks he's ready to start school, and his parents start him in a private middle school in New York City. He's assigned students to show him around the school and he seems to make a couple of friends. But as any parent of middle schoolers know, it's not easy in the best of situations, and if you are in any way visibly \\"different,\\" middle school is bound to be a nightmare.<br /><br />Beginning with Auggie and then going through various points-of-view of his sister Via, schoolmate Jack, sister's boyfriend Justin, and schoolmate Summer, Auggie goes through the school year. I'd challenge the Grinch himself to not be moved to tears at various points when reading Wonder.<br /><br />So many middle-grade books attempt to teach children life lessons, but drums them over the head with them. Wonder isn't too subtle for middle graders to pick up on, but it doesn't need to drum the lessons over and over again: It has a main character that allows the author to impart the lessons without a megaphone. Auggie's own inner (and sometimes spoken) dialogue provides many of the most poignant moments, like his assessment of Halloween: \\"I wish every day could be Halloween. We could all wear masks all the time. Then we could walk around and get to know each other before we got to see what we looked like under the masks.\\"<br /><br />The book's lessons -- of kindness, of accepting people who are different, of standing up for what's right instead of what's popular -- are something every parent wants their middle grader to learn. To have it written in such a beautiful and moving book is truly remarkable, and I hope my kids enjoy the book as much as I did. I'll update this review after they read it, but I really believe this one is going to be a universal win in this house.<br /><br />This review appeared previously on Goodreads.sh every day could be Halloween.

B0054JELS4|5.0|My wife discovered NCIS less than a year ago and ever since she watches the weekly shows. To get caught up on the first few years of NCIS, she borrowed the early seasons from the library. Some of the DVD's were scratched which made them difficult to watch. When I saw that Amazon was offering seasons 1-8 at such a low price, I bought the complete set. My wife started with disk 1 of season one and watches three or more shows at a time. She loves having her own unblemished set of NCIS episodes. Can't wait until season 9 is available!!

B0057R5XRG|3.0|If there is an appropriate analogy I can pull from this film, it would be that doing a good transfer of an old film to Blu Ray has parallels to how one would clone a prehistoric dinosaur from DNA sequencing;  both are based in some solid science but still need an artistic or creative touch.  Just like in Jurassic Park,  where filling in the holes in the DNA Sequencing with frog DNA lead to unexpected results, the way the experts went about turning this 19 year old film into Blu Ray was not ideal either.<br /><br />The TV and sound system I have is first rate and top notch.  Today's best movies and concert videos with 24bit 96khz sound are amazingly clear and sound so very good it often blows my friends and family away.  SO it is not my equipment at issue here.  Jurassic Park is a good film but this transfer is just OK.  I agree with some that at times the picture is a little grainy but that is not what bothered me so much.  The main dialogue sound coming from the actors from the center channel was really poorly done. I had to turn up the center channel to help out but it was still muffled and garbled.  Several times someone in my family would ask, \\"What did they say?\\"  to which the answer was often, \\"I did not catch that either.\\"  Sound effects and music from the other speakers was clear and well done, but not the best I've heard.  But the center channel was so badly transferred it made it really hard to enjoy the movie.  I find it interesting that more people have not commented about this and that makes me wonder if I got a bad copy.  The disks play fine thought.  Who knows?<br /><br />I'm just glad that I got this on sale for under $25 on Amazon.  For that price I won't complain too loudly.  The kids enjoyed watching the film and for them it was the first time they ever saw it.  But the crew that transferred this to Blu Ray could have done a much better job.

Since we have a nice big-screen TV and watch television and other movies in HD, it made sense to rent the HD version of this film. BIG mistake! Sure, it was only a dollar more than the SD version, but I'm fairly certain that the HD conversion actually made the quality WORSE. In the future, we'll rent pre-HD-era movies withOUT the HD enhancement. The movie itself was awesome and we watched it 3 times during our 24-hour rental!

B0041KKYEW|3.0|For an idea of what the special features on this disc COULD be, see the Criterion Edition Blu Ray of The Red Shoes. Granted, it is unfair to compare Black Swan's first disc release to a Criterion release of a film with the prestige of The Red Shoes. However, the way Darren Aronofsky tells it, there are hardly any ballet movies worth mentioning, so obviously his Black Swan ranks up there.<br /><br />The movie is whatever one makes of it. I personally enjoy it. It is no horror film, a thriller I guess. Natalie Portman's performance is quite intense and compelling. There is no question how hard she worked for the role, and that she did all the dancing.<br /><br />There is also no question that Natalie Portman is not a professional ballet dancer. This is discussed by both Aronofsky and Portman in the interviews that are the special features. Professional ballet is full devotion and the body cannot replicate that in a year. Not discussed, scenes of full body dancing often include Natalie's dance double, Sarah Lane, a star in her own right, currently Soloist at the well-regarded American Ballet Theatre.<br /><br />The amazing technology, artistry, talent and work that went into this film comes from all areas. Unfortunately, the special features are primarily Aronofsky and Portman talking in front of a camera. They glibly mention that some techniques were used, and the fact that they had to put on a stage production and that involves a whole second crew, and Natalie worked with some awesome people. Not even perfunctory. Obligatory. Can't talk about Natalie learning how to dance without at least mentioning a trainer and coach or two. All together, the disc pretty much only has the promotional materials that were out before the movie: A couple people talking briefly about their work, mostly a lot of Darren Aronofsky and Natalie Portman talking about Darren Aronofsky and Natalie Portman. Oscar Pandering.<br /><br />DVDs used to have materials like how stunts and special effects were done. Possibly some storyboards and some demonstrations of how the ideas came to life. This Blu Ray is such a sad wasting of available space. They could have shown Natalie fully doing the dancing, and shown a little about how they did the visual effects of combining film of Sarah Lane and Natalie.<br /><br />In fact, that material existed online at some point but was replaced.<br /><br />This disc is such a missed opportunity to give credit to all the amazing work put into the movie and teach viewers some of the fascinating techniques used. Instead, it's literally just a repackaging of materials on the movie's website. What is the point?

B002RI9S2Y|5.0|This book is a great read and both my 11 year old and 9 year old boys enjoyed reading it.
B007MAETA8|5.0|I have to admit to being cynical about this record when I first learned of it.  Not only because Mayer's previous effort, Battle Studies, was a study (sorry) in contrived lyrics and bland songwriting following on the heels of his brilliant Continuum, but also because the first song I heard from the album before the release was the country-inflected Shadow Days (which is not a bad song), and the last decade has seen a host of pop and rock legends making obligatory, calculated, and highly commercial country music cross-over nods.  So yes, I was nearly terrified that John had peaked on Continuum and was on a steady slide down to oblivion.<br /><br />But as I heard snippets of other songs from the album my reticence diminished, especially when I heard Queen of California with it's subtle hints of Billy Joel and not so subtle hints of Neil Young, so I picked it up and have loved it from the start.  John talked up the country aspect, and it's certainly there (and it's certainly good, in the spirit of country music before it became corporate and pop-ified in the 90s), but it's so much more.  It takes influence from rock, pop, blues, country, and folk.  I've mentioned Billy Joel and Neil Young, but there are hints of Fleetwood Mac, Bruce Hornsby, Dixie Dreggs, and so many more, but they're all meshed together seamlessly in John's sound.<br /><br />However, I think what raises this album above Continuum are the lyrics.  John tends to write about himself, often about heartbreak or love, and when he writes well it's charming, but when he doesn't it really comes off as overwrought like we saw on Battle Studies.  But here we get several stories from pure imagination like we haven't really seen from him before, none more notable than Walt Grace's Submarine Test, January 1967, which I think is the best song John has written to date.<br /><br />In a year only half gone and already jam packed with excellent releases from all kinds of artists, Born and Raised is the best album of 2012 so far, and I'm not aware of any impending releases that are likely to top it.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|As a Rush die hard, I own every album in their catalog; however, I will concede not all albums are excellence in action. In fact, there are some real stinkers that have come along in the last 35 years! Clockwork Angels, however, is not one of them! If you are a Rush fan, you'll probably like this. Though it has nothing to do with 2112 (except for the time on the album cover is 9:12 (or 21:12 by 24 hour standards), this album is of that quality. If you are not a rush fan, you might still like this album, or at least some of the songs. Thank you Rush for keeping it real.

No suspense, no thought, and no fun. This could have been a great movie if they spent more money on writers and less on computer graphics. Poor James Franco---literally poor---he must have needed a paycheck, was wasted in this cliched mess.

As an educator his message really speaks volumes to me because I am in an important role. I have the opportunity to teach young people today about Bob's message through education.

For the most part, like the 1990 live-action film, it is a strong movie, but it has its flaws.<br /><br />The central conflict of TMNT is very strong. The Ninja Turtles have been in disarray for a time, what with Leonardo in South America to train in becoming a better leader. Because without him, the unity of their group has sort of evaporated and his brothers have become aimless and restless. Of no one is this truer than Raphael. His frustration with Leonardo and their reconciliation with each other (and themselves) is the force that binds this film together. Very strong it is, especially in regards to Raphael and his double-life as a vigilante. I love this core of the film; the character conflicts are very sympathetic.<br /><br />The thing is, the film has another, external story about a millennia-old warlord who is trying to undo a curse he started a long time ago. Well-woven as the two storylines are into one, it still feels like two entirely different stories being told at the same time, and there's no question which is the better one. Leonardo and Raphael's conflict is far more connected to the audience than that of the warlord.<br /><br />The visuals are dark and atmospheric, which I generally never liked in this series, but it works well here. The character animation is brisk and suitably edgy, and the CG-camerawork is wonderful. The environments are spot-on; New York feels huge and bleak. The character designs are mostly very good (the Turtles, Splinter). On the other hand, most of the other ones feel very banal (April in particular looks way too young with her huge head and giant, Bratz-like eyes). The voice acting is, for the most part, heartfelt and genuine, but I don't think Splinter's voiceover works that well as a whole, sometimes his speeches sounding a lot like speeches. It is to thank the strength of the character's dialogue and character animation that his heart still comes through.<br /><br />The action and pace of the film is very well-handled and the film is told in a solid, consistent manner. The story's only holes arise from its lesser half, the warlord's story, in which a number of inconsistencies arise - have those monsters simply been taking a vacation until now? The music is rather inconsistent as well. The orchestrated score works well, but I miss the character in the music this series used to be famous for. A minor berth, true, the score does its job but no tunes are gonna linger on your mind.<br /><br />Overall, TMNT the movie is a worthwhile view, with a strong central plot and character arc that works against a rather banal side-story about the supernatural. That adds up to a rather disjointed film, though, one I cannot easily recommend. Although it is a child of its time, I recommend the 1990 live-action TMNT movie over this one.eover works that well as a whole, sometimes his speeches sounding a lot like speeches.

B005J29HD0|5.0|The Beach Boys \\"Smile Sessions\\" Vinyl LP was worth the wait of 30+ years, this package is great, the pressing is what I have come to expect from Capitol / EMI records and the sound is what makes me listen, a true masterpiece, a suprise long version of some of the best songs the group is noted for. Nice work, super sounds, perfect mastering, what more can you ask for?
0345803485|1.0|I read this book in its entirety because my sister insisted that despite the terrible writing, repetitive phrases,and horrible word choices that the book would indeed get better, it didn't. You have to hear everything 3 times as she debates things internally with all aspects of her personality (all of which are underdeveloped) and then sometimes says the same thing out loud. The bad writing repeatedly dragged me out of the story. I didn't find the sex scenes steamy because I didn't find the characters sexy. The whole book was very repetitive. I never developed any attachment to any characters. I finished the book not caring about what would happen next. It is driving me crazy that this is so popular. I have read horror stories with a sexier plot line.
0345803493|1.0|The book has a very male bias. The story is entertaining, and of course the sex scenes keep it interesting, but I'm annoyed at the stereotypes the author draws upon. Ana has been given so many of the negative traits women are accused of.  They are thinly veiled; I wonder why more readers haven't noticed?  It's ironic, really, that a book full of misogynistic stereotypes should popularized by women.  I noticed it in the first book, but thought perhaps Ana would redeem herself.  In the second book, however, it gets much worse. I doubt the third book will be much different, so out of principle, I'm not buying it. Anyway, here are examples:<br /><br />Women just want rich [jerks], and the nice guy always loses.<br />* TRUE: Jose is physically attractive, but a nice guy.  He obviously has a long-standing crush on Ana, but will never win her.  She flirts with him mildly (hooking her arm in his), but is furious when he tries to kiss her.  She takes it for granted that he will repair and maintain her old car for her.  She falls heads-over heals with the stern, domineering billionaire in less than a minute.<br />* THINLY VEILED: Unlike Christian's past girlfriends/subs, Ana gets angry when Christian tries to pay for things. 1) If Ana's immunity to Christian's wealth makes her special, it is implied that common women are gold diggers. 2) Christian has been made a rich jerk for the benefit of the readers.  The book is essentially saying, \\"Like Ana, you would deny your attraction to wealth, but in practice, you are totally lusting over this billionaire character.\\"<br /><br />Women are not as smart as men / Women sleep their way to the top<br />* TRUE: Ana is constantly flustered and asking for time to \\"wrap [her] head around this.\\"  When Dr. Flynn is talking to her, she \\"[blinks] at him, trying to absorb all these long words.\\" Ana, a straight-A college graduate is hired as a secretary and treated like an intern. She owns no objectives, takes no initiative, and performs menial tasks like fetching coffee and transcribing notes. She's not good at her job; she's always distracted on the phone or email. We learn eventually  that she was only hired because her boss was sexually attracted to her. After he is fired for trying to rape her, she is promoted based on his former exaggerations of her skill.  Watching Christian talk about his technological endeavors \\"in full flow is astonishing,\\" but Ana herself never expresses occupational ambition.<br />* THINLY VEILED: Ana is able to counter Christian verbally, but she argues like a child talking back to an authority and usually loses. Ana is good at pool (because Jose taught her, not because she taught herself), but Christian is better.  Ana is well read; Christian has not only read all the books she has, but owns a library.  Ana likes classical music, Christian introduces her to all of it and can play an instrument.  Ana is better than Christian at one thing: cooking.<br /><br />I guess those are the two most insulting.  The book also suggests that women just want to mother (crux of the story), women are weak and need protection (wouldn't it have been awesome if Ana had successfully talked Leila down?), skinny girls are more hot (Ana doesn't realize how attractive her waifish body is)...<br /><br />You might be thinking that I'm really making too much of this, but James could have made Ana legitimately good at her job.  He could have given her a skill.  He could have given her more rational arguments, some ambition, the ability to comprehend the \\"long words\\" of Dr. Flynn.  The whole point of a romance novel is that the reader is supposed to fantasize the she is the the protagonist. It's written in first person to help with that.  I don't like the weak, dull woman that Ana is, and I don't like how her mixture of childishness and maternal empathy are what makes her special.<br /><br />Now that I've pointed it out to you, do you see it?

B007V9YF5E|5.0|Gina Carano is real and in the flesh and packs a wallop.  No special effects for her.  She's tight and tough.  Love to see the way she handles herself in mixed martial arts; love to see the way she moves in and inhabits her body.  She's a regular person, not a movie star.  Her voice is flat and untrained, but that makes her even more interesting.  She's a natural actress.  Lots of big talented actors surrounding her.  The first time I watched it I thought of the returning women warriors from the Iraq war and how she could portray them in the right story.  Anyway, Soderberg should definitely do a sequel to Haywire.

B000FA5SMK|3.0|Intricately plotted and well written, but I don't think I have ever encountered a more unsympathetic lead character than John Corey. He is an annoying, odious lout.  In this book he is in Long Island recuperating from a shooting.  I doubt if that crime will ever by solved because the shooter could well be anyone who ever knew him for five minutes.  His personality makes the various love scenes implausible.  Would any woman want to be around him any more than necessary?  It requires quite a suspension of disbelief.  This guy got on my nerves to the extent that in every encounter with the villains, I was rooting for the bad guy to beat the hell out of him.

0385528752|5.0|This book lays out two key points about change nicely.    First is the struggle between the rational mind and the emotional will.  Hence the powerful image of the small rider a top the huge elephant only able to direct the elephant away from its desires for short periods of time.  I was able to quit smoking once I came to believe that I was non-smoker.  Why would I want a cigarette if I wasn't a smoker.  Which is how I found the feeling which let me change my behavior.    I'm a fan of David Allen's \\"Getting Things Done\\" so I was delighted to find his work cited in this book.  David's question, \\"What is the next action that I need to take now to accomplish my goal?\\", is the best example of shrinking the change that I can think of.  I wished I had read this book earlier.    The second key point is changing the path.  We all are born, grow up, grow old, and then die.  This is an immutable path that we all traverse.  In between there are many other paths that we follow.  This book is good at identifying how to make changes to some of those paths to fit our own ends.  As an example, we don't teach children to acquire language, how could we?  Children are born to acquire language.  Left to their own devices they learn how to speak.  We can encourage them from the sidelines and welcome them across the finish line but the original idea to acquire language comes from the path they are born on.  Changing the environment to follow a new path is as easy or hard as learning to speak was.    Changing the path is a powerful technique for facilitating change.  This book is filled with useful ideas on how to do this.  I like the \\"Action Trigger\\" concept.  Create an instant habit by setting up the environment to trigger the action that you want.  When I was a short order cook, I learned to grab the key ingredients and lay them where I could see them so I would have a visual cue to prompt me to what needed to be cooked next. The reference to \\"The Checklist Manifesto\\" by Atul Gawande confirms for me that the authors have done their research well.    I thought the U-shaped curve starting from Hope, dropping to inspiration, and rising up to confidence mapped closely to Theory U. Check it out at [...] Another great resource on what you need to do to accomplish systemic change.    There was a veiled criticism of Marcus Buckingham's \\"StandOut.\\"  I can see that if you use the strengths finder evaluation to keep you from making a change until you can recruit the perfectly balanced team then they are correct.  But if you use the strengths finder to find the bright spots that are already on your team then I think it would fit nicely with the methodology described in this book.    Reading the book was well worth the time invested in it.

B00729GQ0A|5.0|I was surprised by this book and how fast I was hooked by it. Honestly if I hadn't had that much stuff to do for university I probably would have finished it in 2 or 3 days.<br />This story is basically about a wiccan girl tapping into her powers who, due to specific circumstances of life, is forced to learn the truth about herself and the world that surrounds her. Well at least this first book is basically about that, of course I'm being slightly vague because I don't want to ruin anyone's reading experience. In this story you will find out about different types of elementals, their powers and you will be taken into a big adventure filled with dark secrets that are just waiting to be discovered. If you like reading about vampires or other paranormal creatures then this is the book for you.<br />I was a little bit worried that the book's romance story would be similar to Twilight, but it was very different due to the way Rebecca Hamilton portrayed the characters. I just couldn't get enough of Sophia and Charles, their initial dynamic was incredible and that just made the relationship so much more passionate! I mean Charles definitely is one of the most appealing and attractive male character I've read about in a while. I love the fact he is complex and has many layers to him. He's not just a pretty face or a great person, he can also be an annoying conceited prick and for some reason I find that far more appealing than a character who is annoyingly perfect or terribly flawed but like-able. Despite the fact that his identity holds more secrets than one he is probably one of the most \\"human\\" and \\"normal\\" characters I've read in a paranormal fantasy story.<br />I love the way Sophia is portrayed as well. She stands for what I think every female lead/main character should stand for. I hate when female characters are portrayed as weak, fragile little things that need the help of a man in other to face the world and its horrors. Sophia is nothing like that. Life has been rough on her and she has seen things that no should witness,her mother is really something and she has to live with the prejudice of a whole town due to her religion. If that doesn't make you strong then I don't know what else might. I guess what I mean to say is that Sophia is an amazing person because she can stand by her own and Charles isn't the air she needs to breathe, he is something she can't live without by choice.<br />Anyways, I don't want to give to much away. I really recommend this book to anyone who likes paranormal fantasy fiction. You will be surprised in many different parts and you will enjoy the experience of joining Sophia in discovering and learning about this secret world that's hidden right under our noses. I can't wait for the next book!rough on her and she has seen things that no should witness,her mother is really something and she has to live with the prejudice of a whole town due to her religion.

B004MC8CA2|4.0|LOVE this app. I use it for everything, it has a variety of content and functionality. For Bible studies I can look up one scripture and see the various translations with a few quick taps. For daily devotions I use one full year subscription and several shorter time lengths for deeper reflection or to go over certain books of the Bible or character traits to work on, etc. The other thing I like how it syncs with all my devices so if I read my devo on my iPhone it will show that I did it on my Kindle Fire.<br /><br />But the best thing about it is that it keeps you accountable. You can set it up to remind you to read daily, etc. You should check it out!

B001N26GFM|4.0|It is quite possible that more has been written and filmed about The Holocaust than any other historical event. Not just in regard to hard research, but many of the world's finest novelists have fictionalized the story, film makers have touched upon the subject, playwrights, composers, painters and poets. If there has been a way to express the shock- and shock is an understatement in this case- it has been attempted.<br /> John Boyne, a gifted and now internationally known Irish author, wrote the book \\"The Boy In The Striped Pajamas\\" in about two weeks time. As he said, in order to maintain \\"the voice,\\" once he began he was afraid to stop. The same is true when reading it- we are compelled to continue and it is evident from early in the book that Boyne has disguised the terminal words so that it can apply to any and all of the other holocausts' that occurred prior to and after this one. In fact, only once does Boyne choose to use a \\"telling\\" word; on page 54 one of the officers says, \\"Heil Hitler\\" but then we are told that the boy assumed that this was like saying, \\"Well, goodbye for now and have a pleasant afternoon.\\"<br />  Mark Herman, under the umbrella of both Miramax and BBC Films set forth to create this book effectively for film- a difficult task given that so much of the emotional swtruggle is internal and difficult to show on film, but he managed it and did so beautifully. Becauswe this film is in the smae catagoiry (in regard to quality) as \\"Sophie's Choice\\" I couldnt give it five stars- that doesn't mean that everyone shouldn't see this film. The small issues with the film are strongly outweighed by the genuis behind it- most of that genuis comes from the premise which leads us back to John Boyne.<br /> The boy, his name Bruno; his age eight and is able to say things with just his eyes that make the fiolm entiurely possible. Without Bruno (expeertly plkayed by Asa Butterfield) the filmn wouldnp;t work. His co -star, the nine yea old Schmuel on the other side of the fenvce ius played by Jack Scanlon who manages to exude sadnewss. The confussion that Bruno has regarding their situation is simply too complicated for Schmuel to explain. The finest performance in the film belongs to Vera Famiga, who plays Bruno's mother and wife to the Commandant at this camp. Like \\"Sophies Choice\\" and Meryl Streep's classic performance in that film, Farmiga builds and devlops over a period of ninety-three minutes until, at the apogee of the film we see her undderstanding reach fruition, just as the rain begins to fall. Her emotional breakdown at this point is raw, honest and something to which every parent can connect.<br />  The film score, composed and performed by James horner (\\"Titanic\\") is a character unto itselfl<br />The entire score is based upon a simple piece he composed that sounds like a gentle folks song. It is diatonic and in three quarter time. He utilizes synthesiers as well as wind instruments to add omonious irony to his music (the synthesisisers were expertly prograqmmed by Ian Underwood and Aaron Martin; the music editor was Dick Bernstein. The score builds momentum and continues, often at battle with itself, disploaying conflict between the characters as well as the situation itself. The music reaches it end with the film on a perfect ubnison which echos, just as the movie does.<br /> The innocence and ignorance of this young boy is as critical to the brilliance of this work as the story of the Titanic. (I speak not just of Cameron's film, but Maury Yeston's musical, \\"a Night to Remember\\" and the three other films made between 1938 and 1984) Herin is a tool where the audience not only knows so much more than Bruno, but that we are anticipating the sadness that ends the film. So we are prepared to cry but when the end does come, it is so shockiung that we aren;t ablke to cry; it';s not possiblke, this ending, though we've taken every step with these two boys and, of courwe (nbecause of our knowledge of what really happened) we know all too well that the ending is quite feasible.<br /> This film is by no means a \\"Sophie's Choice\\" though the horror is just as shocking, but few situations in cinematic history have been able to achieve what \\"Sophie's Choice\\" did. Still, the two films use a similar foundation but are about very different things. Where the ending is horrifyingly shocking and, like  \\"Sophie's Choice,\\" completely unexpected (who in fact could have imagined an ending such as this one) the poignancy of \\"The Boy In Striped Pajamas\\" makes it impossible for this film- and the fame it will generate - to be satirized in any way. Because the innocence and ignorance, as a result of the way his parents have shielded Bruno, is a metaphor for the way in which the population who was aware of the death camps were inactive; complacent and how the same continues to occur day after day from the beginning of recorded time to the continued genocide in Darfur- the world's largest death camp- to which the UN has placed sanctions against while The full force of the American military tore apart Iraq in search of Weapons of Mass Destruction.<br /> The current political winds in the United States suggest that Gay Americans and Female Americans are just as vulnerable. All of these circumstances suggest that you could very well be next. John Boyne's book manages to suggest all of this is his two hundred page fable using a modicum of brilliantly chosen words. His ending:<br /> John Boyle has sub-titled his book, A Fable\\" and it is. His final words are like a double edged sword:<br /> \\"And that's the end of the story of Bruno and his family. Of course all of this<br /> happened a long time ago and nothing like that could ever happen again.<br />  Not in this day and age.\\"<br /><br />The irony of this ending reminds us that this is a fable, but more so, it makes us stop and think of the responsibility that we all owe to anyone who has been maltreated, either in the form of Bruno, Anne Frank, Sophie Zawotoski or Carol Stewart, Amy Fitzpatrick, Dave Pelzer and the millions of others.<br />  As a parent I would have watched this film with both of my daughters as early as sixth grade. Perhaps earlier. Those things that they d0o not understand will gloss over them; they will ask the right questions at the right times and it would be very wise to prepare a parental lesson plan for this because our children must learn of the Hollocaust and by far, this is the best way to introduce it to them I've seem to date. After this, they can read Anne Frank's diary and collefctively with the schools curriculum, they can see. but as we all learneed from Jonathan Demme's \\"silence of the Lambs\\" what the film doesn;t show and is left for our minds to create is often more horrific than a John Carpenter slaher film.<br />  The filmn is not able to end with the same impact as the book, but the ending is still remarkably powerful, filled with painful irony and one image that we watch for a few moments longer than we wish to as we see that there really was no other way this story could end.appened) we know all too well that the ending is quite feasible.<br /> This film is by no means a \\"Sophie's Choice\\" though the horror is just as shocking, but few situations in cinematic history have been able to achieve what \\"Sophie's Choice\\" did.

1592332803|5.0|This book is excellent.<br /><br />It invites one to be reflective about the food choices we automatically make - usually to the exclusion of alternatives e.g. baking with butter and eggs - and provides varied and interesting substitutions to try.<br /><br />Colleen has divided the book into clear sections and there is a huge amount of handy tips throughout (such as: light pans reflect heat and take slightly longer to bake the contents, dark pans absorb heat so watch them more closely, suggestions as to why your cookies were burnt/ too crumbly / not cooked all the way through, why your cake sunk etc). As someone who loves baking but does it sporadically, it is fantastic to have this resource available so I can job my memory and know exactly why something was a failure, and how to improve on it next time.<br /><br />I have made:<br />- the apple pie (which I added rhubarb to, and needed a little more sugar)<br />- the choc-chip cookies (people said these were the best they'd ever had!)<br />- peach cobbler (perfect turnout and easy to follow instructions, as i'd never tried this before)<br /><br />Colleen is compassionate and inspiring - this book is a great addition to my kitchen.

Rather, the content consist of film stills, photographs, storyboards and of course the concept art.<br /><br />There are more photos than concept art, not that it's bad thing. The photos are great actually, showing detailed look at the interiors of Prometheus, some of the sets built such as the Prometheus landing leg, the Pyramid, the head statue, the chamber with the Ampules, sculpted alien props and the landscape photos that were turned into alien environments.<br /><br />The concept art featured are mainly the finalized versions. There aren't many variations for any particular design. For example, there's only one exterior design of Prometheus, a handful of designs for spacesuit, aliens, etc. That's perhaps the downside of this so called art book. I do like the concept art style and rendition which goes really well together with the photos to give the book a very singular unified look.<br /><br />The commentary talks about the important scenes and locations. Those are interesting as they explain the design. The book doesn't dissect the story so whatever you find ambiguous in the movie will still be more or less ambiguous after reading the book.<br /><br />I consider this as more of a production design book. It's not an art book in the strictest sense as there aren't a lot of drawn art. However, I would still recommend it because it's packed with visuals all the way.<br /><br />(There are more pictures of the book on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)
B004G5Z0B4|5.0|So, I am a big PBS watcher when I actually watch TV and happened to turn it on one Sunday night since I had no new book to read. Wow! I was instantly hooked! So many things happened in one episode, nothing like the daytime dramas I used to watch on my lunch hour. I had also just read Ken Follet's \\"When Giants Fall\\" so it was fun to see some major similarities and hear some real historical names mentioned. So I wanted to see more because all I got to see was two Season 2 episodes and the season finale. I have never purchased a show on DVD but this one I had to. I went searching on Amazon and read the reviews about the differences between the UK version and the PBS version. Of course I had to have the original, uncut version! So I ordered this set and was able to set one of my DVD players to region free. Unfortunately it wasn't the DVD/LCD TV combo that I wanted to watch it on. There is no combination available to reset it at this time.<br />I was expecting to see a real extended version of the episodes from Season 1 that I had seen from Netflix but I could not notice a difference. I was under the impression that this boxed set was the original, uncut version and I am enjoying them. I just cannot say that they are not the cut up PBS versions. Nowhere on these discs or packaging does it say PBS and it is for sure Region 1. Unfortunately I have not actually seen many episodes actually aired on PBS to attest that these discs are UK, original versions.<br />There are many reasons people love this show. I cannot say why I love it except for the fact that it is basically a soap opera with great writers, actors, and it has some historical accuracies. My children even enjoy it and it doesn't make me embarrassed of humans (like reality tv does). So I am able to watch it without turning it off if they come in the room. Who would have thought I would be addicted to a Masterpiece Theatre? Who would have thought that millions of Americans would have been addicted to a MasterpieceTheatre show? I know there are many, many great ones. I have just never been sucked in so bad! I love it, can't wait till season 3, and I feel like I did when everyone was waiting for Thursday nights to watch a new episode of \\"Friends\\". It's that good! I hope no one reads this without seeing an episode. When everyone says something is amazing before I have actually experienced it, then I see it.....it is pretty much ruined for me. I can't see what the fuss is all about. Hopefully you are just here looking for the best version to help you get your fix like I was!
B0033WDCRA|5.0|I had recently read a review about the 16 minute version of RELAX and decided to buy the cd...absolutely LOVE LOVE IT!! Great quality and am so happy with it!!!
B000VSAEYI|5.0|This pool is an excellent price for the size and quality.  My 18 month old is in love with it and when there are other kids at the house they all love it too- and it has stood up to a lot of abuse so far without springing a leak.  It comes with all these cute little blow up toys and the sprinklers on the sides can be on or off.  FYI you definitely need an air compressor to blow it up.  It is kind of a process to blow it up and then to take the air out to put it away but that is the same for any blow up pool of that size.

B007MJ9LA2|4.0|I spent a good portion of my life listening to and following Santana. For me from '69-'92 the band was at it's creative peak and the music was highly creative. In all of my music collection; four of my all time favorite cds are the first four Santana releases (\\"Santana\\", \\"Abraxas\\", \\"Santana III\\" and \\"Caravanserai\\").<br /><br />In 1999 \\"The Supernatural\\" came out I stepped away- it was a blatant attempt to gain sales by having popular artists of the time guest on a cd. For years to come that was his formuala and it grew old fast. To me he had lost integrity as an artist.  This Culminated in an all time low; the cover cd \\"Guitar Heaven\\" (see my review).<br /><br />\\"Shape Shifter\\" has come out with mixed reviews; but for the first time in over a decade, I did purchase a Santana album and I like it. I had really liked \\"Blues for Salvador\\" in '87 and this new cd could in many ways be a companion piece. It is a return to form of the Santana that I knew and liked as a child of the '70's. As an instrumental cd it is creative and both invigorating and relaxing to listen to. As with so many classic Santana Cds it is a great summer listen.<br /><br />My favorite cut is \\"Metatron\\" which sounds like it could be an elegiac opening song for a sporting event. \\"Angelica Faith\\" \\"In the Light of a New Day\\" and \\"canela\\" could easily fit on any album from the classic Santana period.<br /><br />This is a thoroughly enjoyable cd that I find myself listening to again and again. I would love to see a follow up cd in the same vein as \\"Caravanserai\\"...Welcome back Santana!
0802473156|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book and learned a lot from it. Things became a lot clearer in my relationship. It's as if a huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders because now I know why my partner and I feel and behave in certain ways. The stories are interesting and touch on many different scenarios I'm sure many of us experience. This book breaks things down clearly. Although repetitive at times, I feel this repetition is necessary to reinforce what I just read. This book also offers many simple (but not easy) solutions.
0545265355|5.0|I devoured the Hunger Games-- was ignited to complete Girl on Fire, yet was singing another tune by the time I got to Mockingjay.<br /><br />Yes, this series is geared towards the young teen, but I found the themes of survival, using wits and living in dystopic time was well worth the effort. Since I had seen the movie first, I was a bit bemused that I now had images of such diverse characters already IN my mind. Cinna was a charmer, Seneca was slimey, yet fashonable and the beloved Katniss was keen and a killer.<br /><br />All three books had their strengths and foibles, including an adult (me) shaking her head when the delightfully independent and intrepid protaganist chooses a comaparatively wimpy, damaged mate. I also loved the descriptions of food, fashion and forests and yet the most memorable character dies early in the timeline.<br /><br />You too should read the Hunger Games trilogy. Since I already dontated my Hunger Games copy to our county library--as the request list is so long. I just may have to purchase another set someday. Enjoy!
B007IXWKUK|2.0|OK - I love a good chick read, a good love story to read on the weekend that has great characters and story.  This book has a crazy guy and a wimpy girl, and really just drove me nuts the whole book.  Not interested in reading book 3.  If you are looking for a little romance, or even a spice romance read - there are much better books out there.<br /><br />I love books of all kinds - this one didn't end up on one of my recommend lists.  Sorry
B007RP4D5Y|5.0|First listen left me a little cold, but this record has quickly grown on me and I love it now. Highly recommended music that will quench your thirst for something worthy. After about three listens you'll be humming these tunes all day.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Really, just terrible,  terrible writing.  The line 'He's very wealthy,  but also complicated and mercurial' comes to mind.  I hate this book and the fact millions of people enjoy this trash
0345803507|5.0|some what twisted, but good.  Love the ending.  I couldnt put the books down. I am a slow reader, but read it 1 week.
B004XQO90O|5.0|This is a very good film with a sci-fi story with an unusual plot and good acting. It raises many issues such as should we be able to experiment on humans when to do so would help mankind, what is time, can we change the past, how can we affect the future, can we hide information from the family of dead soldiers, and what is heroism. Viewers are pulled into the drama wandering what is going on, just as the hero of the film wonders. He is told some things, but not everything, but he figures it out. The film has a good surprise ending.
B005LAIHRC|5.0|\\"Rock Of Ages\\" is great! This is how the story goes: Set in 1987 Los Angeles, Drew and Sherrie are two young people chasing their dreams in the big city. When they meet, it's love at first sight, though their romance will face a series of challenges.<br /><br />The cast led by Julianne Hough (as Sherrie), Diego Boneta (as Drew), Tom Cruise (as Stacee Jaxx), Alec Baldwin (as Dennis Dupree), Russell Brand (as Lonny), Catherine Zeta-Jones (as Patricia Whitmore), Paul Giamatti (as Paul Gill), Bryan Cranston (as Mike Whitmore), Malin Akerman (as Constance Sack) & Mary J. Blige (as Justice) is great. The directing by Adam Shankman (who also produced) is great. The screenplay (based on the musical book by Chris D'Arienzo) by D'Arienzo, Justin Theroux & Allan Loeb is great.<br /><br />The original score by Adam Anders & Peter Astrom is great. The music supervised by Matthew Rush Sullivan is great. The cinematography by Bojan Bazelli is great. The film editing by Emma E. Hickox is great. The casting by Juel Bestrop & Seth Yanklewitz is great. The production design by Jon Hutman is great. The set decoration by K.C. Fox is great. The costume design by Rita Ryack is great. The set dressing by Stephen P. Durante, Melissa Pamela Jones, Emilio Saez & Daniel Williams is great. The assistant art direction by Rosa Palomo is great.<br /><br />This is a great adaptation (musical) of a Broadway musical. This is a fun, entertaining and well-made film that has terrific songs that are well-sung by the cast. This is also a great film for the summer season. This is another musical hit from the director of 2007's \\"Hairspray\\". Also, a great return to musicals for Catherine Zeta-Jones as well, since her Oscar-winning performance in 2002's Oscar-winner Best Picture \\"Chicago\\".

B003V4AK8E|5.0|Okay, look... I had a PS1 when they first hit stores. I had several PS2s throughout the life of the system. i am familiar with the Playstation controller, and I used to really like it... Until I got my Xbox 360 at launch. I'm sorry, but the Xbox 360 controller is one of the best ever made, and I've had every console available in North America since Pong.<br /><br />So when I migrated to PS3 from my Xbox 360, I was underwhelmed by the Dual Shock 2 controller. While the motion control is kind of neat, the controller is too small, too light, and now I feel like the sticks are in the wrong places. Over the years, the D-pad has become little more than another set of buttons for most games, and having it placed where it is on the Dual Shock just feels... wrong. Sorry, Sony, but Microsoft did ONE thing better with the Xbox 360, and that one thing they did MUCH better. I even use an Xbox controller for my PC gaming.<br /><br />I found my enjoyment of games like Red Dead Redemption and Skyrim to be dwindling with the Playstation controller. I just couldn't get into it... So I was thrilled when I found one of these Pro Elite wireless controllers in my local game store. I had credit to spend, and I figured this was a good thing to take a chance on.<br /><br />Of course, third party controllers are often junk. I was prepared for the worst, but I was pleasantly surprised. This feels like an Xbox 360 controller, except that it's a bit lighter and doesn't have the true triggers of a 360 controller. Still, the triggers are meatier and better than the light, fluffy ones on the Dual Shock, and that helped my gaming immensely.<br /><br />So here's the pro-con list:<br /><br />PRO:<br />Feels like an Xbox 360 controller.<br />Buttons light up so you can tell Square from Circle or Triangle from X (I'm used to ABXY!)<br />Rechargeable, and comes with the necessary cable.<br />Has its own receiver dongle. Doesn't require Bluetooth channel.<br />Analog sticks have thumb-divets instead of being rounded like the Dual Shock.<br />Rubberized grip is a nice bonus.<br /><br />CON:<br />Rechargeable battery makes it lighter than Xbox 360 controller and limits lifespan of controller.<br />Wireless dongle takes up a USB port and replaces it with a mini-USB pass-through port.<br />Triggers are more like Dual Shock than Xbox 360.<br />Battery is dead when you first get it. Must be charged before use.<br />D-Pad is a bit stiff, and may not be great for Street Fighter combos if you're into that.<br />Playstation 3 doesn't tell you battery level on this controller.<br /><br />So there you go. Lots of good. Some bad depending on what you're looking for. I love mine, but I'm not a typical gamer. I don't get into twitch games or fighting games (anymore) and so for my casual sandbox gaming this is just what I needed and wanted. As long as the rechargeable battery holds out, I'll be happy.<br /><br />Final verdict: If you're an Xbox 360 gamer who migrated to PS3, you may want to grab this. If you're a Sony loyalist, then this will probably feel like some sort of betrayal to the Sony plan for your life.eing rounded like the Dual Shock.<br />Rubberized grip is a nice bonus.<br /><br />CON:<br />Rechargeable battery makes it lighter than Xbox 360 controller and limits lifespan of controller.<br />Wireless dongle takes up a USB port and replaces it with a mini-USB pass-through port.<br />Triggers are more like Dual Shock than Xbox 360.<br />Battery is dead when you first get it.

Sammo Hung,Lo Meng (Five Venoms,Kid With Golden Arm),Fung Hak On(Magnificent Butcher,Last Hurrah for Chivalry,Five Shaolin Masters),Darren Shalavi,(Mortal Kombat Web Series,Tai Chi Boxer)Kent Cheng(Once Upon a Time in China),Dennis To Yue(Ip Man Legend Begins),Huang Xiao Ming (Sammo Hung's son).<br /><br />  After years of Ip Man's escape from Mainland China.He relocates to Hong Kong to live in poverty.Ip is trying to make ends meet and wants to teach Wing Chun to students.After he has some recognition he must get permission from the other masters to teach and prove himself that he can.One of the masters is played by Sammo Hung who is an expert at Hung Fist.At the same time Hong Kong is ruled by the British and make the Chinese work for little money.There is an event boxing match of Britain's famous Boxer Twister (Shahlavi) who is an arrogant selfish bully.He ridicules the Chinese martial artists at the boxing event and ends up hurting a couple.Master Hung decides to counter and go into a match with Twister.Twister has killed Master Hung in the ring and now Ip Man must prove that Chinese martial arts can defeat Western boxing.<br /><br /> The fighting is superb.Combines both Wire Fu and Kung Fu and the editing never looked better.Donnie gets to fight with Shaw Brother's legends Lo Meng and Fung Hak On,even though the fights were short and they are both in their 60s,they are still in top form.Sammo's fight with Donnie is different from the one in Killzone because they fight in a round table and have very limited space.Later on they become friends instead of wanting to kill each other.Huang Xiao Ming plays Donnie's disciple Wong Shun Leng.His fighting isn't bad but to be Sammo's son he's got to prove himself.Dennis To from the Ip Man prequel plays Sammo Hung's main disciple.It is one of his first films and he later proves in the prequel that he can throw down some serious Wing Chun and can also be a major kung fu star like Wu Jing.This movie put Darren Shalahvi's career on the map.Appearing in the Webisode of Mortal Kombat playing Kano and fighting along with Michael Jai White.Darren had more roles in B movies with Steve Austin and Steven Seagal.At least he is out there being recognized instead of being in crappy cameos in Zack Snyder movies like 300 and Watchmen.If you blink you probably missed his cameo appearance.This is one of the best Kung Fu movies in years along with True Legend,Ip Man prequel,Reign of Assassins.Donnie is in talks to do more Ip Man movies so stay tuned.be Sammo's son he's got to prove himself.Dennis To from the Ip Man prequel plays Sammo Hung's main disciple.It is one of his first films and he later proves in the prequel that he can throw down some serious Wing Chun and can also be a major kung fu star like Wu Jing.This movie put Darren Shalahvi's career on the map.Appearing in the Webisode of Mortal Kombat playing Kano and fighting along with Michael Jai White.Darren had more roles in B movies with Steve Austin and Steven Seagal.At least he is out there being recognized instead of being in crappy cameos in Zack Snyder movies like 300 and Watchmen.If you blink you probably missed his cameo appearance.This is one of the best Kung Fu movies in years along with True Legend,Ip Man prequel,Reign of Assassins.Donnie is in talks to do more Ip Man movies so stay tuned.
B004N1S25C|5.0|4.5 really. The end of the book made me think that part should be labeled \\"Reasons Why You Should Self-Publish\\". Pretty sure that wasn't King's intent. Anyway, great book even for those who aren't that interested in the writing part.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Well, I did it.<br /><br />I succumbed to the hype, the word of mouth raving (mostly from girls), and the various bestseller lists around the world and I read Fifty Shades of Grey. This is like back in 8th grade, when I just took the leap and read [[ASIN:031613290X The Twilight Saga Complete Collection]], of which this has roots in (but I won't go into the whole fan fiction debate). I am not the target demographic for either of these books (I'm a 17 year old guy who likes mainstream and literary fiction), but when I read Twilight I at least appreciated what it was worth, and I know a lot of what people say about it isn't true.<br /><br />What a lot of the reviews say about Fifty Shades of Grey, however, is true. Too true, almost.<br /><br />But why, you ask, am I writing a review when I agree with what a lot of the reviews on here already say? Well, it's simply because I would like to go into extreme detail of why this book is so terrible to me, what very small value it *does* have, and hopefully elicit some conversation and discussion in the comments section from some of those people who gave it 5 star reviews.<br /><br />The book starts off simple enough: Anastasia Steele (not the pornstar! I know, the name throws you off) must fill in for her best friend Kate in an interview with Christian Grey, a billionaire who also wants to cure world hunger. From their first interview, an electric tension is present that eventually culminates itself in what this book is famous for: BDSM. The first fifty or so pages of this novel were very compelling and had me hooked. I think I read about 1/3 of this novel in one sitting. I was finally starting to understand why this book had sold so much. I was so excited that it was going to keep up the pace and that I was going to have a whole new, exciting trilogy to read.<br /><br />Excuse me for a second while my age shows through. LOL. I had a rude awakening to that feeling right when their \\"relationship\\" begins.<br /><br />The problem with this book is that the first few sex scenes are hot or whatever, but essentially they all develop into a \\"Oh, and then he's gonna do her *here* in *this way*\\" and other forms of wish fulfillment. One of the scenes literally had me gagging. I mean, okay, I understand Piano Sex, Bondage Sex, Boathouse Sex, and the thought of IHOP Sex, but Sex while Ana is on her period? I mean, COME ON. That's horribly disgusting. Are women into that? The most offensive exchange of dialogue in literature occurs when Ana goes \\" I'm bleeding.\\" and Christian replies \\" I don't care.\\"<br /><br />*shudder* uggh.<br /><br />And that's probably my main problem with this novel. Is that after that first third of the book, it becomes just mindless sex. And the sad realization that all the good things going for the novel up to that point (Christian's mysterious past, Ana's bright curiosity, the circle of friends who are nice characters) are just to provide sexual tension. They are all written for the single payoff of cheap mom-porn sex.<br /><br />And the writing is, in the wise words of our trust narrator, double crap.At times, the simple prose manages to get the job done and move the story along, others, it drags it down and drives us slo-mo through not-so-hot sex scenes. Often times, Ana interjects with a quick \\"Jeez\\" or \\"Crap\\" or an italicized expletive, which aren't believable or even relevant half the time. Throughout the entire book Ana keeps discussing how she is \\"not the kind of girl\\" who would be into BDSM. Well, Ana, honey, I hate to break it to you, but if you sign a contract to be in a relationship with chains, whips, and bondage, well, that kind of makes you *that* kind of girl.<br /><br />Anastasia Steele is an annoying narrator, and quite inconsistent. For example, she compares herself to her beautiful roommate, and talks about how ugly she is. She keeps going on and on about how beautiful she wishes she was. But then, she gets asked out by three different guys in the first fifty pages, one of which has asked her out before, many times, and his asking her out is a tradition of theirs. Trust me, these men are not asking Ana out for her personality. She comes across as cardboard and tacky as a MacDonald's happy people, and looks as convincing when she smiles. She plays similar tactics when it comes to her job (If her resume is so awful, how does she get it?), her GPA (which Kate says is High, but Ana still feels inferior to Kate), and her broken-but-okay family (She loves her mom, but lived with one of her mother's husbands who is not her dad).<br /><br />Alright, one could argue, many people want to read this book for the sex, and don't care about the rest. Well, let me tell you, my ventures into romance and erotic literature are few and far between, but I have read many a scene more sexy and erotic than even the best sex scene in this novel.<br /><br />For starters, I know there is nothing erotic about the words \\"penis\\" and \\"vagina\\", but Anastasia (and through her E.L. James) use ridiculous euphemisms that make me laugh more than get hot. For example, Ana only uses the v-word once the entire novel. Every other time she says \\" down *there*\\" or \\"my sex\\". I mean, I wasn't aware that, caught up in the moment, people think things like \\" Oh he's going to kiss my sex.\\" Like, what? Do people even talk like that?!<br /><br />Oh. And there's the other thing. The very, terrible Ohs. There's the \\"Oh please\\" when Ana wants to have an orgasm, there's the \\"Oh yes sir\\" when Christian has a new move, and then there's the internal narration, italicized \\"Oh\\" that just happens all the time. Using my neat Kindle feature, I can inform you that there are 444 uses of the word \\"Oh\\" in this novel. My guess is about 350 of those are sexual.  All in all, its a tad redundant.<br /><br />This book, however, in its sex scenes, contains the most annoying thing I have ever read in a novel. Ever. Like, this made me laugh out loud, because it was so stupid. So, one could categorize Fifty Shades as an \\"Erotic\\" novel, right? Well, throughout the sex scenes, Ana likes to say things like \\"He kissed my belly button, it was so erotic\\" or \\" He tied me up, it was so erotic\\" (neither of those are exact quotes). I'm sorry, but when you are shooting for something being erotic, a good writer should just *make* it erotic and just let the reader think to themselves \\"this is so erotic.\\"<br /><br />I mean, literally, that is the most obnoxious thing ever. It's like if Jay Gatsby stood and the end of his dock, with the flashing green light from across the bay, and then whispered to Nick Carraway, \\"This is so literary.\\" Or Harry Potter riding a hippogriff for the first time, exclaiming to his friends \\"This is fantastic!\\"<br /><br />Like, could she be any more blunt?<br /><br />This is how the entire book boils down: E.L. James pulling out all stops to do something to impress the reader. From wish fulfillment fantasies to some handsome men, everything in this book is trying too hard. And in the process, the few good things that could make this book outstanding are lost in the process.<br /><br />The relationship between Ana and Christian, for example, is fascinating. If E.L. James had gone more in depth into the psychology of said relationship, this book could have been the next [[ASIN:0679723161 Lolita, 50th Anniversary Edition]] or [[ASIN:1456314874 Venus in Furs]]. Instead, all that amazing sexual tension is used to make the sex \\"hotter\\", which it doesn't. The reader is left wanting and wondering more of how Christian was formed.<br /><br />Christian, by the way, has a very interesting past. Abusive mothers, neighbors with secrets, some interesting scars. But how much of this does the reader find out? None. Or, well, close to none. You find out its existence and some minor details, but there is no closure to it and there is no explanation for why its there and how exactly it has shaped him.<br /><br />I'm telling you: all this crap is there so that Christian can be a \\"hunk with a troubled past\\" for Ana \\"the innocent healer\\" to make love to, blah blah blah. It all comes down to making Christian hotter, instead of making him an interesting character. This is immensely frustrating as a reader because naturally, being trained by reading quality books, I wanted to know more about Christian and his past and his mindset. But nope. Just some more sex.<br /><br />Throughout this novel, I just had to keep asking myself, \\"Wait, what?\\"<br /><br />I cannot imagine what was sneaking through James' mind when she wrote this novel other than \\"let's make some hot sex.\\" But the sex is terrible, the story is worse, and the only interesting character has traits that literally come down to sex and sex alone, which, if you haven't heard, is terrible. It's a vicious cycle, and it makes me wonder how this story is continued into two more books, because there wasn't enough plot to make it through this book without being immensely bored.<br /><br />Before I leave you, I would like to touch on the ending. It is not a payoff like readers have come to expect. It is a drop-of-the-pin moodswing that just *happens* and causes other stuff to just *occur* and then there is room for a sequel. HELLO. Hollywood tries this all the time. And it is stupid. It is a sellout way to create room for more.<br /><br />E.L. James, where is your integrity as a writer? An author? A storyteller?<br /><br />Books were meant to tell stories. I don't care if you would like to include pornographic themes as well, go ahead, its your book, not mine. But make the time spent in the land of your novel worthwhile for the reader, and make the entry price of your book value the experience your reader will have.<br /><br />If I wanted cheap, terrible porn, I wouldn't have to spend 9.99. I could just search the internet. And all that porn comes with free bonus viruses, too, which, to be honest, might be more interesting than the characters in this novel.<br /><br />Amidst all of this crap, there is one good thing about this book. Well, actually, its better, than good, it's pretty great, I'd say. Say what you want about the book itself, but it *is* getting people reading. I know a lot of people who don't normally read that are picking this up. And you know what? It doesn't matter what they are reading, but it does matter *that* they are reading. So, keep this in libraries. Keep it on the bestseller list. I don't care.<br /><br />But I hope that this novel at least opens new horizons for those who read it. It is absolute crap. One of the worst books I have read in a long time. But its getting people to read, which is excellent. So, to anyone out there who has just finished the Fifty Shades trilogy and wants more, quality stuff? I recommend you check out [[ASIN:0441018238 Sookie Stackhouse 8-copy Boxed Set (Sookie Stackhouse/True Blood)]], which has vampires, but is outstanding and has some great mystery elemts, or maybe even something like [[ASIN:0385343191 Betrayal: A Novel]] or anything else by Danielle Steel. And maybe, then, you can start moving toward some modern literary hits like [[ASIN:0345802934 1Q84: 3 Volume Boxed Set (Vintage International)]] or [[ASIN:0812977866 Super Sad True Love Story: A Novel]], which both have deep themes of love in them.<br /><br />****<br /><br />I would also like to ask, as a courtesy, that if you are a super huge lover of this book and series, that you please comment down below and talk to me. Really. I'd like to have an intelligent discussion with someone who likes this book, because I cannot wrap my head around it. Please and Thank You.categorize Fifty Shades as an \\"Erotic\\" novel, right? Well, throughout the sex scenes, Ana likes to say things like \\"He kissed my belly button, it was so erotic\\" or \\" He tied me up, it was so erotic\\" (neither of those are exact quotes). I'm sorry, but when you are shooting for something being erotic, a good writer should just *make* it erotic and just let the reader think to themselves \\"this is so erotic.\\"<br /><br />I mean, literally, that is the most obnoxious thing ever. It's like if Jay Gatsby stood and the end of his dock, with the flashing green light from across the bay, and then whispered to Nick Carraway, \\"This is so literary.\\" Or Harry Potter riding a hippogriff for the first time, exclaiming to his friends \\"This is fantastic!\\"<br /><br />Like, could she be any more blunt?<br /><br />This is how the entire book boils down: E.L. James pulling out all stops to do something to impress the reader. From wish fulfillment fantasies to some handsome men, everything in this book is trying too hard. And in the process, the few good things that could make this book outstanding are lost in the process.<br /><br />The relationship between Ana and Christian, for example, is fascinating. If E.L. James had gone more in depth into the psychology of said relationship, this book could have been the next [[ASIN:0679723161 Lolita, 50th Anniversary Edition]] or [[ASIN:1456314874 Venus in Furs]]. Instead, all that amazing sexual tension is used to make the sex \\"hotter\\", which it doesn't. The reader is left wanting and wondering more of how Christian was formed.<br /><br />Christian, by the way, has a very interesting past. Abusive mothers, neighbors with secrets, some interesting scars. But how much of this does the reader find out? None. Or, well, close to none. You find out its existence and some minor details, but there is no closure to it and there is no explanation for why its there and how exactly it has shaped him.<br /><br />I'm telling you: all this crap is there so that Christian can be a \\"hunk with a troubled past\\" for Ana \\"the innocent healer\\" to make love to, blah blah blah. It all comes down to making Christian hotter, instead of making him an interesting character. This is immensely frustrating as a reader because naturally, being trained by reading quality books, I wanted to know more about Christian and his past and his mindset. But nope. Just some more sex.<br /><br />Throughout this novel, I just had to keep asking myself, \\"Wait, what?\\"<br /><br />I cannot imagine what was sneaking through James' mind when she wrote this novel other than \\"let's make some hot sex.\\" But the sex is terrible, the story is worse, and the only interesting character has traits that literally come down to sex and sex alone, which, if you haven't heard, is terrible. It's a vicious cycle, and it makes me wonder how this story is continued into two more books, because there wasn't enough plot to make it through this book without being immensely bored.<br /><br />Before I leave you, I would like to touch on the ending. It is not a payoff like readers have come to expect. It is a drop-of-the-pin moodswing that just *happens* and causes other stuff to just *occur* and then there is room for a sequel. HELLO. Hollywood tries this all the time. And it is stupid. It is a sellout way to create room for more.<br /><br />E.L. James, where is your integrity as a writer? An author? A storyteller?<br /><br />Books were meant to tell stories. I don't care if you would like to include pornographic themes as well, go ahead, its your book, not mine. But make the time spent in the land of your novel worthwhile for the reader, and make the entry price of your book value the experience your reader will have.<br /><br />If I wanted cheap, terrible porn, I wouldn't have to spend 9.99. I could just search the internet. And all that porn comes with free bonus viruses, too, which, to be honest, might be more interesting than the characters in this novel.<br /><br />Amidstall of this crap, there is one good thing about this book. Well, actually, its better, than good, it's pretty great, I'd say. Say what you want about the book itself, but it *is* getting people reading. I know a lot of people who don't normally read that are picking this up. And you know what? It doesn't matter what they are reading, but it does matter *that* they are reading. So, keep this in libraries. Keep it on the bestseller list. I don't care.<br /><br />But I hope that this novel at least opens new horizons for those who read it. It is absolute crap. One of the worst books I have read in a long time. But its getting people to read, which is excellent.

B007URVZJ6|5.0|Operation should be easy in every cases. Seamless operating  ways might be in prevail through this kind of books after deep consideration and long term experiences, I believe.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I've always enjoyed puzzles and currently have no space. This game gives multiple numbers of pieces and designs to choose from. Highly recommended for any puzzle fanatics.
B007SGM084|4.0|After my initial shock of the BDSM I found the book informative about the bondage,submissive,<br />dominance masochism lifestyle.  The first book was shocking in it's descriptions of his<br />lifestyle, but after he met Anastasia and fell in love, I found the rest of the books<br />fascinating.  I did enjoy the series and found I could not put it down.  I thought it was<br />well written.  The story line was interesting.  I found myself feeling the same way Anastasia<br />did about \\"Mrs. Robinson\\".  The book could have left out more of the explicit sexual scenes<br />and still been good.  I learned a lot and found the book to be a good read.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|Very good program, only complaint is that if you want different fonts you must buy a whole new package priced at $4.99.
B005LAII0I|3.0|I like the Snow White fairytale.  The combination of dwarves, poisoned apples, and a beautiful princess is a definite classic and one that many have been in love with for ages.  And so there are a lot of remakes of the tale, almost more than any other fairytale out there except perhaps Cinderella.  This one was sweet and innocent and good fun, but ultimately very hokey.<br /><br />Snow White has grown up in the castle a shut-in after her father's disappearance.  Once a spoiled daughter she's now subject to the whims of her step-mother the Queen, who is only concerned with her beauty.  The story is actually told through the Queen's eyes, sort of, and so we get a glimpse behind why she thinks she does and wants to oppress Snow White.  Using tax money to fund grand parties, the Queen is quickly bringing the kingdom to ruin, and when Snow White finally finds out how the people are surviving, she vows to do something about it.  Which of course brings the attention of the Queen on her and she must run for her life, only to be found by seven dwarves, who have an interesting work all their own.<br /><br />Characters:<br />Snow White:  Lily Collins<br />The Queen:  Julia Roberts<br />Prince Alcott:  Armie Hammer<br />Brighton:  Nathan Lane<br />The King:  Sean Bean<br /><br />I can't say that any of the actors were well suited to their roles.  Julia Roberts was simply too nice to be an evil Queen, in fact she was more vain and self centered and hardly seemed capable of doing any real harm.  Prince Alcott I just couldn't figure out.  Sure Armie Hammer was nice to look at, but I require a little more from an actor than that.  Not much, but a little more.  Lily Collins as Snow White was ok.  She had a soft spoken way about her and definitely was able to put off that naive vibe.  I do think that Nathan Lane as Brighton was good.  He was the perfect toady for the Queen and always licking her boots.  The Seven Dwarves were definitely individuals and pretty funny, but I just couldn't figure out why one of them was a cowboy.  It seemed a little strange especially with some of the other pairings.<br /><br />So I did say the movie was hokey.  And it was.  Even the special effects contributed to that.  Although they weren't used often, just seeing little animated stars and such around a characters head causes me to groan a bit.  A little over the top and it was almost like the director was making fun of his own movie and couldn't take it seriously.  You kind of have to have one or the other, because mixing a serious with comedic elements like that confuses the watcher.  At least id did me.  I did enjoy that Snow White could take care of herself in this one.  Much better than having to constantly be rescued by the prince.  She could do anything that he could do, albeit with more dramatic flair.<br /><br />A cute movie, but not the best remake of the Snow White story.  I think it's definitely appropriate for younger audiences and probably a good family movie to watch.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012't figure out why one of them was a cowboy.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Its just what I needed a simple and basic calculator for my Fire! Its beautifully designed and very easy to use!  Its a Must-Have app! (Missing Square Root Button)
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Heard a lot of hype about this book and was disappointed.  Not all that well written.  We need more love and less violence and women should not knowingly allow themselves to be in a possible harmful and controlling situation.  Hope young women don't think this is the norm.
B006M9NJFG|3.0|So, I finally bought a canteen.  I bought this for a few reasons but have to score it 3 stars.  Here's why;  It get's 1 Star for amount of volume it can hold 1 LTR.  It gets 1 Star for the case, and it get's 1 Star for the aluminum cup that it come with.  THAT Aluminum cup is the biggest reason it bought it for $35 @ Dicks Sporting goods (Not a fan by the way)  Anyway, I would have given it 5 Stars, but really $35s!!!!  I didn't know this existed but since I'm going camping in 2 days and I like to be prepared!  I DIDN'T WAIT FOR THE $26 one to come from Amazon, Sorry AMZN!  But I will say for the $26 on this site, that's still too much $$$.  It's Plastic!  Neoprene, and Aluminum!  I doubt the thing cost $3.00 to manufacture! INCLUDING LABOR!!!  So, 3 Stars!  AND YES I HAD ALTERNATIVES....like the old school military one w/Belt!-for $11.99  And oh...FYI, I am not a fan of Bear, although I have watched his shows, the BEAR \\"LINE\\" PRODUCTS are not ones I'd pay for because of the name!  As I compared this to the other options I had (in my area looking through every EMS/TSA/DSG's) this to me was the best and most practice to my needs.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I have never read the books first off. The plot and special effects were great. The length was reasonable and could even been longer since the story was amazing. This is a fantasy and Indiana Jones type of movie. The acting is great and character development moves on at a good pace. Wish the movie had done better at the blockbuster so we can have a sequel. Only time will tell.
B004UID2LC|3.0|I don't know if the cause of this could be my connection, but everytime I want to open the app, I'd have to force close and if I want to download songs/videos, it wouldn't work!
B00846REIS|4.0|I read another book that is also getting a lot of hype and I greatly disliked it, but Bared to You is one I'm glad to see rising up the hourly bestseller list. This is a better written book with a more detailed back story to the characters. And I wouldn't say I don't find the characters a little annoying, but given their history, I can understand why they are having the issues they are having. There could have been a few less written sex scenes because that started to get a bit tiresome, but I believe more will be explained about their problems, especially Gideon's, and that may also explain their sexual need for each other.<br /><br />For those that didn't like the other book, the one that shall not be named, I would suggest giving this book a shot. At least it's better writing for a couple of bucks less.<br /><br />Update: this interview will help clear up some misconceptions[...]
1592537251|5.0|THE ART OF URBN SKETCHING is a book that absolutely overflows with wonderful black and white and colorful drawings.  The different artistic styles on each page gives the reader new and exciting views of urban living and makes one want to grab a handful of pencils and a pad of paper and hit the streets immediately.  There is something for everyone in this book.  The short but interesting profile on each artist only adds to the energy of the book which is already alive with flow and movement.  There is much to be learned from these talented street artists who so generously share their work with anyone willing to look.  If you can't get this book right now, put it on your wish list for later but be sure to keep it in mind.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The author has woven a very beautiful love story that becomes riveting.  The over-the-top,graphic sex I found to actually be necessary to the story line because of the nature of the characters. And, because of the enticing love story I necessarily had to read the second book. Loved the entire trilogy--but especially the first two books.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|LOVED the first two books. This book was a little disappointing. I won't spoil it, but this book was good up until the end. The ending seems a bit rush. Through all, this book no longer houses the strong, brave, inspiring Katniss we all love, wished that it could be rewritten.

B006B9TLT0|5.0|I got this the day it came out and it is just absolutely amazing! This Target exclusive contains the same CD as the regular version of this live album but the DVD is what makes it worth it with three exclusive live performances not included on the standard version of the DVD. The bonus performance of \\"Ours\\" is neatly cut in between \\"Long Live\\" and \\"Fifteen\\". \\"Nashville\\" and \\"Sweet Escape\\" are exclusive bonus performances on the bonus features along with the \\"On the Set with Taylor Swift: Mean\\" which originally aired on CMT. This is great for those, like me, who like to get the store exclusives which feature these great bonuses. If you are one this CD/DVD Target exclusive of \\"Speak Now World Tour Live\\" is definitively for you.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for this game to be free. everyone should get this game its really cool and fun for everyone.  very addicting
B007PTJOV0|1.0|worst app on here. fix the faulty controls and the retarded platforming and maybe it could earn a higher rating.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I bought this (and a couple of other designs) for my niece that I will be visiting soon.  It is adorable!  I hope she loves the functionality of it as much as I'll love looking at her using it.  I really like the fact that it is machine washable.  I'm going to suggest to the Momma to either keep it in the memory box when the baby outgrows using it.

0143121006|5.0|MIDNIGHT IN PEKING has all of the elements of a great crime novel: an innocent victim brutally murdered, a variety of possible perpetrators with mysterious motives, and a fascinating historical setting.  But Paul French's fascinating book is not fiction.  It is a compelling and carefully researched account of the 1930s murder of Pamela Werner, daughter of a retired British diplomat living in pre-War China.  The telling is reminiscent of an Erik Larson book (e.g. DEVIL IN THE WHITE CITY) in that it presents two parallel stories, one the investigation of Pamela's macabre demise and the other the turmoil of Peking, threatened by warlords, war-hungry Japan and the emerging Communists.  At times the prose bogs a bit, as French seems to try to stretch the tale unnecessarily.  Nevertheless, it's a worthy effort and a great read.
B0086700CM|4.0|Love this game! It's literally SO addicting! I play it all the time. The only thing I dislike is that if often glitches up a little and makes me miss a jump or turn when I'm doing good!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Really good app for simple math. If your looking for a scientific or calculus app, this is not the one.
0470876417|5.0|I can't really add anything beyond what has already been written by previous reviewers. This is a great book to help you work through the problems of making a business \\"work\\". The discovery of the product, value, customer, etc as a process is laid out in an easy to understand format.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00881VLCE|4.0|It is okay. I wish there was a way to change the size of the pieces though.  Other than that I really like it. And there isn't any pieces to lose lol

B00563M11M|3.0|Been a Vimes fan for ever-so-long. Been a Terry fan for even longer. Can't say I loved this book - Vimes seems to have developed some unsavoury personality kinks. Maybe this makes him more rounded, more human? Naaah, just seems to make him less believable - he has lost some authenticity, some integrity... But. It's Vimes. And it's Terry. Still the most kick-ass duo since Smith and Jones. Or Ren and Stimpy. Love them both.
B000BNTM96|2.0|Item described as 2 disk audio CD set. I love QOTSA as was really excited to recieve some live recordings of such awesome songs. What i recieved was a live DVD. still pretty awesome, but I want to be able to listen in my car or at work. I was disapointed.
B005NACYQU|3.0|Enjoyable book, not top-notch Gaiman. The final denouement was kinda predictable... but satisfying, none-the-less. Some of the meanderings with the gods through their adventures grew tedious (I wanted to shoot them all at several points), pleased I made the effort to see it through though.
0307279189|5.0|Born to Run is a truly great story. The grueling training and races that take place are phenomenal, but so is the story of the Tarahumara Indians. Their ability to run hundreds of miles with little more than a piece of car tire strapped to their feet is amazing. The book reads like an anthropological case study. There are so many characters including the mysterious Caballo Blanco who recently passed away. This story should be made into a movie. I would love to see Born to Run come to life on the big screen. While the inspirational story of competing in Ultra Marathons is superb, the underlying focus on culture and gender is absolutely brilliant. I have recommended this book to many friends and family members and I will continue to recommend it. Christopher McDougall is a great writer and should really consider writing Born to Run II.
B0086700CM|5.0|I really love this app. I don't know what makes me love ot but I do love it. I just think its so much fun.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I must say, I was highly disappointed with this book. Many of my friends in college (who are going for their degrees to become English teacher) have been raving about this book for weeks; encouraging everyone they know to read it. Going on their word, I picked up Fifty Shades of Grey at my local grocery store. Two chapters in, I knew buying this book was a BIG mistake.<br /><br />Normally I feel that I must finish a book in order to give it a proper review, but that is not the case with Fifty Shades of Grey. I read half of the book and decided that was enough. Occasionally, my boyfriend would read over my shoulder and walk away chuckling saying \\"I've read better smut on the internet.\\" And it's true. The plot is predictable and the characters are extremely under developed.<br /><br />Now, I don't claim to be an expert in writing or storytelling, but what I do know is that this book shouldn't have such a high rating. If you are looking for a book that is a quick read and doesn't require any kind of thought whatsoever, you'd be pleased with Fifty Shades of Grey. If you are looking for a book that has substance and that is written well, don't purchase this book.

B008ASLNN2|1.0|Unfortunately, Amazon does NOT allow PC users to stream movies in HD: WTF? How can this be? To top it off, I cannot cancel and change my order to the standard resolution version, I'm apparently left to either a) suck it up and savor the flavor of getting effed out of $5 or b) buy a roku, xbox or ps3 to watch the apparently non-refundable video on. Pathetic, Amazon.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Just finished the book about 5 minutes ago. It is, undoubtedly, one of the best books I have read in a long time. Haven't quite felt this way since I was a kid putting one of the Harry Potter books down.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and spend a buck and a half on this book. Just be weary: you might not be able to stop reading. And even after you're done you'll be hungering for the next book.<br /><br />EDIT: I should talk a little bit about the flaws of the book. The only problem I had with it aside from the grammatical errors (which altogether did not bother me much) was that it was very dark. Now, before anyone criticizes me for saying such a thing, I will note that I did not factor this into my score of the book. It is clearly a five-star work. Nevertheless, I walked away from it feeling very drained and bitter. It has a very skeptical and existential feel to it, qualities that I strongly dislike but will refrain from criticizing.
B003Y5H57E|5.0|Slow beginning but it wraps it up the second time so well. It hits all the right notes while still using the stereotypes in unexpected ways.

0545265355|5.0|Well written and interesting concept. The story kept rolling along keeping wanting to go to the next page.  The author gave a vivid visual as the event unfolded.
0393327345|5.0|Okay so I know I'm waaaaaay behind on this review, i just finished reading the book, and WOW. I had seen the movie and thought it was incredibly smart and intense. I never realized there was a book until a couple of years ago. i was finally able to find the book at a used book store, I read the book and hoped it wouldn't ruin the movie for me but readin it it really goes hand in hand with each other. the book is dark and intense and really smart for its time. the characters were easily relateable to a certain degree. the narrator went well with Tyler Durden though they were practically polar opposites to each other, it was easy to understand the narrators connection with Tyler to be more out there, and the fear of later knowing what was really going on. I highly recommend this book if you understand the genius behind it for Mr. Palahnuick, I congratulate from turning a 7 page short story into the incredible novel it was meant to be.<br /><br />IN TYLER WE TRUST...

Watched it twice and still found it to be very trite with a story line whose conclusion was obvious from about 30 minutes into the film. I know I'm in the minority but, in my humble opinion, the movie was only worth one star. Save your money.

0553386816|3.0|Please note the title of this book is Ford County Stories....that tells you it's a collection of things. It's not a typical Grisham cohesive novel from beginning to end. Instead there seems to be a main thread that carries on for most of the book, then it starts diverging off in other directions. At first I just thought this was part of the historical Grisham pattern - and the stories would merge together in the future. It's not.<br /><br />Instead this is a collection of writing - though not distinctly separated out. And none of them actually come to resolve.<br /><br />It is certainly weird, almost like he got started on a number of things - needed to fill some contractual obligation and published. If this was not a bestselling author, the book never would have made it to publication. But, powerful people can get away with stuff as we all know.<br /><br />I purchased it expecting a Grisham novel, one to grab and maintain my attention, divert me from day-to-day life and take me to a place of justice that always provides the fantasy that things actually will work out in the end. This is not that, the stories leave you hanging. But, they are written well, and they will keep your attention. It offers diversion (which we seem so willing to pay for), but it does not offer full illusion or resolution. That said, it comes up short. I'd say get another Grisham book, skip this one.<br /><br />But, like me, if you've already read all the others...well, it's a short diversion for you.
B007H1HQW0|1.0|Quick shipping and it does the job. Not to happy with the order at all though. It was all beat up and looked like it had been used quite a bit.  If I wanted a used one I could've saved money and bought a used one. Instead I ordered this thinking it was new and got pretty much ripped off. Bad part is, I needed it right away so couldn't send it back. Thanks for wasting my money. Hoping the blades will last through the job but they are so little I can't see if they were used.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|(I don't think) that this book is as good as the first book or as good as the third book. It seems that the sex scenes are just repeats of the same details over and over. Don't get me wrong--I am addicted to this love story and the characters in the story. I wish I could meet a Christian Grey--the one who exists after Ana \\"happens\\" to him, of course. But there needs to be story, adventure, mystery etc., BESIDES the kinky sex. Even steamy sex can get boring if you're only reading about it ;-/ You could almost skip the second book and not miss much of the story. Only my opinion !!
B005LAIIRQ|2.0|Wolves should sue this production for defamation of character. They look unreal and ridiculous here for no good reason. Even if you take the wolves and their attacks to be mythic, serving as metaphors for the approach of death that we all face - their presence in this film still doesn't work. More compelling, genuine metaphors could have been found for mortality.<br /><br />Although I was somewhat prepared for this film to fail in concept, I thought it might at least give me a chance to see some real wolves close-up, to look into their intense, intelligent eyes. But this movie affords no such opportunity for nature study. Don't think you'll see much of any actual wolves here. In most instances, the film substitutes improbable, Claymation-like mock-ups for real wolves in what few murky close-ups you do get. Godzilla looked like a more realistic, less laughable lizard than these animals look like representatives of their species.<br /><br />Then I thought well, at least I might get a few survival tips from this film. Wrong again. Neeson's character makes the absurd decision to lead the other plane crash survivors away from the relative safety of the plane wreckage - across a vast expanse of snow - into the woods. All right, once having negotiated past this exposure, I thought the men could survive any subsequent wolf attacks by simply climbing a tree. However metaphoric these wolves, they surely couldn't be shown climbing trees in pursuit of their prey. But no one here thinks to climb a tree. Instead, Neeson leads his remaining men on to swing over a chasm. Why?<br /><br />Finally I thought, well, this film might still be salvageable if developed as a revenge-on-humanity tale along the lines of \\"The Birds.\\" This film starts with that potential when we early see Neeson's character, hired to kill any predators that might threaten the drilling operation in Alaska, shooting a wolf and presiding over its somewhat lingering death. I thought any subsequent wolf attacks mightbe framed as payback for the callous caging and killing we inflict on other species. But no, the movie doesn't take advantage of that potential springboard into a plotline.<br /><br />There are a few almost touching moments in the last quarter of the film, as the men drop their continuous, pointless cursing at each other and become more sympathetic in their reflections on death. However, these moments aren't nearly enough to rescue any of these antagonists, or this film, from becoming simply a nonsensical, gory mess.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I can`t believe that this infantile, dreadfully written book has even made it to a publisher! A sign of the decline of the American civilization for sure; what happened to the great American authors of the 20th century?<br />I guess the puratinical Americans think it`s sexy:pathetic.<br />A waste of money and time.

B0059XTUB8|4.0|When I first read that Michelle Williams was going to play Marilyn Monroe in the film adaptation of Colin Clark's story of an encounter with the legendary star, I was taken aback, as I doubted Ms Williams could carry it off. Was I wrong! Although there is little physical similarity to Marilyn Monroe, Ms Williams gives us a performance that captures the charm and the insecurities of the film icon. In addition, we are treated to her delightful interpretations of Marilyn singing \\"Heatwave\\" and \\"That Old Black Magic.\\"<br /><br />The movie is based Clark's story of the filming of \\"The Prince and the Showgirl\\" In London. Kenneth Branagh gives an entertaining performance as Sir Laurence Olivier, driven more than slightly batty by Marilyn's lateness, her insecurity about her ability as an actress (reinforced by Olivier shouting at her just to be sexy, as wasn't that what she did), and her neediness just a few weeks into her marriage to playwrite Arthur Miller. Clark, played by Eddie Redmayne, is the third assistant director who befriends Marilyn and with whom he has a friendship even though he must defy the powers that be in order to do so.<br /><br />Redmayne is perfect as the young (23 year old) aspiring director, whose prominent and intellectually oriented family seems to find his ambitions childish. His infatuation with Marilyn is obvious to all, even though he insists it is primarily professional. Dominic Cooper and Julia Ormand are mostly wasted as Arthur Miller and Vivian Leigh, while Dame Judi Dench gives her usual entertaining performance in a minor role. Emma Watson plays Redmanyne's love interest among the production staff, a relationship that seems doomed from the start due to the English class differences between their respective families. For those of us who love books about movies and movies about movies this is just about perfect. Ms Williams playing the actress being herself with Colin but then \\"becoming Marilyn\\" when a group of university students appear suddenly was absolutely brilliant. She certainly deserved her Academy Award nomination as Best Actress for this performance. Altogether an enjoyable, entertaining, and thought-provoking film.uddenly was absolutely brilliant. She certainly deserved her Academy Award nomination as Best Actress for this performance. Altogether an enjoyable, entertaining, and thought-provoking film.

B001NFNFNU|5.0|Do you believe everything they tell you? The Changeling is a bizarre film about a young boy that mysteriously disappears. When the boy is found he has curiously changed into a totally different person.  This, of course, does not sit well with the boy's mother. The police attempt to convince the mother (Angelina Jolie) that the boy is indeed her son. The mother sets out on a life mission to prove this child is not her son. The Los Angeles Police Department insist this boy is her son and declare her crazy. They send her to a psycho ward and the movie gets real One Flew Over the Cuckoo Nestish.  The psycho ward is some kind of toxic shock day care secretly run by the LAPD.  They try to brainwash her into insanity but she will not break. Changeling is the story of a woman's unbreakable dedication to uncover the evil ways of the police department and put a horrifying murder case to rest. The dramatized incident was connected to the \\"Wineville Chicken Coop\\" kidnapping and murder case. Changeling explores many different issues such as corruption, discrimination, and the effects of violence on community.  The story is set in 1928 but the issues are timeless and relevant today. This is a great historical film directed with style and class by Clint Eastwood.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|awesome game the way that you can have Other people with you I just i knew that I liked it
B007J4T2G8|1.0|i will not go into a lenghty description about this book but i will say that i found it comical but not in a good way. this does not deserve to be called erotic and if thats what you are wanting you will not find it with this trilogy. thats just my opinon. not bestseller material.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Prometheus is not an action movie, not a horror movie, it is very much a contemplative movie, there is action and horror yes, but those were not the points.  I loved this movie, and have very little I can say about it that is not positive.  I will say this, Guy Peirce (sp) was miss used in this.  I think that is my only complaint really, this is a great movie.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|Fun, challenging, and with lovely graphics. A good deal for less than a dollar. The interface takes some brief adjusting to but is fairly seamless once you get used to it.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Extremely erotic, heartfelt and heartbreaking. This book was a fantastic read. It made me think in ways i didnt think was possible. When you think you couldn't possibly read another word, the story plays on your mind and you have to read on!

0099579936|1.0|So I purchased this book because multiple friends had recommended it. I certainly don't consider myself a feminist however I truly don't understand how so many woman could love, enjoy and find this book erotic. It is basically about a young woman who has not found herself emotionally, has never had sex and is just graduating from college looking for an internship. She meets this guy who in my opinion, mentally, physically, and sexually abuses her. How is this entertaining?? I suppose it would be one thing if she was older and more experienced but she is not. I am truly sad for this girl who has every second of her life managed to what and how much she eats, what she wears, what doctor she sees and to what type of birth control she uses decided by a man.. WTF.. We have come to far as woman to find this entertaining. I will throw this book away because I would be embarrassed if someone saw it on my self or my self daughter read it thinking it was something she should read or find acceptable in her young life.<br /><br />Oh and did I mention all the hitting, spanking, and whipping ...

B0086700CM|5.0|I can't stop playing it. Be careful very addictive! Can't wait for Temple Run 2. As you advance in the game, the game gets a little faster and its hard to make turns or keep from falling off the edges. Still worth the download.

B004LROMX4|2.0|The title of my review is something Tom Mason (Noah Wyle) said in Season 1, and I think it sums up how I (and maybe the rest of the audience) was feeling while watching this show because it sure moved slowly.  Like others have said, I thought I would like this show because it's about an alien invasion and it's got Spielberg attached to it, so I gambled and bought it even though the only footage I had seen were promos for Season 2 on TNT.  Sadly, I was wrong.<br /><br />Wyle's performance was the best thing about this series, and if it weren't for him I probably wouldn't have made it through all 10 episodes.  Some of the other actors did a good job, but I hated Will Patton's acting nearly every time he was on screen.  His character, Weaver, was annoying as well because he almost always disagreed with whomever he was talking to, especially Tom, so conversations with him became predictable.  It was hard to take him seriously with that pony tail: he acted all military but yet had a hairstyle that normally wouldn't be allowed in the armed forces.  Some of the kids' acting was ok, but others made me groan they were so bad.  Pope is the show's answer to Sawyer, the shaggy-haired rebel on \\"Lost\\" who acted too cool to hang with the others and did his own thing.  That much they have in common.  However, Pope lacks Sawyer's charisma and charm and comes off looking and sounding like Dennis Miller, who thinks he's funny but isn't.  FS writers: why don't you make him a bad ass instead of a failed wise ass? I might like him then.<br /><br />As others have pointed out, this show is more of a family drama than it is a sci-fi series, which I wasn't expecting.  I could do without all the hugging, movitivational pep talks and feel-goood moments.  In one scene, the 2nd Mass takes a break from war to watch a movie in the gym of the school they've made their hidden base.  Ok, but the movie they're showing is a cartoon--not a well-respected animated feature film like most of Pixar's filmsbut a children's cartoon--and everyone in the audience is laughing hard.  Really? I understood what the writers were trying to do, but did they truly expect us to believe that even the adults found that cartoon hysterically funny? Fail.  And would Weaver really have wasted the gasoline needed to run the generator that powers the projector just so people could blow off a little steam? That's hard to believe unless they had access to an endless supply of gas, but I didn't think that was the case since we saw the 2nd Mass searching for gas in abandoned vehicles.<br /><br />I was hoping a show about people fighting back against an alien invasion would have lots of fighting, but there was little action in each episode, and the season-long build up to the resistance fighters' attack was a big let down.  I was hoping we'd finally be treated to a huge battle, a feast for the eyes heavy on visual effects, but that wasn't the case.  As far as effects go, some worked but others didn't: the tiptoeing mechs (which were obvious rip offs of the two-legged AT-ST walkers from \\"Return of the Jedi\\") didn't always look like they occupied the same space as the background they were drawn over.  And what's with that moaning sound they make? Is it meant to be scary? Sorry, it's just silly.<br /><br />TNT has been hyping the hell of out the 2-hour Season 2 premiere, which airs tonight.  I will probably watch it out of curiousity, hoping this year the show will focus more on action, effects and the mythology of the alien visitors.  In the meatime, I'll be selling my copy of Season 1.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It's hard for me to believe that so many people find fault with this book; I absolutely loved it! I fell in love with Christian immediately, and let me tell you...my marriage had benefitted greatly. I highly recommend this entire series, its been an eye opening experience for me.
B0077SGMXM|3.0|I didn't bother downloading; I really don't like this new trend towards in-app purchasing. I realize that you can block that capability by changing the configuration, and I might not take such an exception if the default was opt-out rather than opt-in. But if the developers aren't making enough, they just need to set the purchase price appropriately and then let the customers determine if the game is really that good.<br /><br />Edit: I emailed the developer and after a very quick and courteous response I looked further into in-app purchasing; I was under the assumption that you had to do this for each app that had this capability, but it's actually just one setting in the Amazon Store.  So, it's not as bad as I had first thought; I downloaded the game, disabled the Amazon settings and verified that I couldn't purchase anything in-app, so I bumped my rating up by one star.<br /><br />I still don't care for this whole in-app purchasing system, so I couldn't give it a higher rating than I did, but the developer made it seem like this system is here to stay - apparently it's harder to make a profit on Android than on iOS.  I still don't fully understand the difference between the Amazon paid version and the Google free version, but according to the developer the Google free version may be ad-supported (at some point in the future if it isn't already) whereas the Amazon paid version won't be.
0099579936|2.0|I've been hearing about this book and was wanting a good read this summer....if you are over 16, don't bother picking it up. Thank heavens a co-worker loaned me the book to read, because I would have been pissed to have spent any money on it.

B0086QS7N2|5.0|I remember being 13 years old, unwrapping my \\"Moving Pictures\\" cassette and putting it into my Walkman.  Track 4 Anarchist immediately returned me to the early 80's.<br /><br />These guys are in their early 60's and belting out some of their best bass and drum driven material ever.<br /><br />Geddy's vocals on track 5 Carnies, not quite the shrill \\"Caress of Steel\\" stuff, it is a throwback from his vocals past.<br /><br />Headlong Flight, Anarchist, Caravan, and possibly BU2B would have all been in heavy rotation on AOR radio.<br /><br />Yeah, Headlong Flight is a \\"rip-off\\" of Bastille Day; Totally re-hashed it and made it a lot of fun. Great track.<br /><br />Great Disc, strongly reccomend it for all who haven't indulged in Rush since Presto, Counterparts, etc.  Can't wait to see Rush on the road this Fall!

B00729GQ0A|4.0|What would you do when someone dies in front of you and you've been accused of murdering him?<br />What do you do when you hear voices in your head? Do you shut them out or do you listen to them?<br />How about when you discover that your love interest who looks nineteen is actually several centuries old?<br /><br />These are just some of the questions that Sophia Parsons had to deal with. Aside from having a mother who joined a church led by a fanatic, Sophia had to suck it up with Mrs. Franklin who wished to get her out of her own house because she believed Sophia is a witch. One night, when her friend Ivory took her to a club, she met Charles. And soon, her world turned upside down.<br /><br />The Cruor, Strigoi, Ankou, Chibold - these are the creatures of the supernatural world. Sophia didn't believe in supernaturals. Little did she know that she belonged with them. When she finally discovered the truth about her and her ancestors, she used her power to protect the ones she love.<br /><br />Thanks to my friend's urging and suggestion, I was able to buy \\"The Forever Girl\\" through Amazon (with my new Kindle). Admittedly at first, I told myself, \\"another vampire love-story?\\" But then, I have a knack for paranormal tales so I decided to give it a shot. When I read about Sophia being questioned by the police after being accused of hexing a child, I knew I couldn't put this book (or in my case - my Kindle) down.<br /><br />What I dearly love about this book is how Rebecca Hamilton didn't use the common words like \\"vampires and shape-shifters\\" to depict the creatures in Sophia's world. The story was fast-paced and very well narrated. Furthermore, Hamilton competently described her characters, as well as projected their flashbacks (or their pasts) without confusing the reader's train of thoughts. {sometimes, when I read a book, I usually get perplexed when a flashback is suddenly inserted} but with Forever Girl, I got all excited and it only made me want to read more and more, especially with the unexpected twists and turns.<br /><br />Like what I've tweeted before: Sophia + Charles = Forever
B005LAIHR2|5.0|This is a farce and should be viewed as it is. The acting is exaggerated and thet helped make it a great comedy. Many of the scenes were so funny the people in the theater laughed out loud. The singing was great and I have never liked that type of music. In fact, I ordered the audio CD. Catherine Zeta Jones, Alec Baldwin and Russel Brand  are wonderful as comedians. When I left the theater, everyone leaving with me had a smile on their face. I would see it again.
B005TPS0WG|4.0|The episode is great, but the synopsis is misleading. Amy is definitely not a demon. There were no demons in this episode. If you can't spell whatever she is called, just say 'monster'.<br /><br />I started watching the show at Season 7 with what was available on Hulu, and liked it so much that I went back and bought seasons 1-6 here. Now that I'm caught up to Season 7, I'm trying to figure out what episodes I've already seen. The misuse of the term demon threw me off, and thus I paid $2 for an episode I've already watched.
B0062NAX1U|1.0|\\"Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap\\" Gal 6:7<br /><br />I open this review with scripture. Why you ask? WELL EVERY Christian movie ever made is a mockery of God. When Christians make a movie they never think of how to entertain they just try to drill the message in. The Point of Christian films should be to<br />encourage people to live as Christ did. Not Judge others, accept people for who they are while not ignoring their sinful nature.<br /><br />Christian movies seldom give this message and it's made worse by drilling home personal opinions of the ministry behind these movies. Courageous is a fine example of this. The message of this film \\"BE A MAN BY FORCING CHRIST ON TO YOUR KIDS\\" This message is delivered through a melodramatic poorly edited sermon near the end of the film. It's less a Christian Sermon and looks more like when Hitler gave his speeches in Nazi Germany.<br /><br />Christians, some the mildness sheep with blind faith, Will love this others will see this as what it is. A Poor attempt to make a GOOD Christian movie.<br /><br />We have separation of Church and state...we also apparently have a separation of Church and entertainment.

It's not an actual digital copy; it's access to their servers to watch while online...so, no watching when not connected - which, for most people, defeats the purpose of having a digital copy in the first place!<br /><br />It's frustrating because this movie is, on its own, excellent. But they need to stop this nonsense of ripping off their customers and advertising it as a \\"digital copy\\" when it's not.<br /><br />The movie gets 5 stars - the ultraviolet garbage gets zero.

014241543X|4.0|This book was very good. I started it and finished it within a matter of hours. It is definitely a page turner, and once you start reading, you won't want to put it down until you're finished. I experienced many emotions while reading this book, I laughed, got angry, cried, and then cried some more. This book is now one of my favorites; I just wish that I could have gotten more from the ending. I wanted more, I wanted to find out what would happen next. I guess this is what makes it a good book, when you finish you become upset that you're done.

I don't like being able to predict an entire book from start to finish. I will definitely be reading pandemonium and seeing how the story continues.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a fun game it is very exiting I wish I could play all day my dad hares wen I'm on it because wen I play it I pay no attention to him and when he is saying something I throw up my hand at him.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I still do not know why some people have rated it so low, but to me it is a great book and I have all intentions of reading it again.  And I hope they dont ruin the movie they are making out of the book.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I was willing to give this book a chance based on the recommendation of a friend.  I read the summary and asked, \\"What's the difference between this book and any other contemporary romance novel?\\"  Her answer was a wink and a lecherous smile.  Wow, was I disappointed!  First off, the story seems to be someone's fantasy put to print.  I don't begrudge anyone their fantasies, and more power to them for getting it published, but really?  I feel justifiably upset with the publishers for pricing these books too much for this sophomoric writing level. The only positive thing about the book, in my opinion, is that the main character has the hair color I prefer in a leading man.  And in my fantasies, he would be as rich and philanthropic as Christian Grey. I didn't even find the hyped-up scenes hot because the character development was so forced that it didn't convey any emotion or passion that would make a great sex/love scene gratifying.  It did remind me of a dingy sorority girl reliving step by step details of her sexcapades to her girlfriends.  And why drag it out to three books??  Oh I see....for the publishers to stick it to us again!!!  The story is not even strong enough to stretch out to three books and the whole series is not worth $30!!  It's ridiculous.  All the hype around the book was so overblown and undeserved.<br /><br />If you want really good contemporary romance novels I would highly recommend Susan Elizabeth Phillips instead.  She knows how to WRITE and develop characters one would actually care about. After reading her books, a reader would feel very satisfied and eager to read all of her works.<br /><br />Now I'm so mad at the publishers for pricing these E.L. James books a ridiculous amount, and I'm even more mad at myself for buying into the publicity.  I just feel like a sucker for for getting sucked into the Hype of Fifty Shades.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|OMG this is a blast! Now if only I could use these tools on the real course!!! It takes a few shots to get it but then lookout-i had to turn it off or we would not be having dinner tonight'
B007ZXK08C|1.0|Having read Dark Places, I was really looking forward to Gone Girl Gone. What can I say...I hated it. This novel represents everything I loathe in the crime genre - increasingly unbelievable plot turns, unforgivably cliched characters (Tanner Bolt, really??), unlikely motivations and actions, a heavy reliance on convenient coincidence...need I go on? This is a far less accomplished piece of writing than Dark Places and I cannot recommend it. There is nothing new, clever or compelling here, fellow readers. One star, at best.
B007MDB71O|4.0|Strong visuals, stylish direction and effective acting. I certainly wouldn't take anyone to task for not liking this film but for me this was a great example of pulp sci-fantasy. I would like to see a sequel but I don't think that is too likely.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I have now read and re-read this book several times. Each time, I get more out of it. Duhigg's examples from the Iraq war to Starbucks make the concepts very compelling. I have recommended it to our reading group  and they loved it too. The concepts apply to me personally and professionally so this is one I'll be referring back to in years to come.
B005EGXTL2|4.0|Wow yet another sleepless night started at around 2am as I couldn't sleep and finished it around 9.30am I simply couldn't put this book down.<br />This last book in the trilogy and starts off from the end of Catching Fire and we see Katniss and her colleagues becoming rebels against the city, she is made the Mockingjay to the people to give them hope that their cruel lives will change. I loved how she was more involved in the rebellion rather than being just told what to do. I also love the first person storyline so we know what Katniss is seeing and feeling throughout the whole trilogy.<br /><br />Spoiler alert!!!!!!<br />I feel some reviewers were a little harsh as all 3 books were brilliant for me it was just the ending that I felt was rushed and I lost my connection with Katniss and Peeter. I feel Peeter should have played more of a role in this final story, maybe rescued sooner, as it was both Katniss and him that drove me quickly through the first 2 books, he was the good at keeping Katniss together, he was the strength and support she needed even though she didn't realise it herself.<br />Katniss really sacrificed herself in both mind and body for her country. I wanted to know more of what happened to the Capitol; afterall the whole trilogy has been about Snow and his cruelty. For me Snow's death was too quick after all the atrocities he has done and the cruelties he administered to her friends. I would have loved a more dramatic ending for him, maybe a dramatic finale between them both; which I was expecting and a little disappointed not to get.<br />I wanted to see the changes within the city in the aftermath of all this; I felt Katniss would have had a full hand in how it was being run, that she would be more determined in keeping people safe. Afterall it is just her and her Mother from now on; so I was surprised that Suzanne chose her to fall apart so badly but I understand as how do you get on with life after such heartbreak and tragedy; maybe this was more natural an ending?<br /><br />I was also on Gales band wagon and I would have loved to see more of Gale in the ending as he had such a huge part within her family and saved them many times. But for me I really wanted a huge reunion between Katniss and Peeter where she finally realised she did love him and really wanted and needed him and him her. I feel through all this tragedy it should have brought them closer as they understand each other; but I didn't feel the closure between these two. I would have liked to see how they both coped and gradually healed; not ok well were having 2 kids now, it was too an abrupt end to 3 amazing books.<br /><br />Despite all this it was a fast paced exciting and well written read with many horrific surprises and twists. I still thoroughly enjoyed these 3 books and disappointed it is all finally over. I really hope Suzanne Collins writes another book in this style and storyline I really loved each book in its own way.ore natural an ending?<br /><br />I was also on Gales band wagon and I would have loved to see more of Gale in the ending as he had such a huge part within her family and saved them many times.

B005CKPQNE|5.0|My husband doesn't quite get why I love this series so much. I discovered the past seasons on Netflix and then had to buy Season 4 to get my BB fix. I can't wait for the next season to start in a couple of weeks.<br /><br />Walter White's character is shocking and compelling. You can't imagine becoming a ruthless meth dealer but he slowly brings you into his competing madness of being too proud and having no shame. Pinkman's character is equally compelling with a clear need for fatherly approval and a desire to gain some respect from his high school chemistry teacher. The complex characters make this story line interesting and raises the question for all of us of \\"how far would you be willing to go?\\" The answer is a slippery slope!
B0077SGMXM|1.0|This app is free on the Google play store. Why are they charging $3 for the same applies? I thought the free app of the day was supposed to be an actual app that costs money not one where the makers just put a ridicules price tag on it just so it can be featured as the free app of the day.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Fun! My kids and I are addicted! As far as free apps go, you cannot really complain about the ads.
B0086700CM|5.0|I cant stop playing this game. Its so addicting. I suggest you download it because its free. Get addicted today.
B000GFLKEY|5.0|Great movie with a load of interesting and very amusings extras. There was a lot of stuff shot by Spike Lee , who is not my avorite director, which he did no include in the final product. The interviews of the victims were great and the choices he and the editor made kept the cracking pace of this movie alive. If you are in to scammmy twisty heist movies this is among the best in my opinion.The casting was perfect and the story was fun and intense. Nice work on the score as well if you are also a film music buff.
B003R0MF5I|4.0|Chuck Bartowski embarks on a personal mission to track down his missing mother, aided by John Casey and Sarah Walker. However, they soon discover that Chuck's mother may have ties to Volkoff Industries, an international arms-dealing organisation based in Moscow and now their their #1 target. Complications ensue as Chuck and Sarah get engaged, Ellie and Devon have a baby and an old computer resurfaces which may hold the key to an old mystery...<br /><br />Chuck's fourth and penultimate season is a bit of a mixed bag. It's as reliably watchable as ever but a feeling of staleness is never too far away. Chuck's search for his mum feels a little derivative of his earlier search for his father. The producers try to make the two storylines more individual by painting the characters very differently and approaching the plots in different ways (we meet Chuck's mother very early on and see how she reacts to Chuck's attempts to find her), but there is the feeling that we have been here before. Linda Hamilton's casting as Chuck's mother may also be a geek-friendly nod to the audience (and an excuse for a few Terminator gags), but unfortunately Hamilton gives a stiff and somewhat unconvincing performance that doesn't help the problem.<br /><br />Much more successful is Timothy Dalton, channelling pure scenery-chewing villainy in his role as Volkoff, an evil arms-dealer with a surprisingly sentimental side (a sequence where he plays charades is particularly demented). His appearances are highlights of the season.<br /><br />Where the story goes awry is in the show's descent into predictable cliche. Sarah and Chuck have been together for more than five minutes, so clearly they now have to talk about getting married, with all the attendant, predictable storylines that brings along with it. The actors do their best with the material, but it feels like Chuck-the-espionage-comedy-drama is losing ground to Chuck-the-soap-opera, which is a fundamentally less interesting show. This isn'thelped by the emphasis moving more away from the Buy More, with less screen time for Jeff and Lester's crazy antics or Big Mike's curiously entertaining Subway obsession. Isaiah Mustafa (aka 'the Old Spice advert guy') appears a recurring employee at the Buy More which sets up an amusing storyline, but again it fails to fulfil its potential and he soon disappears.<br /><br />Still, the show remains enjoyable on an episode-by-episode basis. At 24 episodes, it's the longest season of the entire series and this would risk the storyline becoming overstretched, but the writers break it into two half-seasons to better handle things. The first half revolves around the battle against Volkoff and the search for Chuck's mum, whilst the second sees a return to more stand-alone storylines before a new story arc involving Volkoff's daughter (an under-written Lauren Cohan) kicks off. This arc, in which Chuck inadvertently turns Volkoff's daughter from an ally into an enemy, is potentially fascinating but falls apart due to some clunky writing and contrived events.<br /><br />The fourth season of Chuck (***½) has many individually entertaining episodes and moments, and the regular cast remains as watchable as ever, but there is a feeling of tiredness creeping into affairs. However, the show is rejuvenated by a shake-up in the final episode that could make the fifth and final season more interesting. The season is available in the UK (DVD) and USA (DVD, Blu-Ray) now.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book goes no where! It was one of the most pointless books I have ever read. It was painfully uneventful and the same thing happened over and over and over again (sex). Just as something was about to be interesting (like Grey disappearing), the author would resolve it in a few pages. Stupid. It pains me that this is so popular!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I thought Book 1 was really good but this was not as good as most sequels aren't. It's still interesting to read but some parts I found a bit ridiculous.

B004MC8CA2|4.0|Although this is a good App for the Bible, I found another that I preferred because I had used their software before. So, at this time, I am not using this particular one.
B005GFPZYK|2.0|First and foremost, the author deserves our debt of gratitude for his service to the country.<br /><br />The book /s meandering and the people who should really be ashamed are the writers who supported him on the book.  A quick summary:  SEALs are bad assess.  They like to fight.  He's from Texas. He wishes he would have killed more.  He likes to get in bar fights.  There you go.  No need to read the book.<br /><br />Since he had help writing the book I would have thought there would have been a bit more development of the story.
B0064T6LV8|3.0|Although I have used this App only a couple of times, it brings back memories of the real thing.  The only difficulty I had was getting the spring to pull back so that I could send the little ball into the playing field.<br /><br />Personally, I would prefer to use the computer with some old software I have that requires several keys rather than my stubby fingers.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|I read other reviews stating that this game is free on the Google Play Store, so I decided to check it out.  I thought this was going to be one of those \\"free ads version vs. pay ad-free version\\" things that confuse so many people.  However, this is not the case.  The version on Google Play Store is free and without the ads, except for one \\"try one of our other games\\" splash screen that pops-up at startup--if that's what makes it free, then wow--that's one expensive splash screen.<br /><br />Another difference I noticed with the Google Play Store 2.0 version of this game is that it has OpenFeint.  I only bring this up as information of possible things to come--I'm not saying that the later version (2.0) of this app will have OpenFeint when it gets here to the Amazon Appstore updating this 1.8 version.  One thing though--if Openfeint is in the future for this app at least it's disabled by default.  You have the choice and have to hit the OpenFeint icon to activate it.  But again, since this appears to be in a later version (not yet at Amazon) there is no need to deal with this issue at this time.<br /><br />There are three course levels (Beginners, Intermediate, Advanced)--I tried a little of each and found them all pretty fun.  They all have different themes and you unlock the next new course (and theme) as you complete the previous course.<br /><br />As in all golf games, there are hazards that add strokes to your score, but there are also anti-hazards scattered around that remove strokes as well (of course, these are harder to get)--it's an interesting twist.<br /><br />There are \\"powerups\\" (7 special types of balls) you can use to help make a tough course easier.  You can play up to 7 powerups per round.  You unlock these powerup balls by accomplishing certain tasks while playing/completeing the courses.  If you use up your powerups during a round, you can get more by using your \\"Golf Bux\\".  However, if you use \\"Golf Bux\\" to get additional powerups, but don't usethem, they will not roll over to the next round.  So, if you are going to get them, make sure to use them.<br /><br />You earn \\"Golf Bux\\" by completing achievements (different achievements earn you different amounts).  If you are too impatient to go the achievements route, you can purchase more \\"Golf Bux\\" using real money.<br /><br />The in-app purchase cost for \\"Golf Bux\\":<br />50  @$1.49<br />150  @$3.99<br />500  @$7.99<br />1500 @$14.99<br />5000 @$39.99<br /><br />The Google Play Store version lets you also get more \\"Golf Bux\\" by downloading some of the developer's other apps.  Maybe this is another difference between the free vs pay or the version 2.0 vs 1.8 things.<br /><br />The graphics may be simple, but do have a 3D quality to them.  They are bright and crisp and run smooth--didn't see any lag.  You can zoom-in and zoom-out on the courses.<br /><br />The controls work well.  One for each driving direction (right and left), which lets you adjust the height of the ball flight.  The \\"Go\\" (hit-the-ball) button is in a power meter style--press to start, press again when it reaches the power level you want.<br /><br />There is a help section which does explain things pretty well, along with tips the app gives along the way.<br /><br />All and all, this is a pretty fun game.  If you like golf apps you will probably love this one.  And if golf isn't your first choice, you would still enjoy playing it.<br /><br />I was going to knock off 1 star for the Google Play Store vs. Amazon Appstore confusion, but decided that wouldn't be fair to the app--even though odd (and questionable) it does not effect the way the game runs or plays.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|This is written in poetry text and it's story is about facing up to fearful things...so cute and with a twist at the end to make a child giggle and want to reread it.  There is a repetitive line that my grandkids enjoy helping \\" read,\\" as we go through the story.  My grandkids, 4, 5 and 6 all love it.  I just bought them the follow up story, The Garufalo's Child, but haven't given it to them yet.  It follows the same format, with a similar repetitive refrain...i have no doubt that they will thoroughly enjoy that one, too!
B005LAIH4A|1.0|Boring and propaganda filled.  A truly awful movie.  A really bad attempt to curry favor with radical environmental groups.  Nothing interesting or fun about this movie.  As my grand children said: \\"this movie is sad.\\"

0345803507|2.0|I wanted to like this trilogy and found myself very intrigued by the first volume in the series. However, I felt it should have ended there. The character of Ana becomes so spineless and easily dissuaded from her anger of Christian's actions, that it made me sick. She was far too young and naive to be married. If a friend came to you and told you this was her story, you would tell her how unhealthy the relationship is and to get out. Christian's control of her every action is a symptom of abuse. I found myself rolling my eyes at the rapid pace of the ridiculous story lines (and fights Ana and Christian had that ended so quickly) added to fill pages. I would love to see the first installment as a film, but if they made the subsequent books into movies, I wouldn't go. They are way too sappy. I wanted the story to keep an edge, and it fell flat. This was a relationship that should have run its course after the education of Ana was complete. Christian was intoxicating in Fifty Shades of Grey, but this last book was just a hangover for me.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|The app works fine given the memory constraints on Kindle Fire. Don't expect all of the features as a desktop MS Office suite version.  Especially for the price. However, it seemed rediculous that it immediately wants you to purchase additional basic font sets when it opens.  It would be a complete package when the fonts are included. GOOD app though.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Unbelievable!  Where is all this hype coming from?  Who is getting paid to write favorable reviews.  How can any woman fall for a 27 year old man that is going to beat her to satisfy his sexual fantasies and to completely dominate her life.  Are we going to excuse violence in our search for the perfect man, partner, lover.  I enjoy sex but in real life you don't find a 27 year old handsome billionaire polished and experienced in all aspects of life. More likely to find a rapist or abuser that will make your life miserable. It is not even well written.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|AMAZING!! its a really fun app!!! ya and no matter what other people say get the app!!<br />yeah! and lil ya
B00785P2QC|5.0|the game is fun but hills shouldn't cost money to destroy. that's the only flaw. other then that its a great game
B006LSZECO|4.0|The only reason I didn't give this five stars is that I predicted the outcome, as outrageous as it is, fairly early on. Despite the prediction, I thoroughly enjoyed the ride, enjoyed the fullness of the characters and the frustrating dilemma the situation posed. If you've ever been in a relationship where you weren't totally yourself, where you tried to be the person your partner wanted you to be, then there are parts of this story that may be wickedly familiar, and that's the best part about the read. Makes me want to find other Flynn novels and read away.
0345803485|1.0|After 50 pages I realized that is was just going to be porn without a good story line.  The characters were not believable.  I guess I'm passed the stage of reading for titillation and just wanted a good story.  I'm glad I only paid for the first book and didn't buy all of them.  I wish I could upload the book and get my money back.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl offers so much of what I look for in a book - a compelling plot that makes it impossible to stop reading.  I found myself reading on lunch hours, at red lights, and late into the night.  The end of nearly every chapter left me with a strong compulsion to start the next one.  Just when I thought I knew where the book was heading, it took an unexpected turn, up until the very end!<br /><br />What happens when a wife suddenly goes missing on her fifth anniversary from a once-perfect, but now crumbling marriage.  Of course, the husband is a suspect.  The husband is always a suspect and in this case, the husband is also very suspect (the adjective, as in suspicious).<br /><br />In addition to an edge-of-your-seat plot, the book also offered distinct setting and (mostly) realistic characters.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the book took a hard-to-swallow turn toward the end, but unpredictable to the end, this is a book well worth reading!

B005LAIGSM|4.0|This touching film portrays the true-life tale of true love.<br /><br />Paige and Leo Collins are head over heels in love and recently married when the unthinkable happens.  Paige is injured in a car accident.  When she awakens in the hospital, she mistakes her husband for a doctor.  She has forgotten the recent months of her life, forgetting having met her husband altogether, and even worse, believes she is still engaged to a former fiance.  Paige never does recover her memory so will she recover her marriage?<br /><br />I was worried that the movie version seemed overly dramatized (and I imagine that there is a fair amount of dramatic license), but pictures of the real-life couple (Kim and Krickitt Carpenter) at the end of the movie remind the audience that this truly was inspired by a real love story.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Great book!  Loved the angsty characters and the roller coaster of a story.  Not your typical romance, but fullfilling nonetheless.  By the end you will be anxious to see these two put their fighting behind and get it together.
0345803485|1.0|Where to begin? This will probably be the longest review I'll ever write. I should start by saying this book was given to me as a gift. I'd read all the hype and critique. Given what I knew, quite honestly, I wouldn't have paid for this. But, since I had the book, I decided to approach it with an open mind. I found this book is, in fact, a train wreck. My reasons:<br /><br />First, the British author, who obviously has no sense of American culture, chose to set this story in the U.S. The dialogue is ridiculous. No American college student speaks this way. Not only are many of the phrases and word choices strictly British, but the dialogue is far too formal for college kids.<br /><br />Certain words are repeated ad nauseum. The characters rarely 'say' anything. They 'murmur' to the point of making me want to toss the book through a window. They 'whisper', they 'mutter'. But they don't simply talk.<br /><br />Ana, the main character is beyond naive. She lives on her own and is graduating college, yet has never had a serious boyfriend. She knows absolutely nothing about sex. This, in itself, is difficult to believe. What pushed all this into the absurd was this naive young woman who has, by admission, never met a man she felt attracted to, immediately falls madly in love with the mysterious Christian. She hops right into his bed and his world of BDSM.<br /><br />I didn't find the sex particularly 'hot', as so many reviewers claim. Because Ana felt shame in her role, the sex, to me, came off as demeaning rather than stimulating. She was a possession, rather than an equal partner.<br /><br />Ana, to me, was not at all likable. Her character also made no sense. On the one hand, she is naive, meek, and suffers from low self esteem. On the other hand, she is independent and strong willed. I've never met a person who is all of those things at once.<br /><br />Absolutely everyone falls at Christian's feet. He has the world at his fingertips. Everyone does his bidding. His looks make women weak-kneed. He's dark and mysterious, wealthy, and only has eyes for Ana. Far too stereotypical of the 'bad boy' hero.<br /><br />That being said, of all the characters, Christian is the only one I found interesting. In the last third of the book, we begin to see how he became the man he is. I wish he'd been more developed, and less stereotypical.<br /><br />The only part of this book I enjoyed and cracked a smile at were the emails between Ana and Christian. In these, I found more honesty and personality.<br /><br />I have to ask, where was the editor? The writing here is at beginner level. A good editor could have, and should have, worked to develop this story.<br /><br />In the end, I am at a loss to explain the excited hype and rave reviews for this book. It's a case of damaged bad boy hero meets the younger, naive woman who, unwittingly, wraps him around her finger. There are far more polished books of this nature by talented authors who, for reasons unknown to me, don't get the kind of hype this book has received.ks make women weak-kneed.

There are far more polished books of this nature by talented authors who, for reasons unknown to me, don't get the kind of hype this book has received.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wonderful set of novellas! A dystopian setting which is set in the future (presumably... or possibly on another world, but I get the impression that it's earth), but is not futuristic. Technology level seems about on par with our own, or perhaps 10-50 years ago.<br /><br />The writing is clear, crisp, and Howey does a wonderful job of creating memorable characters that you really feel like you know and love within a short period of time.<br /><br />I really liked how the first three novellas of the series were written from the point of view of different characters. I sort of wish this had continued, but I understood why it didn't as the stories became more complex.<br /><br />The first part of this series is free, but I went ahead and bought the series based on the reviews, and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Also - this series is delightfully free from typos and formatting errors (sometimes an issue in the kindle store...)
B0086700CM|5.0|Ive been waiting for this to come out on the kindle fire, and now that its here I cant stop playing it!! I am hooked, I want to get all of the objectives!
0345803485|5.0|WOW!! MORE than AWESOME!!  MUST READ!! HOT!! You wont be able to put it down!! Great for her AND HIM!!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I used to be a huge Genesis fan, but I switched over to Rush in 1991 because of their musical mastery, especially in terms of lyrics that were not ridiculously inane. My two brothers helped convert me as well. I have seen Rush live 3 times since 2008, once in my hometown! Every song on this CD is absolutely awesome...except maybe \\"BU2B2.\\" DEFINITELY worth the money!
B007JOM7C4|4.0|I was just about to finally get around to buying Katy Perry's Teenage Dream when I received an e-mail from Amazon telling me about The Complete Confection being released.  Therefore, I am not as disappointed as some of the other reviewers here, although I can understand their frustration.  In any case, I love Katy's music, and I caught her live in Vegas last November and she is very entertaining.  While I personally find a couple of the songs on the album annoying; \\"Peacock\\" and \\"ET\\" (they don't really sound like her to me, and feel out of place on this album), the songs that tell a story, like \\"Teenage Dream\\", \\"The One That Got Away\\", and \\"Part of Me\\" are excellent.  I especially love \\"Firework\\".  \\"Last Friday Night\\" and \\"California Gurls\\" are great fun and the rest of the album fits together very well.
B002RHGYOA|5.0|With [[ASIN:0307949508 The Girl Who Played With Fire: Book 2 of the Millennium Trilogy (Vintage Crime/Black Lizard)]]Stieg Larsson has done it again after The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.  He keeps you intrigued with a wide range of characters and events interweaved to form a great crime thriller; albeit a little repetitive if you have recently read his first of the trilogy.  A great read!
B0065Y1WWK|5.0|Jessie J is seriously talented, and there are already so many great reviews here that I just want to add to the positive remarks.  This is definitely a great album for the car!

0345803507|2.0|Well, all the hype and all the \\"do it in bed with the lights out\\" couples are out there ready to spice it up..whoo hoo.<br />This book barely scratches on the surface of BDSM or really what it is all about.  It is not a realistic portrayal of that world, but it is enought for the every day folk.<br />Those of you truly interested in the \\"world of kink\\" will have look elsewhere...as these books wont give you what you need or want.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|This is the best movie of 2012 I have seen! Absolutely great acting, great action, comedy, romance- everyone from<br />kids, women, men and grandparents will love this movie! I recommend it for EVERYONE!
B000001FKY|5.0|I'm a child of the 80's and I remember listening to this band on cassette. They rocked then and still do. When I hear Pour Some Sugar On Me it reminds of friend-exboyfriend. He got me to listen to the band.  Pour Some Sugar On Me was our song. He passed away with panceatic cancer at 25 years old so when I hear the song I remember him.  The rest of songs is so good too. I'm going to get Def Leppards Greatest CD because I love all their songs but I will get this CD specially in honor of my friend whose was one of Def Leppards biggest fans.  If you are a true Def Leppard get this CD along the their Greatest Hits you won't be sorry.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I have always enjoyed jigsaw puzzles.  With this app you can make the puzzles as easy or as challenging as you like. This gives me a chance to do one even when I do not have a lot of time.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This was one of Baldacci's best stories yet.  Very fast-paced and I couldn't put it down.  Lots of action and twists and turns, liked the characters and plot and it was one of those stories that took you fast and held you right straight through to the end.  I love the way he brings a human touch to a hardened loner and assassain. I have read nearly all of his books and this was by far one of my all time favorites.
B0076OV7F0|5.0|This stuff is crazy good.  I love every song and her past stuff.  Lana is a whole planet onto herself.  She'll be around for a long time<br />and she is surrounded by people guaranteeing some great stuff in the future as well.  Best wishes.

B0039NER22|5.0|A feel good ending - Stifler grows up. The American Pie cast keeps it fun and sexy. A fun movie for American Pie devotess.
0345803485|5.0|I had been seeing this book at the top of the bestseller list for so long that I finally decided to take a chance and downloaded the sample onto my kindle. After just two chapters I was hooked and I bought the entire series. This novel is so much more than just \\"erotic romance\\" because their physical relationship is such an integral part of the plot. The story is essentially every teenage girls dreams; a fabulously wealthy man who has never been able to commit to any other woman falls helplessly in love with YOU and can't seem to get enough. What sets it apart from every other novel of this type, of course, is how deeply and disturbingly flawed Christian Grey is. And yet, as you read, you still can't help but fall in love with him yourself. The only interesting bit about this book is that it is set in Seattle with American characters...yet, they have an obviously British speech pattern. Ms James has done well to not use English slang (i.e. no \\"shagging\\" or \\"snogging\\") but the phrasing is still markedly British...but that probably only stands out to a linguist like me. And all in all, it only adds to the uniqueness of the novel. The take away here is that it is definitely worth the read!
B004XZDT60|5.0|This is one of the best CD's I have ever purchased. I enjoy every single song on the CD. He has an amazing voice. I would recommend to anyone to purchase this and I can't wait until his next one comes out.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is a very good tool. after saving my notes like sunday services, i share it on facebook. nice app.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I don't know where those people who give this a bad rating have been. its awesome! its free and its spool much fun get this
B00001ODGR|5.0|I like Styx. They aren't my favorite band of all time but I did grow up with them and like them. But so far in terms of concert DVDs NOTHING comes close to this one. All the hits are here. Renegade. Blue Collar Man. Come Sail Away. Loreli. Lady. Too Much Time on My Hands. Boat on a River. The Best of Times. Foolin Yourself. The Grand Illusion. Tommy Shaw and Dennis De Young are spot on. The pacing is perfect. The video is fantastic. The showmanship is spectacular. NOT the original drummer (he died) but who is going to know? Tommy Shaw and Dennis De Young ARE Styx. It is obvious that I will watch this DVD until it wears out.<br /><br />Edit: Just watched it again... for the Nth time. Never get tired of it. Youtube Grand Illusion followed by Fooling Yourself and Renegade followed by The Best of Times. If you have a problem with any of these versions... then you have a problem with yourself. (And also watch Tommy Shaw in the last minute of Come Sail Away. LOVED IT. ) Every time I watch this DVD I see something new and epic. The energy is amazing. And for me that will ALWAYS be the difference with other video concerts: THE ENERGY of the band AND the audience. Amazing.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I have downloaded and deleted several calculator apps, but this one is s keeper. Easy to use with a nice layout, and it keeps a history of your calculations. I highly recommend this app!
B007Q1VUFA|4.0|Upfront I will admit I have never warmed to the Black Crowes, so it was a bit of a leap of faith for me to give CRB's \\"Big Moon Ritual\\" a chance. At first, I was underwhelmed and even a bit annoyed, but I often find I need to listen to albums several times before I make up my mind about them. I'm glad I gave this one an extra spin or two. For me, the setting can sometimes be the key as to whether I like a recording, and yesterday this one just hit the right vibe. The band likes to unwind its songs and locks into a meandering groove that hovers between meditative exploration and psychedelic torpor. This is music for a summer afternoon or a long drive, the sort of soundtrack that does not ask too much of the listener other than to just relax into the songs.<br /><br />I cannot for sure say which guitar belongs to Chris Robinson or Neal Casal, but there is some good chemistry between the two, and the word \\"fluid\\" just seems the right one to assign to the fretwork here.  Adam MacDougall does not conjure up visions of Rick Wakeman for me (and that is, in my opinion a good thing) but rather more of a hyped, jazzy fearless Leon Russell. Drummer George Sluppick and bassist Mark Dutton keep matters honest and grounded, not just providing the underpinnings for these songs but creating the drive that propels them along their way.<br /><br />I don't see five stars going to this one, but four fireflies on a hazy summer eve fits the bill.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game it is a very good and fun game so I love it.Love it fun game whenever I get bored I play this game to get rid of my boredom
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I am totally addicted to this game! Yes, there are some in-app purchases available, but you can, with patience, achieve the same results without spending any money.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|a lot of fun and I never get bored of it. the good part of it is that the app is free! ! ! ! !
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have been an eclectic reader all my life:  mysteries, historical novels, classics, biographies, memoirs.  Love the printed word. I had read a bit about this book and I was not impressed, but a NY Times top seller?  It must have some redeeming qualities.  Nope, it did not.  It was the most peurile piece of trash I have had the misfortune to run into.  Any of today's myriad of mystery writers can do better sex scenes if that is what the reader is looking for. For S & M devotees, just google the terminology (butt plug, etc.)and you won't have to wade through 500 pages of sheer and total crap.  A trilogy indeed. She had nothing to say in 500 words, but spare me 1500.  I think it is a sad commentary on today's culture that a book of this ilk could make it to a best seller list.  I cannot imagine anyone with functioning brain cells or any reading background at all reading this trilogy.  (It rates NO STARS AT ALL.  I am just sorry trees had to die to make paper for it)
B0018CMJSU|5.0|I never bought \\"The Godfather\\" because I was waiting for it to be restored then I forgot about it for a few years.  I am amazed everytime I watch it.  How could a story shot in three films be so perfect?  If you have never seen this masterpiece you must purchase it soon.  The price is fair.  I am not going to say this is not a violent film because it is and the story could not be told without it.
B0086700CM|5.0|I had heard of this game before but never played it. now its one of my favorites and I can't seem to get enough of it! Definetly addicting.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|\\"You don't understand, this place isn't what we thought it was. I was<br />wrong. We were so wrong. We must leave!\\" When scientists Elizabeth<br />(Rapace) and Charlie (Marshall-Green) discover a pictogram that matches<br />many others found around the world they think they finally have enough<br />evidence of life from other worlds. They along with many others board a<br />ship called \\"Prometheus\\" to venture many light years away from Earth to<br />test their theory. What they find is beyond what they were ready for,<br />and more then they can handle. I have never really been a big fan of<br />the \\"Alien\\" movies but this one looked really good to me. I have to say<br />this was much better then I was expecting. The beginning was<br />interesting and once it got going it was a very tense and a sometimes<br />scary experience. I have to admit that I was totally sucked in to the<br />movie and it made me want to re-watch the other \\"Alien\\" movies to see<br />if this one gave me new found excitement for them. I recommend this to<br />all sci-fi fans and for those that loved the original movies this is a<br />must see. Overall, an extremely entertaining adventure that is well<br />worth your time. The last scene gave me a chill. I loved it. The only<br />complaint I have is that Charlize Theron's character seemed a little<br />unnecessary. This like so many other prequels though fall in to the strange aspect of the technology of movies makes it seem like they had cooler stuff in the beginning of the sagas then in the originals which is set in the future. I give it an A.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I like this game, it's cool. It is an aweful lot like Mario though. It is fun for a free game.
B005LAIGQ4|4.0|\\"In Alaska there are no simple rescues.\\" While filming a story about a kid who can do sno-mobile tricks, reporter Adam (Krasinski) spots a strange sight. When he sends his report of three whales trapped in the ice with only days left to live it becomes national news. Now with the help of his Greenpeace girlfriend Rachel (Barrymore) and a few others the race is on to save the whales. After being totally surprised with how much I liked \\"Dolphin Tale\\" my expectations for this one were pretty high. Once again I was shocked by how much I enjoyed this movie. Almost immediately it sucks you in and holds you through all the highs and lows. This is also another movie that is based on events that happened when I was old enough to remember but I knew nothing about this. Not knowing what happened made the movie seem more tense to me and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. Much like \\"Dolphin Tale\\" this is a great family movie that everyone, not just the kids will love. It is rated PG for language but other then a character saying Hell and bastard I don't remember anything other that that so you won't have to worry about what your kids are hearing. I highly recommend this as a great movie for family night. Overall, one of the best family movies in the last few years. A must see. I give it an A.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a trilogy unlike anything I've read before. I was drawn into the mystique of main character Christian Grey and his unfortunate childhood. Reading about Christian's sexual exploits was a bit shocking at first but the overall story captivated me beyond belief. I couldn't read each book fast enough!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I really enjoyed some of the more recent Reacher novels, so decided to go back to the beginning. Excellent story and well written.
B004QZ9PLU|2.0|I'd like to preface this review by saying I have read every book written by Nicholas Sparks. I like that he is a fellow North Carolinian and the setting for his books is familiar to me. But this book just didn't do it for me this time. My main objection was the constant rotating points of view in which the book was written. In my opinion, this didn't really allow for indepth character development. I liked the ending of the book but that's about it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have never read a book like this before, as romance books are not what I generally like. However some friends of mine had talked me into trying it out and once I started I found it hard to put down. It has a story line that seems totally impossible, but yet it drags you in to want to find out what happens next. I will continue to read the next to books, and I am happy my friends told me to give it a chance.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun challenging games! although wish you could see all games before picking ones to unlock. would recommend app! fun for road trips

B004KNM3HQ|5.0|After listening to Suede's superb Head Music D/E package I was eager for this cd to arrive, prepared for the entire experience I sat quitely at my pc and began to listen. Straight away the sonic differences were apparent.D-M-S is an entirely different kettle of fish to H-M. This collection of songs are dark and brooding, I found it just as enjoyable as H-M though. It is a different band after all, the guitar playing is assured and the song writing is very strong from the two writers all the way through these songs. I enjoyed the dvd as much as the H-M dvd, and the band are always in their true light when playing live, it's obvious their music magic is strong and rock solid.<br />The sound of this cd/album is not as crystal clear as Head Music and that's ok and by the second time through these cds I was totally at ease with those differences. Suede make great rock music period and I for one don't want to have the same cd/album being repeated like some groups do with their work. This is a five star cd/album make no mistake. Recommended.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Gorgeous images and hours relaxed game play. l was never a fan puzzles until I discovered games like this. you can start easy and work your way up or start with a bang. great additional puzzles for free or .99. Loving this game.
030771652X|3.0|I like a story with characters who are developed and thought that this would be a good read.  Also, I like stories about England.  At first I thought this would be a terrific read and a literary read, but was disappointed that it was so maudlin.  Made myself finish reading it and then felt worse at the ending.  Disappointed.
B0086700CM|4.0|I like it a lot, but it gets a lil staticky tugs mostly what ruins my score<br />all in all this game is good
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Amazing series and serious props for self-publishing.  Great setting, characters and story-telling.  Really, really enjoyed reading this... looking forward to reading more from Howey.
B004WGGQPQ|3.0|this app is easy to learn &amp; use however to give it 5stars it would need the ability to alter the width of the drawing pen (the pencil and pens alter the solidness of the line rather than width-- Id prefer the pencil to be 1/10 the width of the pen) and permit drawing geometric shapes.  I could see adding circle square and triangle to the &quot;stickers section&quot; to easily accomplish that.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I was amazed by the amount of detail in this game. It has an interesting story and realistic search expectations: not to mention it actually is pretty accurate to the touch screen for picking out objects. I found it reasonably long and engaging and might replay it, which I can not say for all hidden object games. I do have to admit it felt like something was lacking, not sure what but still really good for less than $2.

1416562605|3.0|Aravand Adiga's debut novel, \\"White Tiger\\" won the Man Booker prize in 2008.  Protagonist Balram, an Indian driver turned murderer and entrepreneur, provides a fascinating social commentary by discussing corruption, caste and socio-economic inequality in the burgeoning country of India.  The novel may have been intended as a satirical exposé of the tragic elements of modern Indian culture, but structurally, the work falls short- the odd letters to the Chinese prime minister, the revelation of the climax so early in the story, and the absence of humanity in the almost unlovable Balram Halwai.<br /> The plot unfolds over seven letters, seven mornings.  It is not exactly clear why Balram chooses to write to Chinese premier Wen Jiabao in advance of his publicized visit to India.  Early on, it is obvious that Balram thinks very highly of himself, almost narcissistic, and that clearly, he has much to say about the \\"century. . .of the yellow and the brown man\\" (Adiga, p. 4).  Under the guise of providing entrepreneurial advice to Jiabao, Balram weaves his story with blunt, simple language; he flits from topic to topic.  The reader, even with little background knowledge of India's current situation, is hopeful that tales of success and overcoming obstacles will emerge throughout the narrative.  After all, Balram is now a successful entrepreneur, one proudly \\"made from half-baked clay\\" (p. 9), as his schooling was never completed.  However, in the end, there is little to learn from Balram's depictions, unless his sole intent was for Jiabao to steer clear from the corrupt, almost dehumanized country.  One must think, was that his goal?  Or, perhaps it was intended as an instruction manual of sorts for the Chinese, that only on the backs of the poor can the country's affluent thrive?<br /> It is apparent very early on in the story that Balram is not only an entrepreneur, but one with a very dark story; born into a life of halwai poverty and restricted by his caste. If that were not enough material for an introductory letter,  Balram outs himself as a murderer; thus emerges the climax of the work.  However, knowing the end state before the \\"why\\" is actually confusing, as there is actually a lot to like about Balram's employer Ashok; he is a gentler, less corrupt man than many of the other men depicted in \\"White Tiger\\".  Adiga puts a lot of effort into the character development of Ashok when compared to some of the other, flatter characters like Pinky Madam.  By the time the murder actually occurs, the reader may well care more for Ashok than Balram.  Truth be told, Balram had been given many opportunities and he appears ungrateful, cunning, and only thinking of himself.<br /> The character Balram is certainly complex-he has many endearing qualities, his hope to persevere being one of the best; however, he takes an unexpected, dark turn, when he discusses his pride in the poster the police had made about him, the one where he is not only suspected of taking a bag filled with money, but in which he also is wanted for the murder of his employer.  Balram has no remorse:<br /> \\"Oh, I could go on and on about myself, sir.  I could gloat that I am not just any murderer, but one who killed his own employer (who is a kind of second father), and also contributed to the probable death of all his family members.  A virtual mass murderer\\" (p. 37).<br />He then follows this with, \\"But I don't want to go on and on about myself\\" (p. 37), but proceeds to do exactly that for the rest of the story.  He is strangely proud of his outcome, which is not at all admirable; he rose up from the Darkness into the Light by way of theft, murder, lies, and the same corruption that he detested as a younger man.  Balram is no success story. A product of the world around him, perhaps, as he is woefully mistreated because of his caste; however, in the end he returns to the ways of those who tormented and oppressed him.  He is a hard character to cheer for, in the end.<br/> While \\"White Tiger\\" had glimmers of greatness, such as the depiction of a land where the richer castes are the \\"men with big bellies\\" and the poorer castes \\"men with small bellies\\",  overall the work was a disappointing, nearly one-sided account of a man who in the end, became nothing to be proud of in any culture.  By mid-point, it was almost predictable and unfunny; by the end, the reader is tired of hearing about a murderer's entrepreneurial prowess peppered with his attempt at conversational comedy.
B007ZD17XO|4.0|I love everything about this game except for one thing: there are instructional texts that show up while waiting for the next game to load; my complaint is they're not onscreen long enough for me to read. They appear to be hints about how to score the most points, etc., but I have yet been able to read one all the way through before they disappear and the game begins. Otherwise, this is a great game.
B007P6VM04|5.0|I love this CD! Every song you can listen to and who's ever listening to this ends up singing all the songs! Great CD def recommend if you liked the series!
B004FRX0MY|4.0|This \\"Amazon MP3\\" app provides a clean and easy interface to access the music files on my HTC EVO 4G or from the Amazon \\"Cloud\\". I use this app every night to play my \\"Brown Noise\\" for sleeping and generally whenever I want to listen music through my phone.<br /><br />Using the app is straight forward, with a simple layout and standard player controls. You can select to display the music in the Cloud, previously downloaded to the device, or access the Amazon \\"Store\\". The app also allows downloading your Cloud stored MP3 files to your device but, as other reviewers have noted, it does not allow you to select where they are stored (i.e. to your SD card). The download location shortcoming is not a significant issue for me since I don't have a lot of music files, but this would be an issue for someone like my daughter who has hundreds of files.<br /><br />The ease of use and access to the Cloud stored files makes this a good choice for my needs.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

0307592731|5.0|I just have to toss in this advice. When you finish the main book and are at the completion of her hike - put the book down for at least an hour or better yet overnight. And only then read the afterword. Let her hike sink in before you read about how her life played out in the following decades. I think you'll feel better about her and the book by not suddenly leaping into future events.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|its a very addicting game loads of fun and simple everyone should be playing this game I wish it was soccer instead
B007J4T2G8|5.0|After initially learning about this series, I didn't think that it would really appeal to me at all.  However, a dear friend strongly suggested it, and so I bought the trilogy at Costco.  I have read the first book and am part way into the second.  I am really enjoying this series.  I agree with many of the reviews that state that the author is repetitive and does not know American culture very well.  However, these are small distractions from the main story.  I am in my 40's and I still thoroughly enjoy this.  I find that I am having a hard time putting the book down, and I am excited to see where things will go for Ana and Christen.<br /><br />Some of the poor reviews have stated that it is not realistic, however, I don't know that I am looking for perfect realism when I read a novel.  I am enjoying this series greatly, and I highly recommend it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun game. great characters from the movie. reminds me of age of empires for kids and the young at heart.

B005S9EJ14|5.0|I won't go into details about the movie, as all probably already know the story about the retirees moving to a hotel found online, and I don't want to spoil the story for anyone who has not seen it.  It was one of the most delightful films I have seen in years. Makes you realize that life is full of surprises, and those surprises do not end until you die.  Loved the characters, played by some of my most favorite actors. I highly recomend this film to all.  This is the first review I have ever written, so I must feel pretty strongly!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book was awful. It took me 2 months to read it because I would put it down out of sheer disgust and only go back to it because I have a problem with starting something and not finishing it. The writing is sub-par, the characters are SO incredibly cliche and the sex scenes are cheesier than the three cheese pizza I am currently munching on. It saddens me that writing of this incredibly amateur nature can make it to Hollywood big screen and remain a best seller for months now. The media has brainwashed people into believing this is a must read and sadly most, including me, have fallen for it. Anyone that does a lot of reading will recognize right away that this book is poorly written. Do yourself a favour and don't spend money on this crap. There are WAY better writers out there within this genre if eroticism is what you want to read about.
B007H9B8FS|5.0|I've been sonically around the block and this should be considered the best album of 2012. Bands today don't rock like Shirley and the Boys. Garbage should capitalize on this brilliance and record their grand opus next.
B0086700CM|5.0|Best game in the whole world ever! It's free and sooo addicting and never freezes up. I've been waiting for a Kindle Fire version and it finally came!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Is very convenient. Love the features.<br />It's would be better if there were more icons to make UI much user friendly
1439127700|5.0|This is a great study on why this country is one of the few who can boast a smoothe transfer of power.  This book should be required reading for anyone who is even thinking of running for president.
B007AJFSJW|5.0|This book is a must read!  It is the best explanation of the current economic difficulties and it's causes that I have ever read.  Dr. Krugman describes the causes of the current economic debacle and explains how we could solve our current economic problems quickly.  His analysis and solutions are written in a way that can be easily understood by those who are not students of economic theory.  Indeed, his explanations and solutions are almost in the vain of \\"common sense\\".  This book is a \\"must read\\" for anyone who wants to understand what is happening in our economic world today!
B001HBYHFA|5.0|Why do the networks always can the great ones?  This was a great movie and a great series.  Good by firefly
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it because it never gets old and you can easily fall off so you really have to be focused. And it is a ball of fun if you know what your doing.
0345803485|5.0|It's absolutely a must read book. It will have your toes curling. You actually visualize a Christian Grey, very sensual.
0345803485|5.0|You must read all 3 books for it all to make sense. First book- sex. Second book- love story. Third- love/ mystery/ it all comes together. I couldn't put it down!
1449408656|5.0|I picked this book up after reading the cat versus human blog for a while.  It has a few classic comics and some new ones, all are hilarious.  I now leave this on my coffee table and it is great for when people come over.  If the book was a little bigger I would be taking out pages and framing them, the content doesn't get old.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|To be a fan of Rush is to appreciate unparalleled musical virtuosity.  \\"Clockwork Angels\\" delivers all of Rush's trademarks.  There's the intricate riffing, the seamless time and tempo changes as well as Peart's acrobatic drumming.  Let us not ignore the deep lyrics, Geddy's bass shredding, atmospheric vocals, and Lifeson's out -of-this-world guitar playing.<br /><br />This is the first concept album they recorded since [[ASIN:B000001ESL Hemispheres]] in 1978. Unlike [[ASIN:B000001ESL Hemispheres]] and [[ASIN:B000001ESF 2112]], the songs on \\"Clockwork Angels\\" aren't segued together.  Each stands alone as part of the account.  Also different is the fact that the entire album is the story, not just one side (or the first part of the disk for those who weren't around for vinyl).  The boys did a fantastic job of reviving a format they had not attempted in 34 years.<br /><br />This chronicle teams Neil Peart up with science-fiction writer Kevin J. Anderson.  It's a steampunk piece about a traveler who leaves home and stumbles through a series of (mis)adventures.  It has a familiar Rush theme; i.e. the optimistic, free thinking individual in a world of tyranny.  I look forward to Anderson's September 2012 release of [[ASIN:1770411216 Clockwork Angels: The Novel]] in novel form.<br /><br />\\"Caravan\\" begins the saga as the traveler embarks on his journey.  He can't stop thinking big.  There are some long instrumental passages and it's good to hear big Al play some blazing solos again.  \\"BU2B\\" is about faith.  It starts out moody then starts rocking hard.  The title track is another tune that switches between hard and soft in a heartbeat as only Rush can.  There's some busy noodling going down on \\"The Anarchist\\".  The song is highlighted by the professors' killer drum licks and Lifeson's sinister psychedelic solo guitar tone.  \\"Halo Effect\\" is destined to be the Bic lighter track on the album.  It starts out soulfully acoustic.  It's a slow tempo (dare I use the dreaded term) power ballad.  The chorus of \\"The Wreckers\\" really strikes a chord with me.  Be wary indeed of miracles that are too good to be true.  There's nothing worse than hoping and praying for salvation only to get exploited in return.  How many people have been swindled by evangelists and so-called self-help gurus.  \\"Headlong Flight\\" is another up-tempo butt-kicker.  This is the earworm song for me as it seems to be stuck in my head.  I'm going to go ahead and say that it's my favorite track on the album so far. \\"Wish Them Well\\" is all about turning the other cheek; something we need a little more of these days.  \\"The Garden\\" brings the traveler full circle and is another Bic ballad.  It's message; you reap what you sow.<br /><br />Art director, Hugh Syme also deserves his props for doing an exceptional job with the packaging.  In a time of inexpressive digital downloading it's nice to know that some bands care enough to still put together a cool packaged booklet to go along with their music.  Included with the lyrics is a brief blurb that helps narrate the story.  The booklet also features stunning steampunk illustrations throughout.<br /><br />If you're a hardcore fan, (is there really any other kind of Rush fan?) you already own or are about to take delivery of \\"Clockwork Angels\\".

B006BG7RI0|1.0|I purchased this set and the only problem is with the audio on the BluRay version of the movie. Everything else works on the BluRay as well as the DVD. The DVD movie plays fine however I cannot get the BluRay audio to work within the movie. It will play in Spanish, Italian, Portuguese etc but not English. The BluRay player is new and yes, I did upgrade the software to the most current version. It is a new Samsung BluRay player and all other BluRay's work fine.
B005K17RU0|4.0|It updates frequently. I enjoy using it.<br />Easy to use. It gives all the info I am looking for. good app.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|lots of fun random games to play. great way to kill some time if you are bored and need something to do.
0762445262|5.0|Its pretty much what is advertised, a small Bat Signal, with a small book, the book is nothing special, but the signal its actually pretty cool, small, but cool, it actually projects the batsignal in a dark room, and it looks great as a night light for kids. And is cheap.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Its nice to have an app that actually does what it says on the description. I really like this calculator application especially the percent button.

B003LR4QPE|5.0|The question of whether to spend so little for so much music would merit no debate.  The question of whether to spend so little for so much divine music should be just inconceivable.<br /><br />Quibbling over this or that performance versus that of Rilling's players really is just nit-picking when deciding whether to buy this stupendous set.  You can't go wrong with the music -- we all know that.  Why not, then, just buy a complete set, bathe in it, find the pieces that move you, and then investigate other performances of those pieces?  There is never going to be the \\"final, perfect, definitive\\" set of Bach's complete surviving works.  I find that rather fun, though.  I'll be listening to this guy's music until the end of my days, yet there will always be another angle to explore.<br /><br />As Beethoven said of Bach (whose name means \\"stream\\" in German):  \\"Er hätte 'Meer' heißen sollen -- He should have been called 'ocean'.\\"
B0086700CM|4.0|it was overall good, but on the kindle fire it was very glitchy. Also I have had problems on it. Like when I got the red mega running thing it didn't turn and made me die. it ran right into the ocean!! but overall it was pretty good.

0345803485|5.0|This book happens to be one of the few books that I could not put down. It is true escapism with humor and raw sexual tension!!! This is not a book based on any reality and in a world which is full of sadness this is a must read!!! Please buy it and enjoy it.. I have recommended it to all I know!! Additionally who cares if it wins an award or not surely the reward to writer is how many copies are sold and acclaim from its readers!!!
B007ZZKWHY|4.0|Very silly, a tad forced in places, and who gives a crap? Pure, B movie fun, as was intended. Amazing effects considering their $10 million budget. This movie was silly, had a message but delivered it with the subtlety of a giant rubber mallet. It was the funnest load of crap I've ever watched. Highly recommended.<br /><br />(Note: this review was originally a reply to Hydra's review, but I decided to post it on its own.)
0140195076|5.0|This book sets the standard for authentic Jyotisha instruction. Like a rich, lush jungle, it rewards the intrepid explorer with treasures and medicine for the ills of ignorance.  Dense, and at times seemingly impenetrable, it is nonetheless a matchless source of wisdom for those who have disciplined their minds and prepared themselves to enter the dazzling universe of Jyotisha.<br />Be careful though, once inside, you may never want to leave.<br /><br />Goes well with [[ASIN:0984885927 Decoding Your Life Map With Vedic Astrology]]<br />and [[ASIN:0984885935 Decoding Your Life Map With Vedic Astrology Part II]]

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I really do not understand what is it all about???  This is not the only erotic book on the market. The language is plain and very repetitive..  I definitely will not call it a literature.  So the only explanation I have-- people buying it just to see what is all this noise about.  I have it for month and barely at 50%.  Definitely will not buy the rest .  Have to admire marketing job for this book .
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Addictive.  Very intense. Kept me wanting more after every episode. I can 't wait for season two to begin.  Worth the buy.
B0086700CM|5.0|there is a cheat on temple run start the game and press options turn on tutorial and play a round like normal when it says to turn turn swipe twice quickly for every turn now the game should go on forever with no turns or obstacles
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a really fun game to play. you are always doing something. my daughter enjoys playing it also. good game for all ages.
B0000549B0|5.0|The first time I saw HARVEY, I enjoyed it very much as a charming comedy with a touch of fantasy.  In a nutshell, it's about a guy named Elwood P. Dowd who keeps company with a giant, invisible rabbit named Harvey.  His sister and her daughter think he's nuts,  and his behavior is seriously cramping their style with the society folk in town.  His sister decides he should be committed to the local sanitarium so she and her daughter can get on with their lives.  But her attempts to put him away have unexpected results.<br /><br />I like this movie so much, I've seen it at least a dozen times over the past decade.  As I got older, I began to realize that the movie struck me a little differently every time I saw it.  New layers are exposed with each viewing - and finally I understood that under all that light-hearted whimsy, HARVEY is the story of a shattered man.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart played Elwood P. Dowd, Harvey's best buddy, in both the movie and the  stage version.  I doubt anyone else could have nailed the role.  Stewart is an essential American character, very much a product of his place and time.  He raises his voice when he's irritated or excited, but when he's truly angered or troubled, his voice becomes quieter.  As Elwood, he's unfailingly kind and courteous, so people respond to him warmly.  Elwood is so likeable, some people even continue to like him after he introduces them to the invisible rabbit.<br /><br />Elwood is younger than his sister, and their elderly mother doted on him.  She left the entire estate to him when she passed away, which is another reason his sister feels she has to wrest Power of Attorney from him.  He likes to invite people to supper at the home he shares with his sister and niece, regardless of who they are or how long he's known them (usually just a few minutes).  He is oblivious to class, race, religion, or any other social distinction, and in that time and place that's just plain awkward.  Elwood seems innocent, perhaps a bit simple, and childlike in his reaction to people.<br /><br />But if you really listen to him, you realize this is far from the case.  Before his mother died, Elwood used to be a different man.  As a member of the upper class, he moved among movers and shakers.  But something seems to have snapped in him.  He quotes his mother a lot, and one wonders if her death was a blow from which he couldn't completely recover.  His remarks also indicate a sense of futility in the pursuit of money, status,  and power.  After all, what good is any of that when the person you loved most in the world is gone?  His recovery from this loss is fragile, but something unexpected has come along to help him hold it together: Harvey the pookah becomes his friend, confidant, and drinking buddy.<br /><br />According to the movie, Pookahs are Celtic spirits with an odd sense of humor.  As the story begins to unfold, we find out that pookahs aren't just fun-loving, they have interesting powers, too.  For instance, they can stop time.  If they really like someone, they have a protective streak, too.  Elwood needs that protection, because the misguided doctor in the movie believes the only way to shock Elwood back into a normal life is to give him a chemical lobotomy in the form of a drug.  If HARVEY were just about this dreadful injection, it would be a horror movie.  Before the whole thing is over, you wonder if sweet, kind-hearted Elwood won't be shattered for good.<br /><br />The story in HARVEY works on multiple levels, and that alone would make it a good movie.  But it also has a marvelous cast, and their deft performances are unforgettable.  A less skilled actor than Stewart might have overplayed Elwood's simplicity, or camped up the whole invisible rabbit thing.  Instead, Stewart plays the part not only with perfect comic timing, but also with a subtlety that allows you to understand Elwood's character once you really start to listen.  The dark undercurrent in Elwood's life reminds me of a heart-breaking scene in the movie IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, another story that's often described as too sugary and feel-good.  Anyone who describes it that way must not have seen the scene in which Stewart's character George Bailey, at the end of his rope after a large sum of money has disappeared, prays desperately to God for help.  When God answers the prayer, it's not with an instant fix (Here's the money, pal - good luck!).  Instead, he finds a way to let George know his life matters to people, that he's not alone.<br /><br />Harvey finds a way to do that for Elwood, too.  By the end of the movie, you realize that Elwood and Harvey probably have the best approach to life after all.  And that's why HARVEY is another permanent resident of my Best Movies list.f a heart-breaking scene in the movie IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, another story that's often described as too sugary and feel-good.

B000BEZPQE|3.0|I absolutely love \\"Wait and Bleed\\" and \\"Before I Forget.\\" After that, I am only a casual Slipknot fan. Please take this into consideration when reading this review. I was looking for a \\"best of\\" album and this is the closest thing the band has out as far as I know. I enjoy the \\"concert feel\\" of live albums but this one just isn't for me. Corey, at times, sounds lazy in getting out the vocals and some of the songs can be difficult to sing along to if you are used to the album versions. You'll want this album is you're a completest or a diehard fan but it's an easy pass otherwise.

0307716546|5.0|Prior to selecting Rosamund Lupton's novel \\"Afterwards,\\" I had never heard of her; nevertheless, this is one of the most riveting novels that I have ever read.  The thrilling twists and turns kept me guessing while the plot develops \\"as if a painting-by-numbers portrait is being filled in, one color at a time.\\"<br /><br />This is a remarkable story told primarily from the out-of-body perspective of a mother and daughter, unconscious and hospitalized after being hurt in a catastrophic school fire.  One other adult is injured and in the hospital as a result of the fire; however, no students were hurt.<br /><br />Suspense and mystery intertwine as the author develops relationships of over a dozen interesting characters from four different families, the school and the police department. Investigations reveal suspects and theories of who planned and executed this crime and why and whether or not the mother or daughter will survive the ordeal.<br /><br />When the police seem determine to close the investigation based on the testimony of a secret witness, blaming the fire on a child playing with matches, Sarah, a police officer and the aunt and sister-in-law of two of the victims puts her job in jeopardy, by conducting her own unauthorized investigation, determined to protect those she loves and bring those responsible to justice.<br /><br />In the context of this story family dynamics are developed and I found one particulate paragraph so profound that I would like to share it here.  \\"It's not the fledgling birds that are thrown out of the nest by their parents and made to fly; it's the parents who are made to get the hell out of the cozy family nest by their teenage offspring.  It's we who are made to be independent of them, crash-landing if we don't manage it.\\"<br /><br />This is an extremely well written, unique and exciting story that I really could not put down.  My guess is that your experience will be equally delightful!<br /><br />Enjoy!
B007KAJG3K|1.0|Be careful, the listings and packaging for the \\"Movie only edition\\" don't mention that it's missing two significant items.<br /><br />#1 despite having a sticker on it saying \\"Watch with Robert Downey Jr in Maximum Movie Mode\\" the single disc version does not have the feature.<br /><br />#2 The single disc version has a flyer for \\"Sherlock Holmes 2 Second Screen\\" application for the ipad ala the way Disney does it, but once again the disc does not have the feature nor does the app say that it only works with SOME versions.<br /><br />Shame on you Warner Brothers for making a stripped version but not even knowing what it contains in its own packaging!

B005LAIHXQ|5.0|In 1979 \\"Alien\\" was part of the science fiction boom created by \\"Star Wars.\\" Although \\"Alien\\" was essentially a horror movie in space, it adhered to the \\"Star Wars\\" philosophy of a \\"used\\" universe where everything is functional, it looks used and lived in as a deep space voyage would be. \\"Alien\\" also spawned several sequels (to varying degrees of success) and now \\"Alien\\" follows \\"Star Wars\\" into the land of prequels.<br /><br />\\"Prometheus\\" starts in the year 2089 when a pair of archeologists, Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) discover the oldest cave paintings that depict giant aliens pointing to a star system they couldn't possibly have known about. The next thing we know the archeologists and team of scientists are off on a mission, paid for by the ultimately corrupt Weyland Corporation, to the mystery planet which turns out to be LV-426, here named LV-23. Although the planet isn't as inhospitable as it is in \\"Alien\\", they quickly discover a series of pyramids and set off to explore the nearest one (rather impetuously). They quickly discover alien  holograms that lead them to the fossilized remains of the alien seen in the spaceship in \\"Alien\\" and discover a room full of canisters and the statue of a head with very human like features. David (Michael Fassbinder), an android, soon demonstrates a propensity for carrying a secret agenda different from the stated goals of the mission In space you shouldn`t trust an android.<br /><br />One of the mistakes sequels and prequels make is to try and remake the original movie by recycling scenes from the original and giving them a slightly different context. While \\"Prometheus\\" gives its fair share of nods and homage to \\"Alien\\" they're reimagined in \\"Prometheus\\" and the \\"Alien\\" reference or scene isn't dependent or redolent of \\"Alien.\\"<br /><br />There have been numerous comparisons between \\"Prometheus\\" and \\"2001\\" and parallels certainly exist. The most obvious is the introductory \\"creation\\" scene of life on earth which is the rough equivalent to the monolith in \\"2001\\" spurring the explosion of intelligence in the hominids. Michael Fassbinder as David is the HAL of the movie with a little Jude Law from \\"A.I.\\" and Michael Rennie from \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\" and perhaps a little David Bowie (although Peter O'Toole in \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" is referenced). The plots of \\"Prometheus\\" and \\"2001\\" are similar. The search for a higher intelligence, God, that created us and the search for answers although \\"Prometheus\\" is a film for the 21st century and has a darker vision of the future than the forward looking \\"2001\\" of the late 60's and 20th century did. There's even a scene towards the end that could qualify as the psychedelic scene at the end of \\"2001\\". Or is Guy Pearce as a corrupt industrialist doing an homage to Keir Dullea as the old man at the end of \\"2001\\"?<br /><br />Director Ridley Scott (\\"Alien\\" and \\"Blade Runner\\" among others) gives us a movie with lush visuals and a panoramic scope (which I guess made for great viewing of the movie in 3-D), and the acting he gets from the cast is top notch. A special nod should be given to Charlize Theron as the ice queen commander of the ship, but she manages to interject a bit of humanity into the role and doesn't deserve the end she meets in the movie.<br /><br />While there are some plot holes in the film and some that are instantly obvious, ignore them, there's more going on in this movie that holds your attention and as the story moves along. We become intrigued as to the origin and intentions of the giant aliens that drew the humans to the planet, as the \\"Alien\\" creature evolves, moving us and the story closer to the \\"Alien\\" we all know and enjoy.<br /><br />It's a rare movie that I didn't want to see end and when it did end I wanted to see more.ation\\" scene of life on earth which is the rough equivalent to the monolith in \\"2001\\" spurring the explosion of intelligence in the hominids.

There's even a scene towards the end that could qualify as the psychedelic scene at the end of \\"2001\\". Or is Guy Pearce as a corrupt industrialist doing an homage to Keir Dullea as the old man at the end of \\"2001\\"?<br /><br />Director Ridley Scott (\\"Alien\\" and \\"Blade Runner\\" among others) gives us a movie with lush visuals and a panoramic scope (which I guess made for great viewing of the movie in 3-D), and the acting he gets from the cast is top notch. A special nod should be given to Charlize Theron as the ice queen commander of the ship, but she manages to interject a bit of humanity into the role and doesn't deserve the end she meets in the movie.<br /><br />While there are some plot holes in the film and some that are instantly obvious, ignore them, there's more going on in this movie that holds your attention and as the story moves along. We become intrigued as to the origin and intentions of the giant aliens that drew the humans to the planet, as the \\"Alien\\" creature evolves, moving us and the story closer to the \\"Alien\\" we all know and enjoy.<br /><br />It's a rare movie that I didn't want to see end and when it did end I wanted to see more.
B00633PFQC|5.0|In his book [[ASIN:0375704477 Property and Freedom]], Richard Pipes brilliantly argues that the institution of property rights forms the one necessary ingredient to establishing and maintaining freedom. Pipes further argues that because property rights protect our freedom, society must not impede the exercise of those rights. Markets are the means by which we exchange property, and limiting the ability to trade property would be equivalent to limiting our freedom.<br /><br />There are problems with this point of view. First our freedom is constrained to begin with. Even in an egalitarian society, we are constrained by the freedom of others. Second, we are constrained by the facts of life: we must labor to eat, we can only make use of a limited number of resources, and in the end we die anyway. Freedom is precious but perfect freedom is a mirage.<br /><br />In this book, Michael Sandel exposes and describes the moral problems that result from the unfettered exercise of property rights. There are things that we value that cannot, or at least should not, be bought and sold or things that become corrupted by the act of selling and buying them.<br /><br />Sandel opens with the problem of jumping the queue. What's wrong with scalping theater tickets? I bought tickets for a show which is now sold out, I know someone willing to pay three times what I paid for the tickets, so why should I not be allowed to sell that person my ticket? Most people don't have a moral problem with this. But what about a free performance of Shakespeare in Central Park that is sponsored by the City of New York and where the actors perform for free or for a nominal fee? The city and the actors want people to come and enjoy Shakespeare without having to worry about being able to afford the ticket or not. A scalper selling his seat perverts this intention and neither the city nor the actors are getting what they are working for.<br /><br />Or consider life insurance. Three hundred years ago, life insurance was seen as an immoral wager on someone's life. In time, society came to recognize that the death of a breadwinner could financially destroy a family so it made sense to protect the family against untimely death. People entered into life insurance contracts early in life and kept paying the premiums as long as needed to protect their families. As we grow older, we save money into our retirement funds and eventually our kids move out and we let our insurance contract lapse; forty percent of term life insurance policies are never cashed in, and life insurance companies take this into account when pricing premiums. Now consider a sixty five year old man with his mortgage paid and his children out of college. He would let his policy lapse and save the premiums to pay for something else. Someone comes and offers to buy his policy, pay the premiums, and receive the insurance amount when he dies. Why not? The problem with this is that the buyer doesn't really have an insurable interest in the insurance policy; he is just placing a bet. Another problem is that such activity makes term life insurance more expensive for everyone since premiums will inevitably rise if the policies are always held until death.<br /><br />In both cases, and in many others described by Sandel, trading these items in a market corrupts the things being bought and sold. Sandel closes with a question. As we start buying and selling everything and anything, market thinking enters into every facet of our life and so it is changing our world. Do we want to live in such a world?<br /><br />Vincent Poirier, Tokyourance was seen as an immoral wager on someone's life.

B006OAB3ME|3.0|Over the years, many pop and rock singers have taken on The Great American Songbook with varying results. Harry Nilsson (who may have started this trend with his A LITTLE TOUCH OF SCHMILSSON IN THE NIGHT back in 1973) did one of the nicest ones. Linda Ronstadt revitalized her career (not that it really needed it) with her three albums with the late Nelson Riddle. Willie Nelson has done a couple of them, too. Even Ringo, God help us, took them on with his \\"for me Dad\\" SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY. Now Paul McCartney, who used to play bass in a band Ringo was in, has jumped onto the bandwagon with KISSES ON THE BOTTOM. (The \\"naughty\\" title is, of course, a line from the song \\"I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter\\"...but you probably knew that, didn't you?) This is a mixed blessing. Read on...<br /><br />For one thing, it's nice to hear him do (mostly) wonderful old standards. (He contributed a couple of tunes, which don't measure up to the standards set by the standards.) And it's nice to hear him singing in a lower register. I doubt that he's lost his top range, but why blast these songs up there? Good move. And for another thing, it's nice to hear him with such lovely, tasty, jazzy, sweet backing (thanks in large part to Diana Krall and her gang).<br /><br />But every review has a \\"but.\\" Mine is his phrasing...which is dreadful! Take the first line of the first song, \\"I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter.\\" In McCartney's world, this comes out \\"I'm gonna sit right down [BREATH] and write myself [BREATH] a letter.\\" Come on, Paul! Don't you have enough wind to get through the title of the song without breathing TWICE? Compare this, say, to Harry Nilsson's rendition of Irving Berlin's \\"What'll I Do?\\" This is one of the hardest songs to phrase properly, since the entire \\"A\\" stanza up to the last (title) line is one thought. Nilsson managed it...and he's pictured on the cover with a cigarette in his mouth. Phrasing is something that far too few singers pay attention to nowadays. In the far distant past I used to coach singers, and this was one of the points I always stressed, along with \\"sing for the meaning of the lyrics.\\" Paul McCartney never showed up for his lesson with me...<br /><br />To sum it up, it's nice that Sir Paul has taken on the classics and it's nice that he's branched off from his usual style. But if there's to be a follow-up album, I hope he reads this and takes it to heart. (Not likely, is it?)
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The book is ok but not what I expected.  It was sufficiently interesting for me to finish it within 24 hours but I just don't see what the hype is about.  The writing style is pretty simple, enough for kids to be able to read.  It's also not anywhere near as brutal as I expected from the hype.  It's no more violent than Harry Potter or LOTR.  It had a couple of strong emotional moments for me but nothing close to what I've experienced in other books in the sci-fi/fantasy genre.<br /><br />Overall I'll give it 3 stars.  It was worth a read but was only average entertainment value.  I was disappointed enough that I don't plan on reading the other two books in the series.  Disclaimer: I haven't seen the movie either.

0375842209|5.0|Summary<br />German, Liesel Meminger is left with foster parents Rosa and Hans Hubermann in a town called Molching on a cold winter night; her brother is dead, having died on the train, and her mother, unable to feed and care for her children anymore, is gone.<br />Liesel settles in with the Hubermanns, grows accustomed to Rosa's sharp tongue and Hans' gentleness and understanding and discovers a best friend, Rudy Steiner.  Life in Hitler's Germany is tough even for non-Jewish Germans...their food is rationed, there are no extras of anything, there are strict rules to follow and family members may be taken away at any time to serve Hitler in whatever way he so chooses.<br />The families do everything possible to keep life as normal as possible.<br />Hans begins to read with Liesel each night when she wakens from her nightmares, first from A Gravediggers Handbook that Liesel, \\"The Book Thief,\\" recovered after it was lost in the snow by an apprentice gravedigger at her brother's burial and then from books Liesel steals from the mayor's wife's library.  She later continues her reading and writing lessons in the basement with a Jew named Max (the son of an old friend of Hans) who shows up one night needing help.<br />Life gets tougher on Himmel Street; the war begins spiraling out of control, Jews are marched down the street of Molching on their way to concentration camps, air raid sirens become part of normal life, Rosa loses many of her washing jobs bc of prejudice, and the family is frightened for their lives 24/7 if Max is found in their basement.<br />Is it even possible for this story to have a happy ending?<br />Should it?<br /><br />What I Liked<br /><br />Death, the narrator - foreshadowing - I could almost hear music...you know the kind that comes on while you're watching a scary movie...the killer is around the corner...if only the heroine could hear the music, right??  That's when everybody starts screaming, \\"Don't you go in there, Girl!! Just don't do it!\\"  Even when you've seen the movie before, you still hope that she won't go in there...that's how this story felt to me.<br />I knew how it would end.  We all do.<br /><br />Liesel - in the past when someone mentioned the name Liesel, I would think of the older sister in \\"The Sound of Music\\"...that won't happen anymore.  This Liesel is unforgettable.  Her strength, her soul, her ability to adjust to her surroundings, her ability to pick up and keep moving, her ability to love, her ability to see the world around her realistically...all of that and more...nevermind the fact that this child is only 9-13 years old throughout the story.<br /><br />Format - I'm sure there's a word for this type of structure, but I don't  know what it is...The narrator, Death, goes back and forth in time as he pleases and interrupts the flow with comments and/or bolded newsflashes of sort.  I would think the danger of this kind of format would be a chopped up feel, but there is none of that here.  Quite the contrary, the most effective flashes and context seem to be incorporated seamlessly this way.<br /><br />Death complaining about having too much on his plate - Most of us see Death as that hooded creature with the scythe...it's a Hollywood version that's become ingrained in our brains.  But, Death as the storyteller in The Book Thief doesn't seem to be a frightening thing at all...the way he gently scoops the victims up in his arms and takes them away, the way Death truly mourns over the lives of worthy humans, the way Death sees all that's happening in the world as a waste, but not something he can stop almost endears him to the reader.  I could go on and on about the symbolism here...how mankind hurts itself over and over, etc. but I'll let you experience that for yourself.<br /><br />The humor - both Death's sarcastic remarks and Liesel and Rudy's attempts to carry on conversations with adult words tickled me from time to time.  I appreciated the ability to have a rest every now and then from subject matter that weighed so heavily on my chest.  The German curse words were my favorites :)<br /><br />The History - once again there are things here that I never even knew about...scores of Jews escaped Germany while they were able and ended up in Australia...hence, Zusak's (an Australian) interest in the Jewish families who survived and the members/branches of those families who were left behind and essentially wiped off the face of the earth.<br /><br />Hans Hubermann - how the heck do you not like a man like Hans?<br /><br />What I Didn't Like<br /><br />There is literally nothing about this novel that I didn't like, except of course, the subject matter.  How in the world this part of our history exists completely baffles me.  And, then sometimes it doesn't; I can look around at the world we live in today and see some of the same mindset that guided the worst genocide in our nation's history, and I get scared.  Really.<br /><br />Hitler was one man.<br />One of the statistics Death brings out in this novel is that at one point in history 90% of Germans backed Hitler.<br />90%.<br />Out of every 100 people, 90 of them believed what Hiltler proposed was right and/or believed that his strategies/actions had to happen in order to create a powerful German human race.<br /><br />Even as I type those words, it seems so stupid...like something we'd all snicker at and say the person needs psychiatric help.<br />But, time and time again, things happen that we think never would.<br />How did this happen?<br />90%.<br />It's called blind conformity.<br />It's a disease, and...<br /><br />This book is a classic.<br /><br />Overall Recommendation<br /><br />Everybody needs to read this book.<br />The End.hen from subject matter that weighed so heavily on my chest.

B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Part Stargate, part Alien, and part Jaws, Prometheus is as good a sci-fi movie as has been made in the past ten years.  Hyperbole?  In the eye of this beholder not at all.  I was on the edge of my seat throughout the whole 2+ hours, and was disappointed when the movie ended because I felt like I was only the theater about 60 minutes.  The visuals, acting, and score carry this movie, and for those of us who remember the first Alien movie there are nods to that earlier franchise throughout this epic.  This is the kind of movie that I'd like to be able to go back in time to see again because this experience was truly entertaining.<br /><br />I recommend watching this in a very dark room, and turning off all your cell phones, regular phones, and any other electronics that might interrupt your viewing.  Give this all your attention and you'll be richly rewarded.
B004KZDV8E|5.0|My 4 year old i5-750 Lynnfield bit the dust due to the cpu fan header stopped working and fried the chip. Needed<br />one fast and although the Egg was $15 cheaper and I have to pay tax at Amazon I ordered it anyway. Amazon ships fast and although I opted for 2 day shipping I got it next day. I put it into a new Asrock motherboard that I also ordered. 15 minutes later the cpu was humming along quite nicely. After receiving order Amazon credited me $15 due to the Eggs cheaper price. There is no other company that I have dealt with that has the excellent customer support that Amazon has. I would rather pay my 8% sales tax knowing that I will have excellent support after the fact.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Cheap.<br />Fast, same WEI score as the older Lynnfield<br />On board video, I don't do games so it was a nice bonus<br />Quiet, even with standard cpu fan/cooler<br /><br />Cons:<br />The eyeroll the wife gave me while I was bent over hooking up the cables, due to my plumbers view that she saw.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I have been a Rush fan since 1975. They're probably my favorite band. Their recordings often differ from one another as their tastes and interests change (and mine do too) so the direction CA took is no surprise at all. I love that Alex has stepped up his game a little and has added many really nice guitar licks and is showing his chops again! The Rush chemistry just works as it always has --- with Peart supplying lyrical content and direction as well as some really ass kicking drumming and Lee and Lifeson writing the musical content and arrangements what the hell is not to like?<br />:))))))))))<br /><br />How many more albums will they do (this is #20)!? You gotta love whatever they put out just because. BUT ------ this is REALLY a nice piece of work anyway! Well done guys!<br />Sort of amazing that after all these years they still LOVE their CRAFT! Well, I do too!<br /><br />I hear parts of many other Rush albums in this one. Sounds like you would imagine it would sound. It's classic Rush yet new at the same time.<br />I like the concept album thing they do.<br />Can't wait to see them (twice) on this years tour!<br />ROCK ON GUYS!<br />****Any Rush fan will LOVE this album****
B002JVWR4A|5.0|I'm a big fan of Bones, especially Seasons 1-3, which in my opinion were the better seasons of this show. Without the character of Zac Addy, I find there is a big gap in the camadrie and humor that made this show. The revolving squiterns are interesting, but can be quite annoying.<br />The episodes, as usual are interesting and at times, humorous. I particularly find the episods with Angela's father appearing to be very funny. The episode in which Hodgins and Nigel Murray try to figure out how a frozen corpse shattered was a hoot.<br />If you're a fan of Bones, I recommend this set without hesitation.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|This movie was a little hard to follow in the beginning & isn't non stop action, but my whole family was hooked by the end.  Great special effects, and the movie kind of had a retro fun feel to it like the Spielberg films from the 80s.  It's really a shame more people didn't see this in the theater as it killed any chance for sequels.  The 3D isn't the most eye popping I've seen, but still pretty good & worth it if you own a 3D TV.

B005LAII08|3.0|MOVIE REVIEW #39: \\" Brave \\"<br /><br />I never thought I would ever write a review about a Pixar film like this one. It probably works better on the small screen (Blu Ray/DVD) but Disney's/Pixar release of director Brenda Chapman's (The Prince of Egypt) film Brave was a little more than disappointing.  I can see why this took 5 years to make and was pushed back with its release date two times.<br /><br />Beautifully looking and deeply rich in Celtic culture it really lacks the full spectrum of the movie by grabbing you in the beginning and holding you. It's a mother and daughter film definitely and the best scenes are really only with them together. It does have a lush score by Patrick Doyle (Hamlet, Thor) - but even that didn't carry the film for me. Again it was made for 3-D - which it didn't really need - I think the glasses took away from the detail and majesty of the colors, textures and all the scenery itself in the film. (Just another attempt to charge more ticket prices at the box office, in my opinion..)<br /><br />The story to me was a little simple and took a long while to get to the real `heart' of the film. It's about Merida, (Voiced by Kelly Macdonald of Boardwalk Empire and No Country For Old Men) who is a skilled archer and impetuous daughter of King Fergus (Voiced by Billy Connolly of The Last Samurai and Lemony Snickets) and - the one she conflicts with most, her mother Queen Elinor (Voiced by Emma Thompson of Nanny McPhee and Love Actually).<br /><br /> Determined to carve her own path in life, Merida defies an age-old custom sacred to the uproarious lords of the land - Betrothal: with - the overly massive Lord MacGuffin (Voiced by Kevin Mckidd of Trainspotting and Kingdom of Heaven), the hugely surly Lord Macintosh (Voiced by Craig Ferguson of How To Train Your Dragon and Winnie The Pooh)  and cantankerous Lord Dingwall (Voiced by Robbie Coltrane of Harry Potter and Goldeneye).<br /><br />Merida's actions inadvertently unleash chaos and fury in the kingdom, - as well as creating a huge riff in her relationship with her mother - and when she mistakenly turns to an eccentric old Witch for help, (Voiced by Julie Walters of Harry Potter and Mama Mia!), she is granted a strange wish to `change' her mother. A wish she later learns to regret and make the entire kingdom threaten her mother in a very mortal way. The ensuing peril forces Merida to harness all of her skills and resources -- including her clever and mischievous triplet brothers -- to undo a beastly curse before it's too late. She does this by learning how and summoning up her own Bravery!<br /><br />Those three brothers end up being a VERY minor comic relief for the film. They could have done so much more with them, but the few scenes they had were `slapsticky' and quick with wit and humor - but not much.<br /><br />Sounds great to hear story-wise- but to me the execution of the script was slow and the dialogue a little garbled due to the thick Celtic dialects overlapping a lot of the time. The screenplay written by Marc Andrews (John Carter) , Steve Purcell (Cars), Brenda Chapman (Cars, Beauty and the Beast) and Irene Mecci (Annie, Hercules) and need more heart and continuity to me.<br /><br />The best scenes were always between Merida and her mother. Whether happy, arguing or dealing with a `change' - they were spot on! An extremely tear jerking moment is when her mother, in another form, realizes what's important to both her and her daughter and has to communicate this `change' to her daughter in a most unconventional, funny and heartfelt way!<br /><br />Definitely a good film for the younger audiences and a family film - but  I definitely got the reaction/impression that it is geared more toward the female crowd (with a little action and a little violence thrown in for the men) and as such suffered the continuity and balance for a general audience. I think it was trying to be the female version of Finding Nemo. But it won't hold a candle to that classic Pixar film!<br /><br />I wanted to enjoy it more....but it didn't have the Pixar heart I am so used and was excited and hoping to see again in a Pixar film. I am sure when I get the Bu Ray/DVD - it will work better. Some films work better on the small screen - this one needed a lot of help on the big one for me.assic Pixar film!<br /><br />I wanted to enjoy it more....but it didn't have the Pixar heart I am so used and was excited and hoping to see again in a Pixar film.

B0034G4OXQ|4.0|Clint Eastwood is in his directing prime, and he keeps cranking out mega hits, including this one. They keep the religious overtones on the down-low. They ask why we wonder what happens when we die. It's a million-year-old question that started with the Egyptians, or probably before. There are no answers. The film takes its time to build. Some may say it's slow. I think it's paced just right. There's a great opening sequence that shows the Indonesian tsunami in frightening realism. Great CGI work there. I was worried we were in for some gory deaths early on, but that's not the case. Worth watching.

0385342039|3.0|Great story almost reads like a mystery! Quirky with an equal amount of drama. At first, reading this fantasy/sci fi story motivated me to want to read more by this author.<br /><br />But here is where I draw the line on rating this 5 stars...<br /><br />As charming and tender-hearted as this story is, the author uses the F word far too many times (I actually look for 'cleaner books' sans the cursing) which ruins the story for me!<br /><br />It is almost as if someone stood back - examined the draft and asked - now where can we stick in this F word and how many times can we use it?<br /><br />It is unnecessary and the story is creative enough that not having thrown in a curse word (far too frequently) would have stood on its own.<br /><br />Re-thinking if I even want to continue reading this author's books now... it has kind of ruined it for me.<br /><br />I will never understand why authors believe in order to make something real, profanity must be used... I think it is a cop out and shows who they are or how they think they must 'conform'.

This story was overwhelmingly gut wrenching for me and should be a must read for every American who for one second thinks they have done enough for this wonderful country we live in. My throat is constricted right now as I recall some of the passages in Fearless told through the eyes of his team members, family and friends whose lives were all touched by this magnificent American Hero.  I can't express my gratitude for Mr. Blehm in the manner in which he carefully, honestly and with great dignity described the life of Adam Brown.  I am very proud to be an American and always hold my head up high.  This book made me hold it a little higher.  Thank you<br />David A. Garcia

The only thing I don't like so much is the mix...I'd like a little less bass and a little more treble, especially since sometimes I can hardly hear Peart's symbols over the rest of the instruments. Otherwise, this album is amazing and it leaves me wanting MORE RUSH!!!!! P.S., my wife, who doesn't like Rush, wanted a copy of this album for her car. That is saying a lot!!

B004XN3FHA|1.0|I received this flashlight from Amazon last week. I immediately noticed 2 problems.<br /><br />1. The F and E letters in FENIX were dirty. As in greasy dirt on top of the WHITE letters. The same thing for the 41 in TK41.<br /><br />2. The plastic case had a substantial crack on both halves of the case. The plastic case folds open into 2 equal pieces. The plastic material (that the case is constructed of) is 1/16\\" thick. It would take a substantial force to crack the case.<br /><br />From my observations, I can conclude one of 2 things.<br /><br />1. This flashlight is a SECOND ( in other words, a flawed item) from Fenix.<br /><br />  OR<br /><br />2. This flashlight had been used, and then returned to Amazon. And then shipped, as new, to me from Amazon.<br /><br />I contacted Amazon. I was told, that at the time Amazon did not have a replacement TK41 available. Amazon will be crediting my CC in the amount of $50. However, that does not resolve the issue of receiving a damaged/flawed item from Amazon.

B004A8ZX28|4.0|Liam Neeson seems to be following Michael Caine's mid-career trajectory; a tall, able actor with great screen presence takes any script - good, bad, and indifferent - in order to work regularly.  In \\"Unknown,\\" Neeson plays a mild-mannered doctor and devoted husband who faces a shocking identity crisis while visiting Berlin.  Many viewers have drawn parallels between this film and 2008's Neeson action film \\"Taken;\\" thankfully, this film seems quite different, and much better.<br /><br />Though both \\"Taken\\" and \\"Unknown\\" are action/suspense films, Neeson's character in the latter film spends most of the story as a highly-vulnerable \\"everyman.\\"  His plight - thrown into a strange, cold city in which no one recognizes him - could be taken from a thousand dreams (or at least a hundred Phillip K. Dick short stories).  The premise is so commonplace that the plot could have been derivative and tedious, but it holds and maintains tension quite well.  It also taps into common wish-fulfillment; we all would like to be more than meets the eye.  As one character says: \\"It's all about the details.\\"  And so it is; those details give this film flavor and heft.<br /><br />The supporting cast lend the film much of its interest.  Frank Langella and Bruno Ganz are superb here.  Berlin itself has a great supporting role; it's chilling in its distinctive \\"Berlin Blue\\" which many directors and cinematographers have labored to perfect.<br /><br />\\"Unknown\\" has its flaws; I automatically deduct a star from almost any film with a car chase.  If it's not \\"The French Connection\\" or \\"Bullitt,\\" it's filler.  The chase is blessedly brief.  The actress portraying the doctor's wife is also a liability, but the film survives these flaws.<br /><br />Shrewd viewers might anticipate the film's twist long in advance, but for most of us, it's worth the journey.
B00782O7IY|4.0|This clever take on the silent era is a valentine (note the titular character's name) to Old Hollywood and especially to lovers of classic movies. Unknown French director Michel Hazanavicius, who also wrote the screenplay, wanted to take on the challange of making a silent film, complete with black & white photography & title cards, in the 21st century. To say that he succeeded (whether you like the film or not) cannot be denied.<br /><br />The movie opens in 1927 Hollywood. Silent superstar George Valentin (a combination of Douglas Fairbanks Sr & John Gilbert & played by French actor Jean Dujardin) is about to be caught up in the transition to sound. While he is dealing with this crisis, young extra Peppy Miller (a cross between the young Joan Crawford, Clara Bow, & Gloria Swanson & winningly played by Berenice Bejo who just happens to be the director's wife) makes the transition to sound and is on her way up. The parallel to A STAR IS BORN is obvious along with several other references to classic films such as CITIZEN KANE (the breakfast scene), SINGIN' IN THE RAIN (the sound test), & THE THIN MAN (the dog). For the end sequence, pick the Astaire-Rogers musical of your choice.<br /><br />Along with the French performers, two American character actors are given prominent roles in the proceedings. John Goodman plays the classic Hollywood studio head complete with fat cigar while James Cromwell is George's loyal chauffeur (a reference to SUNSET BOULEVARD). Both adapt themselves well to the silent medium. While there are several references to other classic Hollywood films, THE ARTIST is more than just a simple homage. It's also the heartwarming story of two people headed in different directions with some lightweight comedy thrown in & one classic scene between Berenice Bejo & an empty coat.<br /><br />Despite all the critical praise, THE ARTIST does have some issues from my perspective as an instructor on silent movies. Most of them are visual and won't be noticed by the casual filmgoer. The number one problem is with the lighting. Most silent films have a much more varied contrast between light & shadow (even the comedies of Chaplin, Keaton & Lloyd) but then silent films weren't shot in color on modern equipment and then turned into black & white. This also gives the film a rather flat look on occasion which becomes somewhat boring after awhile. I would have liked to see the lighting and photography change as the time frame moved from the silent to the sound era.<br /><br />But this is scholarly nitpicking. I was delighted at how well THE ARTIST captures the spirit of the era although that era is much more the early 1930s than the late 1920s. I am even more delighted that it's reaching a mainstream audience who are now discovering the world of the silent cinema for the first time. In interviews director Hazanavicius said that that is what he hoped his \\"little film\\" would do, which it has. Silent films are not for everyone and never will be but they are a valid art form as different from sound films as ballet is from opera. For opening the door to a wider appreciation of the films of the distant past, THE ARTIST deserves its accolades.the casual filmgoer. The number one problem is with the lighting.

B007WFR1MQ|5.0|Must say I was completely impressed with the first ten tracks of the album, particularly the first three (Recharger, New Messiah, God Eater). The last two are \\"bonus\\" so I'm fine with writing them off as far as the overall audio experience is concerned. In that sense you're probably better off with the standard version of the album unless you're a die-hard fan.<br />On the whole this is probably not as good as Archetype, Demanufacture, Obsolete or Mechanize but it's still a very close race to the top. If you're a Fear Factory fan on any level you'll definitely want a copy of this album.<br />The Industrialist is where Burton C. Bell has shown that he is the soul of the machine.

1781161097|3.0|I often buy production design books; most are well-done, but the films they are based on can be... iffy.  This book is a nicely-produced hard cover edition.  The pages are thick and glossy, the artwork well-rendered.  It is also substantial; this is no \\"Art of Avatar\\" fifty page effort, thank you very much.<br /><br />Looking through this book, I find myself in the same quandary as that faced in 1979 when looking at The Book of Alien; I am measuring the volume of tech design - which I love - versus slithery creature features.  Whereas the former sits proudly (albeit dustily) on my bookshelf, I am tempted to send The Art of Prometheus back.  This is not because the book is in any way ineptly done, it's simply the ratio of tech to \\"Blech!\\" is low.<br /><br />One other thing (if anybody's reading this); we all know that Swiss surrealist Hans Rudi Giger's designs made \\"Alien\\" special.  Before \\"Alien,\\" movie monsters were variations of terrestrial organisms.  Giger's stuff was disturbing and otherworldly.  This film's designers drew inspiration from Giger's designs, but made the incredibly foolish decision to take the \\"bio\\" out of Giger's \\"biomechanical\\" look.  \\"Prometheus'\\" monsters seem like a throwback to the pre-Giger era; we have (in no particular order) eel aliens, disfigured person aliens, squid aliens, and a cross between Giger's \\"alien dessert,\\" and a plum pudding.  Despite the general competence of this production crew, their lack of inspiration is obvious.  Even Scott's idea that the famed \\"Space Jockey\\" is just a humanoid in a suit is deeply disappointing.

B004LWZW8S|5.0|\\"300\\" was quite a spectacle as it combined fantastic special effects with a Roman theme along with great action sequences. Continuing this trend is \\"Immortals\\" where King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke, \\"The Wrestler\\" & \\"Iron Man 2\\") wants to find a weapon called the Epirius Bow so he can wage a titanic war on both Heaven and Earth. The gods want to stop him and call upon a young man named Theseus (Henry Cavill TV's \\"The Tudors\\") to stop him and a beautiful woman named Phaedra (Freida Pinto, \\"Slumdog Millionaire) helps him in his quest.<br /><br />The story while basic is quite good, the acting is decent to good, Rourke is especially evil as Hyperion, Cavill is the typical young hero and Pinto is just stunning as the Oracle. However the main drawing point of this movie is the great fight sequences and visuals that make this film a joy to view especially in Blu-Ray. Its not quite as good as \\"300\\" as that was a joy from start to finish but Immortals does have a grand scope about it and is so so much better than the lousy remake of \\"Clash of the Titans\\". ***1/2 out of 4 stars.
0385340540|4.0|Agree with others that this certainly was not Grisham's best book.  However, if you like Italy and (like us) you are going to Bologna or have been there recently, you'll love this book.  I had read The Broker a couple of years ago right after we decided to take a trip to the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy.  Just got back from our trip last month, and decided to read the book again. Liked it a lot both times.<br />If you've not been there and have no plans to visit the region, the book will probably seem quite boring, as it lingers a bit too long on food and sights in and around Bologna.  And, the plot is kind of all over the place.  Plus, the ending seemed somewhat rushed and abbreviated, as if the author just got tired of writing.<br />I would give the book a 3.5 star rating if I could, but I'll round up to 4 because we love that part of Italy, and Grisham does an excellent job of describing many of its high spots and capturing much of its charm.
B001KVZ6HK|1.0|Most people see these movies in the theater before they make it to dvd, so why give a long description of the story which only leaves out the ending.<br />Those who've seen it know the story, those that haven't & wait for the dvd's (Blu-Ray, 3D, or Standard)only need a short taster to know why to get it.<br />What nobody seems to put in these reviews is whether the movie on whatever form of DVD is, the great quality of the  picture & sound, what the extras (if any) are, if the dvd is Region Locked or Region Free ect.<br />Those are the reviews that would be helpful from people for me & millions of other readers looking to buy these dvd's.<br />It would also help if Amazon gave more of this info in their descriptions of the releases that they are selling, which in my view is all ways sorely lacking.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|I am giving the book 4 stars as it was a relatively easy read and kept my interest the entire story.  It won't be the best book you've ever read but it is a very good story with some interesting twists.  The author does an excellent job developing characters.  The author's most skillful accomplishment is the way he is able to develop conflict between the main characters.  A great book for poolside during the summer or something to fill the time while traveling.
B00845PT18|4.0|It's simple.<br /><br />Do you like the Carpenters listening, jelly bean popping, simple, silly Johnny Blaze? Did you really like GR 1? (This does not match the comic version of Ghost Rider). You will not like (probably) GR 2.<br /><br />Do you like the hard, gritty, tortured Ghost Rider from the comics? Then GR 2 is for you!<br /><br />I hated Johnny Blaze in the first movie because he did not match the comic at all. GR 2 is a reboot, to a more comic book like, Johnny Blaze, and I was excited to see the real Ghost Rider come out. Now, if only Marvel had the stones to make a R rated GR...maybe for 3? The Marvel Knights series is a mature comic line and it just can't be done right at PG-13. I do think, however, that the time has come, and the audience exsists, for the gritty R rated comic book movie. Here's hoping!<br /><br />I do have to add that they should pick a new Ghost Rider for their re-boot. Nick Cage is eyeball rolling cliche and quite ridiculous. If it were any actor other than he who performed like he does in GR2 he would have been called an amateur. They found the perfect Hulk for the Avengers after 3 tries, maybe they can find the right Johnny Blaze.
B00127RAJY|2.0|I repeat: If you have bad knees, stay away from this video and any other that has you do side-lunges.  I loved parts of this video, but due to my bad joints was unable to do about a third of the exersizes in it.  Look for workouts that are specifically \\"Low Impact\\".  There are many great ones out there!<br /><br />It also really bothers me that she seems to chastize people for doing modifications.  I'm sorry but I can't afford knee surgery right now but I'd like to get fit so I *can't* do things like jumping jacks, side lunges, and other plyometric excercizes that are painful and damaging to my knees.  That really turned me off to her as a trainer.  If she's a real \\"fitness expert\\" she would know that some people *need* modifications and not try and make it seem like those who do are just lazy slackers.<br /><br />If you too got this DVD and find yourself selling it, try any of Cathe Friedrick's \\"Low Impact\\" DVDs- they are very challenging (I sweat like crazy!), low-impact, fun, and you will see results without someone judging you about needing low impact workouts!

0465092764|2.0|Don't believe the marketing hype. This book is too technical and difficult for the general reader.<br /><br />The only thing I understood was the (admittedly funny) anecdotes about penguin diagrams, Italian mobsters and Joe Hagelin's pink papers. (Peter, please send me that TM poster!) And yes, the author is insulted by two weird French guys confusing Latvia with Lithuania.<br /><br />I also understood that questioning \\"string theory\\" can be, shall we say, a wee bit controversial. Apparently, one string theorist believes that critics should be handled like al-Qaeda and bombed by the American army!<br /><br />By *why* is critique of string theory so controversial? And what on earth *is* string theory, in the first place? If your math is lousy (like mine -I understand addition and subtraction pertaining to my monthly salary, and even that just barely), you won't be able to gauge the answer from \\"Not even wrong\\".<br /><br />I suppose this is how Peter Woit's college lectures for undergraduates sound like: a lot of advanced math with a couple of bizarre anecdotes thrown in to lighten up the proceedings. Nothing wrong with that, if you are the star student, but the rest of us prefer Lee Smolin's \\"The trouble with physics\\". And that book, too, is very difficult! However, if forced to choose, I'd rather try to digest Smolin than Woit.<br /><br />Now, concerning that TM poster, my address is...<br /><br />;-)
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|Ridley Scott has certainly directed some great films, but this one is wretched.  The visuals are interesting, but the plot is confused, the screenplay is terrible, the acting is mediocre, and it's full of holes both in the plot and in the overall conceptualization of the story.  It's like a series of science fiction movie cliches strung together almost randomly.  The occasional allusions to issues of human origins and meaning do not add anything, they just make it sillier.  The best way to watch it would be to turn the sound off and enjoy the set designs.

1594744769|1.0|X-MEN.<br />I was overjoyed when I received this book as a gift, and very excited to begin. The pictures were crazy-creepy, the beginning original and engaging. I fully expected to be taken on a dark and unusual ride when our hero sails to the murky island of his late grandfather's mysterious childhood - and when he reaches the collapsing ruins of the house itself with the overgrown shrubbery and trunk full of lost photographs of the bizarre, creepy children and organs in jars - I thought, wow this is gonna be good...<br /><br />and then, exactly halfway through the book I was pushed headfirst into a story that I've seen in the theaters, an all-too-familiar done-to-death major picture. But instead of a bald gentleman in a wheelchair running a secret school where mutant children can be shielded from the world from people that are afraid of their kind and where their superpowers can be controlled, we have a birdlike older woman running a secret school where mutant children can be shielded form the world from people that are afraid of their kind and where their superpowers can be controlled - well, you get the point.<br /><br />I understand that not every work can be fully original in this day in age. Authors and wannabe authors, screenwriters and song writers have pretty much tackled every subject imaginable...I do not believe that something can really be completely original. My main problem with Mr. Riggs is he did not every try to aim a little higher than what has already been done about a million times. Rather than really explore the potential that his \\"peculiar children' can have, he very lazily took a page from someone else's book (literally) and ran with it. These children are not peculiar at all...we have already seen these children in other movies and in other books, we have already seen the girl who can fly and the invisible boy. The female interest, a young lady - who attends the school, has the spine-chilling, unusual, shocking power of....fire? Fire. As in, firepower from her hands. How in any way does this run parallel with the overall creepy feel of the book? How is SHE qualified, with such a deadly, controlled gift of fire shooting from her hands, to be shielded from the world at this school? She isn't - but Riggs obviously does not think the female interest would be worth the hero's time if she had a damning mutant trait - one that was disturbing to look at or frightening to accept. Obviously Riggs felt a butt-kicking girl with firepower is hot enough for our dear hero.<br /><br />Riggs shatters everything he built up by lazily taking on what has been done before and trying to pass it on as his own. And too bad - it worked - this book is a huge best seller, and once again, a new writer has ridden the coattails to victory on a book that isn't really theirs.
B000E1YVZU|3.0|I love RENT beyond a reasonable point. I've seen the Closing cast, and saw the revival while it was still in previews in 2011. So of course, I had to buy this (and come on. Idina Menzel, Anthony Rapp, and Adam Pascal?!) What's not to love? Well, several things. They took about a few key parts which made the movie lack some depth, while adding parts that weren't seen in the musical. The part that I found most disappointing were the voicemails being spoken instead of sang... Although, technically it makes more sense that, but I feel as though the singing brought some quirkiness to Mark's parents which I loved. The technical problem I had with the DVD was that I'm not able to turn off subtitles which is fairly annoying seeing as I already know the show line for line. So honestly, but the Filmed Live On Broadway version (no original cast, but Eden Espinosa, Adam Kantar, and Will Chase do a pretty good job too), I guarentee you will like that version more, but if you happen to have some spare money and want to watch it for the sake of watching it like I did, it's worth the $10....

0307730697|5.0|Adam Brown, the subject of this book, is a man whose story definitely deserved to be told. His life should be an inspiration to all of us to never give up. He made it into the Navy Seals and stayed there despite many setbacks and handicaps. His family and his faith helped him turn his life around and he ended up dying  a hero instead of in a dirty alley somewhere, which could have been his fate at an earlier time in his life. His example makes it clear there are difficult choices to be made in life and we are responsible for the choices we make. This is a must read for all who need an inspiration to keep going and for any who are interested in our military and the tough job they do. Actually, I'd say it is a must read for everybody!<br /><br />I have read all of Eric Blehm's other books and have enjoyed every one. I considered him a great biographer  before this book came out. This book only confirmed my earlier impression. Eric does a great job of conveying the subject's personality, quirks, likes, dislikes, and always keeps the story interesting. He researches his subject matter thoroughly so he knows how to describe the subject's profession, even though it is not one Eric himself has ever done.
1401937519|5.0|Immediately Anita's story touched me because she talks about things we can all relate to such as not feeling as though we fit in, wanting to please our parents/society/teachers etc., fearing death/cancer/treatment.  You feel as though you're listening to a friend.  When she decides to let go on February 2, 2006, you understand her struggles and want her to have peace.<br /><br />The rest of the book details her near death experience with great clarity including the lessons she's learned. In Part 3 - What I Learned From My Experience - Anita then becomes your teacher and guide.  Her lessons are simple, but profound.<br /><br />What I learned most from Anita was we have a choice.  We can choose to create fear for ourselves or live in joy.  To live our lives fearlessly means to live in joy and happiness.<br /><br />I'll be re-reading this book several times to learn from Anita.  I know right now I've only scratched the surface.<br /><br />I did receive the book free from Hay House in exchange for writing a review, and I'm happy to do so.  I encourage all to read Anita's story.

After so much death and atrocities in this volume, I was surprised that it kind of ended happily.<br /><br />There isn't much else I can say. I'm pretty disappointed because it started so good. It was so real, it brought light to the horrible world slaves had to endure, so it doesn't do it justice if it cannot stay strong throughout all its pages.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I heard alot of people talking about this show and finally had to check it out. Watched the whole season in a week. Cant wait for next season.
B005POK858|5.0|A great RPG indeed I love the story and the graphics. The characters are cool and the items are even better. I really had trouble playing at first but it taught me patience and precision.
B007FH9GT2|4.0|I won't compare this to the Swedish subtitled versions because I think they are all good.  I have read the whole series and then watched the swedish subtitled version.  Then I watched the American version (This one).  Then I went back and watched the 6 part swedish extened version with sub titles.  The story is exceptional and maybe because I had read the books even better.  I would reccomend reading or listening to the books first so you get all the details the first time through.  All three episodes are available in audio books and swedish subtitled video.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I thought I might be to old(30-someting)to read this book. But for the kindle price of $2.99 I gave it a try.  I felt kind of ridicules because like the characters in this book I also have a daughter going to college who is the same age as the main character. But I keep on reading and found myself unable to put the book down.  Its about 2 young adults in a relationship with a lot of breakup and makeup, and finding out if they are right for eachother.  And for the record this is nothing like 50 Shades! Except its a romance and the characters are college students.  Don't be expecting any steamy sex scenes like 50 Shades.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|after buying this game, the kindle wouldn't allow me to download it. errors pop up after about half a second during each download
B001JEPVDM|5.0|Shake Hands with the Devil is a revelation to everyone that life does have a price. If the Rwandan people had a natural resource, other countries wanted almost 1 million innocent people would not have died in 100 days. This tragedy could have been prevented if the international community at the political will to prevent it. Awesome book it is a great read.

0425263908|5.0|Smart, fun and very hot. Eva, the lead female character in this book, is extremely appealing, well-developed (no pun intended) and can hold her own. Gideon, the lead male character is...well, let's just say I'd have a rough time deciding between him and Christian should one of my new favorite literary fantasies ever come to life! Set aside some more 'me' time, you're gonna need it...enjoy!
0307987647|5.0|\\"A Clash of Kings,\\" when read by Roy Dotrice, is a great yarn of a book, continuing the saga of the world of Westeros and its environs. As a 969-page book (Bantam Books paperback), the second book of the Game of Thrones series has enough space to be exciting but also to occasionally trudge through slower scenes. None of this matters however, when the tale is read by the magnificent voice--voices, rather--of Roy Dotrice. For anyone with a significant work commute and an obsessive passion for reading, audio recordings are a great way to knock out those books that have waited so long on the to-do list.<br /><br />Nowhere is this better exemplified than with the masterpiece Roy Dotrice has put forth in recording his reading of \\"A Clash of Kings.\\" He keeps the listener interested through all 30 CDs as he brings the voices of such varied characters as Melisandre, Stannis Baratheon's dark sorceress, Yoren of the Night's Watch, Varys the Spider and Chataya the brothel keeper to rich life. Every character gets his or her own voice. For Catelyn Stark's sorrowful scenes, Dotrice's reading evokes the emotions the character is feeling. For battle scenes, he reads in a passionate voice that cannot help but to put the listener on edge, waiting for every next word where mighty ships slam into each other and brutal combat ensues.<br /><br />In between, his gravelly voice keeps the listener engaged and he rouses an interest that will hang on every next spoken word. Roy Dotrice has taken \\"A Clash of Kings\\" and turned this tale into high theater.
0439023521|5.0|This is the best book I have read in a long time!  I couldn't put it down, I had to know what happened next.  Definitely glad I waited until all 3 books were published to start this trilogy, because I finished it in 3 days there's no way I would have been able to stretch the suspense over a couple years.  Quick easy read, thoroughly enjoyed.  Don't be the only one that hasn't read The Hunger Games- order the book!
B00881VLCE|5.0|This app is wonderful. its great for long car rides or waits. you can do this puzzle as you do a regular puzzle. my kid brother who is ten loves this game and is always asking to play on it. it is beautiful on my kindle fire.
0547569653|5.0|This is an amazing book because it is about an amazing person. Not much more can be said that hasn't already been said in other reviews. However, Scott has a way of speaking to the reader. He does so with words of inspiration and an urge for us to find our own passion in life.<br />Also, if you've ever met him, you'll know that he is an incredibly humble guy. He came to Seattle last week for a book signing, and to run with a group of us. Whoever wanted to run, ran along with Scott. He was at the bookstore before the run and book signing even started, talking with people and taking pictures. After the run he took more photos, before heading over to the bookstore for a presentation/Q&A session and book signing. Scott had positive words for each person he met.
B006P96PAO|5.0|Wow, what a great movie. It shows that life is short and as men, we can have a great impact for good or evil in the lives of our wives and children. Inspiring!
0375842209|1.0|This book was so boring and so paced.  It is the first book I have started and didn't finish.  I managed to get 50 pages from the end and couldn't take another second of this.  I hate the way \\"Death\\" narrates, he is beyond annoying!  This book just drags on forever.  Honestly, I don't understand the hype.  Really, really bad!

B007UWBGVS|5.0|With each delay and reviews coming in from those that heard some of the tracks from Trespassing, my anticipation and impatience grew stronger. Finally, on May 15th Trespassing was released. I kept thinking it would never measure up to all my expectations, but it has far exceeded those expectations. Each song is an experience to be repeated over and over. I never tire. The light side with Trespassing, Cuckoo, Shady, Pop That Lock, Kickin In among them have a funky, groovy feel with a great Rock, electro sound and the lyrics make you feel alive and empowered. Adam has taken pop from the past and blended with today and come up with a sound that is totally amazing. It is so superior than anything on radio today!! Who can sit still and not want to dance, groove and sing to these songs. The dark side just sends me over the edge and songs like Underneath and Outlaws of Love tear my soul to shreds. The dark side holds ballads that make you feel and relate and are what ballads should be, but are never heard today, with the exception of Adele. Chokehold, Better Than I know Myself and Broken English (Oh God Those Vocals) are out of this world, but what is really the shocker is the bonus tracks. They blow my mind. RUNNIN and Take Back are absolutely unbelievable. Both songs I so relate to and find myself hitting the repeat button over and over and singing along with Adam with such emotion. Vocals are stunning on both, but Nirvana's vocals are to die for. What a beautiful lullaby!!! Trespassing has everything and I mean everything you could ever want from an album. I will never tire of it. How could you when each song is distinct in creativity and so fulfilling. Thank you Adam for letting us get Underneath and for letting us Trespass into your life!! Underneath is a song that will haunt me forever and Trespassing, the song, should win awards!! Best Album I have heard in years!!
B0077SGMXM|5.0|My dad and I love to play games together. This game......perfect! We played and laughed because of how easy and hard each hole got. Get it! It's free for only today!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book tortured me...because there really is no good \\"stopping point\\", which meant that the times that I read it at work and my breaks ended I was left hanging on the edge of some new, always startling discovery or plot twist. I ended up staying up all night finishing the last 45% of the book. The effect/enjoyment of reading Gone Girl is absolutely impossible to explain. While it was one of the most twisted and disturbing stories that I have ever read, it also felt very real, very believable, very \\"oh my god, this is such a dose of relationship reality and that is scary!\\" Gillian Flynn's portrayal of the Dunne's marriage and the decline thereof is strikingly realistic while also being out of this world nuts. I did guess partway through what had actually happened to Amy, but it had no effect whatsoever on the enjoyment I got out of the rest of the story, and there were so many elements that I could never in a million years have guessed that completely made up for that tiny bit of letdown. This book is utterly absorbing, thrilling and absolutely BRILLIANT! What I wouldn't give to see into Gillian Flynn's mind..and then get back out quickly!

0385523912|5.0|Before purchasing this book, I knew very little about the North Korean people.  This book reads like a novel - I found it hard to put down.  Demick follows the story of a few North Korean defectors and paints the story of their lives. In addition to showcasing the hard lives many North Koreans lead, the book explores emotions that we all have felt such as love, guilt, betrayal, loyalty, and friendship. The book does this by going in great detail about a few North Korean's personal lives. Those featured in the book are very different from each other - from a girl whose father was a South Korean prisoner of war, to a well-off woman who felt undying loyalty to North Korea, Kim Il-Sung, and Kim Jong-Il, to a young man attending one of the universities in Pyongyang.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn about the plight of the North Korean people.  If you are looking for hard facts, statistics, and the like this is not the book for you - though a bit of history is explored to give context, the main focus of the book is the ordinary lives of the people.  It was exactly what I was looking for - insight into the lives in a society that has been cut off from the rest of the world.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I liv this app its works so well and all my little cousins love playing with all the colors I would recommend this people with little children

B006NYDV7Q|3.0|When I first heard that \\"Weather Report: The Columbia Albums 1976-1982\\" and it's companion box set, \\"Weather Report: The Columbia Albums 1971-1975\\", had been recently remastered I expected the sound to be nothing less than breath-taking as they were mastered by Mark Wilder, who had done the DSD Mastering for the 2007 Japan HQD mini-LP editions of the Weather Report catalog.<br /><br />From the PolkAudio Forum, [...], \\"HQCD (HiQualityCD) format achieves high quality audio through the use of a polycarbonate plastic with improved transparency derived from LCD display manufacturing technologies enabling more accurate reading of the CD data. In addition, a special alloy is used as the material of the reflective layer instead of the standard aluminum. HQCD format CDs are fully compatible with standard CD players.\\"<br /><br />I have copies of the DSD-HQD versions of Black Market and Mysterious Traveller and they sound fantastic and expected the new Columbia Albums box set to be the equal or better of the these discs especially as the Columbia/Legacy editions of Black Market and Heavy Weather were great.<br /><br />Well, sonically, the \\"Weather Report: The Columbia Albums 1976-1982\\" set is good and a bargain at the price, but the dynamic range and clarity of the DSD-HQD versions would have enhaced this set even at a higher price.<br /><br />A major problem I have with this set is the packaging which is decidedly low end.  The clam-shell box is dull and uninspired and Legacy's attempt at the individulal CD's mini-LP covers are poorly constructed with poor color reproduction.  The booklet is black and white except for a dull color front and contains only a page and a half of notes and track and recording notes that could have been incorporated into gate-fold (higher production value) mini-LP covers.<br /><br />If you don't own any of these on CD this box set is a great bargain while we wait for Sony-Columbia/Legacy to give them first tier treatment along the lines of the Miles Davis box sets.
B004FOA84A|3.0|This was just okay in my book.  Try The Mystery of the Crimson Manor, it is so much better and the same price!
B0077SGMXM|1.0|Simple problem: it's not normally $2.99, it's free at the Google Play. So Amazon gave incorrect information, and you're better off getting the exact same ad-free version from the Android Market where updates are actually timely.
B007SGM084|5.0|The hype made me curious but the books made me a fan. Buying the trilogy was definitely the way to go because you can't stop at the first one, you have to read all three. The layout of all three books were easy to navigate in my Kindle and they flowed from one book into the next without having to click on a new book in my library. Best book purchase from Amazon yet!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This game is simply a bunch of little games roled into one. It is exactly what you would expect and nothing special.

B003TOSZSS|5.0|I missed this the first time around and also on the reruns which are showing on the local stations. So I bought it here. Frankly, the show had lost a lot of the old magic and they were just putting something out there. It was enjoyable, but the old betty eps were better.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love being able to follow sermon notes on my phone and listen to the Word in the car through my stereo.
B002AF4Y96|4.0|I give it four stars instead of five stars, it's maybe because I already watch it or my opinion was changed as I get older. I first watched it when I was younger, I thought it was so cool. Many years later, today, I watched it, I had a second opinion that it wasn't super cool after all. Though, it's still cool. It's somewhat like a motion version of collages. Pretty messy. The best part is how they do in a home with an abusive father and neutral mother and how they interact with American Natives at a reservation. Prison riots are pretty cool.
0307730697|5.0|Tells the story of Adam Brown, an American Hero of the truest form. From the start of the book, we see the ups and the downs of the inside life of a SEAL team operator, one that ends tragically too soon on a daring, dangerous mission.

B0018QQQK8|4.0|This is the second book I have read by Nicholas Sparks, and I have loved them both. I don't normally read books like this so I don't ever know if I will enjoy them when I do, but this book did not disappoint. We decided to read this as a group read because of the movie coming out. I can say that I may not have read it otherwise, but I am really glad that I did.<br /><br />The main character is Logan Thibault. He is a former Marine who served more than his fair share in the war. He finds a picture in the sand one morning and posts it on a board thinking that someone will claim it, but no one does. He decides to take it back and carries it with him everywhere. His friend Victor tells him that it is his good luck charm, but he doesn't believe in that type of stuff. He begins to wonder though when he lives through ordeals that others don't. His fellow soldiers start looking at him like he made a deal with the devil. Once out and back home in Colorado he struggles to get past it all. Victor tells him that he must find the woman in the picture, that he owes her. One day he just starts walking and ends up in North Carolina. There he finds her and their lives both change.<br /><br />This book is not overly exciting or suspenseful, but it is good. It is a nice love story. The whole story is interesting. I will say that there are parts that are very sad and there are parts that will have you on the edge of your seat. I really enjoyed this book and I actually want to watch the movie now.
B004V4H55Y|4.0|This is a good example of an early mystery novel.  Not typical of today's mysteries, but historically it is important and influenced many later writers.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|I found the story to be quite entertaining; the writing was quite good and drew the reader in at once.  The background facts appear to be true, and provide information as well as a rich backdrop for the characters.  I would recommend it!

B0088P2A7A|3.0|This app just has Wikipedia's main page article and current news. I like to check Wikipedia for &quot;This Date In History&quot;, the  listings of who was born and who died today, and &quot;Did You Know&quot; sections, which are not here as they are on the Web site.  I'd give five stars if they add those features.
B00845PV16|1.0|Well, the first one was pretty good and had a solid story line. This one, however, didn't take any of the first movies good content and put it to use in this one. The ghost rider is completely different (worse in my opinion) and the dialog is pretty lame. It has a natural born killers theme to it when he changes. Boy did they mess this one up...had lots of potential too.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|No great literary work, but quite entertaining.  I laughed out loud a couple of times, and found the characters endearing.  It was well written and \\"cute\\".. I read the entire trilogy and would read more.
0345803485|2.0|I felt the plot line was not developed enough for me and the female main character was too backward, not innocent, just stupid.  I finished the first book, but was left hanging. Why was there no wrap-up, was that done to entice me to buy the next two books?  Don't think so.
B000SEIDR0|1.0|Omnivore's Dilemma covers a really interesting and vital part of our lives - the meal (or more of a corn part of it). His observations are brilliant and oftentimes supremely informative. Yet, the author tends to dive into way too much detail about the chemical processes and all sorts of stuff like that...the book simply turns into one of those boring chemistry classes... Interesting subject, I hope to find something better on it.<br /><br />Have fun,<br />E

B00466HM28|4.0|I love this product cause its plug and play. Also its very portable. The only negative things i can say is (1. that the pads are kind of tuff 2.The keys are kind of small and not lightweight as they say on the box. Besides that its cool and good to go. I use it right now while im deployed and its nice. I mean with lil space anyway at least there is no excuse for not keeping my hobby going and making a couple dollars.

B007L96SI6|5.0|This CD is excellent!  And I didn't watch Idol.  I happen to be hearing \\"Free\\" on Internet Radio and liked it so much I bought the CD.  The first song on the CD \\"Oh My\\".. unbelieveably good, it should be on radio.  \\"Wasted Tears\\", and \\"Hit the Ground Running\\" should be playing on top 40 Radio.  They have great hooks, and a good vibe to all the songs.  All the British Acts now coming over with that kinda 1960's retro sound, Haley fits right in.  It's a shame we have such poor Radio Music Directors that are no longer playing the Idols anymore.  It only appears that Country Music Radio is giving them a chance.  Haley Reinhart has a perfect image, and the songs on this CD are great.  The only thing I would suggest to the PR management team is stop selling her as a sex kitten.  She should be promoted like Kelly Clarkson.  She has an edgy and confident attitude but is also very sweet and that is the image that should be promoted.  She is a smart girl.  I highly recommend fans who enjoy Adele, and the Amy Winehouse sound to buy this CD.  You won't be disappointed.  Cool voice and a different sound.  Request radio to play her because she should be heard.  I rate this CD an A and would consider this a Grammy Award recommendation for the New Artist Category - it's that good and I have never once been wrong.  These artist need to be heard.
B00773YOB4|5.0|Need I say more? Since they require a minimum of twenty words, I guess I have to. This has quickly become one of my favorite from among my nearly complete set of her work.

It seems he is trying to stretch things out - maybe to make the TV series last longer?? The book is still worth the read, hope the next one is better.
B004LWZW42|5.0|This movie was a real treat to watch.  I enjoyed every moment of it.  Throughout the other X-Men movies, there was always a connection between Xavier and Eric.  I now truly understand their relationship and how they became good friends and sadly going their separate ways.  Though in the other movies, they always had a respect and fondness for one another.  There were other characters that I don't remember hearing about, but worked well in the picture.<br /><br />The acting was good as well.  Kevin Bacon was a really good bad guy.  His character was believable and well acted.  I enjoyed James McAvoy very much as Xavier.  Michael Fassbender was wonderful as Magneto, if I'am spelling it correctly.  I don't remember seeing the character Jean.  Maybe she will surface in an upcoming sequel, if one will be made.<br /><br />The action was not over done, which made the movie flow rather well for me.  There were some really good scenes.  This movie kept my attention throughout.  I have watched it since then, several times and have not grown tired of it as of now.  I feel this movie will be one of my favorites for a long time to come.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This cover is great.  It is was a little more expensive than I would have liked, but it has proven itself.  It has made multiple underways on a submarine and has withstood a great deal of abuse.  5-stars!
B007Z9QS5K|5.0|Great Movie.. Must see! It has so many actors in it, and ones that just pop in here and there. It's a great girls nght flick, or date night movie. Who doesnt love SJP (Sarah Jessica Parker)and Michelle Pfeiffer? Add some Ashton Kutcher and Zac Efron, then no one can tear me from the sofa! Bring on the popcorn and Charleston Chews...
0452289963|5.0|There are many personal development books that I have read.  However, this book has transformed me more than all of those books put together.  One that you will want to share and listen to many times.  Pass this one along!!

0345522303|5.0|The latest Nightrunner book, Casket of Souls, by Lynn Flewelling is one of my favorites of the series so far. For one, and the biggest, neither main character got kidnapped. That was getting so old. I loved how we got to see them work in the city, in their actual environment. It was great seeing a new contact/nigthrunner get coutred, even if it didn't work out. And seeing some of the suplimental characters developed more was well done, Thero really came into his role. And she had no problem killing off established characters. Great book!

B005LAIGW8|2.0|This movie was nowhere near as good as the first. What's up with the greasy leather suit. Where's the awesome chopper with the chain forks and skull on the handlebars? I don't know new bike styles but this is essentually an 89 honda VMax that doesn't even change, it's just on fire. BOOOOOO!  The soul stare is not as cool as the first and when he does it, it takes forever!!! I guess he has better control of his power now becuase he can be the rider in direct sunlight. Nicolas Cage is such a bad actor. Yes he has some high making movies but all those movies make him...not the other way around. Still the same charater as all his other movies....to bad he can't come up with something new like Blue Steal! lol The only redeming quality to this movie is he can transform whatever he's driving into a flame vehicle...including giant trench diggers! which was pretty cool. The movie wasn't even funny...didn't even have any cheesy 1 liners(maybe 1)! The rider kills the bad guy Ray but the devil brings him back to life and gives him the power of decay. Now everything he touchs decayes, except a twinkie which has probably been done in 1000 movies. The fight scenes the characters are transported back and forth between what seems to be like a 12th dimension. This to me was just stupid!<br /><br />I love the Rider but as with any book, comic, whatever...I don't care if it stays 100% true to those as long as it is good, has good acting, fun to see, or has a decent plot....This movie has none of that!<br /><br />Anyway if it weren't for the fact that my 7 year old son loved it. I'd give it 1 star. He even thinks the skull looks like a monkey!! Don't buy rent!

0143038419|1.0|They sell! People recommend them. Gilbert is here on target. She is a NOW WRITER. She fills the expectations of a fast read tackling current \\"Inside Edition\\"-similar info on affluent modern women's woes. But her road to finding herself is painful,redundant and finally kitsch-like. A pity, since she is talented.  Before her search to find herself she should have put the bestselling philosopher David Precht in her purse. Reading encouraging Amazon reviews, I may, however, give her previous book \\"An American Man\\" a chance.

B00002MZ4W|4.0|Fiona Apple's sophomore album is darker, more mature, and more percussive than her debut TIDAL.  WHEN THE PAWN... (the album is a rebuttal to a critic's negative review of TIDAL,) is a 10-song collection that shows Apple developing herself as a creative songwriter.  This album feels like Apple striking out, refusing to be pigeonholed into a career of rewriting \\"Criminal\\" for radioplay.  Replacing some of the radio-friendly melodies of the debut album, WHEN THE PAWN... is a slow-burn; maximum enjoyment comes after a few initial plays.<br /><br />The album begins with \\"On the Bound,\\" a jazzy, melancholic ballad that finds Apple repeating the refrain \\"You're all I need...\\"  The song sets the tone for the album: she's angry, melancholic, and as sharp as ever.  Her piano lurches throughout the song.  With a strong, soulful voice, Apple stands above many other female singers in the music industry.  Her voice soars over much of the record, at times overpowering any piano or drums that may be in her way.  There's a certain confidence and anger here that wasn't present on past recordings.  Where TIDAL was more piano-driven, WHEN THE PAWN... focuses less on the keys and more on percussion (particularly the drumkit).  The record ends with the bittersweet \\"I Know,\\" a love song that is strengthened not by what Apple adds, but what she leaves out.  This album works as a whole better than TIDAL, and it forecasts the creative shifts Apple would take in EXTRAORDINARY MACHINE and THE IDLER WHEEL...<br /><br />Fans of Apple's discography, Tori Amos, or Alanis Morissette will find a lot of material here to love.  Standout tracks to sample: \\"Fast as You Can,\\" \\"To Your Love\\" and \\"Limp.\\"  These songs would also be a good indication of what the album as a whole sounds like.  WHEN THE PAWN... is a worthy follow up to her initial debut, and it solidified Apple has a fantastic artistic force.<br /><br />OF NOTE:  There is another listing for WHEN THE PAWN on Amazon.  At the moment of posting, it seems to be cheaper (CD only).  You can check it out here:  [[ASIN:B005F9TPZ2 When the Pawn]].it seems to be cheaper (CD only).

B0077SGMXM|5.0|this game is addictive and a good time passer. its also very easy even for ppl who don't play golf. and hey its free so give it a chance!!!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|i love this game. for those whose kids are buying coins, either dont let them play or make sure they know not to. all free apps have things you can buy, therefore they are able yo make something.. not fair to the creators that you gave a bad review because you don't control your children. also to those that cannot get out without shutting off the kindle, use your brain, hit options and what do you know the bar magically reappears. give me a break people. its a great free game to waste time with.

B007C7UZIG|1.0|After dealing with consistent software crashes with 2 of the 15 games which I purchased, I contacted Valve support - which is actually non-existent/unresponsive.  After 3 months and 11 emails, I lost my temper and demanded a refund - to which not only did they ban me from my account (which blocks access to the $221 worth of games I had purchased through its interface) but they refused to give me a refund.  Still no response to this very day.  These people are shady - and are questionable in their business ethics. I highly recommend using legitimate routes of video game purchasing - these guys will steal from you.  I have well documented proof of that to anyone who would like to see it.

0312360258|4.0|Why read: Heard great things about the series<br /><br />What impressed me: I really enjoyed the set up of how vampires become vampires in Marked. Instead of it being immediate, the Change takes years, all the while those who may become vampires are in danger of dying because their Change went wrong. I loved the House of Night, the school where those who are in the process of Changing learn about what they are to become. Zoey is a great character, as are her friends, and I can't wait to read more about them.<br /><br />What disappointed me: I thought the inclusion of Nix as the almighty vampyre goddess was a little more than the book needed. It added a higher mystical power that I felt wasn't quite necessary and may be used in future books as an easy way out of situations.<br /><br />Recommended: Yes. Marked sets the stage for a great YA vampire series.<br /><br />Continue series: Absolutely. I have a lot of catching up to do.
B006L4MWVE|5.0|This is probably the most thought provoking movie that has been released into the States from Japan yet, it gives a real moral question on personal survival against the bonds of friends and loved ones.  The movie has us shown in the fictional near future of Japan with a near bankrupt economy and for some reason have mad a law called Battle Royale where a group of high school students picked at random or forced to fight each other until there is only one survivor who has the \\"Honor\\" of coming back to Japan and becoming a helpful citizen to their country.  Many of the actors and actresses pulled off their roles with great realism as you can't help but wonder what you would do in that situation.Could you kill your best friend?, you girlfriend?, your boyfriend just to stay alive.  The movie shows us all these angst thoughts and choices the students make in this horrendous situation.  Some will kill,others will unite to escape,and others lose hope.  The emotional acting from the cast was great and you can't help but empathize with their plight, as you watch the movie you feel some choices were right some wrong but in all the choices are made for good or bad.  The video quality is nice and clear and the audio is sharp so no complaints on either part.  This is definitely not a movie for young children and I would also advise with teens under 16 until the parent watches the movie first to make sure if their children can handle the scenario in the movie.  So a great movie with a great cast and story are here for you to enjoy regardless and at a very affordable price as well....<br /><br />Update 06-20-2012<br /><br />Some friends and others were wondering if this version comes with a dubbed English audio,  while you do get a dubbed cast more then 70% of them were just atrocious while doing their lines.  This is one movie that would have been better just being subbed because if you can't get a halfway decent dubbed voice cast then all you're going to leave people watching the movie with is a headache and annoyance..movie with is a headache and annoyance..

B004SCN2F6|5.0|I picked this game up for £1.25 and haven't put it down since.<br /><br />The game is described as 'complex', however, it is not so complex that it is difficult to get into. Character creation is straightforward and takes a minute at the most. You choose a starting profession, a spacecraft and a faction - be it a Great House or a Syndicate. You're then launched into a Science Fiction reference rich world in which your actions do not happen in a vacuum. There is a play style for everyone, for example, you may decide to play as a pirate preying on merchant fleets, a military officer performing missions for their faction or as an explorer discovering forgotten relics on wild worlds.<br /><br />The graphics may not be the best out there but they do enough to get the imagination going. Combine this with the minimal descriptive text and you have a world that it is possible to lose yourself in for a few hours - or at least until your phone runs out of charge...

How does anyone get past the<br />fact that the writer is constantly writing the same thing OVER AND OVER? \\"er......her cheeks are always blushing, her lip is being chewed on 24/7, she's constantly whispering,and don't forget that if the wind even blows her way she has multiple<br />orgasms!.. The way the sex was described is a complete joke, and SIR GRAY lasts like 3 minutes, tops, and in that time Ana<br />is able to have 239 orgasms?..And WHY must so much writing go into her putting her hair up in ponytails???

B005LAIH2W|4.0|Don't be scared away by those who've read the books and didn't think the movie followed them well enough. Ask yourself if you'd want to see the movie even if you didn't know it was based on the Burroughs series. If yes, you'll probably enjoy it. I did.<br /><br />Others have given plot summaries. All I want to add (without giving anything away) is that I loved the ending.<br /><br />This is a great choice for the whole family for movie night at home. It may even entice the kids into reading the books.
0547258305|5.0|Graceling by Kristin Cashore was an exciting book. I found the characters in Graceling to be interesting and the story captivated my attention. Katsa is graced with killing and is forced to work as her uncle's thug to hurt his enemies. Katsa's uncle is also the king. Being Graced means that a person has exceptional talent in a certain area but will be used by the kings of the seven realms if they will help the king's cause. Katsa encounters a mysterious stranger on a mission she goes on to save someone important to her cause which is to help the kingdom. We soon learn that the stranger is Prince Po who has an unusual Grace. I love that Po is willing to accept that Katsa is a better fighter than him and he accepts all her other oddities. The romance in Graceling develops somewhat slowly and believably.<br />Graceling takes you on an adventure to a place where people are not quite what they seem and a world where you have to be strong to survive. There are some adult issues in this book but I think it is appropriate for older teens. I would recommend this book to fantasy fans and readers who like a strong heroine.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|The first book got me hooked and seceond book continues to do so.  Even though fiction it contains many of life's tragic episodes.  Ender for some reason reminds me of an ultra moderm<br />Alexander the Great.  Taking what he has learned from conquest and using that to have a better understanding of aliens,customs,behaviors of other worlds.  Because he is tolerant, hopefully others will follow suit. Show us the way Ender!!

B007L6VR12|5.0|Set in the 1960s, two twelve-years-olds Sam (played by Jared Gilman) and Suzy (played by Kara Hayward) meet and exchange letters that lead to Sam running away from scout camp and Suzy leaving home to meet him. Since the story takes place on an island, they can only hide for so long. The scout master (played by Edward Norton) enlists his scout troop to help him search for Sam and Suzy's family calls in the local island cop (played by Bruce Willis) to look for Suzy. They soon learn that the two are together. As a killer storm approaches the island, friendships and loyalties change.<br /><br />This movie is special. There's humor, budding romance, tension and a great cast. The ending ties up all the loose ends in a practical, satisfying way.
B007ADIRDM|5.0|This set is by far the best of the MH line. It is well constructed and the Amazon price for the doll, hutch, sofa, chair and coffee table with a MH magazine is absolutely unbeatable.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|How they continiue to do it avoids me....they sound vibrant, youthfull, energized, inspired, the quality of their lives certainly reflects in the quality of this album, and its so exciting to hear from the guys again, as you know its a conceptual album and reveals a long story thats well documented in reviews on here, so i wont touch on that but will touch on the mix of the album is fantastic they have really never sounded better, the arrangements are of some of the finest they have ever constructed.And it is to be treasured and appriciated greatly, you never know if this is the last you will hear from them as rush going forward at this point. 5 stars  simply brilliant
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I was turned onto this game by a friend and I am hooked.  I like that it's almost always a challenge regardless of the level.
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|Warning:  lots of spoilers in this.  First, the good:  Visually it looks very good, it is consistent visually with the franchise and the new alien worlds look cool & creepy.  Most of the acting is good, Michael Fassbender is particularly good in his role.  The Bad:  The actors don't have a whole heck of a lot to work with.  Most of the \\"philosophy\\" and \\"concept\\" of this movie is a watered-down version of themes from 2001: A Space Odyssey and Blade Runner about what it means to be human and how creations (androids) view their creators.  The single biggest problem is that nothing -really- makes any sense when you think about it - and it feels like every scene characters are making decisions that no reasonable person in that situation would make.  It's also a very unintellectual movie - it champions Intelligent Design (Evolution is given lip service but the whole movie is about how humans were intelligently designed), and it is shockingly P.C. (I mean really, is she trying to deliver the alien baby or is she aborting it - if it's an abortion call it an abortion already, calling it a C-section is absurd).  The science is consistently ridiculous - whether it's carbon dating, DNA, surgical machines from the future that were only designed for procedures on males (when half the crew is female) or black goo magic none of it makes any sense.  All the aliens we've already seen before, including the \\"new\\" ones that look like the bad guys from Dark City or Pinhead without the Pins (not very original).  But it's the decisions the characters make that make the least sense, right up to the end where the main character somehow \\"knows\\" that the alien race that had sleepers on a mission to destroy the earth somehow \\"changed\\" its mind.  Is that just wishful thinking?  More likely the aliens thought their sleepers would do the job and had other priorities.  Going there to find out why they changed their mind presupposes that they did change their mind - and I must have missed where in the film she saw something that made her think that.  It surely wasn't the alien that tore her crew apart with his bare hands that suggested they changed their mind.  I think perhaps we're just supposed to look at cool visuals and not expect anything to make any sense.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I almost didn't read the series due to so many negative reviews, but a couple friends urged me to try it anyway. I'm so glad I did! Sure, it's not the most amazing writing, but it has an awesome storyline with great characters and I enjoyed every second of each book.  I have no idea how people could give such negative reviews! For those who say its unbelievable, who cares?! Escape reality for a few minutes and pretend attractive  billionaires really do fall in love with ordinary women, have crazy good sex way too often, and act like teenagers!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I enjoy this game, its a lot like Mario Bros. the graphics are very crisp and clear. I recommend it, especially for a free game.
B0050R0XEG|3.0|It is amazing, how Lego was able to construct a camper with so many little pieces, so precisly fitting in every way and so exactly like an old camper was.<br />The doors, which can be opened, the table, who can be changed into a bed, the roof who can be opened, it is all amazing.

0385534639|5.0|From the opening page, this novel weaves a gorgeous tale of details and curiosities and suspense and great writing. Each scene unfolds so delicately. Each chapter leads to the next with such ease.<br /><br />At times, paragraphs are pure beauty. Sentences are so lovingly built. It's wonderful to read an author who takes such care to create both a fictional world and a literary construct which match so perfectly. So many times I thought: If only this Circus was true.<br /><br />Yeah, I adored it, for its fun and wit and cleverisms. I don't care if that's not a word. It fits.
B005LAIGSC|4.0|I thought it was pretty good in spite of the ratings giving by professional critics who are usually wrong anyway.  Everyone keeps saying it was predictable then giving it 2 stars.  I would like to see their ratings of top movies like Avatar which were just as, is not more, predictable.  Unfortunately, unimaginative movies are the way of Hollywood, who would dare ask for anything more.
0307887448|3.0|Having grown up in the 80s, I easily connected with all the plot references. If only that meant something.<br /><br />This novel is basically video-game fan fiction. There's really no doubt everything will turn out as expected. There's no surprise at who's good or bad or wins or loses. Most of the conflict takes place virtually, where the loser suffers the fate of losing their on-line character! Oh the horror ... blah.<br /><br />It's an easy read, I suppose. If you long for 80's trivia in novel form (with a little Disney adventure genre thrown), then this might be for you.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|What a complete waste of time and money! The only reason I bought this books was because of all the hype and amazing five star reviews. Don't make the same mistake. I had to FORCE myself to even finish it, and I'm the type that usually can't put a book down (and stays up way too late reading because of this).<br /><br />Please don't believe the idiots who gave this book a 5 star rating - they must be in fourth grade because this is the most poorly written, absurd, non-sexy book I've ever had the misfortune of spending my money on. Seriously, are grown women actually turned on by this drivel? This is the worst writing I've read in a long, long time. There is nothing sexy, fun or semi-believable about this incredibly stupid story.
0812550706|5.0|\\"Ender's Game\\" by Orson Scott Card is a science fiction book, with a terrible crisis of<br />preparing for a third possible attack from an alien race know as the \\"buggers'\\". Earth had been<br />attack twice, after the second attack the government of the world answered back and sent<br />forth a attack fleet towards the home planet of the buggers, to rid them of the buggers' once<br />and for all. The only problem is they have no one to command the fleet! This is where Ender<br />comes in, a child genius allowed to be born by the government because his siblings almost had<br />the correct traits to lead. Ender had to face many enemies in his journey to save the world. He<br />was taken away to be trained at the art of interstellar war and the start of his new life at the<br />age of six.<br /><br /> When the book starts off Ender is introduced to us as the third sibling in his family. The<br />government had strict mandates that two children could be the max for a household. Because<br />he had a brother and sister with qualities suiting of a excellent commander, the government<br />allowed him to be born. He was closely monitored by the government and then taken to be<br />trained at a high tech battle school in space. This school focused on the practice of war<br />techniques in space and also the class work associated with it. Ender quickly became the star of<br />the school and never lost at the game in the school.<br /><br /> Ender had to learn to deal with many enemies throughout the book, his older brother,<br />fights at home, and other children in the school picking on him and starting fights because of his<br />brilliance and success at the battle simulation game. In every encounter Ender is able to defeat<br />his foes which add to those rich life experiences that aid in his victories. Even during the battle<br />simulations when the teachers stack the teams against Ender, he never lost. He used his boy<br />genius qualities and won. By now he thought hisfight was with the teachers and not the other<br />boys, but he did not know the battle fleet was on the brink of the home planet of the buggers'<br />and Ender needed to be pushed in every way possible to be ready for the assault.<br /><br /> Nearing the end of the book, Ender is promoted from the battle school and into the<br />Command school. Here he is to learn to command the ship in battle and there functions. Again<br />he is put to the test in the simulator and push to the edge, after all, he had to train to save the<br />world! Eventually the last simulation he played, was not a test, but the real thing, but he would<br />never know until the battle was over. Kept in the dark with one objective as always, defeat your<br />enemy or he may defeat you.<br /><br /> This book is definitely one of my favorite books I have read. I have read it many times<br />over in my life and always satisfied when finished reading. It is one of those books that you just<br />can't put down until finished reading. Although I have read a few of the other books in the<br />series my interest was eventually lost after a few books, but the first, \\"Ender's Game\\" is<br />definitely worth the read.
B0058ZZDVS|5.0|This show is without a doubt one of the best shows on television! The cast is perfect, the dialogue outstanding and witty, has plenty of giggle moments to lighten the mood a bit. I have never really been into law shows, but this one spends more time looking into what goes on outside of a courtroom. The characters are each unique and have very interesting personalities... great show!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I feel really sorry for all of you readers who scored this lower than a four. First, it's supposed to be a SEVEN book series, so stop your whining about all of the first five books not being action packed. The incredible part of Martin's writing is his depth of plot and characters, so sit down, chill, and realize you have two more books coming to give you your incredible ending. Second, show some patience and realize that these books are apart of one of the greatest series ever and the author has gotten where he is today by NOT BEING PREDICTABLE. Lastly, I would like to say that it is SO refreshing to have an author that takes time to paint such a detailed and downright enthralling picture of a land that could almost be real. Again, I'm so sorry that all of you hate that there is no instant gratification in this book, but have some patience and realize that the work put into this book to make the plot that much more puzzling will make the definite ending all the sweeter.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book! I could not put it down. I was so sad when I finished all 3. I wanted more.

B003TJR2HS|4.0|Item is exactly what was described however i'm not so sure it's made to work with the Lifeproof case for the IPhone. The head fits in well however the flap from the case gets pushed back significantly. I noticed that after using this product, I had to make sure that the seal was clean since the case can open up. As a result of the tight fit from the flap, my music, at times, gets distorted.

0345803485|1.0|This book is from the view of a 22 year old virgin college student. She is needy, annoying, and selfish. This book is not well written and should have a warning that any women over the age of 25 should not read it.
030758836X|5.0|This was one of those rare books that lives up to its billing, I simply could not put it down.  It works at multiple levels, not simply as a suspense/murder mystery, but also as a social commentary, and more importantly a mediation on marriage.  Even those that are in no way like Nick and Amy, but are married, reading it will probably wonder about not only their view of what is going on in their marriage but also how their partner views it.  A smart book that is more than just a pot-boiler.  Read it now before the inevitable movie comes out.
0345803485|5.0|Well written book. Cliffhanger lets the reader wanting more. I found it hard to find a spot I wanted to stop because I just wanted to know what happened next. Adult readers only. Very discriptive.
B0086700CM|5.0|great game on kindle fire, I got this because of the reviews and I have not been disappointed!  I am now totally addicted.
B0001XAPX8|5.0|This is a great movie with great actors. Fantastic plot.Nicole Kidman as always is fantastic and Antony Hopkins is ...well Antony Hopkins. I don't know of any movie that Antony Hopkins didn't perform well.<br />Puts political correctness in perspective. Never assume that you know everything about a person and always stand for what you believe. Our society always want to fix/rehabilitate stupid (the drunk husband) and ignores the real smart people who are there to advance our world. This is a movie with a strong message.
B007PZ6T80|4.0|One of Dolph Lundgren's best starring films (which I know isn't saying a whole lot, but still), Red Scorpion is one of the most overlooked action gems from the 80s.  Lundgren plays a Soviet Special Forces Lieutenant in Africa that turns against his fellow Soviets when he realizes that he's been fighting on the wrong side all along.  That's pretty much it story wise, but what Red Scorpion delivers in terms of direction (by Joseph Zito, who helmed the Chuck Norris action cheese-fests Missing in Action and Invasion USA, as well as horror favorites The Prowler and Friday the 13th Part 4), action sequences, and makeup effects from the great Tom Savini more than makes up for any of its other shortcomings.  Red Scorpion also has the dubious honor of being produced and written by convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff, which in itself makes it worth seeing regardless.  Synapse Films went out of their way to pack enough special features into this Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack (they usually do) as well as beautifully restore the film's picture as well.  All in all, if action movies are your thing, check out Red Scorpion, you'll be glad that you did.
0393088774|5.0|Krugman's book provides a thoughtful and evidence-based analysis of the current state of the economy and what needs to be done about it.<br />He explains why government spending can increase output by replacing private demand without crowding out in the current circumstances, because private spending is down.<br />He also explains why the increase in base money is not going to be inflationary until the economy picks up again and that the base money can be withdrawn easily.<br />Recommended reading.
B005LAIGPA|5.0|An amazing movie. Gave me such an adrenaline rush :) must buy!!! Story line and plot line in this movie is great.
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|Overall it was a pretty good movie. They changed a few things from the book and they didn't explain some things though.
0307951529|5.0|If you've had that idea bouncing around in your head (or maybe it's many ideas), pick up this book and use some of the great practical tips to help find the place where your idea or passion intersects with what people need and are willing to pay for. The real examples in the book resonated with me because I feel like I can relate to these people. It's inspiring to see people start out with a seed of an idea and figure out how to make it work. Chris provides some excellent templates to help think through the steps.<br /><br />I had the great pleasure of meeting Chris during his book tour this year. His enthusiasm about this topic is contagious and he's so down-to-earth and clearly wants to help people find freedom and happiness. Chris is talking about creating Meet Up groups for people starting out with their own ideas. Building these communities of support will be fantastic!
B008764ZQ4|5.0|My husband and I went to see the movie last night and we were both blown away by it! Tom first of all was fabulous in this role. I wondered how he was going to pull this off but my goodness he did! Loved the way the songs blended in the story line. If you are unsure about viewing don't be! You WILL LOVE IT!!<br /><br />Just purchased this soundtrack..loved it all..
0553826166|4.0|The book was delivered in a timely fashion , no problems .  Condition was typical for a used paperback . Great bargain in my opinion ; one of Lee Child's best and wildest stories at a bargain price .
B0086700CM|4.0|I love temple run honest its my fave app but on the kindle fire it glitches out sometimes and wont let me jump so if they fixed it I would give it 6 stars, not 5 (:
B008ASLK8A|3.0|The sequel is considerably worse than the first movie with the character it portrays. Robert Downing Jr was brilliant in the first movie; and he plays Holmes to the best of his ability in this one. However, overall, it is a terrible Holmes story. The story is handed to you in this one. There is no twist, no subversive plot change that Holmes is known for. It follows a straightforward, overused and cliche path of an arms dealer trying to start a World War. That's it. Instead of story substance, the director introduced far to many mindless action scenes. The action had its moments, but Holmes is often reduced to a pure fighter, not the brilliant, cunning detective he actually is. I wouldn't say avoid the movie... It's a good action movie. Just don't expect the brilliance of Holmes.
B005ZUR724|5.0|I purchased this game and have been well pleased.  I have had no problems and love the game.  I cant wait for add on content.
B003QSO11W|5.0|As a writer, what tends to \\"make\\" a movie for me is the dialogue.  I thoroughly enjoy watching a movie so many times that I can quote it word for word, and you are only inspired to do that when the words are worth remembering.  George Armitage's Grosse Pointe Blank occupies a top spot in my list of favorite movies to quote.  Other aspects of the movie that make it so re-watchable are the soundtrack, the chemistry between Minnie Driver and John Cusack (and the entire cast, really), and the original plot.  John Cusack is Martin Blank, a professional assassin, growing weary of his stressful job.  Marcella, played by Joan Cusack, is his semi-neurotic but loveable secretary.  Their comedic banter is priceless throughout the movie, and it is her character that suggests Martin go back to his hometown of Grosse Pointe to attend his high school reunion.<br />  So his eventual--but reluctant--agreement to go is what kick-starts the action in the movie.  I like to suspend disbelief when watching a movie, as long as it stays within the realm of possibility. Likeliness of someone who makes a living as an assassin being a sweetheart and completely sane deep down?  Slim.  It's a very romanticized concept, but it makes for a very interesting character, and a very interesting romance between Martin and Debbie (Minnie Driver).  Nearly every single movie ever made has romance in it, so to spice it up by making the female protagonist have to cope with the idea that her soul-mate has killed hundreds of people for money is, to me, brilliant.  And maybe I find it so brilliant because of Minnie Driver's sheer on-screen genius.  She's as unique and memorable in her acting as she is aesthetically.<br /> Really, between Joan Cusack, John Cusack, Minnie Driver, Dan Aykroyd and Alan Arkin the movie couldn't have been more perfectly cast to my liking.  Aykroyd as Grocer, the prozac-popping rival assassin with a personal vendetta against Martin Blank and Arkin as Dr. Oakman, the nervous psychiatrist who wishes Martin never told him about his real profession. Each character and respective actor chosen to play them is hilariously successful and also cohesive in relation to the rest of the cast.<br /> Anyways, Martin Blank's development throughout the movie and his journey to becoming a functioning human being capable of being in a loving relationship with his long lost high school beau has ingenuity and is rife with clever dark humor.<br /> John Cusack almost always involves himself with the soundtracks of movies he acts in, and Grosse Pointe Blank is no exception.  His keen taste in music shines through Grosse Point Blank's two disc soundtrack, and not to mention Joe Strummer, frontman of legendary punk group The Clash, composed the score for the entire movie AND helped pick out songs for the soundtrack.  The Clash is my favorite band.  This movie was made for me.  And, embarrassing as it might be to admit, I have a huge soft spot for eighties music.  Since the plot of this movie centers around the high school reunion of a class that graduated in 1986, the music that Debbie, a radio DJ, spins all weekend in honor of her old classmates coming home are all her nostalgic throwbacks (aka my favorite songs EVER).  So that was just the icing on the cake for me.<br /> There's a lot of violence in this movie, considering quite a few of its characters are professional killers, but it's not glorified or even emphasized, it's a necessary part of the plot.  It's downplayed, and almost performed distractedly, in an obligatory way.  In a world where films are saturated in gratuitous sex and violence, this movie is refreshing.  There is beautiful, quirky, fun romance all throughout, but not a single sex scene.  It's unnecessary.  Cusack kills a man with a ballpoint pen, but that action culminates in almost losing the love of Debbie, it isn't macho or rugged.  Lastly, the writing is so intelligent and well done that you end up sympathizing with and relating to an assassin.Game, set and match.
B0071MV540|4.0|This movie will keep you laughing. You will love it! The characters do a great job. Some of the plot could have been different but overall it's a thumbs up.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I love this book! It makes me feel<br />like i'm on a quest of my own. It also  makes  me remember<br />a game my friends and I play where we get to<br />make up our own demigod. I love it! (the<br />book and the game).
B000KITQK2|4.0|Got this after originally searching for a Sansamp like preamp/modeler.  Review I read said it can work with bass as well as an acoustic which it obviously designed for.  Lots of reviews question the sturdyness of the pedal for live application but I don't...  It's not a stomp box people and it's debate able whether or not you would even have to turn it on and off in a live situation.  Everyone who is getting this is hoping to improve their tone whether it's live or studio.  The on off button definitely could not handle being stomped on like a BBE or a MXR pedal but if your using this live why would you be bypassing it?  Mine is just going to stay on.  Besides the the bypass is more sturdier and more attractive than the pic reflects.<br />  I took it out of the packaging and dialed in the recommended setting for an acoustic Eq.  I have a Yamaha FGX-04-LTD acoustic/electric with Fishmans matrix infinty pickup through the fishman SA-220 which sounds crisp but lacked some warmth.  I chained the ADI21 with a BBE sonic stomp after it to the PA.  After I dialed in the recommended EQ for acoustic and turned it on it was undeniable.  It sounded great bring an added warmth that was lacking in my sound.<br />  Tried it today with my 5 string bass and it sounded great.  I just used the recommended setting for bass and did the same thing.  Another reviewer wrote his low B never sounded so clear.  Might disagree a little bit.  My bass is a lower midrange instrument.  While it did give much needed boost of warmth and presence I think it is still no replacement for a quality instrument or a quality amp.  In the meantime though if your playing warrants the upgrade this will satisfy your discriminating ears.  Very pleased with this pedal excited to see what I can do with my own custom eq'ing as well as recording...
B007K3JCAE|2.0|The plot is all over the place, and the stiff, sometimes corny dialogue is at times difficult to discern. The flashback sequences that are supposed to explain things more often than not are just as confusing as the movie. The slow motion scenes after a while just got irritating. At least the ending brought a bit of clarity, but it was a mess getting there. With some better direction and editing, perhaps this would have been a more enjoyable movie.
B001676320|5.0|I may eventually burn a whole in this DVD due to the excessive wear. I play it more than often. The music and  video clarity are amazing. If you like Chicago and EWF, you are gonna love this DVD.
0099579936|1.0|So my friend advised me to read that book, I'm ready to kill her now. It should be called fantasy of a teen virgin. Seriously, the plot is full of lie. Too many repetitions... Just awful.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|It's a good mix- a Myst-inspired combination of hidden object, jigsaw, and assorted other puzzle types.  It's a fun diversion, and worth the purchase.

B004JN1D2I|5.0|This is an excellent and easy read. I loved this series and can't wait for the series to come out on DVD.
B006RED4GA|2.0|The movie started engaging enough, but shortly it turns into a bad school film project.  The thing that annoys me the most is the holes in the logic.  Many things do not make sense!<br />Don't waste your time watching this.
B005LAIHR2|3.0|There seemed to be a certain amount of gloating in some of today's entertainment headlines as they branded Tom Cruise's latest movie a bomb.  Of course, that seems to be the way the media (and by extension, the public) handles our idols: build them up to impossible heights and then pull the rug out from under them and watch them fall.  It's a vicious game, but one that's been played out for as long as there have been celebrities, chroniclers, and an adoring public to worship both.<br /><br />That being said, \\"Rock of Ages\\", which opened on Friday, is far from being Tom Cruise's best movie, or even a very good movie, for that matter.  It's not even really a \\"Tom Cruise\\" movie, although his character is one of several whose lives revolve around a glitzy rock nightclub on the Sunset Strip in the 1980's.  But, for all its shortcomings, what \\"Rock of Ages\\" manages to be is highly entertaining, in a campy, big hair, over-the-top sort of way, kind of like the illegitimate offspring of \\"Hairspray\\" and \\"This Is Spinal Tap\\" by way of Broadway (where it actually played).  Set against a soundtrack of Journey, Def Leppard, Poison, and a host of other 80's bands, \\"Rock of Ages\\" attempts to tell the story of Sherrie, an Oklahoma girl who heads to L.A. to find a new life.  Stepping off the bus with $17 in her purse, Sherrie meets a bar back named Drew, who works at the famous Bourbon nightclub and aspires to be a rock god like his idol, Stacee Jaxx.  After a thief steals Sherrie's belongings (including her record collection), Drew manages to get her a job at the Bourbon, ruled by aging hippie, Dennis Dupree, and his emcee/right arm, Lonny.  Dennis and Lonny have their own problems with the mayor  and his ultra-conservative wife who are trying to close the club for unpaid taxes, but soon they see salvation when no less than Stacee Jaxx, himself, agrees to perform at the club for free!<br /><br />There's a slight love story between Sherrie and Drew but it gets lost in the big time rutting of Stacee Jax and the rock and roll crowd hanging around the club; and soon enough, there's a conflict that drives our young lovers apart, but do we care?  Of course not!  It's too much fun watching Tom Cruise puff out his chest and suck in his gut while strutting around uttering profound banalities in the role of rock god, Stacee Jaxx.  Cruise has often been a good actor in films and, at times, he's even great.  But, here he is guzzling booze, hamming it up in leather chaps and a glittery jockstrap, a cowboy hat and bandana, and having a grand old time, in much the same way that William Shatner was able to do when he successfully redeemed his career as Denny Crane in television's \\"Boston Legal\\".  Cruise is a hoot, and the screen is electric when he's on it.  He evens sounds like a rock star during his big numbers.<br /><br />Also a lot of fun to watch is Alec Baldwin, as the Bourbon's proprietor, Dennis, a seen-it-all, heard-it-all type who looks like a sausage with long hair stuffed into his laid back rocker/hippie attire.  Ditto for comedian Russell Banks, who plays Lonny with a certain degree of panache.  The young lovers--\\"Dancing With the Stars\\" Julianne Hough and newcomer Diego Boneta--do their best but are completely overshadowed by performances of the big-name cast.  That their romance is so blandly portrayed doesn't help matters, nor does the fact that Julianne Hough's voice is too wispy to belt out the heavier numbers required of her.  I was also rather disappointed in Catherine Zeta Jones, too seldom seen onscreen these days since her dynamic performance more than ten years ago in \\"Chicago\\".  Zeta Jones is an accomplished comedienne, as well as a decent singer and dancer, but she really seemed sort of wasted in the role of the mayor's holier-than-thou wife.  Bryan Cranston, Mary J. Blige and Malin Akerman do very well in smaller roles that are crucial to the script, and Paul Giamatti is realistically oozy as an unscrupulous band manager.  And justfor good measure, there's a pet ape--I'm not sure what kind--who is genuinely amusing.<br /><br />If you weren't a fan of the Big Hair Bands of the `80's chances are you're probably not going to much like \\"Rock of Ages\\".  It's slight, silly, affectionate, overlong, often funny, excessive, sexy, and big-budgeted, a fun, if forgettable, tribute to an over-the-top era.

B0058YPG1G|5.0|My addiction to this series is no different from the addiction of the methamphetamine users who are the consumers that main character Walter White supplies.<br />Take a lifelong nerdy high school chemistry teacher, make him go off the deep end when he is given two years to live, throw every crazy unimaginable problem someone who cooks meth can have at him and you have something so suspensefull you can't tear your eyes away.<br /><br />Lead actor Bryan Cranston's wrinkled face and perpetually horror stricken expression supplies the backdrop to some truely gruesome yet fascinating situations.  This character wallows in deception and immorality, lying continually to those he loves, never giving a moments thought to what he is actually doing to contribute to the misery of the addicts he is supplying.  Any thoughts of right and wrong are strangely lacking in this man.  And yet, his friends and family continue to see him as a good and decent fellow.  His wife finally must accept that he is a constant liar and up to no good but gets sucked into his greed.<br /><br />All the acting is great in this.  From Walter's wife Skylar, who starts out as naive and moral and quickly succumbs to join her husband in his persuit of money, to DEA agent Hank, who although good at his job is obnoxious consistently in his forced, crude insulting humor, to his wife Marie who has amusing episodes of kleptomania, each character is fleshed out and interesting. Sleazy shyster Saul Goodman (s'all good man) provides comic relief.<br />Son Walt Jr. provides the one character that remains pure, in contrast to his parents.<br /><br />Never have I seen anything that threw at the characters so many horrific dangerous situations simultaneously.  Danger comes at Walter from every possible place.  His life<br />becomes a juggling act of lies, violence, drug cartel murderers, and greed.  While it was baffling to see this lifelong good guy turn into such a cold violent monster so easily,<br />it was fun to see him squeek by continually as he walked the criminal tightrope between life, prison, and death.<br /><br />There were lots of glaring instances of ridiculous improbability at the end of the last episode which unfortunately I can't reveal here or it would spoil it for people who haven't yet seen it.  These instances were disappointing to me, as up until then this show had been pretty believable, without too many loose ends.  One concerns reporting to work at a drug lab in plain view of lots and lots of people and not expecting to get caught as well as leaving your car parked in front of it every day.<br /><br />Season Five begins next month.  Hopefully you will be caught up with all the Season Four episodes by then because each episode is a continuation of the last.<br />As for me, I can't wait to see where this picks up.  Will Walter continue his drug making?<br />How will he get it sold?  What will happen to his partner?<br /><br />This is the best TV dramatic serial of all time in my opinion.ee him squeek by continually as he walked the criminal tightrope between life, prison, and death.<br /><br />There were lots of glaring instances of ridiculous improbability at the end of the last episode which unfortunately I can't reveal here or it would spoil it for people who haven't yet seen it.

Both when you have it...And when you don't.\\"<br /><br />In DELIRIUM, Lena Haloway fled to the Wilds before the society could \\"cure\\" her of her amor deliria nervosa (love \\"disease\\"). Her boyfriend Alex wasn't so lucky.<br /><br />In PANDEMONIUM, we follow Lena Morgan Jones's journey through the Wilds where she meets an Invalid named Raven and becomes part of a group of Invalids traveling from homestead to homestead in order to survive.<br /><br />The book is told in alternating chapters: The \\"then\\" (her six months in the Wilds) and the \\"now\\" (infiltrating NYC to keep tabs on the DFA who promote the cure). It's in NY where Lena meets Julian Fineman, son of the head of the DFA, a boy scheduled to be cured even though it may very well kill him.<br /><br />\\"In Zombieland, someone is always watching. There is nothing else for people to do. They do not think. They feel no passion, no hatred, no sadness; they feel nothing but fear, and a desire for control. So they watch, and poke, and pry.\\"<br /><br />I made the mistake of reading Allie Condie's MATCHED and CROSSED in between DELIRIUM and PANDEMONIUM, which made things especially confusing and difficult to remember which was which (it didn't help that two character names are the same in both sequels, both are told in alternating chapters, and both take place largely in the Wilds/Outer Provinces).<br /><br />While Lauren Oliver is one of my favorite authors, she is known for maddening endings. PANDEMONIUM has a very slow start (it took over 100 pages for me to get into it) and I went ahead and read the last page to see what I was getting into. If you care about suspense at all, DO NOT RUIN IT BY READING THE LAST PAGE first.<br /><br />Rating: Three and a half wings.<br /><br />This review originally appeared on [...]
B0059XTV4Y|5.0|I was rather disappointed with this video.  It jumped back and forth between the current day and the real story of Wallis and Edward in such a way it took a few moments to figure out where it was.  Also it really didn't make much sense in the present day story which was quite confusing.  I had expected so much more.  The only other Madonna film I had seen was Evita and it was so much better.<br /><br />The video was delivered very quickly and was in excellent condition.  I wish I could say as much for the actual story.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Horrible, horrible book. Other reviews say it all. I just wish I hadn't spent money on this crap. They (whoever is to blame) should compensate me for the billions of brain cells I lost in the process
B005K17RU0|5.0|would definitely recommend this to everyone! a a a a a a a a a a a a a a.
B0072V3AFW|5.0|I personally had never seen Django before I read about it in Fangoria so I rented it a few weeks ago,I liked it so much I purchased it. This genre is one of my favorites to collect,I put this one right up there with all the Leone films.The production values are a lot better than most Italian films of this type.Django has a lot of great action scenes with excellent back ground sets,two that stand out are at a water mill and at a graveyard.Highly recommend if you like Spaghetti westerns. Blu-ray looks great,clean and sharp.
0345803507|5.0|I wanted to find out what all the recent hype was about surrounding this book. I have to say after purchasing, I could not put it down. Great story, kept me wanting to keep reading it.
B005LAIGW8|2.0|As a big Ghost Rider fan dating back to the 1970's comic book, I must say that this movie was a big letdown. I was one of the few people that actually liked the first Ghost Rider film. While it was no work of art, I thought it captured the look and the feel of the character pretty well. This latest effort really has no soul, its all over the place. I like Nic Cage as an actor, but I really wished he had stepped aside and let someone else take the role. Ghost Rider is one of the most powerful and feared heroes in the Marvel universe but in this film he is depicted as a twitching skull-faced clown. The first film was a hell of a lot better. I am glad I didn't listen to my 8 year old son and buy this.
B005F6NA5G|3.0|I bought this album particularly for the cut 'Tequila'.  This is solid George Benson, hard driving, clean guitar work.  I especially liked the keyboard support on this cut.  The rest of the album is good, but calmer.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is really fun for the whole family.  absolutely love it!  highly recommend &amp; can not seem to decide what to play with so many choices to choose from
0307887448|4.0|With 800 reviews already, there's not much to add to this, except to say this is a fun, engaging read.<br /><br />If you grew up in the 1980s, or are nostalgic for that era, then author Cline will find something for you. I don't think there was a single reference I wasn't at least hazily aware of. I'm not sure that counts for much, but it was fun to recall things I haven't thought of in 15-20 years.<br /><br />That is probably the flaw - since I know all this, I was totally connected. But another reviewer just noted that if you're a child of the 1990s, you won't have the same point of view. I really don't know what the audience is outside this particular age group - I'm not saying it's limited, but that I don't know.<br /><br />I'm not going to say about anything about the plot - it is neat and interesting. But first and foremost (to me), this is a nostalgia book - if that works for you, you'll love it, and if it doesn't work, you won't. I would flip through the first 30 pages or so, and you'll get a feel for it. If you're intrigued by that point, you'll probably like the whole thing.
B002ZG98UA|5.0|This Resident evil movie really is keeping the series going for me. Even with bad guys from Resident Evil five. And to top it off they brought Chris Redfield into the movie so maybe there is a chance we could see him again along side his sister in Resident Evil five or Six. I read the review for Resident Evil five and it said Leon will be in it. And from what we see and the end credits on this movie, yes the only and only Jill Valintine makes an appearance. Im so exited.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|What a waste of money!  I had such a good laugh at reading similar reviews on this book - very accurate and true.  I honestly believe there should be some sort of age restriction shown with books?  To me this was absolute rubbish and I did not even make it past chapter 3.  Yig!
B007K3JFUQ|2.0|imo, the movie as hardly any plot, seems pasted together from a series of loosely related scenes and has far too many boring action scenes.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|I don't have a well-versed couple of paragraphs for this final book in this series. All I can say is I read the reviews before I bought it...said I would NOT buy it...and then I did...and I should not have. i am only 65% thru the book and at this point...I just want it to end so i can move on to something else. Heed what ur gut is telling u and don't buy it, no matter how much you want to find out about Cersei and Dany....who is a twittering fool who has not accomplished her mission so far.
B007MAET4O|5.0|I won't go into the musical aspect of this release, though I happen to love it musically too.<br /><br />But I wanted to say a word about the Vinyl edition.  It is Excellent!  The sound is great, the vinyl is high quality 180g and VERY quiet.  I have an Audio-Technica AT-LP-120 that I play it on, through either computer speakers or an analog amplifier and a pair of ATH-M50 headphones (still working on rebuilding a real stereo).  I couldn't be happier with the sound.  The packaging, while of high quality materials, is pretty standard.  The sleeves are not anti static, but are a heavy paper with a monochrome printing of the cover art on them.<br /><br />Overall you won't go wrong if you're a fan of John's and vinyl.  If you're not yet a fan of vinyl, please order this along with the AT-LP-120 you won't be sorry.
B006RUJST6|3.0|I got curious enough to read this after seeing all the 5 star ratings.  I, of course, didn't want to be left out of all the hoopla. Honest, I really tried to like the book. I had a very hard time getting into it but I thought maybe if I continue reading, I will soon see what the craze is all about.  A book doesn't have to be deep and perfect to get me impress.  Books are like fairy tales to me but I still want them to be half believable. I didn't get how they fell 'in-love' that quick.  I just didn't feel it.  Just when I thought the book is finally getting somewhere, another twist happens.  (Please stop reading if you don't want me to spoil the book for you!) When Layken found out about what her mom is facing, I didn't understand why she had to leave and run next door.  I know she was young, but isn't this the time to stay and give her mom the support she needed instead of running screaming out the door?! Arrghh..it was just so frustrating.  I would have understood the reaction if the girl was on drugs or something. I'll try very hard to finish it.  I'm just a little half way through the book.  I will change this rating if I see any redeeming quality.  If not, then the two star ratings stays.<br /><br />Ok, I finally finished the book. I'm glad I did but three stars is the best that I can give. I think the 'slam poetry' is good--but don't trust me on that as I don't know a thing about poetry.
B00881VLCE|1.0|Constantly crashes!  Useless!  (and that's the paid version)!  I tried deleting and reinstalling-still.doesn't work!  Needs some work Nd maybe it might be useful!
B0015DWJX2|4.0|I had read this book previously but decided that it was worth owning. I have reread it since and still find it a touching and compelling story.  I enjoy that the story is told through letters back and forth between various characters. It's an effective way to reveal the development of the relationship between the characters and the effect of German occupation on this small community.  It's also a good way to learn a little history.  The occupation of the Channel Islands is a almost forgotten part of World War II.  This book reminds me a little of Suite Francais- which I also recommend highly.  It's not a great grand story but more about the day to day effects that war has on people and how we rise or fall under pressure.
B001PB3RU8|1.0|fortunately, this album doesn't consist of 13 songs that sound nearly identical, and they don't all feature a caterwauling banshee.  oh, wait..
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Leps world has a lot of great levels you can play. Some are challenging and some are not. I LOVE IT!!!!!!!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Bought this and never regretted it! Got you hooked from Chapter one until the end! Tooooo hard to put down!
B004OYDVT0|5.0|I have never owned a CD that I so completely loved every song on it. I can't choose a favorite. I change it every day! Neither have I had a cd that I bought 3 or 4 of the same. I am afraid #1 that she will not surface again for 2 yrs or more and #2 that I will wear one out and not be able to purchase another because they are sold out! I hope she returns to us fans that bought these cd's....and bless us once again with that pure, perfect voice!<br />I am and have been nothing but Southern Gospel music fan for years, but I am sold on Adele 100%. I have double of everything she has out. I just downloaded her duet with Darious Rucker of the Lady Antebellum song \\"Need You Now\\". Awesome..she held notes long after his voice stopped. Hurry back Adele \\"We Need YOU Now\\".
B0086700CM|5.0|I think that this game is soooooooooo fun.it has great graphics and is very real looking. I luv it I luv it.
B0083GQ2A0|3.0|. . . slightly provocative flick.  And this comes from someone who has been pretty down on Liam Neeson's stuff lately.  Neeson plays a tired by life game hunter employed by Alaskan oil companies to protect remote workers from attack by Grey Wolves.  His flight back to Anchorage from a remote work site goes down in a snow storm and he and 7 other survivors must battle nature and face their own mortality to survive . . .  and then . . . of course . . . there are the wolves . . .<br /><br />A visually beautiful film.  Shot well.  The characters are somehow- though I am not sure how- decently enough developed to care about and the story is solid and not cookie cutter.  I kept thinking I knew where this movie was going- but it fooled me a bit.  A few surprises.  And some interesting dialogue.  Some good acting in this movie from some barely knowns.<br /><br />The big \\"huh?\\" thing on this movie you just have to accept is that there is no rescue coming for this downed plane- and that isn't really explained or even questioned enough by the survivors- at least not to my plausible satisfaction.  But - if you can get past that- it is pretty good film overall.<br /><br />Good late night watcher if you can't sleep.
B007I2BZIE|2.0|I had low expectations for this album, but I'm such a fan a bought it anyway. They play with spirit and passion but most of the material is not that great. Geddy's vocal melodies are perfunctory for the most part, and do not stand up on their own. I think part of the problem here is that Neil's lyrics are also not very memorable, so it's tough to make a good vocal part from a lyric that reads like text. There are not many memorable images to pull out here to stick in the listener's head. Some reviewers are blaming Nick R's production. I don't have a problem with sound quality, it's much better than the overwrought Vapor Trails.<br /><br />I was very happy to hear the song \\"The Wreckers.\\" To my ears this is the best track on the record. There is a lot of heart on that track with a memorable chorus. It's my favorite song from them in quite a while. But the 7 tracks before that left little impression. Still, it is a strong bright spot on the album, and I was happy for this momentary return to greatness. If you have completely written off the album, give that song another try. The other track I really like is the last song, \\"The Garden,\\" which breathes much better than most songs on the album. It's the biggest surprise here, they really stretch out and build the song nicely. The sparseness of the acoustic guitar and piano are very welcome after going through the rather incessant riff fest of the rest of the album.<br /><br />I'm grateful for the 2 good tracks on this album from my favorite band. The rest of it is not bad, but it is not great.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I can't remember the last time, if ever, I did a review on Amazon. It never seems worth it if there's already a fair rating on the book and solid reviews. But, in this case, I felt compelled to write anyway. This is a fantastic book. A gripping premise that's revealed at a perfect pace, always keeping you wondering. Fabulous characterizations that make you see each and every character as a real person. No cardboard cutouts, only in existence to move the plot. This world is as morally ambiguous as the real world. And great, great writing. I read a lot of sci-fi books at a scan pace, mostly concerned with the plot and not needing to read th same boilerplate phrasing over and over. Not this time. I read every word with pleasure. You should absolutely read this book. I look forward to his next.
B0086700CM|3.0|its fun don't get me wrong its fun but its the same thing over and over again there should be more levels or more of ANYTHING ELSE TO DO BUT JUMP AND SLIDE.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was fun to read!  A terrific premise, excitement, good plotting and good character development. No zombies, just regular people in a time far, far away.  I'll read whatever Hugh Howey writes!
B0086700CM|5.0|Though game play is simple in design, it is challenging but doable.  The graphics are really good and clear as well.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|After the first episode I immediately bought the second season! SHERLOCK continues to be awesome, breath taking and addicting. May the series live on and on. season two will have you gasping and cheering!
B004JZBGWI|3.0|Ready to remove program. Updates every day. It is a notepad program. Keep it simple. Updates are way out if control!
0061974307|5.0|Thus novel was one of my favorites of all time.  It kept me interested during the entire read, and I was disappointed when the book came to an end.  We reviewed it at our last Book Club meeting and everyone in the group (12) enjoyed it also.  I would recommend it to other readers, for sure.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|I hadn't written a review for an album in a very long time but this one motivated me. I am a huge fan of all genres of music and have been an avid listener of rock and roll music for my entire life. This week I just purchased The Beach Boys Pet Sounds OMR (original master recording) remastered in stereo by Mofi for Hybrid SACD. Pet Sounds has been one my favorite Beach Boys albums and among my favorite albums of all time. While doing some searches I ran across this brand new Beach Boys album. I listened to the title track That's Why God Made the Radio and decided to get it the next day. Now after listening to it all the way through for the first time I am absolutely floored! This album is so good! It captures the heart and spirit of the classic Beach Boys sound while also sounding fresh and new. I am an critical audiophile listener and I have found the sound quality and production on this album to be tremendous. It has a really nice flow from one song to the next which makes it a pleasure to listen to all the way through in one sitting. I have enjoyed listening to all the songs including track five The Private Life of Bill and Sue.<br /><br />Like many past Beach Boys songs the classic Beach Boys vocal harmonics on this album inspired some very deep emotional moments for me while I listened to it. It created images and brought back memories of my life in Southern California during the 1970s and 1980s...driving down Santa Monica Blvd to go Boogie Boarding at Zuma beach in late spring and early summer, camping at San Clemente state beach park with my family during the fourth of July, watching the sun set over the Pacific Ocean in the late summer afternoon with the waves crashing on the shore and driving down Pacific Coast Highway with the car windows rolled down and the ocean breeze in your face. Those past memories practically made me break down and cry with tears. While I have some instant favorite songs already I am sure I will grow to like them even more after repeated playings. I recommend that everyone gives this album a listen including new fans of this legendary group but I especially recommend it to all long time Beach Boys fans. My only regret now is missing my opportunity to see them in concert when they played at the Hollywood Bowl this past month. I heard it was a special experience for those who were fortunate enough to attend it. Thank you! The Beach Boys and welcome back!
B0087BIMT0|4.0|I have to admit I did not know what to expect after reading so mamy negative things about this movie. I have to say I really enjoyed it. Ryan Reynolds does a very good job of playing the super hero. The special effects are awesome but does not overtake the characters. GL may not be as famous as Superman, Iron Man, etc....but still an enjoyable film...Be sure to watch after the credits at the end begin to roll...As it seems to be more, a scene to suggest a sequel. I can't wait....Also the packaging for this, the steel box, is cool and it has some great extras.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Game is simple yet fun. Works as advertised. I've had it for a while as it HAS BEEN AND STILL IS FREE ON GOOGLE PLAY. I prefer to download from there when possible. Hope it helps ppl.
B007CKNX28|1.0|i loved the Stripes and im always open-minded to fresh, but quality musical experiences.<br />I give Jack credit for kind of reviving rock and roll, even though it's still dead....<br /><br />unfortunately this album soured all my notions and to a degree some of my respect for JW.<br /><br />On every song he pretty much sings in the same rapid-lyric, spiral-type cadence, almost like he's rapping.<br />He reminded me of Tupac almost on \\"Love Interruption\\" WTF?<br /><br />And the sense of melody and cohesion is just not there, the songs sound broken up and thrown together..<br />this shouldve been a demo of raw songs waiting to be re-polished.<br />I hear it sounds better when he plays it live, but even as a huge fan, Jack's live shows were never really very good to me.<br /><br />i think he needs to slow down his pace and take a at least 3 months to make a full-on masterpiece.
B0077SGMXM|2.0|Why make a FAOTD v1.8 free when a higher version is available in marketplace v2.0...and no Wi-Fi needed?  Not the first time Amazon has pulled this...buyer beware!!!
B0063GORYU|4.0|I like that when there is no Wifi available it runs fine.  Even better because there are no pop ups when you begin a game.  I recomend it.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Thouroughly enjoyed this book, couldn't put it down & took it everywhere with me, have now finished reading [[ASIN:B007IXWKUK Fifty Shades Darker: Book Two of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]] & now reading [[ASIN:B007IXWL2C Fifty Shades Freed: Book Three of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]. Don't know what I'm going to do when I've finished this story, maybe just dream of my own fifty shades, hmmmm!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|this book was on a lost of summer reading books for my school. i had seen the book in my local bookstore but nevdr read it, so i was excited to have an excuse to read it. granted, from the cover i expected it to be a horror book, and it wasn't. but it's a really good book nonetheless. jacob always heard stories when he was younger from his grandfather about an orphanage that he used to live in. in the orphanage, jacob heard that there were children wih special abilities, and his grandfather showed him pictures of the children. still, jacob never believed his grandfather's stories. eventually he goes to the island where the old orphanage used to be. i wont say any more about the story because i dont want to ruin it for whoever is reading this. it is pretty violent, there is a gory description of a bunch of murders, and most of the pictures in the book are really weird. but, the violence and weirdness are not the min focus of the book, so dont let that make you not want to read it.
B00001W9G0|3.0|and that is why he hoooked up with Katie b/c she jumped over backwards to make him physically happy, with the dinners, pampering, availability, chasing after, etc., and this made for such an unbalanced romance that was shallow and never created the moment even at the end where you think these characters were ever deeply in love and never have I seen Barbra with any of her kids in movies, what is with that??? guess those long red nails ever present in every age timeline might get messy with a diaper change... love both of these guys but bad lighting and choppy vacuous dialogue just created dissapointment... the surprise element is the communist party presence on college campus and the admiration for the soviets... thought she had a pic of Lenin on the wall and references to Leningrad but Stalin was in power, a real hero... what a mistake that was! so we end with Ban the Bomb, start with this film....
B004UID2LC|5.0|I got it on my kindle fire and I finally get to listen to a bunch of my favorite songs! love this
B000NMY7CM|2.0|I could not believe how much Bullock's character played to the annoyance of having to do rehab for her abs despicable behavior...yeah well I'm a writer is all she will cop to?? and that rehab is abhorrent, who could ever find a path to recovery in that environment, everyone just blaming their childhood to behave irresponsibly, just having a chat with ur Mum bout how they feel is so far removed from addressing the issues of addiction I am shocked anyone found this film useful... always the clown Gwen has to be in comic scenes which I find she reaches for at all times, cleaning a filty bathroom with a HUGE mop bucket on crutches, gimme a break and writing the big exit finale of Santa Cruz with like 8 lines, and littering like crazy, champagne and bottle in the river, pills out the window, had no hope for her when she completed her required 28 day stint... the saving grace is always my beautiful Viggo and the quickie love scene and the woods confession were the best scenes in the film...thank you again Mr. M!!!  if you are an addict many blessings and hope for recovery if you have to do this sort of process, watch Dr. Drew instead...
B00000F14B|5.0|I was involved in a production of Music Man at the local college.  This is a great show with lots of great music.
B001OQCV6A|2.0|no matter how much I increased volume could not decipher barely a syllable from Downey, so hard to follow plot cept for the constant barrage of gun fights, fist fights, fire, explosions, chase scenes, I counted how long each frame was permitted to stay on the screen, less than 1 second for majority of film.... I wanted to take in the absolutely beautiful set decoration, attention to detail, city scapes but nope Guy won't let me and what is with that dumb crow lurching around, talk about suspense! was thinking subtitles but that would not work with the frame speed so am very dissapointed... thought the reveals were the most interesting aspect as Moriarity slipped so ever slowly (hey thanks to paperweights!) to his leap into a sequel.. I cannot recommend... have never had this much of a problem with hearing dialogue, can't comprehend how Downey intentionally played this out... sigh
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is amazing for any age and if you just want to kill time! One of m favorite apps for kindle fire yet!
B005WUHAX8|3.0|This case does what it says.  Yes, it is waterproof.  I'm not entirely convinced the sound is \\"better\\" when in the case.  In fact, I think it sounds a little muffled, but if you are trying to listen to music through the IPhone speakers you probably don't care what it sounds like anyway.<br /><br />I have two small complaints.  First, this is the second case I've purchased.  The first seems to be having leaking issues after about 3 months.  I took out the O ring and cleaned it up and on the second test it seemed to be OK, but I've lost confidence in the integrity of the case.<br /><br />Second, it needs to come with a dock extender or the hole on the bottom should be redesigned.  Basically nothing designed to work with the Iphone or Ipod works without an adapter, special cord, etc.<br /><br />Bottom line, however, is that it seems to work pretty well.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I've decreased the number of stars from 4 to 2.  The rubber shell falls apart in a few months.  Mine came apart at the top as well as the button over the mute switch.  That wouldn't be so bad if their customer service / warranty was any good.  It's not.  If you make a warranty claim they basically blow you off and never get back to you.  I submitted a claim with pictures, serial numbers, everything they asked.  Two months later I'm still without a case with no explanation and no end sight.  I just got an e-mail today saying their customer service is having technical difficulties (?)<br /><br />FINAL UPDATE:  I've increased my rating back to 3 stars.  Their customer service did finally get back in touch with me after about five e-mails over three months, and they did send me a new case.<br /><br />In the end, there is nothing else I know of on the market that can actually do what this case says it can do.  It is cool during the summer to be able to take pictures and video of people diving into a swimming pool from underwater.  However, the long term integrity of the case is just not great.  The rubberis too soft and eventually tears off and then your back to a regular case with docking problems.
B005L38QK2|1.0|I anxiously awaited Diablo III to come out and attended a midnight release - that is how passionate I am about this game. I had no idea this Diablo III gaming mouse even existed and happened upon it accidentally while shopping for a range booster for my WiFi. I followed the very short instruction included that basically stated I needed to plug in the mouse and visit their website at SteelSeries.com/downloads in order to install the mouse and start using it. This failed due to an error reading \\"Pool after Burn failed\\" so I had to email their customer service support because they do not list a basic contact phone number. I received an email back from one of their reps stating he received my email, opened a ticket, and was passing me off to someone else who would get back to me via email in 2-3 days. That right there is unacceptable. Then the original person did email me back as I suppose the person he tried to pass me off to decided he did not want to help me. The email recommending me to take all these different steps to troubleshoot my issue was useless; even after following all of the instructions, the problem was not resolved. I responded back to the rep since his email stated to let him know if any of these methods worked, that no, this was unsuccessful and that now I was getting a totally different error message stating \\"0000C800 failed\\". His response to this? Silence. No follow-up response, nothing. I waited four days before sending an email back thanking him for his help and that I have no choice but to return the product to the store. SERIOUSLY, it's a $70 item, not a $5 item, and other than my disappointment in not being able to use what I thought was going to be an amazing addition to Diablo III, their customer service did not even care, which is what upsets me the most. They have what looks like fun and innovative products, but if they don't work, I have no reason to buy them. Their loss, I spend a lot of money on gaming. <shrug>
B004W4N55C|1.0|Doesn't work on ICS at all.  Simply force closes when the search box is used.  Is this really hard to fix?
B004QPOVF0|5.0|I'm very happy with my DVD-AC/DC Live at the Riverplate. It's an excellant concert done in South America; they had a great audience. Good Rock n'Roll music!<br />Amazon is great, you can find anything here.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have waited so long to be able to play with out my brother telling me to get of his ipod.
B005HSL626|5.0|this game is really fun!! I play it all the time and me and my friends or family have little competitions to see who can get the highest score!!! I love this game I think you should buy it and you will love too!!!!
B0086700CM|1.0|I think the game is stupid because there are so many glitches and its way better on an I pad and I pod touch :(
B007MJ9LA2|5.0|This is a wonderful cd. I love that it's mostly instrumental. Only one song with vocals. And that was super. Again, Santana delivers an awesome cd with great musicians.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|like the way it plays. lots to keep you busy. wish u could buy energy with food. or even power up with each task completion.
B0077SGMXM|1.0|since im not good at it i automatically give this game a ONE star rating. Does this aggrivate anyone on here?
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|I do not under stand why the critics hated this movie. I seen far worse that they could not speak more highly of. My only problem was reading the subtitles about 10 minutes in.
B000JML7EC|4.0|As a child, I only listened to someone reading this adventure to me. On reading this book for the first time as an adult, I found the story full of intrigue and drama. An entertaining 'boys own' adventure. This version contains many wonderful 'old english' words and phrases currently missing from modern works. Because of my enjoyment in reading this book , I will follow up by reading 'Silver' which was published recently.
1416549447|2.0|I guess I'm in the minority because I've had very mixed results. I took a chi running clinic in December and PR'd in a half marathon about five week later, by 18 minutes. I felt like I was having a running renaissance at age 44, but that only lasted another few weeks. Since then, I've been plagued by injuries. At this point, calf injuries have kept me from running for about 2.5 months, which makes no sense as the chi running books (and I have both of them) claim that you don't use your calf muscles with the method. That didn't make much sense to me when I read it, and it certainly doesn't now. So I guess my advice is not to expect a miracle cure and recognize that some of the advice and statements in these books make little sense from a medical standpoint--perhaps because the authors have no medical training. That said, I've been to plenty of sports docs and physical therapists over the years, and they weren't very helpful, either.

0307951529|5.0|What I love about this book is that it's for the everyday person. Chris uses real life examples from people around the world starting a wide variety of businesses. It's so refreshing that it's not targeting the elite, very small overall percentage of people who enter business plan competitions or who pitch for investment dollars - the kind most often featured in headlines or on TV shows. And it's nice that the people featured in Chris' book are starting companies to support themselves and their families and a lifestyle by choice and design. So often the elite few promising to give investors a tenfold return in a few short years work so many hours they don't know what a family or a life or a community is and if they deliver what they promise in their pitch, they sell for the sake of investor return often before a real company ever gets created. I love how tangible the businesses featured in Chris' book are and I love that there is so little ego involved on the part of the business owners - they are just people trying to figure out how to get by and how to truly have a meaningful existence.<br /><br />The other real value, in my opinion. of Chris' book is that he emphasizes the convergence of what you know how to do and what the market will pay for. Again, lots of people have ideas but the general misperceptions run down either the path of - I have created something nobody has ever thought of before and therefore, since it's so cool, I'm going to make millions - or - I have come up with an idea and the first thing I must do to get this business off the ground is to find someone else to invest lots of money in it, not realizing that it's pretty hard to do, it takes longer than you want it to, and if you're successful you no longer control what happens to your 'baby' of an idea. So kudos to Chris for highlighting what goes on far more often with far more impact on everyday lives - regular people using what they already know to create a product or service the market will pay for without much fanfare at all. End result - fulfilled lives and a way of navigating in this rapidly changing economy and workforce situation.<br /><br />I bought his book, I read it, and I promptly bought a few more to send to my kids and associates. This is a must read for anyone interested in knowing that entrepreneurship is not only for a special few.pay for without much fanfare at all.

B005LAIGIM|5.0|There hasn't been one comedy that I've watched with Eddie Murphy that I did Not find very funny and entertaining. This one is no exception. Eddie is introduced to a magical tree as he is convinced to believe that he only has one-thousand words left or else! From start to finish, his facial expressions, combined with a turn of events as he becomes silent is laugh-out-loud entertainment right to the end. The acting performance of a great cast adds the finishing touches. If you love Eddie Murphy comedy, you made the right choice! Highly recommended.
1423113462|2.0|I read Percy Jackson and the Olympians in six days. It took my just that many days to finish this one book. I was worried when I heard that Percy wasn't the main character for this book, and I was right to be worried. It's terrible!<br /><br />Here we have this guy who has no memories and is the son of Zeus's Roman counterpart, Jupiter, the King of the Gods. There's also this girl, Piper, who spends half her time musing about how hot Jason is and how much she wishes him to kiss her. Lastly, there's Leo, who's the least annoying of the three (despite him being called annoying in the book).<br /><br />I just couldn't get into this book, and like I mention in the title of this review, if I hadn't known Percy would once again be the main character in the next book, I wouldn't have finished this one. I was tempted many times to just go to wikipedia and read a summary of what happens in this book so I could move on to The Son of Neptune.<br /><br />In the first series, I liked very much that Percy was powerful but not in an over-the-top way (until the end, but that was sort of acceptable in his situation). Here, Jason is the son of Zeus/Jupiter. Percy was the son of Poseidon. He was not shunned, like he would have been if he had been a son of Hades, and he was not worshiped like he would have been if he had turned out to be the son of Zeus. But Jason IS the son of Zeus and everyone thinks he is sooo special. And it would have been OK if he showed how special he was, but he doesn;t show anything. He just keeps thinking how pretty Piper is and blah, blah.<br /><br />Piper is the stereotypical daughter of an actor who has no maternal figure. She is a problem child and constantly disappoints her dad by stealing things. She also turns down the clothes her super-rich dad offers her because... I don't remember. Whatever. Anyways, sticking to the overused background of the stunningly whiny but pretty girl, she hides the identity of her dad (she reveals it later, but that doesn'tmatter). And she hates that her mother gave her her blessing and made her look even pretty for about two days. Also, she kept wishing throughout the whole book for Jason to kiss her and Jason is thinking throughout the whole book that Piper is sooo pretty.<br /><br />Leo is tolerable. But that stuff about the curse of Hephaestus Cabin? I didn't like how it \\"broke\\" at the end of the book. It would have been better if Riordan showed us that later. I did, however, like Festus. And the flying boat. And the thing about sailing to Greece. I did not, however, like that the ship will be named after the original Jason's Argo, and having Juno call Jason the \\"greatest of all heroes.\\"<br /><br />Please, Percy has done stuff much more impressive than that.<br /><br />Yes, I'm being very biased towards Percy, but that's only because Jason got such... special treatment? And he basically had no personality. I wouldn't be so harsh if I hadn't expected something incredibly good from Riordan to follow-up the first series.<br /><br />I didn't like the romance. In PJO, there was tension, but I didn't think of Grover/Thalia/Tyson or whoever was going in the quest with Annabeth and Percy as third wheels. Here the tension is painful. I feel uncomfortable with Leo being close to Jason and Piper. How uncomfortable must Leo be, then, if I feel wrong even though I'm not there and Leo is?<br /><br />Oh, something I remembered about Piper: She should have made a choice about her dad. It hardly seems fair that she gets everything in the end. I know that her dad dying because she chose to help her friends would hardly have endeared her to the readers, but she is a Mary Sue. She can charmspeak almost anyone. I feel that should have been left out of the book. I'm still deciding if the All-Daughters-Of-Aphrodite-Speak-French is good like Percy talking to horses or just Mary Sueish, like the charmspeak. And the Drew thing was so wrong. She is no better than Drew by the end; they should have dueled.<br/><br />And Jason being able to survive witnessing Hera's true form? Gary Stu. This reminds me of bad fanfiction.<br /><br />In conclusion: My favorite character was Coach Hedge. Annabeth was good too, but Thalia seemed sketchy. We saw her too little, I suppose.
B007L6VR12|5.0|It's 1965, and this mystical-magical story will tug at the heartstrings as it entertains with delight for the entire family. Sam and Suzy are both age twelve, neither one of them is popular and they both have their own issues outside of their charming relationship. However, they are appealing to each other in a unique friendship when they decide to run away together in their own great adventure. Bruce Willis can play the role of just about anything, and in this captivating story, his acting performance is excellent, along with all the other characters. The heart-warming story is touching, enjoyable from start to finish, and very funny. A Magnificent fun-filled movie for the entire family. Highly Recommended!

B000OT8GCQ|5.0|Being a closet romantic, I'm always a sucker for a happy ever after, \\"Cinderella\\" ending. And as much as I do enjoy reading such stories, life is not always like that. It is this premise that is presented in \\"Dear John.\\"<br /><br />I found myself longing for a happy ending, even a twisted ending that would eventually give John his heart's desire. Yet, the story did not take that path. Instead, it took a truer, purer path as it wound it's way to the finale. And the ultimate lesson was even more precious, unconditional love. This love story goes beyond the traditional \\"feel good\\" and encompassed love in a purer form...a selfless love. Although the ending was sad for me, it was a cleansing rite of passage that depicted human nature and the heart's capacity to allow love in it purest form to prevail.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|There are much better erotica novels out there.  This book was boring because it lacked plot and was predictable.  The ending was very abrupt and didn't really leave me wanting more...a problem in a trilogy.  I feel like this book is so popular because most woman are unaware that there are many sexually explicit novels out there. The other \\"pornographic\\" novels  I've read have a more interesting and compelling plot.  Maybe this novel is more acceptable to the masses because it has become so mainstream, or maybe I just don't understand S&M. Lastly, I like my heroines to be strong, confident and independent.  It just sickened me to read about a main character so weak...though I'm sure she \\"comes into her own\\"  in the next two novels.  Again, soooo predictable.  Also another educated guess: she ends up with Ethan, Kate's brother.  Maybe I'm wrong, but it is likely I will never find out.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|I downloaded a sample of this book, which wasn't too bad, so I purchased it.  Everything after the sample is bad.  Very descriptive, but difficult to visualize anything.  The characters are all one-dimensional and never develop.  The book is geared for teenagers.  Goes on & on & very little happens.  Characters & situations are written in as needed, much as the Spring Byington character in You Can't Take It With You writes her book!  Save your money.  This is only the 1st book in what looks a series, which is unbelievable.

B007MNV5WU|3.0|I have been waiting for the update and heard it finally came out but it will not let me update
B005IQZB14|5.0|I purchased this specific ebook edition because I was intrigued with the idea of Oprah's new digital book club; I'm an admirer of Oprah Winfrey's; she's rarely recommended a story that I did not enjoy. I had also read some previous blog reviews and heard of Cheryl Strayed's book on NPR~I would have read the story anyway.<br /><br />The first line \\"hooked\\" me as I tell my own 7th grade writers-in-progress~I wanted to know why and how Strayed got to this point in her life. However, within just a few chapters into the story, I felt that I needed to get off the trail of this book~I'm a cynic and have no patience for whiny writers who feel that their troubles are unique or the only heartfelt tragedies in someone's life. Yes, Strayed suffered several stomach-punching experiences in her young life~mother died of cancer, family and marriage fell apart, promiscuous behavior tainted her relationships, used heroin without regard to her safety. I understand that she \\"needed\\" to hike the trail as therapy. Her voice (or sparkle as I say in class) just annoyed me.<br /><br />Now, you're probably saying~wait, you gave the book a 5-star rating. Yes, after a few day I got back on the trail with Strayed and finished her story. I'm the type of reader that can't stop reading a book~I can't move on until I've finished the book or magazine or whatever text it is that I'm reading. Also, I still trust Oprah to steer me in the right direction. I gave it a second try. I started over from page one last Sunday evening and read the last page on Wednesday evening~with a little moisture in my eyes. Strayed did not lead me astray.<br /><br />There is a point to her \\"whining\\"~her voice is what carries this story from one point to another; even if that voice is annoying, I had to listen to it. Strayed's word choice~extended metaphors abound in this story~creates images and pictures for the reader that make you think that you're on the trail with her. Strayed weaves her characters into her memoir like she weaves along the PCT~most are likable, some are not. But, she shows us these characters in such a way that we feel that we know them.<br /><br />If you purchase this particular edition, you will also get Oprah's highlights and notes. That is a bonus as it's the same price as the other ebook edition.<br /><br />Reader beware though. The language is vulgar and there are several references to sex and drug use~let's assume that you're big people and can handle it. If you're not big people (like my 7th graders), then you need to put it on your \\"Books I Want to Read Before I Die\\" list.<br /><br />Strap on those hiking boots, grab your ski pole, and take this journey with Cheryl Strayed. You might be disappointed, but it'll be worth it.<br /><br />Melissashe weaves along the PCT~most are likable, some are not.

034580404X|1.0|As the title says, I am deeply ashamed to admit that I read this trilogy. There we so many people raving about them that when the first book was awful, and the second book was awful, I had to read the third in hopes that it would redeem itself. Sadly, I was wrong.  The books are comprised of a high-school level writing with a sour plot in a lonely woman's unrealistic fantasy. I really feel like a thesaurus should have been given credit as the co-writer in these poorly published novels. I knew going in to this that these books were pure fifth but I suppose if I'm going to read filth, I want to know that an adult wrote it and these just felt like a child composed them. I also felt like the author was constantly putting the characters into situations (which were not very detailed) where they would want or need to have sex. And although the sex scenes were at times graphic, they were almost always the same sex scenes described in the same way. IE- The way his pants hung off his hips, he tied my hands together with his tie, I shattered into a million pieces, etc. By the third book, I was mostly skimming through these sex scenes, I had already read dozens of times in the first two books, and praying for it to end quickly. There also is not very much S&M in these books since Ana doesn't like it and the bondage they occasionally use is quite tame. I recommend these books to no one and will be recycling my copies very soon.
0062073281|2.0|First Sentence: Madison Parker had made Trevor Lord come to /her/ this time.<br /><br />How I Acquired the Book: Borrowed from my town's library.<br /><br />The Review: There are some books I read only because they reach no. 1 or whatever number on the bestsellers list, and I read them because I want to see what brought them there. L.A. Candy was one of those books, and so is The Fame Game. As soon as I started L.A. Candy, it became clear to me that this was a bestseller only because of its author, and certainly not because of its writing. The same goes for The Fame Game.<br /><br />The Fame Game is a spin-off series off of L.A. Candy. Instead of Jane being in the spotlight this time, we get to see Madison be the star. This didn't seem that interesting of a concept at first, but then I began to get interested. Madison was, by far, the most interesting character in the L.A. Candy series. Jane was boring as heck. So, I thought, even though it's still about reality TV (which I do not enjoy), since the boring character is out and a cool character is in, this should be much better than L.A. Candy.<br /><br />Well, it was better than L.A. Candy, but not by much. The characters, as I predicted, were very interesting and three-dimensional. Madison was the type of character you want to kill one minute, then the next, you feel so bad for her. The two new characters were a lot more interesting than Jane and Scarlett, and I liked them. The 2.5 stars this book deserves is all because of the characters.<br /><br />Because the plot just doesn't work at all. Some parts were ridiculously overdrawn and boring, and I found myself thinking, \\"Fame Game? Ugh, maybe a better name for this book would be Brain Pain.\\" It doesn't flow well; the majority of the book is a buildup to a climax completely unrelated to the buildup. Meaning, Ms. Conrad could have done away with the buildup and we'd be fine. This book is all about jealousy. Madison is so jealous, and in a way, jealousy helps her, but most of the time, it destroys her. The climax had nothing to do with this struggle.<br /><br />All in all, fans of Lauren Conrad and reality TV will enjoy this book.

0062060562|4.0|Speaking as a woman who has worked closely with traumatic brain injury patients for going on 5 years now, I must say I really enjoyed this book. Much of it was true to life and reminded me of some of the people I have helped. While some of it was a bit far fetched, I believe it needed to be to tell the story Mr. Watson wanted to convey. It is a well written novel with a very thought provoking plot. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the workings of the human mind and/or those who like a good mystery and a thrilling read.
0142420891|3.0|First Sentence: Every morning I wake up and tell myself this: It's just one day, another twenty-four hour period to get yourself through.<br /><br />How I Acquired the Book:  Borrowed from my town's library.<br /><br />The Review (with MINOR SPOILERS): I suppose I should start off this review by saying that Where She Went is very different from its predecessor, If I Stay. For the first half, Where She Went was very slow, dragged in the plot, and felt as if it were some new trashy teen lit. While I was reading the first half, I kept thinking, \\"Wow, If I Stay would be better if it had stayed alone.\\" Where She Went certainly was not the book If I Stay was. In my opinion, although it didn't change mine, If I Stay had the potential to change people's lives. However, I can't say the same for Where She Went.<br /><br />While I thought the ending of If I Stay was a very nice and sweet ending, obviously, some others did not, and that is, I suppose, what prompted Ms. Forman to write this book. Where She Went picks up three years after Mia's tragic car accident that killed her family, but not her. But this time, the story's told from Adam's point of view. In the three years that have passed, he has become a rock star. Mia, meanwhile, has reportedly become \\"the next Yo-Yo Ma.\\"<br /><br />That was one major complaint I had with Where She Went: the whole unrealisticness of it all. (Hey, is that even a word?) Seriously, how, after three years, are they both supposed to be ridiculously famous? The improbability of that really staggers me, and detracted a lot from my reading experience. Even Adam describes it perfectly on page 228: \\"It's just: Kim. You. Me. We all came from this nowhere town in Oregon, and look at us. All three of us have gone to, well, extremes. You gotta admit, it's kind of weird.\\"<br /><br />Yes, Adam, it is kind of weird. Therefore I have no idea why your creator would choose to make it so weird.<br /><br />Moving on: One thing that really annoyed me in If I Stay was Mia's character. She was boring. Period. Adam is a totally different story. He's much more emotional, and much more interesting to read about. Mia, of course, is still quite boring, but now that she's in the third person, it's not quite as bad. I totally preferred Adam's voice to Mia's voice.<br /><br />Where She Went, at the core, is absolutely a romance novel. Gone are the thought-provoking questions that If I Stay raised; welcome, character interaction and thoughts. I don't think everyone who liked If I Stay will like Where She Went, but I definitely liked this book better. For romance lovers and lovers of Mia and Adam, this book is a dream come true. While the first half was sluggish and unforgivable, the second half redeems this book.<br /><br />I really wish Amazon would let us give half-star ratings, because I really want to give this book 3.5 stars, and this is a positive review, not a critical review. As a reference, I think If I Stay deserves 2.5 stars. So if If I Stay left you begging for more of Mia and Adam, read this. Your wish has been granted.<br /><br />-reviewed by a teenager.

B0088RQ4X4|4.0|I stand agog after watching this movie. The \\"professional\\" reviews would have you believe this movie was trash. It stand fast with (1) ERB's books (2) a coherent story and (3) the visual translation of ERB's books. I loved it. The marketing campaign was horrid and conveyed none of the tradition and perspective of the swashbuckling original. It modernized ERB's story (stories, actually, as it composited two books) for a modern audience and laid plausible groundwork for the ethos. Really, I'm more shocked at the reviews than at the minor flaws of the movie.<br /><br />Great, great, great. 4 out of 5. Honest.

The fact that that is the case astounds me. I am going to say that this is the best and most dynamic album they've ever put forth but then realize that will probably only last until the next album.  I have no idea how 12 people could give this album 1 star but those are usually the same people who go the concert and say \\"I just came to hear Tom Sawyer and Spirit of Radio\\".  The last song- The Garden is one of my all time favorite Rush songs already, its simply haunting. The Wreckers, 7 Cities of Gold, etc..there is no bad song on this album (like there ever is). Do not CONTEMPLATE getting this album..simply purchase it and see for yourself.  I can't wait to see them on the opening night of the tour in Manchester, NH. AWESOME ALBUM!!

B00846REIS|1.0|Okay, with roughly 100 pages to go, I think I've read enough. I just couldn't finish this book and find myself very disappointed that Ms. Day created her own story based on the widely popular E.L. James book, \\"Fifty Shades of Grey.\\" Sure, Christian Grey is now, \\"Gideon Cross\\" (I'm not a rocket scientist, but I figured out the initial exhange - along with changing \\"Ana\\" to \\"Eva.\\") But here's where I'm baffled: Ms. Day is actually a good writer. There's a reason I read as many pages as I did. Because of that fact, with each turn of the page, my heart sank for her.<br /><br />Without going into the meat of this story, if you've read FSOG, you essentially already know it. Yes, the people, places and situations have been jumbled around a bit, but for the most part; (and it pains me to say this since Ms. Day has such great potential), someone should have waved a red flag in her direction long before it was published.<br /><br />This is the first review where I am at a loss for words...
0425263908|5.0|Reviewed at Another Look Book Reviews<br /><br />A new book trilogy to get sex-cited about! I will fully admit, I'm excited.<br />Bared to You is marketed to the hoards of \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" book lovers and rightfully so. There are many easy comparisons but Bared to You is much more polished and put together; however no less addictive. I NEED book 2, now. I have told myself over and over again that when there is a trilogy book series, I shouldn't start them until they have all been published. I know this fact about myself yet here I am cancelling out summer by the calendar and counting the days until October when book two shall grace my shelves.<br />Here is my plea to Syliva Day on Twitter and her reply *giggles*<br /><br />&lt;&lt;on blog is picture of tweets>>><br /><br />Since Bared to You seems to be riding the coat tails of the popular E.L. James series, I'd like to point out my thoughts on that. The first thought on my mind is although you do have a young emotionally fractured billionaire male, Gideon and a recovered abuse victim college grad female, Eva, I could easily place this awesome couple in their own story and separate out from Fifty Shades. The same romance formula is present but it is a familiar plot used by numerous authors. It is the talent of the writing that separates out the weeds from the blooms and Sylvia Day's Bared to You is a bouquet.<br /><br />Gideon and Eva are powerfully drawn to each other and both are really emotionally immature. They have major hurdles to over come if they want to be in a relationship and I've never read a romance couple try so hard. It is not an easy task for them to hold on to one another when they both feel that they are broken people. Every time Eva gets upset she runs away and Gideon is just so freaked out about how much he has fallen for Eva. Their constant wavering about making it work is what caused me to keep reading and reading.<br /><br />Bared to You is an erotic novel and I love that there is a great story attached. Their intimate scenes are well crafted and smoking hot. They are not a raunchy couple but pure lust makes it impossible for them to keep their hands off each other. Now having said that, Bared to You was practically half way done before they experienced their first encounter. This statement is not a complaint because I love to really get to know my characters. There are no BDSM scenes in Bared to You but it does imply that there may be book 2. We will have to see how that plays out. There is enough kink and fire brimming between Eva and Gideon that it could go either way.<br /><br />Bared to You leaves the reader on a semi cliff hanger. Nothing to pull your hair over but there is an urge to want to pick up book two and dive in right away. Is it October yet?<br /><br />Teasers: steamy scene at the family home, a heavy unrevealed back-story to come, sexy limo ride, major jealous streaksy attached.

B0052VUNHC|4.0|This book is a difficult one to review. There were two major reasons why, one: I loved it; and two: it also disturbed me. Taking into account that this story is about Abby Abernathy, nicknamed \\"Pigeon\\" who is only 18 and Travis Maddox, who is around 20. Those young ages alone are reflective of how ridiculous their decision making continued to be. However, I appreciate the fact that Ms. McGuire wrote this story based on that fact. Her writing, which is in 1st person, and my personal preference, was exceptional and the story flowed throughout.<br /><br />Abby and Travis are both college students at Eastern University, but that's not where they first meet. The book begins finding Abby and her best friend, \\"America\\" attening an underground \\"fight club.\\" Obviously because it's illegal gambling, everyone knows to keep it a secret. The space is overly crowded as there are tons of frat boys and jocks in a small, yet hidden space where Travis is the star and fighter to beat. Travis also has a reputation of being a man-whore, with most of the girls STILL throwing themselves at him, regardless. (Very classy!) Abby catches Travis' eye right after yet another winning fight, (btw, he never loses), and immediately nicknames her, \\"Pigeon.\\" (Never did figure that one out.) However, Abby officially meets Travis in a college lunchroom along with her friend, America, who also happens to be dating Travis' cousin, \\"Shepley.\\" At first, Abby tries her best to stay away from Travis, knowing his reputation and seeing for herself how all girls react when he's in any given room. Though their attraction is mutual, they eventually settle on being just friends and their relationship grows...eventually leading to much more.<br /><br />At this point, the book is coming along nicely and I was enjoying it! Including the unique storyline, the back and forth banter and the humor of all the characters. Some of the story was predictibale, but there were things that happened which took me completely by surprise...which was good! Although, the disturbing factors of the book were the fights, (I already mentioned those), the underage drinking, (okay, we've probably all dabbled in that to some degree), however, the continuous and blatent drunk driving, not to mention Travis' complete (and scary) obsessiveness towards Abby and finally, a terrifying fire which starts at one of the fights, killing several people!! How was there NOT a police investigation involving Travis and/or the fight organizer, Adam? (Someone would've leaked the secret, right?) The fact that it was hardly mentioned and was horrific to the reader was frankly unrealistic and left a bad taste in my mouth!<br /><br />I would have given this story a fifth star because to be honest, it stuck with me when I wasn't reading it. Although, I did have to take breaks, if nothing else, to cool down from the constant teenage chaos. The story's ending hurt it's rating, which is when the fire took place. Would I recommend this book? Yes, but, it's not for everyone...<br /><br />(rprise...which was good!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is gripping, intense, personal, uplifting, frightening... and fun.<br /><br />I can't describe it, but this is NOT one of those inflated kindle reviews I see so often. This is the real deal.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|One of the most lovely, surprising, facinating and yes, disturbing books I have ever read. I was intrigued when I was introduced to this author and the controversy surrounding the contents of this book. I was also encouraged to read this story by a GR friend, not to allow all the negativity to influence me...and I'm extremely glad I did.<br /><br />The hero, \\"Christian T. Grey,\\" is a very wealthy, very handsome man and though he's unusually young, (27), to have achieved the kind of wealth most people can only dream of, he's equally carrying a dark passenger in the way of relationships and lovemaking. His BDSM preferences have severely limited his pool of the normal, run-of-the-mill women; which is OK, because, that's the way Grey likes it. Understandably, he is extremely private about his personal life and though he's a very charitable man, he's never been photographed with a beautiful woman at his side.<br /><br />Enter the heroine, Anastasia Steele. A 21 year old, beautiful, if not clumsy, woman, about to graduate college who captures the attention of this tycoon, and all bets (and \\"rules\\") are off. Anastasia, \\"Ana\\" begins making Grey think outside the box or I should say, \\"playroom,\\" which is beyond foreign to him, to put it mildly. Her affect on him is a first of many \\"firsts\\" for him and slowly, the layers of his disturbing past become revealed, but not entirely. The banter and humor, (yes, he has one) is extremely entertaining, especially his and Ana's back and forth e-mails and texts; which affords the reader hope that for once in Grey's life he could possibly \\"do\\" normal and vanilla.<br /><br />This is the first book in a series of three and though it's not for everyone, I was not offended in the least. That being said, Christian's unique \\"lovemaking,\\" (if you can call it that), understandably, isn't everyone's \\"cup of tea,\\" either. At any rate, I didn't like this book, I loved this book! I am continously searching for \\"new and different\\" in my romance endeavors and this one sure did not disappoint. All I can say is, Freaking WOW!\\"vors and this one sure did not disappoint. All I can say is, Freaking WOW!\\"
B000HF0KXU|1.0|This rates among one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  The action and sex feels like the writers had a checklist and they shoved it all in to check everything off the list.
B00845PV16|4.0|This is an awesome fun movie!  It's a comic book so I didn't go in expecting a lot and the movie surprised me with a lot more funny and cool moments than I thought it would have based on the overall rating it received.  Great action scenes, cool special effects and a pretty decent story.  I think everyone should remember that this is first and foremost a comic book and suspend you disbelief and remember when you were a teenager and don't be so old and grumpy.  My wife and I are in are 40's and both loved it.  We are also not big comic book readers but enjoy superhero movies.<br /><br />I hope there's a sequel. . .
B007XWFZSA|4.0|Victor Cheng brings a lot of sense to the preparation of case studies. His approach is based on understanding the process, and building simple and clear structures. It is vastly more relevant than the other celebrated books (I am thinking of case in point in particular, which I find very poor).<br /><br />However, for those who are familiar with the LOMS program from Victor Cheng, and have been following his emails, there is little new material.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this book very strongly, for the following three reasons:<br />- it is well thought out and absolutely relevant to case interview preparation<br />- it is full of common sense, the principles are easy to remember even if they require practice to apply<br />- it is reasonably priced
0312641893|5.0|In this futuristic retelling of the classic Cinderella story we are introduced to Cinder- a cyborg (human but with technological enhancements) and famed mechanic of New Beijing, working in her weekly stall at the market when she meets Prince Kai of the Commonwealth. Incidentally, he needs her mechanical expertise to repair an android that holds some critical information. This fateful encounter begins Cinder's whirlwind quest for freedom from her `wicked' stepmother, with a backdrop of political intrigue amid a widespread deadly plague. I picked up this book after hearing nothing but high praise for it in the days before release. Plus I'm a huge science fiction geek, and love fairy tales, so this just seemed like a perfect combination for me.<br />  I loved the cover, it's simple in its design but iconic in the way it  brought together the story of Cinderella using the `slipper' and science fiction by showing the tiniest hint of mechanical skeleton with a bold red colouring for the shoe to catch your attention.<br />  I tore through it in a day, I honestly couldn't put it down because the pace was perfect. The moments of action were interspersed with slower dialogue scenes, but these slower scenes are vital to explaining the intricacies of the plot and tended to have one-liners, but I absolutely loved the one liners - no matter how corny they are, they lightened the mood in serious situations and brought life to the characters. The plot was a bit predictable, but I think that's to be expected with a retelling- most people know what generally happens, but the foreshadowing and twist reveals were still brilliantly executed.<br />  The setting is a rich eclectic mix of modern and traditional architectures which make up New Beijing. The technology mixed with the more slum like areas were extremely effective in showing the social divide, and the gruesome details of what becomes of plague victims.<br />  Oh the characters. I LOVED Cinder's sidekick robot Iko!! Iko was just so adorable and reminded me of the Tachikoma tanks from the manga/anime Ghost in the Shell, I had the dubbed voice and their little claw flailing expressions running through my head whenever Iko was talking. If you've never seen Ghost in the Shell and these Tachikoma's read Cinder and then watch this: [...]<br />  Cinder to me was a very level headed, rational- straight forward individual, and this is probably the robotics side of her talking, but you can see the human side in the way she shows concern and emotions for others, Marissa  just did a great job balancing out her features.<br />  Then there's Prince Kai... I'm quite conflicted as to what I think about him, one thing's for sure he's not your typical hoity toity royal, and that's where he wins some brownie points, especially in the way he interacts with others, but there's just some certain elements to his character such as self depreciation that gets a little annoying over time.<br />  One set of antagonists in the form of Cinder's stepmother Adri and stepsister Pearl are perfect as the cruel slave drivers, in contrast with the other stepsister Peony as a kind friend to Cinder. Then there's Queen Levana, ruler of the totalitarian and threatening Lunars from the moon, with their whole mysterious background filled with myths, legends and magic. I can't wait to find out more about the Lunars.<br />  When I finished reading Cinder, my first thought was huh, this is kind of like Sailormoon meets Battlestar Galactica. At this point I didn't know that Marissa started out writing Sailormoon fan fictions - but after I found out I was even more excited about this because as a 90's kid, Sailormoon was the standard breakfast TV show (I was almost always late for elementary school because the show didn't end till 9 am. )  and it was just a great reminder! All in all Marissa did a great job taking the bones of the Cinderella story and making it her own, this is definitely a must read!reminded me of the Tachikoma tanks from the manga/anime Ghost in the Shell, I had the dubbed voice and their little claw flailing expressions running through my head whenever Iko was talking.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|When I first saw the trailer a few months back, I knew right away it would be a major flop. Whoever did he marketing and trailer did a horrible job! The movie was great, and I wanted a sequel right away! The marketing/trailers did not do the actors justice. As well. I didnt even know there were a lot of good actors in it.  Maybe Disney was too complacent in that it would do well because it's a Disney movie?<br /><br />It's a shame that Disney lost a lot of money in this that for sure thered be no sequel. It is worth he buy! My son and husband also loved it, also much to their surprise.
0439023521|5.0|I first received this book from my book addict twin Nicole with rants and raves about it, after she picked it up in an airport on her way home from Peru (I'm jealous that she goes on so many adventures) and finished it on her flight home. I let it sit on my shelf for awhile, until one day I went on a family fishing trip and since I never catch anything anyways, I figured I'd bring a book. After setting up my chair, baiting and casting the line I started reading.<br />  I stumbled through the mundane first few chapters, and was about to give up because honestly not much was happening. When I look back on it now, I realize it was to set up the skills and back story that would be vital to Katniss later on. By the time we came to the ceremony where the tributes are chosen, I was hooked. There was no stopping me now that the ball was rolling, there was political intrigue, action, suspense and a cast of colourful and diverse characters.<br />  I spent the next few hours completely enveloped in the book ( I lost track of time, didn't reapply sunscreen and got some pretty bad sunburn), and it was completely worth it to keep reading! It wasn't just a physical battle that went on here, there was so much political intrigue and survival strategies too.<br />  The cover is pretty nondescript, plain and with me being a sucker for pretty things, I likely walked past it several times in a book store and didn't stop to look at it. The symbolism on it doesn't even become iconic until you get into the later parts of the story, but now with the impending release of the movie, the mockingjay pin and what it signifies has exploded into the mainstream as a very identifiable figure.<br />Collins did a great job building each set that the story takes place in, I didn't have a difficult time envisioning the soot covered village of district 12, or the dangerous expanses of forest to the metallic glamour of the Capitol.<br />  The character of Katniss is loyal, fierce and willing to do whatever it takes - even killing, if it means her loved ones survive. She's a great strong character, and since she's from one of the worst off districts, it's great to see her rise up and be the underdog that no one expects.<br />  I have to say out of the two main boys, Gale and Peeta, I definitely root for Gale, to me he was the more likable character. Gale is the confident, skillful childhood friend of Katniss who understands how much work it takes just to make sure their families have some food on the table at night. Whereas Peeta - although from the same district as Katniss and Gale, he tended to live a much more sheltered life and I honestly didn't think he'd hold it together for very long, but he definitely had some surprising tricks up his sleeve, and what he lacks in brute strength he makes up for in cunning.<br />  The other characters such as Haymitch, Effie and Cinna each had a unique and easily distinguishable persona's. They were looser characters that were a great dynamic to Katniss' more serious focused persona. I especially love Cinna, he's a fashion designing genius!<br />  Once the reader is pulled into the preparations for the Hunger Games the action and drama are so well balanced that it can definitely keep the attention of boys and girls alike. There are romantic elements, but they're kept to a minimum and don't really detract from the intensity of the storyline. There is quite a bit of graphic violence - but with the whole premise of the story being last one standing wins, it's pretty compulsory to have some kind of death and mayhem. Really it's no worse than your average action packed movie these days.

The ending was simply BRILLIANT, and I had no choice but to start over.  On second read, so many things popped out at me, giving the second pass an entirely different perspective.<br /><br />Yes, the \\"sex\\" may turn some people off, but the underlying story of two people trying to come together in a meaningful relationship full of challenges and obstacles just grabbed me and wouldn't let me go.<br /><br />It's a great read.... would recommend to one and all.

0596007124|5.0|This is by far the most entertaining technical book I've ever read. It's incredible how it manages to be so accurate also. It's like the author knows what is going through your head at the exact moment something is being explained. Just when you start to think WTF they tell you \\"ok, don't worry, if that sounded like ancient chinese to you we'll be explaining it throughout the next few pages\\".<br /><br />The book is legitimately funny, the jokes are good ones, you'll be surprised at how subtle they may get sometimes.<br /><br />Also the questions that may arise at any given moment are asked by fictional students in the book and answered right there. It's like attending to a course where everyone is asking questions.<br /><br />It's the perfect book for starters on design patterns and also people like me who wanted to revisit them. If you know how to program on an OO language and don't know design patterns you're missing the big picture...

076115678X|5.0|This review is about how this book has effected me and also about some of the products made by the same people/company. I think that there are plenty of specifics about what the book contains, so this is my personal response. If you have had curls all you life this might not apply to you, but if you find yourself suddenly curly compliments of chemo, read on.<br /><br />To start with, let me explain that I really always wanted curly hair, and never had it naturally. I was the perm queen in the 80's (yes I am dating myself).  When I was diagnosed with cancer I had hair that was past my bra strap, and cut with the Presage method (a cut that adds curl). Anyway, after Chemo and Radiation when my hair started coming back curly, I was thrilled. Finally I would have those long beautiful curly locks I had spent so much time and money pursuing.  But wait, where were the beautiful locks? First I looked like my grandma (short frizzy helmet of hair) and then instead of growing longer, my hair grew out.... Straight out.  I was thinking a job at the local circus would be my best option.  One day after crying for about an hour (literally) I decided to quit feeling sorry for myself and do something about it. So I went to Amazon, and lo and behold I found this book.<br /><br />When my hair started growing out, it was a train wreck. After applying the information from the book, about 70% of the time people now ask me who does my hair or what I do to it (seriously-not making this up). I went from frizz to beautiful fat curls. If you are dealing with Chemo Curl, I highly recommend this book and the related products. Although there is a specific chapter about Chemo Curl, don't just read it, read the whole book (the Chemo chapter was somewhat disappointing to me).<br /><br />Obviously I am not going to tell you everything that this book says. If you are dealing with the same things that I was, I would suggest that the first thing that you do (while you are waiting for this book to arrive)is go out and get a microfiber towel. Stop using your normal towel to dry your hair!! I went ahead and bought the Deva Curl No Poo [[ASIN:B000NE6QP6 Deva Curl No Poo 32oz,Zero Lather Conditioning Cleanser]],  Deva Curl Low Poo [[ASIN:B001PHJSU0 DEVA by Deva Concepts CURL LOW POO ALL HAIR TYPES 32 OZ]] and Deva Curl conditioner [[ASIN:B000TK99NU Deva Curl Ultra Creamy  Daily Conditioner, One Condition, 32-Ounces]]. Although they all have pro's and cons, for a beginner like me they all were worth it. (I am going to try and do reviews on those when I get the time).<br /><br />To sum it up, after Chemo rather than buying a flat iron or a bunch of handkerchiefs, buy this book. It really helped me take a bad situation and turn it around. You don't realize how much you identify with your hair until you look in the mirror and hate what you see. Trust me, you have been thru enough already. Take those curls and own them. They are beautiful, maybe different, but definitely beautiful! By the way, Congratulation on getting those Chemo Curls, it means you are still here baby, still fighting!! You go with your beautiful self!!!
B001NJY56M|5.0|This album is amazing on CD, and it sounds so much better on vinyl. I've been an MCR fan from the beginning, and they continue to wow me, ten years in. It is rare to find this vinyl, and it is amazing and perfect! Better than most music in the world today. Nothing beats a good old song by My Chemical Romance!

B000OCY7JE|5.0|I kept seeing this title on Netflix, and keep steering away from it, as I was not pleased with a few movies I had seen from Sweden.  But, I came across it in the \\"A\\" section of the library and picked it up.  I was glad I did; otherwise I would have missed out on such a wonderful and beautiful drama.  It's not really a love story, it's a commitment to life, love for a family, and on one side, a deep love for children whose only family is the orphanage.<br /><br />The film draws you in slowly, first by its beauty from the happy faces at the orphanage, to the wealthy land and mansion of the super wealthy.  The story moves, guides you, takes you on a journey, has you thinking about the plot, and slowly, you are drawn into the reality.<br />With over two hours, it will keep you interested, wondering, deciding, and here see how a great storyline makes you think, accept, respond, only to offer something new to dwell on.<br /><br />Jacob Peterson, manager of an orphanage in India is summoned to Denmark to become a recipient of a monetary reward that will save the orphanage from financial ruin.  As he arrives in the midst of a wedding, he discovers that conditions come with the gift.<br /><br />Anna, an old flame is married to the multi-millionaire now, raising a beautiful young daughter who wedding is taking place.<br /><br />This is my first Susanne Bier film, characters were believable; storyline impressive, and the actors have done the characters justice.  The film was nominated for numerous awards, including the 2006 Best Foreign Film, but it lost to the German film.. [[ASIN:B000OVLBGC The Lives of Others]]...  After the Wedding is a remarkable film.  .....Rizzo
6305388458|4.0|This film was probably highly controversial in its day, mocking the life of Jesus. However, since then we've had years of South Park, Blazing Saddles, and other films pushing the edge. The film is not sacrilegious, though nowhere near respectful. And of course, it is light-hearted throughout.
B0079LJZG8|5.0|Some reviewers find this film slow and boring while I find it engrossing and suspenseful.  Most of us agree that the acting is first rate.<br /><br />Perhaps it is the times - things were more covert back then.  Today most things are \\"in your face\\" - including movies.<br /><br />One needs to focus on every minute of this film for it to make sense.  And, keep a close eye on Smiley's glasses to establish the timing.

030758836X|5.0|I loved this book. I will try not to repeat the same accolades from the other reviews: great characters, character-driven plot, clever use of point of view, the fun of unreliable narrators and unexpected twists.<br /><br />I have other aspects to praise:<br /><br />First, I want to rave about the language. The main-characters' voices are wonderfully vivid. The language is witty, figurative, and just plain fun. Flynn takes bad characters, and uses their \\"badness\\" to riff on the sounds of words, slang, funny and witty dialogue and wonderful figures of speech. The speech, like most well-written dialogue and first-person narration, distills (but does not mirror) real life, heightens it. The narration pulls us into the character's point of view.<br /><br />This book is a great surprise. I have started so many books where the writer proves they are not up to the job. For example, I started one suspense novel where a character felt afraid and the author wrote, \\"like a knife cutting into the back of his throat.\\" Then 20 pages later another character got frightened and the author wrote, \\"like a knife cutting...\\" Finally, thirty pages later, another character got frightened and the author wrote the same simile. I closed the book and never read the author again.<br /><br />Many genre books (and a lot of literary books) are badly written (self-consciously, pretentiously, or just plain stupidly). At least 3/4 of all best sellers seem created in the \\"produce lots of books, amp up the violent conflict, make lots of money\\" mode. Or else the writers can't write and their reader's don't know the difference. Give them bread, circuses and fictional gun battles. \\"Gone Girl\\" is leagues beyond most genre (and literary) novels. I could not find any negative style examples from Gone Girl, and about 1,000 positive examples. No words are waisted in this book.<br /><br />The second point I want to mention is about the unusual ending. (I'm trying not to give anything away.) This type of ending is considered anathema in a number of how-to writing courses. In those courses, the characters are supposed to be sympathetic and triumph, or supposed to be evil and get severely punished. Throughout this novel, the characters do not pull the reader in by being sympathetic (the reader is pulled in by great writing, great story and fascinating characters, not an outpouring of sympathy), or let the readers rejoice when their evil brings stern justice. Good! It's a type of ending that Hitchcock wanted to direct, but it was forbidden (popular-taste-wise) in his time. Could we really be more sophisticated?<br /><br />Third point: The characters are so vivid that we can see our own foibles, egotism and insecurity in them, even when they are loathsome. This character development is a real accomplishment. The vivid characterization is what pulls us in, with some empathy, but not much sympathy.<br /><br />The popularity of this book gives me faith in readers. Maybe we are actually getting smarter (collectively). I hope that this sophisticated novel flies to the top of the best seller list, that we all read it, and that we start demanding books of this quality (in genre and literary fiction).is considered anathema in a number of how-to writing courses.

B006GHA9QQ|4.0|I have watched \\"Love Never Dies\\" several times since buying the DVD and just finished reading quite a few of the reviews on Amazon.  Not surprisingly people seem to love or hate it but then one usually needs a strong opinion to be motivated to take the trouble of a review.  I would like to add a few thoughts of my own.<br /><br />I wonder if many people grasp that \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" is at its heart the story of the love of and sometimes obsession for music that most classical composers and performers possess.  \\"Love Never Dies\\" is simply a continuation of this story line.  For all its faults, in this it is successful.  The transfer of the characters may be less so.<br /><br />A number of reviewers have made much of the fact that the Phantom in \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" has declared himself denied the sins of the flesh and therefore would be unable to father children. I think it is reasonable to assume that he is simply referring to the repulsion that women would feel to his appearance not to some physical inability.  In fact, the use of a baritone voice makes the Phantom in \\"Love Never Dies\\" even more of a masculine, testosterone driven creature fully capable of being a passionate lover.  The one part of the continuation of the story that does not work though is that in \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" he was made a two time murderer.  I ran into a theatre goer recently who never noticed the bodies hanging from the rafters.  Perhaps the author wishes that to be the case for all of us. That Christine would love a murderer or that he would be worth loving just does not work.<br /><br />In \\"Phantom of the Opera\\", I found Raul nothing but a rich, reckless, self-important jerk so I can easily go with his now being a gambler and a drunk.  He treated Christian as so much arm candy, not believing her story of the Phantom, refusing to respect her fear of performing the Phantom's opera and never appreciating her talent or what it took. He does not acknowledge that like her father, a supposedly famous Swedish folk violinist, she too had real God given talent. So now in \\"Love Never Dies\\" the man has a wife whose musical passion he has denied and who lives with a secret about their son that she can never share.  Psychologically abandoned, Christine simply pours her love into her son.  I found the young actor who plays the son to be delightful even if his signature melody was a bit weird for a child.  He really succeeds in pulling together the under story of a father and son's love for one another. As for Madame Giry and Meg, it is not much of a stretch to see that they would assist and follow the Phantom.  But to Coney Island?<br /><br />I think Lloyd Webber says that at the turn of the century Coney Island was considered the eighth wonder of the world and that Freud said it was the only reason to visit American.  Hard to see this today and my big criticism of the cinema photography is that with their emphasis on close-ups of the principals, one cannot appreciate the stage setting that might place you there.  As for the stage settings themselves, they are in my opinion a bit too art deco in their lushness.  I certainly did not immediately get that what appeared to be a giant mirror in the hotel room was in fact supposed to be French doors leading to a balcony.  But otherwise they are wonderful in concept, color and lighting with the exception of a Christine all in blue against a too blue background singing the title song.<br /><br />Webber feels this is one of his better scores.  That it is good is without question.  Listen to it a few times and the tunes will be humming in your head.  I would like to see Hart polish up the lyrics a bit more.  I think the title song especially needs more works and needs to be sung by an operatic caliber soprano.  In fact I would like to hear most of it sung with operatic quality voices.  Along with other reviewers, my favorite was \\"Until I Hear You Sing Once More'.  Rather a shame it is the opening song as it setsthe bar too high for the rest.  I hope \\"Love Never Dies\\" does make it to a New York stage.

B007P3TMW2|5.0|This is a truly good movie to represent one of our darkest yet finest moments in our history.  All the people involved in Oskar's search came together to begin his healing.  The acting was very good for all the cast of great stand-out actors-Hanks,Bullock,Davis,VonSydow...but young Thomas Horn was amazing.  I selfishly hope that he devotes at least some of his considerable \\"smarts\\" to continue acting.  Acted as well as it was, it was difficult to watch and,yes, brought back the pain of 9/11 but was able to help us remember our togetherness and love for each other and community.

It has plenty of nice features, options and variety to keep you engaged and happy.  I like it very much.  Glad that it does not include OpenFeint or Pop-Up Ad for other apps like the  2.0 Version at the Google Play store.  If they update to that version here later with those negative annoyences, I will just not update it or maybe uninstall the app.  5 well deserved stars for now.  Hope they don,t ruin it later (ha-ha).
B000BT97AO|5.0|Puppetry art at it's most excellent! which you hardly ever get to experience anymore, except on stage or in centers.  Thank you, Ms. Henson and Company and cast, producer,etc., and a personal fave - Mr. Neal Gaiman...the artwork/sets/camera/editing collide to collude a phantasm.  It's ever so much more entertaining than my own dreams and nightmares.  When can we do it again?  A revival of allegorical fairy tales is just what the Bros Grimm would prescribe.  Our times are a lot weirder than theirs were!  More!

B006UG90RM|3.0|This isn't going to be a long in depth review.  If you loved Fair Warning, you should own this album.  That said, it's disappointing to me.  It's so close to being spectacular it makes me want to cry.  I waited months to rate the album hoping it would grow on me, but sadly it hasn't.  The production is sonically lacking and takes away from the experience.  Any one who could listen to 30 seconds of the remastered version of Fair Warning before listening to this album will notice the difference and it's staggering.  How can a 30 year old album sound better??? Dream Theater's latest sounds fine, so why can't this?  Are they just planning on a remastered version in a few years so they can make more money?  Do they figure everyone listens to low quality mp3s so why bother?  I want to like this album.  The songs themselves are above average. I just don't find myself listening to it much driving down road because it's just lacking the right sound.
B005O64VH8|5.0|People, please listen.  This is Secret Garden.  They're not your run-of-the-mill music.  They're deep.  The first time I listened to this CD I truly wasn't impressed.  Then I listened a second time.  Much better.  I was starting to really like this CD.  The third time through I fell in love with all but a couple of the songs.  You need to really LISTEN.  The songs will grow on you.  This has happened with every Secret Garden CD I own except White Stones.  (I fell in love with that one from the start.)<br /><br />Just listen THREE times (all the way through) without skipping songs.  Hear the entire song because if you don't, you'll miss the crescendo.  It's the BEST part of Secret Garden.<br /><br />Rolf is not \\"out of inspiration\\"!  He's just into his deepest compositions, which take a little more listening.  Don't give up on this CD right away!
B007L5KT76|1.0|I was going to buy the blu ray/rental combo for $22, but then I saw that it came with the ultraviolet \\"digital copy\\" and decided to rent the movie for $3.99 instead.<br /><br />When this movie is (if?) sold without ultraviolet, then I'll buy it. Ultraviolet is so grossly inept as a digital copy that it shouldn't even be called that. Having to create two accounts with two separate entities just to watch a movie (on approved devices only) I already have the disc for is asinine. What was wrong with the original digital copy that didn't require additional registering and I could transfer straight to Itunes/WMP? Bring the old digital copy back please.<br /><br />BTW, the movie was great. Get rid of ultraviolet.
B007FDE4Y8|3.0|Opteka steadyvid pro could have been a much much better product if small details had been paid attention to.<br />the biggest drawback of the unit is the poor craftsmanship of the \\"adjustment knob\\". The large tolerance of the bottom spar caused by poor build quality of the \\"adjustment knob\\" assembly made the unit impossible to balance, and made it loose balance every time i tried to move the unit side to side or lay it flat on a flat surface.<br />The assembly of the \\"adjustment knob\\" leaves a bad taste of poor chinese engineering.<br />I fixed the play by opening the \\"adjustment knob\\" and inserting a thin foil to take up the slack in the caliper, which was causing the unit to go out of balance.<br />Other than that , the gimble looks OK and works OK. The unit overall seems OK for the money.<br /><br />For 179USD, i would still expect a higher build quality from a product pretending to be a STABILIZER.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|What's so scary to me as I listen to this album is fostering the question,\\"What-if anything-could possibly be next?\\". When a band structures music in a way that carries whispers of past songs while achieving completely different sounds as skillfully as they have you have to scratch your head and wonder if this is \\"IT\\"...if this is what Ged described once in an interview,\\"...the perfect song,the perfect recording....\\",\\"...I don't think we've achieved that yet...\\"<br />Scary to think Clockwork may be a Swan Song.

0439023521|5.0|Well. I was already familiar with the book. I borrowed it from my daughter, read it, then put it away in a very safe place. Safe from everyone, including me. So I needed a copy because my wife wanted to read it and my daughter did want it back when we were through with it. It's very light reading since it was written for young folks but, it is a lot of fun. I enjoyed it immensely. I highly recommend it for everyone except the very young due to the extreme violence.<br />As for the seller, the book arrived promptly and the condition was just fine.<br />Of course, immediately after receiving it I found my daughters copy and was able to return it to her.

0439023491|4.0|In the Hunger Games, the heroine's dual character as both a beauty and a warrior led to an intriguing situation.  Actually, as I pointed out in my review of that book, there were nice analogies with the Illiad as a result of playing upon dual characteristics in human beings.  This, I believe, makes Hunger Games somewhat of a classic tale that possibly explains its huge appeal to some extent.  Furthermore, duality is very powerful, and obviously not confined to a tale like the Illiad.  We see a continuation of this ability to utilize duality in the second book of the series, Catching Fire.  This is quite a different type of book.  Nevertheless, it has intriguing facets, related to the dual character of the heroine, but also dualities in the other characters.<br /><br />As with the first volume, the narrative is simplistic and confined to a first person point of view from the main character.  This means the language is very accessible and appealing to teenagers, but I think that the story line also holds appeal for us older folk.  As a science fiction depiction of a dystopia, the story allows us to see extreme aspects of our culture through the lens of a projection into a rather depressing future.<br /><br />Three scenarios are developed in the book, each with its own ecology.  In one, the heroine dwells at the top of the hierarchy in her district, having won the hunger game she participated in.  Everything is highly constrained in this social world.  She would be very secure, and her future neatly packaged in an environment that would select a gender role for her primarily as mother and wife, and in which her skill as a warrior would be excluded.  Her role must be very passive.<br /><br />In the second ecosystem, the heroine is back in the gladiatorial arena, with her role as a warrior and beauty both emphasized.  In this niche, life is likely to be short, but she is using her dual abilities to their limits.  The environment is once again highly constraining, but merely to survive her role must be very active.<br /><br />A final niche, and one that is very discouraging for her, emerges toward the end of the book.  The ecosystem in which she is placed is now selecting for a role in which she is merely a pawn in a power game of others.  Perhaps this reveals something about the two previous roles as well.  We are left with a tantalizing sense of need for a resolution.<br /><br />I recommend this book, as an imaginary extrapolation of the life of this intriguing heroine.  Due to the violence depicted in the book, I am not sure that it would be suitable for a young person.  However, as an unfolding of this strange and terrifying world of the future, in which I believe we can see some aspects of our world, it is of interest.ely to survive her role must be very active.<br /><br />A final niche, and one that is very discouraging for her, emerges toward the end of the book.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|Asimov's Foundation series imagined a time when one man's genius could save the future. Whenever a crisis threatens the galaxy-wide civilization, a message from the past emerges exactly when needed and guides humanity safely through. Until it doesn't.<br /><br />In the Wool series, Hugh Howley's characters live lives that are less predicted than constructed. And like the Foundation universe, his world's people do not always follow their predicted path.<br /><br />Book one (there are now six: 1-5 form a continuous narrative; and number 6, a prequel) opens with a world-weary sheriff walking up to his deputy, turning in his badge, and committing a capital crime by speaking the forbidden phrase, \\"I want to go outside.\\" But why? Outside his office, in a large public space electronic windows show the \\"outside\\". It's a wind-swept, deadly landscape, devoid of color, of beauty, of life. The rotting corpses of capital criminals can be seen on the barren hills near the airlock. One of these corpses is the sheriff's wife. Does he want to join her in death and leave the misery of mourning?<br /><br />This is a mystery explored by the novel's most compelling character, a mechanic/engineer called Juliet. We aren't spared the sheriff's death. He is sent to \\"cleaning\\", the fate of all capital criminals.  Like the others, he puts on his death suit, one designed to keep him alive long enough to clean off the \\"silo's\\" sensors that provide the grim view. And like all the others, he cleans. No one knows why everyone cleans before death rather than angrily sitting down to die, or walking off to the ruined city in the distance, or tossing mud at the cameras. But they all do it.<br /><br />Juliette is an engineer and wants to know \\"why\\". She can't help but try to seek out the root of a problem and fix it.  The silo's giant generator has been a loud, inefficient mess as long as anyone can remember, but she fixes it using not only science but politics. Juliette, recruited to be the silo's next sheriff, takes to her job with energetic curiosity, the same sort of trait that increasingly seems deadly to others.<br /><br />Mysteries don't give up their secrets easily to Juliette. Tragedy follows the lives of all of the subterranean characters.  In this world, love is more often tragic than not, and like George R.R. Martin, Howley isn't afraid to deal out pain to characters he's made us love. And you will love them, but not all of them, and not without reservation. Death follows Juliette into her new job. Her first hours in office are strewn with the bodies of others who seem to have in common only a friendship with Juliette---and curiosity.<br /><br />The story wades compellingly into each mystery, digging deeper into the silo and into the world around it which may be more than it appears. It's a complicated world, where murder may save lives, and love may take them. Sometimes it seems as if the best one can hope for is a mediocre life with little sadness, but little joy.<br /><br />It is though a joy to read, a joy to follow these dangerous mysteries no matter how deadly they may be. From the first, you will be caught up in the lives of those you meet, you will want to follow them into the dark depths, into the deadly winds, and wherever else the story may take you.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|For those of you who are concerned about it being a hard to read military book, don't be. This book spends very little time discussing combat. The story starts out at his birth and much of the story covers Adam's childhood. This is one of the most inspirational and uplifting books I have ever read and will make you consider how you are living your own life, your patriotism, and your devotion to your family. Most of all, it will redefine your definition of Hero. It would make a great Fathers Day gift. I finished it in 2 days, I just couldn't put it down.

B0001NBMEE|5.0|Exiled Prince Valiant of Scandia travels to King Arthur's Camelot, finds the friendship of Sir Gawain, the enmity of the turncoat knight Sir Brak, romance, conflict and a singing sword!<br /><br />This is a wonderful movie I remember from childhood. It contrasts with the dark, profane, anti-hero garbage produced today by Hollywierd. This movie is bright, colorful with wonderful costumes and sets. I am struck by how good these old films truly are. Robert Wagner does a fair job of Valiant, Sterling Hayden is excellent as the veteran knight Gawain and James Mason gives a veteran performance in the role of the traitorous Sir Brak.<br /><br />This is the story of a young prince of Scandia living in exile who journeys to King Arthur's court in Camelot. Prince Valiant wishes to become a knight of the Round Table so he can help his father retake his throne in Scandia. Along the way, he is befriended and mentored by Sir Gawain, foremost knight of the Round Table. He is caught up in the treason of Sir Brak who masquerades as the \\"Black Knight\\" intent on usurping King Arthur and making common cause with the Vikings who deposed Valiant's father.<br /><br />There's lots of adventure, swordplay, battles, romance and honor to go around and a good time will be had by all who watch this great old film! I recommend this DVD with five stars!
0439023521|5.0|When I started the book, I thought.....this is not my type of book, which it wasn't.  But hey, I was stuck at the doctor for 2 hours and had nothing better to do.  Glad I kept reading because the book pulled me in and I ended you loving the book and the characters!
B002ZG97RE|4.0|Most of the negative reviews of this are that it doesn't follow a simplistic patriotic line.  Instead, in my view, it makes an attempt at realism, and it does make a political point:  that we were dupes to local pols and then were too cowardly and dishonest to admit it.  Sure, it is a political opinion, but what if it is true?<br /><br />Damon gives an excellent performance, though I couldn't judge the realism of the military experience and must trust the other reviewers.  It is suspenseful, scary, and moving.  His personal quest - to figure out where the claims of WMD came from after he can't find them - is completely believable.  Another aspect I liked was how hard it was on the press:  rather than simple heros, they were flawed as well, duped by the administration and ashamed of it.  Damon's American adversaries were believable brutes, if brave in their own ways.  Finally, the Iraki Freddie, a helper who goes his own way in important details, was a very interesting twist.<br /><br />This is up there with Syriana, you can see the complexity of what we have gotten ourselves into.  Recommended.

0375842209|5.0|I dont uaually write reviews but this book surprised me.  It started off a little odd and slow, i wasnt sure if I was going to finish it. Boy am I glad I did. It has become one of the best books I have ever read.  It has stayed with me for quite some time now after reading it. Thinking back on some of the scenes and quotes presented in the book quite frankly warm my heart and fill my soul.  The book Thief was well worth the read!
1603427244|3.0|I've given this three stars for two reasons:<br /><br />1 - It's not as comprehensive as Montse Stanley's coverage of cast-ons and cast-offs.<br />2 - The format of this book is TOO small, making the rather limited \\"step-by-step\\" illustrations and the dark yarn colors nearly useless.<br /><br />Stick to the Reader's Digest handbook by Montse Stanley ... It's far better in terms of pure technique (though the drawn illustrations are rather dated).

B004FGFQBS|1.0|SPOILER ALERT:  In the original ending Ripley grabbed the Alien Queen as she was bursting from her chest, and dragged her into the molten lead.  It was the most memorable part of the whole movie.  In the Special Edition, they edited this out.  The stupidity of this is inexplicable, and unexpected or I never would have wasted my money buying this video.  I am disgusted and appalled, and feel robbed.

B003Y5HWMW|4.0|I guess I arrived a bit late to the party, but man, what a time I've had with this show. I heard about it but never watched it, my wife an avid book reader was reading the books, and knowing that I hardly read instruction manuals, recommended on buying the show on blu-ray, so I decided to get it for my birthday which is actually in two weeks...WWWWWOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWW... loved the show, great story, great surprises, can't wait for the second seadon to come out in blu-ray.<br /><br />Now the only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating it's because of the loading issues most of us are having, my loading problems started on disc 3 episode 8, the weird thing is that the day before I got to watch episode 7 on the same disc and  the next day it wouldn't work and it froze my Sony Blu-ray player, so after unplugging it and getting the disc out, I tried it on my PS3 slim and it worked fine, it even loaded faster. Afer reading most of the reviews to see if I could find a solution on the rating given by:<br /><br />Use Disc 1 Menu to Select Episodes, March 18, 2012<br />By<br />R. Wolfe (Philadelphia, PA)<br /><br />I found out it's all in the use of the menu on disc 1, which it's a bit of a work, but it seems to solve the problem, he even mentions that once your on the menu of another disc you can do the same, another thing that helps it's erasing the memory data either on the player or the rear usb memory stick, if you have one. I guess that the anti-piracy measures are a bit strict on our players, I guess that's why you have to use the menus to load up the episodes.<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />WINTER IS COMING!!!!!!!
055357342X|5.0|A Storm of Swords and a Dance with Dragons are my favorite books in the Game of Thrones series. If you're stuck in a \\"readin rut\\" with typical fair maidens, mustache twirling villians, and good always truimphing over evil then George R.R. Martin is perfect. I love how unpredicatable it is. You think you have it figured out then BOOM you're jaw is on the floor. I literally would find myself pacing from anticipation and horror, or gasping out with surprise! As always I love Sansa, Tyrion, and in this book Davos... READ! READ! READ!
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|It hurts to give such a negative review about a film with my favorite actor.  Unfortunately Liam had to know after reading the script that this was a film being created that would only be a win for him.  So often this happens with actors who have achieved great success that they begin to lower their standards for the right film, the right script.  This was one of the poorest films I have ever seen.  The 'F' word used in every sentence and sometimes multiple times, only because the writer could not do a better job.  The realism of their plight was lacking, some of the wolves looked fake, all in all I would like my money back.  I'll watch 'Taken' again and remind myself that Liam Neeson is still a great actor, however in the future will not buy one of his films without seeing some of the reviews.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|I took a brief glance at some of the reviews before I set in to read Wise Man's Fear and was a bit disheartened to see some negative ones. When I started reading, however, my thoughts were \\"Psh, those people don't know what they're talking about. This doesn't drag at all and isn't messy!\\"<br /><br />It does start getting a bit messy after the 60% mark, though. So much happens in the last part of the book that it made my head spin a bit. There were some truly throwaway parts, particularly where Kvothe encounters Felurian. I also didn't care for Kvothe's excursion to Ademre, not just because of its divergence from what I felt was the main plot, but because it didn't feel realistic and felt too rushed. After everything that happens in this story, I feel a bit gobsmacked that barely a year passed during most of the events. It felt more like years upon years.<br /><br />But all said and done, I finished this feeling pretty satisfied. We don't necessarily see much of the Chandrian, but we do find out why people hesitate so much to even talk of them. I have enjoyed Kvothe's adventures at the University and I'm not looking forward to the end of those. But if Rothfuss sticks to Severen-like adult adventures instead of Ademre/Felurian-like adventures, I will be pleased enough when Kvothe does eventually leave.<br /><br />I am excited about the third book and eager to find out more about Kvothe's current world, how he met Bast, and what the deal is with those creepy spiders! Oh, and to see how things go with Denna, of course.
B003OWVHVC|4.0|I had never heard of Aloe Blacc until earlier this year when I was playing one of the free CDs that comes with MOJO magazine and on the CD of Rolling Stones covers tunes, one track, \\"I Got the Blues,\\" was sung by Aloe Blacc. Wow! What a voice. He definitely has one of those powerful yet melodic voices that turns heads and commands your attention. It's got that old school 70s vibe to it, but yet with a modern sheen. I keep trying to think of someone else that he reminds me of, but nobody else really compares. It's not that Blaac's voice is that unusual or anything, but it is distinctive. As for this album, it's a very good one, mixing soulful originals with surprising effective covers such as the Velvet Underground's \\"Femme Fatale.\\" This guy really digs deep into the emotional vault and pours out the soul. Fans of 70s and 80s soul should really dig this album. This guy is going places.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really like this game. It is nice to pass the time. The only thing that I do not like about the game is the hints. They are not usually helpful.
B001TCHDPS|4.0|This second \\"long lost\\" album by Rodriquez is another keeper, but overall I found it less riveting than his debut, \\"Cold Fact.\\" Once again, the highlights are the song lyrics; thoughtful, thought-provoking, daring, beautiful. Others have called him a poet and that's pretty accurate. While Rodriquez does has a flair for words, sometimes the melodies of his tunes don't always match the memorability of his lyrics. But there ARE some catchy songs on this album and the overall feel is perhaps more pop oriented than the first album. If you are curious about this guy and all the recent hype, I'd suggest getting \\"Cold Fact\\" before this one. If you like that album, you should find this one appealing also.
B004EPYZSK|4.0|Cowboys and aliens(released July/11)is,to me,a surprisingly good Sci-Fi film.It's reviews were not the greatest and I was anticipating watching a high budget movie with good intentions that went no where fast.But such was not the case,which leads me to mention the first rule of reviewing:Don't believe what others see and write about,believe only what YOU see! Mr.Spielberg had a hand in this epic,which truly IS one,in feel and looks.The cinematography is fabulous as we are taken all over the beautiful outlands of Arizona.But let's not get ahead of ourselves,let's look at the films storyline.<br />The film begins out in the desert near a town called Absolution.A man(Daniel Craig) wakes up on the desert floor with a wound in his side and no idea how he got there.On his left wrist is an over sized \\"bracelet\\" of some type,origin unknown.Some drifters come through and decide he may be a wanted man.Before they can take him into town for the reward the man takes down all three and wanders alone into Absolution.<br />While there it seems some of the townsfolk know him,specifically the sheriff.It seems this stranger is a wanted felon by the name of Jake Lonergan.After the son of a local prominent cattle rancher,Mr.Dollarhyde(Harrison Ford),accidentally shoots a deputy sheriff,both are taken into custody and put into a wagon for shipment to and a trial at Tuscon.Before they can leave Dollarhyde shows up for his boy but is interrupted by a group of strange lights approaching the town.The lights turn out to be alien craft intent on abducting some of the townspeople.Lonergan's bracelet comes to \\"life\\" and he is soon shooting at and downing at least one of the ships.However the alien pilot escapes and roams into town only to be shot and wounded.<br />Lonergan leaves town while Dollarhyde forms a posse which heads out at first light to track down the creature.Lonnergan arrives at a cabin in which he gets flashbacks.He has had them previously but they grow more detailed and this one reveals his former love and some gold he brought home.in the flashback the gold suddenly melts on the table and is sucked upwards while his lady love gets pulled right out of the cabin.<br />Lonnergan leaves the cabin and joins up with Dollarhyde and his men.A ways out they run into a gang of robbers that turn out to be Lonnergan's old gang members.They take him to their camp and a confrontation occurs between Lonnergan and the new boss.It doesn't go down well for Lonnergan who eventually has to use to bracelet to help them all escape.Traveling further on the party gets captured by some Apache Indians.Through some harrowing moments a consensus is finally reached between the two groups to fight the invaders.Through more concise flashbacks Lonnergan now knows and leads them all to the place where the alien mother ship is buried.<br />A pitched battle between the aliens and Lonnergan,Dollarhyde and company begins.Entry is gained into the ship and eventually many of the taken settlers are found and released.Near the end the ship lifts off but is finally destroyed only about a thousand or so feet above the ground.Back in Absolution Lonnergan is asked to stay on by Dollarhyde while the sheriff pretends Lonnergan had died in the firefight.Lonnergan begs off both and leaves town.Fade out in typical western fashion.<br />As I mentioned before this film simply looks beautiful.The scenes in the desert are stunning and epic in their look.Something out of a John Ford film.The script has just enough twists and turns in it to keep one interested throughout its journey on the screen.Lonnergan's flashbacks(a tool as old as Pete the Pup)is done just right,I find.The acting is also spot on as we have a great cast of starring and supporting actors on hand.The special effects are also of the highest quality as the aliens are all too real looking.They are bipeds,whose smallish heads meld into their necks,and whose chests open up to reveal two hands,with three E.T. like digits.The fightsequences between humans and aliens are also very realistic and deadly looking.These things aren't on Earth for a game of backgammon.<br />Technically speaking the film looks great in its original a/r of 2:40:1.Extras include three featurettes and commentary by the director.<br />All in all a very enjoyable blend of the old fashioned western with a Sci-Fi backdrop.It has an epic feel and look to it and the acting along with the special effects are very good.Recommended.sequences between humans and aliens are also very realistic and deadly looking.These things aren't on Earth for a game of backgammon.<br />Technically speaking the film looks great in its original a/r of 2:40:1.Extras include three featurettes and commentary by the director.<br />All in all a very enjoyable blend of the old fashioned western with a Sci-Fi backdrop.It has an epic feel and look to it and the acting along with the special effects are very good.Recommended.

0684847248|5.0|I read this book over 15 years ago and still vividly remember many lessons from this book.  I have shared my copy and purchased a few copies for people I know who are going through difficult times in their lives and may be asking \\"why me?\\"  Paraphrasing the first line of the book, \\"life is meant to be hard and once you realize that, life is not so hard anymore,\\" reminds me whenever life is challenging me that I will be ok and make it through this challenging time and hopefully learn so good life lessons when I get to the otherside.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone seeking out information on why things happen, why are we here, and why me?

B005LAIHQS|3.0|Will Smith's sun has dimmed in recent years, and it doesn't help that we haven't seen an M.I.B. film in a decade, so the buzz on the franchise has waned some. Still, I got mad love for the Men in Black and wasn't about to pass up on this third installment. And, it turns out, my faith is redeemed... but with a caveat or three. The franchise still has legs, but now you can spot them varicose veins.<br /><br />It's not the worst thing in the world if the script isn't finished even though the film is already shooting. CASABLANCA, for one, famously managed to steer itself straight even though the writers were still scrambling days into the final shoot. But if you've just seen MEN IN BLACK 3 and you're nursing this sense of disconnect and discontent, then, yes, do blame the screwy script. For one thing, Tommy Lee Jones, who only had several weeks to shoot his scenes in the can, probably remained clueless as to how the plot ultimately unwinds. Place his lackluster performance - and the fact that he seemed so unengaged - on that doorstep. When all's said and done, Tommy Lee Jones' minimal appearance essentially amounts to a glorified guest spot.<br /><br />Agent J (Smith) wakes up one morning to rewritten history and to an alarming new obsession with chocolate milk. He discovers that his partner K (Jones) had ceased to exist in the present day, that K, forty years ago, was fatally gunned down by Boris the Animal, a world conqueror who is the last of his malevolent race. To reset the timeline, J promptly time travels to 1969, and so we're treated to a terrific time jump sequence. And even though it's only peripherally relevant to what actually goes down in the the narrative, J is also trying to prevent a massive alien invasion. Although, by now, chances are that residents of the Big Apple merely roll their eyes at yet another hostile alien armada menacing their cityscape.<br /><br />On July 15, 1969 - the day before the historic Apollo moon launch - J meets a decades more youthful K (Josh Brolin), and by \\"meets\\" I, of course, mean \\"is arrested by.\\" K doubts J's M.I.B. credentials, but then credit J's convincing gift for gab. It prevents his exposure to 1969's humongous version of the neurolizer. Off they go then on a hunt for Boris the Animal, with J stealing fascinated glances at his new/old partner. At this stage, K is 29 years old, although he still exhibits that weathered look, still craggy-faced, still laconic and impassive. \\"You got some city miles on you,\\" remarks J. Like you, I'm mouthing the line along with Will Smith, because I saw the trailer.<br /><br />General concensus suggests that MEN IN BLACK 3 does improve on the sequel but pales under comparison to the original. From there on, opinions vary. Some call MEN IN BLACK 3 a return to form. Some can't get past the flaws. Me, I lean towards favoring it more so than not, but there are issues.<br /><br />It's a bit of a shock to learn it's been four years since Will Smith was in a feature film. It's gratifying that he can still channel the cool Fresh Prince persona. His past four pictures had restricted him to more somber roles. But Smith still has that old magic. He simply oozes charm. But he doesn't own this movie.<br /><br />Josh Brolin owns this movie. His impersonation of Tommy Lee Jones' terse Texas drawl is freakin' uncanny. He captures Jones' delivery perfectly, and his demeanor. Brolin develops a more fun-loving side to K. Another character I enjoyed is Griffin the alien clairvoyant (Michael Stuhlbarg, bringing a puppy-like charm). Griffin has a knack for glimpsing multiple futures, and he has good moments in which he fusses and tries to determine which version of the future is currently  unfolding. Thankfully, the film doesn't overdo these bits.<br /><br />The plot and premise are tantalizing enough that it's all the more of a gut punch when bits of the movie fail to come together. There were moments in which I was bored. Emma Thompson steps in as the new M.I.B. director, Agent O, with Alice Eve playing her younger counterpart in 1969. There's a romance that is early on implied between Agents O and K, except that both Thompson and Eve end up mostly sidelined, and so that plot thread really never does get picked at. And I miss Zed. Sucks that Rip Torn was having so much legal trouble, he had to be written out of the story.<br /><br />The stuff I liked? I got a kick out of the \\"Andy Warhol\\" scene. And I thought they did a fantastic job of visualizing the 1969 setting. I liked that they didn't shy away from addressing the existing racism of that era. It's a bit of an irony that, in 1969, when those cops get their profiling on and pull J over, that J actually did just boost his ride. It's a really fun sequence. So, yeah, the scenes that they get right, they get amazingly right. Ultimately, though, the payoff isn't there. One ongoing beat has J time and again harping on what made K into such a closed off, hardened soul. This is answered in the climax, during a big reveal. But it's a reveal that comes out of left field and feels so forced. It sours the film that much more for me. And I still can't wrap my head around that stunt J pulls in Cape Canaveral while wrestling with the big bad.<br /><br />I still recommend MEN IN BLACK 3, strained though it is. I'm still liking the M.I.B. universe, and how strange it is and the level of imagination that goes into constructing it. Will Smith creates a nice chemistry with Brolin, and it's nice to see Smith back to being the fun-having Will Smith, instead of the morose Academy Award Will Smith. We still get those scenes in which the most fun lies in checking out the cool background details, because Sonnenfeld and his creative team reward us with those outlandish little sight gags. Clunky futuristic jet packs, sweet gyrobikes, graffiti aliens, a slightly more lighthearted K... Even after fourteen years on the job and now a Class 1 Senior Agent, J still hasn't seen it all. And neither have we. I'm banking on a third sequel. Here come the MEN IN BLACK 4. Na na na na na-na-na...ctor, Agent O, with Alice Eve playing her younger counterpart in 1969.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I give the story 3 stars for the tolerable writing and the author's failure to break out a thesaurus. She uses the same phrases and descriptive words for every action and reaction over and over again in every single chapter. Like one other reviewer said, you can turn reading this book into a drinking game.<br /><br />Aside from that, the story isn't half bad. I can understand why so many people (mostly women) are drawn to it. It's fantasy that could sort of become a reality for a very lucky girl...and the sex is super hot and steamy. A story with BDSM in it is not something I am normally interested in reading, but I decided to hop on the band wagon for this book since I believe there will be a movie in the works soon enough. I know the author sold the movie rights already, so I'm looking forward to seeing it come to life. Anyway, the BDSM seemed pretty tame in this first installment. Only a couple visits to the red room of pain, and there was some enjoyable spanking and a few toys or tools but nothing too crazy or weird. Now, I say the writing is tolerable, and that is true of most of the book, but when it comes to the sex scenes, the author really knows how to get you going as the reader...I was definitely mostly satisfied with her writing in those parts. I found myself drawn to Christian and getting a little excited about what he might do next in the bedroom, bathroom, red room, etc. He's hot! I imagine an actor like Chris Pine (from the new Star Trek movie) or Matt Bomer (from TV's White Collar) playing Christian in the movie.<br /><br />I think another reason this book does so well is that it's not just about the sex, there really is a story unfolding here with the romance between the main characters and within the characters themselves. They each have their own hangups. Anna has issues with all the weird sex stuff and her odd relationship with Christian, and Christian has issues with allowing himself to be more open with Anna because of some past issues of which this first book only skims the surface. The author certainly leaves you hanging at the end of book one. Obviously she wants you to buy the next book. I don't know if I will do that yet, but thinking about Christian Grey and what he might do next in the red room of pain kind of gets me thinking I might just hit the 'Buy Now' button on my Kindle soon. ;)h this first book only skims the surface.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like this game. Since I have been playing there hasn't been any glitches. one thing that is annoying is the King Fu game. Even if you get a perfect score, the reward is only 1000 coins and that doesn't. buy much in the game.
B0077SGMXM|1.0|turned my screen off while playing and it was incredibly slow to unlock when turning back on. had this problem repeatedly. app itself is meh so i uninstalled. I've never had such a problem before and my phone is no wimp (galaxy nexus). after uninstall my phone had no further problems. there's no excuse for an application to cause problems like that. it should never have made it to the market let alone become the faotd.
B004TJ1H32|5.0|It's Space Balls you get whats expected. A lol comedy that never gets old and never stops being funny. Other Mel Brooks movies worth seeing are Young Frankenstein, Blazing Saddles, Robin Hood Men in tights and Dracula Dead and loving it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|awesome game.... fun for hours.... its a family friendly game that any age can play! Its the luck of the Irish! GO IRELAND!
B0086700CM|5.0|Every person should get this game then write a review with five stars!!!  I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH...<br />:)
B0052VUNHC|2.0|Although I found this to be an easy read, it was disturbing and often unrealistic. Disturbing for the violence, alcohol abuse and dysfunctional relationships. Unrealistic for the portrayal of college life.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Got the first few seasons free thanks to my prime membership.  Like the show so much that I had to buy the next season.  I cant wait for the new season to come out on streaming.  Cons:  Might be cheaper to find a box set and just watch via dvd.
B0072X2NUS|5.0|30 years ago Vince Clarke had a mental breakdown of sorts and decided to leave Depeche Mode.  Martin Gore took over as the main songwriter, and the rest is history.  Vince has managed to have a very successful career in his own right with Yazoo (Yaz) and Erausure.  The thing both these guys have in common is their passion for electronic music and synthesizers.  Looking over the last thirty plus years it should become very clear that there has not been anyone as prolific in the electronic genre as these two.  To put it lightly, they are geniuses.<br /><br />Forget that this is techno, just listen with an open mind.  If you already like techno, you are sure to be blown away.  This album is pure mastery.  There has never been a better techno album put out.  The expectations, including my own, were quite high and by golly they delivered!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Just as my folding goes with me, so does this handy Pocket Pal multi-sharpener. All it takes a  couple of quick swipes through and viola (!) I've got the keen edge right back. The added mini steel further enhances the cutting edge. I never leave home without it!
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I have never before really thought about wearing a watch but with my recent promotion at work I figured I would dress the part. I am not big on jewelry but there is something about a watch that completes a professional look. At first I was disappointed that it was not keeping time correctly but I was told to wear it more consistently and let it wind itself up and have had no issues since. I traded out the band for a brown croc stamped leather band and it really looks great. The dial is a nice sage green that compliments other colors well and it is just the right size not overpowering my wrist. I am a happy customer.
B007NZDES0|5.0|I was given the DVD/CD package as a gift for Father's Day; first thing I did was rip the CD to my mp3 player. All the titles came up in Turkish; the artist listed is Korey Candemir who released an album in 2001 called Sade - no relation to this Sade's music. All the music is correct but I had to rename the files and redo all the mp3 tags; anyone else have this happen to them? Is this a Sony / Epic snafu for all of the CDs or do I have a rarity?
B004VMUS9G|5.0|when I use this on car trips or camping, it is just great!!And it also wakes me up greatly! awesome!!
B005LAIGOQ|3.0|The Woman in Black film version pales in comparison to the book by Susan Hill, as it not only uses typical Hollywood gimmicks to get scares, but has deficiencies that lessen the creepiness factor. The biggest problem in the film is that everything is obvious, blatant and upfront, given to us in the initial stages of the film on a silver platter so we know what to expect. There's little in the way of true build up to give any heightened suspense; they just kind of rush Kipps (played by Daniel Radcliffe) to the house as soon as possible, and then the residents and locals try to rush him out of the house. Another problem is simply that we don't quite get into the head of Kipps as much in the film. Seeing things from his perspective as he sees them--as he slowly realizes the history of the house and the woman-- makes the novel much more effectively atmospheric, something not accomplished as well in this film. There are a few scares scattered a few places, and the story does come into focus aptly in the second part, especially as he finds out the woman's history, but mainly this film just felt too rushed and lacks any subtlety.<br /><br />I think you are better off checking out the other version of The Woman in Black, [[ASIN:B00004UEEU Woman in Black]]. That is, renting it, as the sellers are asking outrageous prices for that version.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love it because I think the game is going to give me something for free if I do this so in reality I don't like how hard it is to get cash in the game I think they should make it easier but that's just my opinion
0385738757|3.0|-  This book made me angry!  So many twists!  So many questions without answers!  Come on Dashner!!  Give me something!<br /><br />-  There were some serious graphic scenes in this book!  I hope they never turn this into a movie, cause I won't be able to stomach seeing some of this stuff.<br /><br />-  The book turned into a Zombie book.  Didn't see that coming.<br /><br />-  I don't know who to trust or what the heck is going on!<br /><br />-  The jargon didn't bug me as much in this one.  It wasn't as prominent.<br /><br />-  The first half of the book was a little slow for me, but the 2nd half really picks up.<br /><br />-  Thomas...what will become of you!!<br /><br />-  A love triangle?  Really?  I was not expecting that.<br /><br />-  I wasn't expecting any of it really.  This series is crazy!!<br /><br />-  I really can't decide how I feel about this book.  I liked it, but I hated it.  Things better wrap up all nicely with lots and lots of answers in the last book.<br />[...]
B007R41E8O|5.0|I like this music when I work out. It keeps me motivated. Lots of variety. It is long enough to where I don't have to repaeat the same songs with every workout.
B0086700CM|4.0|um I tried downloading this on my kindle but supposedly there is an error....otherwise ive seen people play this and it looks fun so 4 is what I rate
B006OCM0G0|4.0|so its really great addicting game only thing be careful when it comes to buying gems and coins because it cost real money other than that its awesome
B005Q1W10A|5.0|You won't be sorry.  Great story and characters.  Julian Fellowes outdid himself writing this, is presently working on Season 3.......and Julian there had better be a Season 4,5,6,7 at the very least.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game its so much fun and I played this on my brothers I pod touch but its so much better on my device. You should get this game.  :)
B007SYWFRM|5.0|very entertaining and fun it will draw you in I am very happy with it I will recommend it to all of my friends easy to play.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|I picked up a physical copy of this book at Wal-Mart when it first came out because the premise behind it was interesting. From the time I opened it, I was hooked! Since then, I have read all of the author's books and e-books and continue to be more enchanted and involved with each story. I absolutely cannot wait for her next book in November, let alone her next e-novella.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|its a great tool to start your child in learning how to learn play chess. I enjoy it myself very much. thanks &amp; the best part its free to entertain yourself anywhere. if you want perfectly genius... pay!!! in my days these devices didn't exist &amp; we played with a cardboard colored with crayons &amp; rocks. this is a great app!!!!!!!!!
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|Loved this book.  I like the reality of their past and how it affects them now. The romance is great and the characters are very interesting and easy to like and relate to.
B005LAIGW8|1.0|Im shocked at some of the people that really liked this film. It is a bore! And terribly made.<br /><br />The only thing i liked was the Ghost Rider design (except, the missing spikes on the jacket) and special effects.<br /><br />Everything else:  the script/story, direction and acting were all horrible. The shaky-cam/hand-held stuff simply does not work and belong in a movie like this.<br /><br />If you saw the trailers, you saw the movie. There are no surprises or new cool action moments.<br /><br />The image of Ghost Rider urinating fire, illustrates my opinion on the film, perfectly.<br /><br />Dont waste your time and money on this. Worst, than the first lame film.
B008469DGY|3.0|it does the stupidest things sometimes and it is very agervateing but sometimes it does how i want it to
B0040JBAMY|5.0|This CD set was a great purchase and allowed me to get all the songs I love from Queen including favorites Somebody to Love, Bicycle, etc.
B000JQUZCI|4.0|I'm glad I finally got around to reading this.  After years of only knowing the movies, this was a real pleasure.  And I highly recommend following it up with Fred Saberhagen's \\"The Frankenstein Papers\\".  A treat to follow this with.[[ASIN:0812551729 The Frankenstein Papers]]
B0086700CM|5.0|best it slowed me down a bit but it started again so I thought might as well give it a five star reveiw
B006XF5BTG|5.0|GREAT BOOK! This book is easy to read and comprehend and has a lot of great information. I suggest reading all the way through once and then re-reading it and taking notes. I am looking forward to reading his other books.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|If I could give it zero stars, I would. The story is unbelievable, the characters are one dimensional and ridiculous. Seriously... this author sounds like a 15 year old writing out her wildest fantasies. The main man is a manipulative and abusive prick, and the main woman is a ridiculous twit who orgasms by him just looking at her.<br />This woman wrote a \\"romance\\" novel with one of the most abusive men anyone could have ever created.<br />It was revolting and disgusting, and I CANNOT BELIEVE that so many people think this is romantic and sweet and even remotely a good story.<br />So, so, so bad.<br />When I say abusive I do not mean the BDSM part because I understand that is a lifestyle and some people get their willies from that... but his entire personality is one that any woman with enough sense (meaning in real life) would get the hell out of there and not look back. DON'T BOTHER reading this trash.
B0086213XW|1.0|good cast, horrible film.  no point, no plot, no closure.  it's like watching a home video of people you don't know.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is greatest thing I ever used in a mobile device like my kindle fire. best of all it has its ways of getting to you for the better and is a great supporter spiritually
B005IQZB14|5.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK!  I bought it before it became the Oprah Book Club choice.  Yes, it is a book about hiking, but it is also about the author taking this particular journey because she felt compelled to and felt she could not fail at one more thing.<br /><br />Aside from her hike on the PCT, she takes the reader back to what brought her to this point in her life - her mother's death from cancer, her upbringing, her family, and all the decisions she made that brought her to that trail.<br /><br />She inspired me to hike. I don't hike. I don't exercise, but a part of me wants to experience her bravery and to take a journey similar to hers.<br /><br />One of the best books I've ever read in my life.  I read in via Kindle, but I will buy the book to add to my library of favorite books.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|One of the best books that I have read in a long time.  I couldn't put it down.  Amazon Kindle has an amazing library and I would recommend to anyone thinking about purchasing a kindle or using the Ipad app to start with the Hunger Games Trilogy. Thank you.
0345803493|5.0|This was the best book in the series!  Usually the second book in the series is a bit of a let down, but for the most part it was great from start to finish.  More action, story, and while there is still a lot of sex, there isn't as much detail as in the first book.  I mean, how many times can you explain a sexual experience, it gets a bit repetitive (especially in the way which she explains everything).  I read a lot of lukewarm reviews for the second book, and while I was disappointed, I was already hooked from the first book, so I knew I would read it regardless. Enjoy.
B0086700CM|4.0|ya its a cool app like it just takes forever to load though but other then that ya ok app ..............
B0086700CM|5.0|love this one very fun<br />would recommend for every one play for hours never gets boring.  would like to see more like it!!!!!!
B001JQM7TG|5.0|Buy it.<br />Read it.<br />Do what it says.<br />Read it some more.<br />Continue doing what it says.<br />Read it more.<br />Keep doing what it says.<br />P-O-W-E-R-F-U-L  stuff.
B005I4JG80|5.0|As an anxiety ridden first time Mom, reading this book really helped put all the social pressures and over abundance of information we have in America in to perspective for me.  Obviously, we do a lot of things right in America with rearing our children but there is definitely something to be said about expanding our knowledge to other cultures.  I have always felt your life shouldn't \\"end\\" when you have kids and this feeling was reinforced while reading how the French seem to find a much better balance between adult/relationship time and kid/family time.  To any Mom or Soon-To-Be-Mom that feels inendated with all the clashing parenting views and rearing how-tos, you need to read this book!
B00881VLCE|5.0|it's hard to find a User friendly puzzle game! I would highly recommend this to anyone that's looking for a game to pass the time
0345803485|5.0|Loved this book could not put it down.  How soon can I get the next two?  Where can I buy them?
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I am enjoying the easy access of all that Kindle has to offer.  I am learning as I go with all that is available
B008764ZQ4|5.0|If you were in high school / college during the '80's, you must see this movie and buy the soundtrack.  Top notch entertainment.  And all of the songs (except for Undercover Love) are excellent.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|So I thought that this would be a typical sequel. Everybody cashing in on a franchise etc etc. But lo and behold, twas different. Excellent movie! Downey was very good. At this point, I'll watch anything with him in it since he's acting at a different, much more interesting level than everyone else. (Saw the Avengers and Downey made the movie. Same thing here.) Jude Law was also good, but maybe a bit under-utilized. Would strongly recommend renting this movie. Definitely worth the price of admission.
0061714372|5.0|I've heard stories in magazines and seen interviews on TV shows about how hard musicians had it coming up in the world and achieving the All-Star Recognition everyone dreams of attaining. I would have never imagined that Dave Mustaine suffered the tragic childhood that he did, let alone be brave enough to confess and document everything in a book to share with the world. He had an absent father, lived life as a drug dealer, and suffered years of alcoholism and drug abuse. And that's all before he started being a musician! It's amazing that he survived knowing how horrible his early life was, but it's also heartwarming knowing that he eventually kicked all of his habits, became sober, and lived to be one of the most influential musicians in Rock and Heavy Metal History. If you're a fan of Megadeth, Heavy Metal, or musicians, you should buy this book and take a dive into the life of Dave Mustaine. It has the similar outcome of a risen music legend, but it has a totally different way of getting there.
B000002L9Y|5.0|Tango In The Night is the fourteenth original album released in 1987 by the UK pop rock band best known by its superhit album THE RUMOR in 1977 . This was also the last album that the band's key members Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks, and Christine McVie got together. After the band released MIRAGE in 1982, the band broke apart and each member released their solo albums. Particularly Stevie Nicks made successful albums one after another. So the news that the band would make a new album with three main members together was just incredible for music fans at that time and it turned out to be a nice way to celebrate the band's 20th anniversary.<br /><br />Indeed the album is filled with such festive mood, enough to blow away the scandals around them. Lindsey's made a great job to organize three different talents' works and put them together as a consistent album and not just the sums of their solo works. Particularly BIG LOVE and the last track YOU AND I PART II share the same rhythm giving the album lasting impression after listening. Although the vocal performance of Christine McVie is brilliant particularly LITTLE LIES and EVERYWHERE, Stevie Nicks also did great in SEVEN WONDERS and WELCOME TO THE ROOM, SARA. I wish Stevie had more participation in this one. TANGO  IN THE NIGHT tries Latin rock approach. Non-hit tracks such as CAROLINE, MYSTIFIED, and FAMILY MAN are also excellent. Unfortunately after the album release Lindsey left the band and the albums after that such as BEHIND THE TUSK(1990), TIME(1995), and SAY YOU WILL(2003) never won the appreciation as much as this work had.<br /><br />Verdict: Last of Great Line-up. Very enjoyable.<br />Rating: 95 out of 100<br />Recommended for: 80s pop rock fans.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Well there's not much I can say about these books that has not been said before. I guess \\"believe the hype\\" is all I can say. I fully expect the Wool series to become a science fiction classic.
B005OCHOZS|4.0|As a vegetarian and an ultra runner, I have been waiting anxiously for this book.  I have known for years that you can run and be active and eat veggies to do it.  Scott does a great job of giving some insight into the two passions, running and diet, without it coming across as egotistical.<br />The book covers Scott's life from a young boy to present day.  He talks of the pain and sorrow from dealing with his parents, which gives insight into what drives him as a runner.  It then covers several races and also talks about being lost a person and as a runner and coming back with his 24 hour American record.<br />I loved the stories and his insight into training and diet.  However, it was more a cliff notes version, instead of the real thing.  Not enough about racing, not enough about being a vegan, and not enough about insights into running.  When you get to the end, you are surprised that you are done; too short.<br />The recipes were great, but not practical for most people that might be considering a veggie diet.<br />Overall, I enjoyed the book and my criticism are also a compliment, since I wanted more insight into his life.
0099579936|3.0|There's no need for my review.  The last reviewer (\\"meymoon\\") absolutely nailed it.  It held my interest enough to finish it but it really does sound like a silly girl wrote it.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game I couldn't get it on my kindle fire for a while for whatever reason and I was upset but now I'm glad they made it available to people with kindle fires :)
B00881VLCE|4.0|I am a puzzle lover but don't have the time or space with kids and animals so this is the next best thing.
B0086700CM|5.0|Could play for days. very challenging at times but that's what makes it fun... get this game ull c what I'm talking about....
B00846REIS|4.0|i enjoyed the book  can not wait for the second book later this years would loike to know more about geidons past
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This Game Is Entertaining.  I Love It Because Its Based On One Of My Childhood Favorite Movies. Cant Get Any Better Then This.
B005HQ5S3G|4.0|I really liked it. Kelly has come a long way since Idol. Her music is so powerful and uplifting! It really makes you feel! I recommend for everyone.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|EXCELLENT READ!!! Will probably read over and over...highly recommend it for anyone and even for husbands. I enjoyed it so much my husband agreed to read it as well. He hasn't been able to put it down either.  I have never been much of a reader but definitley enjoyed this book. You will love it!!
B000008JUM|4.0|It's great to revisit R,H &B after more than 20yrs ago when I had it on cassette. I bought it for a friend in Australia who had never heard it before, despite his interest in Cole Porter and many of the artists who contributed to it. Surprised it wasn't on iTunes, but delighted to find it on Amazon. Fave tracks still Debbie Harry & Iggy Pop - well did u evah? And Kirsty McColl's version of Miss Otis Regrets... but really I like them all and still think these renditions of Porter's classics are definitive for a generation.
B00881VLCE|2.0|I enjoyed doing the puzzles, but this app puts unwanted advertisements on your Xoom tablet.  Therefore, I uninstalled.  I would not recommend this magic puzzle app.
B005B19UPE|5.0|The seamless blend of two stories, settings, and time periods captivated me from the first page. This was truly a great read and a magnificent plot.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Best book ever!!! I absolutely LOVE the love story between Ana and Christian!!!! I have never read a book more that once, but this trilogy I could read over and over!!!!
B004DMIIVO|5.0|I expected a lot from this movie, and it delivered more than I could have imagined. Animation and art direction, beautiful. Characters and story development, amazing. This is instantly one of my favorite animated features. The heart in this movie is incredible. I cant wait for the director, Mamoru Hosoda's next film arriving at the end of July 2012, Wolf Children Ame and Yuki. Check it out here ------>[...]
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I had been hearing all my friends rave about the series of books called 50 shades. I ordered the first one and then couldn't put them down!! I've been married 20 years and I think my husband was glad I read it too, helps you add a little spice.The second book was probably my favorite. But I loved the whole  series and hope she writes more books.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|There is so much to this game. It's a ton of fun and challenging. Definitely makes you think. Probably the first app I've rated 5* in a long long time. Incredibly well made too. Zero issues with freezing. No lagging. Just pure, fun game play.
0345803485|1.0|Badly written, no character development, repetitive and boring. I agree with all the annoying things other reviewers have pointed out - holy ?, the blushing, the inner goddess but I personally found the constant discussion/mention of the hair tie annoying. I thought it was going to feature in some way like Christian tying it around his testicles to get some sort of sexual pleasure! Don't waste your money or time.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Its a really fun game, I like these types of building games. Like the fact you can route the vehicles...that is cool.
B0086700CM|5.0|game is so awesome because you could get coins without buying them unlike glu games(they all sucked execpt frontline commando!!)
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This is a great game! It's challenging, different, and entertaining. It's one of my favorite games to pass those boring and slow afternoons.
B00846REIS|1.0|Loved Fifty Shades. Hated this. Probably because I was re-reading Fifty Shades of Grey.... I picked up this book at a local Target. Originally I grabbed it because the cover art was very similar to that of Fifty Shades. I read the first page and the similarities were unbelievable. I enjoyed Fifty Shades very much. Not a big fan of Bared to You.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|If you are fascinated with Special Forces, you must own this movie; do not just rent it.  Simply put, be prepared to have this show surprise you for what it does for those who respect military personnel, their dedication to country, their jobs, and their Team.  It is exciting, engulfing, and sobering.<br /><br />The filming, camera angles, etc., put you INSIDE the action and there is simply no way actors/stuntmen could have pulled this movie off.  I doubt anybody assumes this is/was a \\"story to be told.\\"  This movie is a vehicle to display SEAL Teams in action and honor the dedication of the soldiers and their families.<br /><br />Bravo to those who wrote and produced this work.  We \\"non-dangerous\\" types very much appreciate the efforts to give us a glimpse into the SEAL world.  More importantly, we honor those who serve and sacrifice so we may walk this earth as free men.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Use this everyday! best app, i love that you can choose to have different ways of turning the alarm off, like shake your device, do a math problem.. etc.. love it. so many customizations. not sure what the paid version could offer that this one doesnt already address? LOVE!
B0086700CM|3.0|I really liked it until I figured out that no matter how good u get; there is no other levels but one. now that suck
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I read some of the reviews claming that thr book was boring and umeventful. so at first i was kinda unsure if i wantd to get it. but after reading it i dont understand what you guys are talking about. George Martin is an exallent story teller and i really enjoyed this book.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I love this game unlike most games there's tons of ways to get invest points other then spending real money.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I picked this up for $2.99 during one of the App Store specials, and I would've gladly paid full price if I'd known how good it was.  With Google Docs connectivity and the ability to access and edit cloud and Kindle-based files, it turns the Fire into more than a media tablet. Highly recommended.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|I found the movie to be a great continuing of the series. I will agree that it is not as good as the first but I am looking forward to seeing what is next.<br /><br />With regards to the digital copy that someone has commented on does not exist, but I say that is not true. I bought this movie and got the digital copy as well. I have downloaded it not to just my computer but my kindle fire and my droid phone. Not sure why people have trouble with this but I think this is a great feature.<br />I am how ever still testing this to make sure it is easy. It looks like you can download it but need the internet connection to verify it to play it.<br />I will be back with more comments on this.
B00785P2QC|4.0|a really good game. you don't have to buy every thing (investor points) like a lot of other games unless you want to buy big items or expand quickly. just log in daily and post daily and you get points and cash that way. you also are rewarded for acheivments.
B0086700CM|5.0|it finally out and it is so addicting  but it sux that it has been this long but im happy that it is out now
B005K17RU0|5.0|No complaints. It performs as advertised on my kindle fire. many great features like humidity and radar. Only annoying thing is that it is forcing me to leave this review to continue using it.
B0086700CM|5.0|Gods, I see what my friends meant now. this game is truly addicting. Got it the night it came out and have hardly put it down since! If you are looking for a quixotic, adventuristic time waster, here it is. (btw, your welcome for being enlightened that quixotic is a word. Now look it up.)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Everyone just acts like this is the only erotica book out there. There are definitely an infinite amount of better written books. (Making an assumption here...) Lot's of vanilla women are so excited because they can get away with reading about a book that is actually about sex, without it being a blatant book about sex... but at this point the general public knows what it is about, so why not skip the terribly written Twilight fan fiction and get yourself a real erotica book? Really, Anastasia Steele is a terrible character. Then again, I don't particularly enjoy books where the female lead is an idiot. It's kind of insulting.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a awesome game pretty easy the only problem I have it slide sometimes when I try to turn other than really fun and simple to learn
0446547654|1.0|Usually an author's \\"acknowledgement\\" page is just something to gloss over, the \\"I wanna thank my wife, my kids, my agent\\" page.  On the acknowledgement page, Nicholas Sparks writes that \\"Some books are more difficult to write than others, and this book (The Best of Me) was more difficult than most.\\"  Then he goes on to thank his wife, his kids, his agent, and on and on.<br /><br />The book was difficult to write because he didn't know what to write, how to write it, and which characters he wanted to be in the heads of.  \\"The Best of Me\\" is a mess like a rusted out, non-running old Chevy parked in Tuck Hostetler's driveway.  To start, what man would pine for a high school puppy love for twenty years?  Okay, Ted in the movie \\"There's Something about Mary,\\" but that was a farce and had no designs to be anything else.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is not much more to say other than comment on the cardboard quality of the characters Mr. Sparks has drafted this time.  I simply could not stomach the book past page 125.  Surprisingly, \\"The Best of Me\\" rates at an overall 3.5 based on the other Amazon reviews, and nearly half of all the reviews are five star.  Nicholas Sparks has written some arresting stories in the past and his dedicated readers know all of his shorthand and nuances.  Plainly stated, he could put excrement on a shingle and toss it out there and they'd all think it was great!<br /><br />This book came to me as part of an introductory package for a book club and I still feel ripped off.  Now that's bad.
B005K17RU0|3.0|this app is now just ok. the old format was more intuitive and not so stylized. just give me the weather, please.
B0077SGMXM|4.0|Here's a very interesting little game. It's a cross between a golf game and a physics puzzle. Simple enough to play casually, challenging enough get a little competitive. Runs smoothly.<br /><br />Here on the Amazon Store, they're claiming that it's &quot;normally&quot; $3.00, but free today. Well, guess what? It's free every day on the Google Play Store. Oh, and it's a newer version with less permissions.<br /><br />I got it today from here just in case someday it actually does become a paid app, but I certainly uninstalled it and grabbed it from the Play Store.<br /><br />Shame on you, Amazon. I find myself coming here less and less for my device apps and games.<br /><br />Great game though. I highly recommend it to anyone.
B0006J28L4|5.0|Interesting depiction of the life of Malcolm X. One thing this movie demonstrates is how a person can be manipulated by another.
B006WAIV6M|5.0|This book was recommended to me by one whose opinion I respect more and more with each passing year. Therefore I was not surprised to find that it was informative, thought-provoking and useful. The methods described in the book, sensibly applied, are life-enhancing and time-saving. If I find one useful pointer in a book I consider my time well spent. I found many useful and applicable pointers in this book, so it was not alone time well spent but I expect that it will also save me time in the future. Buy and enjoy!
0792163710|5.0|The scenery is awesome and not done with a Green Screen but filmed on location in the foothills of the Grand Teton's. This is another film worth watching at least once in \\"Commentary Mode\\". I remember my dad taking me to see this one many years ago when the movie screens were twice their current size and one felt they were a part of the majestic landscape in the movie.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works great. Love it on my KFire because it is BIG and simple to use but has extra easy features like tip/total calculate.  great adding machine features.  really awesome app and its free!

1609613937|5.0|Dr John McDougall redefines humans as \\"Starchivores\\", and presents a comprehensive argument to support his claim. In classic McDougall style, he exposes the vested interests and institutions that perpetuate the myth that animal foods are essential or good for our health. He uses his vast knowlege of human nutrition to dispell the fears that plant based diets are inadequate. I admire his boldness in naming the book The Starch Solution, complete with potato on the front cover, in defiance of our current neo-Atkins era.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is such a good game.  My only minor fault Is that the rock part makes you f&agrave;ll ot so easy.
B002ZG980U|4.0|This is one of the best movies Ive seen in the last decade. The DVD doesnt have too many features but this movies is just phenomenal.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I didn't want to buy the book because of the cover and low price.. but I took the chance anyways and I feel so in debt with the author! I learned, I cried I laughed and cried again and almost the whole book is highlighted with quotes and sayings.. WOW!<br />I was deeply involved with the characters!
B007JMW46U|4.0|This is one of the first books I've read on my new Kindle. I love the portability and how easy it is to read in daylight. My favorite feature is that I have an automatic bookmark (unless I accidentally press the back or forward buttons too long).<br /><br />Sherlock Homes is a classic, and the pictures are impressive. My Kindle has a tendency to show two images, the second overlapping the one beneath slightly. I can see the entire picture with a strip of the top repeated above. Not a big problem, but it does look messy. I can live with it as a free book, but it does bring my overall review down to a 4.
B00005JLR2|5.0|Thank you for this DVD.  My grandson has been asking for it for a long time.  The DVD was received promptly and plays great.

B000065SD7|5.0|Here is a review about the Dumbo 1991 VHS. A Key to spot this is the 1991 VHS and not the 1989 VHS is to look at the ISBN Codes at the back. If one has the ISBN Code on the back in the Bottom-Left corner, your getting the 1989 VHS. If one has the ISBN Code at the Top-Right, you are getting the 1991 VHS.<br /><br />This tape does have it's Pluses, and does have it's Downfalls.<br /><br />Starting with the good stuff, is that what you get, is amazing quality. For the time period being, A Few Disney films were released with the \\"Buena Vista\\" logo at the beginning of the film. Before Buena Vista stamped their logo on lots of Disney films, they were under the RKO Logo. Starting from Which i believe is 1994 or somewhere in the late 90's, Walt Disney Home Video started to release the films with their original RKO Bumper at the beginning, making the Buena Vista versions a bit rare. From 1981-1991, Dumbo was released on VHS, BETA, CED Disc, and Laserdisc all with the Buena Vista logo at the beginning. So the 1991 VHS (IS) one of those Buena Vista Releases. This is the last time the Dumbo Buena Vista fanfare was ever seen on VHS. Considering this is the last release with the fanfare, the quality on this version is FANTASTIC. It has been restored (which i would say is not the best restoration like on the Blu Ray and 60th Anniversary DVD,) but it is still very good restoration for it's time period, considering the early \\"Neon Mickey 1981-1985\\" releases would have some part of the original 16mm or 35mm (cant really tell or know) film spots and grains from back when it was on the big screen. I would highly recommend converting this to DVD, so you might as well have 2 copies of the film.<br /><br />Now going on to the Negatives.<br /><br />This is a bit dumb that this is a complaint, but it's true. This tape opens with:<br /><br />1. 1984 FBI Warnings<br />2. 1989 Walt Disney Classics logo<br />3. Buena Vista logo<br />4. Film<br /><br />I think they could have placed a commercial or some sort of trailer on this release for upcoming releases (or just like on the Peter Pan 1990 VHS, they have one Theatrical Trailer for \\"The Rescuers Down Under\\"). I think they could have squeezed the Beauty & The Beast Trailer (as seen on The Jungle Book 1991 VHS) somewhere, whether it was before or after the movie.<br /><br />Overall, i'd give this release a 9.5/10 . The Restoration on this was fantastic, especially for the time period it was done. The Cover artwork looks amazing as well. The only thing that just didn't make it to 10/10 for me is the lack of previews. And i think Dumbo is a wonderful film i'd suggest anybody to check out. But this Particular VHS Release deserves in it's own respect a 9.5/10 .or some sort of trailer on this release for upcoming releases (or just like on the Peter Pan 1990 VHS, they have one Theatrical Trailer for \\"The Rescuers Down Under\\").

0920668372|5.0|this is such a sweet and simple book expressing love for a child and the  love of a mother although I have to admit I never did sneek into their room to rock them after the age 5 probably, oh what am I saying I just recently after their fathers death went in to hug them many times, but the stories idea is so precious I gave it to my 2 sons and 2 daughters when their father recently passed
0307888908|4.0|I may be jaded because I've been reading / listening business and professional development books and biographies of influential people for over a decade, and all of them basically say the same things:  believe in yourself and persevere.  After my last statement, it may sound like I'm tired of these books or don't find them to be of use, but I do love these books.  What I find inspiring is these individual's abilities to overcome and adapt with an almost instinctive hearing of their true calling.<br /><br />As I said before, I like the new presentation with lots of pertinent examples from Detroit to Intel and everywhere in between, and it's definitely an uplifting text with lots of good practical information.  If you're willing to put the time and effort into professional networking, why not learn from THE founder (co-founder anyway)of Linked In.<br /><br />Overall, a good addition to any professional's library.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Don't let the in app purchases change your mind this is a great game. You pay money If you want to buy addtnl powerballs while playing the courses, Which if youre careful about your ball selection you won't ever need. Ive beaten the game ages ago, But I wanted to make sure to come on here and give it five stars because it deserves it. I've spent hours killing time on this game. It has a low learning curve and your slows you into the difficulty or gives you the chance to go straight for the hard courses. I strongly suggest you try to get the nitro ball as soon as you can it's definitely the most useful.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|fun story. a little slow sometimes.  not very challenging but kills time. wish you could enlarge the pictures.  would buy another one. worth the money.
B00001QEE7|5.0|The Little Mermaid is one hour and twenty-five minutes and was released in theaters on November 14, 1989. This was the 28th animated film to be released by Disney Studios and the first of ten movies of the Disney Renaissance era (1989 to 1999).

She gives Ariel three day for the Prince to fall in love with her and it must be love true kiss and she has to do this without her voice. Prince Eric and Ariel come close but are foiled by Flotsam and Jetsam. Ursula sees this and turns herself human and uses Ariel singing voice to trick Prince Eric. Prince Eric and Ursula are about to tie the knot when the cavalry comes to the rescue. The shell that is holds Ariel voice in broken and she gets her voice back but it is too late. Ariel changes back into a mermaid and Ursula takes her back to sea. Prince Eric not wanted to loose her again goes after and a good old Disney fight\rescue breaks out and you know the rest of the story.<br /><br />Some trivia about this movie; this was the first fairy tale movie since Sleeping Beauty and the last movie to use hand-painted cels and analog camera. This was the first Disney movie to receive an Academy Award since Bedknobs and Broomsticks. The two Academy Awards the movie won were for Best Music, Original Score and Best Music, Original Song (Under The Sea). Kiss the Girl was also nominated for Original Song. The Little Mermaid also won two Grammy and Golden Globe awards. The Little Mermaid is a wonderful movie andgets an AAAAA+++++.<br /><br />DVD FEATURES<br /><br />Chapter Selection<br />Set Up<br />A.

0451169514|5.0|With more than 1,000 pages, \\"It\\" by Stephen King is not for everyone. Some of King's references--from both the late 1950s and the mid 1980s--will go over the heads of some readers. King also, especially towards the end, plays around too much with his narrative, bouncing back and forth between both time periods. All these matters aside, \\"It\\" ranks as one of King's best books. He is, as always, a fine craftsman of sentences and paragraphs. His characters are lovingly developed. King shows the terrors of childhood and contrasts them with adulthood, all the while creating a detailed and exciting plot with excellent characters. King creates a town and a host of characters and then sends a monster--never quite fully explained thankfully--to haunt it. More than 25 years after it was first published, \\"It\\" remains one of the leading books by one of the most popular writers of his era. While not for everyone, readers who immerse themselves in \\"It\\" will be rewarded with one of the most exciting and thought provoking books that King has ever offered.
B003HYNB34|3.0|I was sad to see David Tennant leave the show as well as the departure of Russell T. Davis as the show runner.  I really enjoyed the over arching story plots that Davis wrote and David Tennant will always be my \\"Doctor\\".  I was hoping for the best with Steven Moffat as I liked some of the stories he wrote during Tennant's time (Girl in the Fire Place had to be one of my favorites still).  With Matt Smith I tried to go into this season (series) open minded as I knew how much a personality change can occur between Doctors.<br /><br />With all the said it took me a lot longer to get into this new direction the show was going in.  I like the new companion Amy Pond as well as her boyfriend Rory.  She had an interesting introduction and came to like her.  Don't know where I would rank her with the other modern companions but she is not to a bad pick.<br />I felt Matt Smith was trying to be like David Tennant too much and then I felt like he was trying to go too much in the opposite direction.  I just didn't feel like he settle for the part.  River Song comes back but I'm not a huge fan of her.  I found her very annoying compared to the River that was in the previous season.<br />Part of the reason why I think I didn't like Matt Smith so much was because of the stories.  Overall the crack in space and time story was interesting but individual stories didn't capture me as past episodes did under Davis' control.  The finale was especially disappointing.  I like the second to last episode much more then the last.  Stuff that Davis would never have used in the story because it scrambles and makes stuff messy to keep track of was used constantly through out the finale and even now I still don't understand what fully happened.<br /><br />I stuck with it though out of love for the show and now writing this half way into season 6 I can say it gets a lot better.  Matt Smith gets in his groove and Moffat has great plans with the show. Oh and River Song gets less annoying the next season.  So stick with the show, Matt Smith finds himself eventually and Season 6 is only a few episodes away.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|THESE ARE THE MOST AWESOME BOOKS.  YOU CAN'T PUT THEM DOWN. A PERSON IS READY FOR ANOTHER. IS THERE AN ANOTHER?
B0063IH60K|4.0|This app is fun and free! Best of all., although there are ads and commercials., but you are not forced to watch them!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have heard so much about these books that I had to finally read them for myself.  And AFTER I started, I couldn't put them down! They were great!
B007FH9GT2|4.0|A suspenseful taut drama with good acting by all the principals. Certainly well worth the 99 cents I paid to rent it.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This is a very good bestseller I would rate it 999,999,999,999 stars!!!! i luv it :):):) I read up until 12:00 am practically I can't wait to read The Mark of Athena
B006G2NVCA|5.0|A great cd. If you are a fan of Trent Reznor it is a must have. Very hypnotic. It is a well crafted as the book from which the movie was inspired.
B0056C6XIA|1.0|As my title reads, this product is not intended for extensive use and I would not trust it in a survival situation.  Chinese quality manufacturing and a gimick namesake does not make for any sort of confidence in this product.  Considering that you can buy a Leatherman 831426 Wingman Multi-Tool for $25, a Gerber 22-80012 Infinity Ultra Task LED Flashlight $15, and a SE 2\\" X 3/16\\" Flint/Fire Starter w/ Lanyard for $3 your only paying $60+ for the Grylls name.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game gets you addicted as soon as you start playing. the random tragedies and sicknesses keeps the game interesting from the building to the cropping to the collecting of food and lumber to make your buildings.(: must get!
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Anyone who is a Castle fan would love this book. The chemistry between Rook and Heat leads you to believe that their partnership is something more than solid. I loved this book I recommend this and all Richard Castle books.
1609611543|5.0|heard about this on talk radio..it works!! i have lost 13 pounds just  giving up all wheat products and following guidelines concerning sugar intake..a little difficult finding wheat free products but it is worth the effort..purchsed book at Amazon..
B000VSAEYI|3.0|I got this for my 2 year old son and he really loved it - played with it constantly for a week and a half until it got a hole in it (probably not the manufacturer's fault - could have been caused by our dogs wanting to play in it too!). The reason I am giving it only 3 stars is because the slide was really lame (could barely hold up my son who only weighs about 30 pounds) and to be honest, draining  this thing every day was a pain. Not a bad buy for the price but only expect to have it for one season. Next time I will go for a plastic pool which is what I should have done in the first place.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Simply the best fantasy epic I have read thus far....Do yourself a favor and read it .. You won't be disappointed !!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I saw a review of this book in a magazine and thought I'd give it a try.  It is a great psycho-thriller and takes twists and turns that the reader certainly does not suspect.  Critics may say, correctly, that the story is far-fetched and that the main characters are not very likeable, but I thoroughly enjoyed the ride into their twisted story!  A real page-turner!
B0086700CM|4.0|I loved playing this game and even though I unlocked everything it was still entertaining. But now whenever I open it, it wont open. It was fun until it stopped working. &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;
B007P6VM04|3.0|\\"SMASH,\\" without a doubt was one of the better series on TV this past season. The acting, directing, writing, and music was of Broadway quality. The disk, however, lacks a bit compared to other Broadway disks. This is definitely a disk that needed to be a DVD not a CD, since the music was enhanced by the choreography. Missing from the disk are some of the better songs from the latter part of the season. The effort to capitalize on the show was, thus, reduced by not having a couple of the more powerful songs. (Also: liner notes could have been better written.)
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Works great to capture prayers from sources to remember and use again.  Backs up the apps that use it for that well also.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Excellent ap...very addictive.  This app works with my Droid Razor with no problems.  The other Mahjongs that I've downloaded always locked up after a few hours of play.  This one I played five hours with no problems. It's a keeper.
0525478817|2.0|I just read the first 39 pages of this book, and I probably should not be reviewing it. The opening was catchy, but relationship and conversations between Hazel and Gus are unbelievable. I am a teacher, and most teens are not this witty. I am going to give it a chance and finish the book, but I am somewhat sickened that the two main characters have such similar personalities. Perhaps I don't know enough about this JOHN GREEN NERD STUFF, but these kids sound like authors who put deep hours of thought into everything they say, but it just flies out of their mouths.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game because unlike its competition the time waiting periods are much shorter. Whereas many of these games make you wait hours on end to achieve goals and build Ice Age Village doesn't. So YEY!! &amp; ENJOY.
B00846TTDG|5.0|A really exciting movie. When a movie is this good, at what it was meant to be, an action movie, then very few words are required. Action scenes were very realistic and the Seal's use of technology was enlightening and, well, just cool. Do not pay attention to the snobs. This movie will not win any Academy Awards, but it will keep you glued to your seat and it will not disappoint. Set your expectations. It is what it is. A cool action flick.
