B006ID6NDQ|4.0|Different take on a Holocaust Survivors story.  I have read many accounts of holocaust survival and always thought I would had gone into hiding had I been in that position.  Though the story shows that it was still just as terifying to be in hiding during this time in history.
B008YKGQR4|3.0|This app has good intentions. Just meds a lot of work. Had trouble logging in and freezing up not the app I was looking for.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like to play to wind down. I've never had an issue with this app at all. some of the ads at the beginning are annoying but a small price to pay when it's free. :-) I recommend this app if you enjoy solitaire.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I'm feeling incredibly grateful today, that this album (which I feel like I've been waiting SO long for) is actually everything I hoped it would be and more. I love every song; there is so much beauty and depth and feeling, so many incredible melodies and stirring lyrics, so much pure musical profundity.  And while I would describe this album as sweeter and gentler in many ways than their last album, 'Sigh No More,' it somehow still retains all of that Mumford and Sons grit, grunt, and intensity.  You absolutely need this album, and like me you are probably going to be listening to it every single day for months.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|Me and my Wife picked this film up off the shelf on our first anniversary holiday as potentially a good film to sit and watch together in the evening. We didn't know anything about the film or it's rich literary history at the time.<br /><br />We both loved it. The world that Andrew Stanton (understandably so when you can produce a film with a world as immerisive as WALL-E) built was beautiful and intriguing, especially when you see the remains of destroyed civilisations and what Barsoom (Mars) would have been.<br /><br />We thought the casting was great, with Lynn Collins playing an excellent Dejah Thoris, with some excellent scenes where you really become drawn in to her character and predicament. The same with John Carter himself, especially the links between his tortured past and his growing feelings towards Dejah which are interspersed throughout the film.<br /><br />The action scenes were great, fast paced, exciting, but not to extended that they lost their place in the storyline, all the while showing great visual effects work.<br /><br />The other main characters in the story such as the Thirks and Woola the 'dog' were very enjoyable and complemented well the main characters.<br /><br />The ending was a killer, cementing dislike for Matai Shang, and invoking deep resonation with the Dejah and John Carter's sudden seperation. This ending just screams for a sequel, we hope that, despite the mixed critic reviews (I have no idea why) and box-office turnout, the two planned sequels will be released to bring Edgar Rice Burrough's classic work in the 21st century, since they have been a major foundation for much modern sci-fi and superhero concepts, it is in fact they that were behind the times, not John Carter.<br /><br />We also thought that the score was absolutely wonderful, John Carter's theme being especially moving.<br /><br />All in all a great film, thoroughly recommended.
0425263908|1.0|Total waste of time, even tho a quick read.  Just kept thinking why?? Didn't care for the characters or their sicko relationship.  Total trainwreck.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|I just downloaded this....AMAZING...i just sit here with my mouth open ... this really. works!!  Get it it is worth. it. I cant wait to play it with my Grandson's .. We. will. all sit here in amazement! Again. great. app....GET IT!!!!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Thank you Lee Child for another great read.  I love the opening and love the closing, wonderful writing.  And Reacher, as always, is THE MAN.  The ins and outs of his problems in this episode keep you flipping through pages till suddenly it's over.  I stare at my Kindle and hope you're nearly done with his next adventure.  I've read and loved every one.  More please!
B003ODIZL6|3.0|This book was better than i thought it would be. It was helpful and useful.  Enough with positives this book boring and i did not want to keep looking at it! It was really not any good and i recommend that you do NOT read this book.
B009329ZF2|2.0|Many times I wonder why Hollywood keeps on making extremely bad movies at a major rate. I guess is just the assembly line mentality...
B004CURZFC|3.0|The animation and 3D effects were outstanding.  The detail on the animation was stunning--you could see the fuzz on the feathers of the owls.  The story was a repetition of many that have gone before.  This time it featured owls.
0553582038|4.0|A Feast for Crows suffers from having to follow the best book in the series, A Storm of Swords, while also including characters that are either new (the Dornish), or are new to having their own point of view chapters (the Greyjoys).  However, you really have to read all five books of the series fairly quickly in succession or even those with good memories will forget a lot of the minor characters and how they relate to both each other and to the major characters.<br /><br />That said, it's still a very strong book that works well with A Dance with Dragons, much of which runs concurrently with Feast.  I enjoyed the events on the Iron Islands and in Dorne and watching what happened in King's Landing with Jamie & Cersei.  It was also nice to see Sam grow as a character.<br /><br />On the negative side, the plot is definitely not as fast-paced as the previous books, where I would finish each chapter and say I can't wait to see what happens to that character next.<br /><br />Overall, a very good book.  I just hope we don't have to wait as long for book six as we did for books four and five.
B001POXA02|4.0|I like this watch but as I have begun using it more at night a problem has arisen. The luminosity is good but the fact that the hour and minute hands are only luminescent as dots causes a problem where sometimes the the minute hand blends into the markers and gets lost especially at a glance. It also is ocassionally hard to tell the minute hand quickly from the hour hand. This all could have been fixed easily if Seiko had coated the entire hands with the luminous material. I viewed the pictures of the night time illumination on line and the pictures looked much clearer than it does in real life. It appears well built. It is an attractive watch and the kinetic feature keeps it charged wearing it only part of the day.

B00190N4E4|4.0|The movie Gandhi begins when Mahatma Gandhi, an Indian lawyer, is travelling to South Africa.  The government has made new registration requirements for non-Christian citizens that, consequently, label them as second class citizens.  After freeing the South Africans from religious oppression, Gandhi travels back to his home country of India.  During this time, India is seeking liberation from British rule.  Gandhi travels all over India and experiences the hardships that Britain is causing his native people.  Although an upper class citizen, Gandhi refuses to relish in many of the luxuries.  He travelled in third class and would wear only a home-spun type of loin cloth.  He began preaching about non-violent non-cooperation as a strategy for freeing the country of India from Britain's control.  After the British military kill over fifteen hundred Indian citizens in a massacre many riots break out as people seek revenge against British soldiers.  Gandhi pledges to fast until the violence has ceased.  As the film continues there are several other displays of civil disobedience and many incidences of Gandhi being arrested.  India does finally gain it's freedom from Britain, but not without the cost of turning over the territories that are primarily Muslim to Pakistan.  This causes hostility along the India-Pakistan border.  In the end the man who fought against violence is shot and killed by a Hindu man who thought Gandhi was too concerned about India's Muslim population.<br /><br />This movie related to world religions in many ways.  First, it displays the oppression that many religions have faced when they are the minority in their resident nation.  It also demonstrates the conflicts that have been going on over religion for many years.  The caste system is also exhibited when Gandhi is travelling around India and associates with members of lower castes than his own, refuses to live as an upper class citizen, and will only travel third class.  I also believe Gandhi isone of the many reasons that Hindus are so accepting of other religions, because he was accepting of everyone.  Overall, the movie Gandhi was educational and informative.  It left me feeling as though Mahatma Gandhi's stand against violence left a huge footprint on the world.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Just like the other 50's only this one had a beginning middle and end. With the ending being the one everyone knew was coming after they finished the first book. :) Overall decent series. No complaints.<br /><br />*If you are big into literature you aren't going to think this is a good read. I wouldn't say this was a phenomenally written book, but it is a good read.
B001KVZ6HK|1.0|Don't get me wrong, it's one of my favorite movies and I highly recommend it as a Blu-ray purchase for any action and/or hero fan. The problem is that this 4 disc set is nothing but a sham, and on multiple levels:<br /><br />Digital Copy:<br />First, the only supported tablet is the Ipad, so for all of us Android tablet users, don't dream about taking the movie with you on the go through legitimate means.<br />In fact, even if you choose the WMP version which can only be seen on your computer, you might face difficulties. My Laptop apparently needed a security update (which I couldn't get no matter how much I tried), in spite of the fact that it's running on the latest version.<br /><br />Digital Music Download:<br />Why not simply include the music within the set in MP3 files? Here's why. Although you've already paid a higher price for a set that should provide the soundtrack, they feel that you still haven't actually paid enough. After giving my authentication code online, I was asked for personal contact info. WTH!?!? I have enough spam mail as it is! I decided to give it a shot and give my email address, at risk of getting flooded by unwanted ads.<br />What message did I get upon punching in my zip code? \\"Not available in some regions\\". Never mind that I purchased it at a local retail store.<br /><br />This set (I assume) should only be sought out by those who actually have a full 3d home theater set. Even then, I fell as though everything listed after DVD in features is false advertising.<br /><br />I bought the set yesterday, and today I'm going back to my local retail store to get my money back and get the simple, Blu-ray set.<br /><br />Update:<br />Retailer won't accept opened movie.<br /><br />Someone commented that I shouldn't whine over a product that costs $19.99 or technology that doesn't work.<br /><br />It wasn't $19.99, it was $29.99. And it works just fine if you torrent a ripped file.<br /><br />I'll whine as much as I want over a product whose label reads \\"watch anywhere, anytime\\", with pictures of phones and tablets, and doesn't deliver. If I'd known the truth of what was inside, I would have saved 10 dollars by buying the simple set, a lot of time trying to get something to work when it doesn't, and the stress of going back to the store (in vain). I posted this for the benefit of those who might want what I wanted out of the product.<br /><br />There's a second reason why this whole situation is upsetting to me:<br />The industry is trying to fight piracy, which I understand and respect. If they would make it easier for people like me to get what we want (instead of difficult or even impossible through legitimate means), I would gladly pay full price for a movie if I can use it for my personal enjoyment in technology that is by no means new. Another user who got to use it on his laptop said that he still needs to use the DVD to authenticate his ownership every time he wants to watch the digital file on his computer, so in essence it's just like popping in the DVD.<br /><br />This is the 3rd consecutive movie that I buy (and love) with a \\"digital copy\\" that is inaccessible.<br />I don't care if it's $2.00 or $200, don't sell me something that doesn't do what you say it does.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I very much enjoyed this book. I am becoming an avid reader and this was one of my favorites lately. I wasn't a big fan of the back and forth writing style, but after I got used to it and got into the book I started to really enjoy it. I think the twists make the book very enjoyable for everyone to read and I like how she has a way of making everyone react the same way throughout the book. I am looking forward to reading more of her books. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes suspense, mystery, with a little bit of romance hidden throughout.
1609611543|1.0|When you buy a diet book, you like to get started right off.  There was just too much information and stories about wheat.  The average person will get tired of reading all these facts.  I felt like I was preparing for an exam on wheat.  I did find the eggplant receipe very good. A shopping list of the new foods I would need would of been nice.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Word of advice: don't take a break from this series or else you might not finish. I read all 3 in less than a week. However my friends that read the first one started the second and then took a week off, they got bored and didn't want to finish them. I think they are a great read and that they got a lot of women reading who may have otherwise not been readers.<br /><br />I would recommend reading all 3, stay away from critiquing the writing and just sit back relax and enjoy the books. :)
0307383415|5.0|Dreams from M[[ASIN:1400082773 Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance]]y Father by Barack Obama<br /><br />Great men become greater.<br /><br />Dreams From My Father is an autobiography written with a beauty of language that could easily be mistaken for fiction of a literary stature. Throughout the three sections -- his origins in Hawaii, his life in Chicago and his visit to Kenya -- Barack Obama's reflections shape the book with much intelligence. Dreams from his father... not quite his own dreams and not his father's dreams either.<br /><br />It is a book about divisions and parts and exposures to cultures: Hawaiian, American (black and white), African and Asian. And being closely knit with each. It is an understandable whole, a rich personal history.<br /><br />Barack Obama is born to a white American mother from Kansas and a black Kenyan father. His parents part company soon after the birth of the child. His father returns to Kenya and Barack hardly has him in his life after that. He is brought up by his mother and grandparents in Hawaii. When his mother remarries, mother and son go to live in Indonesia where he is brought up by his Indonesian stepfather. Living and attending school in Indonesia exposes him to a totally different culture and experiences. His mother sends him to America to complete high school.<br /><br />Soon after, he travels to Kenya, where he gets to know his father and meets his `brothers and sisters' and a horde of aunties and uncles and other relatives. On his return to America, he continues his studies and, after graduating, he goes to Chicago to work in underprivileged black communities before deciding to go to law school at Harvard.<br /><br />Hawaii, Indonesia, America, and Kenya give texture to his life. His exploration of his identity and understanding, his taste of a varied life of weaknesses and strengths, is written with honesty, sensitivity and openness.<br /><br />Barack Obama is a great writer and it is not surprising that his oratory reflects a man of conviction, and a man who is comfortable with himself.<br /><br />We are indeed fortunate to have such a man live amongst us and for us to be in an era where we get to read him, see him, hear him, and experience the changes he hopes to bring about.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|A book that charges your life, every young person should read this and understand that  life can be a lot harder than they think it is today, it challenges your mind to be positive and clearer in thoughts
0670022950|5.0|If you're interested in thinking about the foundations of modern civilization and/or current events, you need to engage with this book (whether you agree with it or not).  I cannot recommend it highly enough.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Fortunately, I did not spend any money on this book, or I would have felt robbed.  My expectations were low, but it managed to squeeze under the bar anyway.<br /><br />Are these characters actually compelling to anyone???  Ana, the most inarticulate literature major ever, is whiny, petulant and suffers from that most trite of all female delusions, that she can somehow \\"fix\\" her man.  And Christian, supposedly the most successful, self-assured man in the free world, acts like an insecure teenager through the whole book.  Every single demand he has, he almost immediately rescinds.  Does he have no spine at all?<br /><br />And the writing, oh, the writing!!!  I would call it juvenile, but that would be insulting to junior high school writers everywhere.  As many have already noted, words, actions and phrases are repeated ad nauseum.  Perhaps the author is trying for some kind of Gertrude Stein absurdist tone, but no, I think she's just a terrible writer.  The one that got me was that she tells us over and over and over again that Christian is handsome, but other than grey eyes and tousled copper hair, we are given absolutely no details of his appearance.  And of course, the hair is always tousled.  Come on, *show* me that he's handsome, don't just say \\"he's so handsome\\" over and over!<br /><br />As for the sex scenes, it reads like the amateur erotica hour.  As with the rest of the book, they are repetitive, and a bit dull.<br /><br />I am all for a bit of escapist fluff, but this was so poorly written that it wasn't even remotely enjoyable.  There is so much better erotica out there, it is sad that this dross is what has become the most successful novels of the genre.
6305127638|5.0|I order Star Trek First Contact and the quiality of the movie was excellent no damage at all. Will continue to enjoy this movie.
B004SRWW0C|5.0|it does the job but be careful i turned my phone into a brick...luckly i know how to unbrick the phone...so use it but be careful.
B008XBCJ34|3.0|First, I have to say that this was an excellent technological work. Great special effects that almost-always (couple of quirks noticed) that made you feel like these characters were actually real. The fantasy world was awesome.<br /><br />Why did James Cameron have to ruin such cinematography with his trashed political message? Seriously...Cameron interjects cliche, bad attitudes, and criminalizes organizations in this movie that in reality, would not and should never happen. The back story that I keep seeing when I watch the movie is \\"run away from reality, and make the bad people go away\\"...which isn't realistic, nor is it even portrayed as such in a Disney film.<br /><br />A small adjustment on the story, and what is a 3-star film could have been a memorable 5-star movie, that could have spanned decades. Sadly, I've watched the classic 'Fright Night' more than I will ever watch this failure...at least it isn't trying to 'hard-sell me a philosophy'.  If my children were still young, I am not sure I would let them watch this...at least without explaining Cameron's skewed perspective in the script.
B004UID2LC|1.0|it was perfect until recently it wont let me view or download anything even though ive downloaded a song earlier! please fix!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|No Easy Day was well written. It contained no security or identity issues as far as I could tell. These are special people who do  very good job.
B0073XV2W2|4.0|having read some of the reviews prior to my purchase of the ebook,  i was prepared for some disappointing reading - at least in spots.  but i was attracted to the feasibilty of what was portrayed within.  it isn't just the proliferation of drones that scares me,  but the manipulation of the internet with phony incidents -  being equally scary.  both seem to be easily within our reach.  all in all a good read.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I bought Season 1 and 2. I have placed an order for season 3. I love this production. I purchased the DVD's not knowing what the story line was. If you are interested in British society and the way they live purchase the movies. The story begins before world war one. You will have many hours of pure entertainment.
B0053O89XI|3.0|I recently pick up Season 5 at Best buy. I just finish watch the whole season 5, and I was kinda disappointed.<br /><br />I feel it isn't about bunch of nerds living next door to a hot chick anymore.<br /><br />I feel the writers are moving away from the NERD concept and giving each one a relationship or trying to, stripping away the NERD title.<br /><br />If they continue on this course it might be another boring sitcom.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|This toy required a bit of assembly, but it was and easy snap together operation.  I requires 4 AA bateries.  The clips are spring feed and the handle on the front moves the clips into place as the last one is emptied.  I could not beleive how far this thing shot a dart.  I stood back in my yard and fired thinking the dart would not make it to the street.  I ended up hunting dow the dart in my neighbors yard an extra 15 feet past the street.
B008XG1X18|5.0|works great with the kindle fire.  you can view and pin to your page.  also you can share from other pages to pintrest from your kindle fire.  overall I highly recommend this app.
B0015DROBO|4.0|So far I like this book very much.  I'm busy with some house projects right now so do not have a lot of time to be reading, but I like what I've read up to this point.  After watching the movie, I had to buy the book.
1402270275|5.0|This is one of those books I seen on netgalley but I just wasn't too sure about it. I didn't request it because I thought it wasn't going to be for me. Then I kept seeing blogger friends of mine that loved it and Christen at Goldilox and the Three Weres recommended it so I was like okay lets see what this is all about. AND HOLY MACORONI! I freaking loved loved loved it!!! It is going down on my list of favorite books of the year!  As soon as I opened the book I was hooked. I stayed up until 3am reading this and it was so worth the 4 hrs I got of sleep because of it.<br /><br />Kiss of Steel was exactly what I needed. It feels like its been a while since a book has wowed me. I mean there are books by authors or in series I have already read that wowed me but no newbies in a few months and this was just that. I loved the world the characters and every single thing about it. It was unique and beautifully written. Its historical, paranormal, romantic, steampunk and amazing!!<br /><br />I don't even feel like telling you about this book. Because you can honestly read the blurb or the many reviews out there about it. I just want to gush and bask in the awesomeness of my newly found read. If you could see me you would totally see that I am in post reading bliss right now.<br /><br />I am off to go author stalking and see when I can expect more books from this series. Trust me if you want an awesome read pick of Kiss of Steel.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie has been probably the best super-hero movie that I've seen. It's a win-win deal ... you get the second screen option. There's a bluray, 3D, Digital copy and music download. Well. Simply put. It's a great movie and a great deal.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Love the new Reacher book. Couldn't put it down . Bring on the next one! Reacher always pulls out a win when you think there's no hope. But hey, give him a little romance!!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Love the Reacher series. This one was one of the best. Lots of action  and mystery. Please write more about Reacher and his adventures
B0087HT36U|4.0|Great game if you've got some time to kill. Needs more levels, but is fun and challenging on current levels. I dig it!
B000YABS8E|5.0|I've been watching this movie for years, and it never gets old. I often think about what it would be like if this movie was made today about today's society.. it would be even more of a shocker for someone sent down underground in the 50s or 60s! We love this movie, thank you Amazon for carrying it!! Made for a great night.
1455502758|5.0|I'm not going to even pretend that I'm not biased reviewer.  I admired Christopher Hitchens and it was special experience to get to hear him and his prose just one last time.  I can speak for others who don't feel as I do. But this is picturesque Hitchens.  Whether you were ever a fan of Christopher's or loathed him like many do and have for years, I recommend his last foray into the lands of literature no matter your political beliefs, religious beliefs, or even your personal opinion of the man himself.  We can all learn something from death and our insignificant blip on this planet call we Earth.... So why not learn from one of the most brilliant men of the modern era?  Just take it for whatever it's worth to yourself.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|Great application for taking your Office files with you on your Kindle. You really need to full version if you plan on editing your files on your portable device. Not just for reading. Also, this key allows you to preserve security features like password protection for your files. Works like a charm!
B008NW67E0|5.0|Worth the long wait. I was worried they would try to \\"change their sound\\" or be more \\"experimental\\" like so many other bands. Delighted to find they delivered more of exactly what they do best: meaningful, powerful music that comes straight from the soul. Close your eyes and just listen.... It is a rare kind of beauty.
0962477060|5.0|Ok, this is NOT a method or other 'learn to play in 10 minutes' type of product. What it does, though, is present to you a fresh perspective on the guitar and it's unique tuning. Great for anyone learning the guitar all the way down from a near beginner to expert players. It does provide some theory but not a lot. Definitely 5 stars on this one!
B007GCY8FS|2.0|Reacher should tell Lee Child that he is ready to retire with Wallander in Malmo.  At some point these characters are like the rest of us and get a little tired.  Poor olde Reacher seems to just enjoyed taking a long ride in the car with no idea where the plot is going to take him. When a tortured plot rears its ugly head it seems to take every neuron that Lee Child can put together to make it sound like our midland is in danger.  To this end the \\"federales\\" (a little south of the border lingo) have set up a rest home for endangered citizens in a corn field away from the protection of the Constitution. It will be interesting to see if lanky Tom Cruse can rescue Reacher from this tanker.
B007BT0RKG|4.0|Works great on the Kindle Fire. This application is a bit bloated but works quite well. Only problem is that you will need to download individual state maps for the various states you need. Not too bad if you will be traveling mostly regionally. maps download fairly quickly. By the way, the maps do go all the way to street level so you can zoom in as much as you want. Route numbers only come up when zoomed way in, though. I like the fact the exit numbers for major highways are also included!
B0063IH60K|4.0|well this app is very nice but it would be better if there were more card games on the app then again.  it 's only a solitaire app so I shoundn't expect much from it but the game itself is fun and nice
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a great app! It is so much user friendly and convenient. I now have it on my Kindle and my Aneroid.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|this book as an easy read flowed nicely and keep you at the edge of your seat the was she discribed situations you could actully see your self there in the time. the way it goes the the story there is something everyone can relate to a feeling a person a situation there is something that draws you in
0545265355|5.0|Excellent quality. Purchased for my pre-teen daughter and wife after they read the first book (paper-back). This Trilogy set is an excellent gift.
B0062NAVXA|4.0|Better than \\"Facing the Giants\\" and \\"Fire Proof,\\" this movie is the best of the three.  There are some truly great moments in this movie, although it can be a little preachy at moments.  In world that pretends that fatherhood is unimportant, this movie celebrates it and encourages men to fulfill their God designed role.  I recommend it!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I love this book, an excellent addition to The Zombie Survival Guide by Max Brooks as well. The author does an excellent job portraying the \\"true\\" story of the ten year zombie war. Written in the form of interviews from various people across the globe and detailing much incite into how the survivors managed to face their biggest enemy of all, the living dead.
B001NKI60W|4.0|It's a cute little movie, not trying to be anything it isn't. You will love it if you are an ABBA fan.  It brought back memories of the day when ABBA was on the radio.
B0035G9ABG|5.0|This album is in line with their other albums yet sounds fresh and innovative. The commercially released tracks have a familiar sound but it also contains gems such as White Flag and Superfast Jellyfish with totally different sounds. The last song titled Pirate Jet seems like a intro to the next album The Fall.
B005HSG3TC|2.0|I have had this case since November 2011.  Like others have reported, I had problems with the stand feature.  Annoying, but it was not a deal breaker.<br /><br />More disturbing is the case started to crack at 2 of the corners and now the corners are about to fall off, making the case unusable.  I have only taken my KFire out of the case once, 10 months ago, to try another case.  I have treated it gently, it has never been dropped, so I really do not understand why the case would crack.
B008N1LL42|5.0|This movie is great. I bought it a few weeks ago and have watched it several times now. I like the way it isn't your typical transformer movie. It has some resemblance but only a small amount. The action is lots, lots, and more.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I so love the books by E L James.  I can hardly put the book down and wish there were more to read after the third book I don't what I will do then.  We need to continue the story or I hope she can release a new series soon.
B0051BVQFG|5.0|The movie has a very good story line. It also has a good bit of emotion on a personal basis. On top of that it has a ton of really good blow-em up action.

B0009HLD0K|5.0|Breaking Away is as meaningful today as it was 30 years ago. Call it the timeless family story. We all have to break away at some point in our lives. Every life story has a beginning, a middle and an end. In this film we see the ending of adolescent innocence and an openness to a new maturity.<br />Robert Obach
B006LSZECO|3.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time, save for the ending.  I really enjoyed the contrast between the husband's chapters and the wife's.  Her writing style kept me interested and the storyline was great.  I am really surprised to see there are people who have given the book 1 or 2 stars.  I am an avid reader and don't often write a review, but after reading this I decided to check out another of her books.  I really do love her style, but she's got to learn how to write a better ending.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I was caught up in the Barber family issues from beginning to end.  I never saw the outcome coming at all.  It was very real and believable.  Told from the viewpoint of the father, I had no problem relating to the emotions (or lack thereof) of any of the characters. Recommend this book to anyone wanting a different kind of courtroom drama.

B007FEFLTO|1.0|Big Ken Follet fan. Could not wait for this book to be released. Just finished a dangerous fortune and could not put it down.  Whomever shadow wrote this book is not the same guy who wrote A Dangerous Fortune.<br /><br />I tried to keep going with this book but it seemed to have so much excessive boring descriptions that I eventually gave up. Looks like Ken just set a high level story and some ghost writers were told to fill in the details and make it over a thousand pages.<br /><br />I really don't recommend this book

0812992784|5.0|I had never read any of Salman Rushdie's books, although I had certainly heard of them (How could one not?). However, I recently did listen to a reading of \\"Joseph Anton\\" on BBC Radio 4 in five fifteen-minute snippets that prompted me to contact Amazon.com so that I could read the entire book, which focuses on the writing of Mr Rushdie's novel, \\"The Satanic Verses\\", and the shattering aftermath of its publication.<br /><br />I am especially fascinated in reading an author's account of the creative process of writing and the production of a book. And the prose of Salman Rushdie, whose account of his real life blends so seamlessly with that of his fictional tales, is mesmerising. Written in the third person, \\"Joseph Anton\\" reads like a novel. Occasionally I had to jog my memory as to the identity of the narrator, and to remind myself that I was reading an autobiography. I also found it curious that even though the book is entitled \\"Joseph Anton\\"--Mr Rushdie's chosen cryptonym for a decade--he rarely writes the name, but refers to himself continually with the pronoun 'He'. Gradually, however, I realised that namelessness reflects the author's invisibility during the terrible years of his 'hiding in plain sight'. Joseph Anton is a name that 'He' cannot bear to utter.<br /><br />Salman Rushdie's engrossing memoir is larded with keen wit, as his dry observations on the fickleness of politicians under the stress of shifting public opinion and his  remarks about his thankless stint as a reviewer of other authors' books illustrate. One of the most arresting aspects of the book, however, is Mr Rushdie's commentary on the written word and how it can become so easily distorted, and how this distortion can escalate and result in acrimonious censorship.<br /><br />It takes no leap of credibility to imagine that every professional writer would like his book to top the bestseller list. The subtext of \\"Joseph Anton,\\" however, contains a warning with mythological overtones--\\"Be careful what you wish for\\"--because the author's realisation of 'Best-Sellerdom' has been granted at a terrible price. Imagine waking up one morning and discovering that one's just-published novel, has, like the genie escaping from the bottle, been transmogrified into a worldwide event with the most frightening consequences. And all this occurred before advent of the computer technology to which we have become accustomed. Considering that \\"Joseph Anton\\" concerns events of the late 1980s, the book is especially apt in the context of today's globalised society, with its mercurial advancements of technology in respect not only to the written word but also to the visual image, as recent global events have demonstrated.<br /><br />\\"Joseph Anton\\" is a riveting read, all six-hundred-and-thirty-six pages of it. I recommend it for anyone interested in the process of writing and certainly for anyone interested in literature within the framework of gripping historical events.ul what you wish for\\"--because the author's realisation of 'Best-Sellerdom' has been granted at a terrible price.

B008RV5K5E|5.0|I'm a huge Batman fan. He is, without a doubt, my favorite hero in the DC pantheon. That being said, my favorite story arch is The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller. I first read it about 4 or 5 years ago, and I have been hard pressed to find a better graphic novel. It's dark, emotional, and provocative. Bruce Wayne is not a nice man, and he is finally at his breaking point. I always wanted an adaptation of this graphic novel, but with some hesitation. I knew that an adaptation would be easy to mess up, so this is why I approached this film with a lot of apprehension. I am happy to report that the crew over at DC has done a bang up job of bringing my favorite Batman graphic novel to life. Peter Wellers does a fantastic job of portraying an old and grizzled Batman, and Ariel Winter is great as Robin. The animation is top-notch, and the music is amazing. All in all, this film is worthy of carrying the title of The Dark Knight Returns. I am glad that they decided to split it up into 2 parts. A 90-minute or 2 hour adaptation would have had to sacrifice many things from the graphic novel, and that would have hurt the integrity of the source material. Highly recommended to Batman fans, and highly recommended to fans of the original graphic novel. Hell, I hope they consider adapting the less-spectacular-but-still-great sequel, The Dark Knight Strikes Again.

1594481717|4.0|This is one of those books that, as I read it, I kept quietly saying to myself, \\"yes!\\"<br /><br />At times, I felt like Pink had been inside my mind when recounting certain anecdotes, or drawing certain conclusions. So, take this review with a solid dose of confirmation bias in action.<br /><br />Throughout A Whole New Mind, Dan Pink looks at, and addresses, issues of interest, dare I say passion, for creative thinkers and knowledge workers the world over. Sure, for those folks, it's pop psych, pop sci, self-affirming stuff. But for the creative knowledge worker - those of us who rely on our minds as our most powerful tool and source of inspiration - Pink has drawn together many of the burning issues and biggest (even wicked) problems and dealt with them. He offers us as a community a number of ways to deal with our often complex and frequently misunderstood work styles, personalities and obsessions.<br /><br />A Whole New Mind isn't a cornucopia. It leaves more questions unanswered, and matters glossed over (this isn't a negative, by the way), than it adequately deals with. But as people who work with our minds, we ought to be able to deal with that, right?<br /><br />If knowledge work, solving problems and uncomfortably wedging yourself into corporate life is your lot, it's definitely worth your time and effort to read this.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is a great book, but it is sadly the end of the trilogy, at least that's what we're told. It definitely needs a follow up, but a great read nonetheless!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Inventive, original and compelling, this near-future series about a civilization living in a silo kept my attention throughout.  Characters are kept lively, but not so much that they detract from  the story. The author has a good sense of what keeps social order despite harsh conditions.
B003ITZBVS|4.0|DC made the comic book come alive. As far as adaptations go under the Red Hood can't be beat. The animation and the art style fit the gritty atmosphere of the story like a glove. I was disappointed at first that the movie lacked the tighter more intricate plot of the comic arc. (think some of the later Harry Potter movies.) But they did keep the weight and the driving force behind the characters alive and strong, particularly in the last few minutes of the story. In retrospect the comic book was such a hit with fans because it managed to bring out a different a side of Batman in a powerful and believable way. They definitely achieve that in the movie version. It did take me a while to get used to anyone but Kevin Conroy, and Mark Hamill voicing Batman and the Joker, although Bruce Greenwood, and John Dimaggio did fill the roles well. Jensen Ackles' portrayal as the Red Hood was especially good. Any Batman fan whose read the comics or watched Batman the animated series on cartoon network will love this movie.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Didn't know what to expect but now it's one of my top 500. That's a good thing. I really like this album, its slightly hypnotic and sexy cute, even my 2 pre teens give it thumbs up.
B008SVFX96|5.0|I still remember hearing my first Bon Jovi song, and just got sucked into the song and then the band. The Solo was just awesome, and thats when Richie Sambora become my favorite guitarist, still is to this day. Whether it is \\"you give love a bad name\\" , \\"Ballad of youth\\", \\"dry county\\", \\"hard times comes easy\\", \\"Every road leads home to you\\", and the list can go on, the songs have always had a great impact on me. Now coming to this album, I was wondering how Richie would approach, which route will he go. After hearing the opening track \\"burn the candle down\\" which is a great way to start a rock album, to the last song \\"world\\" which is just a great track to close the record, i was very happy to see the new album is on the right path of R&R.  My fav track on this album is \\"seven years gone, every road leads home to you, Learning how to fly, Burn the candle down, Weathering the storm, taking a chance on the wind & now days\\". The other track are good too, but the earlier mentioned track are personally my favorite. For me this is a really great album, would recommend it any one who likes good rock & roll album. Richie stands out very well on his own, the previous two and now this album show's that not only is he a awesome guitarist but a a great singer and song writer. So far my fav album of this year and my fav Richie Sambora album. Looking fwd to seeing him in concert.
0393080269|5.0|Ruchir Sharma distinguishes himself from the herd of pundits repeating their discredited drivel by explaining why and how finding the next undervalued region works in the real world. See if his views are as insightful to you:<br /><br />The short version:<br />1) Failed theories are based on straight line projections- if a county's growth was the same or increasing over a decade it will continue at that pace.<br />2)\\"Emerging markets\\" all rose during the last decade due to the massive debt bubble. In the future only certain provinces and countries within a category will be prosperous.<br /><br />3) After a decade of a growth bubble, 2 decades follow of negative or little growth.<br />4) Wall St. darlings rise for a decade, coast on their reputation for a decade, and then go into permanent decline.<br /><br />5) The style of government has little to do with the opportunities. It is the quality of the individuals in that government who set policy.<br /><br />The longer version:<br />1) Countries which begin growth after a war, depression, or a change in economic policy will grow rapidly but as their prosperity expands the growth will slow percentage-wise even while growing dollar-wise. Ignore percents and invest based on where the dollars are. India has slowed to 6% and China is under 8% and both will decline.<br /><br />2) Some Indian states have increased their wealth substantially. A few others are starting from such low levels that they will look like they are powerhouses. The countries with \\"soft Islam\\" like Turkey, Indonesia will do a lot better than \\"hard Islam\\" like Saudi Arabia. Europe and Russia will do poorly while Czech Republic and Poland thrive with low debt.<br /><br />3) During the last decade commodities and the supplier nations did great. Now he expects hard times for Russia, Brazil.<br /><br />4) Japan boomed and now has had 2 decades of stagnation. He expects the same for the US. The Nifty-Fifty, high tech, insurance, banks, airlines, auto all showthis pattern.<br /><br />5) Of 124 countries with higher growth, it is about evenly divided between authoritarian and democratic. Human rights advocates and policies in the US have had little to no impact.
B004XQO90O|5.0|This movie is reminiscent of \\"Sunset Blvd.\\" (William Holden, 1950) in that the narrator is already dead.  In the present case, a dead man's brain is being used in an experimental project.  The experimenters are trying to analyze a train wreck using the last 8 minutes of a dead passengers memory. Got that? OK, so what happens if the experimenters are able to prevent the train wreck from happening (inside the dead passenger's brain) - and - what happens to the experimenters and their project if the train wreck never happened??

0345525558|5.0|While this book was in parts was painful to read, I loved it. It was so sad sometimes, my heart went out to Victoria.<br /><br />I have a special place in my heart for stories that involve adoption or foster children. My heart broke over and over for Victoria, every time we learned she was rejected, every year it seemed until she finally went into a group home, no more chances at a family.<br /><br />So it shouldn't be surprising that she doesn't know how to trust or make a family. How can she, when no one ever gave her reasons to trust or to be loved? She has a hard time communicating with others as well, and finds solace in flowers.  When she meets Renata, a florist, her life begins to change, slowly, bit by bit.  She reconnects with a boy from her past, Grant. And from here the story takes some surprising turns, some happy, some sad.<br /><br />You find yourself really rooting for Victoria, this girl who went through so much but survived.  She built a fence around herself for reasons that are understandable. But when circumstances change and she has reasons to take them down, will she? I wanted to skip to the end to find out, as I sometimes do, but this time I let the story play out.  And I was happy I did.
B0053O89IS|5.0|I loved watching this season when it was on tv the first time and kept many of the episodes on my dvr so i could watch them over and over and cant wait to get my copy of the dvd so i can watch it whenever i want.  i can't believe where they took the season but i loved all of it and have loved the first two episodes of the new season 8... cant wait to see more!!!
B008NCSZQ8|2.0|I really, really liked the movie Thor ... and I did like the entire cast of this movie, but the movie itself was really boring and dull. It took a LONG time for the story to get going, but even when it did I still found it hard to keep watching. There was a lot of bickering, but not much fun or humor, though towards the end there were some fun lines.<br /><br />I didn't like how I couldn't hear what anybody was saying unless I turned up the volume almost all the way, but then any shouting or music or noise was SO LOUD. The story line was dull. I didn't care about any of the fighting. I usually like actions scenes like that, but this time I just kept thinking PLEASE END and get onto something else. Maybe they just went on too long. The fight scene in the forest seemed pointless and ended with them just suddenly back on the ship with the bad guy. How did that happen? Did my video skip over something? Or maybe I missed something because I couldn't hear it. They also talk to each other by speaking into the air. I never saw a microphone or anything. There was too much computer generated stuff so it seemed very cartoony at times. And too much Hollywood physics. (I don't mind either of those things, but this was too much of both.) I really wish the hulk could have been played by a real person though. I never liked computer hulk. The incredible hulk was one of my favorite TV shows, but some of my least favorites movies.<br /><br />Overall I thought the acting was great and the cast was great. I really thought I'd enjoy this and I know most people love it, but I don't.
B0092SQBJA|5.0|Phenomenal record - but really couldn't expect anything less from this group.<br />I'm sure this will be on repeat for a while!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The story that is in this book is great!  One of hope and healing and a battle of the lighter and darker sides of life.  The characters drag you into their lives right away.  I knew I would read all three books as soon as I started reading the first.

B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Being a huge Walking Dead fan (both of the comics and the show), I bought this DVD a few days after it was released, and since I'm an Amazon Prime member, I took their offer for free 2-day shipping. Boy, am I glad I did. I received the order quickly, it was packaged nicely and securely in a box, and the DVD itself is awesome. Personally, I don't get why people are saying season 2 was too short - there has to be character development somewhere and I feel that season 2 did just that. If you're a fan of horror, suspense, drama, and can handle graphic detail, I suggest you check this show out! You won't be disappointed! :)
B004LWZW6U|4.0|Well as long as you know going into this movie that it is supposed to be cheesy you will be ok. This is an ideal popcorn movie for the simple fact it is funny, cheesy, and plenty of boobage (come one who gives thumbs down to that). Not a bad movie to add to your 3D collection, although I have seen way better 3D in other movies this one adds to the \\"popcorn\\" movie effect. I gave it three stars because it is a good piece to watch with a couple of friends while drunk or drinking, or hanging out. For the price you cant say no to this one. A watchable cheesy fest with boobs galore.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is great it will last and never end even has things you can buy. It even has some pretty tough objectives but you can do the forever running glitch like on the I Pod touch.
B007SGM084|1.0|I am sorry to have wasted my time on this dribble. It is amazing what a little \\"hype\\" can do to sell books.<br />This book is written so poorly and the story is bizarre.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|OM GOD!  I have been reading Stephen King for over 30 years and I will repeat what most people are saying-it's his best so far!  Just enough Sci Fi to keep the SF readers happy and yet a REAL human love story.  Love of friends, family and others in the future, past (even if it is obdurate) and more importantly the HERE and NOW! It is also a story of acceptance. Jake Epping(George Amberson in the past)learns that accepting the present (because it is just THAT- a gift) and not trying to \\"work around\\" the past and future, is what is going to make him the happiest. The story of how he does this is amazing a quite poetic!<br /><br />I am not a reviewer that gives folks huge pieces of the story with my thoughts (I'll leave that for others) but I can't press enough that you don't have to be a Stephen King fan to like this book-BUT when you read this book you might become a Stephen King fan!

B003LXSY60|5.0|I was late on the Black Keys train. I've only heard a few of their albums, but from what I can tell they hit it on the head with this one. I liked the mellowness of it, but apparently they switched directions on El Camino due to the mellow tracks being harder to play in live venues. Such is life.
B008S80P38|5.0|Really I have a few of his albums and all are great in my opinion.<br />He always is taking his music in new directions, and that is a good thing.

B007L3BMGA|2.0|This book caught my curiosity since so many seems to be reading it, so I bought it to see what the fuss is about.<br /><br />I can totally understand why people like it, but for someone like myself who has read a lot it is easy to see that this is an easy-read... Even among sexy literature this is only decent to me.<br /><br />The grammar is bad, sentences so all too often poorly put together and, God forbid, she has not killed her darlings. Using words like \\"Oh my\\" this and that all too many times in every chapter...<br /><br />I did not like it.

B008N5UX9M|2.0|I did not expect an Iron Maiden clone, but given the credentials of the main songwriter and the engineer, I expected a well-written and well-mixed album.  British Lion is neither.<br /><br />I wonder how British Lion is considered a solo album as there were indeed mixed songwriting efforts, which quite frankly are weak.  This album has more of a band vibe and, if they had any hopes of getting anywhere beyond this initial release, would need to jettison the singer, as he just adds a weak, constrained voice on top of poor songwriting, all mixed in a pile of mud.<br /><br />There is no doubt that Steve Harris is Maiden's backbone, but lest you think he is everything and Maiden's other band members do not matter, then listen to this album and you will clearly see that Maiden is the sum of its parts.  British Lion does not add up to much.  It was a side project... and we'll leave it at that.
B0099G3I96|5.0|I never wanted to use the word sold out when it comes to No Doubt, but I really do miss their ska-centric tracks! But the positive is that even after such a long hiatus they were not interested in filling up the album with a bunch of hit list rap/pop stars. No, they have taken Push and Shove in a completely different direction. They are paying homage to the great music they grew up with in the 80's! You can hear it all over this record and I appreciate them for that, I respect them even more now! I would almost say they have reinvented themselves on that premise alone. So what you get is a band who have grown up and are just interested in making feel good pop music sprinkled with a little bit of that classic No Doubt sound that made us fall in love with them in the first place. It's not overly produced, so you can enjoy Tony, Gwen, Adrian and Tom together as a band without the mess. That's what they are all about.<br /><br />And thank God for that because No Doubt still has their musical integrity and that alone makes this record shine for me!<br /><br />Stand And Deliver is my favorite track. In the spirit of Oi to the World and that classic No Doubt of the Tragic Kingdom days, I just would have loved to hear a few more tracks like it! Edit: After listening to this record over the past few months my favorite track turned out to be Push and Shove. It's definately heavy ska with just a slight dance beat.<br /><br />Dreaming the Same Dream sorta reminds me of those romantic 80's tunes by Erasure and OMD. I think they captured the 80's very well on this record!<br /><br />Over-all still a very happy No Doubt fan and their musicianship is flawless. Tom's guitar solos and intros are beautiful!!!
B0000042MY|5.0|What awesome music, from the moment you put it on until the end, very haunting, yet you can't stop listening...So glad I bought it!!  It makes me want to watch the movie again!!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|It's really pretty simple,  you tap the screen four times and 4 coins fall onto the board. These coins along with assorted prizes are pushed down a chute for you to collect. While it is an ok game to pass the time, it is not challenging enough for me.<br /><br />Also, if you want more coins you will have to buy them with real money. Doesn't seem worth it for such a simple game.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|This little thing works just like it should. I have not had a problem with it. It's a simple device that has pretty intuitive controls (if you read the instructions).<br /><br /> The only thing that bugs me about it is that it's a bit unwieldy once you've connected it to the MP3 player with the included cable and then plugged your headphones in as well. It would be nice if the company had included some kind of a system to bundle the player and amp together as one.<br /><br /> Nevertheless, it's a nice item for a reasonable price.<br /><br />Edit - I feel the need to add my frustration with the only major con I can find with this item. It doesn't have auto shutoff so if you forget to turn it off when you're done with it, it'll be dead as it can be the next time you need it. A single charge lasts a really long time but it doesn't charge fast. It probably takes about 3 hours plugged into USB.<br /><br /> This irritates me to no end because my PC has weak volume and my headphones are AKGs. They demand an amp with this computer as the source. I can plug in a USB cable and listen while I'm charging but if you do this with this amp, you'll hear a pretty noticeable buzzing sound in the background that'll drive you nuts.<br /><br /> It's a shame because this thing is otherwise quite good. My AKGs are actually on the lower end of their line and I didn't even know they could sound as good as they do until I got this amp. The boost it provides for higher impedance headphones really packs a punch. And the sound quality is actually good on the flat setting. I didn't expect that.

Green day had been walking out there musically where they needed to say that the system was wrong to the masses through their music with American idiot (2004) and by the time 2ist century breakdown (2009) was released, they kept on going that path where rock opera was their \\"thing\\" at that time. Green day proved with both albums that when they wanted to take things seriouly they could do it without hesitating at all but, with this being said, they had forgotten their punk vibe on a record to  be established.<br /><br />I do believe after listning to UNO that the following releases for DOS and TRE will go on the same direction as this one but including some elements that Green day has known how to manage properly (piano, strings arrangements and stuff) but what I could identify right away with UNO is that they sound so fresh and excited. They seem to be comfortable going back to where they always belonged and, the best part of this record is that you HAVE TO listen to it all the way through. It is as addictive as Dookie (1994) was but maybe not as complete as that one. Songs like \\"Nuclear family\\" and \\"Stay the night\\" are pure punk but definitely so far my favorite is \\"Carpe diem\\"... it is soooo good. \\"Let yourself go\\" is so fun and addictive as well as \\"Rusty James\\". The way this album was recorded seems to be in MONO but I can't be sure about that. What I do know is that the raw and natural way the songs were recorded makes Green day to be sound as a punk band from the 70's by moments (no intentions to compare them with the Sex Pistols or anything here).<br /><br />The band is ready to make some noise again. Give them a chance to listen to them with the 90's vibe back.
B008MM9630|4.0|fun and addicting game. cute graffics.  only thing I don't like is having to spend actual money to get anywhere in the game. other than that it is great.
B003VDXTWE|5.0|I found David Garrett through the most unlikely venue...geocaching.  He released a travel bug that I picked up in Arizona.  I had never heard of him, and after checking out his music, I now will not forget him!  The promotion was for his new album Legacy, but I am starting with Rock Symphonies.  It's awesome to listen to on a run!  I will be buying more...
B0094M2O7C|5.0|Great movie. i love how they never kill the story. leave it open for a next movie to make more money...overall good efects but story line could have been beter.
0525421033|5.0|If I Stay alternates between Mia's flashbacks of her life and her out-of-body experience after the accident, watching her friends and family react to what has happened to her, her parents, and her brother. We get to see snippets of her childhood, her interaction with her parents and brother, and the evolution of relationship with her boyfriend, Adam, and her best friend, Kim. Meanwhile, we're also in the hospital, seeing how Adam, Kim, Mia's grandparents and other extended family members are coping. And through it all, Mia has to decide if she's going to succumb to her injuries or fight for her life; if the experiences she hasn't yet had are worth the pain of the world she'd be returning to.<br /><br />This book hurt to read. While Mia is a bit of a detached narrator, it was still devastating to view the scene of the crash through her eyes, and to experience each of her revelations with her throughout the book. But although there is lots of sadness and hardship in this book, there is also joy and humor. Mia had an overall happy life. She had parents who loved her, a boyfriend who was devoted to her, and friends that cared for her. She had a creative outlet in the cello that the people in her life may not have totally understood, but still supported.<br /><br />In a way, that happiness made what happened to her that much harder to read about. Her losses were large and meaningful, and it made it easy to understand why she would debate whether or not she wanted to return to a life that had been stripped of so much. There was no clear-cut right or wrong answer, and no matter what she chose, it would have made sense. It also makes her ultimate choice a double-edged sword. I simultaneously agreed with her choice and regretted, along with Mia, what she gave up by making it.<br /><br />The few annoyances I had with this book were actually not problems with the book, just bits of added realism for the characters. While Mia adored her parents, and they loved her fiercely, as she looked back on her life, she would reflect on some occasions with her parents that she thought were awesome and I thought were questionable parenting decisions. But of course, that's because she's a teenager and these are her parents, and I'm an adult, and a parent, so our perspectives are going to be very different. (Of course, that also has a lot to do with your personal parenting -- and life -- philosophy, and we all know there are as many of those in the world as there are people. So other parents may think Mia's parents are the epitome of parenting, and that's fine too). There were also a couple instances with Adam in flashback that made me raise an eyebrow or two, but again, I understood why they made sense for the characters.<br /><br />One of my favorite aspects of the book was the use of music, and how Mia, her parents, and Adam were all musicians, albeit very different kinds. Whenever Mia was talking about how she felt playing the cello, or about how her parents or Adam talked about music, I continually thought, yes. This is how musicians think (while I'm not the virtuoso Mia is, I still have a musician's brain). It made me want to go watch cello videos on YouTube (because there are some awesome cello videos on YouTube), or to sing, or to dust off my piano music. I loved how they all related through music, and while they approached it differently, they all understood that the music was the important thing.<br /><br />If I Stay is a powerful and introspective look at life, love, family, friendship, and how everything we know can change in an instant. It was beautiful and haunting and sweet and sad, all at once. It's not like any other book I've read, and it stuck with me for a long time after I turned the last page.<br /><br />[Oh, also, I have no idea why the cover blurb says it will appeal to fans of Twilight. While it definitely could appeal to fans of Twilight, it is absolutely nothing like Twilight, except that it features a teen female protagonistwith a boyfriend.]with a boyfriend.]
B008C1O8CA|4.0|I'm gonna make this review short and sweet: This album is \\"Warning\\" as remade by Foxboro Hot Tubs. I really can't sum it up any better than that, and Green Day fans should know exactly what to expect by that description.<br /><br />Not their best effort and not their worst, but I'll take mediocre Green Day over most other bands' best albums any day of the week!
B008RV5K5E|2.0|25 years after the publication of the most important work of a popular superhero ever, and all the buildup to its long-awaited adaptation, its just . . . a letdown.<br /><br />From the laughable Leno-esque chins to the lack of crucial voice-overs (which had worked SO WELL when you had Bryan Cranston voicing Jim Gordon in Batman:Year One), to the terrible fight animations to the terrible added dialogue . . . everything that could go wrong, did.<br /><br />Peter Weller was great, and they used some iconic stills from the comic, otherwise it was hard to watch. Whenever it should've been brisk (the news shots), it was too long, and whenever it should've breathed (the first issue scenes), it rushed.<br /><br />Of course, this all comes back to the decision to forgo any voice-over, which is probably the biggest mistake in this entire production.  Its simply not possible to do the story justice without it.  The first issue (which will always be the most important to me) has almost as much \\"thought dialogue\\" as actual spoken dialogue, from the main characters.<br /><br />Sorry, but if you gut the best part of my favorite comic, I ain't buyin.<br /><br />This would be a great death . . . instead its a sad imitation.
B00006ZSAD|5.0|Possibly the best album of all time. Takes the decades of woe of a single human life, adds the achingly beautiful melodies of  centuries of ballads, with the millennia of human voices altered by sorrow and finally mixes in lonely nature sounds accompanied by creepy little choral samples and \\"Out of Season\\" casts its shadow over your unsuspecting heart. These tender poems are saturated with bleakness by Gibbons' voice and the ghostly sparseness of the acoustic instruments.<br /><br />The pain begins with \\"Mysteries\\" with the lines \\"When the time bell blows my heart/And I have scored a better day/Well nobody made this war of mine.\\" \\"Romance\\" claims, \\"It's plain to see all the things we suffer/ at the hands of humanity.\\" When she sings \\"Summer skies are leaving me behind/like a circle, life is ever moving by\\" it's less an autumnal afterthought than the realization of a soul damned in \\"Resolve.\\" The lyric is full of pathos; it's almost a suicide note set to the most romantic tune imaginable. \\"Spyder\\" continues this meditation on suffering as Gibbons whispers, \\"Time is but a memory/a bitter note unsung/running, trying to find salvation/from the sorrow that is done.\\"<br /><br />And so it goes until it spends itself in tears and silence. By then, however, you have been transported to the island of the dispossessed.<br /><br />UPDATE 2014: I made made the mistake of listening to this seasonal requiem today, November 25, when I noticed the earth had tilted and a certain slant of light had fallen over the Los Angeles Skyline. Gorgeous as all get get out, but am now left with quite a wet weekend feeling! Though I've been listening to this CD for12 years now, I've only recently put together more specific insights. I only just remembered what this album reminds me of: my favorite poem from college, \\"Spring And Fall To A Young Child\\" (1880) by Victorian Jesuit Priest, Gerard Manley Hopkins. Out Of Season comes from the same wellspring of sadness, a realization of one's own mortality embodied by the change of seasons:<br /><br />Margaret, are you grieving<br />Over Goldengrove unleaving?<br />Leaves, like the things of man, you<br />With your fresh thoughts care for, can you?<br />Ah! as the heart grows older<br />It will come to such sights colder<br />By and by, nor spare a sigh<br />Though worlds of wanwood leafmeal lie;<br />And yet you will weep, and know why.<br />Now no matter, child, the name:<br />Sorrow's springs are the same.<br />Nor mouth had, no nor mind, expressed<br />What heart heard of, ghost guessed:<br />It is the blight man was born for,<br />It is Margaret you mourn for.<br /><br />Secondly, the craft of Out Of Season is wicked good once the structure of some of the songs becomes clear. In \\"Sand River,\\" brightly colored Fall leaves are ironically the color of a death pall: \\"Autumn leaves/beauty's got a hold on me/Autumn leaves/pretty as can be/shadows are drifitng in silence.\\" Then Gibbons actually coos \\"water colored memories,\\" the most schmaltzy, cliched lyric ever written (from Barabara Streisand's 1975 song, \\"They Way we Were\\"). It's a wink to the listener that the song is self-reflexive art; Gibons & Rustin Man are letting you know that not all these woe-begones are dead serious. Some are mocking the \\"super-sad song.\\"<br /><br />It also signals a deeper struggle. If one knows that one is wallowing in the mire, that's a layer of emotional removal used as protection; sometimes self-consciousness doesn't allow us to fully feel the devastation, and that, in and of itself, is a sort of sad.hange of seasons:    Margaret, are you grieving   Over Goldengrove unleaving?   Leaves, like the things of man, you   With your fresh thoughts care for, can you?   Ah! as the heart grows older   It will come to such sights colder   By and by, nor spare a sigh   Though worlds of wanwood leafmeal lie;   And yet you will weep, and know why.   Now no matter, child, the name:   Sorrow's springs are the same.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|The jack reacher all the fans expect. Not the Tom cruise joke of a production! Let hope the author never compromises in his novels.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I'm about half way through this one and already think it's his best yet. Lot's of deductive reasoning by all the characters (not necessarily real world, but Reacher never is).  Body count is low, but half the book is yet to come (it will go up!)<br /><br />Highly recommend.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I really like this game. Could be a little faster in refilling coin meter. Overall a decent game for free.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|good<br />good game kindle fire controls work ok graphics good just basic hack and slash worth what I paid for it.
B008PE9GSA|5.0|For me, there is not too much that can be said about this band. I have enjoyed every album and have also purchased Billy Gibbon's gearhead book. These gentlemen know what cool is and they can crank it out on a CD. I have been a big fan since the get-go and I will continue to send them invites to my BBQs! On this album, I think they are right on the center of their original sonic idea... deep fuzzy Texas rock blues. I hope they keep working, they are a core band in my collection.
B007FEFLTO|1.0|I wish I had read the reviews before paying $20 for this book.  I'm only a third of the way into the book and I'm forcing myself to continue because I paid so much for it!  Maybe I enjoyed the first book more because I listened to it on Audible,  but this follow-on is a huge disappointment -- boring,  stereotypical characters,  poor writing and plot development -- what a disappointment!!  The author has turned into a hack and the publishers are GREEDY!!
B00723NWJE|5.0|Norah Jones new album is an utter masterpiece to me. It is what \\"Rubber Soul\\" was to the Beatles; a complete change up in musical direction for the better. I've always respected Norah for her talent and unique voice but I could never find myself being deeply devoted to her albums until I heard this masterpiece. While I enjoyed her first two albums, the farthest I could ever go as far as listening to them is to just check her out occasionally. This is due to the slow tempo of her early work. In other words, I can't see myself listening to Norah Jones on my way to work or as i go on my daily jog because her music was too slow for me. The only time i could listen to her is when I was reading my morning paper and having my coffee in the morning. Before this album came out I always said to myself, \\"One day this girl has to make an album that rocks.\\" Finally! It has come.<br /><br />I came about hearing this new material when I was at the the Outside Lands Festival in San Francisco 2012. I went to see Norah perform telling myself, \\"I'll listen to 4 songs and then go to another show because I know she tends to be a little mellow.\\" Mind you, Metallica and Stevie Wonder were also performing and they were more of the energy I was looking for but when I went to see Norah...SHE COMPLETELY ROCKED THE HOUSE!!!<br /><br />First she started off her show with the classics from her first two albums then she declared, \\"We're going to perform some songs from my new album...produced by Danger Mouse.\\" I thought to myself, \\"Danger Mouse? That guy is an amazing producer and one of the last good hip-hop artist around (contemporary hip-hop is a disgrace to music and poetry). Loved his album with MF DOOM. Can it be? Is Norah going to rock the house?\\" She opened up the new set with \\"Say Good Bye\\" and I was completely rocked out of this world. I was so moved by the music that I wrote down the lyrics to \\"Broken Little Hearts\\" and told myself I had to check this new album out.<br /><br />I told everybody how amazed I was with Norah's new stuff and that it sounded like I was listening to The Doors but with Norah's voice. I was completely breath taken by her new stuff. When I went online to check out the new album I purchased it immediately. She finally did it. She made an album for my kind of crowd. I always respected Norah for her voice but like I said I couldn't get into her like I wanted to because I needed something with more rhythm and edge. I love jazz but I'm not into country so I couldn't get into the albums when she delved into the country side of things but \\"Broken Little Hearts\\" is revolutionary in my eyes. It shows her range as an artist and has made me revisit her earlier work with more appreciation. It an industry that is plagued by hacks like Lil' Wayne and Britney Spears \\"Little Broken Hearts\\" is a breathe of fresh air and I love it. It sounds so surreal and as stated before reminds me of the Doors but with a female spin on things.<br /><br />My favorite songs are \\"Say Goodbye, Happy Pills, After the fall, Broken Little Hearts, All a Dream, and Miriam.\\"<br /><br />Thank you Norah. Thank you for making an album for me and expanding your horizons...I look forward to your next album. You really are a true artist in the spirit of the Beatles, Stevie Wonder, Sade, Michael Jackson etc. etc.<br /><br />I also recommend her album \\"Featuring\\" as well
B002MGJOBQ|5.0|The music in this version (the Director's Cut) is different than in the version that is also available. I love the way the \\"human interaction\\" is portrayed within the family.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book- I think you should be ready for a story of redemption, and awakening. I loved that it spoke to me who is not even close to their age, but could relate because who doesn't want to 'walk out of their life\\" in a sense, for all the right reasons not to abandon anyone but more to find one's self. The beauty of this story (like so many others) is that the protagonist doesn't really know what he's setting out for except that he has this \\"urge\\" that doesn't really leave him, and to deny it (as he's denied so much or been unconscious of anything else) was no longer an option.  I loved how the book made his journey, his wife's journey as well-- showing that everything we do affects the people we love and each one of our own \\"personal\\" journey's are not really our own-- we learn (or don't) the old adage that it is always the journey that matters and not the destination (i know it's old cliche but that's why it is) - most lessons come from the arduous steps to get an answer (whether it be math, or life)  -- rarely from the end itself. I don't know if this makes sense, but I loved the book.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|It was difficult to trudge through all of the statistical stuff (who cares) and the math.  Seemed to drag on and on.  The plot lines are becoming a little tiresome these days.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|I really enjoyed this trilogy. As a woman in my 30's I watched the movie with some thoughts as to whether I would enjoy it or not, knowing that it was designed for young adults. I found the movie OK but somewhat lacking and knew straight away that the books would fill in any gaps in the story that the movie hadn't touched on. I was not disappointed. I found the whole trilogy well written and thought provoking. The characters and the places were well described and although the love-triangle was a wee bit annoying at times, it added to the suspense of the books. The only real issue I have with the story is that it's finished.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love the Majong Artifacts game. I only started playing recently but find it very entertaining. It has an interesting story-line and new and different tiles that appear every level. The background music is nice. I wish you had a printable tile list so that guesswork wasn't involved with some of the matches.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I saw a skit about this British show on Saturday Night Live.  Was curious about it and watched the first episode on Netflix and got hooked on the series.  We couldn't wait for Netflix to add Season 2 so were delighted to find the DVD available on Amazon.  We got to catch up and now can't wait for season 3 to start on PBS in January.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I like the product because it has easy design to work with, and it came with the accessories that you need to work with any device that you like to listen music with mp3 cd player, iphone, and itouch. Also, I was able to use it with a external portable speaker.<br />When you have a very good pair of stereo head phone i.e Dr. Dre studio beats and Bose head phone the sound is very good. The built in equalizer is good too.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Not since Harry Potter have I read a book where I enjoyed the building of the characters and the unfolding of the story more.
1401937519|5.0|This book was recommended to me by my brother, to help me in my healing.  I lost my 35yr. old daughter 2 years ago to Lupus and I too have been diagnosed with Lupus and reading this book really helped me to understand the root of my illness.  The account of her near death experience was so awesome! it was so like the experience my daughter had prior to her death.  This book took me on a journey to a place of healing for my own health and well being.  Great Book! A must read for everyone!!!
B008XG1X18|3.0|Used on my Kindle Fire, the app freezes probably 2/3 of the time I open it, requiring a force close. I enjoy the design fitted to the screen, but the freezing makes the experience less than enjoyable.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|just downloaded. not bad. fun options and entertaining. been playing on kindle fire and graphics are clear. for a free download, worthwhile!
B0063GORYU|5.0|great game. i have had several hours of fun from this game. for a free app its great. try it.
B008H6GHL0|5.0|At first i was confuse as to why the lickers was control, but thanit is unfold later in the story. Besides that, Capcom did a good job on cleaning up after PUAL. Pual who just mess up the live action movie. RE damnation is a hell of a ride. U WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|i would have given 5 stars if you could get the green money without actually buying it. and i prefer to finish building without having to involve friends and beg them for stuff.
B005LAII3U|4.0|Seriously... Obama's face on currency?  I hardly ever speak out in a movie theater.. but that sight caused me to blurt out \\"Bullsh*t\\" quite loudly.
0066620996|5.0|I thought this would be a good book, but a boring one.  I was totally wrong.  It has ideas that i think everyone has wanted to yell out at some point while at work, and backs them up with solid research.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|Mr Child is getting kinda predictable and somewhat unrealistic.  This story line is somewhat too fantastical, if that's a word.  I like the \\"badass\\" guy story line, but it's gotta be somewhat \\"possible\\".  This story line is now bordering on science fiction.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I thought the game was very fun. once I got a lot of buildings money just came fast. so it was funner once I got in the flow of things.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|I have waited for decades for this adaptation. The source material remains my favorite piece of comic art ever. The only thing missing here is the internal dialogue. If you aren't familiar with the source,by all means read it and then get this. Many thanks to the people responsible for getting this done.<br /> Now-how long do I have to wait before part 2 is available?
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this is a wonderful app to have, very accurate and very happy with it<br />I use it on my tablet
B00004R99F|4.0|Funny and great movie. I loved it as a kid and I still love it... The songs are great too
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love it ..very addictive ..I can't put it down. I am sad that this review is taking me from it
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Just loved Season One, so excited to begin Season Two. It is such a wonderful series both in terms of the storyline and the quality of the production. I hope it never ends.
B004G7FFF8|5.0|How about a bargain, I started collecting individual CD, collected 17 disc, which cost me more than what I have paid for the box set (99 CDs).<br />It is a true delight, Liszt a piano Master and Howard brilliant Interpreter. Must have.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I got the free version and loved it so much that I bought the premium version!  The variety of sounds and music enables you to create your own personal soundtrack.  You can layer different tracks to create melodies to meditate, relax, sleep, or just provide some background to everyday life.  I am not one to need sound to fall alseep to, I'm fact I usually prefer silence, but this ap has converted me!  It helped tremendously this week when my two year old was sick and having a hard time sleeping.<br />It is also a very beautiful and easy to use ap.  I brought my Kindle to work to show some of my friends and students ---they are fans now, too!
0812992784|5.0|sir<br /><br />the book is very fine and Mr Rashdie is going to be renowned world writer. In India, some did not rate him to be world class writer, now this book is certainly a reply to them.the language is very easy and natural and the plot of this is connected to world history. It is one of most noted novels of Rashdie- Midnight Children, Satanic Verses.<br /><br />ks chaturevedi<br />mathura India
B0087HT36U|5.0|So far i think it's better because it's easier to aim and the levels aren't so frustrating (yet at least). I can get the gold crown in a few tries, that's perfect. And it has a new spin in the peasants you have to protect. I hope it doesn't get to that point where it's more work than fun. I love the skeletons with armor, very funny.
B0086700CM|5.0|its the best game ever and I play it all the time every one should play this game it helps with hands and eyes work together
B007GCY8FS|4.0|This was not my favorite story. Probably I know Jack too well and have started taking him for granted.  I do love the way he sees the highway life in America.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I just like playing wi my friends and guess what they're drawing its just so fun. also I really enjoy drawing and having my friends guess what inn drawing
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I always enjoy the Reacher series by L.Child. However, A Wanted Man was way too much into<br />the details of Iowa & Kansas topagraphy. It dragged on & on throughout the book. Too much<br />unnecessary info. I also think a significant part of the \\"believeability factor\\" was missing<br />in this one. But I still enjoyed it and will continue to follow Reacher whenever he appears<br />in a new book.
1476712042|5.0|I'm not sure why this book had so many bad reviews!<br /><br />This book was very well written. The main characters (Travis and Aby) were very likeable and you will find yourself cheering for them to make it. Even the friends and family members were all intriguing as well.<br /><br />For the people who are \\"offended\\" by Travis's behavior...please crawl out of whatever shell-shocked sheltered 1950's life you are living in. I'm not sure why people read these kinds of books then are shocked my what they entail. Find something with Fabio on the cover if what you're looking for is the sappy romance stuff. I don't like those types of books (gag) so I don't read them and then post bad reviews...I just DON'T READ THEM.<br /><br />The book was super intense and very romantic. Grabbed my attention and held me till the very end...I read the entire book in one night (who needs sleep right??).<br />Anxiously waiting for Walking Disaster!!!!!!!!!!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I read any and everything I can find by Lee Child. His Jack Reacher novels are da bomb... haven't read a bad one yet..
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is a fun game that will take you back to the days when arcades were still really big. there is nothing complex about it and there is nothing wrong with that. gambling without the money!!!
B005721W9O|5.0|Brilliantly written and casted!  One of those truly rare movies that you enjoy watching over and over again.  I have watched it at least 6 times since it was originally released and still laugh out loud!
B0002J4X1Q|4.0|If you have a thing for zombies, the plot for R.E. 1-3 is extremely impressive. 4 and 5 are still good, but plot lines do not transition well.
B004EPYZPS|2.0|\\"Super 8\\" is essentially \\"ET\\" on steroids, but while it's produced by Steven Spielberg it lacks the emotional force of a Spielberg movie.  The characters aren't really likeable or credible, making their many attempts at creating emotion uncomfortable to watch.  Despite Abrams' reputation for spinning a good yarn, there isn't much of a story here.  All in all, this is a very bad ET re-make, and everyone would be better off re-watching the original.
B00846REIS|5.0|In full disclosure, I own every last Sylvia Day book that can be had for my Kindle, so yes I am what you could call a FAN. But don't let that deter you from hearing my message that you definitely want to read this book! This is the story of a very naive young woman swept off her feet by a very attractive and dominating man into a world of total unknowns - seemingly endless money, sex (vanilla and otherwise) and the loss of her independence. Gideon Cross and his seriously alpha male self is my favorite personality in all of Sylvia's books - and that's a tough ladder to climb. Eva surprised me with her gumption and ability to adapt quickly to the F5 hurricane that is Gideon. Read the book - I'm sure you will agree! This book will make your thighs sweat - so have a fan and a cool beverage nearby. You will also gain an appreciation (if you don't already have one) for women who stand by their man.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a great book to wrap up The Hunger Games trilogy.  I had a hard time putting it down once I started reading. The author does a fantastic job of making you feel like part of the story. You feel for Katniss and the pain and confusion she experiences being the icon for a rebellion among the districts. The author keeps it real, detailing bombings, shootings and the affects of war on children. I love all 3 books in this trilogy and highly recommend all of them.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|From start to finish in one weekend. I couldn't put it down. Love my dog and cant imagine life without him now.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Once I started reading this book I couldn't put it down!  I loved the first one The Hunger Games but was skeptical about a follow up book. Wow was I surprised!  It picks up right where the first book leaves off and continues the lives of Katniss and Peeta. I highly recommend all 3 books in this trilogy!
B0087HT36U|5.0|I cant wait for more levels. Lots of fun and challenging. This game is very  addictive, i had a hard time putting down my phone. Great app. Thanks.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Awesome ! I even got my grandson playing &amp; husband! Need more acorns that are afordable and get easier ...more space!
B008JJM88Q|5.0|It kept me up until midnight lol.  Had fun, sometimes it's amazing how fast it could guess right, but even when it couldn't I still had fun and was laughing. Thanks! :D
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I played it once on my ffriends itouch and I didn't like it. went home aand found the game was free so got it downloaded. I started playing it for a while and I got addicted to it
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Loved the Iron Man movies, loved Capt. America & Thor. So I wondered if The Avengers would make the cut. I knew it would either be a huge hit, or a huge flop. Well, it was a HUGE HIT! They brought together all the Avengers perfectly, such a great cast! And they finally got the Hulk right in Mark Ruffalo. Plus, great screen writers! Just a great movie all around!! It definitely set the bar for the summer block busters!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very interesting and informative reading.  Enjoyed the book from cover to cover.<br />I would read another book of this quality.
B007SGM084|5.0|This was the best trilogy I have ever read. I have never read anything like this before and I couldn't put the books down. I am just disappointed that I finished them. I hope the author writes a 4th book. As a matter of fact, I read them through twice. A friend of mine is on her second time around too.
B008S80P38|5.0|Deadmau5 has made an amazing album with his diversity in this album. The mixture of featured artists really makes this album stand out. Some of the album resembles 4x4=12, but is so different at the same time. Some of the songs have been released on previous EP's or at the Meowington's Hax tour. The design of the physical album is amazing. You also get exclusive album content available to download online, once it verify's your copy of the cd. I highly recommend buying this album to any one thinking about buying it. And if you do, buy the physical copy!
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|I really thought this movie was going to be some corny family movie, but I found myself laughing out loud several times. Totally unexpected! It is a great action/adventure movie for the family. Both my kids (goy -12, girl -9) enjoyed it thoroughly.
B008RV5K5E|3.0|The best part? I thought the sounds and music were pretty good.<br /><br />On the other hand, I thought the art at times was ugly. The Mutants and their leader looked fine as where some side characters. They are in the \\"spirit\\" of Frank Miller's art from the comic. Other characters and scenes for that matter not so good. There were some excellent visually dramatic scenes from the comic which for the most part they failed to capture. I also didn't care for how Bruce Wayne and Robin looked.<br /><br />I thought the drama and emotions of some scenes were lost. When Batman finally confronts Two-Face in the comic Harvey Dent is just not a crazy person, but a deeply damaged individual who in spite of his psychosis is pitiable. This was not conveyed well in this movie. I thought the dialogue and delivery was weak at times and I wasn't too crazy about some of the voice actors. I like Peter Weller as an actor (he's great in the \\"Naked Lunch\\"), but he wasn't working for me as Batman and neither was the actor doing Harvey Dent. As far as Bruce Wayne's internal monologue from the comic that other reviewers have referred to, yes its a shame they couldn't include that. However, to be fair that might have been very difficult to do. Still they could have made up for some of that by having Batman talk to himself out loud a little more, because that interior dialogue from the comic really reveals much about the inside of the Batman. How he is equally damaged and obsessive as some of the criminals he chases after.<br /><br />I have to say the whole effort feels a little stiff and not as natural as it could be. The comic was a classic and had an obvious influence on later Batman movies. The comic was very 1980's (culturally and time period) which in this first part they don't really place the time period well. The comic also had some fun with the culture at the time which I think so far is lost. At best this feels like a mediocre effort to bring this story to the screen and when it succeeds its more due to the source material than anything the producers have done. I hope they make a better effort in the second part movie, which doesn't bother me that it was split into 2 parts as the story is fairly long. If I were to grade it I'd give it a B-. If you are a casual Batman fan you may enjoy it more than a fan of the original comic.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I advise all to read this book written by a retired navy seal. I am a vet and totaly agree with all that is said in this book. We are fighting a war with our hands tied to the whims of the politicians in Washington. excellent!!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I can be pretty picky about what I read. I was debating on buying this for a few weeks, and I am glad I decided to!! It was so good that I could not wait to get into bed at night to read it. Also if I had a few minutes throughout the day I would read it!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|When I was unable to carry my bible due to injury, this ap on my phone and kindle kept me in God's word.  The only addition I would like is a concordance. it is hard to find a scripture with a word or phrase using this ap.
B005LAII80|5.0|First off, let me say that I am biased to this particular comic book character.  I've been a fan since the late '80s and have wanted a film adaptation for a long time.  I am not saying that I am pre-disposed to like this film.  In fact, quite the contrary is true.  I'm not only coming at this from the point of view of somebody who wants to see a good movie, but as somebody who will be judging this by its adherence to and respect for its source material.<br /><br />I've been disappointed before.  The Stallone version of the '90s failed this test on both counts.  In fact, the only thing that movie got right was a few beautifully rendered hyper dense scenic shots of Mega City one.  This film didn't have those shots.  In fact, the scenic shots of the city didn't seem that dense at all...yeah there were tall building....but spaced far apart.  It seemed almost like a quaint small city trying to be a big one at the edge of a dessert.  That is...until we are taken inside the city.<br /><br />This is one of the real coups the film pulls over on us.  A few quick shots of the area around these mega blocks (big...REALLY big...More then twice the size of the Twin Towers big) reveal some familiar (especially if you are a New Yorker) buildings that frankly look like kids toys in comparison.  When we are informed that the city has over 800 million people covering a land mass that stretches from Boston to DC, you have to intake air when you realize the true scale of the shots looking at the city from the dessert.<br /><br />We are quickly given a day in a life type story focusing on two characters who have an importent yet oddly impotent job in the city.  To maintain order.  And it doesn't take too long until we realize how futile that task is in a city so enormous.<br /><br />The plot details are somewhere along the lines of a Die Hard film from that point on, but the feelings this setting evokes in us are more akin to District 9.  It's an all together beautiful and disturbing combination the filmmakers utilize quite adeptly.<br /><br />At some point we are inside one of these big blocks, and the Judges (a hybrid cop/judge given powers to dispense instant justice) we are following through their sadly ordinary day had to shoot lots of people and utter caustic lines like \\"Defense noted\\" or \\"you have ten seconds to comply\\".<br /><br />Did I mention lots of people get shot?  Well... let me put it this way:  LOTS of people get shot.  And we are not spared one ounce of gore when this happens.<br /><br />The film never really lets up, rather it moves at a brisk pace as our protagonists go about their job.  The titular Judge Dredd is the experienced mentor, putting Judge Anderson through the ropes here.  For those of us familiar with the comics, these are the two biggest characters in the world of Mega City one.  While Anderson does go through changes, this film gives us a bit of her origins (placing this story actually BEFORE the comics really take place).  While she goes from barely competent and wishy washy cadet to the beginnings of the kick ass PSI Judge we all know and love, Dredd himself never breaks a sweat.  In fact, you get the sense that this particular day was no better or worse for him then the day before or the day after.  His actions in the last scene of the film really hammer this home.<br /><br />This characterization is what really makes the film work.  The sense that this is the norm in this city informes us of the prevailing fatalism that must soak into every citizen.  It is a very bleak dystopian view of the future, that sadly looks all too understandable and real.  We are never told how the human race came to be in those cities, or why they still exist there.  It's only that they ARE there.  And it's left up to us to fill in the importance of that.
B007RI56NY|5.0|I absolutely love this album.  Every song is outstanding.  Usually when I buy an album, I find myself fast forwarding through several of the songs but not with this one.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this calculator is awesome! it shows the equation to the answer right under it and then if you click the equation it shows a history of your past entries.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|I have read every single Jack Reacher book and this one does not disappoint. I read it in one sitting (household chores, family needs and sleep be damned). The only problem is when the last page has been read I am always left thirsting for more. It's a long wait until the next book comes out. Also, I just don't see Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher. He's only 5'7\\" and too pretty.
B009B51K9U|5.0|Fell For You, is one of my favorite songs off this album... i think people need to stop putting boundries on bands and what type of music they can do. Just opened you mind up and listen. That is what I did and I loved it. I have been a Green Day since 1994, and yes this album was a surprise, but i do think this goes back to their roots, and adds a touch of their side projects. I cannot wait for the othe albums.
B006ATJXQW|4.0|it would be good to read the other books after this one and not before like i did. But it was still good in every-way that i was expecting
B004RJMUJO|4.0|so I really like this app but does it really need to know our contacts data???? SERIOUSLY?!?! word. word. word.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved the whole series. This book got better after chapter 7. It really pulls you in. I am sad that it's over after 3 books.
B002M5E2DW|1.0|I must have clicked this by mistake and DID NOT want to order it.  I hope that it has been credited to my account as I requested about a month ago.  This is not right that I am getting this review...  please make sure it is OFF my account like I assumed.  Thank you.
B000B8IA2G|4.0|While this is only the first season I have yet to say how I really feel about the series in general other then it's alright, while you have a new enemy for these wayward explorers to contend with you can see some of the clone like character backgrounds with some of the characters especially Shepard.  While Shepard is no O'Neill the character and actor are still decent enough to keep you entertained along with most of the cast as well.  While one or two seem unneeded again this is only the first season so maybe later on in the series some of these background characters will get some more screen time to see if there needed on the show or not. The biggest con and negativity I have for the show was the unneeded but apparently wanted super model looking actress with limited acting talent Rachel Luttrell who plays the character Teyla Emmagan whose character was probably the most annoying and unlikable of the whole cast.  While the wraith is the newest enemy for this franchise you can pretty much tell how much of a substitute they are for the Jaffa from the SG1 series and while they pose a viable threat for our daring group they just don't seem to pull off the feeling of being the threat that the G'aould  and their Jaffa army were. The series is entertaining to a point still and worth a look especially at the price the sets are going for eight now but remember to keep an open mind if you expect too much of the series to be like SG1 then you'll feel some disappointment.
B0099G3I96|5.0|I dont know why someone would want to be cliche on a review, dont listen to those single star whiny babies, but I had to check out the reviews this morning to see what people had to say about this album and was a bit sad. I myself have won prizes for my very few reviews listed on Amazon. Granted I bought the delux eddition from Target, Tuesday at lunch, listened all afternoon at work (I have the best job ever!), wasnt sure what to make of it but once I got home at 5 I was in LOVE!!! What a wonderful colaboration of music, the sounds are so unique to their style and I love the choice of Gwens lyrical notes. The references they make to that special something 'hint hint' on Push and Shove, similar to Start the Fire is what makes me love them that much more. Cheers to them! :-D My favorite lyrics on the album so far are:'anytime anyplace we blaze'-Push and Shove. 'curiosity, a cat up in a tree, want you to get me down, but Im scared of what I'll see'- Undercover. 'Put your hands up your surrounded, theyre circling me, cuz I'm a hustler baby, come on, I'll bring it up and turn it off. Anonther day gone again without you, gotta get it while its good, I know I'm robin my hood'-Easy. This IS music to my ears no doubt, they is a true insperation to me. And whoever wanted to hear a remake of tragic kingdom just remember it can never ever ever be the same. Pure No Doubt.
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|This. Book was slow boring and not a pleasure to read. I wish I just returned it when I realized it was a dead end.
B008DVJO8C|4.0|Haven't bought a cd in roughly 10 years because it was always a disappointment and a waste of money.  Normally you get 2 out of 12 songs that are worth listening to but this album really surprised me.  \\"Blood\\", \\"Whore\\" and \\"Adrenalize\\" make this cd.  The album has about four other good songs in the middle and kinda slows down at the end.  Its actually a tolarable cd from start to finish which is rare these days.
B007SGM084|5.0|I kept hearing about this book from friends and it seemed like everyone was reading it. Sooo, I decided to purchase the trilogy for my kindle. Glad I did! It's making for some wonderful conversation with my husband (My Christian Grey!). :)
B0091REZMW|3.0|So far li find this game relaxing yet still keeps me interested. I hope they live up to their hipe.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Great movie, stunt exciting, Tom still has the juice to hold your attention! Great to see Ving Rhames again wish he was in the movie a lot more .
B0038AUY96|5.0|it has a dark and melancholy mood pervading the novel like a mist.it satisfies the reader by keeping him on the edge.  a refreshing change from the usual american thrillers that always seem to involve the high and mighty living in new York or Washington or somehow manage to involve the president( or even worse) his family.
B002APU580|5.0|I bought this for my teen-age daughter not sure if she would like it or not.  She loved it.<br />Has since read the book and watched the movie several times.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I was disappointed with this latest Lee Child book - there was a lot of descriptive writing that didn't appear to help the plot.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love it<br />It is awesome site. Love how there is a place to find so many wonderful ideas and how to's in one place.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Love this app! It is truly the most useful app on my Kindle Fire.  Totally free. easy to use. and very helpful. Highly recommended especially for high use devices.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I had lost my kindle fire HD, in the MarWare case, off the top of my car where it was run over at least once. I retrieved my kindle later with nothing but a few small punctures in the case and the kindle in full working condition. I do not advise that you run over your kindle, but know that it will be safe from outside forces. Great buy!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I am not a great book reader and probably am not a fan of science fiction books, but this series of books was so engaging that I could not put it down.  I think seeing the Hunger Games movie gave me the push to read and stay engaged with the first book.  After that I was hooked.  My only regret is that there are no more books to read now.  If you saw and enjoyed the movie you will definitely enjoy these three books.  I hope reading the books will not spoil the second movie, which I am guessing is destined to come out sometime in the future.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I really love these types of books and the characters could really exist; maybe they do!!<br />I am looking forward to the sequel that I will purchase when I am done with this book.  Thanks
B0087HT36U|5.0|I think this game is better than angry birds if u ask me. It is way easy to aim and shoot. .99&cent; is worth it.
B003VS0CYC|5.0|I've seen these on dvd and on blu-ray, and no matter what u still can't get a movie from the 80's to look like it was made yesterday. Not gunna happen so stop your gripping. I think the blu-rays still look good, and considering the price I got em at 15.99 i can't complain. It is a must have set even if Robo 3 is well should be burned.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|it is pretty good.  but after a while it just gets boring.  I would recommend it to someone else.  After a while though, I would uninstall it.
B0080BFVPU|5.0|I love this movie. I have it on dvd, but had to get it on blu-ray. All time favorite movie.

B007GCY8FS|3.0|I've read every Reacher novel and pre ordered this one with great anticipation. Unfortunately I didn't find it as engrossing as previous novels. Unlike his best, I was able to put this one down for days. Is it awful? No, but I can't really recommend it either. 3 stars.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I had to read this book since everyone was talking<br />about it no matter where you were. For myself I found<br />it to be such a different genre than what is the usual<br />reading norm. I thought the characters were quite<br />unbelievable and the dialogue very raunchy. Friends<br />had warned me of the content and stated that Book Two<br />was indeed better. So I did manage to get through<br />Book One in high expectation that they were correct!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I loved the books and though the movie versions never capture the entire book I think they did justice to the story. Visual effects were stunning.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Book Two was a definite improvement from Book One.<br />You could begin to understand the characters and<br />story line better. I was intrigued to finish so<br />I could go on to Book Three.
B002MCJZHS|5.0|I love listening to this album while driving at night.  It just feels so right.  It plucks the strings in my heart so melodically and it makes me feel so nostalgic.
B007MDB71O|5.0|A film destined to be a cult classic.<br />  Let's go back to 1877 when Giovanni Schiaparelli \\"discovered\\" canali on Mars.  Misinterpreting the word to mean canals, popular writers and even scientists around the world began to think in terms of life, intelligent life, on Mars.  Life that could build huge, planet spanning canals to bring water to the arid desert of the planet.  Another astronomer, Percival Lowell, took up the baton and began to observe Mars in earnest and for years before and after the turn of the 20th century, speculated on the probability of life, life that he thought could be intelligent.  In the meantime, H.G. Wells penned a novel about invasion from Mars.  \\"War of the Worlds\\" became a best seller and inspired a huge outpouring of fiction about Mars.  Edgar Rice Burroughs added to the fictional Mars accounts with \\"Princess of Mars,\\" which was so popular it spawned eleven sequels with the same principal characters, John Carter and Princess Dejah Thoris.<br />  Mars had caught the public fancy and the love affair of the public with Mars has hardly abated even to the present day.  Burroughs's Mars is a wonderful place.  In 1917, when \\"Princess\\" was penned, flying machines were rare on Earth.  But they were already being prepped for war.  Burroughs caught on to this and made the Martian fliers fabulous weapons.  And \\"fabulous\\" is a key word here.  Burroughs wrote a fantasy, not a science fiction novel.  He was aware of the fact that gravity on Mars is only slightly more than a third of that on Earth and therefore gave John Carter leaping ability... but way more than the lesser gravity would actually allow.  He is almost a superman on Mars.<br />  Burroughs's novel was written near the end of the Edwardian era.  War clouds had precipitated actual conflict and the war was on everyone's mind.  There was war on Mars, of course. But the book is an Edwardian romance with beautiful women rewarding heroes with their favors.<br />The plot of the movie, though it does not track exactly with the story of \\"Princess of Mars,\\" actually captures the atmosphere and essence of Burroughs's so perfectly it is impossible to find fault.  The story is Burroughs.  The characters are exactly what Burroughs delineated in his novels and they are well played. His wonderful tharks look exactly as the reader envisions.  The flying machines are insect-like and adapted to the Martian gravity.  They ride on sunbeams (solar power?).  For anyone enthralled with Burroughs's stories, the movie is so evocative, it renews your sense of wonder.<br />For anyone not familiar with Burroughs's novels, come with me back to 1917 and experience the world that Burroughs saw in his mind's eye.  Visit Mars of that era with its canals and old civilizations, a dying world of turmoil and danger, needing a hero from Earth to make things straight and to win the heart of the Martian princess.  A great and splendorous film and one to enjoy many times.it does not track exactly with the story of \\"Princess of Mars,\\" actually captures the atmosphere and essence of Burroughs's so perfectly it is impossible to find fault.

B008XX6J92|5.0|OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG ...  WHERE TO POSSIBLY START???<br /><br />  These are not just unreleased songs, these are beautiful treasures of which every Barbra fan will rejoice upon hearing.  The nuances in her voice will give you the chills, the ease in which she sails into a note with that angelic soprano, she is just incredible.  These are each little chunks of Barbra history!  To listen to them now and realize that some of these songs were recorded over forty years ago, one realizes just how wonderful these arrangements are.  Each one of these gems is just phenomenal.  There is no like like Barbra Streisand, and there probably will never be anyone that ever comes close to her magnificent achievements.<br /><br />  There are no accolades that have not been showered upon this lady ... and she deserves every one of them.  Magnificent is too puny an adjective to use here.  There's also a reason that every performance by this remarkable woman is followed by standing ovations.  And now, with Release Me, there are eleven more reasons to stand up and shout!  Thank you to Barbra and the team behind her for sharing these incredible songs with us all!  This album is remarkable...  wow...!!!

B007GCY8FS|3.0|I've read all the Reader novels, and I do believe it's time to retire the aging hulk (and the downsized Tom Cruise version). The FBI agents in this novel were beyond believe. (Spoiler) The FBI would never place a female agent undercover with a 10-yrear-old daughter, especially in a national security investigation. And Mr. Child's dig at America's love affair with guns in chapter 30 hit a nerve. Our love affair is with liberty. Liberty is guaranteed with citizens' right to bear arms. Ask the Swiss.

B0083SBM7Q|3.0|I love this film.  I bought the blu-ray/dvd combo because, while I do not have a blu-ray yet, I wanted to see the deleted scenes & the gag reel.  When you check the comparison page, it says the combo has all of the special features found on the 4 disc set.  Imagine my surprise when the dvd has none of those special features....they are only on the blu-ray disc.  The dvd has only audio commentary & a feature about the making of the film.<br /><br />I am not pleased.
0060763280|5.0|Harv Eker introduces an interesting concept that we all have a personal \\"blueprint\\" in our minds about money and how it should be handled. The idea is that during your childhood and growing up years you absorb the attitudes about money from the people you are surrounded by and many of your thought patterns and spending habits were picked up during these formative years and influence how we handle money now. Eker's book talks about how we can reset that blueprint and create success for ourselves.<br /><br />The second part of the book is titled \\"The Wealth Files\\" and discusses seventeen ways rich people think and act that are different from the poor and middle-class levels of society. He basically puts forth that if we can change our thinking patterns and think like the rich, we will become rich.<br /><br />I really felt like I could relate to this book in a very personal way. All my growing up life I had people pressuring me to make money, but they couldn't show me how because they did not know how to do it themselves. It led to lots of family arguments and being put down to the point of feeling like I wasn't worth much because I couldn't make any money. This book helped me regain my self-worth and gave me many practical ways of reprogramming my thinking and actions so I can be more successful. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to be successful. It was an eye-opener for me and very helpful. -- Valerie Lull, Author, Ten Healthy Teas

(granted I did overclock my pentium from 2.93 to 3.5) and this thing works excellent. CPU stays under 105(F) even under heavy stress testing such as prime 95. Fits in my case with room to spare.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|I think this was a very captivating book!! It really keeps you reading and really makes your feel as if you are there with Sarah. Loved the way the author incorporated the present with the past.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|not just the kindle. im still waiting. please make it available for all tablets. Sorry for the 1 star but will add 5 stars if its available for all tablets soon
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Fast moving, interesting subject matter fully packed with action and suspense.  When I had to leave it I couldn't wait to get back.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|This is my new favorite novel. The characters are well-developed and the masterful use if language gives each narrator/protagonist a unique voice.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|The book seemed to be lacking continuity; could have connected eras more smoothly.  Subject matter was not interesting to me.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I have really enjoyed the Reacher character in the past, but I was so disappointed in this latest.  A lot of school book information that didn't help the plot and the characters weren't likeable - even Reacher seemed asleep at the wheel.  Maybe it's time to write about a short, goodlooking, athletic guy?  Sorry Mr. Child, you can do better!
034580404X|5.0|Good reading if you are into something different.  Really not as much \\"sex\\" as your Penthouse or Playboy magazines.  Yes it is descriptive but not as descriptive as it could be.  Great store if you just look beyond the sex.  The writer seems to change with the 2 and 3rd book or maybe they were bored.  Not sure, the 2nd & 3rd books were not as good as the 1st.
B008F5YDRI|4.0|I wouldn't say it was the best fishing outting I've ever been on though it was certainly entertaining... enough to recommend to a friend.  Great cast.  Well directed.  Perfect length.
1609611543|5.0|Excellent book.  Great recipes to use and valuable information.  My daughter wanted this book.  Her doctor put her on a gluten free diet and recommended this book.  I loved flipping through it and ordered one for myself.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I read a lot of little known authors who publish through amazon. I've found well, I can't really think of any that are at the level of this book. It's writing is just dang good. The main character is a great read, strong, but with flaws, and sometimes you love him, and sometimes you want to kick him in the butt, but your always interested. The cast of other characters are as equally as wonderful, even the not so likable characters I ended up loving, and always full of surprises. Take this review as a person who has over 3000 fantasy fiction books under his belt. This is a good book, and really worth the cost of admission. Keep your eye on this author, he's going places.
0812993292|4.0|What I liked most about this book was its capacity to surprise me. It starts off as the tale of an ordinary, quiet, beaten-down retired Englishman who does something totally out of character when he decides to set off walking to visit a former co-worker dying of cancer. At first, I thought the story was going to be a cliche'd tale of a mousy man and his domineering wife. But this book constantly shifts back and forth. Soon the wife's inner life begins to be revealed as well. Anyone who has dealt with non-expressive, seemingly unemotional people will relate to the wells of emotion that lie beneath the surface of the characters. The author creates just enough mystery--about the elderly couple's relationship with their adult son, the problems that drove them apart, and the nature of the relationship that drives Harold to walk to Queenie's bedside--that you are drawn on to find out what's happening. Along the way Harold gains a new outlook on life. The surprises continue up until the end of Harold's journey, which I won't spoil, but suffice it to say nothing turns out exactly as you think it might. The writing will make you picture every step Harold takes and feel like you're walking along with him. I could totally picture this as a movie starring Jim Broadbent or similar British actor. Well worth the read.
B0087HT36U|3.0|good start, but will not work on a tablet(nexus 7) can get annoying after a bit.  hate games you have to buy extra crap
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love it is addicting and it is herd to stop playing when you've started playing haha ha ha blab blah
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I like this game it reminds me of a carnival game. Just like what you would play at a carnival only you do not have to spend money. This game is very fun and passes the time away. You also become addicted to the game. The only downfall is you have to wait for more coins.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this app! Its really fun and There are so many puzzles to choose from. I could spend hours playing it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Engrossing first hand account of the Bin Ladin mission. A real page turner, long on action and tactical details, equipment descriptions, and  spec ops comraderie. Nothing classified and totally dedicated to the soldiers who carried it out perfectly.
0307730697|5.0|This has to be one of the best books I have read.  When I finished the book \\"Lone Survivor\\" I though that was the most moving story put in print. Now,  I am hard pressed on which has influenced me the most.  There are so many special people that have served this country and given so much.  Adam Brown is one of those hero's not only in battle but in life that stands tall among them.  However,  there is another hero in this book that to me is equal to Adam. Kelley, in her \\"fearlessness\\" and dedication is and inspiration just as much.  She stood by Adam when he could not over come his problems when most women would have left.  Her faith and commitment is a standard rarely meet.  I feel so much sorrow for the family and those that will miss him.  I found my self saying the same thing that others said when Adam was killed.  NO NO NO not after all he has been through.<br /><br />One verse comes to mind when I ask \\"why?\\" Isa.  57:1 \\"The righteous perish and no may lay it to heart: merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come.....\\"  We do not know what would have happened to Adam had he lived a longer life.  God always knows when it is time for one to leave us.  May the life and death of such a man inspire all who have known him and read this book.  God bless you Kelley and your children.
B0086700CM|5.0|this  game. is really fun. it rocks . temple. run is not hard at all.  I'm hayley. and this game. rocks
B0091REZMW|5.0|I play it on my phone and kindle; it's great on both.  Creative hidden object play.  Visually it's fantastic.  Blarg.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I was immediately caught up in the intricate plot of this drama. Damian Lewis, Claire Danes and Mandy Patinkin are excellent.I regret going through the series so quickly because now I'll have to wait quite awhile before season two is available on Amazon.
B001H5X7KC|4.0|Crude, foul-mouthed, offensive, often revolting... oh, I forgot to add downright hilarious, not to mention clever (the trailers for coming attractions that actually begin the movie, just for starters). As other reviewers have mentioned, unlike so many other comedies, the trailer for this one did not contain all the funny parts, not by a long shot. Thank goodness writer and director Ben Stiller took no PC prisoners. Anyone offended by this film deserves to be. Stiller, Black, and Downey are wonderful together, and there is a terrific bit, virtually a cameo. by an almost unrecognizable Tom Cruise.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Perhaps it's just me; I tend not to like continued stories and at this point I do not plan to order the third book.  The second book was just more of the same (as the first), with more crises stuck in there to make it seem exciting.
B007PVHAN2|5.0|Bob Marley was a guiding light.  A Spiritual Leader on a level of Ghandi.  Without looking to do so, many people were drawn to his words and music and lifted their spirits and their lives!<br /><br />This movie tells this story very well!
B001DM1VXE|5.0|Pi is a strange movie. I've now seen it 3 times and finally understand the plot.<br /><br />As a person who has suffered from migraines all my life, it is unnerving to see such a<br />painful and accurate portrayal of these horrors. The reason I had for seeing more than once was to vicariously view my own pain. Migraineurs are like that sometime.<br /><br />I thought the banker was portrayed accurately in her shark like pursuit.<br /><br />It is odd, depressing, but I thought our hero's solution was a good one.<br /><br />God bless all migraine sufferers, but don't try this at home.
B008F9VCC8|5.0|I was looking for a book to read when my friend challenged me to try The Maze Runner. He said it scared him to death, but to me it sounded interesting.<br /> When I started the book, every page left me dumbfounded and wanting more. The shear suspense and mystery kept me reading. All I could think about was Maze Runner. It made me tell everyone.<br /> The book is about this young boy who gets sent into a maze to survive with other 12-18 year olds. They have no memory of anything except their first name. They live in the middle of the maze with 300 ft. doors that open during the day and close during the night to keep out the monsters.<br /> This book is for kids 12-up because of the violence and suspense that may be too much for kids. It was one of my favorite books in the whole entire world.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun way to pass  the time on a long car ride.  so far no problems with the app.  some very challenging puzzles.
B000XR4OC0|4.0|Toms<br /><br /> My first pair of Toms that I got was about a year ago.  After wearing them to school, friend's houses and other places, they are still in good shape.  I love the way they look, and feel on my feet.<br /><br /> Toms are very comfortable and flexible to wear everywhere.  They are so comfortable that I could sleep in them.  They're super light to carry and are small and easy to pack.<br /><br /> They come in lots of different colors and sizes; they have blue, pink, green, gray and lot more. One of my favorite things about them is that all Toms look different.<br /><br /> My only complaint is that they are not cheap, they're about 20 to 40 dollars, but they are still my favorite shoes.  They are for all ages and I've even seen boys wearing them.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|When I saw the trailer for the very first time I was so excited, being a long time Marvel fan.  Mind you I was mostly an X-Men & Spider Man fan for a long time as a child.  But as Marvel gave us Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Iron Man 2 & Hulk (though not in that order) I fell in love with the characters & was reintroduced to them all.  Joss Whedon did an amazing job with this movie & all of the actors have amazing chemistry.  Mark Ruffalo makes a very interesting Bruce Banner & Jeremy Renner's portrayal of Hawkeye is unique but amazing.  What I am dubbing the \\"Ultimate Edition\\" has everything an Avengers fan could ask for.  As soon as I get this I will be watching the hell out of it while I work on Halloween decorations & put together mine & my bf's costumes (Black Widow & Hawkeye respectively).  Avengers Assemble!!!!!  RIP Agent Coulson
B007GCY8FS|3.0|It seemed to me like scenes from several of the previous books linked together to make a new story .. I wasn't too impressed.
B0028MBKVG|1.0|Page after page of hype and nonsense, very little to help my running.  I was hoping to be informed, not entertained - better to read Paul Theroux for this type of entertainment
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I really like this app.  Really gets the job done. Very informative.  I will definitely recommend to my friends and family
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is really good and it's way better than on the iphone for sure this game gets 5 stars! :)
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Forever etched in the minds of FT fans is this short-lived British comedy series.  This 30th anniversary(!) re-mastered DVD edition crisply and faithfully delivers every complete episode containing all visual and aural gags written by the comedy team of John Cleese and wife Connie Booth.  The 30th anniversary DVD set edition is offered at a special value price.  Although Fawlty Towers is a superb period production, this immortal series delivers off-kilter insights on daily tribulations and strives to send messages applicable to today's viewer.  Indulge yourself, c'mon and buy this DVD set.  Be sure to listen to the out-takes and also view those episodes in which you can opt to listen to running commentary [delivered by John  Cleese himself] on the action, lines, and progress of each scene--as was intended or not.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Incredibly useful I use it all the time when I need to check battery life. Highly reccomend it for all ages
B000FCKC4C|5.0|As the author of [[ASIN:B005ZRV8GS The Pi of Life: Essential Truths for Creating Happiness, Wholeness, & Success in Life]] I love books that Motivate and Inspire! The Alchemist does both.<br />Like a river of light, The Alchemist flows through time. The story of a boy discovering his personal legend gives hope and meaning to everyone on its banks.<br />Each of us has a personal legend.<br />Are we living it?<br />That's the real question.<br />I'm working on mine. This book was the perfect teacher at the perfect time for me.<br />I love how Paulo Coelho blends wisdom and insight--about living our fullest potential--into the story. I had quite a few \\"Ah-Ha!\\" moments as I read The Alchemist and I recommend it highly!<br /><br />In fact, I'm going to read it to my children as a bedtime story too.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I'm a big fan of any jack reacher ,child's always gives  u your money's worth. Could not put this book down  nobody explains action like child's  the story plot keeps u guessing till well into the book. Great reading.  Can't wait till the next one. I read reviews that pan some of child's books.  I have never read a jack reacher book I did not.  You get to know reacher more in each read, I hope he keeps putting out reacher books.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|I must say I enjoyed this movie enough to see it twice in the theaters and also purchase the DVD.  Chris Hemsworth is definately easy on the eyes, and the visual effects were astounding. I ejoyed the story line and the humor throughout the film.  The dwarfs were adorable.....it had the stuff to entertained both the male and female population.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Best album of the year. Every song is absolutely incredible. I have listened to this album non-stop since its release.
B008XG1X18|2.0|App freezes constantly,  slow execution, server sends &quot;busy&quot; message at some point during EVERY session, poor quality app. Amazon can do better.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|I found this show in August and I watched every episode from season 1 to season 4. This season expands the shows character development with Walt and Jessie as well as Gus. It is a must watch and the blue ray quality is excellent.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|FANTASTIC!<br />Big Fish does it again. This was one great game! Graphics are unbeatable, storyline is terrific, player. friendly and works great on KF. All this for 2 bucks? I patiently,  or not so patiently. wait for part 2!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|It so easy to get caught up in the Jack Reacher series. Love the character, and all those surrounding him in each novel, just hate<br />for the books to end.  There is always the suspense, can't wait to turn the page feeling and then that I don't dare turn off the<br />light and go to sleep without knowing what happens next!  I have everyone of the series and will read them again starting from the<br />beginning.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|You can play for ever! However if you really want to get any where they want you to use real cash. You can earn extra coins and acorns by playing the fishing hole game. Pretty much I like play but I don't spend my money.So I don't get very far.
B009329Y30|3.0|This is a romantic film about a soldier, Logan (played by Zac Efron), who returns from the war in Afghanistan and struggles to re-integrate into society.  He found a picture while on duty that many start considering a good luck charm.  He moves to find this woman, and ends up falling in love with her and her family.<br /><br />The filmography and scenery in this film are fantastic.  No holds barred on scenic views of the countryside.<br /><br />Zac's character is rather emotionless (certainly not unknown for PTSD veterans), and the story seemed rather predictable.  Pacing was a little slow as well.<br /><br />I realize that many of the portrayals in the film are accurate for real life, such as the veteran and a jealous ex-husband who uses a child to get his way.  Life doesn't always move quickly either.<br /><br />However, even with \\"gritty realism\\" I think the movie could have been paced better with a few more surprises thrown in.  Overall a pretty decent \\"date movie,\\" but I don't think it would withstand many repeated viewings.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Often when I've read the book the movie is a disappointment.  That was *definitely* not the case with Game of Thrones!  I got totally absorbed into the characters and plot...even though I already knew it from the book...and wound up watching most episodes back-to-back.  Thoroughly enjoyable!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|well lets see, this knife came razor sharp, i know cause i cut myself on accident not bad tho haha just nicked myself. ive watched a couple vids on youtube where they had problems with the edge but even if it doesnt come razor sharp you can put n edge on it real easy and it lasts. all around great survival knife/ \\"edc\\" everyday carry in my opinon. shipping was fast did the free shipping deal.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It's awesome! So many great ideas! Some of these are so creative! I spend hours glue to pintrest searching for different things!
B00992CF6W|4.0|This app is great, like minecraft Pc. but they rushed into it. they should have it kept up with 1.3.2, and they should have not messed up the Gui from the iphone version. it is streached out, it is very annoying...
B0086700CM|4.0|I think it should be more detailed;but its a fun game.Also the people should be less money. I liked it and I would say its pretty good.
B001R3YRG2|5.0|Glad this finally got released with special features. The film transfer looks great, the box is cool. An amazing film/DVD all-around!
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Great read, inspiring story told in a personal way. And you get a few interesting recipes there too. Warning - this book will change your concept of 'distance running'
B008CJ0JPC|5.0|Reviewing the Criterion version of the film:<br /><br />David Fincher is my favorite director. Aside from his first two films, I've seen every one in order of their release and each film strengthen my admiration for his work. \\"The Game\\" would have been the 2nd or 3rd film I saw from him and absolutely loved it. I guessed until the last scene and was engrossed and excited for the whole thing.<br /><br />I had this film on DVD for a while. It was the United States release which had no features whatsoever, it wasn't even formatted for widescreen TVs (the anamorphic image was shrunk down to fit inside a 4:3 ratio). I did not have a laserdisc player for the Criterion laserdisc, nor did I have an all-region player to get the DVD that at least had commentary. Meanwhile, each new film would come out on a DVD that was not only packed with special features, but had amazing packaging too. I love the care and treatment Fincher's films get from beginning to being in the hands of a consumer. (The only exception being Se7en which took a while to come out in a special 2-disc edition, having me wait even after Fight Club was released).<br /><br />But even then... The Game DVD remained for me a not only boring but frustrating DVD experience without any features, with a boring, ugly case. Finally, Criterion came through and released a spectacular DVD.<br /><br />Commentary, 1-hour making of video comprised of several locations, each with optional commentary, storyboard to film comparison, teaser trailer and trailer with optional commentary, a booklet and a fantastic design for the case artwork. My ONLY issue with the casing is that the two DVDs sit atop one another. If you want to watch Disc 2, you have to take out Disc 1 to do so. Kind of a bummer having to remove both discs, especially for me who likes to keep a DVD in it's case as much as possible if I'm not watching it to avoid any scratches.<br /><br />Still though, so glad to have this DVD, even if Criterion decided to have a 50% off sale after I ordered it (boo!) But I'd pay almost any price for it. Because I love Fincher. I love The Game and I love the care Criterion put into their releases.
B00846REIS|4.0|This book was great. Day's wiring ability is far better than E.L. for those who are refrencing this to Fifty Shades. This is a good follow up to fifty. Its really exciting and it makes you never want to put it down. i read it in 2 days and am dieing for the next one to come out. this book is absolutly for adults only! but enjoy!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent read despite the political controversey-you will not want to put it down until you have finished the final page
1603427244|5.0|This book has a lot going for it: it lays flat, so it's easy to read while knitting: it gives instructions in writing and photos, allowing for confirmation of techniques; the writing is clear and succinct, so it's very straightforward.  Lovely.  I'd recommend it to any knitter, new or expert.
B003VDY7XE|3.0|I enjoy watching the first several shows but than it became to easy guess what was coming. I have nothing more to say.
1401322786|5.0|This is my new favorite book! Of course all you Mitch Albom fans out there already love him but this is a little different than his norm. Thought provoking, sensitive, and of course philosophical. Plus a quick read! LOVED IT!
B0081QZJ6A|3.0|I was excited for the new remastered Neil Young CDs.  I already owned 'Harvest' when I saw this box and figured I'd save money by buying the whole box. The box contains Neil's first four albums- Neil Young, Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, After The Gold Rush (my favorite!) and Harvest. The CDs seem to be the same as the individual CDs with one difference, and it's a doozy- Once<br />Again the labels rips off the fans: the CDs in the box do not come with any of the booklets. The remastered sets have very nice<br />Packaging but they decided to skimp on the packaging for this box. You get the cd and a slip that has the cover art.<br />Nothing else, no booklets- nothing, also the box set slip case is very cheap and flimsy.<br />I give this set 5 stars for music and 1 star for packaging.<br />Don't bother with this unless you're getting it cheap. By the individual CDs and enjoy the booklets.<br /><br />This review is 5 years old.  At the time this set was selling for over $50 and if you charge that you should give the fans a little more than a  bare bones set.  Now its dropped down so much in price, under $20, that it doesnt matter.  But would've it hurt for the record label to treat his fans a bit better by giving them replicas of the original packaging ?  If they price it high then the fans should expect more.
B00338QENI|5.0|Im twelve and I read this book and it was very informative, and interesting. If only other kids my age would read this instead of books like &#34;Go Tim, Go!&#34;
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book, while did not end as everyone probably wanted, was a fitting end.  It examined the perils of the returning soldier, did a good job of explaining the idea of how good battle strategy can go terribly wrong and how fragile the psyche can be.  The characters are pushed to what they believe their limits and then even further.  This is a good book and I enjoyed it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|We could have ordered this per episode, but then we wouldn't have a copy on DVD, so the few bucks extra were well worth it. After all, there are so many well-acted and intelligent scenes, it will be a pleasure to refresh once the memories fade -- like watching Casablanca or another great classic -- maybe the Star Wars triology is a better example - for the 10th time. Fans know the best lines.
B0090EIC3Y|5.0|Good movie<br />Quality was very good<br />Amazon has always provided me with a quality presentation of a movie. Most people can't tell that it is streamed and keep looking for the BluRay cover. That's what it should be.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Very well written and extremely interesting and enjoyable. A must read for everyone, no matter what your age. A reader's cultural necessity.
B0063GORYU|4.0|good simple game worth a couple of bucks but it's free<br />no surprises kept me occupied while the kid was at the Tutors
B008XG1X18|5.0|The greatest invention of a virtual scrapbook  and a vision board. It's been an inspirational springboard for most of my creative projects.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book really told the true story on how we accomplished a major victory on the war on terror. To comprehend the amount of time the US puts to protecting our home turf and what our elite soldiers go through is just remarkable. I have nothing but praise for the guys who never get any credit for their missions but are always protecting us, even while we sleep. I would recommend everyone read this book since it will be always remembered as a true victory for the US.
B008XG1X18|5.0|great app. I'm a pinner myself too. can spend hours on it pinning different diys and food thingys. my nails board
0143119680|2.0|Bloated, insipid mess with a blatant self-insert Mary-Sue as protagonist. Pretty much nothing happens and the book ends where a climax (which would have been the ONLY climax in the book) should have been so you have to buy the next book to find out.<br /><br />Do not allow this woman to profit while she plays out her fantasies on the page.
B00337KM2S|5.0|George Clooney stars as Ryan Bingham, a corporate down sizer (he fires people for a living).  He treasures his stockpile of frequent flyer miles, collected by spending over 300 days a year away from the office.  (Not away from home because Bingham has no home.)  His sophisticated contentment begins to unravel when he begins mentoring young Natalie, who has new ideas for firing people by computer.  He is further undermined when he meets his nemesis in Alex, a female version of himself.  This bittersweet tale captures you from the beginning and is sadly uplifting.
1451629184|5.0|Jaycee Lee Dugard was an innocent 11-year-old girl when her life was forever changed on the morning on June 10, 1991. It was on this day, as she walked to the bus stop within view of the home she shared with her mother, stepfather, and baby sister, that she was abducted by Philip Garrido and his wife, Nancy.<br /><br />Forced onto the floor of the car, Jaycee was secreted away to a soundproof shed on the property of Garrido's mother's California home.<br /><br />The fear and loneliness Jaycee felt in the first few days would slowly be overcome through manipulations of both her mind and body by an evil man for the next 18 years. The brainwashing so strong that it took the keen eye of two officers to finally force the words \\"I'm Jaycee Lee Dugard,\\" her ticket to freedom, from her lips.<br /><br />Now Jaycee talks about her abduction, her experiences at the hand of a repeat sex offender, and growing up a hostage in her July 2011 book [[ASIN:1451629192 A Stolen Life: A Memoir]].<br /><br />There are some who say it is too scattered and focuses too much on her cats, indeed it is and does. However, Jaycee gives fair warning in the beginning that she is not a polished writer and tends to jump from one subject to the next and back again with no warning; so is it fair to judge the book on something for which a reader has been warned? I think not and won't. But take it under advisement.<br /><br />In the beginning, Jaycee's story is hard to take; extremely graphic with nothing held back. Keep the Kleenex's handy, is my advice.<br /><br />As the story continues, readers can see the transition from little girl to a grown woman with children who suffers a form of Stockholm Syndrome. Readers are invited into her life through her cats (and there are many of them) and various other pets, as well as her children and job.<br /><br />When reading [[ASIN:1451629192 A Stolen Life]], readers must remember this book as much about regaining control of her life as much as (if not more) about sharing her story. It's not a just-the-facts tale, but a memoir and should be treated as such.<br /><br />To say that I enjoyed this book feels wrong, but the truth is I did enjoy reading about this remarkable young woman who managed to survive what many others don't. I think Jaycee is an admirable young lady and I'm pleased to endorse her book by saying read [[ASIN:1451629192 A Stolen Life: A Memoir]], a heartbreaking book with a very happy ending new beginning.t sharing her story.

B001C4AFOY|5.0|I rank this film with the best of historical movies.  Queen Victoria reigned for an amazing 63 years (surviving several assassination attempts).  This film focuses on her from age eighteen to her early twenties as she fights off the attempts to set up a regency, is courted by Prince Albert, begins her reign, marries Albert, and has the first of their nine children.  The film focuses on how  these two strong-willed young people, committed to one another and to their responsibilities, assume authority individually and as a couple over against many about them who seek to exploit them.  Emily Blunt is perfect as Victoria and is supported by a host of topnotch actors.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This book was so intense and was such an interesting story that I could hardly put it down.  It gave food for thought as Harold discovers things about himself and others around him.  Some surprises as well--!
B00275EGWY|5.0|The Hurt Locker, a war film directed by a woman, won the Academy Award for film and direction - perhaps because of the woman's touch that focuses on suspense rather than action, on personalities rather than events, and brings a new perspective to the war-film genre.  The movie is a riveting depiction of  the day-to-day life of the bomb-squad technicians who voluntarily risk their lives and challenge the odds to defuse roadside bombs on the streets of Baghdad.  Staff Sgt. James, replacing the man before him who was killed, combines a surgeon's skill with an occasional recklessness that drives his cover man, Sgt. Sanborn, nuts.  Sanborn does everything by the book.  I cheered when this film won its Oscars.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|game is fun, i like the multi point touch so i can use 2 fingers to get better times. tiles could be bigger but a really fun game. me and friends compete to see who has the better times.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|Capitalism: A Love Story is Michael Moore's best.  I kept applauding throughout  the film.  Moore's argument is less with capitalism than with capitalism's most egregious excesses in the U.S., mainly the greed of the banking industry and the gambling on Wall Street.  His ideal is not the end of private ownership, but more cooperatively owned businesses where everyone shares the wealth and makes collective decisions.  With clips from Ronald Reagan's old movies and days in office, Moore colorfully shows how Reagan's policies began our current economic decline.  The funniest moments are when Moore asks several bankers to explain what derivatives are.  All fumble and stumble.  Of course, derivatives themselves aren't funny.  For example, they  might involve bets placed on the expectation that folks will default on their mortgages  Perhaps the most horrifying account in the movie is of a judge who was paid for each  juvenile he sent to privately owned detention centers.  He happily  sent large numbers, many for trivial offenses.  Another horrifying moment is the segment on \\"dead peasant\\" insurance.  (Yes, that is what it is called.)  This is the insurance which companies (like WalMart) take out on their employees, making them more valuable  to the company dead than alive.  The heroine of the film is Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) who advised her constituents not to move if a bank foreclosed and to demand that the bank produce a copy of their mortgage.  In many cases, the banks can't.  The most encouraging moment is about the workers who protested Bank of America's refusal to pay wages earned.  The workers won.  My favorite image is of Moore using bright yellow police-crime-scene tape to block off the Stock Exchange.  I cheered!  The most inspiring moment is a clip of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, not long before his death,  proposing his Second Bill of Rights for Americans, calling for the right to homes, jobs, education, and health care.  What a tragedy that he did not live tocarry out its passage!  But it is there for us to carry out.  And that is the challenge of Moore's wonderful film.
B003K16P50|4.0|What an amazing story and very well written.However I would have preferred a happier ending!!A good read, I could hardly put it down!!
B004SEUJ82|5.0|The Holocaust obviously holds lessons that humanity has not yet learned.  Many fine films have explored those lessons.  This is one which expands our understanding through the eyes of Bruno, a small Aryan German boy whose father is promoted to become Commandant of a death camp.  Slipping out when his mother is gone shopping, Bruno walks through the woods to the camp and makes friends through the fence with a Jewish boy his age.  Bruno is not the only one in his family raising questions about the Nazi \\"solution.\\"  His grandmother and his mother, each horrified as they learn the situation, rise to a form of revolt.  This is a fascinating and powerful film.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Im not a reader but this book has me reading and wow what a story it just a experience that take you straight to the middle east
B002SF9YNO|5.0|This lovely Japanese movie won an Oscar for best foreign film.  Daigo, 30, a cellist in a small classical orchestra that goes broke, becomes an apprentice in \\"encoffinment.\\"  He works with a wise, kind man who performs for families of deceased an elegant, tender, and fascinating ritual with the corpse of their loved one which resembles a tea ceremony.  While Daigo must deal with the attitude of his wife and friends toward what they consider a low caste job, he  experiences deep appreciation from the families of the dead who are healed by the ceremony.  He discovers his true vocation and works through an old hatred.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|David Baldacci's stories grab you from the very beginning. The characters are always interesting and the plot always takes many turns some of which you never expect. This Book was an Amazon Verified Purchase.
B002ONC9NC|5.0|An Education, based on a memoir, is about Jenny, a 16-year-old British schoolgirl who is the target of a sophisticated seduction by David, a 35-year-old man.  Jenny, headed for Oxford, is becoming bored with school, while David is so smooth he takes in her naive parents as well and introduces Jenny to a sophisticated world, including a trip to Paris.  Carey Mulligan as Jenny has an Audrey Hepburn glowing quality that brings delight in her awakening to a wider world. Peter Sarsgaard is perfect in portraying the attractive, charming, intelligent David as well as the rotten scoundrel.  Fortunately, Jenny has the smarts and the grit to actually wrest \\"an education\\" from this experience.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I'm not a big Reacher fan but I have followed several of his adventures. This one however was not as exciting as others that I had read. I did enjoy the read but not quite as much as usual.
B0091REZMW|3.0|a fun game if simple and repetitive. gems aren't necessary but do make the game much easier. recommended if you need a decent time waster.
B0092MKTL2|5.0|It was a fantastic album. There wasn't a song on there I didn't like. Now I have a new awesome band to listen to and new songs to study to.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is so fun and awzom :) &lt;33333333 So I think you guys should really get it. Coin sizer is a cool game.
B004VDL826|5.0|I don't exactly have a lot of time to write a review at the moment, so I'll summarize it with this:  If you're a fan of Ghost in the Shell, or even just cyberpunk, Solid State Society is very relevant to your interests.<br /><br />The only bad thing I could say is it wasn't a 26 episode season like Stand Alone Complex or 2nd Gig.  In the end it made me realize just how badly I want more Ghost in the Shell!
B007V2UGPE|1.0|I hated it<br />u do nothing on it<br />its not fun u do nothing it does it for u I have played better
B0087HT36U|1.0|Tried running the game on my Galaxy Nexus running stock Jelly Bean but force closes right away.  Please fix and I will return for an updated review.
B0099G3I96|4.0|Although not as eclectic, edgy, & high energy as their earlier albums... I'm thoroughly enjoying this more \\"mature\\" laidback sound of No Doubt.<br /><br />It's not always a \\"bad\\" thing when bands/groups stray from their original MO... it HAS been 11 years!!<br /><br />Glad to have them back!
B006HTUZ1C|4.0|This game is fun just to pick up and play. When you het to higher levels, like 18-20 it gets hard as the cubes speed up a lot. However, the game gets repetitive and could use some variation.
B008XG1X18|5.0|So fun to see all the pictures and places.  So many ideas love doing research.  Food looks great too.  Thought facebook fun but like this too.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I saw this movie back in May when it first came out in theaters in 2D. I received the 3D blu ray combo yesterday and watch it during the evening. I own about 25ish 3D movies right now and I think this one is probably the best film in 3D so far. There are so many things that pop out of the screen that you feel like you are battling again Loki too! And the scenes that do not have pop-outs look simply beautiful with nearly no ghosting. I am very sensitive to ghosting and I can notice it right away on a movie if it is present. The Avengers, however, do not fall under the category of such movies. I own Avatar in 3D as well and I still think The Avengers has a better 3D experience (I know, shocking). I hope this helps you when making your 3D blu ray movie purchases!
B0087HT36U|5.0|Good game. Game is similar to Angry Birds but with a twist. I actually like this game more than the others.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minexraft is so fun I want to buy it on every devise. you get to trap zombies and the is all sorts of fun things you should buy it
B000W91RUG|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is a good show, I like to watch it over and over so I bought it on DVD
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This was an amazingly fast paced, fast read!  It kept me guessing until the end.  This was my first Blake Crouch book and I am hooked.  He knows how to build suspense in the first couple of sentences and it doesn't stop until the end.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|As exciting a page turner as any mysterty you have ever read.  Yeah, I knnow, You know how it turns out.  But read it and you'll know what really happened.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|As always, Lee Child ropes you in from the very start and you find it hard to put down until the very end.
B0063GORYU|5.0|i love spider its easy to use the numbers on the cards are easy to read and its a great way to pass some time!
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Does anyone really care anymore?  By the time you've made it through the first two of the trilogy (if you have), book 3 is like trudging through mud to reach the finish line.  All the hype was fun in the beginning, but please, enough is enough.
B007SY3CEW|5.0|I take piano lessons and for full honesty , this will teach u how to play if u practice enough and its rly fun
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Well written. I loved the ending. Just when you think you've got it figured out, you get thrown a curve. Positively worth reading the whole series!
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was a quick read eventhough it is lengthy in pages. I found this story to be interesting but was not thrilled with the ending.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent book! It kept me captivated all the way thru and I couldn't wait to start the next book in the series.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I heard a lot of talk about the book and thought I was going to have a nice, romantic read.  Not so.  It turns my stomach to read this.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I got my pre-teen and teen age granddaughters hooked on the first Downton Abbey.  They were horrified to find Netflix did not supply season 2 on streaming video, so grandmother ordered it for them from Amazon.  Squeals of delight when it arrived.  The entire family enjoyed both series together.  Can't wait for season 3.
B009B50QOU|3.0|Green Day have undertaken the extraordinary task of releasing three albums in very quick succession. This, the first of the trilogy, packs enough of a Punk Rock punch to prove Green Day can still deliver great quality music, but its inconsistency leads to early doubts over whether releasing 37 new songs between now and January is an over-exertion. Of course, it is a brave and innovative endeavour, but then so was Fascism and that didn't turn out to be practical or advisable either.<br /><br />The album sees Billie Joe, Mike and Tré abandon the Rock Opera style of the last two records. As the band has stated, the triple album has enough space to cover the whole of the GD catalogue, genre-wise. ¡Uno! is the nod to the band's roots (with ¡Dos! expected to be more indie, and ¡Tré! being influenced by stadium rock). The direction the band has chosen is not a problem; at its best the LP showcases that GD can still write fast, catchy, aggressive pop-punk. The first four tracks are up there with the band's vintage Dookie-era hits, but the intensity drops off quite drastically as the album continues. It is the consequence of committing so many songs to disc all at once. Lyrics also straddle both the sublime and the ridiculously poor (Fell For You: \\"Woke up in a pool of sweat, first I thought that I'd pissed the bed.\\").<br /><br />If double albums are famously difficult to pull off then a triple album is nye-on impossible to execute well, even for a band of GD's stature and ability. Songs such as `Kill The DJ' consist of very few ideas spread too thinly and some tracks are just old recycled ideas (`Prosthetics Head' called, it wants its riff back please `Troublemaker'). The album's second half is the unremarkable lesser cousin of the first half, but then album filler is almost inevitable on such an ambitious project. However, while `Oh Love' was a truly awful choice as first single, it works surprisingly well as an album closer and is the only real instance of variety onthe album.<br /><br />It's important to note that the other two albums could end up being very strong throughout, which would justify this career decision from Green Day, but at this early stage, it feels like Billie Joe and Co. have surrendered the opportunity of making a strong and consistent double album (which would have been a significant achievement), in favour of originality and singularity. A passable triple album, propped up by b-sides is far less impressive than a world-beating double.<br /><br />Overall: 6/10<br />(If you liked my review please follow my music-based twitter page @2ndHandNoise . Thanks!)
B008XG1X18|4.0|glad its finally available on kindle fire. I absolutely love pinterest. I wish I could put my own pics on but I really enjoy pinning from the web and what my friends pin!!
B008XG1X18|4.0|it maybe my device but it has problems opening up every time but when it does I go pin crazy!
0812992792|1.0|I read up to about 250 pps or so, and I ended up putting this down, I would pick it up again later, and I just could not get into this at all...it just did not keep me interested.....definately could have used a editor....I finally had to move on to something else....<br /><br />Christopher Berry
B007GCY8FS|3.0|This book was a quick read; I have enjoyed all of Lee Child's books; I felt this one lacked some of the story line that the earlier books contained; I will continue to read these books because I like the action but wish the author would re-visit some of the earlier books he wrote and try to recapture that thrill and substance.
B008XG1X18|1.0|As of 9/26/12, this app will not let you log in, even if you try with your Facebook and Twitter accounts. Hopefully, it'll be fixed soon.
B007XGJK4G|5.0|This documentary is fantastic. I would recommend everybody to watch this. Bob Marley was one inspirational man. Watch this right now
B007GCY8FS|5.0|lee Childs continues to amaze. His story lines are as interesting and as fresh as they were in the beginning. Reacher is as fabulous as always.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Best full weather app and it has cool features. Reliable and very convenient. Love it!! Favorite weather app of all time. Great!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I love this book its not a traditionally zombie apocalypse scenario. World war Z makes it much more real. If your a zombie apocalypse enthusiast or an individual prepping for the end of the world. This the book for you!!!
1250006341|5.0|I love looking at this book and learning something new about \\"Downton Abbey\\" from the costumes and production of the show to the time which the show is based on.
B0094KF4WG|5.0|If one didn't know better, you could easily think you were reading a fiction novel. However, the reality brings that thought to an abrupt halt.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Regardless of your feelings as to whether the author broke some sort of military omerta by writing about SEAL training and tactics and regardless of the fact that some details of the author's account of the Bin Laden operation differ from those released by the U.S. government, this will stand as the essential first-hand account of the Bin Laden operation.  The book is written in a driving, narrative style that will compel you to keep turning (or swiping) another page.  There's nothing complex about the language of the book.  It's easy to understand and eschews a lot of technical details that would bog down the pace of the story.  If books like The Warrior Elite, One Bullet Away and Lone Survivor have a permanent place on your bookshelf, this will be a welcome addition to your library.
B00000IM2R|4.0|I love this album, the extra tracks are hip, love plugging in my headphones and dissolving into the sound.  One complaint; the sound quality on side 2 towards the end is a little scratchy, and I believe it's not in the recording, but in the production of the vinyl itself.  Beyond that, Albert King (all 6'4\\" of 'im), the best backing band maybe ever (Booker T., Duck Dunn, Steve Cropper, and Al Jackson,Jr.!!!).  If you are a Stax fan, you almost have to get it. What else can I say?
B0042JIL2E|5.0|So into the sounds of both Imelda May and the instuments in this CD. A very good variety of both.  Looking forward to more from Imelda May.  She just made a new fan.
B008I3QZKU|1.0|Save your money and just buy Be Still for $0.99. It's the only decent song on the album. Unless an entire album of their soft fairy-land melodies is your thing, then buy away.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game! Also, if you running low on coins and it's late at night, go to sleep and wake up with so many coins.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|As expected, Lee Child strikes diamonds again with \\"A Wanted Man.\\" Jack Reacher's undershirt has an \\"S\\" on the front. What a great hero he is! Lee Child's novels might start off tamely, but the suspense, the twists and the climax sneak up on the reader. I could barely put the book away.
B008KYDUYG|5.0|First, I just want to let the North American customers know that this is currently a Best Buy exclusive. Buy it there for the retail price ($39.99) and not the outrageous imported price listed here at this time.<br />This box set collects all of the studio albums up until 2009's 21st Century Breakdown. Basically, if you're behind and want to get caught up with the new stuff this is a great place to start. 9 albums (good ones at that) for $40 is a steal. The CDs do NOT include anything extra. No booklets, bonus tracks, extra artwork etc. This is simply a clamshell box that's the exact size of a CD. In it are 9 CDs housed in individual sleeves. The front and back cover artwork for each CD is the same as the original but as said before, no booklets are included. If you own all of these albums the only real reason to pick this up is to have the nice box and some knock around copies. Other than that that, what you see is what you get. Those looking to get into Green Day should most definitely start here as it includes pretty much everything they've ever done with the exception of the B-Sides and rarities album, \\"Shenanigans.\\" Again all 9 studio releases for $40 is a steal. And if you like even just a few of these albums, definitely grab their latest release, \\"!UNO!\\"
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I've read all of the Reacher novels, and this one is the best yet.  I love the way Lee Child can paint a picture that draws you into the story and keeps you in suspense chapter after chapter.  Nothing is ever as it seems, but somehow it all fits together in the end.  My biggest complaint is that I finished it too soon.
B003QP4NPE|4.0|I enjoyed the book quite a bit. I got hooked very early and about midway through it I did not want it to end. I sort of wished that the book would have taken a little more time explaining how the hi-tech equipment was developed in a little more detailed way. I was not looking for real specific plans. For example I wanted to hear a little bit more about where the plans came from and how the plans were triggered to be sent out and how the vendors were selected.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|After my dog chewed off the business end of my original Kindle power cord, I went to Amazon to order a replacement. Tempted by a private seller offering a used cord for a third the price of a new one, I ordered it. But the shipment never arrived. The seller, honorably, returned payment. Instead of going this riskier route again, I ordered a new one at full price. It arrived within two days and is performing its job as expected.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|The only bad thing about a new Lee Child book about Jack Reacher is that it ends and I have to wait almost another year for the next one.  Child has a leading character that just keeps getting better.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I really liked this app until I noticed all the puzzles I paid $1.00 each for ~ about $30.00 worth or more...disappeared.  I do not remember reading anywhere that you would lose puzzles that you purchased if there was an update.  I never even got to do most of them. If you get this app..do not buy any puzzles.  Use only the free ones.  I will be addressing this one with. the company.  That is too much $$$ to lose.  ANGRY AND UPSET!!!!!!!!!!
0385344333|1.0|I am amazed that Reacher Creature's review pretty much summaries the way I feel about the latest Reacher-book, though he expressed it better. I have read all the Jack Reacher novels and enjoyed them immensely, (except occasionally I had to suspend my moral sensibilities). The last two however, have been quite different. I found them boring and not anywhere of the same standard as the previous lot. Again Reacher Creature's review is spot on.<br /><br />The author appears to have run out of inspiration like many hit TV programs that then become pale imitations of their former glory and are then cancelled. For Reacher fans I hope there is one last book that gets back to the standard of the previous books (bar the last two) so that we fans can then not remain unfulfilled.<br /><br />RobNel
0525953728|5.0|Just amazing. I couldn't put this book down. Excellent story telling and written very well. It sets the record straight.
B004H4XI5O|4.0|Sometimes, a book title tells you literally nothing about the book. Such is the case for Moonwalking with Einstein. Its title gradually makes more sense, but serves a good indicator for the zany quality of the book.<br /><br />This is my kind of non-fiction: witty, clever writing; an excellent ability to make even mundane scenes interesting; and a perfect balance between self-deprecation and self-praise. I can definitely see this as a re-read later on.
B000LTAY1U|3.0|In brief, it's not a bad little watch. I actually like the canvas band, which I wasn't sure if I would. The face is a little smaller than what I would have liked, but for the price it's a pretty good watch. I'm not sure how much better quality you could get at this price point. I'm just a little stingy with the stars because I was spoiled from my citizen which I gave away, but cost me 4x what this watch cost me. If you're like me and like to give your watches away to somewhat undeserving people then consider this watch because at least you won't be giving away perfectly good watches that you paid a lot of money for lol
B00932H1HG|4.0|I first listened to CH on myanimalhome.net when they had it streaming with video. I was initially very unimpressed. It seemed lack-luster and lazy, like they thought \\"Hey! you know all that amazing talent we've developed for years? Let's just throw that out the window.\\" But after I bought it, I gave it some more time. The song Applesauce was recommended to me, and I have to say its the best song on the album. I found that their sound had developed rather than fallen back. It's honestly a very strong album that I think is very representative of what they really want their sound to be. I can see this album being less than appealing to new-comers to AnCo's sound. But if you've been a fan before, I think there is something you can love about this record.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Two words can say it all, but I have to have at least twenty for this review to post. Ah, there we go. Absolutely spectacular!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Ads between games aren't bothersome and game runs smoothly everytime. Haven't had an issue yet with anything so hopefully won't.
B005HSL626|5.0|I LOVE FRUIT NINGA I THINK IT IS A FUN KID FRIENDLY GAME THAT IS VERY TIME CONSUMING. THERE IS NO BETTER WAY TO USE YOUR TIME
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Living in Virginia Beach and knowing a few navy seals, I now have even more Respect for these guys. Mark Owens account of what really happend on that historic day not only opens your eyes to the dangers our guys face day in and day out but the training alone to prepare for their missions is remarkable.I am and have always been very patriotic. This book makes me even more proud to be an American and to know these men would give their life for me to do what I do every day.Great book.
B001KQIKUK|5.0|Hot Damn! At least some boys still know how to play rock and roll any more. This album is fantastic, especially if you like hard jamming, weird, sometimes irreverent rock and roll.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. This guy Nick had me liking him, hating him, wishing he were dead. Amy, well you just have to read the book to judge for yourself how you feel about her.Great read with lots of twists and turns.I gave this book 5 stars only because you did feel every emotion associated with a good book.Looking forward to the next read Dark Places by Gillian Flynn.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I got this book on my Kindle.  I thoroughly enjoyed this story through the eyes of a dog.  Being a dog owner myself, I didn't think I could love my dog more, but after reading this I look at her differently.  I know it's fabricated, but it gives an idea of how sensitive a dog can be.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|Simon Pegg can do no wrong.  He expertly blended dry British humor with the brasher, slapstick-level American comedy in Paul, complete with dick jokes, people wetting themselves and the mocking of bible thumpers.  The extended version is worth it just to see Jason Bateman say \\"Check that\\" when speaking to what's her name's father.  His deadpan humor, while playing the same character in everything he's in, is spot on every time I see it.  I can't help it; I love Jason Bateman and his execution just doesn't get old for me.  As much I loved the pure British wit of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz Pegg got it right in Paul, playing to audiences on both sides of the pond.  I laugh my butt off every time I watch this movie.  I've lost count of how many times I've seen it, honestly.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great App! I love pinterest for the Kindle! It is easy to keep up with your pins when you are away from your computer.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Before it kind of went off into WTF? land True Blood ran itself close to the first book and was a truly engaging, TV show with a plan.  Sure there were subplots and weird things exploding all over Bon Temps but it wasn't as insane at the fifth season.  Season One solidified my dislike for the schizophrenic Sookie Stackhouse, loathe the way Bill pronounces Sookie's name, fangirl Eric and his total epicness, get a girl crush on Pam and envy Lafayette's style.  Jason, has dumb as that boy is it's not a grating stupidity.  He's wholly endearing is his moronism and you can't help but like him.  There are so many more that are thoroughly intriguing that would have me rambling forever on their awesomeness.  This was the beginning and it certainly hasn't ended for me yet.
B0083GQKQG|1.0|This was a very strange and dark movie and I was not a fan. It simply was not enjoyable to watch.
B003L77GGK|4.0|Season 6 is the first Supernatural season with Kripke gone and I have to say I felt it.  There was something missing, especially in the first few episodes.  I couldn't help but notice it, like a baby deer trying to find it's footing on these new googly legs it has.  Something wasn't right and it had nothing to do with the status of Sam's soul.  As the season progressed that deer grew up a little bit and it's knees weren't so crazy to stand on but something was still kind of off about it.  It couldn't be helped.  The only way to bring that back is to bring back Kripke.  I don't see that happening; not in the same capacity anyway.  Don't get me wrong; there were definitely some episodes that had my laughing my butt off but it was a little off, like pudding that may be toeing the line of still being good.  It still tastes like pudding but it leaves an aftertaste that a little bit wrong.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I spend my days at the beach listening to the wind chimes hanging on the porch of the beach house behind me... Then a student comes in for their appointment and we stick our toes in the sand and enjoy the afternoon.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Wonderfully written. Brings my respect level even higher for these men and women.  I still cannot believe Obama gets the credit for this when he did nothing.  A must read for the reality of our world.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book keeps you thinking all the time.  When you think you have it figured out, it changes again.  The least boring book I've read in a very long time.
B003F5NSTW|5.0|Riveting read. Poses more questions than it answers. Unexpected twist at the end that took my breath away and left me feeling so sad.
B00267N3DQ|5.0|My 4 year old grand daughter was captivated by the story. Disney did a great job of transferring the film to blu-ray.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Well to say the least, I'm not impressed.  I don't know what all of the hoopla was all about.  Everyone going on about you have to read it.  But then I'm only about 30% of the way into it.  So far, it's about a domineering man, who has a sick twisted since of what sex should be, and a woman who doesn't think highly enough of herself.  But then I have never been into the Romance type novels, give me a good mystery any day.

B008NW67E0|5.0|Wow.  I downloaded this off of Amazon this morning, and have been totally pumped all day.  I am fired up to work out to this tomorrow morning, it's all queued up in the iPod.<br /><br />I've listed to \\"Babel\\" through about 3 times already, and appreciate it more with each listen.  It is stacked chock-a-block with harmonies, a shredding banjo, interesting lyrics, and Mumford soul.<br /><br />Personally, I find the album in its whole even more engaging and consistent than Sigh No More -- no mean feat.  Each song makes me want to sing out and conquer the world.  I felt so human and alive walking under a beautiful clear fall blue sky today, with Lover of the Light turned up to 11 on my headphones!<br /><br />To have spent so much time between albums, and to face the sophomore pressure after their first smash, and to answer it all with this tremendous second studio effort has cemented Mumford and Sons as a musical force here to stay.  I am looking forward to listening to this one much more in the future, and their future efforts!  Go Mumford and Sons!
B00006674X|5.0|This movie deals with racism, religon, poverty and abortion. Elvis and Sally Fields are great together! There is not a lot of cheese like most Elvis movies have.
B007KDFWRG|5.0|Great live CD.  The band sounds excellent, Susan's voice is incredible as usual, as is Derek's guitar.  Can't recommend enough.
B0076OUXBE|4.0|I really enjoyed this book full of information of Michael's later years.  There are so many books about his young and middle years, but very little of the last few years.  It is obviously well researched to get to the truth, and that truth is written about very well - interesting information well set out, and not a trace of scandal which is sooooo refreshing<br />Can highly recommend this book to all Michael fans, and to those who are not yet but are searching for the true man in HiStory.
B000669GAI|4.0|I love Pearl Jam. Nothing more to say about the band.<br /><br />I was comparing the remix by O'Brien versus what was released on \\"Ten\\", and all I can ask is, \\"what was he thinking?\\".<br /><br />I can see where he was going. It seems he brought the guitars/instruments to the forefront, but it really took away from the main melody of the tracks he remixed.<br /><br />I get it; he's a pro, I'm not. He makes hundreds of thousands doing what he does. But seriously? I prefer the released \\"Ten\\" tracks.<br /><br />The stereo mix is confusing. The melody is buried. The nuances that existed in \\"Ten\\" now sound like mistakes. I'm glad he didn't remix the other tracks.
B00005JNQA|4.0|The Interpreter(released Apr/05)stars Nicole Kidman as the titled interpreter Silvia Broome,Sean Penn as secret service agent Tobin Kellar,along with a nice supporting cast.The film pulls you in from the start and Pollack is on game,revealing plot elements like pieces in a puzzle;with a very pleasing but different end result.<br />The film opens in Matobo,a fictional African country,full of strife and internal violence,run by its dictator Edmond Zuwanie(Earl Cameron).Three people drive up to an old stadium,in disrepair, for a rendezvous;one is a black interpreter,one is Kidman's brother Simon and one is a friend of Simon and Kidman's,Phillippe,a photgrapher,who arranged the meeting.Phillippe stays behind in the vehicle as the other two enter the stadium.They find three young boys playing soccer and one of them leads the two men under the stadium to view several dead bodies,from a recent massacre.After a few moments the boy yells to the men that someone is coming.As they rush out they are confronted with the boys who now are armed.The two men are shot dead.Phillippe hears the shots,as one of Zuwanie's men drive up.Phillippe hides,then flees the country.<br />Back in the States we start to follow the life of interpreter Kidman,who works at the UN.One day an evacuation is called in the building,and all personnel leave.Kidman,who forgot her satchel,returns to her office to retrieve it and hears some chatter on her headphones.It is a conversation about the killing of the teacher(Zuwanie),who is coming to speak at the UN.As she listens the lights in her room come on and she frantically switches them off,but the voices appear to know she is there and she flees.The next day she reports what she heard and secret service man Penn and company show up.In short time he/they doubt her story and she goes through a battery of testing and interrogation.They cannot shake her story,as she is adamant about what she heard and its intent.We learn Kidman is originally from Motabo and her sister and parents were killed there,years before.She took up arms briefly with her brother,but left after killing a young boy,who was about to kill her.<br />As the film progresses,Kidman is being followed and fears for her life.In fact an intruder enters her apartment,taking a mask,then appearing on the outside fire escape and running off.That man leaves behind a trace of hair and a Motaboan killer,the same one seen outside the stadium where her brother got killed,appears and snuffs out his underling for his sloppiness.Kidman knows of a  rival of Zuwanies in New York,Kuman-Kuman(George Harris).She meets him on a bus,accusing him of much of the violence in her home country.He denies the charges and says he will see what he can find out about her brother.In the meantime,the Motabaon killer has come on board with a satchel in hand,along with one secret service agent following Kidman and another following the killer.It's a cozy set up until Penn asks his men via radio ear buds,whether the man is carrying anything.Penn and his associates have found the killers victim and some explosives.When the killer gets off it first appears that he has taken everything with him.Penn tells his men to get off,Kidman and one agent do,as a woman finds what she says is a lunch bag the killer left behind.In seconds the bus blows up,killing many aboard,including the agent and Kuman-Kuman and his entourage,along with others on the street.<br />The day of Zuwanies speech comes and Kidman is taking a shower,at least that is what Penn thinks;as he and his colleagues have been sitting across the street monitoring her room and activities.However she leaves the shower water running and escapes out the bathroom window.She goes to the UN and waits in a safe room,the place in which she figures Zuwanie will be taken to,if anything should happen.The scene switches to the UN where all precautions have been taken inside and out,as Penn suspects this is going to be a suicide bomber,and the bomb,he thinks,is already in the UN.As Zuwanie stands before the UN giving his speech a hitman has entered the sound control booth and he is putting together a rifle.Penns hunch was wrong but when he spies a hole cut in the booth glass,pieces of the puzzle come together in his head and in short order, is quickly climbing the stairs.I won`t reveal the ending as such,but it brings together alot of the puzzle that Pollock has laid out before us through the films progression.The ending is bittersweet also,but a fitting one.<br />Pollock himself appears a few times in this film as Penn`s boss and did a great job(not the first time he`s appeared in films,either his own or someone elses).After that shooting takes place in the opening scenes Pollock has our attention straight away.From then on we switch to the States and the puzzle and its pieces are laid out bit by bit, building on one another.Pollock weaves a compelling tale and the climax is quite the culmination of layers of many elements.Smart,well presented and edited,this is definitely one of my favourite Pollock films.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include deleted scenes,an alternate ending,three featurettes and a short on Pollock discussing widescreen vs Pan and Scan.The latter I watched and it should be mandatory viewing for all movie goers and watchers,especially the home bound crowd.It also should be mandatory viewing for ANYONE involved in the distribution of movies,in any capacity.<br />All in all an excellent and engrossing tale about African corruption and violence,coming to US soil and its ultimate consequences.Pollock,along with his two main stars do a bang up job throughout.4-4 1/2

0307949508|3.0|The Girl Who Played With Fire, the second in Stieg Larsson's Millenium trilogy, is an undoubtedly compelling and intriguing read, but it is not without some serious flaws. Most of the latter follow from some odd choices the author made about how to structure this volume, and his pen in general. I've found Larsson's writing style to be a bit pedantic, but in ways that while initially hard to swallow, were easy to either overlook or get used to. His descriptions of models of computers (complete with how much RAM the thing is loaded with), software, brands, the city of Stockholm, and extensive supporting casts certainly help to flesh out his world, but also raise the word count prodigiously. It grew particularly grating in this novel, where there were literally pages full of nothing but descriptions of what Lisbeth was eating, what furniture or food she had bought, and other minutiae. While they perhaps serves to further establish the protagonist's isolation, it became excessive.<br /><br />Furthermore, what was really unexpected, and a bit infuriating, is that he takes the most compelling character in the story (Lisbeth), who is holding ENORMOUS amounts of information relevant to the reader, and removes her from the story completely for the entire middle heft of the novel. The POV in the first book was relegated to her and Blomkvist (with other small asides here and there); we are used to hearing her thoughts, and we do exclusively for much of the early narrative here. Removing her allows him to turn the middle of the book into a police procedural which, while impressively plotted for most of its length, introduces a dozen characters that have little to no relevance to the deeper story, and apart from some playful descriptions of them (Officer \\"Bubble\\" Bublanski springs to mind), they remain mostly textureless and feel impossible to care about. Additionally, once Lisbeth does reenter the narrative, she still spends a good deal of time shielding her thoughts from the reader. After hearing her talk about \\"All the evil\\", using that extremely uncharacteristic phrase for the tenth time, I was about ready to throw the book across the room. It just felt manipulative, a ploy to create additional tension when there was already plenty present in the mostly riveting storyline.<br /><br />The feminist themes are a bit refreshing however, and the real concern the author seems to have for those issues (violence against women, exploitation of women, etc) as well as the stereotype shattering female lead he provides will keep most readers hooked. While she may be intriguing, Lisbeth begins to move rather away from being likeable in this volume. Between spying on those who are attempting to help her, treating the few friends she has somewhere between poorly and terribly, and the sharp flashes of sadism and violence she is capable of and displays frequently, her unfortunate childhood and the abysmal treatment she received during it (as well as the promise of justice for it) seems to be one of the only things keeping the reader rooting for her. The other half of the first book's duo, Blomkvist, takes a mostly backseat to other characters but is still able to flex his impressive journalistic muscles and play a key role.<br /><br />Complaints aside, the book is still well paced once it gets its hooks in (though it takes a bit to get there) and is quite an enjoyable read. It's hard to imagine anyone finishing The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and not wanting to see the story through. While its 700+ pages may seem daunting, and drag in places, they fly by for the most part. And the second skid-to-a-complete-and-abrupt-stop ending promises that the third volume will be underhand almost immediately.eader.

B004QKNXIQ|3.0|But, I can't stand when people try to make themselves critics.. We all have our opinions, and even though I would recommend this movie to anyone I have to give it three stars because the sound quality when I rented it was AWFUL. We had to sit a foot away just to hear it, so annoying. Wish they could fix it before it expires!
B00846REIS|3.0|It was lackluster compared to others like it. I did like the book but I feel like it needed more of something.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is a must read for grade school children.  I teach fifth grade and can't wait to begin this story as a read aloud.  We work so hard to make our students great people, and this book is a stand out example of how very ordinary kids can become extraordinary.  While it is true that the main character is amazing, he brings many other students up to greatness.  My students will walk away better people after sharing this inspiring story.<br /><br />So, I started reading this book as a read aloud this week with my fifth graders.  I wasn't sure how they'd react, but they can't get enough!  Whenever we have down time they beg me to read more.  We have laughed, we have cried, and the discussion that follow each reading are rich and thought-provoking.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|More than the first 350 pages out of 400 are all about riding the roads of Nebraska and Iowa, some suspense but very little action.  Nowhere does Reacher kick ass like in all the previous books.  He shoots a lot of people but that is it.  The most action he gets into infers a fight, not part of the story, where he gets a broken nose.  That is unusual for Reacher to be harmed in any way and we are left to imagine what happened to the other guy, or more likely 3 or more other guys as it usually takes several of them to make a fight where they have a chance to do him any damage.  Still, I enjoyed it somewhat and will look forward to the next book with hope that it will be better.  Maybe Reacher will also get some love-life when he gets to Virginia--seems like we have been looking forward to Virginia for several episodes!<br /><br />Steve

B008RV5K4U|3.0|I agree with one of the other reviewers that the internal monologue Batman offers througout the original graphic novel is crucial to establishing the mood of the story and choosing not to use it was a mistake.<br /><br />While I think using a lot of the panels from the original works fantastically why they didn't just use it as a complete storyboard is beyond me.  In the book you never see Commissioner Gordon's right hand man, Merkel-- and here he's just a regular generic policeman.  In the book Batman isn't sure it's really Harvey committing the new Two Face Crimes while in this there's no question.<br /><br />More of a mistake was the screenwriter's decision to re-write Frank Miller's dialogue-- WHY?  Why adapt a work rightfully admired by so many and then change crucial dialogue exchanges?  The amazing interplay in the first scene between Gordon and Bruce Wayne becomes a chance to summarize all of what's wrong with Gotham-- we already get it-- Gotham's a hell hole and Batman is retired, Miller handled this scene so much more effectively.<br /><br />Even the opening scene, which in the book is hard to understand just what is going on but is explained when you get to the end of the sequence was brilliant.  Here it's dumbed down and spoon fed to us as if they were concerned that the audience would be confused for even a half second.<br /><br />They made an admirable attempt at capturing the art of Frank Miller-- and for the most part it works, but I wish they had used black instead of the constant gray on the characters which makes it look like Anime (not an insult to those people who like it) but this would have been so much better if there were heavy blacks like we saw in the 60s with the classic JONNY QUEST.<br /><br />The Voice actors are solid-- but there's still an element of people holding back--which can happen when you record each session separately in front of a microphone and don't have other actors to react to.  Peter Weller is in fine form as Batman, but sometimes it just feels flat.<br /><br />The actor playing Commissioner Gordon verges on cartoony delivery which is often distracting.  Gordon should have been a commanding presence in this, instead he's a little goofy at times.<br /><br />Overall, while I'm glad they did the adaption, and kudos for making it two parts instead of trying to jam this epic story into 85 mins, why the changes WB?  Miller's script was perfect as it was.<br /><br />The average modern Batman fan whose never read the series will likely find this an exciting well done bit of animation, but to the die-hard Dark Knight fans (and yes Daniel, this came first long before the Christopher Nolan films) I think you'll be slightly let down as to what might have been.t sometimes it just feels flat.<br /><br />The actor playing Commissioner Gordon verges on cartoony delivery which is often distracting.

1476712042|5.0|Hmmm, I don't know where to begin with this one. I read this book in August, but I didn't put my review right away. I read different POV about this one and I wanted to write everything that came up in my mind before doing my post.<br /><br />I didn't know about this author: Jamie McGuire. Her novel Beautiful Disaster didn't catch my attention when I was on Goodreads or on other books blog. I have to admit that I was aware of this book since the first cover was kind of... unique? And a bit disturbing! But I'm a freak/fan of Paranormal Romance and Ms. McGuire book wasn't on top of my TBR pile. I was ''in'' for some change thought, so I eagerly tried Beautiful Disaster. I saw and read some reviews about this book that are totally contradictory, but as I seen on other blogs: bad or good reviews you should give it a try, this might be the book of the year for you too!<br /><br />This is a contemporary romance, but also one of the best book I read (all genre included) in my whole life. This one got a specific place on my favorite bookshelf. This story was a huge ''turn on'' and it started hard and fast and the action didn't stop until the very end.<br /><br />One name: Travis<br /><br />OMG, some girls over there might think I'm crazy, but this guy is (almost) a dream comes true. Yes, well the guy has some flaws like everyone else, and it might sound clich&eacute; but he was the beginning, the middle and the end of this story. Without him, the book would have been a plain romance like many other.<br /><br />He's impatient, jealous, had a tendency to alcohols, won't back down from what he seeks or wants even if it mean to hurt people he cares about, he's easily angry and he smoke. But he's also sexy, have tattoos, he's able to protect his girlfriend since he's a fighter and seems to be the perfect boyfriend when everything is fine between him and Abby.<br /><br />Abby was at first, a cute, intelligent and great character, I liked her personality and her guts. The way she's standing out of the crowd was great. But I have to admit that she sometime felt on my nerves because she doesn't seem to know what she wants or what's good for her.<br /><br />Jamie McGuire had a funny way to join are characters; with a bet:<br /><br />-if he loses the fight, he won't have sex for a whole month<br />-if she loses, she'll be staying at Travis's place for the whole month<br /><br />Guess who won?<br /><br />Even their friends were an awesome couple! Mare is the kind of girlfriend everybody likes and Shep is so cute! These two couples will lead the reader into funny adventures, going through great and rough emotions, parties, awful situations and turning upside down your world!<br /><br />The story was a page turner, my favorite candy (candy floss), the most tasteful cupcakes; it brought me fireworks in my belly and filled my mind with beautiful scenes. I almost cried at the end because it was over! (And the end... swoon!)  I couldn't put it down, I had to read it: at night, between shift at my job, I wish I had it on audiobook to be able to heard it in my car!<br /><br />This book/Travis/Jamie McGuire has brightened my day, week, month.

We checked our 3D player with other movies with no problems so it's not our player.  This 3D disc keeps freezing up and its quite the fight to get it going again.  We had to just pass over some scenes to be able to watch the rest of the movie.  So disappointing.  We haven't yet looked at the remaining discs because it was such a hassle.  Did we just get a bad set or are others having this same problem?

B008O69SZ0|5.0|At 73 Ian Hunter continues to write, record and sing songs better than many people half his age. Hunter has been producing albums since 1969 (his first with his band [[ASIN:B0000AJ5T7 Mott The Hoople]]). The band arguably peaked with [[ASIN:B0000AJ5TA Braincapers]], [[ASIN:B000E6EJA2 Mott]] and the David Bowie produced [[ASIN:B000E6EJAC All the Young Dudes]] (and some would argue [[ASIN:B000EOUSJU Hoople]] as well)but Hunter continued to periodically produce stunning albums throughout his long solo career from [[ASIN:B00080CO9W Ian Hunter]]to [[ASIN:B0026J8LBS You're Never Alone with A Schizophrenic (30th Anniversary Edition)]]as well as the latest trilogy of albums he has put out in the last decade.<br /><br />\\"When I'm President\\" continues to show that Hunter remains a vital, interesting talent with something to say. Although Hunter stumbled for a little while after the death of frequent collaborator and friend Mick Ronson, he found his footing again in the 90's. \\"When I'm President\\" arguably holds its own with [[ASIN:B000068G2Q Rant]] whether it be in terms of sensitive ballardry or take-no-prisoners hard rockers.<br /><br />The only issue I have with his latest albums is that a bit too much compression was added during the mastering process and while that doesn't make it impossible to listen to (it's not as bad as some out there), the music would have benefited from a better, more dynamic and sensitive mastering. This type of mastering has been the trend over a decade going from bad to worse and improving recently with some terrific reissues ([[ASIN:B0075LTOR2 The Complete Studio Recordings 1972 - 1982]] a marvelous,dynamic and rich sounding mastering that captures the warmth of the orignal analog recordings). I'd like to see Hunter follow suit and, if he has any further recordings up his sleeve, return to a presentation that sounds as great as his earlier albums did on CD and vinyl.<br /><br />That said, this is still an essential album for Hunter fans. My only other complaint is that Ian isn't touring much on the West Coast of the U.S. (he lives here)and I'm hoping that he'll add some dates eventually for those of us out here as well.<br /><br />For fans looking for Ian's first three albums there's a nice boxed set with bonus tracks [[ASIN:B007IO8TT0 Original Album Classics]]. The first CD in the set features the remasters of his first and third album while the second is an earlier 1998 remaster omitting the bonus tracks (which is kind of curious but, perhaps, it had to do with a cost issue). Nevertheless, it's a great way to get these albums some of which can be a bit difficult to find and compliment this terrific album well.<br /><br />Highly recommended.other complaint is that Ian isn't touring much on the West Coast of the U.S. (he lives here)and I'm hoping that he'll add some dates eventually for those of us out here as well.<br /><br />For fans looking for Ian's first three albums there's a nice boxed set with bonus tracks [[ASIN:B007IO8TT0 Original Album Classics]].

B0083SBJXS|5.0|It has all been said and I agree wholeheartedly. This is one of THE great action films and is probably the best comic book movie, up to now, ever made.<br /><br />Now, for those who have not had the pleasure, add to all that a wonderful commentary on the process by Director Joss Whedon.  Buffy and Firefly fans already know that his commentaries are always interesting, informative, and just plain funny as hell! Enjoy.

The sound is crisp, fresh, and new. It is still relevant today. This album is definitely a must have in the collection of early Metal enthusiasts. If you don't have it, get it! You will not be disappointed.

B008RV5K5E|2.0|Let me start by saying that I love, love, love \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" comic. I have read it once a year since it originally came out, probably. It's an awesome piece of comic art and I have been waiting to see the animation ever since I first heard it was coming out.<br /><br />That being said, I find myself hugely disappointed. One of the best things about the comic is the way Miller puts you in the heads of the chief characters. The narrative is as much internal as it is external. You get to know Batman in a way you don't often see him, from the inside.<br /><br />Obviously, the director/writers didn't think the narration worked. They try to externalize all the narrative and because of this you lose the sense of the inner motivations of Batman. Worse, since so much of the narrative of the story is internal, the writers have had to write in material that doesn't exist in the comic in order to explain to the viewers what's going on. Some of it is cringe inducing.<br /><br />The writers obviously didn't want to take too much liberty with the dialogue so they resort to trying to tell the story visually in between all the dialogue. The result is a slow, plodding pace. It's so plodding that I found myself bored with the whole thing.<br /><br />They also took some of the edginess off of Batman. In the graphic novel, Batman is mean-spirited, crotchety and sadistic. Some of the lines that really bring this out were cut so you get a watered-down, \\"safe\\" Dark Knight. You can almost hear the discussions being had around some conference table somewhere about the need to keep Batman \\"safe\\" for kids. Somebody somewhere chickened out and decided that it wouldn't change the story if Batman were just a little nicer.<br /><br />For the record, I was 12 or 13 when I first read the comic and I ate it up, sadistic Batman and all.<br /><br />I liked the casting of Peter Weller as Batman. After watching \\"Robocop\\", I actually thought he would've made a good live-action \\"Dark Knight\\" back in the day. He has the jaw for it. I do wish the voice acting had been a little more emotive. It felt kind of flat.<br /><br />Lastly, the music was pretty standard fare, dull and unobtrusive. It doesn't add anything.<br /><br />All-in-all, it's a pretty soul-less affair. You get the feeling that the director tried to \\"make it my own\\" and, in the end, he did so, much to my chagrin. He removed the art and the heart. As excited as I was for Part 1 to come out, I no longer look forward to Part 2.

B008QE9VJI|1.0|As a die-hard fan of the original '60s version of \\"Dark Shadows\\" and the 1991 NBC version of the series, I waited anxiously ever since this movie was first announced in 2007.  What Burton and Depp created five years later was comedic trash.  They could've produced a gothic-horror classic, instead they went for the juvenile comedy route instead.  EPIC FAIL.

B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I won't review the movie as rotten tomatoes and imdb do a good job at that. Sound and video quality were very good.
B009B51K9U|1.0|The 1-star rating refers to the unlabeled censored version of ¡UNO! The first paragraph below explains the reason for this bad review, and the UPDATE that follows provides a review of the music on the [Explicit] version.<br /><br />Word to the wise: If you want the original recording, you need to find the one labeled \\"[explicit].\\" The one listed here, and shown as the default option when you shop for Uno via Amazon's mp3 store, is the CRAPPY CENSORED VERSION!!! Nowhere does it indicate this. FAIL ... fortunately a quick chat session yielded a $5 refund for the unlabeled censored P.O.S. album. Yay Amazon for making it right!<br /><br />**UPDATE 9/28/12: It turns out Amazon doesn't allow more than one review per user per \\"product set.\\" That's really unfortunate because the original album is a different work from the censored version. The censored version gets 1 star. BUT the original version (labeled [EXPLICIT]) gets 3 stars.<br />This album sounds like Green Day lite -- i.e., the band is systematically applying the GD sound to some formulaic pop-hit compositions, and the result is a very listenable album that just might generate a lot of Top 40 radio play, but it will disappoint many die-hard GD fans (like me) because it sounds like a sellout. Billie Joe's voice lacks the passion and grit we expect. It seems like he's not into this record at all, and that makes it difficult to get too excited about it. And on tracks like \\"Kill the DJ\\" we hear GD trying to be their old cynical selves, and instead they just sound like a bunch of overpaid aging hipsters. It's kind of sad and strikes an ugly note on an otherwise fairly decent album.<br />Having said all that ... We haven't yet heard acts 2 and 3 of this trilogy, and I remain hopeful that taken in its proper context ¡UNO! will sound like a nod to simplicity and fun, before a more complex middle and perhaps a profound ending. Asking too much? Maybe. But knowing GD, this album has the earmarks of a calm before the storm.I guess we'll know soon enough. Until then ¡UNO! is an enjoyable disappointment -- and that would be the title of my review of the original [Explicit] version if Amazon would allow me to review that album separately.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|If you have read the other Reacher books then you know what to expect from this one, and it delivers it. The tense car scenes are well done. The ending is a bit less suspenseful compared to the middle, but the mood and action aren't bad. It's well worth reading. I guess I can see why people feel the author ran out of gas towards the end, but Lee Child on a quarter tank beats most other authors by a mile.
B002TXZRRM|5.0|Unusual outlook on life for a European reader. Gives a good impression of life in an African country we don't hear much about in Scandinavia. Good sense of humour, some unexpected twists in the plot. Look forward to reading more from the series.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|it really is the book that leaves you wanting more but with some closer to the story you are always left wanting to know how life went on afterwards but you know its an end you can guess every one had long happy lives All of the books in this set have a way of pulling you into the store
B00338QENI|4.0|When I began reading this book I immediately turned to my biologist boyfriend and said, \\"I'm reading about Henrietta Lacks!\\" \\"Who?\\" he responded. \\"The woman who they took cells from, the HeLa cells.\\" \\"I thought her name was Helen Lane,\\" he said. Thus began an interesting look into the life of a woman who was misnamed and unknown to even though who, to quote my scientist boyfriend, \\"killed millions and millions of her cells in the process of doing research.\\"<br /><br />This novel gives the reader both the scientific background of the HeLa cells and the personal story of Henrietta Lacks and her family. It presents both sides fairly and while some parts may seem appalling, the reader must remember that this is how things were done in the 50s and we cannot impose today's standards on practices from over 60 years ago.<br /><br />Clearly the worlds of science and medicine are much better off having found the HeLa cells - many important discoveries and advances were made possible due to HeLa. The question, however, is whether or not the Lacks family is better off knowing their mother's cells were used.<br /><br />Initially I was disappointed with the end for the story just sort of stops, with a chapter that follows explaining where each family member is now. Then I realized that this is only way the book could end for Henrietta's story has been told and each family members' story has been told. And that, was the point of the book.

Is it literary high art that will be analyzed in English classes for years? NO.  Is it a hell of a good/quick read that roped me in, reminded me of my childhood and made me think of my future?  Hell yes.  Read it if you ever remember playing a stand up video game for 25 cents.  Trust me. I  am from the Ko-Dan Armada.
B007704PRU|3.0|A clever author avoids a love triangle, but a good one gives us what we want. And why not, I say? A carefully crafted love triangle can have us cheering the whole game, set, match. Though we're always going to feel a pang of sorrow for the underdog.<br />Particularly when there is no clear underdog.<br /><br />Alex obviously has the upper advantage, being the first love who haunts her thoughts from a distance. Julian is the uptown, circumstantial guy, who, as much as I tried to resist, somehow wriggled his poor-little-rich-boy way into my heart. A girl giving a boy a life defining awakening? What modern reader doesn't yearn for that?<br /><br />Oliver has mastered that inexperience and awkwardness factor so vividly that desire practically cold-sweats itself off the font.<br /><br />I could take or leave (but preferably leave) the \\"then\\" parallel story line. I think I would have been more interested if it wasn't competing with the<br />\\"now\\". But spliced up, as it was, it just became an irritating interruption to the kidnap, and of course, to the addictive Julian/Lena dynamic. It got in the way like a tall person at a concert.<br /><br />I have to admit that I've become a bit desensitized to the cold-poverty-hunger element to dys-lit. It doesn't have that effect anymore of making me writhe in horror as they freeze. I no longer feel grateful for what I've got when they scavenge old clothes. Nor do I feel a genuine sense of satisfaction when they share a morsel of rabbit meat.<br /><br />However, when they shower for the first time in weeks, after being unwashed and cooped up in stuffy conditions, yes, that still feels eminently gooood.<br /><br />And that ending, wow. We all saw it coming, but Oliver somehow managed to lower our blood pressure anyway. I know I nearly fainted.<br /><br />3 stars.<br />It would have been 4 but for the \\"then\\" padding. And for what it's done to my appetite for granola bars. I couldn't stomach one ever again.

B007GCY8FS|4.0|Reacher novels are a bit formulaic, but none the worse for that. Very smart investigative work, punctuated with violence, usually ends in a very violent climax. Great fun!<br />Lee Child is an excellent plotter, one of the best, and his characters are well crafted. His writing style, whilst not elegant, is economical and has good pace. It does not take long to read a Reacher novel: Once I start, I find it hard to put down.<br />Overall, great entertainment if you like this sort of thing.<br /><br />And I like the use of the names of British soccer players for some of the characters.
B0083EW97W|3.0|It's not a bad album, but nothing really stood out to me. I've been able to listen straight through previous Mayer albums dozens of times, but this one just isn't doing it for me for some reason. The style is just a bit too different I guess.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|As you will note, I have given this movie five stars.  I will add that these are an enthusiastic five stars.  The primary reason I have rated this film so high is that I personally have added it to my \\"most favored\\" list.  I have watched this thing about six times now and was as delighted during the last viewing as I was with the first.<br /><br />Now I realize that not everyone is going to be as enthusiastic about this film as I am.  As a matter of fact, some folks will absolutely hate the thing.  That is okay though - hey there are thousands upon thousands of movies out there and no one can like them all and no one can hate them all.  First let me start though by telling you (as I see it) what this movie is not:<br /><br />Even though the three male stars in this movie; Jack Black, Owen Wilson and Steve Martin are three of the funniest men in the film industry, this movie is not what you would call hilarious.  The supporting cast which includes Time Blake Nelson, Dianne West, Brian Demehy, Angelica Huston, Rosamund Pike and Rashide Jones are a very talented group of actors yet there is not one hint in the movie of \\"acting envy.\\"  Not once have I detected a hint of professional jealously or competition.  This is not a high action, high drama or intense movie by any stretch of the imagination.  There are no killings, no zombies, vampires or werewolves, no brooding teen stars, nothing gets blown up and there are no hot sexy sex scenes from the beginning to the end.<br /><br />This movie was loosely based on the book with the same title written by Mark Obmascik, 2004.  This, by the way, is a wonderful book; one which I have read twice.  The original book was based upon a real life situation, i.e. tracking three men (the men portrayed in the film) while they were attempting a \\"Big Year.\\"  For those of you that do not know what a big year is read the product description offered above.  The movie is partly true and partly fiction.<br /><br />I suspect that those who are interested in birding or are birders themselves will appreciate this film more than those who are not consumed by this \\"hobby.\\"  I will tell you that the movie very accurately portrays just what fanatical birders are and what they are capable of.  It catches the essence of the competition perfectly and addresses the \\"problem\\" with complete and absolute obsession.  I know of what I speak here as I am one of those unfortunately obsessed myself so I perfectly understood where these three men where coming from.<br /><br />The acting in this movie was excellent as each actor played the part he or she was assigned perfectly.  Each actor made the part he or she was playing perfectly believable and this is as it should be because, yes folks, there are indeed many, many individuals out there in the birding world just like what is portrayed on the screen.<br /><br />I found this to be a very mellow film and a wonderful break from what we are dished out these days.  The story had a quite, respectful and whimsical dignity about it that for me was captivating.  I was entertained and I could most certainly relate.  As a matter of fact, I think I am going to give this one another viewing this evening...the dogs and I.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarksinterested in birding or are birders themselves will appreciate this film more than those who are not consumed by this \\"hobby.\\"  I will tell you that the movie very accurately portrays just what fanatical birders are and what they are capable of.

B008I34Z3Y|5.0|For those who consider listening to music as a way to pass the time, or consider listing to music for entertainment, or, and this is where I fall into this category, consider listening to music as a way to explore emotional feelings.  Listening to music tracks do things to emotions in people in different ways.  Dead Can Dance's (DCD) latest album, Anastasis, does a very good job at fulfilling these emotional explorations.  I highly recommend this album to those that find listening to music as important as keeping one's house clean, or as important as enjoying a deep friendship.

There is no weak track or CD filler, production is excellent & great execution of good compositions.<br /><br />On overall, you have a great CD release by the jazz maestro Lee Ritenour in 'Rhythm Sessions' : wonderful collaboration of veterans & newcomers. A highly recommended CD listening pleasure.
B000JMKO3C|2.0|I am only 50% through this novel and I'm not terribly motivated to finish it. I thought the concept of this book was interesting. A 24 year old woman, Veronika, decides to take her life after she can no longer go through the mundane routine of everyday life. As the story progresses, other characters reveal their thoughts about life and death, as Veronika struggles to grasp the enormity of living in a mental hospital with days to live. That's the interesting part of this book.<br /><br />However, the author spends more time than necessary philosophizing about life and the choice to commit suicide. He even inserts himself as a random character in the beginning of the novel, which is very strange and disruptive to the flow of the book. This philosophizing goes on for pages at a time, through the perspective of different characters, stunting the readability of the story.<br /><br />I would recommend Veronika Decides to Die to those readers who do not mind a slow plot with a lot of description of thoughts and questions about life. This book simply wasn't my cup of tea.
B005LAII62|5.0|The makers of \\"ParaNorman\\" made history with this film; never before has an animated movie introduced an openly gay character (unless you count Ken from \\"Toy Story 3\\" because who was he kidding). Finally a movie studio had the guts to make this progressive move for the film industry. There are millions of kids out there who are told by a backwards society that they are second-class citizens because of who they love. These kids have been wondering when a movie might be made featuring a boy looking for his Prince Charming. The character Mitch wasn't the main character, but this is a step in the right direction.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Don't look for too much character development here. These characters were developed extremely well in their respective solo ventures. Don't look for an intricately written plot. That is not what this film is about. What you do want to look for is F-U-N! That spells FUN... the dashes are silent for those serious, angry 2 & 1 star reviewers.<br /><br />Why does this movie rival all other Hollywood films out there? Because it is simply a good time. No preaching. No depressing realism. No pretentious thematic contrivances used to help you ponder the depths of your soul. No. This is a movie: a audio/visual device designed to burn 2.25 hours of your life away just for the heck of it while having a good time in the process.<br /><br />No single comic book or graphic novel fully develops 5 or more characters simultaneously. Multiple stacks of many different comics develop many characters and they will sometimes all come together for a fun single comic book story arc which is purely things blowing up and people fighting... and this is it.<br /><br />Great movie. Not a whole lot of extras, but if it were up to me, I'd want a single Blu-ray disk for $15 with just the movie and nothing more. But that's just me.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|First of all, this is a very easy and fun to read book.<br />It's been said that information is power, and this book is full of power.  I knew some of the stuff before, because I used to do cycling, but It took me years to find out many of that stuff, and in between I made a lot of mistakes. This is a great book, because it presents all this knowledge (and more) in a very easy way to understand, and once you know how your body works, you can start to make progress.<br /><br />The book, covers all the aspects you need to know, how the body works, how to eat (with lots of info about supplements), how to train, and even touches the mental factor, so I definitely recommend this book.

B005LAJ1HW|4.0|By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS<br /><br />Poor Nucky.<br />In the second season of Boardwalk Empire we learn Jimmy, Eli, and the Commodore are serious about  their plot to remove Nucky from power.<br />If HBO intends to stick to the truth things do not end well for Nucky.<br />That's right, Enoch \\"Nucky\\" Thompson is based on the historical Enoch L. Johnson,  a political figure who rose to prominence and controlled Atlantic City, New Jersey, during the Prohibition period of the 1920s and 1930s. The real \\"Nucky\\" fell to real problems, not being honest with the IRS and the fact that in 1933 brought the repeal of prohibition.<br />Anyway, back to the show. James \\"Jimmy\\" Darmody (Michael Pitt), who worked for Nucky, has gone into business for himself. He has plotted with Elis \\"Eli\\" Thompson (Shea Whigham), Nucky's younger brother, who is sheriff of Atlantic City to overthrow the corrupt treasurer. They've both fallen under the spell of Commodore Louis Kaestner (Dabney Coleman) who is Jimmy's biological father. The mother Gillian Darmody (Gretchen Moi), has a creepy relationship with her son. She's also had relations with Nucky, and is Charle \\"Lucky\\" Luciano's lover.<br />Things go haywire when the Commodore has a stroke. Other gangsters who have been brought into the fold start to wonder if Jimmy and Gillian can pull anything off without the Commodore.<br />Along the way Nucky has trouble with family, the law, the IRS and the federal government.<br />The second season has received 12 Primetime Emmy Award nominations.

B008RV5K5E|5.0|It probably should be considered sacrilege to be a Batman fan and not be absolutely gaga over The Dark Knight Returns, but, strangely, I never was a giant fan of Fran Miller's grim take on Batman's future. Don't get me wrong, it's a good story, and one of the better Batman tales out there, but I never quite regarded it as definitive or superior to the many other worthwhile takes on Batman. Amazingly however, TDKR Part 1 did what very few film adaptations are ever able to do and - in many ways - improved upon and surpassed it's source material.<br /><br />The changes are immediately apparent. While the film opens in the exact same way as the comic, gone is the hard boiled noir inner monologues that gave the original comic it's Sin City-esque tone, gone is the constant drone of newscasters and polipsy babbling, and in its stead is little more than the grim, dark adrenaline of Bruce Wayne pushing its racer to its limit, as a musical score that blends Hans Zimmer with John Carpenter plays quietly in the background.<br /><br />The newscasters pop up soon enough - make no mistake, no story beats are missed or forgotten about - but the subtle tweaks in its presentation turns the film from a definitively noir, comic booky experience, into something even more sinister and brutal. It's still unmistakably Batman, but with it, comes the slick and eery overtones of 80s sci-fi and the ultra-violent twinge of the 80s actioneer. Being an animated film with a running time of scarcely 76 minutes, it's obviously not quite up to par with Blade Runner, and RoboCop, and the original Terminator, but it without question borrows heavily from those pieces to create a strangely iconic, strangely unique 80s futurist vision of Batman.<br /><br />Which, if you've read the comic, I'm sure you'll say it's what it always has been. The source material definitely lends itself to that sub-genre that was burgeoning in Hollywood when Frank Miller first penned the comic back in 1986, but again, it's onlyenhanced and improved by the film crew's creative decisions and direction.<br /><br />Outside of its overall presentation, the next overwhelming strength for the film, is the characterization of Batman himself. After reading the comic, I was hardly sold on the grizzled, militaristic Batman that Frank Miller made famous, but on film, and voiced phenomenally by Peter Weller (of RoboCop fame, ironically), the over the top characterization of the comic is, once again, transmuted into something much cooler, sleeker and simply exuding 80s cool and bravado.<br /><br />To say that Batman is at his best - his coolest, his most violent, his most broken and intriguing - would not be a wholly incorrect statement to make. While I positively love Michael Keaton's portrayal of Batman, and while I respect the detail in which Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale explored their Batman's psyche, Weller's Batman has a fierceness that both of those interpretations lacked. He is, to be blunt, a bad ass. More RoboCop, John McClaine, Snake Pliskin than the wounded soul that Keaton and Bale were.<br /><br />The final striking aspect of the film, honestly has to be its direction and overall sublety of its screenwriting. During the opening act of the film, we're treated to several moments of Bruce Wayne's inner demons and his continued obsession with his parents death in several flashbacks and hallucinatory episodes that deliver that age old psychosis of Batman in possibly the most sophisticated yet troubled way I've yet seen on film.<br /><br />On top of this surprisingly mature writing is a level of direction and shot selection that I've seldom seen in animated, direct-to-video filmmaking. It's balantly obvious that director Jay Olivia truly strove to make a movie that is more than just an hour-long marketing ploy. He really seemed to want to make something truly special and individual to the series of DC Animated movies; a love letter to the original work, to the action films of our collective, 80s childhoods, to Christopher Nolan's recent entries, and, of course, to the character himself.<br /><br />All in all, this care, attention to detail and talent in adaptation, acting, and direction imbibes The Dark Knight Returns with a level of quality and maturity that is rarely seen in this genre of film.

B002SAUCBC|5.0|I think Stephen King is at his best when he's telling me what is going on inside of his characters. In many of his books, I have endured, speed read or skipped the monsters, just to get back to reading more about the characters. I own several that I will never finish because the monsters played too big a part. To my delight, there are no monsters here, just King at his best.
B000FC2ROU|4.0|The writing is very easy going and very interesting to read. The way the author depicts like everybody is acquiring a higher level of consciousness is appealing to the reader. It makes you want to continue reading until is finished. I would read another book by this author.

0525953728|5.0|This is much more than a story of that day when UBL was killed.  This details what goes through the minds of these great HEROES!  What they have sacrificed is beyond comparison.  They do it because they want to and they do it because of their patriotism to serve their country.  The way this book is written is first person but you get to know all of the characters of this book. I felt at the end that I knew them all. The training that they go through to be the best of the best - a Navy Seal is very interesting and well written.  Best \\"war-type\\" book I have read / listened to.  As a disclaimer, I listened to the audio of this book.  I couldn't wait to finish it.  It actually brought tears to my eyes at the end.  These men did what they did, and sacrificed their lives day in and day out.  This book was to get the real story out from their point of view and because they were there.  So much has been said about Navy Seals.  This book doesn't give you any top secret information about them or their training.  Instead, it allows you to know them and what they do to protect our country.  Great book. It would be an honor to actually meet the writer or any of the characters.  THEY ARE THE TRUE HEROES OF THAT DAY!!!!  It's ashamed just as they said that it is used now for re-election.

1478343516|2.0|Very poor quality book. It feels like home made cheap copy.<br />I got an impression, that it is printed using regular laser printer on letter size paper.<br />The worst thing is that there is no single page number which makes full table of content completely useless. Imagine finding necessary page in two-three hundred page book which doesn't have page numbers... I'm I supposed to count those pages?

B001KVZ6HK|4.0|I really like this movie. Its story was well told and the acting was also well done. I am going to watch it again then provide a fresher review. It is worth noting that 4 cents for an upgrade to a 3D-Bluray set is a hell of a bargain!

B007GCY8FS|5.0|For anyone who has followed Jack Reacher, this is another example of a hero, not just a protagonist.  Unconventional but solid as a rock.  I never tire of reading these stories, even when the plots are increasingly improbable, because the characterizations are so good.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|I originally purchased the Cosmonaut for my boys, who are five and three years old, to use for drawing and writing on my iPad. The wide grip is what first caught my attention as I thought it would be comfortable to hold, but I also liked the uni-body design, which meant I wouldn't have to worry about them pulling the tip off. I already own two other stylus, one by Elago and the other by Griffin. While both are nice and get the job done, I've found myself using the Cosmonaut more because of how comfortable it is to use. Although the tip is wide and won't provide you with pencil precision, it's great for drawing and writing on the iPad. My boys love using it as well and as a plus, it helps to keep their smudgie little fingers off the screen. Hope you find this review helpful.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|totally addicted to this game. its the first thing I do when I get up in the morning. I'm pathetic....lol
B0085776BG|5.0|I thought this movie was fantastic! Even the wife liked it. We would both watch it again. Lots of action and good acting. Represented well the brave men who fought for our country. Well done!
0756405890|5.0|This is one of those books that is so fabulously engrossing that you find yourself putting off important things like eating and, for me, writing papers for grad school.  I would promise myself that I'd stop after the next chapter and then, 7 chapters later, would make that promise again.  And again.<br /><br />The story within a story is beautifully done and Kvothe is a complex and compelling protagonist. It's as interesting as GRRM's ASOIAF without being as schizophrenic.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie is so good I don't know how to put it in words!  Marvel did an amazing job with the story, casting, directing, visuals...It's just plain Awesome!<br /><br />Plus, I recently bought a 3-D tv and let me say, the Avengers Blu-Ray 3-D disc was incredible!  It' looked just as good as in the theatre!  If you like action, adventure and certainly superhero movies this is the set for you!<br /><br />Avengers...Assemble!!!
B008NEVP1S|4.0|Like the album bio article mentions, this disc does seem like Aimee is harkening back a little to earlier days, but it still has an overall feel similar to F'n Smilers. It's yet another solid Aimee Mann record. I'm reminded of a comment I once read about Sonic Youth's albums- \\"the same but different\\". That's a pretty good way to describe Aimee's last few records. There are no great departures stylystically. To me that's a good thing, with this record you are going to get the Aimee you've come to know and Love, not Aimee trying to be _____. She takes long enough between records, and when she does bring a new one you know it's going to be quality songs. Downside to Charmer cd is the sound quality suffers from over compression in mastering, leaving you with a loud and crunchy disc. That is pretty much the norm for many cd's nowadays but a little surprising from Aimee Mann, who now supposedly has complete control over all facets of her releases. \\"Bachelor number 2\\" has very good sound and cd mastering, but I can't say the same for this new \\"Charmer\\" album- good songs, so-so sound quality.
B0083Z614S|5.0|this is a great story. i have enjoyed it since my son first asked for it when he was young. i love it.thank you
0307341577|5.0|I loved this book and couldn't put it down! Ms. Flynn is a fantastic writer and storyteller. In Dark Places you meet a young girl who is a survivor of a horrendous crime that left her mother and two sisters dead and her brother in prison for life. The young woman is devastated and unable to function, but is drawn into a group that strongly believes her brother is innocent. She is forced to return to that horrible night in her mind and try to understand what happened.....something she has been unwilling or unable to do for 24 years. The twists and turns of the story are fascinating and the reader goes along for the ride. You can't possibly guess the outcome, but you'll stay awake trying to figure it out! This is a great read!

B008RV5K4U|5.0|I've been a fan of this graphic novel for close to 20 years now.  In fact, it's my favorite graphic novel of all time.  So, I was stoked when I found out they were making it into an animated film.  Naturally, I pre-ordered my copy, so I got it via UPS today.  It was really cool of Amazon to ship it \\"early\\" so that it was on my doorstep on the day of its release.<br /><br />For starters, this is not the same as the graphic novel, but it's close.  Obviously, much of the \\"text\\" is missing, mostly the stuff dealing with Bruce's and other characters' interior dialogues.  They could have had the movie constantly narrated to include this text, but I hate constant narration, so I'm glad they didn't.  And, since it wasn't narrated, some of the interior dialog text has been changed into things the characters say, others are just expressed through actions.  Either way, it gets the point across without a constant narration.  Aside from that change, there are a few other minor changes.  Some parts are missing, mostly smaller parts, stuff that's not necessary to move the story along.  Some parts have even been moved to different parts of the story, I guess to change the flow slightly.  And there's a bit of added dialog that wasn't in the original comic.  Aside from those few minor changes, the story is mostly the same as the graphic novel.  People who are gung-ho about the movie makers sticking to the source material exactly will be disappointed by this, but I have no issues with it.  I thought the story came across well.<br /><br />Animation wise, this film is along the lines of the other animated DC shows and films, which is to say it's good.  The comic has more detail to it but, when you consider how many times something has to be drawn in a comic VS how many times it has to be drawn in an animated movie, it's easy to say why they did this.<br /><br />The voice acting was good.  I'm a big fan of Kevin Conroy as Batman, but Peter Weller did a great job.  So did everyone else.  I watched the sneak of part two on the DVD and I'm looking forward to Michael Emerson portraying the Joker in part two, even though I'm a huge fan of Mark Hamill as the Joker.<br /><br />Anyway, I enjoyed it a lot and I'm looking forward to part two.I watched the sneak of part two on the DVD and I'm looking forward to Michael Emerson portraying the Joker in part two, even though I'm a huge fan of Mark Hamill as the Joker.<br /><br />Anyway, I enjoyed it a lot and I'm looking forward to part two.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|Just like the elder Gotham cop tells the rookie, you're in for a show!  Frank Miller's \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" was and still is one of the best Batman stories ever told...period.  To see it very faithfully adapted for DC's animated movies is great.  Plus, they are trying to condense this story into the usual 65-70 minutes they do normally for their recent movies; they are making it longer to fully tell this tale the way it should be told.<br /><br />Granted, I feel they could've just produced a long 2 hour animated movie in one package instead of making us wait.  But in a way that's half the fun...leave them wanting, even begging, for more!  Which is what this story did in the first place when it came out.  This story almost single handedly turned Batman into DC's number one superhero.  Which I think is cool even being an overall Superman fan.  Speaking of the Man of Steel...<br /><br />Superman kind of becomes the bad guy in this story.  He's still technically on the side of right but he's a pawn, a puppet to be used at the beck and call of the government...which Supes allowed to happen!  Batman's presence is seen as a black hole on the \\"law & order\\" of the times in this story.  Superman is called in to stop him, and seems to agree why!  Before this story, Supes and Bats were always portrayed as close friends.  Miller turned that notion upside down and inside out.  He made a good point showing that while both heroes stand up against evil; their views on how to do it are completely different.<br /><br />I'm happy to see this story come to life and see the action.  The only thing better would be a live action version.  Ultimately this is no doubt going to be one of the gems in the DC Animated Movie crown.  I'd even like to see them do the sequel, \\"The Dark Knight Strikes Again\\", even though that story wasn't as good but it is the conclusion to the story.  Overall, great work DC...Keep `em coming!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|This is another excellent outing by Lee Child. I have read every Jack Reacher novel and Child never disappoints.  The plotting is super and this character always delivers.  Go Jack!  It's going to interesting to see if Tom Cruise can live up to the written character in the upcoming first Jack Reacher movie!

B008RNYNDM|5.0|I reviewed this film, seen at a barely attended screening,<br />for BOXOFFICE MAGAZINE in 1975.  I still haven't forgotten<br />it.  In those days, I being a sort of \\"rebel\\",<br />they gave me all the films no one else wanted to watch.<br />Usually, they were right - but in this case they missed<br />a \\"masterpiece\\" of sorts from another rebel: director<br />Ken Russell.<br /><br />LISTOMANIA is a fantasy biography of Hungarian composer<br />Franz Liszt, portrayed by WHO rocker Roger Daltrey<br />who delivers a way out performance of the composer as superstar.<br />THE DEVILS (still unavailable on DVD) is still considered<br />director Russell's ticket to ride to Hell; but, for<br />sheer outrageousness, in your face sexuality,<br />and unfettered imagination, LISZTOMANIA deserves a viewing by those<br />whose imaginations are not limited by time or space.<br /><br />Combining elements of Hammer horror (Richard Wagner as<br />a music vampire), Marvel Comics (Thor as a belching oaf),<br />and a lengthy sequence in Russia where Liszts's \\"bad end\\"<br />comes indeed to a bad end, LISZTOMANIA soars to a sublimely<br />ridiculous celestial pipe organ climax that will make you laugh out loud.<br />You've got Mr. Ringo Starr as the Pope, Oliver Reed as somebody in Russia,<br />and a topless Nell Campbell (Columbia from ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW)<br />to add to the mischief.

B009AQOZIS|5.0|I really had no idea what to expect from this album, but I was not disappointed. Listen to it for what it is, not for what it isn't! If you have to compare it to something, compare it to something that Steve Harris (to my knowledge) has not done before. Well done ol' chap! ;)
B008RYN44U|5.0|Look, I've been a fan ever since \\"Beacon Street\\", and I've listened to all of ND's albums. If there's one thing that's been consistent, is the fact that EVERY album is different. Gwen and the gang were never one for the same ole', same ole'. For them to crank out \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" Part 3 would be ridiculous and boring.<br /><br />The new album is a near perfect blend of ska tinged pop, which is not a bad thing at all. \\"Push and Shove\\" and \\"Settle Down\\" are pretty good singles, but \\"Looking Hot\\" is a bouncy, dancehall song that's impossible to sit still while listening to it. Other standouts are .\\"One More Summer\\", \\"Easy\\", \\"Sparkle\\", with its horns, is a callback to old school No Doubters, and \\"Dreaming The Same Dream\\", the coda, and possibly the album's best. I'm more of an alternative rock kind of guy, but I love and appreciate many genres. Not every song needs to be lyrically deep and serious. There's beauty in all genres, and if you're not close minded, and you're a real ND fan, than get this album.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|Well written, obviously with disdain towards the current administration releasing false accounting of a very daring, risky and successful mission. In spite of a leadership hole in Washington, the forces were well prepared to carry out the mission with precision and attention to details, making it seem almost routine.  The book gives insight to the sacrifices these men make to insure our survival in a difficult world. May the threats of reprisal against the author be seen for what it is, defense of a dysfunctional administration.

B004LROUNG|4.0|The Litigators is classic Grisham - all of the characters are delightfully flawed but fundamentally kind-at-heart.  I really enjoyed reading it.  I finished it in 2 days.<br /><br />The story follows David, an associate attorney at a high powered sweatshop law firm as he has a life affirming epiphany (in the form of a drunken binge).  He walks away from a 6 figure salary to join \\"boutique\\" law office of ambulance chasers.  There is a sassy secretary, two shyster attorneys with their own set of personal problems and an office dog what is not to love?  The story held my interest because I never quite understood how class action suits worked and The Litigators did a good job of explaining it.<br /><br />It is hard to go wrong with this book! Over all, I give it a B

B007GCY8FS|4.0|Once again Jack Reacher finds himself in the middle of a who-dunnit.  Once again he uses his brawn and brains, (and marksmanship), to settle the issues before all the good guys and gals die.  I love that Lee Child gives us the data needed to solve the mystery on our own while Jack is doing it in the story.  I also love that Lee is realistic enough to mention that during the shoot-em-up at the end, that all of the indoor gunfire has hurt Reacher's ears and lessened his hearing.  As any gun enthusiast knows, guns, (especially handguns), are LOUD!  In most of the stories or movies one encounters, the hearing of the shooters is never in danger or in question.  The world of gunfire simply doesn't work that way.  Dirty Harry would be totally deaf after the first six rounds from his  hand cannon.  Thank you Lee Child for remembering issues like these.  It's hard enough seeing Jack, the innocent walking man, finding himself embroiled in all of his adventures anyway, so keeping the action as real as possible is a huge positive for this reader.  I'm a Jack Reacher fan ... And I love the drama and the adventure and the mystery ... So I recommend this book highly.

B007B6VOG0|5.0|Love this album. There are songs for just about every mood. The catch about them is that you either love them or you dont, and a few songs require you to decide whether you like the band or not before hearing the songs. But all in all, I listen to this album several times a week.

B00005N6KG|5.0|I have had many woes trying to find a pair of in-ear headphones that fit my ear canals comfortably.  Anything with a bud tends to fall out during a run and anything with a gasket is uncomfortable and falls out!  This and the Sony MDR-J10 H.Ear Headphones with Non-Slip Design (Blue) are the only things I've found that work consistently.  I like this better than the MDR-J10 when it comes to sound quality and tangle resistance (a single uni-body headphone set will always do better than individual buds).<br /><br />Pros:<br />-ultra light weight<br />-stays put!<br />-good sound<br />-works with this \\"sweater\\" during runs (so far)<br />-fit's my ears comfortably<br /><br />Cons:<br />-sometimes a slight whistle of air comes in when it's windy or I'm running speed workouts.<br /><br />A picky runner's must have!
1401322786|5.0|I have loved reading Mitch Albom's works ever since picking up \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven.\\" His books always makes me think about life and what we tend to take for granted. That even though most young people nowadays wish time to move faster, always rushing from one place to another, we can still have a chance to turn things around and learn to appreciate those who are important to us in life before it's too late. And even when losing something or someone seems to be the end of the world, it actually isn't. It also gives hope, and although the two characters, Victor and Sarah, are very cliche, I think there are still these types of people around. The one thing I would have liked was if the book was longer. I finished it a little too quick and I felt like I wanted more. I wanted it to teach me more. Overall, it is definitely a great book that has some valuable life lessons in it.
B003VIWO9I|5.0|I don't know for sure that I Shall Wear Midnight is the final Tiffany Aching story, but it certainly feels as though it could be. After all, this has been a series about young Aching's ascent into full-blown witchhood, and as she faces down a truly horrific challenge in Midnight, there's a sense that she's completed that transition and passed with flying colors by the end. And while I won't lie and say that I wouldn't love to see more Aching stories, at least if Pratchett has ended this arc, he's ended it with an absolute masterpiece, giving us not only the best Aching book, but one of the best Discworld books, period. As always, Pratchett turns some amazing and hilarious phrases here, and it's hard to count all the times I laugh out loud from just his wry narration, to say nothing of the absolute anarchy provided by the Nac Mac Feegles that constantly follow Tiffany around. But Midnight is also fascinatingly, horrifyingly dark at times, with the plot being set into motion by a man who has beaten his daughter so badly that he's caused a miscarriage, and a lynch mob rising up against him. That's heavy stuff for a nominally young-adult novel, and it's to Pratchett's credit that he faces up to this darkness and shows what people - no matter what their age - must do if such darkness is to be put down into its place. As always, in fact, there are a lot of quiet lessons being taught in a Discworld book, from the importance of fighting against ignorance to the way that authority is often as much about appearance as it is power, but they never turn the book didactic. Instead, Pratchett creates his usual effortlessly funny, charming, and absolutely involving story, threading together dozens of plotlines into an ending that doesn't just tie up the book, but gives us a good sense of closure for Tiffany herself. As always, the worst part of a Pratchett book is having to end it, and that goes doubly here; Aching is one of Pratchett's most winning and wonderful creations, and whether she's attempting to settle an angry town or negotiating with tiny tattooed hooligans, her charm, wit, intelligence, and courage makes her a role model for any gender (but the fact that she's such a strong feminine role model is only another testament to why I love this book). I hope there's more Aching to come, but if not, it's gone out in the best way it possibly could, and that's something in of itself.ther she's attempting to settle an angry town or negotiating with tiny tattooed hooligans, her charm, wit, intelligence, and courage makes her a role model for any gender (but the fact that she's such a strong feminine role model is only another testament to why I love this book).

B008MG1E4A|4.0|If you want to know about the general mechanics of how the guys who kicked the door in operated. This is the book. Its kind of a slow start but really heats us towards the end as the raid is planned and conducted. The account is realistic and throws cold water on the hyped up Hollywood notions of how specops are conducted. These guys are just humans. But very skilled and professional humans that you don't want on the wrong side of you. Quick read.
0439023491|3.0|this book was pretty good, but not much happened...too short for me I think. Add another star if you're a teen/tween. Very suspenseful, like the first.

B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Hunger games is sick sarcasm about the takeover of the govt and children being forced to fight in a \\"game\\" until only one remains alive. I cant believe parents let their young kids watch and read this.
0385732554|5.0|Set in a dystopian society where nobody sees in color and \\"sameness\\" is the standard, The Giver presents original ideas about societal values.  At age twelve, each child is assigned the job they will perform for the rest of their lives.  Twelve-year-old Jonas, though, is selected to become the new \\"receiver of memory\\": one person who carries all the memories of the past.  As the story progresses and Jonas begins to receive memories of love, pain, hunger, sadness, he begins to realize just how shallow a life everyone in his community lives.<br /><br />I personally really have read and enjoyed this book many, many times, and I get something new out of it each time.  If you consider the motives behind the \\"sameness,\\" it doesn't seem like such a hard place to get to.  After all, what could be so bad about ensuring that everyone is fed and cared for, that children do not have to face neglect, or hunger, or their parents' divorce.  Ultimately The Giver presents the result of the choice to end these things, and the price was the loss of family, love, and true happiness.  This book has forced me to come to the realization that there must be pain in order for there to be joy, because if you don't know how far you can fall, how can you truly treasure what you are given?

0345803485|4.0|I think a lot of the reviews on these books are too harsh.<br />To start, the main female character, Ana, is young (21) and very inexperienced with men-as in completely inexperienced so to me that explains why the author portrayed her as this giddy girl in love and in awe of the main male character Christian.<br /><br />The first few chapters of the book I was nervous (I'm not a fan of anything like BDSM) and was thinking it would be too much, but it picks up quickly and turns more away from the harsh sex.<br />By the time I got to the 2nd book I was loving this series. It's graphic, no doubt, but an excellent love story once you realize what Christian is really all about.<br /><br />I recommend it for anyone not afraid to read something explicit and seeking an unusual love story.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|My brother-in-law recommended Lee Child's Jack Reacher series to me and if the rest of the books are as good as the first, I am glad he did. Killing Floor is the first of the series. It features a unique plot, fast-paced action and a few surprises along the way. Not heavy reading at all, but very enjoyable.<br />The writing style was interesting, too: a lot of short, choppy, to-the-point phrases and sentences - more along the lines of the way we think rather than the way we speak. The style seemed a perfect fit to the hero's personality and made the book flow quickly.<br />Apparently the books in this series do not have to be read in the order they were written, but my brother-in-law has read them all and said he has seen some references to story lines in earlier books. I will most likely read them in order, too, so...bring 'em on, Amazon!

0345803493|1.0|I am so irritated by the leading character in this book! She has absolutely no clue about anything! I've been trying to enjoy these books, but I find myself throwing the book across the room from frustration before I can get to the next chapter. She is completely insecure, clueless about relationships and totally naive! Am I the only one thinking that she is a complete ditz for wanting to go to New York with her perverted manager who continues to make inappropriate advances on her- um, hello he wants to molest you dummy!! Your boyfriend is rich, why do you think he would allow you to pay for dinner, and please tell me why do you get upset when he wants to buy things for you...he's RICH!!! First you run from him because of the red room, now your upset because he doesn't want to take you back in there because of his fear that you'll leave him again...just clueless. She is constantly talking about Mrs. Robinson; move on- you can't build a relationship if you continue to focus on the past. Does he love me, he doesn't love me, can he accept me for who I am, am I enough for him...blah blah blah!!! I honestly don't know if I will be able to finish the book or the next one at this rate. If they are going to make a movie from this trilogy, I really hope that the director does a helleva lot better than the author, because I'm fisting my hair, biting my lip and screaming holy sht at how upsetting this book is turning out to be.

B000YJ85BI|5.0|The Last Colony did not disappoint in the least!  Scalzi continued his energetic and creatively brilliant style to the end.  It is surprising how he is able to weave all the minute details into critical jump-off points without losing the reader.  The only disappointment I found in the book was in the author's remarks at the end where he indicates that the series is finally over.  I will be checking out some of the spinoffs, especially the ones that have gotten great reviews.

B009B50QOU|3.0|Everyone keeps saying how on this album Green Day strayed from the Rock Opera genre and returned to their roots with this album to make a new punk album.  Well, they did return to their roots in the sense that they returned to make shorter pop songs that don't tie in to a greater story but their punk roots are greatly toned down.  The punk influences are evident but the melodies and catchy hooks common on a Green Day album are rarely evident.  There are a couple fun tracks here that I enjoy like \\"Nuclear Family\\" and \\"Let Yourself Go\\" to name a couple but overall the album is lacking.  The energy on previous albums such as Dookie or Insomniac is missing.  Bands mature and so does their sound, so I didn't go into Uno expecting a recreation of Doookie, but this album is not living up to the high bar they have set for themselves.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|I thought this was one of Lee Child's best books.  I could not put it down.  I am a big fan of Jack Reacher.  This book was the best of the last two or three and reminded me of Child's earlier books.

B007GCY8FS|2.0|By far the most disappointing Reacher novel in the series.  The last two books were not well developed and Jack Reacher's character lost a lot of his appeal.  Lee Child would do well to skip the publishing deadlines and concentrate on bring Reacher back to life.

The author writes from his personal experience and what I liked most about this book are the chapters devoted to his early training and experiences.  The book always rings true and is absolutely believable in it's entirety.

B008J34466|4.0|When last we heard from Pink, on \\"Funhouse,\\" she had separated from her husband, and, despite a couple of riotous tracks, the album was mostly a somber exploration of conflict, regret, and loss. Since that release, Pink and her husband reconciled, and the two had a baby. So part of me was expecting an album full of songs about personal and maternal contentment.<br /><br />Well, not so much. On \\"The Truth About Love,\\" Pink is as much the feisty, rebellious, foul-mouthed pop star as she's ever been. The album starts with \\"Are We All We Are,\\" the type of anthem for the disenfranchised that Pink excels at making (it's so topical that it may as well been written a couple of weeks ago after Mitt Romney's notorious \\"47%\\" comments). Following that is the lead single, \\"Blow Me (One Last Kiss)\\", the kind of \\"better without you\\" pop/rock tune that Kelly Clarkson often delivers, but Pink puts her stamp on it and sells it with her trademark cheeky wit.<br /><br />The third song and second single, \\"Try\\", is an affecting ballad, but it's with the fourth track, \\"Just Give me a Reason\\" that things start to get more interesting. Pink has often done duets with a variety of unexpected musicians in the past (Steven Tyler, Peaches, The Indigo Girls, Linda Perry), but her collaboration here with Fun. frontman Nate Ruess is very intriguing. Maybe it's because the mixture of his romantic tenor and Pink's rough, raspy alto cast Pink in the more masculine role of the romantic duet. Lily Allen offers a sassy bridge on the following track, \\"True Love\\", which is perfect, because the song, about a soul mate who you alternate adore and want to strangle, sounds like a song she could have easily written. The album's third guest star comes later on \\"Here Comes the Weekend,\\" when Eminem stops by to add some caustic bravado to the party anthem.<br /><br />Pink has always walked a thin, fine line between being a pop star and a genuine musical artist (a very hard line to walk indeed, and truthfully, few have done it successfully over a long period of time). With \\"The Truth About Love\\", despite some surprising collaborations and heartfelt vocals, Pink skews more toward the pop star side. Which is fine ... the world needs quality pop music. But I also look forward to the day when maybe Pink will retire from trying to satisfy the mainstream, and show music fans what she's capable of when she's not bound by pop music restrictions.have done it successfully over a long period of time).

B001P5HI4A|5.0|When I herd the director speaking in a television interview about this release I knew immediately I would be getting hold of it because the copy of the film I had just didn't look the same as it had done in the cinema - it had been automatically colour corrected in the process of producing the first release DVD - meaning that all the brown and golden sepia hues of the film had been washed out to look stark and blue.<br /><br />Now that it has been released in this package with the original intended colour palate, it does make a big difference to the overall look of the film. This film is quite beautiful, as it tells a story that is both unusual and somewhat emotionally complex.<br /><br />A young woman (28 year old) pretends to be a man in order to study her cultures faith in detail - she breaks the rules of the faith to do this. As she studies she becomes involved with her study partner - indeed they are both deeply attracted to each other and these attractions form the core of the emotional journey - but they are both 'males' so they do nothing about the attraction. It gets rather complicated as a 'love triangle' develops between the two 'males' and a female... with Streisand singing her inner thoughts giving us a variety of insights into the emotional situation.<br /><br />I myself enjoy this sort of thing, while I know others may not. It is a musical film in the sense that songs tell parts of the story from a characters point of view - it is no more crazy than most musicals of this nature, but is classy and beautifully photographed with some great performances, not the least from leading players Barbra Streisand, Amy Irving and Mandy Patinkin. The additional director input through some out takes and deleted scenes are interesting and add value to the overall package. I am a Streisand fan - I like her style of film making and I really admire her for getting this much maligned movie up and into cinemas. It was a very unusual film when first released, and even nowsome thirty odd years later it still has a certain something that renders me fascinated by the story, and engaged in the music.

B005S9EJ14|4.0|Here'e The Lowedown on \\"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\\" (A Drama DVD review)...LIKED IT!<br /><br />Become a fan of \\"The Lowedown\\" on Facebook<br /><br />Genre: 8.5 Movie 7<br /><br />What's it about?<br />British retirees travel to India to take up residence in what they believe is a newly restored hotel. Less luxurious than its advertisements, the Marigold Hotel nevertheless slowly begins to charm in unexpected ways.<br /><br />What did I think?<br />This movie was \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" meets \\"Cocoon\\". I found it a witty comedy with a great story.  It's too bad I could not associate myself with anyone...save the hotel owner.  I have probably said too much.  In closing, this movie is definitely worth watching...just not sure I would see it more than once.
B005LAII7G|3.0|I must confess to be in the minority in my reaction to Dredd 3D as I found it a very uneven mix.  Parts of it - mainly the 3D parts showcased in the early parts of the film and in the climactic scene near the end - I felt were dazzlingly well done, one of the rare instances where I felt a film made truly good use of 3D.  But the rest of the film, the bulk that lies between those two dazzling parts, I found to be tedious, cliched and highly derivative, particularly of 1981's Outland with Sean Connery, from which most of the plot developments in the middle were basically lifted.<br /><br />Directed by Pete Travis from a screenplay by Alex Garland, Dredd is adapted from the long-running British comic book character Judge Dredd, originally created by John Wagner (writer), Carlos Ezquerra (artist) and Pat Mills (editor) back in the 1970's. Set in a highly dystopian future about seventy years from now in which most of what's left of civilization is a savage urban ruin and the only source of law and order are the Judges, a mobile police force in which each Judge combines all law enforcement functions rolled into one: policeman, judge, jury and executioner. Particularly executioner.  They are heavily armed, heavily armored and empowered to dispense justice on the spot as they see fit. Dirty Harry crossed with the Terminator, in spades.<br /><br />The film begins in Mega-City One, a violent megalopolis of 800 million sprawled across the east coast of the US. Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) is in pursuit of a vehicle whose occupants are using \\"Slo-Mo\\", an addictive new drug that slows the user's perception of time to one-percent of normal. After chasing down and taking out the offenders with his Lawgiver, a special Judge's pistol that fires six different types of ammunition, Judge Dredd returns to base and is assigned by the Chief Judge (Rakie Ayola) to conduct an assessment of a rookie Judge named Anderson (Olivia Thirlby). A marginal candidate whose performance in training was only middling and who has thus far failed to pass the necessary tests to become a full Judge, Anderson is being given another chance, mainly because she is something special: a mutant with strong telepathic abilities, a highly valuable asset to have in their line of work. Dredd begins his assessment by bluntly informing Anderson of all the ways in which she can fail and nothing about how she can succeed. This is not going to be easy.<br /><br />At the same time, in a 200-story slum tower block called Peach Trees, drug lord Madeline Madrigal (a riveting and deadly Lena Headey), known as Ma-Ma, punishes three outside drug dealers who intruded on her territory by having them loaded up with Slo-Mo, skinned and then thrown from the top of the tower, the drug making them endure their fatal fall for a hundred times longer than it actually takes. Dredd and Anderson respond to the reported homicides. Once inside Peach Trees, they track down the nearest drug den and assault it, arresting a surviving perp named Kay (Wood Harris), one of Ma-Ma's henchmen. While cuffing Kay, Anderson psychically detects his direct involvement in the murders. She informs Dredd of what she learns, but when Dredd tests her by asking if she's sure of his guilt to see what she'll do, she hesitates, then says she's \\"99 percent\\" sure. Dredd responds neutrally that 99 percent is not 100 percent. So Kay lives. For now.<br /><br />Learning of Kay's arrest, Ma-Ma quickly takes measures to prevent the Judges from taking Kay out of the building to where he can be interrogated about her operations.  After her forces seize the tower's security control room, Ma-Ma uses a terrified clan-techie (a very effective Domhnall Gleeson) to seal the building using its blast shields under the pretense of a security test, thus preventing the Judges from leaving or summoning help. After this point, the task for Dredd and Anderson becomes quite simple (and quite familiar): survive the hordes of bad people trying to kill you, and keep your prisoner alive in the process.<br /><br />To be honest, I'm somewhat surprised at the number of fans of the comic book who seem to like this adaptation.  I say this because what I really liked about the comic was the dark ironic humor that ran all through it, a quality that Dredd 3D is, in my opinion, utterly lacking. I can't blame Urban for this as I know from his performance in Star Trek that he can do subtle humor extremely well. The fault really lies in Garland's screenplay. One gets the impression that he never actually read the comics and just skimmed a wiki entry on the character to get a handful of basic facts to work from. And while director Travis does do a quality job with the action sequences, he too just didn't seem to get that humor is also about _timing_, robbing the few scenes which could have been darkly funny of the impact they might have had in more deft hands.<br /><br />The casting was something of a mixed bag as well. While I loved Karl Urban's McCoy in the Star Trek reboot and his Julius Caesar in the Hercules & Xena TV series, and while I consider him extremely talented and highly charismatic, I felt he was somewhat miscast here. In staying true to the original character, Dredd keeps his helmet on through the entire movie so that the only part of his face you can see are his nose, mouth and jaw, so for this role you really need an actor with a distinctive jaw and mouth. Talented as he is, this is something Urban lacks. This caused additional problems in the when other Judges arrive on the scene as I found it hard at times to tell them apart in certain scenes since, with the helmets on, they all tended to look alike. (I found myself actually missing Sylvester Stallone's Judge Dredd from the 1995 film because of his distinctive jutting jaw and perpetual sneering lip that made him easy to recognize even with the helmet on. The movie was largely crap but physically Stallone was perfect for the role).<br /><br />Olivia Thirlby was also, I felt, somewhat miscast as Anderson. Judge Anderson was one of the original characters from the comic book and rather different from the way she was portrayed here, but even ignoring that, it's just hard to visualize Thirlby's soft and pretty ingenue-ish Anderson as ever being able to really be a Judge. It's also hard to believe her having the tough-orphan backstory she supposedly has in the film. Acting-wise she does a creditable job given the limitations of the script, but they would've done better to cast someone with harder edges to her and the film would've worked better as well.<br /><br />On the plus side, Lena Headey's Ma-Ma dominates every scene she's in. Not surprising when you remember that Headey has also been Cersei Lannister in Game of Thrones, Sarah Connor from Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, and Queen Gorgo from 300. Even with her face made up to be seriously scarred, Headey is still darkly beautiful, tough and riveting, her eyes so piercing it's like watching a deadly cobra toying with her prey.  The parts of Dredd that work best do so mostly because of her. Also on the definite plus side is Domhnall Gleeson, the unnamed \\"clan techie\\" (that's the way he's listed in the credits) who carries out Ma-Ma's orders in tracking and trapping Dredd and Anderson.  Son of veteran actor Brendan Gleeson, Domhnall Gleeson is probably best known as Bill Weasley from the last two Harry Potter movies and the unfortunate Moon from the Coen Brothers' True Grit. In this film, Gleeson takes what might have been a throw-away part and throws himself completely into it, radiating a kind of jangled-nerves terror as he does Ma-Ma's bidding. (Note: Gleeson's eyes are subtly altered with special effects, hard to put your finger on at first but becoming more evident as the film goes on.  It's never explained why they're different however. I'm guessing that it might be because he's another mutant but it never comes up.)<br /><br />And as I indicated at the beginning,the most dazzling parts of the film are the 3D scenes where you're immersed in what it feels like for characters under the influence of Slo-Mo. It was a very creative use of 3D that fit perfectly with the plot, and I found the 3D capture of the smoke wisps in those scenes to be particularly fascinating. Most of the time I feel that the 3D in films is wasted or more often just pointless, but in Dredd 3D I felt that it did contribute in a real and meaningful way to the scenes in question.<br /><br />Recommended for the creative use of 3D in the drug sequences, for Lena Heady's performance, and for die-hard fans of the Judge Dredd comic book character. It's far from being the ultimate Judge Dredd film adaptation, but it might keep you until that much hoped for adaptation finally does happen., I felt, somewhat miscast as Anderson.

B008S0IJAM|4.0|I am so much more pleased with Aimee Mann's new album, 'Charmer'. That is, more pleased than I was with her last album.<br /><br />Save 3-4 songs on  '@#%&*! Smilers', it was, to me, her weakest album. I never said it was a bad album, just not as strong as some of her stellar disks. I know I have gotten push back on that from at least one reader....but I stick by my opinion.<br /><br />Mann has always been very consistent in her writing, producing and playing. You will see her mix it up with a more acoustic sound, or then go back to a synth vibe for a record, but for the meat of her music, she doesn't stray too too much from what she's always done as a solo artist.  At least this time there are a few twists that I haven't seen since maybe the Special Edition of 'Lost in Space'.<br /><br />\\"Charmer\\" is a stellar first cut. The vocal arrangement and phrasing is just great.  The second release, \\"Labrador\\" might have a fun(ny) video, but a song about your dog fetching sticks - metaphor or not - just didn't do it for me.<br /><br />I am a big fan of \\"Gamma Ray\\". It is one of those twists I mentioned earlier. I like the rockier aspect, which you don't always get to see from her at this level. Ditto with \\"Crazytown\\" - maybe not as rock oriented, but somewhere between rock and pop - and liking the almost Arcade Fire-like electric piano opening (seriously, listen to their \\"We Had to Wait\\").  \\"Gumby\\" is a truly '60's pop confection song - and I don't mean that as a bad thing.<br /><br />And \\"Living a Lie\\" is a very well done duet. Save a song or two with her husband, Mann doesn't do true duets and the blend of her and James Mercer's voice is a good match. Again, the vocal arrangements really work. I don't want a full record of duets from Mann, but she should try it more frequently.<br /><br />\\"Red Flag Diver\\" doesn't start off strong, but hey, it is different than most anything she's done and that's an ok thing. I have total respect for exploration, but the bridge does have a vibe that she already explored on 'The Forgotten Arm'. ...and is it ok to like a song for the background vocal arrangement more than the lead vocal (\\"Soon Enough\\")?<br /><br />Most bonus tracks are usually toss away tunes, but I'm liking \\"Brother's Keeper\\".<br /><br />Yes, Mann falls into all to familiar territory (\\"Disappeared\\", \\"Barfly\\", \\"Slip and Roll\\") - again, not a bad thing, but after seeing glimpses of grander music making, it's a little disappointing.<br /><br />The cover art, in digital booklet form is annoying. I'm sure in real life it folds or something, but in digital, half of everything is upside down. Nice concept, bad execution.<br /><br />It is nice to really enjoy an album - and that's hard to say since people don't listen to albums per se anymore. In the world of digital downloads, it's good to be able to go start to finish.vibe that she already explored on 'The Forgotten Arm'. ...and is it ok to like a song for the background vocal arrangement more than the lead vocal (\\"Soon Enough\\")?<br /><br />Most bonus tracks are usually toss away tunes, but I'm liking \\"Brother's Keeper\\".<br /><br />Yes, Mann falls into all to familiar territory (\\"Disappeared\\", \\"Barfly\\", \\"Slip and Roll\\") - again, not a bad thing, but after seeing glimpses of grander music making, it's a little disappointing.<br /><br />The cover art, in digital booklet form is annoying.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|Easy, good read. Great descriptions of how things happened in a fairly matter of fact way. The strong sense of brotherhood, teamwork, and exhaustive detailed training came across in the author's writing.

Seeing this story from the teacher's point of view sent a powerful message that should be heard by everyone.  I still cannot get this movie out of my head and it has been days.  It can tug on your heart strings and make you want to throw something at the TV at the same time. Don't take this decision lightly, but decide to watch this film.
B004EWFUQY|5.0|Very comprehensive book that offers choices, support and applicable information.  It is not a starvation diet, it is a fulfilling protein, low fat diet that changes one's body and reforms one's approach to food. What is unique is that can be maintained once the goal is reached and the cruise phase is complete.  By just following a low fat protein diet once a week for life, the weight will stay stable, preventing the inevitable increase of unwanted pounds.  Highly recommend!
098555780X|5.0|Book review    Paracord Fusion Ties  Volume 1 - Straps, Slip Knots, Falls, Bars & Bundles  by J.D. Lenzen of  Tying It All Together ([...])     Well, today the mailman delivered my cold weather keep warm and out of trouble kit for Winter, 2012 - 2013.  JD's \\"Paracord Fusion Ties - Volume 1\\".    Yes, with less than $100 worth of #450 or #550 paracord, a pair of sharp scissors, a ruler and a cigarette lighter or match I can keep busy all winter long reproducing JD's wonderfully creative straps, slip knots, falls, bars & bundles, tying from just after breakfast until well after dinner every day on which the weather is inclement.  No way I can get myself into too much trouble with that, is there?  (Sorry, Hon, please keep my dinner hot until I finish this one; I will eat it after... yeah, I know it will probably be cold by then... I will find it where?)     With collaboration from David \\"Stormdrane\\" Hopper (owner of Stormdrane.blogspot.com, and one of the world's finest paracord artisans) JD shot more than 800 professional quality images depicting, step-by-step, how to tie 35 beautiful pieces of artwork using paracord.  These projects range from the very easy to the ridiculously simple.  And with a little luck and snow on the ground, I should be able to complete Christmas tree ornaments, gift package decorations and even holiday gifts for family and friends, each for less than a dollar or two of paracord.  Oh.  And a few things I need or just plain want for myself.  After all, I am a product of the \\"me\\" generation.     JD starts by talking a bit about the history, types and sources of paracord.  There is a list of paracord vendors, although my favorite one is not on the list.  He talks about how to size items and how to snip and fuse the ends of the paracord.  Without fusing (or at least a drop or two of glue) the item you make may fray, unravel and become unpretty.    Now comes the good stuff.     I have seen and been shown a gazillion times how a two-strand diamond knot is tied.  But my spazdicity quotient prevented me from actually tying one.  Voiles.  With this book, I nailed it on my very first try.  Worth every cent I paid for the book.  Two-colored monkey's fists, balls and globe knots are, a snap to make using the clear instructional images contained on pages 7 through 16 of the book.  Demystification 101 by JD.     Using JD's step-by-step instructions beginning on page 10 on how to make a paracord ball, I stopped short of snubbing and finishing it off and made it into a necklace for my wife.  And I'm not all that creative, which shows the possibilities are endless.  So, next I am going to try to make an \\"Ashoka Chakra Knot\\" necklace for my daughter.    Solomon bars and variations thereof are the basis for all sorts of bracelets and fobs.  They are covered in great depth.  Even the elasticized Solomon bar bracelet.  I didn't know how to make an elasticized Solomon bar, which is a great for children.  Heck, I didn't even know such a thing existed.  Now I do.    Just pick up two or three 6 to 8 foot pieces of paracord in whichever colors catch your eye, trim and singe the ends, grab a cup of soup or your favorite beverage and while it snows outside let your imagination run wild to create new and unusual variations and patterns of this very popular tie.  And be sure to let JD see what you make.  He might just name it after you and put it in his next volume.  (Sorry, JD.  I didn't mean to commit you to writing another book.)    Incidentally, I have tied Solomon bar bracelets while watching television and then donated them to the Wounded Warrior Project, Breast Cancer Awareness, and a nautical museum of which I am a patron.  Ten bracelets cost me practically nothing to make, but they raise $100 or $150 for the organization when they sell them.  By the way, thank you JD for imparting the knowledge with which I make these donations to great causes.  Excellent fundraisers.  Also, following JD's images, I have taught children at museums, fairs and exhibitions how to tie these beautiful pieces of art.  Just about as simple and foolproof as it gets, and all for a few cents worth of paracord.     I have not a clue how JD's creative mind works.  I only know it does.  And it does well.  He shows on page 58 how to make a \\"chainmailed endless fall\\".  I don't know much about it except that it is made from three different color three foot long pieces of paracord.  Oh.  I also know that my wife will love one for a bookmark, and so will some of our children and grandchildren when they see it.  I think it is a pretty cool and unusual piece.  And I may try to use colorful utility cord (bigger in diameter than paracord) and try to make a small tapestry from this tie.     The book goes on and on and on, each project being prettier and more creative than the previous one.  Just look at the book's cover.  It is a fusion of colors; a fusion of ties.  When I begin to tie in the late autumn I might just work my way from page 1 to page 124, making each and every tie.  Then I can mount them randomly in a frame which, in and of itself, will be a great wall piece for my computer room.     My only real complaint is the length of the book.  It is too darn short.  But I guess that is what a next volume is for.    A number of tyers have created tools and jigs to make tying paracord fusion knots a lot faster.  I tie mostly for enjoyment and relaxation, so speed in not a factor.  However, it might be nice to mention some of these.  I started off making Solomon bar bracelets using plastic and metal buckles.  But I stopped using these items when I saw in this book just how easy it is to finish a project without them.  Some of these and their sources might prove helpful to some tyers.     This book is an excellent addition to my collection and would be as well to any knot tyer's or hobbyist's or craftsman's collection.  It is a great holiday gift for the person or even yourself who is mesmerized by knots and not tying.  I bet that after receiving the book you or the person who receives it will be making professional quality paracord fusion knot projects for all to enjoy.  Far, far better than the mass-produced stuff found in craft and gift shops.    Cap't. Walter Seltzer  The Knot Knut  Creative Rope Designs  Brooklyn, New York  September 11, 2012
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|This is a very smooth app for the Kindle Fire.  I found it entertaining if you like numbers games.  Mix between math and tetris.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|in response to a couple of reviews already posted:the dark knight published in 1986 was yes a four book series. HOW ever unlike the year one what ran in the regular batman monthly title (each comic is around 20 pages) this series was one of if not the first prestigious baxter  limited series and was 48 pages long per book. and the amount of detail story and art both was far more involved then the monthly series (which was almost as good as the dark knignt returns series)  just not as long. so why the part one and two  ... to give this ground breaking series a proper dvd/blu ray movie debut.... yes they needed a larger and yes the largest annimated format ever done in the new dc annimated movies series so sit back grab the arms of your chair and hang on here is the greatest batman movie ever done live action or annimated.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|one word for this novel - FASINATING ! I was very impressed. I found the entire North Korean culture descriptions fasinating and scary. An impressive read.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book seems to be very well written. It is interesting to read about the day to day activities and all the intervening experiences.  Amazon made it easy to purchase this book prior to publication.  It was delivered on time.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This was one of the first apps I installed on my Kindle Fire.  The best thing about this app is the ability to give remaining battery time for different activities like web surfing, games, and reading. It is great for time-management when you don't have the ability to recharge like a day at the beach, for example.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This is exactly like Bakery Story but u don't earn that much money. I think its a great game but don't let kids under age of 5 play this. Why u might ask because right when u start is says hurry limited time offer 20% off of gems. They are outragios prices for just such a low amount of gems. I reccomend this for 5 and older. Otherwise its a great game.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|So, last night I saw the concert for this album and it was amazing. It was my 6th or 7th Rush show and the string ensemble was amazing. They actually played this entire album in the concert and I loved it. I hadn't bought the album before the concert because I was a little disappointed in the Snakes and Arrows album.<br /><br />This one is awesome however and highly recommended and not just for Rush fans.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I find this game addicting even as an adult.. works great on kindle fire.. great for all ages.. you'll love it promise
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I like the Stephen King novels that spend more time on character and less time on the supernatural.  This one definitely falls into that category.  It's populated with characters who are so well drawn that I felt like I knew them by the time I reached the end.  Among the best of King's works.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The Hunger Games is a good story and a real page-turner. The only complaint I'd have is the lack of 'history' that might explain how this government formed and how long it had been in existence before the \\"uprising.\\" Still, I'd definately recommend it for any ages above 14. That way whole families might enjoy it and possible discussions on the 'have's and have not's' plus many other topics broached in the book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I waited for two days before writing my opinion... I needed this time to digest the idea of this series has ended. It was a splendid journey through Panem world, I couldn't keep my breaths taken through the different phases Katniss has been through, and the war between the districts and the Capitol was in many ways active and filled with plots that are very close to reality (I witnessed such things during my life in Gulf War I, II and the Libyan revolution).<br />My story started - as many people did, I think - with the movie, and during my visit to Canada I saw the series books hanging out at Chapters, so I said why not and grabbed the second book of the series. When i finished the book I immediately purchased the last book (this one) as a Kindle version - since I returned back to Libya where I can't get the printed one :( - and finished it in 3 days, re-read the entire series again during the following week, and I'm willing to read it again!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was a great book. It was well written and was very easy to read. I have no problem with the author sharing his military experiences.  He is an American hero and this nation owes him much gratitude for what he has accomplished.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book. I could not get any thing done for stopping to read every hour! I recommend the whole series.
B001QWC3PQ|5.0|This fine looking footwear is a gift to those who do not have the most stable gait.  They fit securely, provide support that would be outstanding for any shoe on any surface and are quite durable.  For those who share this problem, to be able to walk without an orthodic is a breath of fresh air for your feet and soul.  Those without issues can simply enjoy a great sandal.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great game for down time! takes me back to the old arcades.  good fun for everyone. I used to play this at the carnivals.
B006LSZECO|1.0|A very complicated absurd book. The writer keeps repeating the same thing over and over again. I dont undertand how can it be in the bestsellers list!
B00846TTDG|4.0|Good drama, good acting, fast paced, good action film that keeps your attention, actors were good and I read there were some real Navy personnel in this movie.
1400052181|1.0|Most of the book is about the sorry lives of Henrietta's descendants. Some of them were in pretty bad shape, but the author, while caring about them enough so they would reveal all their secret, did not even mention that the profits of this book will be shared by her subjects.<br /><br />I doubt she ever gave a penny to her subjects after this book came out. Just more exploitation and using people...
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book much exceeded my expectations.  The details were excellent without giving any military secrets!  Well written, easy read and very enjoyable.  I would highly reccommend this book to anyone that might be interested in how our country is secured!  The contributions of our armed forced are nothing short of amazing...
B008XG1X18|3.0|I've not had all the issues other reviewers mentioned,  but it does occasionally take 2 tries to get it to load. Usually loads quickly on the second try. nice for a free app.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|In keeping with the whole Jack Reacher mystique, this book delivers! Lee Child gives us yet another glimpse of our great country while having Jack emerge the hero. I am already anticipating the next adventure....just what is awaiting Jack in Virginia!?!
B004GUSG4M|2.0|I so wanted to love this book.  It seemed to hold so much promise.  I haven't connected with any of the characters.  It finally got to a \\"page turner\\" status at somewhere around  page 200+......only to disappoint with an uneventful turn of events.  I'm still plodding along, almost finished and haven't yet read anything that would make me recommend this to anyone.  There is no \\"thriller\\" in this psychological thriller.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I didnt expect to love this book as much as i did given that it is not my typical genre. But i had a hard time putting it down in all honesty. The beginning is a little dry but it was well worth the read. It is definitely a story that will keep you engaged; especially when you figure out who the &#34;wight&#34; hunting Jacob is (not going to spoil it though) :).
B008XG1X18|4.0|love the site...just not thru the fire...keeps force closing and having to restart. but the site itself is addicting .
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I read all the reviews and decided to take a chance. The game is very fun if you like this sort of game. It is just like the games you play at the carnival. The only downfall is you have to wait for more coins. Very fun and passes the time away and then you find yourself addicted.
B0087HT36U|5.0|One of my favorite Android titles. Can't wait for the Age of Cowboys levels! Keep up the great work, and miniclip!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I am a relative newcomer to the Jack Reacher series (\\"A Wanted Man\\" is the fourth or fifth book I have read), but I have already come to expect intelligent, well designed plots that are less formulaic than similar \\"good guy\\" mystery/action novel series (think: Dirk Pitt).  This edition of Child's series held my interest from beginning to end and required only minimal suspension of my sense of disbelief.
B0075MFS9Y|2.0|I don't know which song on this album inspired me to purchase, but I wouldn't do it again. I was on kind of a folk trip about a month ago and purchased four or five albums. If I were to sum up this band, I suppose I would say they're minimalist. While there's nothing inherently wrong with that, the production does not smooth any of the lumps out. It's brash at times and hard to listen to. The Lumineers like their yelling too, which can be a nice, folky thing to insert here and there, but they rely on this gimmick too much. I find myself only halfheartedly putting this CD in hoping I'll come around and then skipping half the tracks. It's too bad because I'm sure these guys are talented. They just need some time to work out the kinks.
B001U9BRNE|5.0|Being a specific music lovers and audio/Video Phil....would appriciate the complete idea of this concert and many thanks to David Foster and his Crews.What a wonderfull and lovely concert ever see on this Bluray and inspired me thats even there is some good music still exsist in this material world.<br /><br />I dont know how to thanks Mr.Hit Man but anyways would just say its awasome and the best concert on bluray even technically with best sound and video too.<br /><br />David you are the Best and now one can compete your by anyways.<br /><br />Highly recommended for decent music lovers and the performance giving by all the artists in Buray one and this follow-up is outstanding.<br /><br />Concert:- 5 out of 5<br />Video:-  4.5 out of 5<br />Audio:-  4.5 out of 5<br /><br />You will fall for it and best buy from Amazon.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This was an absolutely awesome story. The characters are people that you can fall in love with...very well written!! I would totally reccomend this book to anyone looking for a great romance novel!!!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I had purchased this book without the slightest idea as to what it was about or if it would be worth the time or money. I'm thrilled to say I was so surprised at the compelling story this book has to tell that I finished this book in under two days. This is a great book.
159562015X|4.0|I have bought over 20 copies of the strength finder for employees and we really like this book/test. When one employee scratched off the code and entered it online it said the code was already used. I don't need another book for the employee, but I would like a replacement code. Does anyone know how/who to contact about this?
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the second book; Katniss once again comes to the rescue and Collins continues to keep her readers on the seat's edge! I highly recommend this one as well as the entire triology!

B003Y3921S|3.0|I ordered this pair of crocs the same day I ordered a different style, and this one took a week longer to arrive...odd. Anyway, they are SO cute and I really wanted them to fit, but since they aren't slides, have the toe piece and the heel piece, my foot is too short for the 8 and too long for the 7. So back they gotta go.
B009329Y30|4.0|The movie was enjoyable. I watched it from the beginning to the end. I couldn't leave the room. I wanted to see what happened to the characters. Worth watching!
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I have been counting down for this day for the past month.  Their first album captivated me with the ingeniously arranged word choice of the lyrics mingling with the banjo chords.  I was so excited I didn't bother running through the song samples amazon provides; just clicked buy album. It didn't disappoint at all.  Track after track is perfection.  Expectations were met and far exceeded.
B000L53D4O|4.0|My litte guy loves playing with this toy.  I like that it doesnt have so much going on as some of the other walkers.  I get a little annoyed with all the blinking lights and sounds so this one fit the bill.  My 7 month old loves playing with the toys and loves using it to walk.  The only problem is that its pretty light weight so he pulls it over on him if he falls and the wheels are very fast even on carpet.  We dont let him use it as a walker unless we're holding it in front to slow it down but because it lays flat he still gets to play with it.  I'm sure once he gets more stable, this will be great!

B008Y2FRFO|1.0|I never played this sort of an arcade game before. I only hope it's actually more interesting at an arcade. This is incredibly slow.
B00006FM77|5.0|Once a upon a time, before the Age of Plastic, was a brighter simpler time when the things you touched were still real.<br />Where everything was original. Colors were more vivid, sounds were brighter and Hope, Justice and Love had not yet died. We had ideals and they seemed, for a time, to exist as achievable qualities to life.<br /><br />From that time comes this album. If you werent born in the 60s or earlier then you will likely never have heard such sounds as come from these artists at the peak of their craft. Chicago, Blood, Sweat & Tears, Three Dog Night, Queen, Yes, Aerosmith, REO Speedwagon, Alice Cooper, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, The Who, Nazareth, AC/DC, Black Sabbath, Blue Oyster Cult, and Kiss, Styx, Boston; this was the background sounds of the world. NO bands have ever been better in rock and these days they have to invent some new catagory to call themselves to be relevant.<br />These performers built the music that gets poorly copied today. They are rightly legends because nothing has come close since.<br />Today just about everything is homogenized pop, but at this time bands had original sounds and actual lyrical versus rather than one chorus repeated for two and a half minutes.<br /><br />The quality and conviction of the musicians in Chicago is evident from the first notes until the last refrain. This is breathing poignant music crafted to not just communicate a story but to evoke a series of emotions accompanying the story. Listening to this concert in its entirety (as it is intended) will move you into a mental environment you may not even realize is coming.<br />Of course, in the 70s, this is how we listened to music. We would lay back, headphones on, and fall into the music, our parents yelling at us in the dim distance to \\"take out the damn trash, and this is the last time I'm telling you!\\"<br /><br />Lastly, (is anyone still reading?) there is the idea that whatever music you listen to as a teenager significantly shapes the cultural tasteyou keep for the rest of your life. Something more, deeper, more elemental, than simply nostalgia.<br /><br />There are dazzling toys available today but the world seems largely soulless. Everything you know is replaced as obsolete after two years. God how I missed the enthusiasm and naivete of the 70s.<br /><br />sigh<br /><br />buy the album.
0811875555|4.0|i love this book, but sadly it did not reveal the art i was looking for...<br />I was very much taken by the opening and end credits of this new disney classic. The style appealed to me so much that i expected it to be in this book... But sadly they have not granted any space to the people who did a great job introducing and wrapping up the movie. The rest of the book is great. I have two girls who love to sit down and just watch how rapunsel evolves as a role model princess. Well worth the investment even though the art I was seeking is not part of it.<br /><br />Dennis from Wassenaar, Holland
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Early on in this book, the reader who is familiar with Jack Reacher will be quickly pulled back into his world.  It's tense, exciting, well-written.  Unfortunately, about half-way through, the plot becomes confusing, hard to believe, somewhat arbitrary, and rather plodding.  One way that I judge a thriller is by whether it keeps me up until late at night, unable to put it down and not desirous of sleep.  The first half of the book flies by, but later I couldn't get through more than a handful of pages before falling asleep, night after night.  The action at the end is more readable, but hardly satisfying.
0525953728|5.0|First let me say this is the first review I have ever written.  I chose to write this review because this story touched my heart.  The media portrayed this book to be written by a selfish man who was writing for his own recognition and greed to capitalize.  I was hesitant to buy this book because of this reason, but decided to read it and form my own opinion.<br /><br />In 2008 I had a loved one return from Iraq after his unit was injured by an IED in Iraq.  Each account of Mark's experience reminded me of conversations we shared upon my loved one's return.  He couldn't tell me much as he has a high security clearance with the government but what he often talked about was how much he LOVED playing with the boys!  Mark's depiction of the joking and constant pranking of each other was the only thing that made my loved one smile even as I could see the amount of significant tragedy he observed - but he loved it and would do it again if he was able.  A consistent message throughout this book is the sacrifices these men make while not thinking twice about it.<br /><br />I am so glad I chose to purchase this book.  Thank you to Mark Owen for writing it.  It is about much more than the mission to kill Osama Bin Laden.  It is written with his personal experiences, the tenacity, fortitude and strength that it takes to become the best of the best.  He gives the reader the opportunity to hear a first-hand account from someone who has served.  He captures the true spirit of the camaraderie of the men he worked with.<br /><br />In the end Mark encourages each American to support veterans through volunteer work or supporting organizations that are helping our veterans as they return to the U.S.  As one that has experienced first-hand a veteran that has come home and suffered from injury, PTSD, and the inability to re-adapt to life back here, please take a moment to be grateful for all the freedoms we have here in the U.S. and support your local community veterans.  I would definately recommend this book.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|This is definitely a 5-star sophomore effort from Mumford & Sons.  Many of these tracks sound like they could have fit in between songs on \\"Sigh No More\\", their excellent debut album.  From future albums, I'd like to see a little more diversity in their song writing and composition structure, but for a second album, I think breaking away dramatically from something you do well is a big mistake.  This should go down as one of the better releases of 2012.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|If you're looking for a simple, plain calculator to do basic, everyday math equations quickly and efficiently, this app is exactly what you're looking for. The buttons are huge, crisp and crystal clear on a sleek and attractive background, and feel very responsive.<br /><br />There isn't too much to say about it; it's a calculator, and it works exactly as a calculator should.
0375507256|2.0|I got the book on speculation.  I do that a lot.  Usually the speculation is the result of a friend's recommendation; occasionally it is the result of good reviews.<br /><br />It was good reviews that did it for me here.  I should have known better.<br /><br />This is exactly the kind of book that makes you feel you've done something special ... until you actually examine just what is was you've done.<br /><br />Enough generalities.  Let's get a little more specific.<br /><br />Take six novellas.  Each one is written in a different time period, different voice, different style, about different topics.  Each one is also ... well ... kind of insipid.  The story is interesting but it lacks substance.  Or development.  Or characters.  Or resolution.  One way or another, each novella lacks something that would make anyone want to buy it and read it.<br /><br />Fortunately for the author, if not the reader, I have only given the ingredients here, not the recipe.<br /><br />Now, starting with the second novella, have each story include a reference to the previous novella by a key character.  Make it appear that the previous novella will in someway influence or weave itself through this second novella.  But don't actually do this.<br /><br />Next, repeat the process from second to third novella, third to fourth, fourth to fifth, fifth to sixth (each successive novella is later in time than its predecessor).<br /><br />Finally, get a common link, something like the phrase \\"cloud atlas\\", for each of the novellas, pop it into the title, and -- voila -- a lengthy novel, advant guarde enough to make a reviewer feel like he is reading something special.<br /><br />Read it, and you think you have done something praiseworthy and can let your friends and neighbors know that you, too, can read a real literary masterpiece.<br /><br />Well, it isn't.<br /><br />Some of the stories are entertaining, but would never make it to literary masterpiece status without a lot (and I mean a lot!)more substance.<br /><br />If somehow you ended up with this book, try the following experiment:<br /><br />Cut out the first section of each novella and attach it to its second sectiony.  Read the novellas you now have, one at a time, without running them together.  See how each novella stacks up.  Give a single novella to a friend and solicit the friend's opinion, especially comparing this work to real literature.<br /><br />If you like what you read and it works for you, well, God bless you.  Ditto, your friends.  Every author needs a readership.<br /><br />Two stars:  For the possibility that this could have been much better.
B007HJB42U|5.0|This is powerful and magical look of a world shaped by the artistry of the artisans and artists who created it.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Nice way to pass the time, good value for a faotd. I cant think of anything else to say for this
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|nice realistic play, I play these when I find them in Vegas, too bad that the coins drop so much off the sides, this along with little increased bonus as you gain levels, also too bad it becomes more like a quarter sucking arcade game in order to buy more coins to play, otherwise fun
B0072NWJRK|5.0|This is a troubling and sad series of events, but as a narrative, a great story well told. Paul French has done his research well. He recreates a time and place vividly and without anachronism.  Peking in the 1930s, with Japanese troops increasingly on the streets and the Nationalist capital removed to Nanking, has the ultimate fin de siecle feeling, about 30 years late.  The haunted Fox Tower of the Tartar City Wall (now just across from Capital M Restaurant and the newly renovated Qianmen Street, just South of Tiananmen Square), the warren of hutongs just outside the legation Quarter, and the hothouse society of privileged and down-and-out expatriates living here is not just chronicled here, it is drawn with an artist's and master narrator's skill. Kudos to Paul French.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great app. Shows all power settings and how long it will last. Never wrong so far as I have seen.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I buy all my books from Amazon and am now transitioning to Kindle..I have read every Reacher book and WANTED MAN is another hit!!..I would highly recommend it to all Reacher fans..am looking forward to the next Reacher book which i will buy on Kindle..ENJOY!!...gdm
B008QE9XD2|4.0|I am an avid Vampire Movie fan and while I am too young for the original I loved the revival with Ben Cross. Too bad that was canceled and you don't get the closure to the story lines, the revival was so good and had such potential. Anywho, Barnabus was a charismatic man and Johnny Depp is so handsome but Tim Burton really blew the look for him and I agree with the other reviews that this version is way too silly and out there. You can't take away the talent of Johnny Depp because he did a great job and the casting of David was spot on but for the others, not so much.<br /><br />I still think you should see it, it is worth the view.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book takes you through the planning steps as well as the mission itself step by step.  I don't normally read military/war type books but I have to say I couldn't put this book down.  I picked it up in the morning and finished it the same day.  Give it a read.  You won't be sorry.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A must read. Couldnt put the book down. Excellent book. Would read it over and over again.i think every woman wants a christian in their life.
0143123173|3.0|So I bought the book because I liked the television series and I had never heard of the books or author. Also, James Lee Burke's constant preaching about the evils of everyone his main character had yet to kill had grown tiresome. Anyway, I was ready to try something else. This is one of those rare instances when an adaptation is better than the original. The book drags. I mean is there a murder to investigate or not? If so why take half the book getting around to it. And the guilty party? Talk about dropping one out of the sky. I plan on continuing to watch the television series if it is continued but I don't  plan on reading another book in this series unless someone can convence me I should.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It kept me wanting to read more! It was a  interestingly inspiring and motivating. the storyline was great :)<br />A
B007GCY8FS|3.0|As far as the Reacher series is concerned, this is not the best book ever.  But, it's a great read...it keeps moving...Reacher, as always, is a highly enjoyable character...and it's a pretty good storyline.  If you like Jack (nothing) Reacher, you'll like Wanted Man.  If you've never read any Jack Reacher books, go back and start with The Killing Floor :^)
B000W4KSWO|5.0|Two giants in a classic combination of fire, heart and intellect. While generations apart, the master of big-band jazz and the deeply religious soul of Coltrane mesh perfectly. Nothing more needs to be said!

1452110581|5.0|I loved everything about this book.  My dearest Clemenza passed away recently.  He was named after one of the gangsters in the old Godfather movies - the fat one who always cooked the pasta.  My Clemenza weighed 18 pounds when I adopted him at the SPCA.  He was already 6 years old, but he was my gorgeous and loving friend for every day he lived with me and tolerated me.  Anne
B007STBUIW|5.0|I love this film. I have not seen it for several years. I do remember watching it on TV in the late 90s and thought to myself how crappy the picture looked. Now Universal has fully restored the picture and sound for this 100th Anniversary release. Given the impossible conditions in which Jaws was made, this film is a cinematic miracle that launched Steven Spielberg's career. Sure the shark (Bruce) is mechanical and fake, but I love him! CG would have killed this film. The restoration is perfect!!! Universal did an amazing job and even provided a featurette highlighting the process. Steven should have walked away with the Oscar for this one! 5 STARS!
B0090P98Z4|4.0|good game I enjoy playing it.  It is very diabloesqe and it makes me happy to destroy enemies.  I'm awesome and love android apps and I love writing reviews.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|I am bias. I love this character. And the book lived up to what this character is about. A Righteous Man! But in a no-nonsense butt-kicking kind of way.
B008XG1X18|5.0|So excited to get this app on my Kindle Fire.  It works Great.  I have access to everything easier than on my pc.  My boards are just a shift away.  This is a must have app!
B008D28HYS|5.0|This game is really fun to play.  Its not so much a game but a puzzle.  The pictures are cute and it is definately addicting. My only suggestion is go have some hints or error checking.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I am afraid Jack might be running of steam. Not nearly as good as some of the earlier Reacher yarns. Looking forward to a better effort next go around
B0096DFBZQ|5.0|get it now do it i know why it is the top app right now because it is cool i love how it has multiplayer.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game. finally minecraft pocket edition on kindle. the graphics on the kindle make it more real. it would be sick when I get it on the kindle HD. it is a cool game. basically your stranded on a island and your with creepers and skeletons, spiders, lions, pigs, sheep, and cow. you can mine different things. I think that it is fun for the whole family. it is a game that has some scary stuff but it's basically a game of life on a island. you can also play with other people. it will seem like playing with other people won't work at first but you have to be on th same server to play with other people.its awesome and watch out for creepers if you get it. it's totally worth $6.99.
B007SGM084|5.0|I read alot of the reviews from others who have read these books and was somewhat discourged from reading them. Nevertheless, I read them anyway and I Loved Them!!!!!! So I would suggest reading the trilogy and making up your own mind.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|This.is another great adventure by Lee his imagination really stuns me., I wish I had just a smidge of his talent it would be so unbelievable to be able to write these books. He is a great entertainer. I do have one Worry though I have  heard that There is a movie to be made called Reacher based on Lee Childs books and Tom Cruise is to star as Reacher, that would be an insult to the character that is supposed to be well over 6 feet tall and weighing around 200lbs in fact it would it would undo all the great work Lee has done to make his hero strong tough foe for any wrong doer to try to take down. Sorry to I had to end this review on a sour note but I really feel strongly about this subject (as you may have guessed) but I would love to see the Jack Reacher series made but with a more appropriate actor playing the staring role, the books are perfect for adapting into movies and I know a lot of other Lee Child fans who would flock to see them.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I am pretty new to weightlifting. Before about two weeks ago I hadn't spent much time in the gym. I would consider myself a healthy person. I eat clean and exercise regularly by biking and running. Now that I'm in my mid 30's I have to work even harder to stay the size I am used to. I recently decided that I wanted to change my body and get into really great shape. Thankfully I found this book before I got off on the wrong path. I probably would have spent hours in the gym doing the wrong things because I have a bit of an extreme personality. When I get into something I don't relent. This book confirmed a lot of my suspicions and really set me on a path to reach my goals. I have been eating and working out the way that Mike lays out in this book for about two weeks now and I am already seeing results. I'd certainly recommend this book to anyone looking to stop waisting time and to start seeing results. The author is clearly dedicated as well. I have emailed him a couple times and received very quick and helpful responses. The information in the book is more than worth the price of the digital version.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love it. it is awesome.  now when I need to know how much to tip my waiter I pull it out and put in my bill. you can even add bonus to the 18% it gives you. it also saves it. a calculator with memory awesome. then you can clear history when ever you want. I recommend it if you want percentiles and memory. awesome calculator.

B00000K0E5|4.0|\\"Goldeneye\\" was the first James Bond film of the post-Cold War era, which called for substantial thematic changes and an updated superspy. Pierce Brosnan finally took on the role, having been offered the Bond roles that eventually went to Timothy Dalton in the late 1980s, which he had been unable to accept due to contractual obligations to \\"Remington Steele\\". This made Brosnan a little old for the role by the time he got it, but there is some merit in introducing a new face for James Bond in the 1990s to coincide with other updates necessitated by a changing politics and social mores. \\"Goldeneye\\" is the first Bond film not based on the works of Ian Fleming. The film takes its name from Fleming's Jamaican estate, which was in turn named for an Allied intelligence operation in which the author participated during World War II.<br /><br />We enter the story mid-action, at a fictional chemical weapons facility in the USSR, as a man bungee-jumps from a very tall dam. This scene was filmed at the Contra Dam in Ticino, Switzerland, and the stunt broke a world record. Pierce Brosnan's \\"reveal\\" is distinctly odd for an action hero. We first see the new face of Bond upside-down in a toilet. While it implies that the new Bond will not be without humor, it may also leave the audience questioning 007's seriousness. Our introduction ends with a spectacular -and unbelievable- skydiving stunt. Then it's on to the iconic James Bond title sequence, which makes use of the female form, as is traditional. This time, the scantily clad ladies are destroying relics of communism with sledge hammers. This makes little sense until later in the film, but the symbolism of communism conquered, not by military force but by decadence, offended a number of active communist parties in the developing world.<br /><br />Now, nine years later, Bond is observing a racy former Soviet fighter pilot, Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen), in the South of France. Ms. Onatopp heads for Monte Carlo, where the French navy is demonstrating a helicopter prototype that is immune to electromagnetic interference. She steals it. Shortly after, the new M (Judi Dench) is alarmed when a Space Weapons Control Center in Severnaya, Russia, to which MI6 has tracked the helicopter, is destroyed by an electromagnetic pulse. It appears that a Cold War satellite weapon called \\"Goldeneye\\", that destroys anything with an electric circuit, has fallen into the wrong hands. M sends Bond to find Goldeneye, probably in the possession of the Janus arms syndicate. In the meantime, the sole survivor at Severnaya, a programmer named Natalya Simonova (Izabella Scorupco), doesn't know whom to trust.<br /><br />The Bond franchise has historically tapped into the world's current anxieties to find the appropriate villain. Failing that, it creates rogue syndicates of supervillains with abstruse agendas, which are less convincing. Although they are writ large, \\"Goldeneye\\"'s villains personify the fear of post-Soviet \\"loose nukes\\" or rogue military officers going into business for themselves. Xenia Onatopp and her associate General Ourumov (Gottfriend John) are rogue Soviet military trying to profit from their access. The head of Janus is a madman disillusioned by the end of the Cold War, having abandoned political causes in favor of personal profit. Of these three villains, Onatopp makes the strongest impression when she indulges her unusual tastes. As her name suggests, Onatopp is a spirited woman who loves a physical challenge. She's a literal femme fatale. Murder gives her sexual satisfaction.<br /><br />Attempting to ditch the damsels in distress, the writers changed the role of women in Bond's life -or at least their banter. Bond is still a man who enjoys fast cars, martinis, well-tailored suits, and beautiful women, who enjoy him in return. But the women of \\"Goldeneye\\" are more assertive and self-possessed than previous Bond films. The most obvious change is M, now a woman, perhaps inspired by Stella Rimington's directorship of MI5. Judi Dench's M is a strong personality, but we get only an introduction in a couple of early scenes. She calls Bond a \\"sexist, misogynist dinosaur, a relic of the Cold War.\\" It's a harsh and inaccurate assessment of Brosnan's Bond. She implies that the \\"Goldeneye\\" mission, like the film, might be an opportunity for Bond to prove his worth in the modern world. And he does. It is the villains who are relics of the Cold War, almost literally.<br /><br />Natalya Simonova is also a capable professional woman, a level 2 programmer at the Space Weapons Control Center, played by the lovely Swedish actress and pop star Izabella Scorupco.

B008RV5K4U|5.0|This film, in my opinion, is the finest adaptation DC has ever created from the original source material. It follows the original storyline quite faithfully. It is also the most violent of the Warner Premier animated stories to date. I will have a hard time waiting for part 2 but I do believe it will be worth the wait once it comes out early in 2013. This film was beautifully and skillfully made. Frank Miller's story is riveting and so is this animated film. If you were to purchase any animated WB film, let this and part 2 be that purchase. It's worth watching many times over.
B0098VXMNE|5.0|Love the whole series. The gore can get pretty amazing, and creative, and the sex is boarderline porn, but it completly works with the plot and not just as some shocking add on. The ins and outs of the story lines are amazing. Lucy Lawless deserved to win for this series! The last episode will make you want even more!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|What`s not to like, after it is Lee Child and Reacher.  Everyone that I have read have been good, some better than others but never anything but good.
B008AVYOBC|5.0|Bananarama were the original and definitive girl group in British pop music. Ok, they were never great singers like Labelle, nor were they show ponies like the Supremes, but Bananarama kicked the stable door down and took on the world.They were so cool and popular and they never tried too hard or took themselves too seriously, and they looked and sounded like girls from your local council estate. I was mainly interested in this CD/DVD career retrospective for the music videos, on DVD at last after so long, but the CD also is great, the hits sound better than ever! I personally would like to have seen \\"Waterloo\\" included, but all in all a great compilation, with liner notes from Sara and Keren.    [...]
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great series, amazon.com made it extremely easy to get the books, either  e books or hardcover whenever I wanted. Books are easy to read, but held your attention. Highly recommend.

B005COO1X6|2.0|Mildly interesting, but not up to King's usual depth of character and plot development.  Pretty sure it was written just to make a buck. Like a couple others I have bought for the Kindle, I was disappointed.  Why sell something like these short books to people who, in the end, feel like they have been ripped off.  I know I do.
B008RV5K5E|4.0|Gotham City is a city plagued by escalating violence and social apathy. Someone needs to strike back at the criminals, and reawaken the social consciousness. There is a rumbling in Bruce Wayne's soul... something that he's locked away is teeming to get out.<br /><br />The Graphic Novel, The Dark Knight Returns, by Frank Miller is quite possibly the greatest Batman story of all time. Fans have been begging for an adaptation since the mid-90s. Whatever the final product was, fans would hold it to the highest of standards. As a result, it becomes difficult to view the film and not see everything they left out.<br /><br />I knew they'd have to soften it a little, at his best Frank Miller's pen is like a sledgehammer, knocking the wind out of you every chance he gets. I knew they'd have to sand down that edge. If it was just going to be a direct translation of the book, why even make a movie, you can just read the book. I know these things. But the biggest flaw in the adaptation is they excised the narration from the book. I know Narration doesn't \\"work\\" in a visual medium, but by removing the narration completely, I really feel they cut out the heart and soul of the original work.<br /><br />The result is no matter how well the rest is executed, it feels a bit hollow.<br /><br />But, if you're part of the group that was never exposed to the source material, then you're going to see Batman like you've never seen him before. An old man dispensing vigilante justice, striking back at misguided youths, and wrestling the power away from corruption and giving it back to the people. The only work he's ever done.<br /><br />I'm not going to be critical of the voice cast. I'm not going to demand they cast Kevin Conroy in everything. Peter Weller is fine by me, and I like the girl from Modern Family as Carrie.<br /><br />I wanted to give this Blu-ray a 4.5 out of 5, but I'm disappointed in the special features.<br /><br />\\"Her Name Is Carrie... Her Role is Robin\\" - A 12-minute featurette about Carrie Kelly, the firs female Robin and other girl characters.<br /><br />\\"Batman and Me: The Bob Kane Story\\" - A 1-Hour Documentary about Bob Kane, creator of Batman, which was already included in Batman: Gotham Knight (which I already own).<br /><br />2 Episodes from Batman the Animated Series: Two-Face, part 1 and part 2. Which might be the only way to get theses episodes on Blu-ray for a long time.<br /><br />Sneak Peak at Batman: The Dark Knight Retuns (part 2). Still LOOKS good, and I can't wait to hear Michael Emerson as the joker. He really pulls off an Old Joker in the preview.<br /><br />A digital comic and trailers pad out the disk.<br /><br />No commentary and a documentary I already own. And they didn't get Frank Miller to appear anywhere at all. I don't hate the movie, but I stand by that it's missing the charm of the original. Every fan of Batman should watch this, but I wouldn't recommend buying it. Because the feature feels hollow and the special features don't save it, I give it overall 4-out-of-5. And if you haven't read the original book, you should consider buying it, if you liked the movie ([[ASIN:1563893428 Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]].
B0083SBM7Q|4.0|I absolutely love the movie, but am VERY upset that the description misled me into buying a product that I could not view. I looked very carefully at the table on Amazon detailing the features of the various versions of this movie before buying. Nothing, absolutely nothing, specified that you had to have Blu-ray player capabilities in order to view all the special features. So, those who have not bought into the Blu-ray fad, get screwed out of viewing the extra features that were advertised as part of the DVD package...
B0058VW36U|5.0|I'll make it brief, this game is totally worth the dollar I paid for it.  100+ little puzzles that are fun to solve. And the game loads quick so you can play for a few puzzles then quit out of it (great for the commute to and from work). Definitely recommend.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Excellent.  Very much enjoyed reading this book.  I didn't see anything that was inappropriate, just informative and interesting.  Looking forward to others like this one.  Maybe Robert Baer(?)'s CIA work.

B004FQKY5Q|4.0|This album shows growth in Per Gessle's song writing. While the songs still have an ample supply of strong hooks, this is by far Roxette's best album lyrically. Gessle's songs have always been catchy musically, but until now the lyrics haven't really had much to offer that you can't hear in millions of other pop songs. \\"Charm School\\" shows the kind of lyrical growth I've been hoping to see eventually from Roxette, and it makes these songs fuller, richer, and some of the band's best.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I really love this game. It is really an addictive game. I got the game yesterday and stayed up very lateplaying it l
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very well written and fun to read.  EL James created characters that were very easy to fall in love with.  It's hard to find books as easy to read as these.
B0092MKTL2|4.0|I am unfamiliar with the artist, but after seeing it on sale, reading the reviews, and listening to the samples I thought I'd give this a try.  I truly enjoy this album.  The music is written and performed in such a way I find emotive and relaxing.  This reminds me of some of my favorite 70's rock and 90's alternative and punk, specifically the genres such Moody Blues and Cure yet with the progressive rhythm of modern dance.

B008NW67E0|5.0|Having already heard about half the songs before this album was released I knew it would be good, but now that it is out I can't say that it is anyting less than flawless. Amazing lyrics that are both uplifting and reflective, amazing instrumentation backing the lyrics which are sung so sweetly at times you may feel like crying. I have to say though that what truly makes this album special is its use of dynamics, it rises and falls, it drags you in and makes you care, and the biggest crescendos are pure emotion. In short everything that makes music enjoyable to listen to, and then enjoyable to listen to again and again is in this album, I have no doubt this will be the best music released this year and strongly urge everyone to take a listen to it.

B008D19WBQ|1.0|Blu rays should contain more than a standard DVD not less.  That was the reason for its inception.  More storage as well as an HD picture.  This set costs more than any previous Friends release and yet contains less.  Its a no brainer, I will not be buying.  Re watch the DVD's and catch the previously broadcast episodes in HD on television.  To do otherwise would send the wrong signal to Warner Bros. and they will keep ripping the public off.  The boring excuse that \\"Real Fans\\" shouldn't mind is bogus.  You shouldn't have to cash in expectations of quality just because you're a fan of something.
034580404X|5.0|These books are written wonderfully. The story is very interesting and keeps you coming back. It's a lot different than I had expected. It opens your eyes to a whole other world and gives you insight to problems and lifestyles that you never imagined. There's a lot of sex but the storyline behind it is the real story and you just fall in love with these characters.It's well worth your time and money.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|I purchased this gun about a week ago and so far it's been great. It does require 4 AA's and some assembly, but that was fine. Assembly may not be completely strait forward however, I myself was hesitant at first to apply too much pressure to the plastic covers. After assembly, those things are not coming off. I am 14 years old, which you may think is a bit old for toy guns, but, well, there is a whole 'nother out there for older nerf enthusiasts.<br /><br />As for ammo capacity, the gun advertises 144 darts, but only 24 are included. It holds the 144 dart max capacity only with 8 18 dart magazines sold separately. I purchased 3 of those as well, and I am also using a 35 round drum I bought with my nerf raider. The new \\"elite\\" darts are much ore sturdy than there orange streamlined counterparts, which is worth the premium price for the new blue elites. They rarely fly unstable in a stock gun, and I can't say that about most any dart. The clip advance mechanism is handy, but feels quite rickety, especially with the drums and larger magazines. This is the reason for the 4 star durability rating.<br /><br />As for firing range, this gun takes the lead against most other nerf products. With flat ranges up to about 45' stock, and angled ranges that reach 70', this gun packs a punch. I purchased 4 TrustFire 3v batteries for this gun, and that kicks the range up to around 100' flat, which was the limit of my measuring tape. With the larger 3v batteries, the darts fishtail somewhat, but that is fixed by putting a small metal BB (I used silver) into the tip of the dart through the small whole in the rubber. (You will need a screwdriver.) with the weighted darts and higher powered batteries, only shoot this gun at people who will not care about the fact that with this configuration, the bullets hurt. I take out the high powered batteries when I am in nerf wars with people who I don't personally know closely, or I know will not care. Power wise, this gun gets 5 stars.<br /><br/>This gun is great for most older nerfers, but I probably would not recommend it to the very young audience, because this gun is very heavy, noisy, and the bullets can hurt younger audiences. Operation may be a hassle forests experienced users, but after a little bit of practice, this gun is very easy to use. It has a great modding potential as well. I give it 5 stars.
B005LAIHY0|2.0|First, I have no idea why Charlize Theron was even in the movie.  Her character was pointless.  The 3D cinematic was captivating at times but not enough to wow me. The movie had potential.  It was on the verge of being smart and philosophical but it did not fully deliver.  Alien and Aliens are far superior because they were unique, the action was better, and the story was not as cheesy.  Case and point (*this is sort of a SPOILER ALERT); don't assume a brand new species, or race, on a foreign planet is friendly.
B0099G3I96|5.0|It's sort of odd to see so many reviewers complaining about the changed sound, or that No Doubt is suddenly a sell out. Every time No Doubt comes out with a new album it has a much different sound, sprinkled with some familiarity.  It is very obvious that No Doubt does not like to stand still, they like to grow, and the different sounds of Tragic Kingdom, Return of Saturn and Rock Steady reflect that. To complain that it doesn't sound like the first album, or isn't as danceable as Rock Steady is the whole point! Why do the same thing over and over? The album is excellent, and shows growth within the band. Another perfect, fun and interesting album from my favorite modern band.
B000TERFS2|3.0|I have fond memories of owning this on vinyl and wearing them all out.<br />I am only giving this 3 stars b/c while the remasters are good, there are alternate versions of the songs from the original release.<br />Really takes me back to the bicentennial year.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|This is a truly spellbinding record, lyrically dark and funny, musically varied, and wonderfully produced. And the voice, as expressive as ever, changing with the songs and styles, is one of the strengths of Tempest. I realize that this might be considered controversial by some, but you know, not everything is for everybody. At 70 (his age when he recorded this collection), Bob Dylan is still a great singer, adapting his material to his voice, and his voice to his material.<br /><br />And what material! The songs are just incredible, the lyrics are superb, especially Pay In Blood, Narrow Way, Tin Angel, Long And Wasted Years, Early Roman Kings. A record for the ages.
B005APT8A8|5.0|The Byrds were not as popular as The Beatles, but their influence on popular music is just as important. Plenty of great Bob Dylan covers are to be found here as well as some of the greatest original songs of all time.  Who's heard songs such as, \\"Turn, Turn, Turn (To Everything There Is A Season)\\", \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\", \\"Feel A Whole Lot Better\\" or \\"Eight Miles High\\" and not had fond memories conjured up in their minds?  I can't think of anyone.  Sure, you could pick up the classic \\"Byrds' Greatest Hits\\" album or \\"The Essential Byrds\\" and be set with all the radio classics but, why not spring for the entire catalog.  It's cheaper than it's ever been and probably ever will be.  Eleven complete albums with bonus tracks for the price of four CDs.<br /><br />The boxset includes all eleven of the 1996 Columbia remasters with their related B-sides and bonus tracks:<br /><br />Mr. Tambourine Man (1965)<br />Turn, Turn, Turn (1965)<br />Fifth Dimension (1966)<br />Younger Than Yesterday (1967)<br />The Notorious Byrd Brothers (1968)<br />Sweetheart Of The Rodeo (1968) [Legacy Edition - with a second disc of Gram Parsons demos]<br />Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde (1969)<br />Ballad Of Easy Rider (1969)<br />Untitled (1970) [2 discs]<br />Byrdmaniax (1971)<br />Farther Along (1971)<br /><br />The only album not included is the 1973 album, \\"Byrds\\" because it was released on the Asylum record label.<br /><br />If you already own the 1996 CDs, you don't need this box.  The sound is exactly the same.  If it's a first time purchase,<br />it's definitely worth the money.
0385344333|2.0|My husband and I have read all the Jack Reacher books.  It's one of the few series that we pick up as soon as it comes out.  We have never been disappointed before, but I guess there's a first time for everything.<br />As others have stated in more detail, it's just a slow, plodding story that gives you nothing to pull you in, at least not for quite a while, and then not much.  If I had been new to the series, I never would have stuck with it after the first 30 pages or so.  I actually put it down and read another book that I found more interesting, then went back to it.  We didn't even like the action (finally!) at the end, in that it was just so unbelievable, with such a weak payoff.<br /><br />[Spoiler alert]<br /><br />Really??? really??  That's what it was about?  Gallons (?) of, what?  virtual money?  Huh? That's the payoff?<br />Didn't even make much sense.  And all those Govt agencies running around??  Give me a break.  What blather.<br />My husband and I don't often agree about things...  :-)  but we sure agreed that this book was a big disappointment!
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Much has already been written about the poor writing and the extraordinary amount of repetition so I won't include that in my review.  I bought FFG out of curiosity and read the other books in the trilogy online because I didn't want to waste any more money on it.  However that poses the question as to why I wanted to waste any more time on it.  And that's because despite the poor writing, the implausible plot and the annoying characters it's oddly compulsive.  I wanted to see how it ended and if it improved at all (it didn't, it got worse).  The book would have been improved immensely by a professional edit and condensing the trilogy into a single book as there's not enough substance for three.<br /><br />I don't recommend this book for anything other than satisfying a curiosity of how such a poorly written novel became a best seller. I suspect it's because it includes so many female fantasies - a rich boyfriend who buys you stuff, desires only you, a bad boy that only you can make good, a man who gives you earth shattering orgasms every 10 minutes (well, it seems like that) but doesn't require much in return (Anastasia is very passive in these sexual encounters.)  It's been so much better done elsewhere and that includes the erotica.  So I'm now in the middle of the most erotic novel ever written - Jane Eyre - the perfect antidote after the horror that is FSG and while there's no sex in it there's loads of sexual tension - something FFG ironically lacks.  What a shame that Anastasia, supposedly a student of nineteenth century English literature, didn't at least learn something of the skill of novel writing from her heroes when telling her own story.

I have always loved being active; skateboard, climbing, martial art, sea kayaking....but running? Running for me sounded straight forward and boring.<br /><br />\\"Born to run\\" is a well written book with a good story, but first of all it has changed my perception of running.

B004HO6HWA|3.0|The Mechanic (2011) is a remake that takes a few strands from a nearly forty-year old film, and then weaves them into a story that has little of the original flavor.  Directed by action specialist Simon West ([[ASIN:B000X418UO Con Air]], The Expendables 2), the focus is on flashy and spectacular action set pieces, and some mean spirited kills.<br /><br />When tough guy Charles Bronson played \\"hitman\\" Arthur Bishop in [[ASIN:B00006FDAP The Mechanic]] (1972), the paid assassin was still something that was relatively new and fresh.  So while not the greatest action flick around, the story was still of interest because it tread in a dark, mysterious, and forbidden areas.<br /><br />Today, the term \\"mechanic\\" is seldom used in this context, and any mystique regarding the paid assassin, has long since gone, as the hitman has become one of the most overused clich&eacute;s in the action genre.  Similarities to the Bronson version, which featured a killer with some eccentric habits, taking on a headstrong apprentice, are faintly present, but rather than taking a look at men living life on the \\"wild side\\", the remake is mostly about a master criminal's efforts to stay alive.<br /><br />Operating out of Louisiana, paid assassin Arthur Bishop (Statham) is troubled when he is given an assignment to kill his close friend Harry McKenna (Donald Sutherland).  Bishop has a conference with his boss Dean (Tony Goldwyn), who provides justification for why McKenna must die.  After Bishop completes the hit, Bishop encounters McKenna's son Steve (Ben Foster), who is looking to avenge his father's death.<br /><br />Bishop takes Steve under his wing, and begins training him as a \\"mechanic\\".  On his first job, McKenna demonstrates a stubborn streak that almost proves fatal.  Dean is not pleased that an unauthorized outsider is involved in company business, but Bishop and McKenna continue to work as a team.  After another dramatically untidy mission, Bishop discovers that Dean has lied to him, and that both he and Steve have been scheduled for termination.<br /><br />The story doesn't have much depth, but with some slick, well executed action scenes, The Mechanic probably provides what most action movie fans are seeking, with brutal fights, dramatic shootouts, frantic chases, and daring escapes presented with a mostly humorless tone.  This approach suits Jason Statham (Transporter films, Crank films, The Expendables films) well, as he plays Bishop as confident, dispassionate, and not given to much conversation.<br /><br />The new version of Steve McKenna, is a long way from the brash individual originally played by Jan-Michael Vincent.  Ben Foster ([[ASIN:B005LAIGLE Contraband]], [[ASIN:B000XRO3MQ 3:10 to Yuma]]) solidly delivers in the action scenes, but his character just doesn't seem to fit.  There was a 23 year age difference between Bronson and Vincent, and the teacher and student relationship played naturally there.  Although the 13 year span between Statham and Foster is significant, it just doesn't carry the same weight.<br /><br />In the original film, the third act was an assignment in Italy, which served as a coming of age for Steve, and elevated the movie from just a gritty crime drama set in southern California, to an international adventure.  The remake isn't quite so bold, but those targeted for elimination do help give the movie some color, especially a drug using religious leader.<br /><br />The way things play out at the finish makes no logical sense, but perhaps with an eye to the future, the film puts a new spin on the iconic ending featured in the Bronson original.  The Mechanic isn't a bad movie, but the days when a hired killer was a truly provocative subject, have long since past.  The return of Arthur Bishop while not unwelcome, may not have been really necessary.hat both he and Steve have been scheduled for termination.<br /><br />The story doesn't have much depth, but with some slick, well executed action scenes, The Mechanic probably provides what most action movie fans are seeking, with brutal fights, dramatic shootouts, frantic chases, and daring escapes presented with a mostly humorless tone.

B0018AO9A8|5.0|Just a very good album from Dire Straits, Telegraph Road is a great song, leading in to the depth of the album. I had this album years ago on cassette...(look at least I didn't say 8 track) Nice to hear it again...
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|Spectacular special effects, amazing battles and superbly creative looking characters. It really looked like you were on the planet Mars fighting the most incredible battles. It was one of the best film adaptations of a novel that I have ever seen. You see the visionary genius of Edgar Rice Burroughs using the effects of gravity & another planet on a person giving him incredible powers. This concept was later stolen in the 20th Century for Superman's story, explaining his Super Powers on Earth. George Lucas stole the entire Star Wars' galactic air battles from Edgar's stories as well. As movie fans you really need to watch & appreciate Edgar the Originator of many of the Sci-Fi concepts that we all have taken for granted as \\"Modern Originality\\". Edgar gave us Tarzan & John Carter, two of the greatest & most original stories of All Time. This was a very good movie, watch it!

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Ana Steele, once a quiet subdued college student plodding along with her mundane part-time job at the hardware store and occasionally meeting her friends for a drink at the local hangout----what happened to her? Her `roomie' got the flu and her life's  turned upside down when she fills in for her and goes on an interview for her college newspaper with one of the college benefactors.<br />She was so innocent.  Never dated, maybe kissed once or twice, but never deeply.  How did she get herself into such a situation?  Was it vulnerability?  Was it because her mother had more time for her many husbands than for her?  Was it her inferiority complex, especially living with a gorgeous blonde, rich roommate?  Will we ever know?<br />Anastasia (Ana) had male friends who were interested in dating her.  They were kept at a distance and not allowed to get close emotionally.  Living simple with her dear old VW Beetle, `Martha'  without the want for material things was the way she wanted it.  She borrowed a dress and shoes from Kate the roommate, to go to the interview.<br />I cannot even remember her major in college because of the drama that ensued within the covers of the book.  Needless to say her life's major had a drastic change.  The shaded Grey man molded and bent her into shapes most humans would never imagine.  His mind was so twisted on the inside and yet his body and appearance on the outside showed him a brilliant entrepreneur. \\"Shady\\" wined and dined the business moguls of the world and invested well.  He was also a philanthropist because of his squalid background, wanting to feed all of the poor in the universe.<br />Grey introduced Steele to Red.  Red being the room that he kept under lock and key. Things that went on behind that door.  Whatever possessed her to say yes? Christian (Steele) wanted a `yes' girl.  A girl/woman that would bend to his every word; better yet his command.  He didn't want to hear the word, `no.' What/who made him this way?  A handsome man; women swooned when they saw him.<br /> Ana didn't know she was the chosen one. And why, when there was a panacea of beautiful women out there waiting for him to crook his finger.  They would all gladly drop to their knees in front of him and do his bidding without question.<br />There is something that sparked from the start between the two of them; a fire that maybe shouldn't be started.  Because once started may not be able to be extinguished.  A read that definitely was boring after the first couple of chapters and will teach even the learned a thing or two.<br /><br />It has a good story line and that's why I kept going through all three books.  The sexual innuendos, however, repeated remarks like \\"biting her lower lip,\\" \\"rolling her eyes,\\" etc. got to be too much.  After awhile the sexual appetite became disgusting and I had to skim over most of it.<br />As I heard on her interview with Katie Kuric, she watched a lot of porn and researched a lot of material to come up with the sexual drama. In the last book, how could he do that to her when she was pregnant?  No wonder she lost the baby!
B0053O89K6|5.0|PLOT SPOILER ALERT!<br /><br />At last, finally a series that ends on a high note.<br /><br />There are more laughs in this season than the past three, and better story writing.<br /><br />It is a pleasant goodbye to House.
B00993FEUK|3.0|IF you've ever had the misfortune of stumbling over one of my reviews, you'd know what an animation geek I am, particularly stop-motion animation as well as anything scary.  I'm all for any film that pushes the art in order to preserve its existence in this CGI world of entertainment.  Laika Studio has been the standard bearer of feature film stop-motion since being contracted to work on \\"Corpse Bride\\" (2005), so I'm pretty much in favor of them making any film.  However and sadly, \\"ParaNorman\\" misses the mark on some key attributes.  Let me dismember the details.<br /><br />-HOW ABOUT THAT CREEPY STOP-MOTION?<br />I've always said that if you want something to look creepy, use stop-motion.  Not surprisingly, most recent stop-motion films have had dark and scary themes (\\"Corpse Bride\\", \\"Coralline\\").  Though Laika has yet to match the quality of their work in \\"Corpse Bride\\", they do a very good job of bringing their dolls to life.  They've also pioneered the melding of computer graphics with stop-motion to great effect.  This makes \\"ParaNorman\\" a visual treat that animation geeks can enjoy despite the other problems this film has.<br /><br />-BUILDING CHARACTER<br />Without listing the entire roster of characters, it should suffice to say that lack of good characters is not a problem for this film.  These are characters that are easy to identify with and to invest emotions in.  Despite the relatively large number of characters in \\"ParaNorman\\", they all are developed appropriately enough for their roles in the film.  Some of them I thought were great while others, though well developed, just didn't do much to excite me.  A well developed character will only count for so much if the story doesn't give them something interesting to do.<br /><br />-A STORY WITH GRAVE CONSEQUENCES<br />Unlike \\"Coraline\\", \\"ParaNorman\\" lacks a cohesive and riveting story.  The story often trailed off task or mood.  Sometimes the humor seemed out of context with events taking place.  Sometimes things got very serious when maybe they should have been lighter.  And all along I had this feeling that I'd seen most of this before.  In fact, \\"ParaNorman\\" was disappointingly unoriginal and derivative.  Kids who see dead people, misunderstood Zombies, and a mob of the living who does the misunderstanding are hardly fresh concepts.  To make matters worse, Laika really failed to decide on who its audience was going to be.  This is probably too scary for many young children yet not scary enough to satisfy older kids.  A Stop-motion kid film might not be the best place to discuss concepts of human sexuality either.  I think the fact that this has been a disappointment at the box office is testimony to that.  That's bad news for us stop-motion fans.<br /><br />-WILL THIS WITCH FLOAT?<br />It's hard for me to say bad things about a stop-motion feature film.  I'm such a huge fan of the art form.  That's why it was so disappointing to leave the theater with my family unsatisfied.  I loved a lot about this film.  Some moments were highly memorable and entertaining.  The animation was pretty darn good.  The subject matter was right up my alley.  But when you invest so much time and effort into an art form that stands on the brink of obsoleteness (heaven forbid!), shouldn't you take the time to get the story right?  Shouldn't you be just a little cognizant of who your audience is going to be?  I really was excited to see this film.  It saddens me that Laika kind of blew it.<br /><br />-Stop-motion..........4.5 stars<br />-Characters.............4.5 stars<br />-Story.......................2.5 stars<br />-Family friendly.....2.2 stars<br />Average...................3.4 starses things got very serious when maybe they should have been lighter.

B005LAJ1HW|3.0|PLOT SPOILER ALERT!<br /><br />If you like Greek tragedies, especially those by Euripides, you will like this second season.  It ends very dark.<br /><br />Everyone you like, is murdered.  Those who should have been killed, live.  And the one female you have been rooting for, betrays her man sexually, financially, and spiritually.  She becomes as despicable and disgusting as the gangsters.<br /><br />There is no one left in Boardwalk Empire that has morals, scruples, or is in the least bit likeable.  There is nothing uplifting in this second season, and with two of the major characters murdered, there is no reason to watch the third season.<br /><br />Just like a Greek tragedy, it is depressing.<br /><br />Three stars for the Oedipus Rex scene.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|Just got the Avengers 4 Disc Bluray.  LOVE the film, can't get enough of it. But sad to say I'm very dissappointed about the extras included.  Considering this film is the flagship of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, you only get a Joss Whedon commentary (very informative), a gag reel, deleted scenes and 2 VERY short featureettes.  I know all the characters have been dealt with in the previous releases, but here there's not even a featurette that could maybe have dealt with the history of the Avengers team itself (and such a rich history it is - since 1963).  Apparently on a UK version you can get at Sainsbury's supermarkets, there's a 90 minute Documentary on the rise of Marvel Studios. Even that would have been good. Again, LOVE the film (5 STARS) but very dissappointed with the extras....
B005MJAV1C|5.0|I gave this a 5 star rating.It is a great show and the scenes and piture was excellent.I enjoyed every minute of it.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This book starts out informational, but after I reached the mid section I couldn't put it down. A feel good book.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I like It because you can make your own little town and shoot animals. it is cool. get it now.<br />.
B004GYY714|5.0|With this excellent app that we purchased at Amazon, we can listen to radio stations all over the world.  Very clear reception.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|One of most craziest movies I have ever seen Tom Hardy is a surprised  good movie I would watch it again but need to go down to in price
B005LLSLPE|5.0|I never thought I would get into this show. I didn't start watching it until 1 week before the 5th season started. I saw it was on Netflix and was instantly hooked. When season 1-3 was completed on Netflix I had to order season 4. Thanks Amazon!
034580404X|5.0|I loved the story line 2 people trying to find out who they are. I read the trilogy 2 times I might have to read it again.
B009GEBBNQ|1.0|This isn't a review of the movie as far as the acting, directing, or story line goes. I'll let everyone else chime in on those. My complaint is with the sound. This was the first movie I streamed from Amazon in which I had to crank up the volume to near maximum just to hear the dialog. But then whenever the action started the volume was deafening. I really hope this isn't the start of a trend with releases of these or any other type of movies. I am absolutely happy to never buy or watch a 3D movie, and I will be just as happy to never buy or watch movies of this type if this sound quality becomes the norm. I'm sure some people have elaborate surround sound systems in their homes that might take advantage of this, or films like this, but for the rest of this I would call this unwatchable. Am I the only one that thinks this and the 3D crap coming out of Hollywood is not worth watching even if it were free. It feels as though I am since these things are becoming more and more prevalent. Sorry for getting off topic with the 3D stuff. I view them as similar issues, that being a disconect with what Hollywood thinks we want and what the majority of viewers actually do want.
B0063IH60K|5.0|works everytime a great app if ur bored and love solitaire easy to manuver I would def recommend to friends
B0015LBIZO|5.0|Brilliant,nice, expensive material box not just crappy cheap cardboard, everything is quality, however the packaging on the vinyls have been reported to be a tiny, tiny bit damaged on the top (as with my copy.)
B000002L6P|5.0|The softmore album that proved that Madonna was here to stay, and was and still is memorable.<br /><br />The first track that gave her the nickname 'Material Girl' never gets old.<br /><br />'Angel' shows that Madonna's voice can be so mysterious, seductive, and alluring.<br /><br />The title track speaks about being a virgin and comparing yourself to a virgin, even if you done something not related to sex.<br /><br />'Over and Over' stands a great message and encourages people and do what they must do without further delay.<br /><br />'Love Don't Live Here Anymore' and 'Shoo-Bee-Doo' are dramatic and tour-de-force ballads from Madge on the album.<br /><br />'Dress You Up' with its parables to dressing some up in your love like with that of actually dressing up is fun and unique song.<br /><br />'Pretender' speaks about what the type of guys Madonna doesn't want and tries her hardest to stay away from.<br /><br />'Stay' is a nice song (though I perferred the original demo verison).<br /><br />The dance mix verisons of 'Material Girl' and 'Like a Virigin' are good and fun to dance to, but so are the original verison on the album.<br /><br />Overall, the album is the album that made Madonna who she is and has proven to still b timeless and one of her most memorable albums of the 80s and of the late 20th century.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|Just started playing. It's alright just slow. I will play a little while longer to see how I feel about it in a week.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is a fun game to pass time but it is long without rewards. It would be more fun if there were quicker mini games
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Season 2 ramps up alot of the actual human drama within the group. Some have said that this season is so much slower and didn't have enough action. I saw Season 2 on air and then just watched it again on DVD. I don't really find it to be particularly slow. I really liked the interaction amongst the group. It's good to see people acting like actual people, and not like they turn into super-Rambo at the drop of a hat. The DVD Extras were interesting, but i don't think there were enough. Could have replaced the piece on the schmuck who scored the background sounds with something more insightful on the past of the actors and their interaction on set. Still, an amazing follow up to Season 1.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|Easily ranks within my top lists on favorites. I enjoyed the movie from beginning to end. Watching it is quite an entertaining experience.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|since the weather here in nc changes every hour it makes it easy to see how many layers should be worn before leaving home.
B00000K0EA|5.0|Now I saw where on reviewer said this movie was boring, and that he longed for the Roger Moore era Bond movies with  interesting characters. Question for that person, which interesting characters are you talking about. Because the only interesting character would be Jaws, Maybe Melina. Other than that Moore turned Bond into a Joke, he wasn't a cold killing MI6 agent. But thanks to Dalton and Brosnan, Bond is finally back. Now the story here is that Johnathan Pryce plays Elliot Carver, a news Mogul. Who is setting up a war between china and Great Britain, to increase the power of his media empire. Teri Hatcher, fresh off of Lois and Clark is Elliot's wife Paris Carver. A former lover of Bond's, and Bond's mission is to try to get to her to get to Carver. Unfortunately it gets Paris killed, Wai Lin played by Michelle Yeoh is Bond's chinese counterpart, they team up to stop carver's stealth boat. And then to stop carver, arguably the last great Bond movie, until Casino Royal. Brosnan is a great Bond, and he proves it here.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|was a great read.  i really enjoyed it and so did my kids.  i would recommend  it for everyone.   great
B001PPLIEG|1.0|Here's what I mean, Casino Royale was off the charts amaaaaaaaaaaaaaazing. I had even said when they were planning on this movie, get the same writers, and do a different story. But with the same attitude, and sadly enough. Qos came out, Now another syndrome that is out there, is the Bourne Syndrome. And this movie falls into that as well, We really don't get a Bond girl in this movie, as a matter of fact. When she does show up, she doesn't leave a lasting impression. And so she adds nothing to the story, the other Bond girl, who dies by being covered in oil. Doesn't add anything to the story either, and I'm sorry, But the plot is over Water. Really?!, trust me there is no shortage of water over there. There was no James Bond theme to this film, I would have had the ending be my Pre-title sequence. Then go into the titles, we didn't even get that. Or the gunbarrel moment, no this was Bond imitating Jason Bourne. And this sucks because of it, there is no memorable moment location, or Girl. I think Daniel Craig is good Bond, but this was not a good Bond Film.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is a fun game but it needs to give more coins when it is offline. The prides seem cool too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great experience! The Ebook format is very easy to read, wonderfull novel. It was a good decision to purchase after seeing the movie.
B003TJR2HS|3.0|No problem with the description of product or service receiving it. That was excellent. The item did not lock in place and therefore had disconnect issues. The item was not compatible with dock accessory. Had to return it.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Another Good book written by Lee Child. Well written and hard to put down, I love the Jack Reacher books and this is no exception. It is possibly not the best book he has written, but not bad.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I think this my favorite HOB story game yet! It was actually fairly scary too.  Wonderful job Big Fish!  Can't wait for the next one!
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|Some of the reviews on the Amazon site were confusing on this product -- very high or very low.  However, it has performed exactly as I had hoped.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|another out of the park, awesome lee child, jack reacher WINNER!! jack can do no wrong and he is so smart!!  the twists in this keep on and on ... cannot put this down!!
B004JLDSIC|5.0|I first heard Stacey Kent sing on a local AM Big Band/Nostalgia (!) radio station.  (Being a true music lover I do bounce up and down the radio dial.) I think it was a track from her recording of songs Fred Astaire had introduced/made popular.  Anyway, I loved her delivery of the lyrics and the fact that she doesn't sound like \\"every other singer.\\"<br /><br />When Stacey and Jim collaborate on the same disc it reminds me of Cleo Laine and John Dankworth - another pair of \\"instruments that never failed to please!\\"  Give THE LYRIC a listen, I think you'll like it too!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|play it on computer chaged my life Awesomest game in the world! by it please support mojang buy it. awesome app here get it one more block one more block one more block one more block one more block one more block one more block one more block!

B004A8ZWW4|5.0|Great movie, one to watch again and again. A movie the family can watch. I loved then relationship that developed between father and son
B005FISBTO|3.0|My hubby and I don't care to spend the money on subscribing to extra tv channels like show time and hbo.  So we wait until good tv shows are released on DVD to watch.  We have been hooked on dexter since season one.  So we eagerly wait for DVD release to \\"catch up\\".  We were beyond pissed when we were not only forced to watch a show time commercial. BUT also one with a spoiler to the ending of the very show we were watching!<br />We still watched the season because we were committed at that point. But I have to say this season was just okay.  They must have new writers because the characters and storyline has become cheesy and pretty predictable.  There were characters added and deleted without explanation. And dexters persona is very different and not in a good (bad) way?  I still haven't figured out the choice of Colin hanks in his role.  But I will give kudos to Mos in the reverend role.  He was superb!  And J Carpenter as Debra was off the hook this season!  Michael Hall is amazing as usual.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Great App, but I'm not okay with all the permissions it's now requesting.<br />Just show me the weather don't try to hijack my device
0679805273|5.0|I am buying this wonderful book for my daughter who is in 3rd grade.  I am going to have all of her teachers sign it up through High School (including K-2).  I am then going to give it to her as a high school graduation gift.  When she opens it she will have all her teachers signatures and some inspirational comments from them.  I want my girl to grow up to great things and Dr. Suess and good parenting are just the right mix.  (HoPeFuLlY!!)
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|The guys from Halfbrick seriously know how to put out high-quality, addicting games! Jetpack Joyride is one of those games you can easily pick up and have a tough time putting back down. Smooth graphics, lots of unlock-able content, and countless hours of fun!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|It gives a good estimate of battery life based on what you do.  It gives a status of battery health and time needed to fully recharge.  Overall this free app is very good.  The app has a modest size of several megs and does not work properly if transferred to SD card, which the app warns you if you do plan to put it on the SD card.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I like Jack Reacher and look forward to every story from Lee Child.  \\"A Wanted Man\\" is a great story; well researched and well written and edited. I appreciate the craftmanship evident in the developing the characters. While some of the situations may seem improbable, the characters are very believable.  I identify with Reacher and fantasize that I could live like that, if only I could escape my responsibilities.

B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Yet another great story by Ms. Austin. Although Pride and Prejudice will always be my favorite, Persuasion is a wonderful story of young love, heartbreak, pride, and reconciliation. Well worth the read!

B007GCY8FS|5.0|Unfortunately, I wait for each new entry in the Reacher series, and then I read them in a day. Reacher is among the elite heroes joined only by Joe Pike, Elvis Cole, Dave Robicheaux, Myron Bolitar, and Harry Bosch. No one measures up to these guys for entertaining reading.

B007ME5BUG|5.0|I thought I knew many of the details about World War II, but I know many more now! This book is good about separating events in the various theaters of the war into chapters, with discussion about both the popular thinking about causes and alternate views. We see how a change in the weather or a general with an old score to settle creates a scenario where hundreds or thousands of lives are lost--or saved. The brutality and insanity of war is presented in full, but also the humanitarian and heroic aspects of men and women. There are lessons here, especially about minor slights escalating into millions of casualties. There are several maps to help visualize some of the amazing battles, especially in N. Africa and the Eastern Front. Also included are many photographs which I had not seen before, an excellent selection of them. I would highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in history or world politics of the 20th century. It also gave me some insight into why my parent's generation, particularly my father, came to think about their lives and families the way they did.  World War II and the Great Depression affected absolutely everyone throughout the world, without exception, in an adverse way. Even those who were profiteers lost friends, relatives and loved ones. In many ways, it is miraculous that Fascism did not take direct control of the world--even if it still rears it's ugly head in many ways today.
B0053O89RY|5.0|This is another successful season just like the first two seasons. There were many hilarious episodes such as; \\"Send out the clowns,\\" (guest actress; Ellen Barkin), \\"Me jealous,\\" (guest actor; Greg Kinnear), \\"Hit and run,\\" and \\"Dude ranch.\\"<br /><br />Thanks to the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (ATAS) for the Emmy Awards for the show in the best comedy category, and to a well deserved Julie Bowen.  I think she is very funny and so is her onscreen husband Ty Burrell and step mother Sophia Vergara. Currently this is one of the best sitcoms on television, and I am looking forward to enjoying the fourth season.<br /><br />1. [[ASIN:B002JVWQSW Modern Family: The Complete First Season]]<br />2.

B007GCY8FS|3.0|Always fun, but not up there with the best of the series. Still,  interesting characters and nice moments, including Reacher taking on some two dozen gunmen, in a rather over convoluted and unbelievable plot. But then, believability is hardly the point of these guilty pleasure tales.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|Owen & Maurer have written an organized, readable, and candid tale of SEAL operations.<br />Most importantly, the book is the only first-hand account of what actually happened on the OBL raid. It's a must-read for that reason alone.<br />The OBL chapters are at the very end of the book. At first, I didn't like having to wait for the main subject. But the lead-up chapters were essential to truly grasp all the politics, emotions, & uncertainties surrounding the SEALS' greatest op.
B000Q7ZNDG|5.0|Kevin Branagh's Hamlet is a complete opposite from the Olivier film.  Branagh's Hamlet is heroic & dynamic, acting deliberately & with purpose.  The film also is a complete version of the play.  The sets, costumes, & music add much to the film.  The cast is magnificent!  Julie Christie, Derek Jacobi, Kate Winslet, Charlton Heston, & Jack Lemmon to name a few.  This is the definitive film version of Shakespeare's great masterwork.  A must see for anyone who loves Shakespeare and great epic movies.

1402270275|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! I was browsing at the bookstore late one night and picked it up on a whim because the cover was so intriguing. I'm a big fan of paranormal romance, so this looked interesting to me. I read the first chapter in the bookstore and knew without a doubt that book would be coming home with me. I was hooked from page 1 and could not stop reading it until the amazing conclusion. This novel is an incredible mash up of genres: \\"Oliver Twist\\" meets \\"My Fair Lady\\" (roles reversed) meets \\"Bladerunner\\" meets \\"Underworld.\\" The author is an absolute genious!<br /><br />On top of all the amazingly mashed up genres is a paranormal romance that is very satisfying - excellent character development, excellent relationship development, awesome sexual tension. Blade is a wonderfully hunky alpha male - the perfect \\"bad guy\\" hero. Honoria is a no-nonsense, practical woman who is smart and resourceful. The secondary characters are fantastic, especially Blade's band of mercenaries. The writing style, character development, plots and themes are all top-notch. I find it hard to believe this is Bec's debut novel -- it's way too well written and too well crafted to be a debut novel. She's definitely on my auto-buy list. I'm glad to know that the sequel is due out in May 2013. I'll definitely be watching for it.
B009B50QOU|5.0|Honesty, I like how they're not afraid to try different sounds with their music. I've always been a Green Day fan & I always will be regardless what they decide to do with their music. My favorite tracks are \\"Nuclear Family\\", \\"Let Yourself Go\\" & \\"Kill The DJ\\".
0596805527|5.0|I learned Javascript from the 3rd edition of this book, and never felt the need to pick up another book on Javascript.  However, although the language itself hasn't changed much in the ten years since I started using it, the features that it's used to support - like HTML5 - have changed so radically, I figured it was time to upgrade.<br /><br />This book takes the term \\"definitive\\" pretty seriously.  There's more than enough detail in here to implement Javascript (including the browser bindings), if you were so inclined.  The first 300 (!) pages or so are a detailed language reference - detailed enough that it could be used as a specification.  The author spends a lot of time going over corner cases and fairly advanced stuff that library builders might need, but typical users probably won't.  My only real significant criticism of this book is that this sort of \\"hyper-advanced\\" material is included inline with everything else; the author could easily have split all of this off into an \\"advanced material\\" chapter and the book would have flowed a lot better.  The other nit I might pick is that he refers back to functions developed in previous chapters (sometimes hundreds of pages ago) and although all of the functions that he refers to have labels, most of the other examples don't, so I had to spend quite a bit of time searching for the function he was referring back to.  If all of the examples had label numbers, it would take a lot less time to find a specific example by number.<br /><br />This book is nothing if not comprehensive, though.  Although it starts out with an incredibly detailed reference to the syntax, structure and behavior of the core Javascript language (irrespective of a web browser), this reference is followed by a discussion of client-side javascript; e.g. javascript in web browsers, which is probably where you'll most likely end up using it.  This section - about half the length of the book - talks about browser compatibility issues, historical APIs and newer APIs.  As of now, it's very up-to-date, including discussions of relatively new browsers like Chrome.  In this section, he covers all of the older browser APIs and the new ones (even a few that have been standardized but not yet implemented) like XmlHTTPRequest, Canvas, the File API, etc.  If you're looking for a book about Javascript, this is probably the stuff that you're looking for, and I wasn't disappointed.  There's even a whole chapter dedicated to jQuery - although this isn't the topic of the book, I found it to be better than O'Reilly's actual jQuery book.<br /><br />Be warned, though, that although this half of the book is mostly about manipulating HTML & CSS, he doesn't make any attempt to explain either - you'd better have a good handle on both if you want to get anything out of this section.  This also isn't a beginning programmer's book - make sure you have a good handle on fundamental programming concepts before you open this one.  Almost all of his examples in the first section are completely abstract (usually functions that real functions might want to invoke).  He covers object-oriented programming and functional programming techniques and expects that you already know what those are, why they're useful, and when you'd need them.<br /><br />The remainder of the book is a fairly exhaustive reference section.  This is the sort of thing you'd think you'd be able to find online, but can't.  I have to admit that I never found this section to be terribly useful in the previous edition, although it's been on my desk for almost a decade - Google gives me answers faster for specific syntax questions (and Chrome even has auto-complete nowadays).  I wonder, now that this book has gotten to 1100+ pages, if it might not be a good idea to split the reference section into its own book to save the reader's wrists.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|\\"Seek a door that has a 9 on it.\\" This one sentence is what will drive you to finish this game. You will get addicted to both the gameplay and story, and that is why this is one of the best games for DS period.<br /><br />You begin by waking up in a locked room. You have to find a way out by searching the room for various clues and useful items. Soon after, you meet up with 8 other individuals, and together, you must work to find that last door with a 9 on it.<br /><br />What I love about this is the story. It's actually pretty detailed and length in nature. Adding to that, there are 6 different endings you can get. This means that your decisions throughout the game play a pretty significant role and can change the course of the story. The only real downside to this is the text speed. The game designers kind of lock<br />you in and make you read every word of the story. While this lets things make sense in the long run, it takes probably 2-3x longer than it should to progress through levels.<br /><br />Graphically speaking, the game is pretty effective in pushing the DS's limits. The scenes look really vibrant and crisp, especially on a DSi XL system, and the videos use 3D animations, which give you the impression that you're playing on something a little more powerful like the PSP or 3DS.<br /><br />All things considered, I'd give this game a 9/10. Aside from the slow text speed (which becomes optional once you play through it once and go back), this game is a masterpiece. The sequel is coming out next month on 3DS and Vita, and I highly recommend you check that one out as well.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|This is an engrossing book. It's more of a mystery than other Reacher novels and it was quite a few pages before Jack broke someone's arm (irreparably) but to me it is one of the best and I've read them all.

B007GCY8FS|3.0|I admit I am an avid Lee Child reader, having started with The Killing Floor years ago, before he (or Reacher) became a household name. I've LOVED nearly every moment spent reading (or anticipating) his Reacher novels, UNTIL NOW. The premise of this novel was good, but aside from one or two scenes, this Reacher could be played by Tom Cruise on the big screen. Sad to say, this Reacher seemed diminished and decidedly UN-Reacher-like in nearly all aspects (exempting the smashing of the fat motel owner's nose perhaps and the end scene in the silo/bunker). Not the Hard Ass, tough guy Reacher we readers have come to know, love, respect and follow. I, for one (and judging from the reviews, not the only one) am disappointed.<br />In \\"A Wanted Man\\", Reacher is hitch-hiking on a bitterly cold night in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the country. Unbeknownst to Reacher, a murder has been committed just miles from where he stands, thumb out, on the interstate. The strange threesome that stop to pick him up are obviously tied into the murder, which takes Reacher a good while to figure out. Totally unlike Reacher's past behavior, he fails to act, which causes him to become involved with the FBI. Together, implausibly, with the female FBI agent, Reacher figures out most of what is going on. Unfortunately, the FBI, CIA, Homeland Security and all manner of secret agents are involved, which results in Reacher being sent to a secret motel installation where he is sequestered with the other folks involved in the under-cover FBI mission : FBI agents, eye-witness and Reacher. Naturally, he talks the other law enforcement women into breaking out of the secure facility in order to rescue the OTHER under-cover agent.<br />IF THIS SYNOPSIS SOUNDS CONVOLUTED, THE BOOK WILL NOT BE ANY CLEARER OR MORE PLAUSIBLE!<br />In the end, Reacher saves the under-cover agent and uncovers the grand scheme of a terrorist organization run by...well, in the interest of NOT spoiling the read for others, I shant name who it is.<br />I did enjoy the read, even if it became bogged down at several spots and was so far fetched with the convoluted roles of FBI agents and such. It was NOT vintage Reacher by any stretch of the imagination, nor was it a stretch to see Tom Cruise in THIS REACHER role...he just cannot play Jack Reacher from any other Lee Child story, especially since Reacher is 6'2+, big and described as a \\"gorilla\\". Not Tom Cruise--what were YOU thinking, Lee Child? I am astounded that he approved this casting and disappointed for all his fans.I shant name who it is.<br />I did enjoy the read, even if it became bogged down at several spots and was so far fetched with the convoluted roles of FBI agents and such.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|A down to earth account of a very important milestone in this countries fight against terrorism by real American heroes.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I think this may be the best Reacher novel yet. The cast of characters is small enough to manage, and the plot is deceptively simple, yet it's almost impossible to put down once you start. It's a good policy to avoid picking up hitchhikers on the highway, but as Jack Reacher learns, a hitchhiker also has to be very careful about whom he accepts a ride with. The ride may even wind up with unintended international implications, and could prove hazardous to your health...maybe even become life-threatening in unexpected ways.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We loved the first season so much we had to buy the 2nd - it doesn't disappoint and lives up to the first season.  That's what I was hoping for.  If you loved the first season, you should get the second!!

B000022TSW|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters when it first came out and damn did I love it.  Naturally I bought it on DVD years ago and watched it too many times probably.  Recently after having lost my original copy I bought it again.  If you haven't watched this in some time please please please get it and watch it again.  The one liners are as snappy as ever and the things the boys say are just priceless.  If you dont know this film has a ton of swears then you're living under a rock and dont need me to tell you how profane it is.  The songs are crisp and with and exception here or there for taste keep the plot moving pretty quickly.<br /><br />All I can say about this movie is watch it several times and let it get funnier each time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this trilogy prior to, and now after the first movie release. I loved it both times I read it and will most likely read it many more times to come. Quick, easy read that keeps the reader's attention. Well developed characters and plot make for an entertaining read!
B003O86FMW|1.0|In typical Hollywood fashion, Suzanne Collins created a schlock sequel to Hunger Games, an extremly innovative work. Catching Fire is basically a reiteration of the story in the same clumsy manner of another Rambo sequel. Another Arena episode - really Suzanne? Please!
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|When I first watch a new television show, I have a bad habit of watching the first episode or two and then forgetting to watch it again. After the first or second season, I'll catch it on DVD and go from there. Not with American Horror Story. The first episode sucked me in and I couldn't stop. My husband and I were exremely devoted, every single Wednesday night at 10PM, every week! I hoped the morning after, it would be a slow day at work so I could read peoples reviews and to see what everyone thought would happen next. I've never been this way with any show. You spent each episode wondering who was alive and who was dead. From the writing to the special effects, and actors, everything was brilliant. My husband and I cannot wait for Season 2. Even though Season 1 has nothing to do with Season 2, I have told everyone that Season 1 was too darn good NOT to see!

B0099G7KDQ|5.0|I had been eagerly anticipating this album since I first discovered Sigh No More a couple years ago and had seen the band live after that.  My fear was that the album couldn't possibly live up to the expectations they set with Sigh No More.  I was wrong.  This album, while similar, is definitely a progression -- not better or worse -- rather a step forward.  It's a little more confident and the music a little more mature.  I have listened to it non-stop for the past 24 hours, and each listen is better than the last.  Favorite song thus far is \\"Lover's Eyes\\".  Lyrically superb, great build ups, great story telling.  Just what you expect from this band.  But really all the songs are great.  If you liked Sigh No More, or simply like this style of Folky rock (or whatever name hipsters call it), you should buy this album.

B000XR4OC0|5.0|I recently acquired new Tom Shoes (Black). I purchased them for $49. If you are going to buy them buy them a half size bigger. The shoes have white souls and black fabric.<br /><br />  I like Toms Shoes because they are comfortable and have great support . They also look stylish on my feet. My mom loved them so much that she bought some for herself.<br /><br />  There is a problem with them, they smell when you take them off. So if you don't want them to smell put baby powder in them first. In the winter these shoes will keep your feet warm. these are great shoes. I love and enjoy them<br /><br />  I stepped in water and my shoes got really wet so i don't recommend doing that. They start to get really wet if you leave them out in the cold so don't do that.I think Toms Shoes are a great overall buy.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|Birders all ought to read this, for various and maybe conflicting reasons.  I am a birder and I loved the book and movie!  But it also shows us birders the way we can go wrong and become obssessed - though a good obssession, I think.  Well written book and a nice adaptation for the DVD.  Pleasant movie, no explosions, no violence, no cursing -- same for the book.  Since I ordered both from Amazon/used, I am not sure which I am reviewing here -- but give both the same rating and analysis.
B0069UP2PI|4.0|This movie was really good to me. I love movies like it... that involve the Center for Disease Control trying to contain and cure a new virus.

B008ER9QLK|5.0|I saw Die Walkure in the house, when they were filming the HD production, and the other 3 operas at my local movie theater in HD.  All were fantastic experiences, but having them home to watch over and over again is even better.  And just think, $119.99.  To compare, I bought the laserdisc  version of the Schenk Ring Cycle in 1994, at a cost of $335.00.  And I've enjoyed it many times.  And when I saw Die Walkure live, my ticket was around $300.00.  For just the one opera.  In the house, of course, you get better sound.  In the movie theater, you get great picture, but the sound of the orchestra is not always so full and rich.  But at home, on a widescreen HD television, with a surround sound system, you get great picture, with closeups, and amazing sound quality.    The bluray has DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and PCM Stereo.  Compared with my laserdisc version of the Schenk production, the sound here is much richer, much more enveloping, for both orchestra and singers.  The picture is 1080i HD, 16:9, which fills my 59 inch screen, and looks beautiful (the Schenk is SD, soft picture, 1.33:1, with black bars on the sides on my TV).  There are subtitles, which you can turn on or off, in English, German, French, Spanish and Chinese.  As others have pointed out the set includes four blurays, one for each opera, along with a fifth bluray of the film Wagner's Dream.  I watched this first, and it really explains the challenges of the production well.  Each opera disc contains a short booklet, listing the chapter stops and timings, an essay and the synopsis.  The discs themselves have some special features.  When I saw the broadcasts in the theaters, there were live cast interviews between the acts.  But by including these as special features, you can watch the opera uninterrupted, and then view the interviews later.  The Walkure disc has a short special on leitmotifs, with members of the horn section illustrating the themes, in closeup and stunning sound.    You've read all thepros and cons of the production. I for one, thought it was just right, a balance between traditionalist productions and crazy modern ones.  I loved the costumes, which are traditional, especially the Walkyries' costumes, which I thought were very flattering to the various builds of the nine ladies.  I thought the ring of fire scene in the Schenk production (which I also saw live) was more magical, but in general, the myriad imaginative uses of the machine were both technically impressive and wonderfully illustrative of the story.    As for the singing, unless one goes back and compares it to something like the Solti Ring, which was recorded over many years, with numerous outtakes, not in front of a live audience like this, it was magnificent.  In Rheingold, the cast is top notch throughout, from a lovely trio sound of the Rheinmaidens, to Eric Owens as a powerful Alberich, ably showing the frustration and later arrogance of the character, to Stephanie Blythe as Fricka, and Bryn Terfel as Wotan, his deep, lush, Wagnerian baritone showing why he is king of the Gods.  I also liked Adam Diegel in the small role of Froh, his clarion tenor showing promise for the future.  Wendy Bryn Harmer plays a fetching Freia in Rheingold.  She later is one of the Walkyries, and then Gutrune in Gotterdammerung.    In Die Walkure, Terfel really gets to show his credentials, both as a singer and an actor, and his performance is gripping.  Deborah Voigt, whom I have seen many times, is one of the finest filmed Brunhildes ever (not comparing to CD versions).  I agree with some that her voice is just a tad less amazing than it was in her 1993 Elektra broadcast, but she still has power to spare, a deep, rich sound, and excellent control throughout her range.  She also acts the part wonderfully.  I can imagine Birgit Nilsson, who of course had the greatest voice of all time for this role, costumed like this, with ultra closeups.  Well, maybe I shouldn't imagine that.  Eva-Maria Westbroek isan excellent Sieglinde, able to hit the highest notes without any strain, a large voice.  And then there is Jonas Kaufmann as Siegmund.  Wow.  What a voice.  He really makes this opera special.    Now I've watched Siegfried.  I love this opera, as it has tons of comedy, and a dramatic happy ending, things not always present in opera.  I am even more convinced than before that the Lepage production is a winner.  There are beautiful visual effects, such as a video \\"pond\\" with reflections of the live characters, a 3-D forest bird whose beak actually is triggered to the voice of the singer, and a stunning representation of the fiery top of the mountain where Siegfried wakes Brunnhilde.  I went back and looked at my dvd of the Chereau production in 1976 and the Met Otto Schenk production.  Compared to this new one, they both looked static, boring.  Costumes are also better, especially Erda, who comes from the Earth, and has a dress covered with what looks like pieces of shiny volcanic rock.  You really have to see it, and it matches her character.  As for singing, once again, it's excellent.  Terfel as the Wanderer is commanding, but now world weary.  Gerhard Siegel as Mime is excellent, a very strong voice (he used to sing Siegfrieds).  Jay Hunter Morris, the last minute replacement, has a fine voice, smooth and powerful.  I'm not sure he matches every Siegfried of the past, but he really looks heroic, and acts perfectly, starting as a naive foolish wild child, but gradually learning about love, women and destiny.  But Deborah Voigt, for me, is the star.  Her 35 minute love duet showcases a huge, full sound, torrents of notes flowing effortlessly over the orchestra to fill the hall.  Her acting is also spot on, and the chemistry between Brunnhilde and Siegfried is palpable.  This is one wonderful disc, which I'll watch over and over again.    One singer I haven't mentioned yet is Hans-Peter Konig, who plays Fafner, Hunding and Hagen over the course of the cycle.  He hasa thunderous deep bass, used to great effect in these villain roles.  Wendy Bryn Harmer, who was Freia and then one of the Valkyries, plays Gutrune in Gotterdammerung.  She looks and sounds beautiful, and acts her part well.  One of the best things about this 4th opera in the cycle is that it has a chorus.  And what a sound they make!  Their singing in Act 2 is thrilling, and like the rest of the set, sounded wonderful on my sound system.  In fact, the sound and picture are so good throughout, that alone makes this Ring Cycle a great buy.  The new uses of the machine continue to delight the eye and support the story.  Jay Hunter Morris has even more difficult acting here, and does an excellent job.  But once again, it's Deborah Voigt who really knocked my socks off.  She sounds truly heroic here, from the opening love scene with Siegfried, to the immolation scene, where she unleashes the full power and beauty of her voice.  The end of the opera is lovely and moving, the depiction of the Rhine echoing the beginning in Das Rheingold, bringing the entire cycle back to where it began.  I truly adored this bluray set, and recommend it highly.

B007DIQC90|5.0|Great vocals, lyrics, and musicianship.  I'm glad that this band is getting more airplay.  Fresh, original imagery and mythology. The sound and vocals are rich, unlike the pop playing on the radio that is autotuned to death.

B005LUJWBM|4.0|Could not stop reading the book !Which whilst travelling from Germany  to Australia was not a problem !Its tantalising and very well written
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|The only reason I bought this set was to try out the 3D feature on the new TV we have with a full Blu-Ray movie. I doubt I'll ever use the DVD version and the digital copy may get used once or twice if at all. The music download worked for me but in all honesty I don't see myself listening to the music in the future, it isn't exactly the most groundbreaking stuff out there. I do have to say that I was quite impressed with the overall quality of the Blu-Ray copy and 3D Blu-Ray copy, I just wish there was a way I could buy only those two copies without any of the other added things. Overall, the 3D version was very good. However, some of the fast paced moments were hard on my eyes and, at times, the picture did get a little hard to view (might have been because of my angle to the TV) but all the 3D movies I have seen have been like that. Kinda mad that the price for this thing has already dropped considerably. The list price of $50 is a absolute joke, at least I got it for around $30 as a pre-order...but now it is already down to $20. Wish I would have waited a day and bought it at the lower price because as good as this movie is I still don't think it's worth how much I was charged.

B004GUSG4M|4.0|Interesting....but at times it was hard to follow. It became convoluted toward the end of the book. The main character had authenticity due to our current culture. You definitely wanted to stay with the story.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is the most inspiring book I have read this man is a real class act he makes me proud to be an american
B006C3Q6GG|5.0|Excellent book!  I really don't know what I can say about this book that hasn't been said in most of the other reviews. If you're thinking of a book to read about this subject this is the book to read. Excellent  book!
B005S9EJ14|4.0|THIS IS THE TYPE OF FILM THAT IS SO DIFFERENT FROM THE MAJORITY OF RELEASES TODAY.  A LOVELY CHARACTER STUDY RATHER THAN ANIMATED CARTOONS & SPECIAL EFFECTS.  A WONDERFUL CAST WHO SELDOM DISAPPOINT.  I THINK EVERY CHARACTER OFFERED SOMETHING WE CAN ALL IDENTIFY WITH, EVEN IN A SMALL WAY.  A COMMENTARY ON LIFE AS IT IS AND IN SOME WAYS, WHAT WE HOPE IT WILL HAVE - OCCASIONAL HAPPY ENDINGS.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|The story is light and fun. Its not a book that will have you on the seat of your pants but if you're looking for a quick, light read, and you like witches without all the drama and violence of vampires, werewolves, and hanging then you'll enjoy it. I just started book 2 a couple of days ago.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a fun free game. My son loves it! He loves all of the obstacles and the fact that you can earn achievements.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I chose this rating because i couldnt put the book down! it had me so captivated and with every word i wanted know more. i dont read many books since post grad school and this one caught my strong attention!  i am suggesting this book to everyone i know that believes in our countries military and why we pay taxes to protect our freedom. freedom isnt cheep and all those men that were named thank you for your all ur work and commitment. ur lives are worth so much.  greeting all these names i couldnt help get all choked up and shed a tear of thanks. from my family to the family and friends lost in the epic struggle we all thank you.  god bless the U.S.A.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child delivers again in his latest novel. Jack Reacher is at his best in this fast paced story, it's impossible to put down.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|is as you would imagine.  simple carnival game.  at least now I can play for free.  if you want a game for all ages this one works.  my five year old likes it too.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I found this to be one of the best games yet. It takes visualization and strategy to draw the lines and connect or link all spaces.  very addictive...
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I enjoy playing this game, it is very entertaining .i would recommend it to anyone who like continuous action games.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Starts out simple and gets tricky as it progresses. A great free brain game for down time. I would definitely recommend it.
0525953728|5.0|This is the fist book I have read in over 10 years. As a retired SFC in the Army with a combat tour in Iraq in 2003 I knew I wanted to read the true details if this raid and not the spin from Washington, like they did with the Jessica Lynch story.<br /><br />WOW, I could not put the book down. Finished it in two days. I laughed at the tales of sleeping on the plane en route to the raid because to civilians they can not grasp that. But to those in combat we all know getting shut eye where ever and when ever is common, even en route to a raid..LOL...<br /><br />This book is full of combat details, and takes the reader on a journey that leaves you in AWE.<br /><br />To all Navy Seals, and SEAL TEAM 6 Thank You for your service, unselfish sacrifices and all that you do for your country! This story NEEDED to be told, and I for one am glad to have such men in our Military!  Semper Fi, OooRahhhh and HoooAhhhh  to you all!<br /><br />SFC Riley
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I'll begin by saying I'm a big Reacher fan and count the days every year til a new book is released. I liked this one, but it was definitely different. The plot was typically interesting and the characters were as well - Childs like to support Reacher with strong women and this book was no exception. What I found a bit odd was Reacher. Throughout the book I kept waiting for Jack to crack a few heads in his own deliberate style. And waited. And waited. Oh well, probably in the grand finale when he wraps up whatever is going on, I thought. But not really. Instead, Jack pretty much just shoots all the bad guys. The potential for hands-on physical menace, and it's use, that is so much a part of Reacher's persona - his essence really - was oddly lacking I thought. For all that occurred, perhaps with the exception of one brief scene, Jack could have been a normal-sized person. Seemed strange, particularly after finishing and reflecting back on what I'd just read. Being a cynic, it occurred to me that maybe Childs wanted to write a book that Tom Cruise could more easily slide into....who knows. In the end, well written, well plotted, and a good read. I just hope the genuine Jack Reacher reappears next year.
B001A3GSFW|5.0|I used to listen to this record all the time now my Son asked for it and how could I deny him good music in a world were everyone seems to listen to mainstream dance crap. Now I'm the proud mom of two little boys running around the house singing \\"Beat on the brat!\\" Much better for my tastes then \\"I got a party in my pants\\"
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is exactly like the coin game you find at fairs across the country with a few bonuses! Very addicting!! I was very happy to see this game. If you've played this game at a state or county fair and loved it...then this is an app you should get.
080214473X|3.0|I may be biased since I really like the movie version of this book - one of the better war movies in my opinion. I got to read the book much later. Usually movies are not good adaptations of books and omit too many details (e.g. Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings, or heaven forbid something by Dostoyevski). So why isn't it the case with this book?<br /><br />The author does a great job covering the battle in Mogadishu, and provides some view points from the Somalian side that you would not find in the movie. Also, there is extra detail about Mike Durant's capture which the movie skips. There is also extra detail about the communication styles and breakdowns in different units and the chain of command, which is also shown in the movie but not as clearly spelled out.<br /><br />However, the author has a very staccato writing style, and the way he jumps from one location to another is not nearly as fluid as in the movie. In fact, if you have not seen the movie, it would be hard to keep track of all the units and locations involved or piece together the time sequence, in my opinion. And he calls the elite army unit \\"the boys\\" so many times it gets annoying. That, or \\"commandos\\" which is also extra generic. It would have been more descriptive to call them \\"the guys with the plastic helmets\\" :)<br /><br />Another reason why I found the book less satisfying is that it did not answer some of the questions I always had, e.g. why are so many Somali civilians heavily armed, where did they get so much ammo, and why did they all turn out to fight the soldiers at every corner and from every window? And even more importantly, who were the people that needed to be apprehended in this operation and why was it worth the risk and eventual loss of life? I feel that the movie provided a tiny bit more background at the beginning about the disturbances in Somalia, but it also failed to answer these questions.<br /><br />I recommend the book to only history buffs and those who really likedthe movie and want a bit extra detail. Otherwise, I do not recommend this book - skip it in favor of the movie.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|hello this is an ok app but better cause it whoa your batter rate most of the time so you can see what takes up most of your battery add manage that.
B004EWFV9K|3.0|The story left me troubled. A slow moving novel I expected more than the character delivered. It is well written,just not a subject I could empathize with, Ill try another
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I can't believe I read this book.<br /><br />I'm blaming peer pressure.  And curiosity.  But you know what they say about curiosity, right?  Right.<br />I have to say, it took me three or four months to have the desire to read past chapter 1.  Okay, honestly, to even finish chapter one.<br /><br />I finally did it because someone I like and respect really LOVED it, and recommend that I give it a chance.<br /><br />I found the book boring and at some point found myself skipping over the 'hot sex scenes' to get to the dialogue.  Maybe I just wanted to get finished with it.  I don't know.  Sure the sex was OK, I guess, but I found myself wondering why Ana didn't smack Christian over the head with a frying pan and gtfo of there.  While the story was good, it wasn't really anything you can't find in a historical romance novel, albeit with more spanking.<br /><br />Usually, there are redeeming qualities in at least a few of the characters in the book.  In this book, I found everyone made me want to throw things.  It was like the stories I wrote about celebrities when I was a hormonal teenager.  And that's pretty sad.
0345803507|4.0|Very good book. You must get the trilogy and read all 3 books. They are very hard to put down once you start reading
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|The Disk has the regular version, and the extended version of the film. The extended adition is way better. It's way cool like I said in the tital. You get more of the story. You even get some details you can only guess at with the regualar version. The sound is very good. The only kind of missleading thing is the Dirrector's intro. This is because he tells you about what you'll see if you press play. It threw me off for a sec at least. Don't let it trick you you don't have to do any more. Just enjoy. I really loved it. From now on, the extended adition is what I'll watch.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is very addicting.  when you run out of coins you find yourself watching the clock.  great game awesome
1455502758|5.0|... which is to say, brilliant writing... penetrating insight... resulting in a thought provoking, little book that should be a must-read for anyone who ever had even a passing thought about cancer, suffering, dying and death.<br />Having said that -- and there's really nothing more to say about \\"Mortality\\" -- I can't resist commenting upon Mr. Hitchens' opinions on God, gods, religion and true believers.  Maybe he was right, and maybe he was wrong -- none of us will find out for certain until we die... but when it comes to human beings living their lives in accordance with well-reasoned integrity -- something I believe a Supreme Being (if there is one) would admire in us -- I've seen no one who did that better than Christopher Hitchens.<br />His death was a great loss to the world.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great book. Glad I took time to read all 3 books and not listen to the negative comments out there. No matter how great things are, negativity will always follow.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|How did garbage like this ever get on TV in the first place?  And once it did, how is possible that millions of people are entertained by it?<br />I mean, \\"The Sons of Anarchy\\" is nothing more than a glorification of a despicably violent, grimy American sub-culture that spits in the face of Mom, The Flag, and Apple Pie.<br />But I love it!  And am now counting the days (months... almost a year) until I get my hands on the DVD of Season Five.  Yeah, I know I can watch Season Five unfold right now, but I don't watch commercial TV... not even if I can record it and fast-forward through the ads.<br />But back to the \\"Sons.\\"  This is some great stuff, I'd say.  Character development, script writing. and plot twists that are off the charts.  Brilliant work!  On the level of \\"The Sopranos,\\" and maybe even beyond it.<br />So... all praise to the creators of this show!  It's a real piece of work.  Masterful in every way.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|OMG! I just love this book. E.L James you are now one of my favorite authors. I don't precieve the book like so many others have. I don't see it as an S&M book. ( I've read lots of those and none of them can hold a candle to this story line). If people look beyond to sex and see a trouble man with a trouble past falling in love with a naive girl they will actually enjoy the book more.
B00992CF6W|5.0|needs cave I like multiplayer cause it work with ipod easier controls better graphic when bigot it lager and didn't save but now work block story is old
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The third book in The Game Of Thrones series is hard to put down.  Much like the first 2.  A lot of unexpected things have happened but it never lags.<br />Lookng forward to HBO season 3.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I always look forward to reading Lee Child's books.  I've read every thing he has published.  A Wanted Man is very good.  Wish he could write faster.<br />Looking forward to his piece.

B003HYNB34|5.0|Matt smith is so geeky and wonderfully erratic that it is hard to remember the pain and angst  of the last four seasons. I was not a fan of Dr Who until the new season one came on. I was grown when the original was aired in the US and didn't have time for such things. Now I can see what the big deal was and thanks to  Amazon Prime, I am catching up on the early Doctors. Matt Smith is very much more a geek than the last two and he is thoroughly enjoyable. The energy he puts into the series is astounding and the adventures are so extravagant that each one sticks in the mind.It is amazing to me how strongly the memory of each re-generation remains while the current doctor is just that...The Doctor. I hope the BBC continues to make this series and that Amazon continues to buy the rights to carry it.
B001KVZ6HK|3.0|While The Avengers is one of the best movies of the year, the rating is for the DVD. I don't own a blue ray player yet but I got this set because it wound up being only $3.00 more than the regular DVD plus it has the digital copy and the music. I'm disappointed that most of the features are only on blue ray. I tried to download the music using the code provided in the box but it downloads as a zip file that can't be opened by either iTunes or Windows Media Player. You also are supposed to get a free poster but you have to pay $3.95 for shipping.
B0094KF4WG|4.0|This is a decent read, a good background about the author beforehand that shows previous deployments.<br />Though some of the details of the actual raid differ to 'Seal Target Geronimo' by Chuck Pfaffer. The meat of the raid if there, though small bits are different or missing which I find annoying, though this could be due to the fog of war
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|I was happy to see this at first because Nanco had developed the arcade version of Mario kart in Japan. Like pac man for aneroid this is nothing more than a half backed app trying to cash on a gaming Icon. pac man deserves better.

B0091IIP6S|3.0|The case I was sent, I didn't feel like it was legit. The instructions actually had spelling errors in them, just kinda weird I thought. I haven't brought my case to my sprint store yet but plan to so I know if it is the same as the Lifeproof Case's they sell.<br />As far as the case goes, cool concept, only problem is that you have to take the entire case off to be able to use the mp3 plug in or just to charge your phone. Kind if annoying to have to take it off for everything. . The spots that open/ come off for you to plug the power cord or mp3 cord into, there ARE openings with case on, just the case is so thick that the cords don't actually plug into your phone far enough to work with the case on.
B004UID2LC|2.0|The app was very good but noe every time I go to watch a video it say error the Internet is to slow. I upgraded the Internet and it still does this crape so wat r they going to do about.
B006AX6ONI|3.0|It was a very good book gave me a few insights on a how to think like a true business owner. Gives the reader belief that they can also achieve
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|I am not going to get this game, but I too often see developers rate their own games five stars (and that's wrong)  so I'm giving the game one star to offset that. Maybe the game is ok, or even fun but let 'real people' leave reviews, not the people who were involved with making the game.
0385344333|1.0|I have been a Jack Reacher fan from the start, but his latest book \\"a wanted man\\" was left wanting. A real disappointment after a long anticipated wait.
B0083B3KOQ|5.0|this app works great and I would tell anyone to buy it and I would show it to any of my friends or family
B008MG1E4A|3.0|I found that the book did not add much new information beyond what has already been available through news reports, 60 Minutes, etc. and was actually a little boring.
B001KVZ6HK|1.0|I liked this movie quite a lot at the theater. I pre-purchased this version of the movie because it has a digital download. I have a smartphone, a tablet, and a netbook. None of these has a dvd player or a bluray player in it. After waiting 3 months or so, the thing was finally released and I was anxious to watch it, only to find that the digital download requires you to use a dvd to verify your purchase and initiate download. This makes my entire purchase a waste of money. I now have to wait for torrents to be uploaded and get this the improper way. This was completely pointless.<br /><br />Edit: I got someone to download it for me and copy it onto my NAS, but when I try to watch it from my tablet it's all scrambled, and when I try to watch it from my netbook it's the same, unless I use windows media player, in which case it attempts to confirm that it belongs to me by asking me to put the dvd in the drive and opening the program. This is the most worthless useless ridiculous piece of marketing crap I've ever come across. What on earth is the point of this digital download??? It's basically just the dvd but with more complication and steps involved. DVD player still entirely utterly required, on every device you might want to watch it on.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great &quot;thinking &quot; game at the higher levels.  Don't let the first few levels lull you into thinking your a master.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Bravo to Mark Owen.  If anyone should be telling this story, it's someone who actually participated in the operation.  Loved his remarks about how difficult the White House makes it to actually execute these operations.  Imagine what better shape we would be in if that weren't true.  This supports my theory that whoever is President should let each department \\"head\\" do their job, especially the Military.  We have the greatest Military forces in the world and a lot of time their hands are tied by our \\"leaders\\".  I use this term loosely for Obama.  Whatever his faults or assets may be, leading this country is not one of them.  Thank God we do have some other great people (McRaven and the CIA stood out) in positions of power.  Also thank God that we do still have freedom of speech.  Anyone who liked this book should also watch the movie or read the book \\"2016 Obama's America).
B008J34466|5.0|Have been a fan for years and this album did not dissapoint. Yes there is swearing hence the Parental Advisory Explicit Content label! I love the mix of hard hitting mixes to her beautifully soft \\"Beam Me Up\\". Such a great every day album!
B008RV5K4U|3.0|I will start right off the bat (no pun intended) that I have never read the original adaption of the Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller, so the story in this movie is entirely new material to me. As a casual Batman fan, I have enjoyed many different stories and movies of the Batman from different decades. As far as film, I loved the Dark Knight Trilogy, Batman The Animated Series, Batman The Mask of the Phantasm and the latest DC Animated film Batman: Under the Red Hood, which was one of the BEST animated Batman films I've seen in a while. I've heard universally that \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" is one of the (if not THE) greatest batman story ever written, so making an animated film based on that story should not be surprising, but again I have never read the graphic novel so I can't compare and contrast between the film and novel. I am here merely to critique THIS film, and personally I wasn't as impressed as I was hoping to be. The Dark Knight Returns is part 1 of 2 movies of the great novel, and part 1 was a decent experience. I found the story to be quite intriguing from beginning to end and seeing what the characters such as Harvey Dent and Commissioner Gordon have been up to. Bruce Wayne has retired from the cape and cowl for about 10 years and in that time Gotham City has turned into a living hell, where the city has been overrun by a group of criminals called the Mutants committing all sorts of murders like it was nothing. Even crimes such as prostitution and molestation are shown in the movie, and I gotta say this is probably the darkest Batman film I've ever seen. I like the theme of the story, but the pace was very very bad. I feel that this movie could've easily been a 2 hour movie if done correctly, because the events in this movie do not flow as well as other movies with a 75 minute time limit do. I felt the movie was a bit rushed, especially in the beginning of the film. I don't know if the Novel depicted the story like this, but there was just too much going on that it was hard to follow for the first 10-20 minutes or so. Back stories of the Mutants was very vague; they didn't touch upon how the Mutants were established in the first place, especially the leader. The mutants purpose are simple, they follow the leader's orders because he is the biggest and strongest of the city, so naturally he takes over Gotham and corrupts the young and ignorant minds while the Batman is absent. It bothers me that this amount of violence has been occurrinng for so long, and it takes this this long for Bruce Wayne to come back, but once he does come back it's great.<br /><br />The voice acting was my primary hatred for the film. A lot of the voice acting lacked real human emotions or any urgency. I would say I liked about half of the voice acting, Peter Weller (Robocop) was decent as an older Bruce Wayne, but I felt that Kevin Conroy would've done a much better job if he reprised his role as THE voice acting Bat. Commisioner Gordan sounded whiny, but halfway through the movie his voice grew on me. The mutant's leader sounds like a generic villain thug you would expect to hear from any cartoon today. The Mutant Gang themselves sounded like punk kids, which they are, so it didn't bother me as much. The Newscasters were one of the voices that I completely despised, but I acknowledged their purpose. Some of the newscasters were sarcastic and implied some humor, but none of it connected with me. The voices I HATED THE MOST would have to be the voice of female Robin and the voice of the Joker (even though his appearance was short). I really wished Mark Hamill would have returned to do Joker, or even at least John DiMaggio from Under the Red Hood, but this new guy doesn't capture the menacing and twisted Joker I have grown to love. Ariel Winter as Robin....okay I guess my hatred for the character is deeper than just the voice, I guess I just hate everything about the character. I am not sexist in any way, I have no problem with Robin being a girl, but the way they portrayed her in the movie couldn't possibly be any worse. Her motivation to become Robin was forced terribly, there was no point in the movie where she expressed any interest in becoming Robin or helping innocent people, she kind of just became Robin on a whim. The scenario she was in during the film was she and a friend were jumped by the Mutants during the middle of the night, and Batman just so happened to be there and save them, however I didn't sense any urge to fight from Carrie's character during that moment, she just sorta stood there. So I guess she just got inspired to become Robin from there on after seeing what Batman did? Does it sound Stupid? Yes. In that logic, practically ANY KID saved from Batman can become Robin if they wanted to, and in this fictional world, I'm pretty sure there are plenty of Kids that have FAR more potential to become the next Robin. But allow me to continue...During the film, when she was transitioning to become Robin, she was jumping from building to building doing flips and complex aerial movements without any proper training or any background information that hinted she had the ability to do such things in the first place. Dick Grayson (the first Robin) was a gifted gymnast in the circus, Jason Todd (the 2nd Robin) was trained FIRST by Bruce Wayne himself so the physics of their abilities were justified, but Carrie Kelley was just RANDOM. If her character was better in the graphic novel, than I guess the producers just did a BAD job portraying her character in this movie.<br /><br />I have to give credit to the animation. I am not a big fan of American animation, especially DC's animation. Most of their films are so bland with barely any attention to details to characters or environment. While some of their flaws are still present in this movie, such as texture less buildings, I have to say that their animation team did a far better job with this film. Most of Batman's movements are smooth and believable, while some (punching through hard concrete and jumping from 10 story buildings without being hurt) leave a lot to be desired. The fight scenes are good for the most part, once again, if Batman has the ability to punch through concrete with ease, I don't see why it was so difficult to defeat ONE oversized mutant. I appreciated that they choreographed the fights  well, and Batman literally breaks every bone possible to someone at one point which was pretty awesome to watch.<br /><br />I don't know what is going to happen in Part 2, but I hope the writers and producers do a better job with the voice acting and pacing in the next movie. I still enjoyed Part 1 despite it's many many flaws, but if Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns is labeled as the greatest Batman story ever written, than this movie did a horrible job of convincing me. I have to wait for Part 2 to give my full opinion on that statement.ing a girl, but the way they portrayed her in the movie couldn't possibly be any worse.

B004QOB8SO|5.0|I loved this modern day Sherlock the moment I started watching the first episode of season one \\"The Study in Pink\\". With co-writers Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss and actors Benedict Cumberbatch ][Sherlock Holmes], Martin Freeman [John H. Watson], Rupert Graves [Greg Lestrade], and Mark Gatiss [as Mycroft Holmes] this is an amazing adapted series. I love watching this over and over.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app. it has become my new addiction. sometimes there are issues with it loading, but I'm still in love with it!
B004132HZS|5.0|BBC Sherlock is worth the money. I absolutely can't believe I hadn't heard of it when it first came out...then again I'm glad I learned of it when there was two seasons on dvd. Less time for me to fret over the next season :) Benedict, Rupert, Mark, and Martin are all completely amazing actors while Steven and Mark are amazing writers. Creating a modern day Sherlock and pulling from all the stories orginated by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle this series has done so well I can watch it over and over again; it's that good.
1781164150|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1PSMFKPTFL6SM]]This is a wonderful artbook filled with beautiful concept art. All 160 pages.<br /><br />When I first saw the movie trailer, I was really tickled by the monsters. Hotel Transylvania has certainly given not just a new life but also new looks to classic horror monsters.<br /><br />Majority of art are on the characters. The character designs are funny. Monsters that used to be scary now look comical. The fat Mummy, Werewolf in a shirt with short tie and a hydra with six dog heads are among the many monsters living in that resort hotel.<br /><br />It's amusing looking at the monsters and reading their stories. Each character comes with many cool variations. Kudos to Carter Goodrich, Annette Marnat, Carlos Grangel and other character designers for the wacky monsters.<br /><br />Much of the production design are of the castle interiors and props. Different areas and rooms are showed, like the library, kitchen, spa and steam rooms, etc. It It's enjoyable looking at the details that went into the furnishings to make this a cozy hotel.<br /><br />This is one of my favourite artbooks for 2012.<br /><br />Highly recommended to art and animation fans.<br /><br />(There are more pictures of the book on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)
B008RYN44U|5.0|After 11 years, and Rock Steady is one of my fav cd. This cd has the great reggae , pop, sound we have all come to love. Songs like Settle Down, Looking hott, Easy, Heaven, and Push and shove are well worth getting this cd. The only songs I dont care for are Under cover and Undone, they really dont work with all the rest of the songs. I think Looking Hott and Easy should be the singles from this cd. After all these years, this band still has it.  I love it. I am a fan.Oh yes, Dreaming the same dream...great song. So many top 10 hits.Just have to add Easy should be the next single, but it needs to be shorter for a single. PUT IT OUT AS A Single. its gold.
B0074EIQQU|5.0|I bought this cd for my husband.. He told me that is great, but different from the others. I did<br />Not listen the cd yet..
B001BWYTAS|1.0|if i could give this video less than one star i would have. i unknowingly purchased this video for my husband as part of a special BEATLES birthday gift along with other beatles movies and a 'beatles' encyclopedia. this DVD was the biggest waste of money i have ever spent. it is nothing more than 90 minutes of depressing interviews with people barely involved in the making of MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR who have nothing of any importance to say. even our children, who have been to liverpool and sung on the stage of the 'new' cavern and are die-heart beatles fans, begged us to 'turn it off!' i'm not even wasting money to return it. we feel it is a sad and desperate way to steal money from die-hard fans like us.
B0084RSYEK|2.0|What has happened to Eddie Murphy!!!!!! Pretty okay concept and story line but the jokes were not funny. Cliched jokes with cliched storyline. I found myself getting bored and just wanted it to end. Eddie Murphy, please pick better roles with some original comedic material.
B0053JJLLC|4.0|** spoiler alert **  I just like Michael Crichton. This book did not disappoint! A half-dozen graduate students in scientific fields disappear when they go to be interviewed. This happens because the guy in charge has reduced them to a half-inch tall. They encounter things like huge ants and beat them up. The students' brains are still highly functioning despite their small size.<br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT***<br />The little guys overcome the big guys eventually, but enough of the little guys die that you feel sorry for them. I like a nice ending
B0095R64AO|4.0|KInda cute! Some funny stuff. Felt it got a bit too serious in some places. But overall, a pretty decent relationship movie. Not cliched. For a change the man gives up his dreams for the woman!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Chris Kyle proves himself as more than just a SEAL and a legendary marksman in this work of literature. I was incredibly impressed with how well he was able to put the reader into the situations he was encountering. Though we aren't able to fully understand the stressfulness he was experiencing it gave you a little bit of a feel of how the war was truly playing out. I think this book is a one of a kind look into the life of a man that served his country with all the pride one could hope, and by chance of skill and being in the right place at the right time, has become the legendary military sniper we now know him as. Thank you to him for sharing this story with the world. It is a piece of art.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this app and have been playing it for awhile now. One thing I would change: when u buy something with your acorns i think there needs to be a confirm or cancel option since they r so rare to come by unless u buy them, especially when u hit something by accident to buy with ur acorns. Otherwise, love the game!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This was not my typical autobiography as normally war and military life is not things I am interested in, however given the main subject of this book, the killing of Osama Bin Ladin. It was a piece of history that needed to be told..I think everyone should read it, I am not proud of a fella human being being killed but considering all the lives he has caused to be snuffed out, I am glad he is not in a prison somewhere watching t.v., eating fine meals & planning more horror for the U. S. It was a job that had to be done & I admire the Navy Seals and all the military people who lay their lives on the line continually. I guess it is a special calling..It is an easy book to read even though it is a lot of military stuff...
030758836X|3.0|No doubt that this is a very well written book.  With that said, you are going to need a score card and a some patience.  It was a page turner, but I found myself turning the pages back so I could keep from getting lost.  Not the style of writing that I'm used to so I put myself at some fault for not enjoying it as much. Not a bad one to have on the shelf though, entertaining to say the least.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I enjoy this game but at times it gets a bit slow. but I recommend it. I wish it would take a little less to charge items.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Lee Child basically continues the three book series that began with 61 Hours and continued with Worth Dying For. This third in the mini-series takes place as Reacher is moving back in the direction of Virginia and details the mystery when he is picked up while hitchhiking as a ruse to hide the men who committed a crime in plain sight. With a busted nose, we see the endurance of a character that has never really been seriously injured. He has a mild shift in personality in this book that looks as if it results from this new injury. That said, Jack Reacher is the same, lovable goofball that will stomp the crap out of you with his Columbo-like observations and get the job done at whatever the cost so he can return to invisibility once again. As with the last two books, it looks as if Reacher is getting a bit crotchity in his middle age. He doesn't seem to have the desire to let the law handle it, as if he is in a rush towards destiny or something. I love these Reacher novels by Lee Child and just have the most difficult time finding super quality books of this genre to read while awaiting his next missive. Keep it up Lee.
B001HBYH9Q|5.0|Hugh Grant at his sweetest.  This movie never fails to charm me and I would think it's a good insight into the life of \\"movie stars.\\"<br />I also love all the wacky co-stars who add color to every scene.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I fell in love with it after watching the movie on the plane.  Bought both the Blu-ray disc and the books.
B0083SBJXS|2.0|When one purchases a Blu Ray, one expects to get some extra bang for the buck.<br /><br />I was waiting to see how many of the visual effects were created.  I was specifically interested in Mark Ruffalo's work on the Hulk Mo-Capture.<br /><br />The Blu Ray has a bare bones feature on the visual journey, but gives very little detail.<br /><br />For all of the hype of the release, I expected more.<br /><br />Five Stars for the movie 2 for the treatment on Blu Ray.<br /><br />One Day Later.......<br /><br />I purchased the Target release of the Blu Ray.<br /><br />It contains a Bonus disk with a 90min behind the scenes feature called \\"Creating a Cinematic Universe\\"<br /><br />While it doesn't make up for the lack of technical behind the scenes features on the main disk, I suppose it is better than nothing.<br /><br />It also did not cost any extra.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a simple game that still requires some thinking for some initial positions. Time trial mode puts some more excitement into it. I am teaching my daughter colors with it, she calls them snakes and enjoys drawing long colorful f<br />paths. Great free game.
B005NPLXJ4|5.0|Lulu has actually grown on me. On first listen, I thought it was the worst thing I had ever heard, but now I have a different feeling. Reed and Metallica are the perfect match. From the opening acoustic riffs in \\"Brandenburg Gate\\" to the closing of \\"Junior Dad\\", this album is an 87 minute epic. For the new \\"Loutallica\\", hats off to ya!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is unlike most of the personal accounts written by former Navy Seals in that it is very well written and does not devote an inordinate amount of space to the tribulations of Seal training (BUDS) or how and why they became so single minded in their unwillingness to quit or be beaten.  Instead the authors concentrate on the difficult missions and deprivations endured to accomplish each mission.  The reader, if like me, will read in quiet awe of these special men and their professionalism and what they endure to keep our country safer.<br /><br />The book is fast paced and moves from one mission to the next culminating with the ultimate mission of bringing down OBL. That alone is worth  the price of the book.  It is interesting to a fault.<br /><br />When I finished the book, a line from the movie \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\" came to mind:  \\"Who are those guys.\\"  Thank God they are on our side.
B000002H2H|4.0|Ride the Lightning is Metallica second strongest album. This album has some of Metallica's best songs. This is the album for new Metallica fans. My personal recommendations include, \\"Ride The Lightning\\", \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\", \\"Fade to Black', and \\"Escape\\". A must have for Metallica fans.
B007JRU2UK|4.0|Nice movie. Not an action movie and it is filled with dialogue and feelings. Acting was good and the story wasn't bad either.
B000002H33|5.0|Metallica's Master Of Puppets is their highest standpoint. It is the last with bassist Cliff Burton, who died in a bus accident on the Puppets tour. Every song on this album is superb. Personal favorites include \\"Battery\\", \\"Leper Messiah\\", \\"Disposable Heroes\\", and \\"Orion\\". A must have for all metal fans.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It is a love story but also a book with a suspense.<br />I bought the book for a friend on her Kindle<br />I have read all 3 books and enjoyed the suspense of all 3 .<br />For my friend I will soon load the next book
B004UID2LC|1.0|This app compliments YouTube and adds the highly desirable video download feature. However, after maybe a year of using it happily it stopped working about couple of weeks ago (not sure if there was an update that broke it or maybe YouTube changed something that broke it). The app comes up, let's you search songs but would not download them! So what's the point of this app?
B008LSVL6U|5.0|My family and I had the pleasure to witness the April 9th show in Dallas, TX (4 days prior to the filming of this production)... hands down one of the BEST live music experiences of my life. In this age of gargantuan, 1,000 megawatt, flashy stage productions, Steven and his band manage to overpower all the visual eye-candy with pure talent and emotion. Excellent production from film-maker and photographer, Lasse Hoile, the beautiful quality of this high-definition blu-ray made me feel like I was there again... simply amazing!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Jack Reacher is a giant among men and Lee Child is a giant among writiers.<br />I read elsewhere that Lee Child is only planning 21 Reacher novels.  This information is one of the biggest disappointments I have had in a long time.<br />Reacher has lots to do and much the USA has not been travelled.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|As an aspiring culinarian, I look up to the rough necks of the biz. Anthony Bourdain is an amazing Chef and I,love his speaking style. He writes the same way. Great descriptions of food, scenes, scents, and experiences. <br /><br />I love that he touches on all the bases. The good, the bad, the amazingly great and the 'I don't even believe what I'm reading' bad. <br /><br />He makes me fall in love with the industry and want to run for the hills all at once. <br /><br />Great history of his career and NY restaurants.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|A \\"page turner\\" for sure...can't put it down!  I have read all the \\"Reacher\\" novels and this is the best one.  Lee Child is a genius.
0711225176|5.0|Bought the book as a birthday present, and sent it directly out of state, so cannot personally attest to it. But have received numerous phone calls, and a thank you card, so I'm assuming it was well received by somebody who has long been a fan of mucha.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I really enjoy these kinds of games and this one was well worth the $2. there were a few times that I got stuck and had to use the hint but it wasn't overly hard. cant wait for the second one.
B0054W4JQK|5.0|Although an unfamiliar author to me, I wanted to read it as it was recommended by Tess Gerritsen who writes amazing books. I found this book easy to read. It gave you an insight to what it must be like to have no long-lasting memories. Right through the book, I figured there must be a twist which indeed there was, one that I was not expecting. I enjoyed this book right through to the end and I look forward to any future books written by S.J Watson.
B00881VLCE|2.0|This is an entertaining past time-if you like jigsaw puzzles.  However--some puzzles won't download and some puzzles cause all your puzzles to disappear...VERY frustrating.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was so hard to put down. The way it is written through letters to an anonymous person makes it personal. It shows insight into the mind of Charlie. The way that Charlie becalmed friends with Sam and Patrick and then they support each other is touching. I love this book! Recommend it to almost anyone!(:
B0094OLFUW|4.0|Had a lot of good songs, but some were very boring. Overall, I liked the album. Carrot ball every moon farm. Eat album covers until you drop. Sorry, I need 20 words in my review.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|While I cannot say that this newest DC Animated Feature is the most canonical, I can say it is the one I have enjoyed most so far, to date. From the moment I heard that Peter Weller would voice Batman/Bruce Wayne, I had very high hopes. The main characters are fairly flawless, though I expect this new Robin (yes, the girl), will be featured a little more in the next volume, due out apparently this winter. It's not a disappointment - it leaves us wanted to watch Part Two RIGHT THEN. Flawless execution.<br /><br />The special features are not up to par. Other reviewers have cited the fact that this graphic novel CHANGED the way we read the Batman comics forever. It's not just a tagline, it's truth. So I have to agree that I would love to see a few retrospectives on this sparking bit of social commentary. Maybe it'll get released with the next volume.<br /><br />And most surprisingly, we see a 'sneak peak' into the 'up-coming' Superman/Batman \\"Public Enemies. Really? Didn't that come out like two year's ago?<br /><br />Despite the ball being fumbled behind the scenes, the feature it self is breath-taking, shocking, and awesome. If you've read some of my other DC reviews, you know that I always espouse a Flash or Swamp Thing, or Martian Manhunter... anything for one of the million other great characters that DC can draw upon.<br /><br />Right now, the only thing I can hope for is the release date of Dark Knight Returns: Part Two.

B0083SBJXS|5.0|It is an impossibility to have access to the modern media-centric world and not know about a hugely successful film that is called the Avengers. Not only was it one of the most successful films of all time, gaining money hand over fist for one reason or another, but it was actually a film made for the fans, by one of the biggest fans, one Joss Whedon. A man who has a horde of fans so devoted, they would have watched the Avengers if it had starred Muppets. The movie is in every way a creation of genius and love of source material.<br /><br />/rant<br />And that is where the buck stops. Jarringly so.<br /><br />For extras, we get two featurettes, a hand full of deleted scenes which by all rights should NOT have been deleted, and a very dry commentary track from someone this reviewer came to think could talk about drying wallpaper and make it interesting. Not so. I am left with the feeling that Disney said to Joss \\"Now, we know you're good, and you're name may be a huge point to this film's success, but you absolutely cannot mention Firefly, Serenity, or Dollhouse. OH! Here's you commentary script, too.\\"<br /><br />Don't buy a shinier version for expected extras. Buy it on DVD. If you were thinking of getting a BD player any time in the future, BUY IT NOW and then make this film the first BD that you watch. Make no mistake - this film has changed the way franchise films should be produced. We are just left, hands wavering in waiting, wanting the tidbits of extras we figured we'd get on such a huge production./rant<br /><br />Oh, yeah! The Avengers film DID kick @$$. I did say that already, yes?
B0087HT36U|5.0|This is an awesome game. It's fun and it's challenging and addictive. Its a game that keeps you on you toes
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I won't bother to describe what this book is about since so many  other reviews have already described it so nicely. But I will say that I could not put this book down.  I love stories about time travel and this book did not disappoint.  The story just came to life for me. I felt as if I were right there with Jake/George living in the late fifties, early sixties.  I would highly recommend this book.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|I had to fight with this cord to get it to connect to my kindle fire. don't buy it, it's not worth the stress. Let alone the fact that it literally took exactly ONE MONTH to get to me.
B004SIPA4G|4.0|The film is great and looks awesome in HD, this goes without saying. What's even better is the additional footage and Behind-the-scenes documentaries that come with. They even included a whole other cut of the movie with the stories placed in the order of the comics plus additional scenes that were cut for timing. A really cool addition.

B003UMW69I|3.0|With a very good cast (Sandra Bullock as a demanding boss, Ryan Reynolds as her long-suffering right-hand man, Mary Steenbergen as his mom, Craig Nelson as his dad, Betty White as his grandma)this romantic comedy delivers few surprises and no uproarious laughs, but decent acting.<br /><br />It starts in NYC where Reynolds is pursuing his true love: writing (or is it editing? or both? Who cares).  The plot contrives to throw both of them on a sudden vacation to his family home in Alaska where they must pretend to be engaged and naturally, being a romantic comedy, they have to move from pretending to realizing...<br /><br />It's cute enough and if you want a plesant movie with an upbeat ending that does not require much thinking and is rather family friendly (it's pretty mild compared to some PG-13) this should be your cup of tea.  Or make that a hot coffee (It's Alaska after all)
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I didn't know what to expect going into this book. Everyone was raving about it, and there's even a movie about it. So I thought, why not give it a try?!<br /><br />Well, I'm happy to say that Perks of Being a Wallflower was a refreshing surprise. I really enjoyed reading this one and although it's very different from what I usually read, it was in a good way. I wasn't engrossed or didn't consider it a page-turner in any way, but it was very captivating and easily something that people can relate to in one way or the other.<br /><br />The Perks of Being a Wallflower is told from 15 year old Charlie's perspective, through his writing letters to \\"his friend\\", which is basically the reader. The book is pretty short and I liked how there were barely any dull or fluff moments, so I finished it fairly quickly. Anyways, Charlie basically writes about his thoughts on being a teenager, spending time with his friends, and his relationship with his family, friends, and school; particularly his English teacher who assigns him a variety of classics to read, which I thought was a nice touch because it gets you curious about it if you haven't read any of them before, and if you have, it kind of makes you want to revisit them again. Charlie deals with all the typical trials and tribulations of being a teenager, like love and his views on that and so many other things is so simple, yet genuine. I liked that he wasn't jaded or rude like a lot of teens are today; he just seemed so pure and innocent, even though he does some things that are hardly that.<br /><br />The other characters were pretty interesting too, especially his family. Probably the one that sticks out to me the most is his sister, who he has the most interaction with and who does some pretty crazy stuff, but is also kind of typical for some teenage girls. Charlie's friends are fun and endearing. Patrick and Sam are excellent characters with vibrant personalities and it was interesting seeing their mixed group and all the things they went through.<br /><br />There are definitely a few sad and depressing moments throughout the book, but the melancholy undertone didn't deter me away from the book at all and there a few happy moments scattered about too. Not to mention the surprise ending I didn't see coming. The writing is very poignant and well-written, creative and compelling, to say the least. A very short and sweet tale of life through the eyes of a shy, naive teenager that you'll thoroughly take pleasure in and one you won't easily forget.he things they went through.<br /><br />There are definitely a few sad and depressing moments throughout the book, but the melancholy undertone didn't deter me away from the book at all and there a few happy moments scattered about too.

B005LAIIQC|4.0|\\"The Bourne Legacy\\" doesn't really break much new ground in terms of what fans have come to expect from the gritty, violent trilogy of films that preceeded it, but it's still an entertaining diversion. It's a testament to Tony Gilroy's screenwriting savvy, as well as the acting skills of the superb cast, that, although much of the material is familiar and doesn't really deviate from the structure of the preceding films, it's still fun watching a new spy (well-played by Jeremy Renner) kick ass while on the run from a new U.S. government adversary (Edward Norton). Norton especially brings some real strength to the proceedings, and is riveting in all of his scenes. The viewer really buys into his character's well-meaning, but overzealous patriotism. Rachel Weisz is decent as the love interest, although she is basically reduced to acting helpless all the time. Stacey Keach is great as always, but seems sadly underutilized. The action scenes of hand-to-hand combat, car chases and shootouts are well-staged and exciting. Bottom line -- as familiar and perhaps formulaic as all of this is by now, I still want to see more of Renner's Kenneth Gitson. Let's hope we get two more movies to make it a new trilogy.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Really enjoyed this book. Even the minor characters were well composed. Been a while since I had this much trouble putting a book down.
0545265355|5.0|[Originally posted on fictionpredictions.blogspot.com]<br /><br />First off, can I just start by saying that I absolutely adore this series? These books are probably the first ones since ever to keep me up reading until 2a.m. The plot is fast-paced, with cliffhangers almost every chapter. The language is simple and adds to the pacing. The books are written in first-person POV, so we can really get in the head of Katniss and thus everything she does become much more relatable.<br /><br />But the one thing that The Hunger Games Trilogy has done exceptionally well is that it can evoke raw emotions. A lot. The theme it chooses is nothing new, but especially on the first read, the actions and the intensity and the thrill and the shock-value were overwhelming. I remember, as I flipped through the pages, thoughts racing through my head (just like Katniss racing through the forest - bad comparison, I know, but just had to throw that out there!) \\"Would I have done the same thing?\\" \\"Would I have felt the same way?\\"<br /><br />That said, the series is not without flaws. Some characters come across as shallow. There is a certain lack of minor details and plot twists which would probably have added a bit of depth and spiced up the books more. (Hint: If you're finished with the series, search for \\"The Pearl Plot of the Hunger Games\\". You'll be interested.) I'm a huge fan of books with foreshadowing to future plot points and all that, and The Hunger Games Trilogy seemed to be the kind of books that would be perfect for that, so I was disappointed to find that there was none.<br /><br />In addition, the qualities of the books seem to deteriorate: MILD SPOILER In the last book, Collins seem to be killing everybody just to get Katniss to the physical and mental state she wanted! I understand this is war, and it is supposed to be harsh, but it could still have resonated better with me if their deaths are described with more attention and emotions. I mean, on my first read I didn't even noticed that MY FAVORITE CHARACTER has died! END SPOILER The fast-pacing of the series, while suitable for the story it is telling, was continued to the end, creating an abrupt feel and non-closure (and spawning a lot of fanfictions.)<br /><br />Still, I would highly recommend the series to - practically anyone who can understand the theme of the books! It's an easy read, yet the questions it poses are as serious as any book can be.<br /><br />Ratings: 5 stars for the whole series. 5 for The Hunger Games, 4 for Catching Fire, and 3 for Mockingjay.n noticed that MY FAVORITE CHARACTER has died!

B008RV5K5E|5.0|I'm writing this review in response to the ridiculous and uninformed 1 and 2 star reviewers(Trying to balance the scales). If you are a fan of the original graphic novel this movie is based on, or are just a bat-fan in general, then buy this! very true to the book and the voice acting is great!
B009329Y30|5.0|I read the book a few months ago and had been waiting for this to come to Amazon, since I am not a fan of movie theaters. The acting was good, they captured the characters in the books well. I know they have to cut down from the book, but I wish they had kept some more of the book in the movie. Overall, I thought it held up well and is a movie that I would watch again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I highly recommend this book.  I really enjoyed it.  I finished reading the second book in the series, \\"Catching Fire\\", and have started reading \\"Mocking Jay\\".  If you like the movie, you will like the books even more!
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|This was a bit disappointing given the number of big names in it. I am not sure I would view any sequel...
0316212377|5.0|The Culture series can always be counted on for showing Iain Banks' writing at its best and the Hydrogen Sonata proves to be no exception to the rule.  If we haven't really had the full-on science-fiction ideas combined with explosive action experience since Excession, the series thereafter has shown a certain maturity, slowing down the pace to consider philosophical and metaphysical questions brought up in that book relating to the Other Side, on questions of Life, Death, Oblivion and the nature of what lies beyond the material world.  Those questions are to the fore again in The Hydrogen Sonata, thoughtfully considered and brilliantly interweaved into the whole culture of the Culture, but happily Banks' writing and the plot surrounding the story is once again at a dazzling level of wit and brilliance that we haven't seen from this author for a long time indeed.<br /><br />You might not expect that from the initial premise, where yet another civilisation, the Gzilt, have reached that stage in their evolution where, tired of existing with the mundane realm of matter and energy, they've made the collective decision to Sublime, crossing over to that indefinable place (between the seventh and eleventh dimensions we discover here) where all advanced cultures and civilisations eventually accede and effectively retire.  Some are surprised that the Gzilt have decided to make the big jump at this stage in their development, but with only 23 days left until the Instigation, many have already crossed over, leaving only a small remainder of their people to take care of the final ceremonies and housekeeping formalities, fending off Scavenger races and generally dealing with any last minute business that might crop up.  Inevitably, one ship turns up with a big surprise for the Gzilt, and suddenly chaos erupts.  The ship Minds of the Culture, and undoubtedly Special Circumstances, are of course very interested in the rumours that abound around the incident and send ships in to observe the final frenetic days of the Gzilt.<br /><br />Well, \\"observe\\" is of course a vague and rather passive term for the inquisitive intervention of the Culture, and of course it involves them gathering intelligence, searching for certain artifacts, transporting and in some cases reanimating stored individuals who might be able to satisfy their curiosity.  If I'm totally honest, there's nothing new in this - there's a lot of running around and a lot of confusion where you aren't quite sure what's going on sometimes, the usual conspiracies, bad guys and big secrets which may or may not prove to be anything more than a red herring (I hate it when he does that), and some usual gung-ho intervention - sorry, observation - from the Culture ships and SC operatives (presumably, but who knows?), with an innocent - usually female - figure caught up in it all.  It doesn't matter in the slightest when Banks has a concept as good as that of the Culture to play around with (if you haven't read a Culture book before, it won't matter either, because the author sums up the ideas concisely very early on, before getting straight on to business with little formality) and when his writing is as polished and witty as it is here, principally in all forms of interaction between the characters and, as you would expect, between the ship Minds.<br /><br />After the rather serious and grim tone of more recent Culture books - fine though most of them have been - and great as it is to see Banks' writing at his funniest, it's the intelligence of the ideas underpinning the work and the deeper questions that they raise that make this science-fiction writing of the highest order.  Since Look to Windward, the author has spent a great deal of time exploring these concepts relating to the non-material world beyond the Culture universe and offered tantalising glimpses of another reality, and he takes that another step further here in The Hydrogen Sonata, leaving just enough in reserve for further expansion.  I'm not sure how long he can continue to draw this theme out, and indeed the latest book is somewhat repetitive of a formula established in all his recent SF books, but the richness and intelligence of the Culture concept still seems to inspire the author's best writing and The Hydrogen Sonata is the most entertaining work we've had from Mr Banks in a long time.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|With all the books available today on exercise telling you what to do and what not, it is fantastic to find a book that goes beyond just page after page of pictures of exercises.  Bigger, leaner, stronger gives the detail on all the commonly used terminology which is off great benefit and link facts to a program that guarentees results.<br /><br />Congrats to Mike on the research and years of experience he put into this book.  Anyone who buy the book will not regret it!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Try as you will fingering out  the twists and turns in the WANTED MAN is like wandering through a Mase.  Just when you think  you know the direction Child is leading you, there will  be a change in direction and what you thought you knew is not what is happening at all.  How I love surprises in a novel.  Lee Child does not disappoint.  A great read.
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|I remember seeing it in the theater. It is kinda sad what they did to Truman. Truman showed great courage in stepping out of the only world he ever knew.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I've been one to say that 3D is only hype and a gimmick, and will not last. A few weeks ago my older DLP TV died, so I decided to get something thinner to mount onto the wall. What I got was an LG 60 inch plasma that came with 3D. Ok, I'll give it a shot.<br /><br />The Avengers was the second movie I've watched on the TV now. And I'll say, it's a fun gimmick. Its nothing I have to have for every movie I watch. But it made The Avengers fun to watch. Large sets really look cool in 3D. Like the area towards the beginning of the movie where Black Widow was being \\"interrogated.\\" Another cool scene was when the ship took off from the water. You got a better sense of scale with it.<br /><br />There are a few areas where the 3D was hard to watch. Quick camera pans. Not necessarily due to the 3D, but the limit of 24 fps. The limited number of frames during a quick pan, really made my eyes feel like they were hurting with the 3D. There were a few shots where I just couldn't tell what was supposed to be in the foreground, and what was in the background. Also, that made my eyes hurt trying to figure out what I was looking at. Those minor shots made for about 5% of the movie. So nothing really bothersome.<br /><br />There was one scene where I feel it was an error with the way the 3D was made, or shot. At first I thought it was my TV or glasses that were off, but I believe it was with the movie itself. It was a scene where Thor was talking to Loki. The camera angle that was focused on Loki, had double vision. I could see two outlines of his body. But the shots of Thor looked crisp. And it was back and forth cuts. And I could see two Loki's, but only one Thor. So I do not believe this was an issue with my hardware, but an issue with the actual 3D process. But again, that scene only lasted 10-15 seconds, so it wasn't too bad.<br /><br />So its fun. Its definitely worth watching in 3D if you have the ability to.
B008RYN44U|1.0|I've been a fan since I was 12. I can't count how many concerts I've been to. I've waited SO LONG for this to come out and I am just so sad. It sucks. I have to agree with the other person who commented and said they shouldn't have to train themselves to like an album. That's what I feel like I'm doing too because I have loved no doubt for so many years. It can be summed up as \\"solo-doubt\\" just as another reviewer put it.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to going to the concerts, but I don't think I will be going. I'm glad I got to see their last tour where they performed all their hits ... this CD is junk ... it doesn't even sound like them. It's so slow and boring.<br /><br />The thing I've always loved about No Doubt has been their lyrics. I grew up with them and went through the same things they sang about in their past albums. The lyrics on this album are somewhat contradicting and it feels as though it's like they didn't even write them.<br /><br />It's awful ... just terrible. I've listened to it all day and I just can't anymore. I miss No Doubt. I don't know who the heck this band is!<br /><br />They have officially sold out. I know they need to make money to keep their lifestyles going the way they're going and I think that's the sole reason they made this CD. I'm assuming this will be their last CD and it's really sad that they made it sound like all the other crap that's on the radio.<br /><br />The thing that was really the topping on the cake as far as them being sell outs is the part in the \\"settle down\\" video where Gwen is putting L'Oreal lip gloss on. I mean, really? C'mon ...<br /><br />You've done commercials. You've sold out to make-up companies. You did your clothing lines. You tried acting (lol). But why? Why did you make such an awful sell-out album?! Fans have been waiting SO long for this. You guys really suck.
B007RI56NY|5.0|Although I am a bit older than the average fan, I'm in my 50's, I love their somgs and vidoes.
B001L83PLQ|5.0|I had come across this title while doing research on a group known as MEND and the oil fiasco that has corrupted so much of this world. Half a Yellow Sun was mentioned in a non-fiction work by Robert Peele and came up again in several journals I had managed to find that were of use to me. I started reading Half a Yellow Sun without knowing what to expect and was pleasantly surprised by the author's skill at bringing to life characters in a world that, had thus far in my research, remained so distant. I entered Adichie's novel in an attempt to understand Biafra and the societal uprising that led to its creation and instead I was swept up and away by a plot and characters surrounded by circumstances beyond their control, in a culture that is masterfully painted upon the canvass of story telling. This is one of the few works I have chosen to use as an example of how to write, for my own works. A novel I will go back to, time and again, when seeking out inspiration and meaning and character portrayal.
B00702NWW4|5.0|She has a voice from the older styles of music, a gilded old-movie star/blues singer retro feel (and from her fashion, this is on purpose), counterbalanced with more modern background feel. You can hear the more synthesized sound of recent style but it blends to her vocals to be fresh and not mishmashed.
