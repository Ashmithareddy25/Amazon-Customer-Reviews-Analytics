B0002ZMITY|4.0|I love the show as it is funny to see Sacha ask silly questions while looking serious and the people being interviewed being completely lost or thinking he is out of his mind. <br /> <br />Those expressions on the show are really what makes it so funny...if anyone seen the short Andy Rooney clip then you would know what I mean. <br /> <br />Many people on these reviews have noted that they love the show but they hate the movie. Too many people wanted the same thing in the movie as in the show ala the MTV Jackass show and the movie being the same. <br /> <br />However I think they took a risk and just made a movie from the view of Ali G not Sacha...I think the gamble paid off. <br /> <br />Sure the humor is low brow and all but if you went into the movie thinking it would be otherwise, maybe you were not being too smart. <br /> <br />I thought the movie was very funny and kept me laughing many times and I have watched it numerous times. <br /> <br />The ONLY thing that irked me was they only gave Sacha's Borat character a 2-3 second cameo and he is what I find the funniest on the show. <br /> <br />I think it would have been very funny to see the borat character and ali g character interact some more with Borat trying to hug or do something to ali g. <br /> <br />But all in all this is a very funny movie...unless you are a prude or think you are going to get a longer version of the show.
B000BKVQTS|3.0|That is more or less how Gilliam opens his director commentary track. I just don't know when studios are going to get it. If you hire Terry Gilliam to direct your film, then let him direct your film. It's like hiring someone to paint your house, then painting radom parts of the house yourself in a completely differnt color. That being said..... <br /> <br />...The movie was entertaing. All the cast did a good job. The sets and locations were nice to look at. But, I wouldn't know who to actually recommend the movie to. Your casual viewer, expecting more of a high adventure studio film, might get stumped with some of those Gilliam touches, while a Gilliam fan could just get irritated that there arn't enough of them. All and all it's worth a watch.
0553801503|2.0|I am listening to the audio version of this book.  With the previous volumes, I have been enthralled; this one feels like a chore to get through.  So many of my favorite characters have been killed off in the first three volumes, and this book focuses on so many characters that I care nothing about. <br /> <br />I read the info that this volume is more of a preamble to the next installment, but I like to read books that have some redeeming content of their own.
B00070DK5K|5.0|I've always been a hardcore Bowie fan, but I've never gotten around to buying this album. I was put off by the negative reviews of the earlier reissue and decided to wait a while. Well, it paid off! I was walking through a music store the other day when I spotted the newly remixed and remastered CD. I bought it. Why did I wait so long?<br /><br />I have (I know, I know...) always been a fan of \\"Diamond Dogs\\". I think the songs are great glam rock with an apocalyptic and soul twist. This tour primarily features songs from \\"Diamond Dogs\\". However, at this stage in his career, Bowie was starting to morph out of the whole Ziggy Stardust/glam rock thing, which was starting to get a little tired by 1974. He had developed a liking for soul music, and would incorporate this into his next album, \\"Young Americans\\". However, when he went on his Diamond Dogs tour, he was stuck with glam songs but with soul on his mind. The result? David Live. In this album, we are given 6 songs from Diamond Dogs along with 15 other songs from his earlier albums. I have never had the privilege of seeing Bowie perform live, and hearing this album makes me regret that so much more. Forget about today's artists who put out an album made by a computer and fail miserably in any live show they do. Bowie's voice is clean, powerful and strong; everything it was on the studio albums. He infuses his classic songs with a fresh sound, not to say it improves on these masterpieces, it simply sheds new light on Bowie amazing artistic prowess and lets you view these songs through philly soul glasses. Bowie comes through strong on great songs like 'Rock N Roll Suicide', 'Diamond Dogs', 'Sweet Thing', '1984', and many others. One song that I found a little weak was 'Changes', his vocals seemed a little strained; but the rest of this great album more than makes up for it. One standout was 'Space Oddity', which was missing from the original release on CD. This track showcases Tony Visconti's brilliant remastering and remixing. The song was song into a telephone at the concert while Bowie was lifted above the audience. Listening to his new release, I would have never guessed. The remastering places Bowie's vocals front and center, and assigns a separate place for each instrument a place on the soundstage. Stereo seperation is flawless. This comes so close for passing as a studio album, it is truly stupefying. I have to do a reality check every few minutes that I'm listening to a concert recording from 1974! This album is truly a wonderful experience. I believe that no one can call themselves a true Bowie fan without owning this essential snapshot of a revolutionary era in this rock star's amazing ensemble. A must-buy.and remixing.

0689865384|5.0|The book, Uglies, by Scott Westerfeld, was an amazing book.  As soon as I started to read it, I could not put it down.  It was a new and unusual way to look at what is going to happen in the future.  From the very first chapter, Westerfeld, makes you want to read more and more of the book and then when you finish, it endes with a cliff-hanger and makes you want to read the sequel.    <br />I would recommend Uglies to any teenagers who enjoy reading lengthy action-packed books.   <br />

B000A3DFZE|5.0|I have been a fan of Eric Clapton since he was in Cream, and have every one of his CDs. I think that Mr. Clapton has earned the right to let his fans know that he has found love and happiness in his beautiful wife and children. I think he has accomplished that without being untrue to his roots. I for one, and happy that he has found happiness and I am enjoying this toe-tapping CD!
B000AMJG4Y|2.0|You'll be getting all the information on Fnial Fantasy 7 from most of the other writers, so I'll go straight for the gut. The largest flaws in this movie are the action sequences which are poorly directed and often difficult to follow. I know FF7 has always sported some incredibly bombastic moves and \\"Limits\\" from its characters but this film presents its fight sequences as if they were Dragon Ball Z (which isnt a show anyone should be emmulating in the first place) knock offs. I truly hated these choppy fight sequences, they really marred the rest of this otherwise good film. The poor translation on the subtitles just add to the corny vibe of the fight scenes. I say watch this with this in mind and try to enjoy our FF7 character in updated graphics.

1401207138|5.0|As with many people, I had multiple friends yelling at me to read this book, telling me it was one (if not the) best comics ever written. Conclusion? They were right. This book is great for all the undoubtedly hundreds of reasons that other people have mentioned. I just want to point out one thing about this book that I love...<br /><br />Right after reading this I read The Dark Phoenix Saga. It was only then that I realized that the Watchment has no thought bubbles, sound effects or narrative outside of the journals and books the characters write. That in my opinion is what makes Watchmen great. You get a complete feeling of the characters' emotions, thoughts, sounds and everything else without Alan Moore having to spell it out or spoon feed you. Instead, the dialogue and Artwork tell all the story, and this technique provides an incredibly realistic and engrossing feel to the Watchmen world. This, in combination with the incredibly complex and thought provoking story, really help to get the mind working and involved in the book. I just wish more comic books did this =).
B000BTJDGC|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with this film. One thing that I didn't expect was the court room drama. I was more hoping for the lines of the Exorsist. But having said this, it was a very good and very well put together film.<br /><br />This film is about a Father (of a church) put on trial for the death of Emily Rose. The court room drama suggests Emily Rose as being mentally ill, with seizures to boot. The Father's side of the story was that she wasn't mentally ill at all but rather her body/soul was taken over by demons (six of them) and the reason why the exorsim failed was because of the medications that the doctors put her on.<br /><br />Intwind with the courtroom drama was the true story of Emily Rose. How she became pocessed by the demons! Again, as other reviewers have pointed out, the film is about faith, what you believe, what you don't believe. What could possible be, even if we don't want it to be! I think I would have loved the film moreso if there wasn't so much courtroom to it but I recommend the movie nonetheless!! Therefore I still give it 4 out of 5 stars because it can make you think!

B000AGTPUA|4.0|There's very little to not like about The Polar Express which is based on one of the loveliest, illustrated Christmas books by a wonderful artist Chris Van Allsburg. While short on plot the sentiment and beauty make it well worth watching. <br /> <br />This is a movie that for adults and children who are in that awkward stage of wondering if they believe or not, can rekindle the spirit of Christmas. (NOTE: The children are not named except for the poorest child who is Billy.) There are some touching and wonderful moments such as when the very together black girl saves hot chocolate for the poor white child, Billy, who is sitting in the rear train car all alone; when the main character confesses that he stopped the train to allow Billy to get on when he fell; when the main character confesses to losing the black girl's ticket and tries to make it right; when Billy and the black girl join in a lovely, heart wrenching duet about Christmas coming to town; when the main child finally can 'hear' the sleigh bells on Santa's sleigh; when Billy realizes he has a gift and when he is returned to a home that now has a tree and a wreath on the door. <br /> <br />I know I'll be buying this film to join my holiday movie collection. It's sure to become a classic and I hope it will help me to hear the sleigh bells throughout my life.
B000AARKOO|5.0|Yes, this movie is a morality play, but it is an excellent morality play. Balian is the essence of the true knight incarnate. This is a man who takes the oath seriously:<br /><br />Be without fear in the face of your enemies.<br /><br />Be brave and upright that God may love thee.<br /><br />Speak the truth even if it leads to your death.<br /><br />Safeguard the helpless.<br /><br />He follows this oath even if \\"doing a small evil will result in a great good.\\" He follows this oath, and his own conscience, even if it means disobediance to a beloved king. For \\"A King may move a man, a father may claim a son, but remember that even when those who move you be Kings, or men of power, your soul is in your keeping alone. When you stand before God, you cannot say, \\"But I was told by others to do thus.\\" Or that, \\"Virtue was not convenient at the time.\\" This will not suffice. Remember that.\\"\\"<br /><br />Yes, this is a morality play, but when is the last time you saw true morality exalted anywhere, even in a play? I found it both refreshing and inspiring.

B00005GS48|5.0|Paying homage to the Nat Cole Trio, the most popular jazz combo of its day, Diana Krall (piano), Russell Malone (guitar), and Paul Keller (bass) bring some long-time favorites and some lesser known Cole Trio hits to life. The arrangements are terrific, ranging from slow, bluesy numbers, to swing, a torchy ballad, and forties-style jive. In every case, the emphasis is on the trio, and though Krall sings on every track, more than half of each song is instrumental, with extended solos on piano by Krall and on guitar by Russell Malone.<br /><br />Krall's voice is a full, sometimes husky, alto with very little vibrato, and though she can sing scat, and does on \\"Frim Fram Sauce,\\" she is at her best singing slow songs of aching loss, where, occasionally, her phrasing reminds me of Sarah Vaughan. \\"Gee, Baby, Ain't I Good to You,\\" sung slower than Cole did it, is a sad, bluesy number with wonderful, casual jazz piano riffs. \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams,\\" my favorite on the album, is torchy, the imagined tears kept under control as Krall pines for lost love, with the piano ranging into chromatic variations. In \\"You Call It Madness\\" and \\"I'm Through With Love,\\" Krall keeps her voice whispery, singing slowly, almost confidentially, as she maintains the slow beat and melancholy mood. By contrast, \\"Hit That Jive, Jack,\\" moves in a quick, toe-tapping rhythm, as Krall, Malone, and Keller sing together and have fun.<br /><br />The album has plenty of variety to the selections and features three fine jazz instrumentalists who toured together and perfected their ensemble for several months before recording this album. With the earthy voice of Krall added to the instrumental mix, this album is certainly one of Krall's best--a huge success. There are no drums here (except on \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\"), but that is not a limitation, and, in fact, may be an advantage, since the listener's attention remains focused on the tunefulness of the songs and their jazz variations. This is a fine homage to the Nat Cole Trio, which would have been justly proud of Krall's recording. Mary WhippleNat Cole Trio, which would have been justly proud of Krall's recording. Mary Whipple

0552149519|1.0|Unaware of the plot and the hype surrounding the book, I bought \\"The Da Vinci code\\" ONLY because it was displayed as the No.1 selling book in the store. However, I still regret the decision to this day.<br /><br />The story starts off as a riveting read with plenty of action, suspense, and mystery. Unfortunatly, I had to put the book down about a third of the way through by virtue of the nonsensical and unsubstantiated claims the plot tacitly insinuates.
B000BKJ78U|1.0|Like others here I was befuddled when I originally saw this disc set at my local store and quickly snatched it up looking it over for a glimpse that my prayers have been answered and Lucas released a remastered version of the original films from my childhood including the original ewok song ending to Ep. VI.  Believing that the use of the ORIGINAL artwork for the discs' box and no mention of the special editions on the box I bought a copy happy that I had in fact just missed this release due to my busy work schedule leading up to the holidays, but an hour later I was ready to call Lucasfilm and raise hell with their deceptive marketing practices. <br /> <br />DO NOT BUY THIS SET.  If you want this set pay a bit more and get the bonus disc, Lucas must be made to understand that the fans WANT the original CLASSIC films on DVD, not some repackaged gimmick to pry more money from his fans.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|The long-awaited film version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's smash stage hit, The Phantom of the Opera, is everything fans will expect and more. <br /> <br />The story takes place in 1870, as the company of the Paris Opera House is plagued by mysterious happenings said to be caused by a ghost. Rising star Christine Daae is caught in a love triangle, torn between her romantic childhood crush, the dashing Raoul de Chagny, and her tutor of many years, the reclusive \\"Angel of Music\\". But the latter turns out to be the Phantom, whose desperate need to be loved descends into insanity as he first stalks, then kidnaps, his muse. <br /> <br />The screenplay has been modified to include additional dialogue, expanded roles for both Raoul and Madame Giry (it's clear she knows more than she is letting on), and the infamous collapse of the chandelier occurs much later in the story. Further, flashbacks (including scenes when the principal characters were children) explain some of the questions that only readers of Gaston Leroux's 1910 novel knew the answers to. <br /> <br />Any cinematic treatment of a live show should try to outdo its progenitor, and director Joel Schumacher has successfully met the challenge. Every frame is filled with movement and colour which, thankfully, do not suffer from the pervading darkness of Evita. Dream-like sequences accentuate the melancholy mood, and the highly-detailed costumes and sets are exquisite. <br /> <br />The cast of largely unfamiliar faces is headed by Emmy Rossum as Christine. She gives the role a luminous vitality, and has a wonderful octave range; every moment she appears on screen is enchanting. Patrick Wilson is quite impressive as Raoul and is poised for leading-man status. But the true star is Minnie Driver, whose interpretation of the self-centred Diva, Carlotta, is worthy of an Oscar. <br /> <br />Sadly, the lavish production is wasted on the effort of Gerard Butler who, in the title role, is the film's only disappointment. Althoughhis passion for and understanding of the Phantom's sorrow is evident, he seems to have been cast more for his sex appeal than musical talent. His singing lacks power and is better suited to hard rock than opera; dressed in black and white and with an open shirt, he resembles a member of 70's band KISS. As a result, the Phantom is merely the boy from the wrong side of the tracks, as opposed to a tortured composer and svengali. (And when his disfigurement is finally revealed, it is -- oddly -- barely gruesome, looking like nothing more than eczema.) <br /> <br />The biggest mystery in The Phantom of the Opera, then, is not on screen, but why Lloyd Webber is so fond of Butler. Still, it is the best adaptation of a musical in decades. The uninitiated who never saw the original show may find the film somewhat trite, but the tragic tale will put a tear in your eye. Rating: 8 out of 10. <br />
B000001G53|5.0|Parsifal, one of Wagner's three great Schopenhauerian works, requires a conductor who has a cohesive vision for the entire stage drama that not only brings the entire story together, but engages the audience in a philosophical atmosphere which makes you think about the several psychological nuances experienced by the characters.  It is not very hard to play for the orchestra, despite the fact that it is still Wagner, but to bring the truth out of Parsifal takes more than just whipping some baton around to get a note-perfect performance.  You need a sense of spirituality and sacredness, and the drama must be there too.  I believe that besides the recently released \\"forgotten\\" recording by Rafael Kubelik with the late James King, Kurt Moll, and Yvonne Minton, only Herbert von Karajan and his Berlin Philharmonic and the well-selected cast was able to achieve this vision. <br /> <br />Most reviewers accuse Karajan of smoothing over the music of Parsifal at the expense of the drama.  I would beg to disagree, as I believe that musically, Karajan's dynamics are perfect for the opera, and his choice of rubato is so well-placed that he brings a sense of spirituality to the opera.  It's as if the magnificent string playing of the Berlin Philharmonic along with the brass ensemble and the percussions could easily transport you to the mythical realm of Montsalvat.  The Verwandlungsmusik is played to perfection, the Prelude sublime and rapturous, and the character leitmotif's are without a doubt...done just right.  Orchestra wise, this Parsifal is played to perfection. <br /> <br />As for the cast, well, it is true that Karajan could have chosen better singers, but these seasoned Wagnerians have done nothing but achieve the vision that he sought for in his recording.  Jose Van Dam is simply the best Amfortas I've heard on record.  He may not have George London's large voice, but his singing is so sensitive that you can easily feel the anguish and torture Amfortas is feeling.  Karajan's excellent ear for balances allows the orchestra to enhance all the pain and longing that Amfortas yearns for.  As for Gurnemanz, I don't think anyone can beat Hans Hotter when it comes to authority, but Kurt Moll sings the role most beautifully and so naturally, with an excellent sense of drama to boot, that I could easily place him beside Hans Hotter.  Only Hotter's Act III could slightly be ahead of Moll's, but Moll's achievement is simply outstanding in this one.   <br /> <br />The Kundry and Parsifal in this recording are often the subject of many a Wagnerian's debate regarding K's choice for casting.  Dunja Vejzovic was one of the greatest Slavic sopranos of the past century, with a range that extends from a mezzo to high soprano.  Alas, her top is shrill to some listeners' tastes, but for a Callas fan such as I, this isn't much of a problem.  I think she brings such a demented and pitiful, yet seductive quality to her Kundry whenever such characteristics are needed.  Dramatically, hers is an intense performance, with only Christa Ludwig's achievement exceeding hers.  Still, others do appreciate her performance, and I would put it second behind Christa Ludwig's great Kundry.  Peter Hofmann, on the other hand, sings a most young and convincing Parsifal.  And once again we come to the subject of the wobble.  I never heard an absurd one in this recording, and I think his achievement in this recording is equalled only by Jess Thomas.  Not even Placido Domingo, whose Wagnerian interpretations are known for their bel canto qualities, touched the young fal parsi that Hofmann and Thomas brought to their performances.  A great Parsifal indeed.  One would wish that the voice were firmer, but I think we could overlook that and see such a fresh and young interpretation given to the role. <br /> <br />For the supporting cast, I think Siegmund Niemsgern gives an excellent Klingsor.  It's not an Alberich Klingsor, but a sorcerer Klingsor, just right.  The Flower Maidens are sung beautifully, and the Stimme from Above is sung by none other than the great mezzo Hanna Schwarz.  Luxurious casting, great orchestra, and a conductor who knows the ABC's of Wagner conducting, plus a most sacred atmosphere created by the recording, and I think you have a Parsifal for the ages.  Highly recommended.
B00080ZG10|4.0|The Aviator traces the life of legendary billionaire, playboy, independent filmmaker, and aviation pioneer Howard Hughes from 1927 to 1947. <br /> <br />The story begins during production of Hughes' air battle epic Hell's Angels, delayed due to his fixation with insignificant details. When the end of filming coincided with the advent of talkies, Hughes reshot the entire picture with sound -- at a cost of $4 million, it was the most expensive picture ever made. <br /> <br />Hughes' obsession with aircraft would continue. He later bought TWA, set an air speed record, created a spy plane (and suffered extreme injuries and burns in a spectacular crash during its test flight), and also built and flew the infamous troop ship dubbed the Spruce Goose. <br /> <br />Leonardo DiCaprio shines as the tortured industrialist, despite his squeaky voice and the fact he bears no resemblance to Hughes. Completely assuming the role, it is the best performance of his career. Not only do we see Hughes' genius, but the beginnings of his OCD, paranoia, and fear of germs, all of which foreshadows the recluse to come. Cate Blanchett's portrayal of Katherine Hepburn, with whom Hughes had a lengthy and torrid relationship, is astounding; she perfectly recreates the unique vocalizations and bearing of the screen icon. Also appearing in smaller roles are Alan Alda, Alec Baldwin, Willem Dafoe, Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner, Jude Law as Errol Flynn, and singer Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow. <br /> <br />Under the capable hands of director Martin Scorsese, the film is stylish and riveting. The story advances quickly with no extraneous scenes, but ends up being a little too long. Further, due to Scorsese's own obsession with putting art over entertainment, he has inexplicably and needlessly tinted everything green in the first half of the movie blue. <br /> <br />Overall, The Aviator is a magnificent depiction of a decadent time and those who lived it. For them, the Depression and WWII were nothing more than trivialities in the news. A captivating era. A captivating man. A captivating film. Rating: 8 out of 10. <br />
B00005JO1Y|5.0|I can't begin to explain how much it iritates me to see people bash this movie, or say it's a bad film. These are probably the same type of people that watched it and laughed throughout the most dramatic parts. Yea, analyze it, the camera, the script, every technical aspect, way to ruin it for yourself! Enough with all the ignorant reviews, to the movie. Take it for what it is, go into it with an open mind, and think about the feelings behind the faces. This is one of the most emotional films I've seen all year, and it doesn't need to come off looking sophisticated or intelligent for it to be just that, so film snobs and critics can close their mouths. It's much better than the original, you really feel for King Kong. It makes you realise how shallow humans really are. You can even view the movie metaphorically. There are  many King Kong's in this world right now, unloved, hurt, and just looking for someone to spend their life with, but because of their frame, they will never get what they truely want. I thought Jack Black would ruin the movie, but he played his part well, and at times you really wished that he died. This movie is very long, and the score is incredible. The special effects are INCREDIBLE! There's enough action in this movie to keep anyone satisfied, and those who said it was a boring film can go back to sticking their nose in the trendy novel they bought trying to fit in with what they think is different. If you get teary easily, keep a some tissue nearby. Movie of the year, for sure.
B00005JM0B|3.0|I know that this does not match the other Terminator movies. <br />The plot laggs a lot more and it only gets repetitive. <br />They added humor and lost some story. <br />Character acting is not that good, but then there are some good actors (mainly the terminators). <br />The animation and stuff is very good, but it didn't feel like a terminator movie. <br />Rent it before buying. <br />One thing is for sure, T1 and T2 far outmatch this sequel.
0679422714|3.0|An unremittingly negative portrayal of the Great Helmsman. No doubt much is true, but the authors often take great leaps in ascribing specific motives to Mao that can not be easily proved, one way or the other.<br /><br />The book provides a neat unified theory for almost all political events associated with Mao's PRC: e.g., the Long March, World War II battles, the role of Chou En-lai, the Korean and Vietnam wars, the Cultural Revolution, and Nixon's surprise trip. In many ways, too neat.<br /><br />It will be appreciated when a master historian, with full access to archives and prior scholarship, writes a more detached biography of Mao. I think he will still be judged supremely evil--<br /><br />but I am certain many of the events covered in this book will be given a more subtle and accurate description. The many millions of ordinary people who suffered and died during this hard time deserve no less.
0670033375|5.0|People and cultures seem to many things that don't make sense in retrospect. This book asks and attempts to answer the question of why once successful societies disappeared. Diamond combines an historical perspective with a discussion of modern day comunities so that we can see the parallels, and perhaps make better decisions in the future. While not an easy read, Diamond makes a complicated subject very approachable. This is a thought-provoking book that you should read if you are interested in society, the environment, or even just general decision making processes.
0553801503|5.0|Yes, this book does follow roughly half of the characters that we love, but it is still written superbly with the same depth of characters and advancement of plot we have come to expect from Mr. Martin.

His riffs are both heavy and catchy. His solos are just extremely clean and fast, as many people have mentioned already. Even his acoustic playing is great. He also adds the right amount of feeling and emotion everytime. Especially noteworthy solos are during \\"Of Sins and Shadows\\", \\"Sea of Lies\\" and all throughout the title track. Next there is the best keyboard player in all of metal, Michael Pinnela. Everything he touches turns to gold. Some of his best work is featured in \\"The Accolade\\" and the title track as well. As far the the rhythm section goes, there are absolutely no complaints at all. Thomas Miller and Jason Rullo are both top notch musicians. Last but no least, vocal god Russel Allen. He is surely among the elite class of singers today. It's no wonder this is my favorite band seeing as how 3/5 musicians in this band rank as my favorites.<br /><br />The final thing I must mention are my two favorite songs on the album. \\"The Accolade\\" is possibly one of the most beautiful songs ever written. Russel Allen sings his heart out and Pinnela's keyobards are just immaculate. The title track is also one of the best songs ever written. Over 20 minutes of musical bliss.<br /><br />I'm still certain I haven't been able to express all I have to say about this album in words, but it's the best I can do for now. If you consider yourself a fan of progressive metal, your collection cannot be complete without this album.

Go nuts.
B000AOEMXM|1.0|Somewhere a ways back TV did this thing called Star Trek. Now despite its' many flaws and lousy episodes, this little TV series became the \\"little TV show that could\\".  Decades later a new generation of writers/producers take control and attempt to rewrite the beginnings of this now epic tale.  With nothing even close to a stern to steer this ship with, \\"Enterprise\\" leaves dry dock and sails on a journey,, well a journey of the damned.  Four seasons of truly disjointed stories.  Each and every season is a temporal anomoly of the previous.  Picture \\"Groundhog Day\\" meets \\"Alien\\" meets \\"Deep Star Six\\" Meets \\"2001\\" meets \\"Star Wars\\"....etc etc   Remember that is why they say \\"blow the hatch\\", you can't get sucked into space, unless you buy this...and by the way, as others have noted, this set is actually more expensive than seperately. Geeez!  I guess if you keep running spin-offs of even the best of franchises you will eventually bury it.    Live Long And Prosper.     Enterprise sure didn't.... <br /> <br />note: I actually was torn between the ideas the second and third seasons came up with (either would have been my favorite season but not both), they were like alternate universes to me.  Being a big Trek fan I couldn't see this show being more important than the future time frames, when it, of course, was unknown.
1592400876|4.0|The joke alluded to in the title is based on the different meaning the phrase \\"eats, shoots and leaves\\" takes on, depending on whether there is a comma after \\"eats\\" or not.  If so (as above) the panda may partake of his food, fire a parting shot and exit out the door.  If the comma is omitted, the phrase is a description of what the panda eats; that is, the panda eats \\"shoots and leaves.\\"  (For the full joke, see the back cover of the book.)<br /><br />Well, yes, punctuation DOES matter, and Lynne Truss does an excellent job of demonstrating that fact beyond any reasonable doubt.  And she does it with humor, a sharp tone and some more or less convincing research as she quotes authorities as diverse as George Bernard Shaw and Ben Johnson, Gertrude Stein and James Thurber.  She also quotes academic authorities such as H.W. Fowler and Eric Partridge, although she leaves out my favorite authority, Bryan A. Garner, maybe because he's an American authority.  Nonetheless, Ms. Truss knows her stuff and she is far from shy about expressing herself.<br /><br />Part of the considerable humor in the book comes from her oh so British expression (\\"sticklers,\\"\\"banging on,\\" \\"footballers,\\" etc. ) and part from her delightful personification of the marks of punctuation (as when she speaks, for example, of the \\"sufferings\\" of the \\"poor, oddly placed little apostrophe\\") and part from her sharp, observant eye.<br /><br />And part of the effectiveness of the book stems from Truss's ability to bring to life the phenomenon of punctuation and to relate it to our daily lives.  Her stickler tone is modulated by her progressive understanding that language is always in a constant state of flux, and that what is proper today may very well not be proper some years from now.  She shows us that there was a time when neither the colon nor the semicolon existed, and she warns of a time (possibly hastened by the Internet) when they may disappear.<br /><br />Although her use of punctuation marks is exemplary (for the most part: see below), Truss does have a few problems with the language itself.  For example, while addressing the missing (or not missing) apostrophe in \\"dead sons photos,\\" Truss demands to know \\"whether the photos in question show one son or several.\\" (p. 27)  Actually she should write \\"one son or more than one son\\" or something similar, since what she does write, \\"one son or several\\" very distinctly leaves out the possibility of exactly two sons.<br /><br />And sometimes Ms. Truss is too much of a vigilante. On page 34, for example, she tells us how she painted over the wrong apostrophe in a cartoon showing some \\"stupid-looking people\\" gawking at a sign that reads \\"Illiterate's Entrance.\\"  She changed it to \\"Illiterates' Entrance\\" and felt very good about herself.  However, whether the apostrophe should be before or after the \\"s\\" really depends on the meaning intended.  If the cartoonist meant \\"entrance for illiterates\\" then Truss's correction is correct.  If however, the cartoonist meant \\"entrance for the illiterate\\" then her correction is in error.<br /><br />Truss speaks of punctuation errors that grate on her sensibilities like fingernails scraping a chalkboard.  I know exactly how she feels since I feel the same way when people use the word \\"infinite\\" when they really mean \\"many\\" or \\"endless\\" to refer to something that is not endless, as Truss does on page 88.  She is referring to writers who have on occasion wrote ungrammatically.  She writes, \\"the list is endless.\\"  There are many, many writers who have written ungrammatically, but their number is far short of endless.<br /><br />A question might arise as you are reading this book and marveling on how such a stuffy subject can be brought to such vibrant life, and that question might be, \\"How is it that these simple marks are infused with such meaning?  The answer lies in the long history of their use (which is why Truss gives us so many historical examples and indeed why she refers to history at all).  However, the deep meaning with which each and every punctuation mark is infused, and the subtle distinctions of their use, can only be fully appreciated by those who have done a lot of reading and writing.  With this thought in mind, I say LEAVE THE GREENGROCER ALONE!<br /><br />(I don't mean to shout, but Amazon does NOT support italics.)<br /><br />As for Truss's expressive style, I like it.  I especially like all the old-fashioned Britishisms that she bandies about allowing me to imagine her as an old maid school teacher with wooden ruler in hand, her hair up in a grey bun, staring down at a misbehaving student through her bifocals.  However, sometimes her expression is a bit over the edge, as when she twice refers to what an exclamation mark is sometimes called.  (I can only say a dog has one, but see page 163.)<br /><br />Sometimes she gets a bit wordy, as when she speculates (p. 186) \\"where The Guardian got its ideas from.\\"  (The \\"from\\" is superfluous.)<br /><br />All in all, however, Ms. Truss is to be complimented on writing a popular tour de force that is witty, lively, a pleasure to read and, for the most part, highly instructive.  May hers not be the last best seller that works to improve the quality of the written word.refers to history at all).

B0009MAP9A|5.0|Bob Dylan is not special. He is so utterly human and normal and even somewhat priveledged. He was a young middle-class-or-better Jewish art student from Deluth, MN who had an odd liking of blues and country western music while rock and roll was just getting under way in the minds of most young people his age. And the songs on this album show what normal, ordinary human beings can make. And that is the essence of what Bob Dylan, I think, really was trying to further throughout his music career. Holding up the ordinary gritty side of human life, not the version that can be seen from a car window passing through the run down part of town.<br /><br />His was far from an easy mass sell, initally. I don't know if he always succeeded in making every song that he took on authentically his, but he made valiant attempts in nearly every case. In our 2000's era, he is strangely still foreign and distant from us. Only Leonard Cohen and Bruce Springsteen and a handful of other names come to mind that remind us of Dylan's best, most authentic folk songwriting and recordings. It's important to remember and take stock of how many of the quirks of Dylan's style and genre-spawning have shaped popular music. Everything that, for most listeners, will initially seem \\"familiar\\" about Dylan is so because directly due to his influence on later music of our time, and not generally due to musical influences that weighed into the making of them in his (now largely foreign to most younger listeners).<br /><br />I was never that huge a fan of Bob Dylan as a teen (having heard too much of how great he was and not enough of his more original songwriting) until several years back I bought this particular album, and then I went back through them one by one. This is still my favorite, but approaching a legend through a legitimately earned emblem of their fame is how to see the legitimacy of that legend under a microscope, you might say. \\"With God on Our Side\\" is an anthem that certainly outdrums recognized generation anthem, \\"The Times Are a Changin',\\" for passion and lethally poignant indignation and conscience. \\"Boots of Spanish Leather\\" is a genuinely romantic little ballad that makes you feel how important it is to be fully alive. \\"One Too Many Mornings\\" has plucking and harmonica blessings and lyrics and pace that are beautiful.<br /><br />\\"North Country Blues\\" really is a classic minstrel ballad that almost mideval in sound and feel, but for the acute acoustic guitar strummings and the harrowed gravel that is Dylan's voice.<br /><br />Above all, however, is the powerful storytelling prowess, that may sound to some like trivial rambling, until you gain enough milage to see from whence the familiar patterns come--they come from Dylan, and before him people like Woodie Guthrie (whom he actually spent time with at his hospital deathbed), Hank Williams (Sr.), and nameless others in Dustbowl graves long before decayed, and whom not-so-many now would easily recognize. Really, this is original as can be, passionate-honesty-in-your-face that makes you understand why people remember Dylan as a quintessential American voice of honest passion and dissenting reason.on anthem, \\"The Times Are a Changin',\\" for passion and lethally poignant indignation and conscience. \\"Boots of Spanish Leather\\" is a genuinely romantic little ballad that makes you feel how important it is to be fully alive. \\"One Too Many Mornings\\" has plucking and harmonica blessings and lyrics and pace that are beautiful.    \\"North Country Blues\\" really is a classic minstrel ballad that almost mideval in sound and feel, but for the acute acoustic guitar strummings and the harrowed gravel that is Dylan's voice.

B00009MGGI|5.0|House of Cards, a BBC production done at the time of Margaret Thatcher's downfall, is one of the best modern political intrigue/satires done. The cast, the story, and the exacting attention to detail make this a piece worth watching and re-watching, to see what details escaped notice the first time.<br /><br />The Plot<br />As the story opens, Thatcher has just resigned. There is a brief glimpse of an inner-party election for a new leader, and the moderate, middle candidate Henry Collingridge wins the post, and proceeds to barely win the next General Election. Almost immediately following this event, tempers begin to flare as Urqhart is denied the promotion he had sought, and is disgusted with Collingridge's 'politics as usual' stance.<br /><br />Francis Urqhart, Conservative Party whip and functionary, with the unwitting assistance of a junior political reporter Mattie Storin, and the manipulated support of party functionary Roger O'Neill, sets out to undo the Prime Minister, involving the PM in scandals that rock his fragile majority and ever-loosening grip on power. Ultimately, Urqhart's schemes against Collingridge bring the PM down, and the stage is set for another leadership election.<br /><br />Urqhart, at the urging of his wife Elizabeth, works toward the leadership and works toward solidifying the loyalties of his minions, who include the ruffian Tim Stamper, an associate whip in the Commons, and Benjamin Landless, a newspaper proprietor. However, it is in making Storin his bedroom partner and virtual worshipper that Urqhart has his strongest support; this support is not absolute, something he recognises. This relationship is done with the blessing, nay, with the urging, of his wife Elizabeth.<br /><br />Urqhart uses his inside knowledge to make short work of all but the top contenders for the job, and then casts his lot for the job at the last moment, splitting the ticket. Knocking one contender against another one final time, Urqhart carries the election. However, O'Neill is unstable and unsure of the propriety of his dealings in bringing down Collingridge, and Storin realises at the last moment that she has been a pawn in a master political chess game. O'Neill's cocaine problem leads to his demise, as Urqhart plants poison in his drugs and permits O'Neill's nature to do him in. Storin discovers this murder plot, and confronts Urqhart, who confesses, but then proceeds to throw Mattie Storin bodily from the roof of the House of Commons.<br /><br />But, there was a tape recorder running, setting the stage for the sequel...<br /><br />`To Play the King' is the sequel, in which Urqhart matches forces against the newly installed King, played by Michael Kitchen.  The King sees himself as the champion of the underdog and underclass Urqhart has abandoned, and it is a literal battle royale to the end.  Storin has been replaced by Sarah Harding, who finds Urqhart is more than a match for her minor turncoating as well.<br /><br />Finally, `The Final Cut' brings things full circle, as Urqhart beats Thatcher's record of unbroken days in office.  However, his lust for power drives him into reckless foreign affairs, and his wife comes into her own with scheming beyond measure.<br /><br />The Cast<br />Ian Richardson is masterful as Urqhart, the scheming blackheart Chief Whip/Prime Minister. His voice, his subtle inflections and tones are perfect for the subtext in the words he speaks. His sidewise glances and knowing expressions to camera as the action plays out is worth far more than any words. He is a perfect snobbish, upper-class politico who considers political office as patrician right, and despises pretenders to the role.<br /><br />Diane Fletcher is superb as Elizabeth Urqhart, the equally manipulative wife. She is under utilised in this part of the trilogy, coming into her own as a character and an actress in later parts of the trilogy. One gets the strong sense of muted ambition and greed, but not amorality or power for power's sake from her, a distinction hard to play out on video. Fletcher succeeds beautifully.<br /><br />Susannah Harker plays Mattie Storin, the troubled, intelligent and inexperienced journalist who falls for Urqhart. Her psychological instability and intelligence are played beautifully. Harker can make quite a statement just with the movements of her eyes, making her a good counterpoint to Richardson.<br /><br />Miles Anderson plays the drug addict/party operative Roger O'Neill, doing a good job at playing the cad, the coward, and the fearful go-along with Urqhart's schemes. A rat trapped, O'Neill is at the breaking point, and Anderson plays this admirably.<br /><br />Perhaps the best secondary roles were performed by Alphonsia Emmanuel, who plays O'Neill's assistant and lover Penny Guy, and James Villiers, who plays Charles Collingridge, the deposed Prime Minister's troubled brother. Their roles shine brilliantly despite the relative lack of screen time.<br /><br />In the second series, Michael Kitchen as the King and Kitty Aldridge as Sarah Harding take primary roles, and Colin Jeavons as Stamper repeats his performance of the earlier episode, this time with much more panache.  In the third series, Isla Blair as Claire Carlsen and Paul Freeman make a good show, if not altogether convincing as the final opponents for Urqhart.<br /><br />One gets the impression that everyone in British politics is brilliant and troubled. Well, the truth would be about half that.<br /><br />The Play's the Thing...<br />This production, in writing and execution, is full of Shakespearean nuances. There are indirect and direct references to Richard III, and Urqhart is a Machiavellian manipulator in the Duke of Gloucester's image, recast for modern dress and situation, complete with stage whispers and asides to audience. The depth of the characters, while still remaining caricatures, is fascinating. Perhaps the best-known line for a while was Urqhart's attempts to get information out to the journalist Storin without actually telling her, and being guilty (by the letter of the law) for leaks and disclosures. She would hint and speculate, at which Urqhart would reply, `You might very well think that. I of course couldn't possibly comment.'<br /><br />John Major used this response in one of his own question-time exchanges, a use that was appreciated by the Members on both sides of the House.<br /><br />Conclusions<br />For those who know nothing of British politics, this is actually a fascinating way to learn. For those who take an interest in British politics, this provides an intriguing fictional tale that is, in many ways, so close to reality on so many levels as to be positively unnerving.<br /><br />Richardson rightly won BAFTA awards for his portrayal of Urqhart in each of the three installments, House of Cards and its sequels To Play the King and The Final Cut. These sequels were possibly only because of a BBC change to Dobbs' original manuscript, which had Urqhart rather than Storin falling from the rooftop garden of the House of Commons.<br /><br />A bonus for the viewer.succeeds beautifully.

B000BNX3AU|5.0|I had heard a lot about this movie from another reviewer friend of mine, but hesitated at first because so many of John Cusack's recent films have been a bit disappointing.  I was pleasantly surprised because, though this romantic comedy is nothing earth shatteringly new, it worked for me!  Cute, sparkling dialogue, and a fantastic cast in Cusack, Diane Lane, Christopher Plummer, Stockard Channing, Elizabeth Perkins, and Dermot Mulroney.  These are the things that make an otherwise rather conventional formula script come to life in its own way.<br /><br />Without going into the plot like so many others have, I will state what I think makes the movie work.  Diane Lane is a woman other women my age (none of your friggin' business!) can relate to, and the bad dates, familial meddling, and other embarrassing situations definitely hit home.  John Cusack--yes, I admit I'm a fan--is believable as a romantic lead because he isn't great looking, which makes him the \\"normal guy\\" believable that women end up chosing more times than not over a Brad Pitt type.  Add to the fact that his character has the obscure interest in boat making and is romantically sensitive, and you know the girls are going to love this dating movie.<br /><br />The supporting cast is as strong as the leads, and I found myself simultaneously laughing or being moved quite often.  Most pleasing to me was that the family dog, Mother Teresa, was a Newfoundland, because they are so very rarely used in movies, and I happen to have a dog that is part Newfie and lab.  They tend to be loyal, lovable animals just like that one, and are the greatest companions.  If you can overlook the cliche's and are just in the mood for a thoroughly entertaining romance flick, please check out Must Love Dogs.  It may just be your cup of tea as well.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|I must have been one of the last people to watch this quirky little charmer of a movie. It's got an off-beat sense of humour, while still capturing the essence of high school life's difficulties for the outsider geeks attending the school ND, the character, is just such a geek, and he lives in his small-town home, in a non-traditional family. During the course of the movie, he develops new friendships and a possible romantic interest, and grows enough to put himself out there, literally, for the sake of his new friend, when his friend is on the rocks. It's hard to beat loyalty like that. The off-beat humour comes from both ND's own personality quirks and sayings, and the events of the developing story. And sometimes things are just \\"out there\\".<br /><br />And there's always Tina the Llama to contemplate.<br /><br />So, check it out, you might be pleasantly surprised!
B0000AGWJ7|2.0|I love their new cd.  So when I found out that people love their older cds and don't really like their new cd, I decided to check this one out.  Now I know why no one listens to metal heads.  This album is crap.  There are a couple good songs, and they are all, not surprisingly, the ones where shadows actually sings for the most part.  You stupid metal heads say that city of evil is too poppy.  Well the reason none of your music is popular is because it all sounds the same and it all sucks.  Just like most of the songs on this cd.  Can't tell the difference.  And since city of evil is the better cd but is behind in the rating, it shows that amazon.com ratings mean absolutely nothing.  I recommend this cd to people who enjoy terrible vocals and instrumentals that don't live up to potential at all.  True talent is displayed on city of evil.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|I loved every song. It's really that simple, he's a true vocalist.<br /><br />When I first heard his songs I didn't know if I was listening to Frank Sinatra, Bobby Darin, or Harry Connick, Jr.<br /><br />Songs that standout:<br /><br />1) feeling good<br /><br />2) a foggy day<br /><br />3) you don't know me<br /><br />4) quando, quando, quando w/nelly furtado<br /><br />5) home - my favorite<br /><br />6) can't buy me love<br /><br />7) the more I see you<br /><br />8) save the last dance for me<br /><br />9) try a little tenderness<br /><br />10) how sweet it is<br /><br />11) song for you w/chris botti<br /><br />12) i've got you under my skin<br /><br />13) you and I<br /><br />OH wait, that's every song!!!

B00062ZE3U|5.0|Please, selling out is sacrificing art for money.  This cd is quite artistic, the lyrics very emotive, and you can simply hear how much time has gone into the album.  Who are we to say this isn't the sound they wanted or the direction they wished to go?  I love far too many songs on this cd, and while I'm not too familiar with their earlier work (and I can certainly say this cd made me want to do so, and I've heard some of their earlier stuff and love it as much) I see myself in no place to take a holier than thou stance and shun the album because they are exploring themselves as artist and are experimenting with other directions. <br /> <br />Musicians are people.  People mature.  Get over it and enjoy the cd for what it is, a production from talented musicians.
B000084T18|5.0|Not since Britny Spears's \\"Baby One More Time\\" has an album released that took the public imagination like this masterpiece. Originally released in 2003 and one of the biggest debut albums in hip-hop history. Being a huge MTV fan, I rarly see rappers with talent like 50 cent...arguably the greatest hip-hop artists ever. If you dont have this album then why not? Support 50 cent because he's the definition of musical genius. What more can I say than this is the greatest hip-hop album ever? Buy it and see why. Thanks MTV.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|Like everyone else has said....brilliant musicianship...kickass production.....Their rendition of hollow years,here, is to die for !!!!! but frankly ,the songset selection after New Millenium is way too dulll...where's 6:00,Under a glass moon,Peruvian Skies etc? ...Those would have made this the best DVD on earth...ever !!!!! The bonus features on disc two are awesome too......
B000B8QEYC|4.0|This is a good cd.  It's obviously similar to her other work, with a few new tunes.  The thing I love most about Enya is her haunting vocals, and the tunes are haunting too, but merge into the same sort of tunes.  There aren't any stand out songs here, but I do enjoy listening to this overall.  Nothing will ever be better than Carribean Blue and Only Time.  It's been a long time between drinks, but not quite worth it.
B0006A9FKA|2.0|Where's the comedy in this movie? I just watched this film expecting lots of humor from the so-called hero of the movie, Shaun, but found that there's absolutely no comedy in this film whatsoever. the movie starts out as an ordinary day as with all horror movies, then later the population begins to feel a bit on the coughy side, then eventually became zombies. Then, the remaining survivors - surprisingly some of the survivors are people that Shaun already knows - end up on a huge trek to survivial. They end up in a place where Shaun and his friend Ed mostly hung out, and from there, they lose most of their friends.  <br /> <br />To be honest, I found absolutely no humor in this film. But lots of gore, zombie gore. I will be fair and give it another star, rather than a 1. I'm honestly disappointed in this movie and I hate to have to throw this movie away. The zombie thingy is fine, but the comedy isn't. Try again next time and maybe I'll laugh. That is, if they even plan on making a sequel to this horrid film.

But not as big a mistake as Fox's idiotic decision to skip the pilot episode(s), Serenity, which introduced the characters and made you really care for them. That lack of insight played a big role in dooming the series to failure.  <br /> <br />The Fox execs should have stayed out of the way, and let Whedon tell his story the way he wanted to, in the order that he wanted to. <br /> <br />I wish I had discovered it earlier in its proper context, because it's one of the best science-fiction series I've ever seen.  <br /> <br />
B00005JOIF|1.0|Munich the film is as much an atrocity as Munich the terrorist massacre. It creates the impression of a moral equivalence between terrorists who slaughter innocents and those who would punish those same terrorists. It's like saying that-well-the Nazi holocaust was a bad thing, but so is hunting down and punishing the Nazis who perpetrated it. This is a particularly pernicious message in the post 9/11 world and I think a deliberate one. Second, Munich the film is stuffed full of lies. The Israeli assassination team did not spend its time wallowing in self doubt as depicting in the film. As recently as this past spring, the real head of the team stated that he was proud of what he did. He certainly did not behave as he is depicted behaving in the film. Spielberg should certainly recognize evil when he sees it; he did, after all, make Schindler's List. But when confronted with another, more modern evil, he choose to wallow in liberal guilt rather than create a clear eyed depiction of it. Spielberg is, in effect, saying that terrorism is sometime justified and that fighting against it is not. For shame
B000065BPB|4.0|after weeks of scouring the web for reviews and recommendations, i 'm very happy to have chosen the 280s. i ordered these from amazon with standard 4-5 day shipping not expecting to get them in time for xmas, got them  in 2 days... a nice xmas present to wrap for myself.    i am by no means an audiophile, but can appreciate the quality of sound and sound isolation that i get from these. i use the 280s on my computer and for my ipod. i was tired of the stock buds ill fit and muddy sound. i don't want folks in proximity to be bothered by noise emanating from my headphones and i don't want to be bothered by outside noise when i am listening to music. i've tried in-canal earphones and i just can't stand pulling those things out of my ears... a review i read equated the in-canal type of phones to pulling an octopus out of your ear. who wants that?!    i realized what i needed were sealed (covering your whole ear)  headphones. these would dampen (but not eliminate entirely) outside sound.portability obviously doesn't compare to any set of buds but i was willing to bypass that. comparable sets range from $150 and up. these were a steal on amazon.    the 280s have a clear crisp sound. i'm re-experiencing my music. they work extremely well to dampen outside noise. i can't hear someone at the door but i can hear my dogs barking! with these cans, i can get into a 'zone' quite easily. these may look a bit chunky compared to, say the bose triports, but they are lightweight and comfortable even after hours of wear.    highly recommended.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|Sigur R&oacute;s's previous two albums were truly mind-blowing and intensely beautiful albums.  \\"Takk...\\", on the other hand, plays things a little safer and a little more restrained.  Upon first listen this led me to believe this was a less impressive album, and maybe it is, but I've been listening to it incessantly over the last few months in a way I haven't done with the previous albums.  I guess I can't put myself through the emotional wringer of \\"()\\" too many times too closely together, while \\"Takk...\\" is so lovely and beguiling I sometimes just start the whole thing over again once I finish it.<br /><br />Of course, this is all relative.  This is far more intense and involving than the vast majority of pop/rock music, to be sure.  I just feel exhilarated after this, instead of steamrollered.
B0000026NC|5.0|I love this album maybe because it was the first decent CD my dad gave me...back in 1993...
B0000028M7|5.0|Two reviewer have already responded to this Melissa \\"fall out boy lover\\" girl. Unless you are some bored 15 year old who is being sarcastic like that mtv rocks girl, or you are dead serious, you are pretty damn ignorant. Alice in Chains is right up there with Soundgarden as the best grunge bands, and they destroy any other modern rock band. Green Day? Good Charlotte? Blink-182? Are you smoking the chronic? I have read your 4 reviews, and you should re-consider your music tastes. First you say Slayer's \\"Reign In Blood\\" is bad, then take shots at Pantera, Megadeth and Metallica, then Alice in Chains. What the hell is wrong with you and every other 16 year old girl who hasn't stopped watching MTV? <br /> <br />Oh yeah, Dirt is the best grunge album, tied with Jar of Flies as Chains' best album and wipes the floor with modern bands like Godsmack, Puddle of Mudd and Creed. This is highly underrated amongst grunge fans everywhere, who say Nirvana and Pearl Jam were better. Nirvana was okay, and Pearl Jam is terribly overrated. Alice in Chains and Soundgarden were clearly the pinnacle of Seattle grunge and defined 90's rock. If only the kids these days would listen to this and appreciate it, unlike that Melissa... <br /> <br />First is \\"Them Bones\\", the dark intro to Dirt, is one of Alice in Chains' best song. It's dark, heavy and really defines what type of band and album this is going to be. Following is \\"Dam That River\\", which is somewhat like Them Bones, heavy and dark. \\"Rain When I Die\\" is a six minute epic which is slower but still good. \\"Down In A Hole\\" is a depressing, bleak song but is one of their greatest hits. \\"Sickman\\" is another bleak and heavy song about lead singer Layne Staley, another great song. \\"Rooster\\", another classic, is an ode to guitarist Jerry Cantrell's father who fought in Vietnam. The next three songs, \\"Junkhead\\", \\"Dirt\\" and \\"God Smack\\" basically describe the horrors of Layne Staley, his drug addiction and his death wish. Very depressing, butstill great nontheless. <br /> <br />After the 43 second mysterious intro of screaming, the next is \\"Hate To Feel\\", a descent song, but not that memorable but still a great song. The final two songs, \\"Angry Chair\\" and \\"Would?\\", wrap up the album. These two songs are definately in the top ten of the best Alice In Chains songs of all-time. \\"Would?\\" is probably in the top 5. This whole album is definately one of the best of all-time. <br /> <br />If you are just discovering Alice in Chains, start out with this album and their debut \\"Facelift\\". Then get their two EP's and their 1995 self-titled. You will not be disappointed by anything, because this is definately one of the greatest bands ever. RIP Layne Staley. If only wou were alive to see what the music world is today, you would of definately shaped it up and made a difference.
B00005JO17|3.0|`Chicken Little' is Disney's first full-CGI animation without Pixar's name. This means the film is the first in-house 100 % CGI product from the company, and this fact alone makes our expectation unusually high. And it is inevitable that you compare it with such films as `Monsters Inc' and `Finding Nemo' that Pixar gave us in the past. <br /> <br />This is my impression. Technically and visually `Chicken Little' is impressive if not groundbreaking. That much I can promise. But Pixar is going to set the stake higher in 2006 with their new animated film, so Disney might be fated to fall behind in this arena for the next few years, or possibly decade. Is Disney going to really abandon the traditional hand-drawn animated pictures in the future? I don't think it is a wise decision. <br /> <br />[YOU DON'T FIND A STORY] In `Chicken Little' which starts with an episode based on the extended version of the famous fable, titular Chicken Little creates a great havoc by warning the townspeople that, you know, the sky is falling. And ... the story is relegated to the sidelines, becoming the usual pattern of a loser (and the loser's friends, who are also losers) winning in the end after misadventures. There is a story about father-son relation. There is an alien invasion. There are lots of pop-culture references, (which include very recent hits like `King Kong' and `War of the Worlds'). But if you want the social satire of `The Incredibles' or the touching moment of `Toy Story 2,' you will be disappointed. Compared with `Chicken Little,' stories of `Robots' or `Madagascar' start to look better, or at least coherent. <br /> <br />But the strength of `Chicken Little' lies in sight gags. The film is better when it doesn't speak, and the wacky humor based on exaggerated slapstick gags would make you smile. The voice actors are all good, including Zach Braff, Garry Marshall, Joan Cusack, Steve Zahn, Amy Sedaris, Don Knotts, Harry Shearer, Patrick Stewart, and Wallace Shawn. Thanks tothem, the characters provide funny moments. But most of those funny scenes would be funny from the beginning without the main story about Little Chicken and his predicament.  <br /> <br />Mark Dindal, who directed much superior `The Emperor's New Groove' five years ago, throws many sight gags in the style of old-fashioned animations - like Tex Avery's in which characters don't jump, but fly - but I think CGI techniques are not suitable to this kind of gags. `Chicken Little' is not bad - it is enjoyable as long as you ignore the weak story. I enjoyed watching it, but do not think that I will own its DVD.
B000002UAR|5.0|With some Beatle albums, either John or Paul or both together might deliver a weak song in the mix, but not here.  Every John and Paul song is wonderful- they both present us with brilliance and they balance out nicely.  Paul's sugary songs are countered with some edgy ones from Lennon and they work together wonderfully.  This is a very playful and joyous album- \\"Good Day Sunshine,\\" \\"And Your Bird can Sing,\\" \\"Yellow Submarine\\" \\"Dr. Robert\\" \\"I'm only Sleeping\\" and \\"Taxman\\" are a lot of fun. <br /> <br />The weak spots are the two other songs from George which are a bit dull.  Paul's songs here show depth and John's songs like \\"She Said She Said\\" and \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" are a revelation.  Both John and Paul wrote better songs than any that are on the album, but they still are so consistently great on this album, it is considered one of the best.
B000A5044C|5.0|I hadn't heard of this movie before, and only rented it on a whim because the cover blurb interested me.  I didn't expect it to be so emotionally draining-- I watched it yesterday, but I still feel like I might cry just thinking about it!-- but this is definitely one I'll watch again, and one I would like to own. <br />This seems at first the story of a loving, if selfish and immature mother. . . sure, she raises her family in an unconventional way, but they seem to be a close-knit, generally happy bunch.  They even seem fine at first when she leaves them alone with nothing but a note and an envelope of money, but the money starts to run out, and Akira is forced to borrow from his siblings' fathers to keep afloat.  When their mother does return, there seems to be a hint of resentment, especially from the older children. <br />Then we find out just how selfish she can be, as their mother leaves her job and children outright to be with a man.  She doesn't even tell them what she's doing-- Akira finds out by calling around to check up on her.  I don't think he actually tells his siblings where she's run off to, but Kyoko, at least, seems to know they've been abandoned from fairly early on.  She tries to shelter the others with promises their mother will return, but even they become more doubtful as time goes by. <br />Akira does an admirable job of holding the household together at first, but goes through his own selfish period when he befriends some schoolboys, and spends more time playing games with them than caring for the home and his siblings.  By the time he learns their true nature and returns to his home life, the place is in squallor and the utilities are all being turned off.  Though their living situation gets worse all the time, surprisingly, the children remain close, and pull together to survive as best they can. <br />The fact these children are all amateurs makes their acting in this film all the more amazing-- they can convey more emotion in a glance than many Western actors can in a page full of dialogue.  I felt connected to these children, and concerned for their well-being, more than any other movie characters I can think of.  The adults who seemed to see the situation, yet did nothing to help, infuriated me!  Even just the passers-by who saw a group of poor, dirty children in the street yet didn't stop to help, or even question why, made me angry.  For all the concern of what might happen if anyone saw them, these children seemed pretty much invisible most of the time. <br />The ending is incomplete, yes.  We never know whether their mother comes back, or whether social services step in at any point.  The lack of resolution is mildly annoying, but it also leaves one with the impression that these children are still out there, still doing whatever it takes to survive and stay together.  That's the sort of movie this is; salvaging hope from even the darkest and most dire situations.
B000002UAO|5.0|This is the album where John Lennon changed the direction of the Beatles.  His \\"Nowhere Man\\" was the first Beatle song that didn't include love for a girl and it showed they could write something apart from being in love.  This would have big repercussions as they then strayed from the formula and Paul answered with \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" which is a bit like \\"Nowhere Man\\" in the fact Rigby is like a \\"Nowhere Woman.\\"  John had grown tired of writing songs just about love and wanted the Beatles to progress out of that.  He was also tired of writing songs that were created just to be commercially liked.  He would rarely write again just to have a commercial hit.  He was more focused on writing something that meant something instead of topping the charts, although he thought many of them should have been released as A-sides to singles even though he did not write them to be commercial hits. He was demanding a lot from his audience and refused to insult their intelligence anymore with songs that had no substance to it.  He wanted the audience to change how they thought a \\"single\\" should be instead of pandering to them with commercial music. <br /> <br />Paul delivers some good songs on this album but Lennon's childhood friend, Pete Shotten, said that McCartney was resisting the idea of forsaking commercial music and wanted to stay \\"middle of the road\\" during this time, as witnessed by the fact that all his songs were still about love on this album, although he was eventually won over to the merit of it and took up the challenge on Revolver.  John also allowed a sitar on \\"Norwegian Wood,\\" an instrument unheard of in the pop music of the day.  Harrison started to put the sitar in many of his songs after \\"Norwegian Wood.\\" <br /> <br />Paul and John both created some great music on this CD. This was the turning point for them and they would never look back.
B00005JMFQ|2.0|and thought the movie was interesting and entertaining.  And it contained many favorite actors.  Then I read an online review about the vulgar sights, scene and sayings that had been removed from the version I watched.  How disappointing.  This movie stood on its own WITHOUT tons of nudity or language.  I also didn't realize the foul language used by the Liam Neeson character in talking with his stepson.  Watch a cleaned up version if you can.
B000002UDB|5.0|For the film, McCartney's songwriting is slipping a little in this period, though he will regain it again strong with the White Album.  He is writing too many weak songs thinking they are great such as \\"Your Mother Should Know,\\"  \\"Magical Mystery Tour,\\" and the vapid yet commercial \\"Hello Goodbye,\\"- which was a big hit but meaningless and did nothing to progress the group except to deliver another number one song, which they hardly needed.  \\"Hello Goodbye\\" is a bit of an embarrassment today.  Even his best song, \\"Fool on the Hill\\" is mediocre in relation to his actual talent.  Lennon singlehandedly saves the film soundtrack from scorn with his brilliant \\"I am The Walrus,\\" the best song in the film and a work of genius.  \\"Blue Jay Way\\" is one of the worst songs Harrison wrote and drones on for what seems like forever. <br /> <br />The other side has the great Beatles singles on it.  \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" is a classic and is often listed as one of the greatest songs ever written.  The poetic images and the beautiful melody are each in it's own right praised apart from the other- it's an astonishing song.  \\"Penny Lane\\" is one of Paul's best although it has not aged that well and seems a bit silly today.  \\"All You Need is Love\\" is anthem and the title was recently voted the greatest phrase of all time by the British beating out Shakespeare and the Bible.  Musically, though, it is also a bit dated.  \\"Baby, You're a Rich Man\\" has John's beautiful verse music marred by Paul's dull chorus part. <br /> <br />Even with all the little criticisms, it has some of the greatest songs in all of music on the album and well worth buying.

B000002UAX|5.0|John Lennon was embarrassed by the failure of \\"Magical Mystery Tour.\\" The early driving force behind the Beatles, Lennon had been content to sit back and let the Beatles all together go forward- but only if that meant success.  With the failure of the \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" film, Lennon decided to reassert himself and wrote like mad to keep the vaudeville to a minimum.  He succeeded on a grand level with classics as diverse as \\"Dear Prudence,\\" \\"Happiness is a Warm Gun,\\" \\"I'm So Tired,\\" \\"Julia,\\" \\"Sexy Sadie\\" \\"Revolution\\" and the infamous \\"Revolution #9.\\" <br /> <br />Paul, whose songwriting had dipped a bit on \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" with lightweight songs such as \\"Your Mother Should Know\\" and the hollow but commercial \\"Hello Goodbye\\" delivers some strong material here as well, with \\"Back in the USSR,\\" \\"Blackbird,\\" and \\"Helter Skelter.\\"  He also delivered a massive hit with \\"Hey, Jude' at the time not included on the album but that was commercial but unlike \\"Hello Goodbye,\\" full of meaning and brilliance.  He was still struggling a bit here, presenting more fluff like \\"Honey Pie\\" and \\"Why Don't We Do it the Road,\\" but other songs make up for it. <br /> <br />George Harrison was an angry man around this time and his songwriting was all the better for it.  \\"Not Guilty\\" was one of his best songs but since it was aimed right at Lennon/McCartney, it perhaps may be the reason it ended up on the cutting room floor.  But Harrison was fired up and it showed, he delivers some wonderful stuff here.  \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" may be the best song on the album. <br /> <br />It's a bit of a myth they were not working together and that the songs are by the writer's alone.  In fact, Lennon and McCartney did work together on some of the songs.  McCartney helped with the lyrics to \\"Glass Onion,\\" Lennon said he gave a line in \\"Blackbird\\" to mcCartney and gave a line to George in \\"Piggies\\" and he said he might have helped some on \\"Ob La Di\\" although he hated it afterward and there is tape of Paul talking about he and John trying to come up with lyrics for \\"I Will,\\" so they were not TOTALLY apart.  Harrison also said he and Ringo were the ones who looked through the boxes and got the tapes for \\"Revolution #9.\\" <br /> <br />The tension was with Yoko Ono being there.  Paul is quoted as saying he felt uncomfortable going to write with John because Yoko was always with him and he felt embarrassed if he did not have something clever or avant-garde to present in front of her- so instead, he backed away. <br /> <br />Regardless, all three men presented some incredible songs and this album is a classic and hallmark of the Beatles.
B00005JO1P|5.0|I just got out of the theater about an hour ago...and I'm still shocked. How on Earth? This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Absolutely amazing in every aspect. Nothing could've been better. Everything, from the casting of Shooter Jennings as Waylon Jennings, to the Oscar-worthy performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, is absolutely exceptional in this movie. This beats Jamie Foxx's \\"Ray\\" by a lot.     Joaquin Phoenix brilliantly portrays the troubled Johnny Cash, in such a way that you feel for Mr.Cash. It makes you want to jump onto the screen, and throw Johnny's pill bottles away. Reese Witherspoon (though she is considerably prettier than June Carter was) does a wonderful job at her part. One of the most impressive things these two people did, was actually sing in the movie! Most actors who have to play rock stars have the music dubbed in, and just hope they can lip it well enough to look convincing. Well, I'm convinced. The singing sounded great, and I, being a music/movie obsessive and a Texas Pre-Area Bass 2, would know. Johnny Cash is pretty much the only country I listen to, him and Hank Williams, with an occasional Buck Owens tune.     I loved this movie. Oh, and how about a shout out to the rest of the cast! The two men playing Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley were hilarious, and the men playing Johnny Cash's \\"Two Tennessee Men\\" were great.     This movie beats Narnia, King Kong, and any other movie I've seen this year, and almost my whole near-15 years of existence. If you haven't seen it already, get up from reading this review, walk out of your door, get in your car, drive to the theater, and watch it. It's brilliant.
0156029065|2.0|This book contains an interesting, but never really captivating story. All concepts that make this book worth reading are already present in the first third of the book. Subsequent developments are in line with the story, but I felt little value was added for most of the middle part of the book. Only in the very end, the pace picks up again into a dramatic conclusion. <br /> <br />If the book had been one third the size, I would have enjoyed reading it to the end. Now it just felt like a burden to complete it.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|I'm young, but I know so much about the Beatles...well, it probably isn't healthy. They are my all time favorite band, and I assume that they always will be. This album is a good CD for a casual fan or just a person who wants a bunch of Beatles songs for a small price, but if you're an avid fan, get the Anthology discs.  <br /> <br />The Beatles are, without a doubt, the most influential rock band of all time. I don't need to drill that into your head anymore that it usually is. The Lennon/Mccartney song writing team was huge...they were the greats. No song will ever beat Mccartney immortal \\"Hey Jude\\", and nothing is more musically intellectual than Lennon's \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\". Call them a teeny-bopper band, call them dead legends, call them phonies, call them washed-up hacks who didn't deserve their fame...call them whatever, you can be as bitter about it as you want to be. But the truth is, for some strange reason their music has had more impact than probably anyone else's.  <br /> <br />Alright, enough ranting, now to this album. This album is perfectly fine. Of course there are great songs on it, it is the Beatles after all, but I personally would go for the Anthology discs. This CD has their #1 hits in the UK and US, which are great, but not all my favorites. The remastering of the tracks sounds phenomenal, especially on \\"Hey Jude\\", \\"Get Back\\", and \\"Let it Be\\". <br /> <br />It's a good CD for a casual fan, so if you're a newcomer to Beatlemania, check it out!
B000A32KJQ|5.0|This cd is highly enjoyable. It's not a usual ECM record I can say. It's a little bit easier harmonically in a sense, but meantime it's still of very high artistic value. It is a very balanced recording. It's at the same time deep and fresh music. You can listen to it accurately or you can loop it in the background and be really happy with it. Stanko and Garbarek form a very interesting horn duo. Katch&eacute; is a light drummer, his playing is modern, very sensitive and accurate. He has a really nice touch on the drum set. As I keep listening to this album again and again I still find it quite different from the common ECM catalogue (I mean the chamber music they often publish). It is light and intriguing, a little more bouncing, rhytmic music. Of course it depends from the fact that it has a drummer as the leader, I don't know. Anyway it is a very nice record for the connossoir but for the novice too. I mean that I feel to suggest it even to those unfamiliar with Jazz because it's a very easy listening in my opinion. So if you jazz novices want to buy a nice jazz cd to appear sophisticated when friends come to visit you this could be the one. Stanko does some exceptional trumpet playing over some quite urban, sophisticated, light tunes. I appreciated Katche&eacute;'s playing very much and Wasilewski piano playing too. The ensembe is very unique, coherent and they complement each other perfectly.
B00005JO04|4.0|Having been sold the pitch of \\"Peak Oil\\" by those many who imply there will have to be a dieoff of humanity by the billion, I heard tell of this film, which supposedly shows the desperation of the world for what's left of the petroleum and gas. <br /> <br />But I simply could not follow the story.  It went all over the place, and after a certain while, I just gave up, to get into the fine international tableaux, and further enlightenment into what Islam might truly be about. <br /> <br />I probably could have picked something easier to figure out, and had a better time.  My rating is 3.5 stars for this one, which rounds up to 4.
B00000373U|5.0|I started listening to Elliott Smith at a fairly young age, and although I couldn't understand the full measure of his ordinarily heavier lyrics I enjoyed the simplistic guitar that was well complimented by his airy, whimsical voice. Either/Or is a far less accessable album, compared to the ones where he was being produced by Dreamworks, but it strikes a chord in everyone that's ever gone through the awkward, sweet, and tragic romances Elliott Smith seems to have mastered penning. Although most of the songs on the album are well crafted, the deft strumming in Angeles, the raw lyrics of Between the Bars, and the bitter-sweet sound of Say Yes all stuck out the most for me. Elliott Smith's voice has the amazing ability to make it seem like his singing is necessity, and his voice is so earnest, you believe every word he's saying. Now that I'm a bit older I find that I can appreciate every aspect of Elliott Smith's songs. In Either/Or every song has achieved the indie-artist dream, that beautiful melancholy that we all relate to but can so rarely put into words. Smith pulls it off here with ease.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|If anything would prove that most films based on comic book or computer game characters are rarely worth a jot of concentration, this one should.  This film is terrible on every level - wooden acting, silly stunts that are obviously computer-enhanced, and the most flaccid plot you could imagine, just pure formula garbage.  The worst.<br /><br />Don't bother, unless you want to vegatate and wallow in mindless pap.  There is nothing to recommend this film, not even you-know-who's computer exaggerated chest.
B000092ZYX|4.0|The voices on this recording are strange. The rythems seem to produce another Kid A, but the guitars are for instance always around in order to make an impression. This is not simple rock music. After a few times listening to this you will appreciate this more or you will not. Some songs even I do not like, four stars In my opinion 1, 5 and 6 and 11 are great.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Fantastic movie.  Great plot, not too scary for kids, not too boring for adults.  A major step forward in animation with the fur.  Be sure to check the outtakes/blooper reel on the DVD.  I do wish they would have had play all for the special features. <br />I just got this for Christmas - it is 4 years old and seems to be holding up well.  Buy it! <br />
B000BMSTMS|5.0|I have been listening to this album non-stop for the last two weeks and I have to say that the majority of the songs on this album are what any fan of any band would hope they would be. If you liked the old Korn, you're going to like the new Korn. That's just the way it is.  <br /> <br />Best songs on this album are \\"Hypocrites\\", \\"Throw Me Away\\", \\"Last Legal Drug\\" (Extended Version), and \\"Liar\\" <br /> <br />The best song hands down is \\"Love Song\\". Once again Johnathan Davis has transferred his memories and pain into a really unbelievably good song.  <br /> <br />No kidding folks, I can push play and let it roll through most of the CD before feeling the need to skip a track. It's that good. <br /> <br />Bottom line is this.. if you own any other Korn CD and you have listened to it more than once, if you are a long time fan, if you are a new listener, then you have to have this one.
B00005KB9W|4.0|Bob Marley was making critical waves but not until the release of \\"Live\\" in 1975 did he also break through commercially.<br /><br />\\"Live\\" (8 tracks, 45 min.) was re-released in 2001 with a remastered sound and one bonus track. The energy is bustling throughout, starting with the opener \\"Trenchtown Rock\\". The band is in top form throughout. This album of course includes the mega-hit \\"No Woman, No Cry\\", released as a single and enormously successful. But there are some other great jems, such as \\"Them Belly Full (But We Hungry)\\" and \\"Get Up, Stand Up\\". The bonus track, not found on the original (vinyl) album, is an equally outstanding \\"Kinky Reggae\\".<br /><br />It is obvious that this is a milestone album in the Markey catalogue. But I still have to wonder why, to this day, the entire show of this legendary London July, 1975 concert hasn't been released. And in my book (which is of course a subjective feeling), the 1978 live album \\"Babylon By Bus\\" is even better.
0670033375|3.0|This is certainly an important book, for the subject should have our urgent attention, and the treatment given it here by Jared Diamond is broad and deep enough for an interested lay reader. Unfortunately, it is not a good book although it is a compendium of useful information and worth reading if you can force yourself through it.<br /><br />The book suffers from the failures one finds in word-processed manuscripts that have become too big for their authors' memories and that were nevertheless rushed into print without editing. The quality if variable, and some sections are quite good; perhaps the historically oldest chapters that have benefited from a larger share of the author's time. But in many places sentences and paragraphs wind about, carrying a burden of meta-dialogue that is characteristic of stream-of-consciousness writing, but that does not help the clarity and structure of the arguments, a tendency which gets worse towards the end of the book. This gives the reader a sense of a big ambitious work just running out of steam; turning into a let down.<br /><br />There are other problems.

B000AA4M9U|4.0|B.B. King gives the ultimate birthday present on his 80th birthday both to himself and to the fans: a new studio album that is a star-studded affair, which not surprisingly has its ups and downs.<br /><br />\\"80\\" (12 tracks, 54 min.) matches up the living blues legend with a bunch of stars, including Van Morrison, Eric Clapton, Sheryl Crow, John Mayer, Roger Daltrey, Elton John, and many others. The album is generally a pick-and-choose affair. The best tracks for me are \\"Hummingbird\\", where John Mayer foreshadows his release shortly after this one of \\"Try!\\" by the John Mayer Trio (a guilty pleasure for me); \\"All Over Again\\" with delicious guitar duets between B.B. King and Mark Knopfler; \\"Never Make Your Move Too Soon\\" with Roger Daltrey in great form; and the closer \\"Rock This House\\", a rousing live track with Elton John. There are a couple of real duds too, unfortunately, including \\"The Thrill Is Gone\\" with Eric Clapton, how can 2 such legends sounds so lame, and, the worst of all, the 7 min. duet with Gloria Estefan, what in the world is she doing on a blues album?!?<br /><br />All that aside, I am simply amazed by the continuing energy of B.B. King, who continues also to tour regularly. I only hope that when I reach 80 in 35 years, I have half the stamina of this truly living legend and American treasure. \\"80\\" may be a mixed affair, but there are enough good moments to make this a worthwhile addition to your B.B. King collection.
6304708521|1.0|This review is for anybody who enjoyed Yellow Submarine, A Hard Days' Night, or even Help! and is thinking that this would be a good, enjoyable follow up.  <br /> <br />Think again. The most egregious mis-step in the Beatles' career, this thing is, despite sporadic musical brilliance, an interminable mish-mash of stagey home movies, pretentious avant-garde hoo-ha (wrestling midgets! Chroma-key effects! Strippers!), and badly-acted skits.  The boys themselves, impossibly far from the fresh-faced naifs of A Hard Day's Night from just three years earlier, seem alternately bored (or, more likely, simply stoned beyond caring) and insufferably smug.  <br /> <br />Others have commented on the terrible video quality, which is an artifact of the project's origin as a TV special using early portable color equipment, but it's the content that makes it truly unwatchable.   <br /> <br />For the casual fan, this is simply a waste of time and money; any of the other Beatles movies or the CD soundtrack (or any other Fabs album for that matter) would be a more worthwhile investment.  For the budding Beatlemaniac, note that almost all the worthwhile bits from this film are included in the Anthology DVD set, including the proto-videos for \\"I Am the Walrus\\" and \\"Your Mother Should Know\\" (The other musical highlight is the instrumental \\"Flying\\", but the visuals here are nothing but tinted landscapes, so buy the CD and close your eyes and you won't have missed anything); far better to put your money towards a copy of Anthology than suffer through the drek here to get to the songs.  That leaves Beatles completists, who most likely have this already (and for whom issues such as watchability are beside the point).  You already know if you are a completist and don't care about this or any other review; if you aren't one, however, don't say you weren't warned! <br /> <br /> <br />
0060920084|1.0|This is another book by a smug expatriate making facile criticisms about life in America.  He does this with a fraction of the wit of Paul Theroux. The book is about a road trip he makes across the United States after living many years in England.  The problem is, he sticks to long stretches of interstate highway venturing off rarely for a tourist attraction, lodging or food.  He then laments the boring stretches of highway, the fastfood (which he always seems to eat) and the motel rooms.  He rarely talks to any people except those that work in the aforementioned establishments.  He comes off as the fat, ignorant, small-minded and cheap midwestern American that he attempts to label everyone else. He travels to National Parks but doe not venture far from the parking lots.  His trip is my idea of a nightmare:  logging endless miles trying to hit as many states as possible, seeking out the well-received stereotypes for each area. His father whom he tries to belittle comes off as helluva guy, less smallminded than his son turned out to be.
0312995423|5.0|Dan Brown has lived up to his reputation with Digital Fortress. This phenomenal book contains sharp plot twists that keep you guessing. The plot takes an entire reversal from the start to the end. The thrills that main characters, Susan Fletcher and her boyfriend, David Becker, go through are not ordinary. With David running through Spain searching for a ring and Susan trying to protect her life in Crypto the excitement in this book is never ending. <br /> <br /> I recommend this book to anyone who had enjoyed his other books, Angels and Demons, The Da Vinci Code, and Deception Point. Also if you have read and liked the Pendragon Series by D.J. MacHale or Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card you will adore reading this book. And for those of you who have an interest in cryptology, code-breaking, you will definitely find this book all the more enjoying.  <br /> <br />Note: This is a student review
B000BEZQ18|5.0|I adore this CD.  It is gorgeous music, so well done.  And if you have seen the film, it will have you bawling all over again, especially during Gustavo Santaolalla's music. <br /> <br />This CD is missing one of the most beautiful songs in the movie, however:  Rick Garcia's hauntingly gorgeous rendition of \\"Quizas, Quizas, Quizas\\" by Osvaldo Farres.  I am grief-stricken that this was left off of the \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" soundtrack.  To me, it was the most beautiful version of this song I have ever heard, and it set a stunning scene as Jack Twist strolled through the mysterious nighttime streets of Juarez, Mexico. <br /> <br />Fans of the movie will not be disappointed with the other songs, though.  The CD is worth the price for \\"No One's Gonna Love You Like Me\\" and Willie Nelson's rendition of \\"He Was A Friend of Mine\\" alone.  Bravo to all involved.  But if a new CD is issued, please add \\"Quizas Quizas Quizas\\"!
B00070Q7VO|5.0|I am a new fan of Michale Buble, having discovered his wonderful voice wafting at me from the annual local public TV telethon special. As I was passing by the TV, his voice made me stop and want to listen to more. His on stage personae is infectious and personal-I wished I was sitting in the audience. Then I heard the song \\"Home\\" and I was hooked. His voice rolls over you like butter-rich and resonant. His on stage personality greets you like a friend-how did someone so young learn to reel an audience in like that? If you need a quick fix of his music, go to his website [...] and it will load full songs (a few) so you can get a more full appreciation for the songs. I am hoping this CD is under the tree for me at Christmas. If not, it is going to be ordered the day after.
B000BTJDGC|3.0|I am an Occult Scientist. This film although admits the necessary permission from the Catholic Church for an Exorcism however it does not not show that the other members as well as the Priest must receive confession.This film shows some of the horror that someone that a posessed person and her/his family under demonic possession  must goes through. However this is a great film showing the the fortitude of the Defense Attorney who stands by the priest who has perfomed the Exocism  must deal with and its aftermath.Excellent for us Law students.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Serenity is the miracle movie of 2005. It shouldn't have been made, as Joss Whedon himself believes, and yet its sitting on my entertainment center waiting for me to watch it whenever the mood strikes me. I laughed, I cried, I fell down...everything necessary for me to enjoy a movie. <br />   <br />  The sequence where we are introduced to the crew of Serenity is brilliant, and it just gets better. There are minor discrepencies, such as how do River and Simon end up in the same bar as the rest of the crew after they have separated, but otherwise the plot flowed smoothly. <br />   <br />  While there are some questions that people may have regarding things that those of us who have seen the television episodes already know, I think that for the most part it can stand alone. On the plus side, the questions people may have on the background on some of the story lines can only lead to more sales for the series DVDs. And for those of you who haven't already, you should check out the score, its pretty fantastic and well put together. <br /> <br />
B000BB1MI2|4.0|I found this movie far better than the 1971 version, mainly because of Depp's performance, which was strange yet intriguing. I don't quite think he was going for Michael Jackson; rather, I find Depp's Wonka to be far closer to Dahl's original portrayal from the novels.<br /><br />Also upstanding were the performances by the children, which were far more interesting than their counterparts in the earlier film(with the sole exception of the Veruca Salt character, who was better before).
B00005JN2Z|4.0|I was skeptical about this movie, I mean Tom Cruise as a grey headed assassin and I thought of Jamie Fox as a comedian, but when I saw  this movie last year I was really taken aback.  The movie is well paced and Cruise is in rare form, Fox does a nice job, but this is Cruise's movie and he is very good, expecially when things start to go wrong, his character is riviting.  My only qualms are the movie is a bit long and I really did not buy Jada Pincket being into Jamie Fox, that really is a stretch, uh in real live or film quite frankly.  Having said that I would still recommend this movie, when it good, it's really good and that's  worth the price of the DVD, plus the extra's are nice.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I do not claim to be an expert on WWII, but I have been deeply interested in WWII since childhood, and hearing the stories passed on by my Grandfather, a veteran of the war. There is not much I can add that has not been stated in previous reviews. But, of all the footage and documentaries I have seen through the years, I have never seen a more stunning piece of work !!! A true masterpiece !! I only wish I had purchased it years earlier. Don't let the price tag scare you. It is, without a doubt, worth every penny !! If you have any kind of interest in WWII, this is a must. I can't see it being topped in any near future. On a final note, the replay value is very high, which makes it well worth the money. You will appreciate the detail each and every time you view it, I know I do.
0792165020|5.0|This is a great movie, well acted and well directed.  Though I must admit that the first half is a bit stronger than, second half.  Matt Damon is very good as Ripley, but Jude Law is a revelation as Dickie Greenleaf, he owns the part and steals the movie.  This DVD has some nice extras, I especially liked  Mingella's talking about the movie, he really researched Highsmith's book, and made it own.  Gabrial Yared's score is first rate, it's haunting and it really fuels the movie.  I highly recommend this DVD, the movie really stays with you.
B00082IJ08|5.0|as pretty much every reviewer before me stated, DD takes some getting used to. I fell in love with \\"Feel Good Inc.\\" the first time I heard it, so I knew I had to get the album, and it is, in one word, spectacular.     I don't own, nor have I ever owned, the first Gorillaz album, so I really didn't have any idea what the concept was, after many listens, I have been able to come up with a rough story, for me, the album represents the events from the end of the world (last living souls) to society outbreak (Feel Good Inc.)and ultimatly rebuilding of civilization (Demon Days)    Now I'm willing to bet this is just me, I'm the kind of person who would obsess over finding hidden meanings in Beatles songs, I nearly believed Paul was dead, I still believe Hotel California is about devil worship, so yeah, give me any Beatles song, and I can insanely break it down, Maxwells Silver Hammer, comentary on murder at the time, and the corrupt justice system, um, Yellow Submarine, metaphore for dying and going to heaven (sea of green) I am the walrus, metaphore for death, and rebirth, yeah, thats the kind of person I am.    So, yeah, I see an apoclyptic nature in the first five tracks (especsially in Last Living Souls, for obvious reassons, and Dirty Harry, which for some reasson feels kind of like Road Warriors) and tracks 6-end feel to me like redemtion of society.     but really, aside from all the hidden messages I see, theres some mighty fine music here, Beatles played Beatles music, Pink Flyod played Pink Flyod music, The Stones played Stones music, and Gorillaz play Gorillaz music, its simply a genre all their own, the only songs I really don't like are the last four, I find Dare over-rated, Monkey's Head is simply to weird for me, and I'm the kind of guy who understands \\"within you without you\\" and the last two preachy songs feel very out of place in an otherwise stellar album, the best of 2005, it isn't often we get this kind of music, but in my view, Demon Days could verywell be the \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" of the 21st century.
B000BOH8XW|2.0|I bought this album because of \\"Don't Bother.\\" Yes, it is the best song on the album. The rest of the songs are hardly exciting. Her lyrics are excellent, but musically, nothing really stands out. In other words, if you are wondering if you should buy this album, take a hint from the first release from this album- Don't bother.
B000002UB3|5.0|concept album, its an interesting sort of music genre, we've all listened to our share, Dark side of the Moon, Hotel Cali. ect. but this is not only the father of all concept albums, its the best, infact, just look at the title of this review. <br /> <br />After the utterly riggerous Get Back sessions, the fabs knew they were on their way out, however, they did pull together to develop one last masterpiece, and the term \\"save the best for last\\" is in full play here. Everything, and I mean everything, is on a grand scale on this masterpiece, it has the production values of a hollywood epic, it contains some of the best songs ever reccorded, it boasts a huge variety, from childrens ditties to hard core rock anthems to somber love poems, this album has it all. <br /> <br />I could spend this review explaining all the songs, but I won't since I am terrible at song lists, but lets just say this, you won't reccognize any of the songs if this is your first go, maybe Come Together and Something, but thats about it, give this your complete and undivided attention, for at least one listen. <br /> <br />the first half of the album isn't really concept, but it does have the classics, Come Together, Lennon's hardcore rock anthem for peace, Something, George's ballad of love, Maxwell's Silver Hammer, the delightfully quirky, twisted tale of a lunatic running around town killing people with a mallet, Oh Darling, Paul's rock ballad, Octopus's Garden, another nautical themed Ringo song, and perhaps one of the most controversial Beatles songs ever, I Want you (She's so Heavy)  <br /> <br />this epic song is nearly eight minutes long, it fades in and out of reality, if you've got eight minutes, give this a go, trust me, its hard rock at its finest. Then once the bursts of guitar filter away, after seven and a half minutes, my favorite song ever starts. <br /> <br />Here Comes the Sun, this is simply an amazing acheivement, it has so simple of a message, such a simple chorus, that youalmost forget exactly how beautiful it is, well, once it grows on you, whenever you are upset, just turn this on, it will put a light in your heart, its simply my favorite song ever, enough said. <br /> <br />Now we enter the concept album, starting with \\"Because\\" this 'trippy' song synchs all the fabs vocals into seemingly one voice, its my least favorite, but its still pretty cool. Now we get to \\"Never gives me my Money\\" which is just an extrodinary tell-a-tale song, its really the perfect deffinition of sixties lifestyle <br />\\"out of collage money spent, see now future, pay no rent, all my moneys gone nowhere to go, but oh that magic feeling, nowhere to go\\" although I do feel its kind of pushing it with the un-nerving chant at the end \\"1-2-3-4-5-6-7 all good children go to heaven\\" but still, its brilliant storytelling. <br />\\"Sun King\\" is my least favorite song on the album, I never liked it, a rare miss. <br />now we enter the grande finale, about 10 minutes of pure rock bliss, the playfulness of \\"Mean Mr. Mustard\\" the acid rock of \\"Polythene Pam\\" the tenderness of \\"Golden Slumbers\\" and the inspirational \\"Carry that Weight\\" all leading up to the biggest \\"end\\" of any album ever. <br />\\"The End\\" can only be described as a minute and a half of pure rock bliss, its basically the fabs last bow, and they go out in grand style, all four seemingly compete with themselves in shouting \\"love you, love you\\" over and over, its bliss, Ringo delivers his best drum solo of his Beatle years in this song, and the final verse \\"and in the end, the love you make, is equal to the love you make\\" is by all my means the best explenation of the meaning of life that we have.  <br />and on top of all that brilliance we've got the barely minute long bouncy poem \\"her majesty\\" while nice, \\"The End\\" should of been, well, the end, but still, fantastic reccord, if you haven't had the pleasure of listening to this, and my review hasn't convinced you, go out and buy it, it will change your life.
0156027321|5.0|This is truly one of the best books I have read in a very long time.  Though the subject matter may lead people to think that it is a children's book, this simply is not so.  It's an excellent story for anyone, and though it is written from the viewpoint of a child, the narrator has wisdom far beyond his years.  The character voice is excellent, and Yann Martel's voice as a writer is so likeable that his observations on most everything can bring a smile. <br /> <br />People claiming that the book is 'boring' or 'pointless' need to wrap their head around something called extended metaphor.  The book makes interesting and understated observations on survival and religion.  Just because it doesn't beat you over the head with its message at the end, doesn't mean it lacks one.  A well conceived and spiritual book disguised a fairy tale.  Highly recommended.
B000002UA9|2.0|one, two, three, FOUR!!!! <br /> <br />these four historical lines are found at the very beggining of the very first song of the fab fours very first US album, and odly enough, they are located on one of the only great songs on the album, basically, we've got ALOT of covers (which is forgivable when you've got John screaming his lungs out on a glorious \\"Twist and Shout\\" ) you've got two of the best loved early Beatles songs, Please Please me and Love me do, which hold up nicely. You've got a couple fairly good, but forgettable Lennon McCartney songs, and thats about it, its fairly good on its own right, but remember, the Beatles had not yet changed pop culture, and had not yet become, well, fab, so the vocals are off, theres one to many covers, and the JL/PM songs besides the two I mentioned are fairly forgettable, still, its alot better then alot of the crap being released today, and it is an essiental part of any Beatle collection, just don't expect an Abbey Road or Sgt. pepper's here.
0393324818|5.0|Moneyball is the Moby Dick of baseball, but it takes lots less time to read.  When was the last time you read a \\"sports\\" book with all star writing equal to the best being done in any genre?  When was the last time you learned how a big time business really worked?  When was the last time you witnessed dinosaur thinkers exposed and humiliated?  When was the last time you saw innovation trump accepted dogma?  Michael Lewis does all this, weaving together the different pieces of his narrative into a seamless whole packed with humor, insights, and multiple layers.  This is a terrific creation: hats off to the author.  It's a great read and a great gift.  Even if you think baseball is dull as dishwater or worse, you will love this.  P.S. The Afterword alone is worth the price of admission.
B000002UAU|5.0|if any album captures the spirit of the phycedellic, rebelious, peace loving 60's generation, its got to be this, it is, of course, esseintal listening for all rock fans, it was my first album, when I first got it, I was utterly transfixed, songs merging into one another, waiting, there's story in my rock album. <br />The album starts with the feeling of a concept album, you can hear the tune ups, and then a mighty guitar riff, and the famous line \\"it was 20 years ago today\\" becons you on your epic journey. The song moves into \\"With a Little Help from my Friends\\" which is by all means Ringo's best song, we move into \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" arguably the most famous Beatles song ever written, its story telling on a level Lewis Caroll would be proud of. Getting Better and Fixing a Hole are my least favorites, but they are still superb, they just don't meassure up.  <br />The album then really moves into storytelling, Pauls \\"She's Leaving Home\\" is a beautiful melody inspired by a true story, and John's \\"Being for the Benifit of Mr. Kite\\" is luncacy taken straight from a poster he found at an antique shop, then the album moves into Within you Without you, Georges huge song about indian culture, its capitvating, un-nerving, unsettling, yet somehow, every time you listen to it you feel better about yourself. <br />\\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\" is probably the most standard McCartney song on the album, but its a good ditty nontheless, I find \\"Lovely Rita\\" a bit on the over-rated side, but its still good, \\"Good Morning Good Morning\\" is a great rock anthem for anyone, then we move into the finale, the album began with a concert style track, and it ends with that in \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band reprise\\" which has got to be the best reprise in rock history, its arguably better then the first song, due to the irresitable \\"one two three four\\" at the beginning and the greatly delivered \\"Sgt. Pepper's one and only lonely hearts club band\\" line.  <br />But the album is farfrom over, A Day in the Life is brilliant, its poetry at its finest, it merges reality with fiction, its a great way to end an album, plus, you get that dog whistle at the end and the continually chanted line \\"Paul will come back as superman\\" (well, thats my interperation of it) its just the best ending to one of the finest albums ever.  <br />
0446577383|3.0|David Baldacci books are an interesting thing: I either love them or I tolerate them.  This book I tolerated.  The novel centers around Alex Ford, a Secret Service Agent who joins forces with the Camel Club, a ragtag bunch who sole purpose is to detect conspiracies within the government.  The club stumbles upon a murder that is connected to a plot that involves terrorists and brinks the war to the brink of Nuclear War.  The book spews out some anti-American rhetoric that I have grown tired of hearing out of the media.  If you are looking for a quick read, look elsewhere.
B00003CXRM|5.0|The Coen brothers have done it again. After Fargo they made another brilliant and different movie. <br /> <br />It's an adaptation of Homer's Oddysey and there are numerous references to that ancient story. <br />Ulysses (*) Mcgill gets out of prison with two men who are next to him on the chain gang. They call themselves adventurers and it really is an adventure through the state of Mississippi. They meet sirens, a cyclops and a blind radioshow host (Homer). <br /> <br />Besides the ancient myths there are also some southern myths, like when they pick up Tom Johnson at the crossroads after he had just sold his soul to Satan to play guitar. A myth that later Robert Johnson took over and made it his own. <br /> <br />Talking about music, never has one movie done a type of music so much good. Bluegrass, country, gospel, beautiful music in the entire music. Getting the soundtrack is almost worth as much as the movie. Another thing that is soothing to the ear are the great dialogues spoken by George Clooney. <br /> <br />Soothing to the eye are the beautiful colors used. It was one of the first movies to digitally enhance some landscapes and because of that the colorsetting of the movie is now yellow, with some white and green and everything in between.  <br /> <br />A real treat for the senses, including the mind.
B00005JO1Y|4.0|This movie is very beautiful and poetic and a fun amusement park ride, but I left thinking that it didn't really reach it's full potential, despite its great length and all the technical wizardry.    I just didn't feel like the characters were fully fledged.  Many minor ones were cardboard cut-outs who's main purpose was to get killed at certain points along the way, which was fine.  But others who we should have been deeply invested in felt like actors in a drama instead of full characters.  They needed more conversation and self-awareness and humor, like LOTR had.      Kong himself was brilliant - as an ape he was a wordless pantomime character who transmitted feeling and emotion perfectly and was a great tragic figure, and that alone will make this movie a milestone.  I felt terrible as the planes kept circling back, again and again, unstoppable and relentless. As a force of modernity, they were the grim reaper made real.     Still, 4 stars for the hypnotizing beauty of Naomi Watts.  She can gaze longingly or knowingly or despairingly like a living, breathing Greek Goddess in the midst of High Drama, all day long. Her star is assured.   __________________________________  Some details that are completely irrelevant in a fantasy like this:     1) Gorillas are in Africa, not the South Pacific. Kong should have been a giant Orangutan.      2) Giant animals require thousands of square miles to hunt and feed. The island was too small.  The best bets in real life which had large fauna and a unique ecosystems are Madagascar or Australia.  But early man killed off large fauna everywhere in the world for the last 100,000 years - probably by hunting the young before they became too large.      3) Interestingly, 300+M years ago before vertebrates conquered the land, earth had a higher oxygen content in the atmosphere which supported giant insects, including primitive land-scorpions 5' long and dragonflies with a 2' wingspan - not unlike the movie.    4) If Kong was 6' tallhe would have weighed 350 lbs.  At 25' tall, assuming you cube the scale as mass increases in parallel to volume, King Kong would have weighed (350)* 4.1(3rd pwr) = 350*69 = 24,150 lbs. - around 12 tons, or twice the size of a large African elephant - a big ape indeed.  T-Rex fossils indicate that they were around 5-7 tons back 70M years ago but the creatures in the movie looked to be about the same size as Kong.    But apes are about 5 times as strong as humans of the same weight because they have denser muscle fibers.  So he would have been at least as strong as: 69*5 people, or 345 people combined - all big , football-player sized guys. Kong was truly fully-realized giant on the screen.  One has to look closely to even notice the CGI.  Kong makes its predecessors and hundreds of others look like well-intended puppet shows. It sets the new standard for major movies.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I've read so many reviews of this album, and 90% of them don't make any type of sense.  I really don't understand how you can say Radiohead of all \\"disappointing\\" groups is better then Coldplay.  There is a reason Coldplay is mainstream and Radiohead is not...really. (by the way I don't understand what is so wrong with mainstream...somebody will have to explain that one to me) And to those of you who say that Parachutes and AROBTTH are better albums...I say X&Y is just as good.  Am I the only one hearing all the melody that this album has to offer, I mean let's stop criticizing Chris Martin's singing and the lyrics and how deep they are for a moment..and just listen to the \\"MUSIC\\".  Coldplay will be known for their \\"MUSIC\\" 20 years from now not their lyrics, which are by the way great anyway.  Finally, back to this thing about how Radiohead's \\"OK Computer\\" is better then \\"X&Y\\"...just stop kidding yourselves.  The only two things I think of when hearing Radiohead mentioned is BORING and zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz......                        P.S....there aren't too many bands out there that have a defining song that has a recognizable tune, and for Coldplay that song is Clocks...if anyone can name me another band today with a defining song like Clocks, then I may consider putting them in the same sentence as Coldplay, but until then, we should just all face the fact that Coldplay is the band to beat today!!            Highlights on the album:    Square One - no other song out in today's music era sounds like this song, very rock operaesque.    White Shadows - really, I think puts into perspective how fragile, small, vulnerable us human beings are.    Fix You - just listen to it, you'll know why its a highlight.    Talk - this song has tons of good flowing melody, to me, it has sounds in it that remind me of some ELO songs.    Speed of Sound - just a solid song.    A Message - simple but very nice melody.    Low - one of my all time favorite Coldplay songs.    The Hardest Part - this song has a great simple sound, this is probably my favorite along with Square One on the album.    'Til Kingdom Come - sounds like something Johnny Cash would sing, and I know it was written for him, however, the hidden track on the import album \\"How You See the World\\", is better then track itself.    * note - all the other songs not mentioned are all very very nice, however, these songs listed are my highlights. (unmentioned songs are still better then any other band's best song out there today)        overall rating:  10/10
B0009HLDFU|5.0|Grohl's musical abilities continue to surprise me. The guy demonstrates his widespread talent by moving from the rockin' jams of the first CD to the acoustic mellow-lounge sound of the second disc. If you've ever enjoyed Foo you will not be disappointed.
B00082ZS5W|5.0|This DVD is best thing that I've got in 2005. 90 minutes You'll enjoy in amazing Dido voice and in her perfect songs: White Flag, Thank You, Life For Rent and many more. This DVD is just perfect. If You love Dido music You must have this DVD in Your colection.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|I thought the \\"Metropolis\\" DVD was good... this one just blew me away. <br /> <br />The quality of this DVD is just gorgeous and everything on the set is thoughtfully included, no filler here! Mike's drum solo is great fun, he pulls down some audience members and gets them to whack on the drums with him, absolutely priceless to see. *grin* <br /> <br />James was a bit rough during the performance and I honestly think he is losing the ability to sing all that high in the stratosphere melodies somewhat, at least during their live sets which are always lengthy. <br /> <br />The songs performed cover a good range of material, there is some emphasis on \\"Train of Thought\\" as this was supporting tour for it. They rock hard as always, but I feel the real breath-taking moments are when they perform their ballads. Take note, intro to \\"Hollow Years\\" is not to be missed! <br /> <br />Dream Theater is a band that needs to be seen live to be fully appreciated and for those folk like me that are not included in their tour schedules (I live in Australia) this is an essential buy - heck, it's essential even if you do get to see them live!
B000002UJQ|5.0|I've been a Radiohead fan for a while and their music grows on me day-to-day.  OK Computer is without a doubt a classic album. Nothing will ever sound like it. Just the booklet art is worth the money.  And the sounds, the noises, the melodies are all very well arranged and put together.  This \\"trip Album\\" It's amazingly sad and melancholic and to me it signifies the world, peoples behaviors, and the fact that you're never happy until you figure out the meaning of your life.  This CD is in my collection, i hope it's in yours too.  Thanks for reading this.
0517220784|5.0|I've been a Sherlockian since I was sixteen, and for a long time the only copies of the stories I had were battered, dog-eared paperbacks, riddled with typos, that made me wince every time I picked them up. But yay, now I have a Sherlock Holmes collection that I'm not ashamed to display on my bookshelf! I'm no serious book collector who HAS to have fancy leather-bound volumes, so to me this a lovely edition. The different short stories and novels are laid out in a very orderly manner, so they're easy to find. If you're a fan of the great detective, and you're sick of looking at your ugly old paperbacks, I'd get this edition. And if you're NOT a fan of Holmes, well... Get with it.
B0000019PA|5.0|I agree with the reviewers that this is the best of the Elephant Six bands. While Apples in Stereo make it clear that feel unfortunate that they missed the 60's, Neutral Milk Hotel communicates telepathically with Syd Barrett, adds a touch of Brian Wilson with Sergeant Pepper as the backing band (if they forgot to invite Paul).  This would be classed as outsider music (a cloying term) but its not someone who isn't mentally all there rambling some barely musical word salad so that fake goateed hipsters can pretend to applaud. This is a lost masterpiece! Lost in that upon release it didn't get nearly the recognition it deserved and now people are finding out what they missed in not buying this album when it came out. Aeroplane over the Sea makes the synapses in your neurons glow in patterns like the Lite Brite sets you owned as a kid. If you don't believe me buy it and see for yourself.
B00002E224|4.0|I watched this movie because I watched the sequel that's made nine years after \\"Before Sunrise\\" was made.  Despite its age, \\"Before Sunrise\\" is still as relevant as ever, talking about love.  How quaint that two strangers met on a train would transcend cultures, customs, languages and find a connection in one day.  Love is truly a strange but wonderful thing.  It's not the quantity of days that you love someone or someone loving you back but the quality of love that you transmit and reciprocate back from the other person.  Love ain't acting lovey dovey to one another but the sensation of loving someone and being loved back.  In this movie, we can feel it.  The chemistry, the longing, the desire are all there.  That makes it even more unbearable to continue watching when we know that when the sun rises the next day, they would go their separate ways.  Yet, we are compelled to continue watching because we yearn for them to stick together just as any Hollywood movies would, offering gullible audience those cliche ending of living happily ever after.  Real life is more complicated than that, lovers love one another and yet, they end up with other persons but does that mean that love would cease to exist there and then?  Would it be right for the persons who don't end up with their loved ones to continue loving the persons that they wish they would end up with?  Would that be a sense of betrayal to the present partners that the lovers end up being together with?  If lovers truly meant for one another, wouldn't they just give up everything for the sake of love or being rational adults, they need to do what is deemed right?  What is right and true anyhow?  Ultimately, \\"Before Sunrise\\" and its sequel raises questions about love and as the end credit rolls, we would ponder upon this question for the longest time yet.  A movie or movies that are worth watching to remind us about the virtue of love.  Love is such a transient entity and yet, it lasts longer than the Roman Empire and even Christ Himself.  No extra features on DVD but a definite collectible.  A movie that you would revisit again and again.  A very honest movie that's made on a shoe-string budget and a movie to remind studios that big budget doesn't necessarily move our heart strings but an original idea would, like this one
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Exactly what makes Serenity a good movie?    It's cinematic structure does not rely on \\"little green men\\" or \\"bug-eyed monsters\\" to tell a story of human struggle.  It assumes that mankind does not make quantum leaps in technology and thus the story line does not hang on a wildly futuristic,  scientific/philosophical \\"Deus Ex Machina\\" to pull the good guys' fat out of the fire. It works on the premise that, in the distant future, people are people and governments are governments just as they are today.    And that may also be the reason why \\"Serenity\\" is considered to be a terrible movie.  Those that hate it seem to hate it exactly because of how different it is from the rest of the genre in the above mentioned respects.  I had an aquaintence start spouting off about \\"no Faster Than Light travel\\",  \\"no aliens\\" and \\"a pod race ripoff\\" when \\"discussing\\" the movie.  Funny, I don't remember the Mule/Reaver skiff chase scene being 1/8th as loud as the pod race in Star Wars Episode 1 -- which I heard on line outside the theatre  through a building wall. Inside the theatre, my ears nearly bled during that scene.     Consider this:  Many reviewers make mention of how Mal Reynolds is a Han Solo character like this is a bad thing.  I believe that the strength of the first three Star Wars movies is in the characters -- as is the case of Serenity (and the Firefly series for that matter).  An action-adventure movie without a believeable, three-dimensional leading  character isn't much of an action-adventure movie. So there are obvious similarities between Mal and Han.  And your point is?    Finally this about the movie's box-office success:  There have been a number of big budget movies made recently that did a whole lot worse than Serenity did at the boxoffice. The classic comparison example is Stealth (with a production budget of something over $300 million) which has made back a very small fraction of its budget in boxoffice and DVD earnings.  Serenity, on the other hand, isless than half a million dollars away from breaking even on it's $38 million production budget as the DVD is released.  Hmmmm.....    On to the DVD.  Like most DVDs, Serenity has the usual outtakes, cut scenes, \\"the making of\\" and commentary.  These items are what further drive the sales of a DVD. Serenity does deliver on this.  While the outtake language gets a bit salty at times, it is also gut-bustingly funny and irreverent! The \\"making of\\" material is very interesting and provides some insights into how one can make  a good movie on a small budget.  At times Joss's commentary gets a bit preachy, but just when he does get preachy, he pokes fun at himself.  Most of the time he describes how craft of movie-making is done through detailed planning and how sometimes it's just plain dumb, quirky luck.    Finally, watch out for the Easter Egg! It's Fruity AND Oatey!    Thank you for your time...
0517543052|5.0|I read this as I was just beginning buddhism.  The book has a profound insight into what goes on with buddhism, and the biography part was very informative.  The section in the back about how to get started with buddhism was a great aid to me, and probably will be for you.  I would recommend this to anyone interested in Buddhism, or just beginning with it.  As a casual read, it may be a bit bland, but for those who read with a purpose in mind, this book will be very helpful.
B0002TX4QQ|1.0|This book has a number of problems. Poor character development is a big one. The author uses a technique known as splitting in psychology: the bad guys are bad to the bone and the good guys are angels. No wonder such black or white characters lack credibilty. Same goes for most of their actions. Eva gets pregnant even though she doesn't want to, and has the son from hell. Why does the author expect us to believe that Eva would willingly get pregnant again after this harrowing experience? Also, does Lionel Shriver really think that an infant who has  just started saying his first words is capable of forming a double negative sentence like \\"Not if I don't feel wike it\\". Give me a break! One does not have to be an expert on child development; this is just common sense.    It is clear that Lionel Shriver put a lot of time and effort into learning about Armenian culture so that she could pepper the whole book liberally with Armenian words. If only she had spent a fraction of that time talking to an eye doctor, she would have learned what a transplantation is and would have avoided making that ridiculous statement along the lines of \\"Infection had destroyed any chance of a transplant\\". Without going into too much detail let's just say that I at least got a good laugh out of this book!    I admit that I did not see the final bomb coming but building events purely for their shock value is the job of tabloid writers, not serious authors. Motive seems to be a foreign concept to Lionel Shriver. However, when an author does not work enough on character development this is the end result.     My overall impression? As she neared the end of her child-bearing years, the author who was self-admittedly a fence-sitter on the issue of having kids for a long time decided to take one last look at this. The whole book appears to have been written with one purpose only: to justify the author's decision not to have any children. That may explain the reason for the splitting and why Kevin had to be the ultimate kid from hell. There is no room for gray in this author's world. That is a big part of why the book is, in two words, not believable.  I sincerely hope that the author is in peace with her decision. Based on what I know of her writing though, I just do not think I will be reading any of her other books.

B00005JO1Y|4.0|It's been 72 years since audiences were graced with Merian C. Coopers epic KING KONG film, a movie that stunned and amazed. Never before seen special effects and a great story greeted those who bustled into theaters in 1933. And now, in 2005, Peter Jackson (director of the excellent LORD OF THE RINGS film trilogy) takes on the task of reintroducing movie-goers with this legendary tale.<br /><br />If you've been sleeping under a rock for the past 72-plus years, let me enlighten you: King Kong is a massive ape (about the size of a T-Rex Dinosaur) that lives on the fictitious Skull Island. Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong), a filmmaker, is desperate to find the island and shoot a new film starring actress Ann Darrow (Fay Wray). But once they find the island, a group of nasty natives captures Miss Darrow and \\"present\\" her to King Kong as a gift. A race to save Ann Darrow ensues and, on top of that, to capture and brind Kong back to New York City to show off as the 8th Wonder of the World.<br /><br />Once captured and returned to NYC, all goes horribly wrong as Kong escapes, recaptures Miss Darrow, climbs to the top of the Empire State Building, and is shot to death by Army Air Corp planes.<br /><br />______________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />The thing that made the 1933 Kong so interesting was the relationship between Kong and Miss Darrow's character. And Peter Jackson uses that to full advantage here, going even further in his telling of that unusual relationship by having Ann Darrow (now played by Naomi Watts) actually care for Kong as much as he cares for her. That's not to say this is about some twisted relationship between simian and human, but the emotions they feel for one another is easily palpable throughout the movie. This is the biggest strength of the film and one of Mr. Jackson's fortes (watch the LORD OF THE RINGS if you doubt it).<br /><br />And speaking of LORD OF THE RINGS, that film was Peter Jackson's crowning achievement. The care and meticulous nature with which he put those movies together are easily seen. But here, that meticulousness got a bit lost...<br /><br />Problems:<br /><br />#1. The relationship between two of the shipmates (a mentor/student type) is given lots of screen time and then summarily dropped without explanation as to why the relationship was started in the first place.<br /><br />#2. Jack Black (SCHOOL OF ROCK, 2003) picks up the roll as filmmaker Carl Denham and does so only moderately well. Part of the problem was the scripting of his character. He's not a very nice man, will do anything (even risk the lives of everyone and everything) to get what he wants, and says the hollow \\"It was beauty that killed the beast\\" line at the end of the film (which rang completely false considering how Kong came to be in New York in this version).<br /><br />#3. When the ship carrying all of the prime characters becomes lost, the captain asks one of his crew to take the sextant out and spot some stars. Umm, sextants are used to measure the movement of the sun across the horizon, not stars.<br /><br />#4. The film was just too long. My butt began to ache from sitting in a theater for three hours. Cutting length really was needed. But I think Mr. Jackson is a bit spoiled on this issue thanks to the success of his LORD OF THE RINGS trilogies.<br /><br />#5. The cutesy ice-rink scene (barf!).<br /><br />Although these problems plagued the film, there was some stunning CGI work that actually made me dizzy. Specifically, the airplane scenes as they shot at Kong on top of the building. The circling and diving of the planes was amazing. Kong's presence was also completely believable although we all know it's a CGI creation. But he was so lifelike that it took absolutely no effort on my part to suspend disbelief that he wasn't real.<br /><br />And that's about it for one of this year's blockbuster films. A good film, but one that needed a bit more detailed care by someone as sharp as Mr. Jackson.ded a bit more detailed care by someone as sharp as Mr. Jackson.
5550065452|4.0|When I first picked this up, I thought it was a thriller/suspense novel.  I suppose becuase a Stephen King book I had read previously referred to \\"Rebecca\\" a few times.  What a surprise to find this a tale of love, grief, struggle, murder, and basically...life.<br /><br />I still enjoyed it even though I thought it was something other than it was.  It has its share of suspense and thrills, but nothing like I thought.  This is a worthwhile read and great piece of fiction.  I recommend it to all.<br /><br />I can't really tell much more about it without giving away details of the story.  Read for yourself.....it's worth it and it won't take long!
B000A59PMO|5.0|Rob Thomas envisioned a detective story with a dark, noir feel, while the studio mainly wanted to have a high school drama. What we ended up with is Veronica Mars, often said to be targeted at the young female demographic. Another common comparison says it's the \\"new Buffy.\\"  So what's a guy like myself, well past his teens and who never saw a single episode of Buffy, doing here? Frankly, all the narrow statements on who the target demographic and intended audience are supposed to be are only doing a great disservice to the show.    It's got a far more general appeal: if you simply like quality shows, witty dialog, fun and mystery, or a good cast, you're bound to like it. It took a lot of glowing recommendations from TV critics and the likes of Joss Whedon to finally convince me to give it a chance, and I'm glad I did.    The show's strongest point is probably the acting. Kristen Bell as the titular character does some phenomenal work, and Enrico Colantoni in the role of her father is also a delight to watch. Unbelievable how both of them got overlooked by the Emmys, not even getting a nomination. On the other hand, the show's weakness lies in it being ambitiously grounded in reality. Other than it taking place in the fictional small town of Neptune, it's all meant to be present-day real world stuff. This makes it harder to suspend disbelief if you spot things which are technologically impossible or silly, or violate standard court and police procedures. My recommendation is to avoid most of the extremely nit-picky recaps and forum discussions all around the 'net, lest they unnecessarily point out things you would've never noticed anyway, and lessen your enjoyment.    This DVD set release is a mixed bag. It's got some slick design and packaging, all the basic necessities. What it doesn't really have are extras and bonus features. You get 22 minutes of deleted scenes, all jumbled together in one continuous clip, plus one and a half minutes more at the start of the Pilot episode. And that is all. The dearth of extras was explained to be a conscious decision of trying to get the DVD out as early as possible, in order to let new viewers - such as myself - catch up with the story thus far. This, I can support and understand, yet can't help but feel disappointed that it isn't reflected in the selling price at all. In fact, this was easily the most expensive \\"TV on DVD\\" that I've bought in the past several months. Was it worth it? I'd say yes, and the purchase hopefully also serves as a vote for the network to pick Veronica Mars up for a third season.    One final note. While all packaging and information claims this as limited to Region 1 only, all six discs were actually formatted as playable in Regions 1, 2, 3 and 4 as well, which should make it playable almost anywhere in the world (5 and 6 excluded) without any hassle. Obviously, I can't guarantee that your copy will be the same, but I felt this was worth noting.
B000AP04L0|2.0|The movie is great; this review is not about the movie, about the gift set.   The stapler, mug and other \\"gifts\\" in this set are worthless, do not even look like those in the movie.  Avoid disapontment, just get a DVD.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is a show that I originally missed when it was being aired. I actually had never heard of it until recently when a few friends of mine recommended it to me. I decided that it sounded like something that I would like so I made a special trip to go purchase the complete series. <br /> <br />Ever since then, I have been watching at least an episode a day. Usually 2 episodes a day actually. I think this show is wonderful! The characters are GREAT in the way that they are all different and they all intermingle with one another. The plot is wonderful and each story has nice plot twists and suspense. <br /> <br />I couldn't have asked for more. I went out on December 20th to buy Serenity as well. I'm sure it will be just as good as Firefly is! <br /> <br />Firefly is one of the best shows I have ever seen! Absolutely BRILLIANT!!!
B000002KZA|4.0|Depeche Mode began their journey to 80's icon status with \\"Construction Time Again\\". The 1984 release marks the arrival of Alan Wilder, whose brilliant synth helped mold the bands evolution through four consecutive fine albums, beginning with this. His work would become more complex and lush in the subsequent \\"Some Great Reward\\", and especially \\"Black Celebration\\", but there is already a marked difference from the more Vince Clarke influenced arpegios and blips of \\"A Broken Frame\\". The Depeche Mode sound is being constructed before your ears (making the title quite appropriate). \\"Love, In Itself\\" is a brilliant opener, its first notes alternating a rapid fire energy with majestic chords. David Gahan's vocals also are far more confident and it is instantly clear that Depeche Mode has found the right recipe, and it's far more sophisticated than what they've offered before. \\"Construction Time Again\\" doesn't quite reach the consistent and inventive excellence of the next three DM albums, but it does contain two other bona fide Mode classics; \\"Told You So\\" and \\"Everything Counts\\". \\"Told You So\\"'s jittery machine intro quickly morphs into a sweepingly dramatic synth run, which then is counterpointed by Gahan's rapid fire delivery of some of Martin Gore's more interesting lyrics. \\"Bring me my gun of itching desire/Bring me my bullets/And I will fire.\\" \\"Told You So\\" is apocalpyptically good fun, ending with the final refrain whispered several times by a child. Its ebullience still brings a smile. \\"Everything Counts\\" is perhaps Depeche Mode's most revered song, and it is simply masterful. It showcases the bands innate ability to write extremely imaginative melodies, that seem to evoke the exotic, which they then couple with a memorable chorus i.e. \\"The grabbing hands/Grab all they can/Everything counts/In large amounts\\". There are some uneven moments on \\"Construction Time Again\\", \\"More Than a Party\\" is a bit flimsy, and \\"Pipeline\\", despite some cool production is sluggish and sort of dopey. For the most part, however, \\"Construction Time Again\\" is a major step forward for Depeche Mode, and the true beginning of their unique and formidable 80's legacy.
B00005JNQS|3.0|And you thought raising a human child was tough! If you live in the world of ROBOTS, you literally have to \\"make\\" a child (building it from a box of parts). When the Copperbottoms find out they're going to be parents, they are so excited that the father runs through the street stuffing cigars into robots' mouths. Once home, and peering into the box of parts, he realizes the task ahead of him: assembling a son. Rodney Copperbottom (Ewan McGregor) is born. We whisk through his childhood and into his teens where we discover his true calling: to become an inventor.<br /><br />Following his dreams, he travels to Robot City to meet his mentor, Mr Bigweld (Mel Brooks), an inventor of all things Robot-like. But upon entering the city and coming to the gates of Mr. Bigweld's offices (ala the gates of Oz), Rodney finds that Mr. Bigweld is nowhere to be found and the company has been taken over by the corrupt Ratchet (Greg Kinnear). Secondhand parts are a thing of the past and Ratchet orders all faulty parts melted down. Every Robot must now purchase upgrades. Can't afford them? Sorry, you'll have to be scrapped.<br /><br />Along with a bum-like robot called Fender (Robin Williams ....think THE FISHER KING) and several hundred of his obsolete buddies, Rodney is headed toward trouble ...and maybe success.<br /><br />______________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Coming off the heals of such phenomenal animated features as SHREK, FINDING NEMO, and ICE AGE, this film falls short but delivers on laughs and fun thanks to the energetic voice of Robin Williams; without him I fear this movie would've flopped entirely. But his action-packed antics made it completely watchable.<br /><br />There have been comments about how slow ROBOTS was to get going, and this is undeniably so. But it was a fairly decent attempt at character and plot set-up. And although ROBOTS lacked anything new in the form of animation or concept, it did entertain enough to make me finish watching and even emitted a guffaw or two.<br /><br />But is it on the same level as those earlier animated super-films? No way. Not even close.ain enough to make me finish watching and even emitted a guffaw or two.  <br /> <br />But is it on the same level as those earlier animated super-films? No way. Not even close.
B000BTJDGC|4.0|Not being a fan of horror genre movies, I was skeptical of watching this movie.  To my surprise this film turned out to be very good.  Be warned, those of you that are looking for slasher, blood and guts kind of movie...this is not one for you. This movie deals with the trial of the actual case from the 1970's, there are some scenes detailing the exorcism, but this is does not overshadow the movie in anyway. I found this movie to be very interesting and I was engrossed in the story itself. Very good film, well executed, good direction. A movie that really should not be missed.
B00000255X|4.0|In terms of moods, Desire offers us a little bit of everything, from angry protests to reflective ballads to happy, upbeat, annoying tunes to...yeah.<br /><br />Although most songs were cowritten by novelist Jacques Levy, Dylan's two solo compositions make up the best moments of the album. First we've got One More Cup of Coffee, where he takes one of music's most overused themes (leaving the unfaithful woman) and makes it seem original. It's a rightful classic, and I'd call it the album's best song. But one could also make a case for Sara, an excellent ballad written for Dylan's ex-wife with some beautiful violin. I've heard that it's inaccurate, but anyone who bothers to find these things out needs to start worrying more about their own life.<br /><br />But the Levy collaborations are good, for the most part. Whether its the righteous fury that opens the album (Hurricane), the Egyptian-influeneced Isis or Western Black Diamond Bay, Jacques Levy really did Dylan a favor in making tis record great.<br /><br />But there are three songs I don't really like. first is Mozambique. In spite of its popularity, it's truly a bland song with some awful backup singing. Another filler is Joey - I lost interest in this one about halfway through. Finally, I don't really think that much of Romance In Durango, though I do enjoy the version with Rolling Thunder.<br /><br />Okay, so it's Tier Two Dylan. But it still belongs in any Dylan fan's record collection, just not until you've soaked up every ounce of Highway Sixty-One, Blood On the Tracks and Bringing It All Back Home.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I just got done seeing the movie for the second time this week, WOW!!!. The first time I saw it four days ago, I've been  numb ever since, because it really hit home with.  <br /> <br />I just want to thank everyone envolved with this picture, and really hope it cleans up at the awards. There's hundreds of gut wrenching, and promising true life stories on the \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" website. This is a story that needed to be told. It's not just a \\"Gay\\" deal, it's what happens in the real world. I really believe this film will open quite a few eyes. It really sucks being in a situation like these guys, even in 2005. I should know I am in one right now. <br /> <br /> \\"The land of the free, and the home of the brave\\". It seems to me, alot of us are brave enough to be who we really are. We just long to be free like everyone else, that knows what true love really means.  As free as some other countries who are recognizing the true love between people of the same sex. We don't have to be a stereotypical gay man or woman as TV sitcomes, and films so far have portrayed, we are everywhere. I knew it was going to take some time, but I've always thought we lived in a country that always takes the \\"Bull by the Horns\\", and shows everyone else in this world what freedom is all about. I guess we'll have to see what happens in the next few months when it opens up in major theatres. I'm thinking very positive about this film. I sure hope it's a turning point for all of us. <br /> <br />

B000BW7QWW|4.0|I'm torn between giving Serenity 4 or 5 stars.  I loved the \\"Firefly\\" series and own it on DVD -- and if you're already up to speed on the characters and history of the ship, this is a five-star entry. For newcomers, however, I'd have to say it's not quite as compelling. Without knowing the characters' history and quirks, you won't \\"get\\" a lot of the references.  Some of the deleted scenes -- especially those explaining Inara's relationship to Mal -- should have been left in. And there are a couple of places where the storyline seems to go off-track. (How did the Alliance Operative get past the Reavers to do battle with Mal near the end?)  Still, this is a fun, fast-paced movie, and if you're a Firefly fan, you definitely ought to see it. If you're not yet a Browncoat, rent or buy the series and watch it first, as that will add greatly to your enjoyment of the movie.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Just when I was getting so tired of Madonna wearing her Kabbalah bracelets and rapping about Starbucks, she went and made the best dance album I've heard in a long time.  It's infectious and catchy.  I haven't stopped listening to it since I got it.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|The Iliad story has survived through the thousands of years because it was refined to perfection. So it would be a common sense to try to stay close to the original story and not try to \\"improve\\" it. Unfortunately, the movie has very little in common with the original Iliad.<br /><br />It became a really primitive film with a lot of blood and violence.<br /><br />Pretty much the only reason I finished watching the movie was to see how far the story if off and I wouldn't watch it again.
B00013RC8O|3.0|This movie is an nice memory of the 70's. well done. A good car chase movie in a weak story, 70's style with little effect. My son who is 11, loved it.<br /><br />One bad issue though was the main character using drugs, putting me is a position where I had some serious explaining to do.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|The timing of this film could not be more propitious as the courts struggle with Darwinism, Creationism, and separation of church and state, creating embittered conversations about fact versus faith.  The fact that this film adaptation of an actual event results in a work of such touching tenderness is due to the imagination and artistry of writer Paul Harris Boardman and co-writer and director Scott Derrickson, as well as a fine cast of some of our best actors.  This is not a horror flick: this is a thinking person's film that has the courage to discuss the possibilities of things on one can explain.<br /><br />Father Moore (a brilliant Tom Wilkinson) is a priest being tried for negligent homicide in the death of a young college student Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter), a parishioner who sought his help feeling she was possessed by demons.  The archdiocese hires pragmatic, agnostic lawyer Erin Bruner (Laura Linney in another superlative role) to defend Father Moore.  The prosecuting attorney is strongly religious Methodist Ethan Thomas (Campbell Scott in an atypical role well realized).  The film is basically a courtroom drama: the polar sides being scientific (medical) facts versus spiritually based possibilities and the writing for both lawyers is bitingly incisive.  Mixed into the testimony and preparation for the trial are flashbacks to the events leading up to Emily's death, including the gradual possession of Emily's body by six demons and her reaction to the possession, and the exorcism performed by Father Moore.  The priest does not fear jail or loss of clerical collar: his only concern is that he be able to tell Emily's shared story, a story that raises more questions in everybody's minds than providing legal results of the trial.<br /><br />Laura Linney is extraordinary as the agnostic hardened lawyer whose very being is shaken by the case which she tries. The nuances of her character are so well conveyed that we come to understand the un-understandable as she sees it.  Likewise Tom Wilkinson and Campbell Scott shine, as do all of the minor characters.  The cinematography of Tom Stern  is among the most artful of the year and the musical score by Christopher Young is intensely atmospheric. This is not yet another in the endless line of horror flicks, though the Para scientific manifestations of demon possession are graphically enacted (not my cup of tea but necessary for the story).  This is a much more important story than that and one that would be helpful in aiding understanding if both agnostics/pragmatists and spiritual people watched and listened carefully.  Highly recommended. Grady Harp, December 05ikewise Tom Wilkinson and Campbell Scott shine, as do all of the minor characters.

B000850IHW|5.0|OK folks, I actually saw this awesome band live - they opened for J. Tull in Detroit, MI in 1972 (I think that is the right year).  Anyway, not having been to many rock shows yet, I did not know what to expect.  All of a sudden, this band bursts on stage and literally rips through an array of songs.  I couldn't believe what I was experiencing.  Not only could these guys play and sing, their showmanship was outstanding.  Super high energy, running, jumping around, barely making it back to the microphones to sing their intricate vocal harmonies.  Totally mind blowing experience - props to Jethro Tull (they were still excellent) to have such a dynamic, talented band open for them.
6304806418|4.0|Up until recently, the only songs I knew from \\"Evita\\" were \\"Don't Cry For Me, Argentina\\" and \\"Another Suitcase In Another Hall\\", which I heard on the Sarah Brightman CD. When \\"Evita\\" came to Tampa on Broadway, my 9-year-old sister was asked to play one of the children in the production, and so I had the opportunity to see it. Since this was really the only time I had ever heard music from \\"Evita\\", I really enjoyed the woman who played Eva Peron, who had somewhat of a \\"higher\\" voice than Patti LuPone. We bought the original broadway cast album at the show and I didn't really enjoy it as much. Patti LuPone is NOT a good singer in my opinion. While Eva's part may have been written for that kind of voice, I don't enjoy it probably because I already loved the performance I heard.<br /><br />Well my parents saw this film when it first came out, and both said that they fell asleep during it. But since I enjoyed the Broadway show so much, I bought it and I am so glad I did. Some songs have been transposed to better fit Madonna's strong but limited vocals, and I must say that she does a good job performing the songs in this film. Yes, it's true, she isn't anything like Patti LuPone, but for someone who is not accustomed to LuPone's harsh and riduclous vocals, you'll enjoy Madonna's performance a lot.<br /><br />All of the music in \\"Evita\\" is beautifully written and peformed save a few songs that are too \\"rock\\" for my tastes. The costumes are great, the production is great, everything is just surprisingly good. There is no dialogue in the film, but there isn't any in the Broadway play either, so this didn't bother me. The film seems SO long without that 15 minute intermission, and after \\"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\\", you're wanting Eva to just die so it'll all be over. But it's still a really enjoyable movie; I just recommend taking a break in the middle.<br /><br />Antonio Banderas performed well except on a few occasions where his Latino accent gets in the way of this obviously American-written musical. Jonathan Pryce's performance is a joke. He can't act, he can't sing, and it is quite obvious he's lypsynching through the whole film. Jimmy Nail had great vocals but wasn't young enough to play the suave and handsome Agustin Magaldi.<br /><br />Some of the changes between the Broadway production and film are quite annoying, but if you haven't ever seen the Broadway version then this won't be an issue; Peron's mitress originally performed \\"Another Suitcase In Another Hall\\", but the song was sung by Eva in the film. Also, in the opening scenes where Madonna is playing a 15-year-old, they should have given her some heavy duty makeup. She was 38 years old here, but she looks even older.<br /><br />Overall, not comparing to the Broadway performance at all, I give this film 4 out of 5 stars because of Jonathan Pryce's performance and the \\"rock\\" songs.<br /><br />As a side note, the DVD is pathetic. There isn't any Special Features except Chapter Search, English captions and Spanish subtitles. There is a widescreen DVD available, which is the version I have.ical.

How wrong can you be?<br />Spy game has a blend of action inside and outside the CIA offices. It also shows what a man can do and how far he can go for love.<br />Some of the story takes place in Beirut during the civil war in the late 1970's. Since I lived there during most of that period, I can say the recreation of Beirut and life in that city during that crazy time are pretty accurate. Enough said.<br />DVD quality, picture and sound are excellent. Highly recommended.

B000002JSN|5.0|Oh the seventies.  Its a real shame that I was born in '79.  I've been an avid rock fan for the last ten years or so and after listening to tunes from every decade its my opinion that the music was definately at its creative peak in the late sixties and early to mid seventies.  Sure its bands, even the great ones, weren't without their excesses.  And yes many times they would play long elaborate solos where short ones would do.  Plus who can forget that these bands also had to release a mandatory live album with plenty of extensive jamming and a bloated double album with more than enough filler to go around.   <br />While these criticisms are valid, it is what makes these bands so much fun to listen to.  Whether its the spacey concept albums of Pink Floyd, or the super long blues jams of the Cream and the Allman Brothers Band all these factors contributed to an era where the muscians were musicians and the music was for the fans.  Now rock is just another souless, faceless, corporate, over produced, over processed product with little if any passion.  (ok not all modern bands suck, but the great ones are fewer and farther between.) <br />Ok now to the review.  Physical Graffiti is Led Zeppelin's bloated double album with its share or filler. (boogie with stu, black country woman.)  But it is truly one of the era's great double albums.  This album is also marks a change in Zeppelin's sound.  At this point Jimmy Page was really into layering his guitar tracks.  This produced a very dense and heavy sound. <br />On the first disc we are treated to four Zep classics.  \\"The Rover,\\" has a great riff while \\"In My Time of Dying,\\" is a homage to Zep's muscle.  Bonham's drums are especially powerful on \\"Dying.\\"  \\"Trampled Underfoot\\" is exhillarating blend of funk, blues, and heavy metal.  Closing out the first disc is my personal fav from the Zep repetoire, the immortal \\"Kashmir.\\"  This song is again a showcase for a hypnotically powerful Page riff and the Bonzo thunder.  The song with its eastern influenced lyrics is complimented with an orchestra of Indian musicians.  All these factors lead to a truly epic listening experience. <br />Disc one is a powerful album in itself.  However disc two despite some of the filler has many great moments.  \\"In the Light,\\" is an underrated epic, while \\"Down By The Seaside,\\" is a dreamy ballad.  \\"The Wanton Song\\" opens with a truly powerful and funky riff.  As great as those songs are they pale in comparison to heartbroken \\"Ten Years Gone.\\"  \\"Ten Years,\\" is a perfect break up tune about regret and the feeling of emptyiness that accompanies losing someone you thought was your soul mate.  A true classic.  After some filler, the album closes with the heavy and rockin \\"Sick Again.\\"  Its a great way to close one of rock's greatest double albums.  (It is second only to the Beatles delightfully uneven White Album.)
B00000427L|5.0|This is a very good set of Rachmaninov's piano works for a very reasonable price indeed. For those who are unfamiliar with the great russian composer's piano works, from the blazing horns, swelling piano chords and seductive strings opening the first piano concerto you feel right away you're in for a very special musical experience.<br /><br />  Normally, when you know and appreciate what a  musician has created throughout his career, there's almost always one piece of work that stands out or that you like more than the others. When it comes to Rachmaninov's piano works, mine would certainly be the Piano Concerto no 3, one of the most beautiful piano works that were ever written, and also the Concerto no 4. There's a certain nostalgia about this latter work, like feelings about a past gone forever, and you can feel this leitmotiv during the whole concerto. Maybe the fact that Rachmaninov wrote this wonderful concerto after having moved permanently to the US and therefore feeling homesick has something to do with it.<br /><br />  As for Mr Ashkenazy, he simply is the best interpreter when it comes to Rachmaninov's piano works. The great Vladimir is temperate rather than romantic, cool and constantly in control: sometimes he seems pouring out rivers of emotions and passion  without getting carried away though. He has the musicality and intelligence to understand exactly how these concertos work. He has phenomenal technique, original approach, and his touch is quite fiery at times, gentle and tender at others. He can be poetic and passionate when he needs to.<br /><br />  In Rachmaninov's piano concertos the orchestra plays a vital role, often playing the main theme melodies while the piano accompanies, which is rather unusual. In this regard, the London Symphonic Orchestra and conductor A. Pr&eacute;vin are one of the best. Couple this with Rachmaninov's music and Ashkenazy's interpretation, and you're in for a very special musical treat indeed.

0684824906|5.0|Exhausted and disheartened, I see now that the praise heaped upon Doris Kearns Goodwin for this masterpiece is very well-deserved. Read and weep.<br /><br />Each page I turned was more painful to me than the previous, as I grew more and more distracted, wondering how in the course of the last 145 years we have managed to wring the entire range of admirable qualities which so defined Lincoln from the politicians who pretend to represent us today.<br /><br />While I cannot imagine how a single American leader alive today could possibly read \\"Team of Rivals\\" without holding his or her head down in shame, I have no doubt that many of them are convinced they share Lincoln's greatness. How far will we have to sink before such greatness rises among us again? Is there a point of no return?<br /><br />One story of Lincoln's wisdom, not mentioned in Dr. Goodwin's book, would have fit in very well -- Lincoln's reaction when he was advised that the President could invade a neighbor if necessary to repel invasion -- Lincoln replied, \\"Study to see if you can fix any limit to his power in this respect, after you give him as much as you propose.\\"

0553213105|5.0|Jane Austen's great achievement (and she preferred \\"achievements\\" to \\"accomplishments,\\" if you speak early 19th Century English) was to produce a novel esteemed by its contemporaries for what they called its \\"probableness.\\"  They noted she employed none of the fictional gimmicks of the time--their equivalents of car chases--and set a new standard for psychogical perception.  Sir Walter Scott observed that he could \\"do the bow-wow thing\\" but he could not do this.  Those who find fault with the centrality of marriage in the work do not recognize the limited possibilities for women at the time.  Given the narrow sea-room available to her, Elizabeth did marvelously with the minimum possible surrender of her personal freedom.  Really, though, the one who did marvelously was Jane Austen.
0800177177|5.0|This comes from someone that is not a horror movie fan. Dracula was done in plenty of versions. All bad in my opinion or at least a waste of time to watch. This one is the only Dracula movie where you would sit from start to finish, you wake up the next day and you feel like you want to see it again. In this movie there is a great love story as well. The costumes and the photography are superb. DVD quality is also very good. If you want to own 1 Dracula movie, this is the one
B000002NHN|5.0|I notice that Enya and Loreena often get put in the same category.  You are likely to find their albums on the same shelf at a new age store.  But their repertoire is very different.  Enya is benign, airy, superficial.  Loreena is darker, stronger, more toxic.  She is not afraid of exploring some of the less admirable aspects of a human soul.  She is definitely not \\"easy listening\\".  Her music is also more diverse.  She doesn't just stick to Celtic tunes.  She explores Arabic, English, Spanish, Asian motifs.
0393312836|3.0|In this book A Clockwork Orange, the character Alex displays the personality of an adolesent who longs for the attention of his peers. He seems to have a sense of violence instilled within his inner self and cannot seem to get rid of this feeling that he feels. Alex surrounds himself with sex, violence, and hatred which shows what he is really feeling on the inside. Alex started of the book with him and his \\"gang\\" wrecking havoc on the community by stealing a car and then preceeding to Mr. Alexander's house and raping his wife. While raping his wife Alex sings the song \\" Sing'n, in the rain\\". This seems like something someone who is trying to put on a show and act like their cool in front of their friends. The only time Alex was ever a descent person in this book, was when he was spending the first two years of his stay. After he began to feel comfortable with his surroundings the bad Alex seemed to suddenly reappear from the dark side to take over the place of the \\"rehabillitated\\" Alex. I think that the time he was good shows that he can be good when put under pressure by peers. Also when he is in a situation in which his surroundings are unfamilliar and unwilling to cater to every single of his needs. If Alex had never gained that much attention from his familly and \\"gang\\" i dont believe that Alex was really bad to be bad; but he was just bad to gain the respect and attention from his gang and familly.
B000A6T1KE|3.0|Star Trek: TNG was NEVER able to make what I'd consider a GOOD big screen motion picture. \\"Generations\\" was pretty cheesy, \\"First Contact\\" left plenty to be desired, \\"Insurrection\\" was actually the most stimulating and thought-provoking of the films despite the majority of Trek fans even hating it (even though it still isn't a \\"GREAT\\" film in my book) and finally this Nemesis installment is very flat. It has a somewhat incoherent plot, too many storylines. The finding of another \\"Data\\" is a bit corney and unexplained to my satisfaction. Riker and Deanna finally tie the knot after all the back and forth romance through the years with these two and the wedding just didn't do it for me. Frakes and Sirtis don't get the amount of airtime they deserved. Likewise, Michael Dorn's Worf didn't get the amount of attention he deserved as well. The Clone, as another reviewer stated accurately, doesn't even look anything like Patrick Stewart's Picard?? Plus, I WANTED TO FINALLY SEE THE ROMULANS ON THE BIG SCREEN AND WHAT DID I GET? REMANS!? While they were pretty cool and innovative, we really didn't get any Romulans? <br />This movie didn't resolve much for me. The Data death was unneccesary and despressing given that he has fought to become human through all those seasons and is a much beloved character that gets blown-up. That's it? And the whole B-4 thing? Yeesh. This movie is \\"ok\\" but so far below par for the Trek folks, it's a bit sad to see that the ORIGINAL TREK films had so much success with Wrath of Kahn, Voyage Home (the whales), and \\"Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country\\" and then each TNG movie was a flop.....I almost with TNG would come out with another movie just to make things right!! Awesome cast, bad writing and final product...
1400032717|5.0|This book was just brilliant - a rich and witty novel about an autistic boy, christopher,  who discovers a mystery in his street, which opens the novel. He discovers Wellington, a poodle belonging to a neighbour, dead on the lawn. He hugs it because he loves dogs, but unfortunately the neighbour, Mrs Shearer sees him and thinks he has killed the dog and calls the police. Christopher sets out to solve the mystery of who murdered the dog, he likes dogs you see, and in the process he discovers a greater mystery. <br /> <br />Christopher narrates the book and his quirks and observations give the book a wonderful naive clarity. Christopher's world is dominated by logic of which mathematics is the most obvious. His explanations are often reflected in his mathematical formlae. He cannot, however, understand the confusion of human relationships and language, these just aren't logical to him. He doesn't understand or comprehend metaphors, and slang just completely confuses him. He needs explanations of what facial expressions mean and even human contact is anathema to him - he just lashes out.  <br /> <br />When someone tried to explain this book to me, I yawned, and rolled my eyes, but the reality of it is extraodinary. I read it one sitting and then went back and read it again. I thought the perspective, that of an autistic child would be dull - its not. He is unwittingly funny, profound, and his logic and confusions enrich the story. When he gets lost looking for the railway station in his town, it is at once funny, sad, empowering the way he finds it. <br /> <br />this is on to my most highly recommended read of this year. It was rightly a prize winning novel.  <br /> <br />
B000BNI90O|5.0|I am an avid soundtrack collector.  I personally never liked the music of Howard Shore until The Lord of the Rings movies came out.  It's great to have a complete score of any movie.  I have bought most reincarnations of the Star Wars soundtracks and are awaiting expanded versions of Episode II and III.<br /><br />There is only one problem with this set.  If one is not too tech savvy, he/she might have a hard time finding the alternate audio tracks.  On my older Panasonic DVD player, it defaulted to Advanced Resolution Audio with the choice of Stereo or Surround ONLY.  So, at first glance I thought it was false advertising.  Then, I popped it in my Sony DVD player and it finally showed the Dolby Digital Stereo and Surround option with the Advanced Resolution nowhere to be found.  I was hoping that somewhere in the packaging or on their website that they would address this problem, but I couldn't find anything.  So, if you do buy this collection, you should know your DVD player fairly well.  Depending on what your DVD player is, the disc itself will default to one or the other.  While a track is playing, you are able to switch from Title 1 (Advanced Resolution) to Title 2 (Dolby Digital).

0316920045|5.0|I really have nothing to add here in terms of the content of this novel.  Love or hate it as you like.  But... <br />I originally bought a hardcover first edition back in 1996 and made the mistake of lending it out to someone.  So recently I bought a copy in hardcover through Amazon, only to be disappointed with what arrived in the mail.  Apparently they have taken the \\"first paperback edition\\" (as indicated in the title page, as well as by the \\"Back Bay Books\\" (Little Brown's paperback affiliate) insignia) and glued it into a replica of the original blue hardback.  The dustjacket is identical to the first edition, too, but here's my problem: the pages are of paperback quality, and not acid-free like most first editions.  I'd wanted a book of the non-yellowing variety, as I do not intend to lend this one out and hope someday to bring forth precocious grandchildren curious about \\"experimental\\" turn-of-the-millennium fiction.   <br />I wrote Amazon about this issue and received a nice-as-can-be and utterly generic reply (\\"we're sorry you were not satisfied with your order\\" &tc. &c.) as well as a second copy of the book.  (Needless to say in the same format.)  But now I'm just plain curious about this from a publishing perspective.  Has anyone heard of such a practice before?  Is this Amazon or does it originate with publisher Little Brown?

B0000042H4|5.0|For those of you who don't know, Wagner's Ring cycle is the most monumental operatic work of all time. It is made up of 4 operas, and was originally intended to be performed on 4 consecutive nights. The opera is set in a doom laden world where the god Wotan rules. It tells the story of a ring of awesome power, that carries with it a curse.<br /> While there are many great recordings of Wagner's Ring out there - the central debate seems to revolve around the Ring's of Solti, Bohm, or Karajan. Most people seem to prefer one or the other based on the conductor, while others seem to bash Solti's Ring, because of their distaste of Solti, rather than the merits of this recording. I will base my reviews of these three on the merits of their recordings. I love all three of these conductors equally, although I do not love all their Ring's equally.<br /><br />DAS RHEINGOLD:<br /><br />Bohm: The Prelude here is slightly affected by audience noise - so coughs here and there, it continues at soft points throughout (the entire cycle for that matter). It is, however, a slight setback and distraction. Adam, as Wotan, is not quite up to the standard set by Hotter for Solti, however, we get the added bonus of Windgassen's great reading of Loge. Anja Silja is stunning as Freia - my favorite on disc.<br /><br />Karajan: All star cast. The giants are simply magnificent. Fischer-Dieskau is a great Wotan, but again, I prefer Hotter. The conducting here is beautiful and the Berlin Philharmonic shines.<br /><br />Solti: Awesome throughout. Incredible playing by the Vienna Philharmonic. Prelude is to die for as is Flagstad's Fricka. Hotter is great as Wotan - my favorite, and the giants are wonderfully haunting.<br /><br />Advantage - Solti, slightly over Bohm.<br /><br />DIE WALKURE:<br /><br />Bohm: This is a fantastic reading of the Ring's most popular installment. Nienstedt and Burmeister are not on the level of the Hunding or Fricka for Solti or Karajan, but Nilsson's Brunnhilde and Adam's great Wotan make up for that. Wotan's monologue is simply miraculous, and the conducting is brilliant. Bohm takes risks and it pays off. The only flaw - the hectic speeds at which Bohm takes us through the \\"Magic Fire Music\\". The most thrilling Walkure I have heard.<br /><br />Solti: While I agree that this is the \\"weak link\\" of Solti's Ring, I do not agree that this Walkure isn't anything but marvelous. This Walkure has the best cast throughout - King and Crespin shine as Siegmund and Sieglinde, and again we have Nilsson's glorious Brunnhilde and Hotter's inspiring Wotan. \\"Magic Fire Music\\" is absolutely glorious.<br /><br />Karajan: In Walkure, Karajan's \\"smoothing over\\" of the Ring's terror is at its height. Cast and orchestra are wonderful. Sound is rich and beautiful, although somewhat toned down. Drama seems to be sacrificed for beauty. Crespin is fine as Brunnhilde, although not on par with Nilsson.<br /><br />Advantage: I give it to Bohm. Hands down!<br /><br />SIEGFRIED:<br /><br />I am in the minority here, as Siegfried is my favorite of the Ring operas. It is Siegfried that really separates one of these three sets from the other two.<br /><br />Bohm: Again we have Windgassen and Brunnhilde in the title roles. They are wonderful, however she over powers him in the final note and he holds it longer than her. Of course this is live, so that is understandable. Wohlfahrt is very annoying as Mime - screaming and shouting, rather than singing. The Woodbird of Erika Koth also grates on my nerves. Bohm's speeds are again faster than the other two. Surprisingly though, he is slower than Solti is Siegfried's fabulous little aria during the first scene, right before Siegfried leaves and Wotan and Mime begin their scene. It's ok and for me that isn't good enough for 'Siegfried.' However, Bohm's whole Cycle is worth it for many other reasons.<br /><br />Solti: This is the great Siegfried. This recording is the reason why 'Siegfried' is my favorite of the four operas. It is absolutely magnificant in every way conceivable. Windgassen and Nilsson are at the height of their powers here and I have never heard the final duet in such ravishing beauty. Stolze is thrilling as Mime, not shouting but singing in a whiny Mimelick tone. Then there's the HUGE added bonus of Joan Sutherland's glorious Woodbird. The final strains here send shivers down my spine, as does the entire opera for that matter. Glorious conducting and playing by the Vienna Philharmonic. I listen to this recording more than anything else.<br /><br />Karajan: Siegfried is what sets the Karajan Ring apart from the other two. When Mime (Stolze) out sings Siegfried (Thomas), you've got problems. Dernesch is wonderful as Brunnhilde, but Thomas ruins this set for me. A huge disappointment.<br /><br />Advantage: Solti, without a doubt.<br /><br />GOTTERDAMMERUNG:<br /><br />Bohm: This is a great recording. The \\"Immolation Scene\\" with Nilsson is wonderful, although I am not sure what was Bohm's big rush here. Brunnhilde on speed. \\"Hagen's Call\\" is marvelous! Pefer the faster speeds, but not in the final scene. Still though - this is a great Gotterdammerung.<br /><br />Solti: Unsurpassable cast, without exception. Vienna Philharmonic is glorious and the \\"Immolation Scene\\" is absolutely incredible. That scene alone makes this the best recording of Gotterdammerung, although the entire reading is phenominal. If there is a weakness in this set, someone please point it out.<br /><br />Karajan: Gutrune (Janowitz) and Ridderbusch (Hagen) are the true stars of this set, which alone raises problems. Dernesch again is great as Brunnhilde, but again when Siegfried and Brunnhilde are overshadowed by less major characters, it's a problem.<br /><br />Advantage: Solti.<br /><br />OVERALL: All three of these Ring's have something to offer. In my opinion, Solti and Bohm are easily the two best out there (of these three). Amazon.com is the ONLY place I have ever seen a critic call Karajan's Ring an \\"essential recording\\". I have even seen Goodall's English language Ring recommended over Karajan on many occasions. Karajan's Ring is beautiful, but it is beauty at every moment at the expensive of drama, and The Ring is a drama. The Ring has moments of high dramatical terror that seem to be downplayed in Karajan's Ring. The drama is there - but in a different way, and a way that doesn't work for me.<br /><br />Bohm's Ring is marvelous. Very fast tempos at times - which I like and don't like. The \\"Immolation Scene\\" is too fast for my preference, but his Walkure is incredible. Much better than Karajan's or Solti's. A live recording gives you an added bonus of hearing the Ring as you would in the opera house. Slight stage and crowd interferences are overshadowed by the glory of this Ring.<br /><br />Solti's Ring overall though, IMHO, is the best out there. The Vienna Philharmonic showcases why they are the world's greatest orchestra, bar none. Like Bohm, Solti's gives us Nilsson and Windgassen. Here they have the advantage of recording in the studio.<br /><br />Lastly, it's a tough choice on which Ring to buy. I would go with Solti or Bohm. For me, the though choice lay in which one I want to listen to at that specific moment.<br /><br />Special notes:<br />This past week, I added Levine's Ring to my collection. After listening to this work thoroughly, I would rank it 3rd (behind Solti and Bohm) and slightly ahead of Bohm. It's my favorite Walkure on disc, an the playing of the Met Orchestra is incredible, and Levine's conducting is brilliant. To those that talk about Levine's \\"plodding\\" tempos, I say his Ring is only 24 minutes longer than Karajan's and 34 minutes longer than Solti's. Over the course of 14 to 15 hours, that literally amouns to seconds per track. It's a non-issue. Cast wise, it is not as strong as Bohm or Solti, but Norman is thrilling as Sieglinde and Morris is my favorite Wotan. In short, Levine succeeded where Karajan failed - in creating a truly beautiful and lyrical Ring. The reason Levine's is a success is because the drama was not sacraficed.<br /><br />I also want to add that since I originally wrote this review (some 2 years ago), I have learned a lot about this work. It's interesting to note, when discussing tempos, that in fact, before the 20th century, Wagner was conducted fast and Bach slow. That trend seems to have reversed itself. In short, Wagner left no metronome markings and very loose tempo descriptions for The Ring. So, no one can say for certain the tempo this work should be conducted at. That is another reason why I can argue that one recording of The Ring is not enough. Every recording brings something different and fascinating to the table. I love Solti's, Bohm's, and Levine's, although I listen to Solti's most often.<br /><br />If you have any questions or comments, feel free to email me at ahaberbush@gmail.comg an \\"essential recording\\".

B000002KHH|5.0|Without a doubt, this is one of the greatest Albums ever made.  Also it is one of my top 5 favorites.   <br /> <br />War Pigs- This lenghty first song defines this album.  Very powerful guitar riffs mixed in with very well played drums and haunting lyrics.  At over 8 minutes, it may be hard to listen to several times in a row but it certainly is one of the best songs I've ever heard.  Great choice for the first song.  8.5/10 <br /> <br />Paranoid-  Radio has beaten this song to death.  I think it is a good song, but slightly over rated.  It's actually my least favorite song on the album which is good considering this song totally rocks.  Great to listen to after War Pigs because its under 3 minutes in length.  Short and sweet is the best way to describe it. 7/10 <br /> <br />Planet Caravan-  A lot of Sabbath fans dont seem to care for this song but i find it very relaxing.  It's as close to a ballad as Sabbath ever got and its a nice chance from the other very heavy songs.  7/10 <br /> <br />Iron Man-  Who hasn't heard this song?  Even though this song has been played on the radio more than probably any rock song, in no way is it over rated.  This song contains one of the greastest guitar riffs of all time.  The lyrics are fantastic.  I believe Iron Man is about how we take advantage of God and his creations and how if we don't change he can easily destoy us all, just my opinion. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />Electric Funeral- My favorite song on the album.  The very powerful, dark sounding guitar riffs stand out the most for me.  The vocals are very eerie as well, give me chills.  This is one of those songs you can keep on repeat for a good hour before you change it.  9.5/10 <br /> <br />Hand of Doom- Second favorite song on the album.  Has a lot of the same qualities ad Electric Funeral.  Hard driving bass lines and guitar riffs make this another great dark metal song. 9/10 <br /> <br />Rat Salad- More than decent, But doesn't appeal to me as much as the other songs.  Although the drum solo goes perfect in the song, I'm just not crazy about drum solos, but then again thats just me 7/10 <br /> <br />Jack the Stripper-  Great way to end this epic album.  Easily as good as the first.  8.5/10 <br /> <br />This album really did have it all.  Great radio quality songs mixed in with excellent album tracks.  I bought this album because I loved Iron Man and War Pigs but after I heard it, I realized this whole album is simply amazing.  Highly Recommended for Dark metal, Heavy Metal, Classic Rock lovers.  If you like this album you will like these other albums as well <br /> <br />Nazareth- Hair of the Dog <br />Led Zeppelin- Physical Graffiti <br />Scorpions- Virgin Killer <br />Blue Oyster Cult- Blue Oyster Cult <br /> <br />All of these are great heavy metal albums and have alot of the same qualities as this one.   <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000TB05A|5.0|U2's  performance  at  Slane  Castle  is  unique  in  that  it  shows  what  the  band  members  are  like  as  people, and  unlike  a  lot  of  their  other  concerts, this  one  relies  almost  completely  on  passion  and  musical  performance  rather  than  extravagent  showmanship.  This  concert  was  destined  to  be  filled  with  passion  since  it  not  only  was  set  in  the  band's  home  turf, but  also  it  was  performed  shortly  after  the  death  of  Bob  Hewson, Bono's  father.  What  is  truly  amazing  about  this  concert  is  how  pleasant  the  band  was  feeling.  In  the  Boston  and  2005  Chicago  concert, the  band  members  rarely  smiled, but  in  this  one  there  is  very  few  moments  when  they  are  not  smiling.  Even  Adam  Clayton  smiles. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Now  on  to  the  set  list.  The  opening  song \\",Elevation,\\"  is  easily  one  of  the  best  opening  tracks  they  could  have  picked.  Unlike  many  of  their  songs, this  one  was  designed  to  be  a  sing  along  and  is  the  perfect  to  get  the  crowd  ready.  \\"Beautiful  Day\\"  is  a  cheerful  song  that  features  excellent  back  up  vocals  and  guitar  riffs  from  the  Edge. \\"Until  The  End  Of  The  World\\"  is  one  of  my  favorites.  This  song  just  flat  out  rocks, and  it  rocks  even  more  in  an  arena.  When  Bono  and  Edge  act  like  buffalos  and  when  Bono  kicks  Edge's  guitar  are  about  the  only  times  we  get  a  showy  performance  in  this  concert.  \\"New  Year's  Day\\"  features  one  of  Adam's  best  performances  and  it's  always  nice  to  see  and  hear  Edge  play  the  piano.  From  there  we  move  to  the  strangely  moving  performance  of  U2's  first  single \\",Out  Of  Control.\\"  In  this  song, Bono  introduces  the  band  and  thanks  all  the  band's  family  members  for  helping  them  get  to  where  they  are  today.  In  this  version  of  \\"Sunday  Bloody  Sunday,\\" U2  actually  seems  Irish, for  once.  Bono's  new  lines  and  the  repetition  of  \\"No  More!\\" along  with  his  enthusiastic  voice  give  this  song  a  new  level  of  power  and  emotion.  He  also  reads  out  the  names  of  the  29  people  killed  in  the  Omagh  terrorist  attack  to  strengthen  this  song's  message  even  more.  Then  we  have  a  surprise  appearence  from  Pop's  \\"Wake  Up  Dead  Man.\\"  This  shorter  and  simpler  version  makes  it  five  times  better  than  the  only  average  studio  version.  We  then  move  from  the  dark  and  depressing  \\"Wake  Up  Dead  Man\\"  to  the  upbeat  and  uplifting  \\"Stuck  In  A  Moment  You  Can't  Get  Out  Of.\\" In  this  song, the  Edge  finally  gets  to  showcase  his  beautiful  vocal  talents, which  is  a  big  bonus  for  an  already  excellent  song. \\"Kite\\"  is  one  of  the  band's  most  underrated  songs  of  all  time.  This  tribute  to  Bob  Hewson  is  a  song  that  can  send  shivers  down  your  spine, and  it  is  even  more  moving  at  this  concert.  Next, we  get  another  surprise  with  the  charming  \\"Angel  of  Harlem.\\"  After  that, we  get  an  even  bigger  surprise  with  \\"Desire.\\"  Although  not  quite  as  loud  and  powerful  as  it's  studio  version, this  song  does  by  no  means  lack  zeal.  It  is  also  nice  to  see  Larry  and  Adam  get  to  join  the  crowd  and  see  Bono  showcase  his  hermonica  skills.  Next, we  have  yet  another  Pop  single \\",Staring  At  The  Sun.\\"  Fortunately, we  have  the  acoustic  version  that  was  recorded  on  the  \\"Please\\"  single  rather  than  the  somewhat  cheesy  Pop  version.  Then  we  have  another  beautiful  but  underrated  song \\",All  I  Want  Is  You.\\"  This  is  where  the  concert  turns  into  an  incredibly  emotional  experience.  After  he  dedicates  this  song  to  his  wife  Alley, Bono  sings  his  heart  out  along  with  Edge  playing  some  of  his  most  beautiful  riffs.  I  love  the  way  Bono  sings  out  ofwith  all  his  anguish  at  the  end  of  this  song  as  it  beautifully  fades  into  \\"Where  The  Streets  Have  No  Name.\\"  There  is  no  way  this  song  could  be  anything  but  amazing  and  the  live  sound  along  with  the  new  lyrics  allow  this  song  to  be  heard  the  way  it  was  meant  to  be. Then  we  get  U2's  anthem  \\"Pride( In  The  Name  Of  Love).  Bono's  voice  may  not  be  as  strong  as  it  used  to  be  here, but  he  still  sings  his  heart  out  and  gives  a  very  passionate  performance.  From  there, we  move  to  \\"Bullet  The  Blue  Sky.\\"  This  song  was  designed  to  be  performed  live  and  Bono's  speeches  in  this  song  really  add  to  its  strenth.  Then  we  have  the  truly  amazing  \\"With  Or  Without  You.\\"  What  can  say  about  this  song  other  than  it  is  beautiful  beyond  comprehension.  Bono's  added  lyrics  and  Edge's  extended  guitar  solo  make  this  song  even  better  than  the  unbelievable  studio  version.  But  the  performance  doesn't  go  down  from  here.  Next  up  is  my  personal  favorite  \\"One.\\"  I  struggled  not  to  cry  during  this  song.  This  song  is  amazing  in  the  studio, but  live  it  is  twice  as  touching.  Again, the  band  extends  the  song  and  adds  lyrics  which  make  it  even  more  stunning.  This  is  argueably  the  most  beautiful  song  I  have  ever  heard  and  to  see  the  band  perform  it  makes  it  so  much  better.  Lastly, we  have  another  song  of  encouragement \\",Walk  On.\\"  This  song, while  not  quite  as  good  of  a  closing  as  \\"40,\\" is  a  fine  way  to  end  an  amazing  concert.  Strangely  enough, it  is  frequently  left  off  the  set  list, so  it  is  a  treat  to  get  to  see  it  performed  live.   <br /> <br /> <br />If  you  are  even  slightly  a  U2  fan, you  should  seriously  consider  buying  this  DVD.  Believe  me, it  will  make  you  appreciate  the  band  and  their  songs  so  much  more.  It  ismuch  better  than  the  Rattle  and  Hum  and  Boston  shows  and  it  is  barely  better  than  the  Vertigo  in  Chicago  show.  It  is  truly  an  emotional  and  breath-taking  concert  that  should  be  experienced  by  everyone  with  any  descent  taste  in  music.
6305907145|4.0|Mansfield Park is a terrific novel and, in this version, a terrific movie, even though i agree with other reviewers that the two are not telling the same story.  The movie is quite honest about saying, in the credits, that it is based on BOTH Mansfield Park and other early writings of Jane Austen.  The result is that the movie follows, for the most part, the story of \\"Mansfield Park the novel\\" except that the character of the novel's heroine Fanny has been replaced by a character more like (what the screenwriters imagine was) Jane Austen herself.  For instance, in the movie Fanny is a writer (she isn't one in the book), and she says lines that are actually from Austen's early History of England and Northanger Abbey.  Other than this massive change in Fanny, however, the plot and rest of the characters are fairly true to those in \\"Mansfield Park the novel.\\"  Yes, Fanny's favorite brother has been replaced with a favorite sister, some lines are changed from the words of one character into the words of a different character, and (what is more unnerving) the unspoken possibility in the novel that Sir Thomas Bertram could own slaves in the West Indies is shouted from the rafters here.  Still, i can't help loving the movie's light touch and terrific performances every time i watch it, and I particularly think that the Crawfords are characterized to perfection.  The movie does a great job showing how the morally suspect Henry and Mary Crawford could nevertheless be attractive enough amid their faults to serve as temptations to Fanny and Edmund. <br /> <br />Now would it have been better if they had just let Fanny be the \\"novel Fanny\\"?  It might have been a better adaptation, but I doubt it would be a better movie.  The struggles of \\"novel Fanny\\" are mostly private--she sits by suffering while everyone else in the book (except Edmund) practically ignores her.  The BBC movie version gets much closer to showing \\"novel Fanny\\"--and the BBC version is nearly unwatchable.   I suspect the reason there's no true--and good--adaptation of \\"Mansfield Park the novel\\" is that the struggles of one girl's insides just can't be easily translated into the visual realm of film.
B0001MDPV8|5.0|Nas is the best still rapping out of NY in my opinion and this album is his masterpiece.  Whether you buy the 10th anniversary edition or not it's a great album.  His flow is untouchable.  No one will ever make an album like this again.  If you like rap you gotta get this album!  After hearing it I went ahead and bought all of his albums which are good but nothing compares to this one...a must have to your collection!
B00069FLC2|5.0|This is a handsomely produced concert with 16x9 widescreen video and Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS sound, in addition to the regular two-channel stereo.  Excellent picture and sound quality.  The Shadows sound great with the arrangements sounding almost exactly like the original audio recordings.  The song selection is great, with group playing their big hits, plus songs when they backed Cliff Richard.  The keyboard player adds string parts, making the songs sound much like the originals.  I can't praise this DVD enough.  If you are a fan of the Shadows, get this DVD.  You won't be disappointed.
B00004VY7F|5.0|I have two favourite movies and one of them is \\"Arizona Dream\\". I can watch it endlessly and very often. You know sometimes you got the mood when you just want to sit and watch something old, something you've seen many times, something very dear and familiar. \\"Arizona Dream\\" works for me at those occasions. Actually I don't like Emir Kusturica and his other works. Paradox, but I adore \\"Arizona Dream\\". It's the movie which seem to absorb all the wisdom of the world and at the same time all its contradictory. In a few words I can tell about the plot that the film is about our dreams. That we all pursue them and doing that we don't notice people around who also have their dreams. And very often our desires obstruct other men's desires. And we can never be happy. I know, maybe it sounds silly but it's not.<br /><br />I can't say what happened to Kusturica in this feature but all 140 minutes of the film are flying very fast and you wish it was endless. Johnny Depp is very different, Vincent Gallo is ingenious as always (just watch his \\"North by Northwest\\" remake scene), Jerry Lewis is hilarious, Faye Dunaway and Lili Taylor make a perfect duo.<br /><br />\\"Arizona Dream\\" is a kind of a movie every time you watch it you find something new, you discover new hidden meanings and layers. You won't get bored with it for sure. If you don't believe me - check imdb ratings. They are quite good and I'm sure none of those who voted loves this film as I do. If there was an ultimate movie for me to recommend for everyone - it'd be \\"Arizona Dream\\" without any doubt. I understand it's not a commercial project but still it's a shame such a brilliant picture is still not out on region 1 DVD.

B00007AJF9|5.0|Although the beginning of this movie when three heretics were being burned alive was rather disturbing, I thought that the overall production of this movie was amazing.  Elizabeth capturese the emotions of the time period and is beautifully filmed.  The score was incredible and really helped to portray the mood of the film.  Cate Blanchett and Joseph Fiennes both played their roles with great accuracy and helped to create a very interesting, informative, and captivating movie.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|anyone who doesn't like this album has NO taste whatsoever.  I loved Ray of Light but this album has now topped that one in my book.  I don't understand why people are so bitter about Madonna... jealousy perhaps?  I love her and as long as she keeps making the albums I'm going to keep buying them
B00001OH7X|5.0|Lodger is every bit as good as Low and Heroes. It's different from those two, though. This one doesn't have any soundscapes or instrumentals. Lodger is also a little more experimental. The first time I heard tracks 2 through 5, I was laughing hysterically and rolling around on the floor, because the songs are so messed up and out there. Whenever you're feeling sad, just listen to those and they'll cheer you right up! Man, they're hilarious!!     It seems like there were 3, maybe 4 hits off of this. I think they were \\"D.J.,\\" \\"Look Back In Anger,\\" and \\"Boys Keep Swinging,\\" but I won't swear to it. \\"Red Sail\\" might have been too. Somebody else on here has probably said them already, anyway.     Every song on here is great, but the standout tracks would probably be \\"Fantastic Voyage,\\" \\"Red Sails,\\" \\"D.J.,\\" \\"Look Back In Anger,\\" \\"Boys Keep Swinging,\\" and \\"Repetition.\\" Track 4, \\"Yes, Ass Sin\\" (Turkish For: Long Live,) is a little bit weaker than the rest of the songs because it's sort of repetative, but it's still far from bad. I highly recommend getting this CD. It might be very experimental, but it's experimental in a good way!
B000BTJDGC|3.0|This COULD have been a much better movie, but suffered due to 2 problems...<br /><br />1) It was told in the reverse timeline whereas we see the ending and then have the story told to us that leads up to that ending.<br /><br />It seems this ALWAYS weakens a movie as compared to telling a story in actual sequence although \\"artsy\\" filmakers love to show off their editing skills in this way.<br /><br />2) The story is told in a court room setting.<br /><br />With the joke our legal system has become today, if you really want to sap the life out of a story, have it told thru the eyes of a bunch of lawyers.<br /><br />I think this could have been a MUCH better film if screenplayed in such a way that we saw the events unfold as they happened and never even got to the court room drama part at all !<br /><br />The court battle between lawyers became the center point of focus with the actual historical events (or variation thereof) relegated to a backdrop story.
B000002GVO|5.0|Hotel California is definitley the Eagles best CD as a whole. It sounds like a greatest hits when you listen to it. Hell, they even pratically put this whole album on disc 2 of Eagles: The Very Best Of. It's that good! My favorite tracks are \\"New Kid In Town,\\" \\"Wasted Time,\\" and \\"The Last Resort,\\" but really every track is excellent. <br /> <br />If you already have the Eagles first Greatest Hits CD, I'd definitley recommend getting this to go with it. If you don't though, I'd probably just go for the double disc Very Best Of compilation. But the two tracks on here that were left off the comilation are really good, so I'd probably still get this. <br />
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|Season 2 is just as good as season 1, if not better. After the season 1 cliffhanger, the season opens with Seth Cohen somewhere in Oregon, refusing to come home to boring and snootie Orange County, now that all the fun has gone - see down to earth Ryan leaving the OC to become a dad back in Chino.<br /><br />The two boys gone, the girls, Marissa and Summer, waste away, one in anger (Summer), the other in pain and addiction (Marissa). To soothe the pain both girls get involved with other people and when the boys Seth and Ryan finally return, the plot thickens. It takes most of the season to sort the various love stories out and on the way we get treated to some very daring television in the Marissa story line and some very funny humor in the Seth/Summer saga.<br /><br />The adults in the story are very entertaining too in this season, especially the diabolical Mrs Cooper, the character we all love to hate ;-)We also get to meet Ryan's older brother, that throws more than one spanner in the works and is very much involved in the obligatory end of season cliffhanger.<br /><br />Waiting for season 2 to know how it all ends :-)
B0000028PI|5.0|This is another one of Alice Cooper's masterpieces. He's had a lot of them too; Killer, Billion Dollar Babies, Welcome To My Nightmare, From The Inside, Dada, etc. The Last Temptation is a continuation of Welcome To My Nightmare, because it tells another story about Steven. The music's a little bit heavier but unfortunatly less theatrical compared to WTMN, and the story is almost as good. I haven't heard Alice Cooper Goes To Hell yet, so I can't compare it to that one. It's another one that has a story about Steven. Anyway, this might be the best rock CD from the 90's. Nirvana's Nevermind and David Bowie's Outside are really good, but they're grunge and industrial, so they don't count. The Last Temptation is one of those albums that you can play twice in a row without skipping any of the songs, and never get tired of it. My most favorite song on here is the ballad \\"It's Me.\\" I like it almost as much as \\"How You Gonna See Me Now.\\" The other nine tracks are excellent too!  <br />
B000BTJDGC|4.0|This movie was to my surprise a very good film about what is supposed to be a true story about a poor, unfortunate young woman who people either said was crazy or possessed. Was she just ill, as doctors called it, or was she truly possessed? Which is right this time- science or religion? This movie showed the battle on each side, and both the lawyers in this film were the two opposing sides pretty well, the problem was they cancelled each other out, making good points on each side which were interesting to hear and observe. To make such a decision I would have found hard. Emily Rose could have been ill, and most probably would say after watching this movie she probably was, but everyone knows there is doubt in the back of all of our minds, that goes beyond our logic, that says there are some things that we just do not know for sure, and this story could have very well been one of those things we could not know. We were not there, we could not know what was going on. Yet it is hard to just automatically believe the story as well, and frightening to even consider.  <br />The acting was pretty well done in this film, I liked the way they played out the film and the story itself will leave you thinking about the situation even after the film, making it a story you'll never truly forget.  <br /> <br />The only problem? I found that they could have shown a little more on Emily Rose. I wanted them to show more of her and what was going on with her, just to shine a little more light on her. Most of the movie is set in the courtroom which is fascinating but I wished they had shown a scene or two more of Emily Rose's tragedy, that's the main reason everyone wanted to see the film so a star goes off from that. Yet I really liked the courtroom part of the film, for it showed the very dilemma of the whole story, and it was a hard one. I think...the jury made the right decision. I feel in my heart of hearts they did. That was not an easy decision, and I think they acted with bothlogic and faith, which indeed was best.
B000AARKOO|3.0|Orlando Bloom plays a blacksmith who has tragically lost his family and then is persuaded to fight in the Crusades by his father, who is played by Liam Neeson.  Unfortunately, after Neeson dies, the quality of the acting goes down throughout the film.  The \\"holy\\" war is fought with the usual bloody battle scenes, and the characters neatly divided into good and evil (some on both sides) for which Hollywood is famous.  The film has action, a love interest, fairly accurate history, but unfortunately not much heart.  The leading characters are never engaging enough to cause the viewer to really care about the outcome, and thus the movie becomes lots of sound and fury.  The one point that it does make is that nothing much has changed in 1000 years--Christians and Muslims are still fighting over control of the Holy Land.
B0002VYQ2U|3.0|It is a nice peice of work, but it is more country music than jazz.  However, I liked the DVD very much. I removed two stars because I expected to listen to jazz, not country.
B00005JOFO|2.0|I thought tonight I was going to see the best movie of the year.  In fact I don't feel this movie deserves a single award.  With a year with amazing films like walk the line, capote, syriana, and Good night, and good luck.......brokeback mountain is simply just a decent movie, but not a good one.  And I think this movie could be great, but I don't feel Heath or Jake have the acting chops too pull it off.  The problem is they were acting and they didn't become the role like Joaquin Phoenix or Hoffman do.   <br /> <br />And I think the media is overhyping the gay element to make the movie sound extraordinary and groundbreaking while it's just another drama I would normally overlook without all the buzz.
0440211727|5.0|The storyline grabbed my attention immediately.  A young black girl is raped, beaten and left for dead in a sleepy Southern town, setting off a volatile chain of events that wake the entire town of Clanton Mississippi out of its innocence and brings it into the forefront of the country.  And not in a good light, either. <br /> <br />The characters are wonderful.  Jake Brigance is the young lawyer who is determined to save his client, Carl Lee Hailey from the gas chamber after he killed the two rednecks charged with the brutal attack of his daughter.  Aiding Brigance in this damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't case is Harry Rex Vonner, a shady divorce lawyer noted for doing anything and everything to win (legal or not;) Lucien Wilbanks (Brigance's mentor) who is a  disbarred attorney who is also noted for his activist stance and last but not least, Ellen Roark - an idealistic 2nd year law student from Ole Miss who isn't afraid to take on anyone to make a case. <br /> <br />It's not an easy road for these legal eagles to travel.  They are risking life and limb - literally - and waking up long napping prejudices that explode in the form of the Ku Klux Klan.  If you've never read any of John Grisham's novels before, this is the one to begin with.  It''s not only a page-turner, but you won't be able to get the story or the characters out of your mind.   And to be fair about it, out of the movie versions made of Grisham's novels, the movie version of this novel is most faithful to the book.  Even if you've seen the film, read the book.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|The best sci-fi since the series
B00009W0U4|5.0|I just saw \\"Irreversible\\" for the first time yesterday and I must say I can't get it off my mind. Very brutal and very demanding of the viewer but worth it! I was extremely uncomfortable during the rape scene- almost to the point of feeling sick, but at the end of the movie I felt so glad I endured the whole thing. What an amazing look into fate and destiny. Delivers a very true but dismal message of \\"Time Destroys all things.\\" Watching this movie is definitly a brain-changing event. I can't describe exactly what I mean. You have to see it for your self. Please be adventurous and forget all those dogmas you've been taught. Watch this movie with an open mind and I guarantee your gonna feel like you got off a 2 hour rollcoaster! Everyone likes to have that short moment of violence or sex in a movie. Many filmmakers just depict rape as a horrible 30 second event. Most American movies are like getting on a rollcoaster for 2 minutes - It's exciting, ok, but you were safe and get off easy. Trying riding a rollercoaster (Irreversible) for 2 hours. WOW! that's all I can say WOW! I will be looking into other foreign films now. If they can take me to such heights with violence and horror I can't even imagine how amazing it will be to see such filmmakers tackle other subjects.
B0002OERI0|4.0|Okay.  Well, first off I would like to say I am a English teenager and I own all the Green Day albums.  I've got some stuff to say about some of the reviews I've read on here, because I'v had enough of people insultng this band because of stupid reasons.  If you don't like the music, that's fine.  But some of the things people are saying are just stupid. <br /> <br />I didn't listen to American Idiot because of the political messages or whatever, I listened to it because I like the music.  Billie Joe may know nothing about politics but he has his opinions, and if he want to sing about it, then fine.  And as for saying the only reason they put out a political album was because that is what sells, that is a load of rubbish.  Most of the music these days is mindless crap, so if political music sells, it's because it's different.  And lots of their earlier music comments on social and political affairs in America, so this album is hardly just a one-off. <br /> <br />One reviewer said that punk rock today sucks, and kids try to be punk or emo because it's the fashion.  Green Day are not emo.  And it's hardly their fault if their music has become hugely popular, and punk is in fashion now.  A lot of people act punk because Green Day are 'in' right now.  But Green Day KNOW that.  Billie Joe said \\"A guy walks up to me and asks 'What's Punk?'. So I kick over a garbage can and say 'That's punk!'. So he kicks over the garbage can and says 'That's Punk?', and I say 'No that's trendy'\\"   <br /> <br />What Green Day are trying to teach is that punk is not a steroetype.  Being punk is basically being different.  Being an indivuidual.  Finding your own niche in the world, and being your own person.  Listen to Minority, for goodness sake.   <br /> <br />And bands don't all sound the same now.  Green Day has been around for a long time, and if bands sound like them, it's because they copied them, not the other way around! <br /> <br />The reason why so many people are against Green Day is because of stupid fans who say stuff like 'Billie Joe for President'.  Yeah, do that and ruin your country.  Or people who say if you want to rebel then listen to Green Dday.  That's just stupid.  I made a point of avoding this band for years because everyone was listening to them, but then I couldn't help it.  I listened to Nimrod and now I own all ther albums. <br /> <br />So basically, what I'm saying is if you dislike them because you don't like the music, then fair enough.  Everyone has different taste.  But don't insult them because punk is now a sterotype because they are so popular, or because you don't agree with their political statements. <br /> <br />Just enjoy their music!   <br /> <br />Now about the album!  American Idiot is a good album, even if some of the songs are overplayed.  I prefer their earlier stuff, but this is still pretty damn good and Jesus of Suburbia is fantastic! <br /> <br />So go for it!  Buy the album if you like their music, not because everyone else.  I don't agree with a lot of what Green Day say because I'm not a rabid fan girl, but it doesn't mean I can't enjoy their music.  So now I'm going to go and do just that!
B00005JOGU|4.0|Although he was a celebrated author, I have to admit my initial familiarity with Truman Capote came from his frequent appearances during the 1970's on \\"The Tonight Show\\" with Johnny Carson, as well as his silly appearance as duplicitous millionaire Lionel Twain in Neil Simon's 1978 \\"Murder by Death\\". Capote's effete manner and often patronizing comments (e.g., he opined that all actors were basically stupid) made such a strong impression on me that it was not until much later that I realized he wrote such gems such as \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\", \\"The Grass Harp\\", \\"The Thanksgiving Visitor\\", and of course, his seemingly atypical masterwork, \\"In Cold Blood\\". It is the intensive research and writing of this latter work, a self-proclaimed \\"non-fiction novel\\" published to great acclaim in 1965, which is the basis of this well-crafted though sometimes slowly paced movie.<br /><br />For those who have not read \\"In Cold Blood\\" or seen the stark 1967 film adaptation directed by Richard Brooks, the true-life story focuses on Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, a pair of drifters who break into the home of a Kansas farm family in November 1959 based on a rumor that they had $10,000 stashed away. Upon discovering that the family had no money on hand, Smith and Hickock systematically killed the four members of the family.  First-time director Bennett Miller recreates much of the book's plot, including the gory crime, within the context of the movie. On a broader level, this film focuses on Capote's journey of over four years in chronicling the story until the inevitable ending, and in the meantime getting to know the killers intimately, especially the more enigmatic Smith. Actor Dan Futterman, familiar from his guest turns on \\"Will and Grace\\" and \\"Sex in the City\\", has written a delicately balanced screenplay that highlights the contradictory forces with which Capote was grappling in getting his story on paper.<br /><br />Although Miller's direction and Futterman's script are both strong for rookie efforts, the key to the film's effectiveness lies in the performances. In a startling transformation, Philip Seymour Hoffman inhabits Capote from the most subtle mannerism to his inner soul. Always a fine character actor, Hoffman brings his dead-on impersonation to a level of consciousness that exudes just the right shadings of narcissism, vulnerability and self-destruction. From the snippets of Capote regaling cocktail party guests in Manhattan with his stories to his useless wardrobe name-dropping in Kansas, there is no question in Hoffman's performance that Capote is a man in love with himself. As author Harper Lee, Capote's closest confidante and research partner on the killings, the always watchable Catherine Keener unaffectedly presents the sturdiness of her plain-spoken character, and their close, painfully honest relationship is believable.<br /><br />The other striking performance is provided by Clifton Collins Jr., who brings out the alternating coldness and vulnerability in Smith, especially as his character naively and desperately comes to regard Capote as his friend. The prison cell scenes between Hoffman and Collins have an intriguing, disturbing charge that subconsciously seems to point to the homoerotic nature of their relationship. Smaller roles are filled expertly - Chris Cooper in familiar territory as Sheriff Alvin Dewey and Bruce Greenwood as Capote's patient lover, author Jack Dunphy - though their scenes feel truncated compared to the rest of the story. In fact, the film feels rushed toward the end as Capote is obviously deeply affected by the events and his own culpability in the killers' fate. I only wish there was a greater sense of a denouement to the film, but regardless, the film is certainly worth seeing for Hoffman's masterful performance.orts, the key to the film's effectiveness lies in the performances.

B000AYQJJ2|3.0|When this film was released I saw it at the drive-in. I enjoyed it then, but part of the good experience was the crowd we had in the vehicle and the partying going on, not the quality of the production. Harrison was my hero, and with the recent release of \\"All Things Must Pass,\\" the most popular rock star of the time.    For years I have awaited the release of this production on DVD; my memory of the original was fading but positively affected by my recent experience with the great \\"Concert for George.\\" But this package is a disappointment, both in the picture quality and lack of organization on stage amongst the players.     Yes, it is fine fun seeing George again in his prime, and Leon Russell brings back a smile, especially his outfit. But, except for the indefatigable Billy Preston, all of the participants seem tentative and somehow restrained, as if they had failed to show up for the rehearsal. And though the packaging for this product is well done, it's also quite expensive.     Watch it at your friend's house, if possible; you will probably not be in a hurry to get your own copy, and you will have saved enough to get \\"The Concert for George,\\" which is more than worth the money.
B000AA305M|1.0|I am a HUGE David Grey fan and was really looking forward to purchasing this for not only myself but also for two others on my X-mas list.  But after the havoc the Carlos Santana CD created on my computer, there is *no way* I'd do that to myself or my friends. (I didn't even know to look for the copyright protected symbols on a CD case until AFTER I put the Santana CD on my computer/iPod, what a mess.  Now, I look every time, at every CD I'm thinking of purchasing) So Sony and David Gray can keep the CD and I'll keep my computer safe. <br /> <br />Sony, show some integrity, recall the CD's with copy-right protection and don't put it on future releases <br />
0800196341|5.0|The fact that this film is currently unavailable is a dark statement about our culture. Surely one of the great events in all of cinematography, and definitely the finest Shakespeare movie production ever made, the deficiency of availability either in VHS or DVD speaks volumes about how leisure time is spent in America.    Acquire this film that so beautifully and penetratingly interprets Shakespeare's most powerful play. The production leaves no word omitted; and the acting is so superb, with enunciation of the lines so contemporary, that passages hitherto cloudy become easily understood and meaningful. A banquet of ideas served to perfection, it is. Genius Branaugh meets genius Shakespeare.
B000025SJ8|5.0|It's easy to dismiss this album as at first listen it sounds like cacaphonous, disorganized amateurish noise, and it probably is, although with each listen you can hear the variety among the tracks, the precision in timing, and the layered complexity in the production. THis is the kind of accidental brilliance that rises only a few times in our civilization, akin to the Sex Pistols, Ramones, Clash, Sabbath or Stones. IN terms of the Black Metal cannon, it is arguably better than Mayhem's magnum opus (de mysterium), although the history behind the album is unsettling. Fortunately for this album, its production values and uniqueness transcend its history.
B000AADYRQ|4.0|I am one of those many newcomers to Death Cab, thanks to their major airplay song, \\"Soul Meets Body\\".  Two comments, one for potential listeners and another for the band. <br /> <br />Potential listeners - if you like your songs mellow and deep (Marillion comes to mind), Death Cab is for you.  Within \\"Plans\\", you will hear a rarity of meaningful lyrics and stories - literal and figurative.  With deep, meaningful songs and an incredible hit song, they easily earn 4 stars. <br /> <br />Death Cab - the band clearly has the intelligence, creativity and musical talent to explore beyond their \\"mellow boundaries\\". It's no coincidence that \\"Soul Meets Body\\" struck paydirt.  It's one of the best songs I've ever heard - catchy and melodic tunes coupled with great lyrics, all the while never becoming too predictable.  I WANT MORE OF THIS!  Sorry old time fans, but let's see Death Cab give more of it a try.  (GASP!) They might even become more popular!
B0000009SG|5.0|I am not sure I am sophisticated enough musically to fully appreciate what Zappa accomplished in his lifetime, but I know what I like, and Overnite Sensation is something I adore.<br /><br />To the degree that it pleases the ears, Overnite Sensation also tickles the funny bone.<br /><br />Some say Zappa was \\"selling out\\" to commercial success with this album.  I don't think so, but if he did, I came along willingly.<br /><br />All best.  Lee
B000AJJNPY|5.0|Quite simply, this album is awesome. It's shining, cheerful, deep, it is a moment of childish beauty. Words don't matter, but the emotions when hearing such amazing songs are just almost unbearable. Very powerful. <br />After seeing them live, them the whole thing makes even more sense. And after listening to the record again and again, the sensation is overwhelming and tears can even fall if the moment is more sensitive. <br />It is a perfect album, there are no mistakes. The only problem is that you might feel a little strange if you listen to it and you are thinking about your own life...it can turn into a very emotional experience.
1932100385|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book. The author has extensive references from may prestigious medical journals and some interesting personal research. I agree with some of the other opinions that this is a voice which needs to be heard. But I would also offer some words of  caution. <br /> <br />The book moves effortlessly from evidence-based fact into opinions.  Conclusions are drawn which extend beyond those which can reasonably be extracted from the data with a high degree of certainty. For example, the data on casein in animal studies is interesting. Also, the anecdotal evidence from humans is interesting. However, the data does not appear to clearly support the conclusions the author makes regarding hip fracture risk and cancer promotion in humans. Even the graphs are a little misleading. While the data suggesting low animal protein is compelling, the suggestion of total avoidance is NOT supported.  <br /> <br />Also the author becomes almost flamboyant at times. His stories of interactions with others on important nutritional committees seems to suggest this. <br /> <br />Despite these limitations, I recommend this book to others. It has been especially useful for those who have never considered the dangers of the \\"western diet\\" and need a wake up call. <br /> <br />Robert Hart, MD

B0001GF2DS|4.0|The stated purpose of the 2004 extended English version is to present the film as Leone intended it to be shown, which it does magnificently, but also proves that the director is not always the best judge of how to edit his work.  The original 1998 restoration of the American cut is clearly a superior edit which moves the story along at an exciting pace.  I disagree with the editors of the extended version that the missing scene of Tuco picking up his bandito buddies was necessary for continuity in the following scene--after all, there's no explanation for the appearance of Angel Eyes in the Union army camp, or the appearance of his 6 associates later--there's plenty of mystery in this film that needs no explanation, mystery is its great charm. <br /> <br />While the audiovisual restoration of the 2004 extended version is quite beautiful, especially the soundtrack, I miss the slightly warm color palate of the 1998 version and the blown-out highlights which make us really feel the heat of the desert.  Too much perfection is the bane of digital formats, and in this restoration too much perfection has damaged the artistic effect we've become accustomed to with this film. <br />Nonetheless, if you love this film you must see this version and all of the related materials included in the set.  After all, amigo, there are those who merely watch a film and some who really dig it...
B0007GAERG|1.0|I liked this CD at first, but now I'm sick of it. The CD is actually pretty good, but the problem is that all tracks sound the same! There is no variety or any daring music to be found. It's a solid CD that you'll like, but if you want some daring music buy Madonna's Confessions On A Dancefloor. It is teh best album of the year by the best selling female artist of all time WORLDWIDE. Sorry ''Mimi'' (what a cute name but u are a bitch) but you still can learn a lot from the queen of pop, MADONNA!
B000B7BRMM|4.0|Diana Krall does an excellent job at covering an array of Christmas classics.

There is just about everything on this record that will not disappoint anyone looking for that  frolicking in the holiday splendor type of song, such as \\"Jingle Bells\\" and \\"Winter Wonderland\\".  Or if you are looking for more sentimental holiday favorites, \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas,\\" \\"White Christmas,\\" \\"What Are You Doing New Year's Eve,\\" the ever so popular, Mel Torme's \\"Christmas Song,\\" Krall's versions will get you into the holiday mood.<br /><br />Krall and the Clayton/Hamilton Jazz Orchestra provide the holiday fair with their upbeat tunes as well as lush renderings of slower ones that complement this exceptional collection.
B00005Q66T|5.0|So does it matter not all good tracks are included??? Does that make the album worse??? NO. You should see thjis as an individual album and not think of the other tracks! Then it would get 5 stars of everyone. Don0t listen to the bad reviewers, this CD is a must-have. Even if you hate Madonna, it's a classic CD.
B0002EXH40|3.0|I was bashing the remade versions of \\"Peace Sells.. \\" and \\"So far so good..so what?\\"  and I haven't changed opinion about that, but I must say that this remastered version of Youthanasia is awesome.

B000002KB8|5.0|Review number 227. Originally unleashed upon an unexpected world of young hard rock listeners in 1970. Was, of course the band's chilling debut record. Many say that this lp was one of THE most influential heavy rock albums of all time. I believe it. I remember hearing about HOW Sabbath's very first tour literally shook the walls of mid-sized concert venues. Your CD player will register this disc as having five tracks, but there seems to be ten actual songs, many of them run together. From the stunning opener (complete with church bells-a-ringing) the band's namesake \\"Black Sabbath\\" to \\"Behind The Wall Of Sleep\\", the blues-like \\"The Wizard\\" and \\"Sleeping Village\\", one gets to fully experience vintage doom metal here. I mean,those current stoner / doom  bands you hear of today are nice, but THIS is the real thing. Most highly recommended.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I wasn't expecting to much of this album. As soon as I walked out the CD shop I thought: Why the **** did I buy this album??? But when I put it in my CD player I was surprised. Maybe God helped me buying that CD. My favourites are Future Lovers, Isaac and Push.
B000BJS4SU|2.0|...When I heard that Mayer was putting out a blues album, i was very anxious to hear what he could do, especially with the \\"trio\\" aspect, which implied a purist approach. I like that. But therein lies the problem. I had heard about a BLUES album. This is not a blues album. As the artist clearly indicated, this is a pop album intended to introduce blues elements. John Mayer knows his audience very well. To put out something raw and traditional like a genuine blues guitar album would place Mayer in the poor house. I commend him on this album for emphasizing these elements. And although the album does not appeal to those outside the mainstream, i hope we may soon see some real blues from the young pop-star. Frankly, the guy doesn't need to lay down any more groundwork in the radio-friendly arena if he's ready to live up to any of the guitar legend allusions concerning his technique. Some of which i believe absurd, as many compare him to stevie Ray. Even Mayer knows thats wrong.

B00000DGUG|2.0|Not much to say here but this album seems to have sophomore jinx written all over it. Jagged Little Pill, and then Alanis' albums after SFIJ are truly remarkable and stand up so well to repeated listenings. <br />However this, with the exceptions of Thank U, So Pure and Joining You, is almost like a repititious drone, unremarkable melodies to say the least, making it hard for me to reach for this CD when I want to enjoy Alanis. <br />Completists will naturally want this and there are a handful of good tracks as I mentioned, but for all others, there is far better Morissette fare out there from which to choose.

This is also a good movie for kids because is is one of the only Monty Python movies rated PG. This is very well done and is my favorite movie I ever saw.

B00000J7RZ|3.0|Jennifer Lopez - On The 6 (her first album) <br /> <br />The songs from On The 6 certainly gave Jennifer a brighter future. She's went on to sell millions worldwide, and achieve platinum certifications. The first single from the album, If you had my love, also Jen's debut single, even achieved number one. The other two singles, Waiting for tonight and Feelin' so good are also nice. Most of the first half of the album is great, it's when you get to the second half you start to skip tracks. The best songs are It's not that serious, Baila, If you had my love, and Waiting for tonight, though I find myself skipping certain songs: Open Off My Love, Talk about us, Promise me you'll try and Do you know where you're going to. They are rather boring. So yeah, this album is 50:50. Jen's voice is also poor quality on some songs.
B000025XKM|5.0|The entire album consists of one man, an acoustic guitar, and a little bit of piano.  Most of the songs don't top 3 minutes, and the whole thing doesn't top 30.  The album probably cost less to record than most artists spend on room service at the Hilton.  Heck, there's even a couple of mistakes here and there in the guitar playing.<br /><br />And yet, despite all this, I have absolutely no hesitation whatsoever in saying that this is one of the most brilliant and complete albums ever made.  What Nick Drake did on this album is just monumental, and despite its super-exiguous nature, this album just has so much to it, and proves to be more and more rewarding with time.  Nick was no virtuoso musician by any means, but he was an awe-inspiring songwriter who knew how to entrance your senses with a simple 2-minute song.  His distinctive, smoky voice just had an indescribable warmth and coziness to it that perfectly complemented his entrancing guitar melodies.<br /><br />He also does a magnificent job of keeping the songwriting interesting and diverse. With an album like this, it could potentially become monotonous, but not so here.  From the bouncy \\"Free Ride\\", to the dark and haunting \\"Things Behind the Sun\\", to the infectious piano-adorned title track, there are plenty of different moods, shades, and textures to keep you listening, and keep you coming back.  This is a great album for driving through the countryside, or sitting in front of the fireplace on a cold night, or just hanging around doing nothing in particular.<br /><br />This is just a really spectacular and timeless piece of music.  Nick Drake's career may have been brief, his ending tragic, his success too late, but with \\"Pink Moon\\", he has made a bigger impact than he or anyone else could ever have imagined.
B000026OHN|5.0|As some of the reviwers said I also agree that this is the best performance of the TWC. I don't know if Bach would concieve the speed and magical colors that Richter achieves but Bach is a box of of surprises and if you've got the the talent you can find it all; this is what Richter is able to do. And he shares with us Bach's possibilities, and show us that he (Bach) is the the Master of all ages.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Opeth has to be one of the best (if not the) bands to emerge to this new millenium. Mikael kerfeldt is for my opinion, the best metal singer of these days. Martin Lopez (drums) and Peter Lindgren (guitars) are very talented players too.  This is Opeth's 8th studio album and yet a great one. I consider this to be a top 3 Opeth album (my fav album is 'My Arms, Your Hearse'), its a concept album. Also their debut with keyboardist Per Wiberg. Its an 65 mins epic, with 4 songs over 10 mins (Ghost of Perdition, The Baying of the Hounds, Reverie/Harlequin Forest and The Grand Conjuration) and 3 acoustic songs. Right, song ratings...    Ghost of Perdition (10/10): The albums opens strongly with this 10 mins (I think) song, the solo is great, the drums, everything kicks here.    The Baying of the Hounds (10/10): Its even longer than the previous, and also heavier, my 2nd fav song on the album.    Beneath the Mire (7.5/10): It has a great keyboard intro, it isn't very memorable and bit drags on, but I usually don't skip this.    Atonement (9/10): Acoustic song, starts with a soft-ballad like guitar solo, the piano is a bit repetitve in the end but this is not bad at all.    Reverie/Harlequin Forest (11/10): The best song on the album. It starts with heavy guitar riffs, within the 3rd min it becomes heavier and the death metal vocals join toward it, it has also has great interlude and solo.     Hours of Wealth (9/10): Another acoustic song, pretty much like 'Atonement'. Nothing really special here but a cool song though.    The Grand Conjuration (10/10): Another 10 mins epic, it has great keyboards and doublebass drumming. Everything is excellent here.    Isolation Years (N/A): Eh... don't really care for this song, its just Mikael sings over soft guitar playing, nothing more.    And now, is this the best album of 2005? I mean, c'mon, how can you people prefer Coldgay's overrated and boring new POS to this epic masterpiece????  2005 was a great year for music (I'm not talkingabout the mainstream crap like Ashlee Simpson). Nevermore, Judas Priest, Dream Theater, Bruce Dickinson, Arch Enemy etc released great albums, but this is the most melodic and original album of this year, so I choose this to be the best.  If you like metal so get this now!    LONG LIVE OPETH!!

B000BKVQTS|3.0|If Terry Gilliam, the director of \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail,\\" \\"Time Bandits,\\" \\"Brazil,\\" \\"The Adventures of Baron Munchausen,\\" and \\"The Fisher King,\\" wants to make a movie about the Brothers Grimm in which their fairy tales turn out to be real, then that should be a real winner.  So the question on the table is why the 2005 film \\"The Brothers Grimm\\" is not a winner.  When I sat down to watch this film I was hoping for something along the lines of \\"Ever After: A Cinderella Story\\" (in which the brothers appear in the prologue) or even \\"Sleepy Hollow,\\" but what we end up with is much more in the spirit of \\"Ghostbusters,\\" and not in a good way.<br /><br />The initial misstep in this adventure comes when it is decided that Wilhelm (Matt Damon) and Jacob Grimm (Heath Ledger) will not simply be nonbelievers, but that instead they would be con-artists who exploit the believe of the common folk in witches and other things that go bump in the night (\\"Eliminating Evil Since 1812\\" is the film's tagline).  The fairy tales do appear, but they are not really integrated into the story in any significant way by screenwriter Ehren Kruger, who has previously written \\"Scream 3,\\" \\"The Ring,\\" \\"The Ring Two\\" and \\"Skeleton Key.\\"  This resume comes into play because looking it over I was thinking that the story should have been more along the lines of \\"The Ring\\" films rather than trying for the tongue-in-cheek approach of the \\"Scream\\" films.  This is especially true since the way the images from the video in \\"The Ring\\" were integrated into the story were rather successful, which proves Kruger can do such things, but chose not to do so to great effect in this film.<br /><br />The look of the film is, as you would expect with Gilliam as the director, to be sumptuous.  Guy Hendrix Dyas did the production design and set decoration (the latter with Judy Farr), with art direction by Andy Thomson and Frank Walsh, and costumes designed by Gabriella Pescucci and Carlo Poggioli, all of whom do most commendable work generally worthy of Oscar consideration (I do not like the Grimm's armor only because it is the chief symbol of their work a con-men, which I have faulted above).  Having golden boys Damon and Ledger as the titular siblings probably helped get the film made and marketed, but I wonder if having unknowns would have helped make the story they chose to tell her work, since you have hero types playing against type for most of the film and for the most part their comic ineptitude falls flat for me.<br /><br />Anyhow, the Grimms are revealed to be charlatans by Delatombe (Jonathan Pryce), who is Napoleon's representative in Germany.  Instead of executing the con artists he dispatches them in another way, sending them to the village of Marbaden.  Children there have gone missing and the nearby forest appears to be haunted.  Delatombe sends along Cavaldi (Peter Stormare), his master of torture to make sure the Grimms do not run away.  Apparently the Frenchman thinks the Grimms will either figure out the scam or die in the process.  Of course the forest turns out to really be enchanted and is ruled by the 500-year-old Mirror Queen (Monica Bellucci).  If not for the lovely huntswoman, Angelika (Lena Headey), this movie would be a lot shorter.  When the brothers worry more about romancing the huntswoman than fearing the queen I was again thinking that this film was simply playing its hand the wrong way.<br /><br />There was a really good film about the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm that could have been made and if Gilliam could not get it done I suspect it will be several generations before someone ventures into this specific territory again.  But there are such works as the Stephen Sondheim musical \\"Into the Woods,\\" Orson Scott Card's novel \\"Enchanted,\\" and others you can certainly name yourself if you are fans of the genre that make it clear we should have been treated to something so much better than this tale of \\"The Brothers Grimm.\\"do most commendable work generally worthy of Oscar consideration (I do not like the Grimm's armor only because it is the chief symbol of their work a con-men, which I have faulted above).

B000002LJW|5.0|a interesting  Clapton's album! A good mix of  great songs pop with blues, ballads and rock !!This albun  is between his 5 best works!
B000002JSN|4.0|9 and 1/2 times out of 10 when u ask people what their fav zepplin album is  they usually will say IV or otherwise known as \\"The Stairway Album\\", some critics will say Houses Of The Holy was their best work and one could argue that was their most \\"pop\\" album. Still others who arent so caught up in the whole \\"stairway\\" hype point to Zepplin 2 as their most bluesy. For me Ill have to say Physical Graffiti was  the best of the lot, in fact if u take all 8 of the studio albums  zepplin released while John Bonham was alive  graffiti best represents all the different styles they ever attempted.   <br />Most of In Through The Out door was keyboard heavy, well listen to \\"trampled underfoot\\" and \\"in the light\\" and theres plenty of keyboards on both of em \\"trampled\\" being the funkier of the two , it certainly proved that zepplin were white boys who could play that funky music. How Houses of the Holy the songs , got left off of the album of the same name is mystry to me but it would have had no trouble fitting in there,  on Graffiti it sounds like a pop standout  and truth is both it as well as\\"the rover\\" never quite worked for me, perhaps because i wasnt around for woodstock,  all of robert plant's hippy, dippy,  tolken like lyrics never did anything for me.  <br />After stairway, almost everyone agrees that \\"kashmir\\" was zepplin at their epic peek , and though they would later do achilles last stand for the Presence album 2 years later, that songs tended to have moments where it just sounded like the band was running in place. With kashmir this sounds more like ur taking a journey,  treking through the desert, staring up into the sky and seeing all the wonders of the stars. for a band that got accused of stealing alot of blues standards and passing them off as their own, when  led zep  did come up with something trully original it could sound timeless, one song that that i dont think gets nearly as much attention as it should is \\"ten years gone\\"  for a double album if all the other songs on here had trully sucked  I would still purchase it just for \\"ten years gone\\" because of the combination of jimmy page's gazillion guitar notes in the song and the heartbreaking vocals of robert plant, its been said that this was suppose to had been writen bout a real woman who robert had a breif romance with before he became famous, if thats true u can tell that it must had been special and anyone who has had a relationship end can relate to the feelings being put out <br />But just before you start to think the boys have wussed out, it all ends with \\"sick again\\" which is just a flat out by the numbers, \\"i know you want me because im a huge rock star\\" groupie song,  but between the riffs of jimmy page and the drum breaks of john bonham this song kicks harder then anything that would come out of the l.a. metal scene just a decade later. <br />So if your brand new to zepplin  and wanna know what all the fuss is about and hear a great band just before their excess caught up with em this is where to start all wrapped up graffiti <br />BUY THE DAMM RECORD!
B000002H33|5.0|After their outstanding \\"Ride The Lightning\\" album METALLICA unearthed their third long player \\"Master Of Puppets\\" in 1986. As everybody knows, the gentlemen Hetfield and co. had forged a masterpiece of pure genius. Just like the previous album \\"Master Of Puppets\\" became a classic and additionally one of the best Thrash Metal albums of all times.     Every banger will get spasms in the neck muscles when just reading song titles such as Battery\\", \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\" or \\"Damage, Inc.\\". This album only contains classics. No matter if the just mentioned songs or any other. Each track is to the point and could justify the purchase and the praises. Just like on \\"Ride The Lightning\\" METALLICA do not just step on the pedal. With \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\", which most probably everybody could shout along with right away, or the slow paced \\"Leper Messiah\\" METALLICA showed that they were masters of their trade in every tempo. With \\"Orion\\" they, of course, also had an instrumental on board again. Besides \\"The Call Of Ktulu\\" the best of the band's history.     What strikes on \\"Master Of Puppets\\" are the long playing times of the single tracks. No song clocks in at under five minutes and still never gets boring in any way. On their 1986 work METALLICA are even more flexible, catchy and still more progressive and variable than before. I don't think that there is much more to say. I think that all of you know the songs and know what this is about. The album, of course, has been produced by Flemming Rasmussen, who had always given METALLICA a top sound. The lyrics also deserve a thumbs up. Just like the cover hints at a central topic, being war and the terror and horrors it brings to the people.       In the more recent past METALLICA have not exactly released brilliant stuff anymore, but this will never be able to affect \\"Master Of Puppets\\". The album will remain a true classic for all times. Simply because the album sounds absolutely timeless. After the tragic death of bassist extraordinaire Cliff Burton (R.I.P. Metalbrother) to my ears METALLICA never managed to reach the quality of their first three albums anymore. If it has been Cliff or not, everything that came afterwards was between \\"ok\\" to \\"strong\\", but nothing could reach \\"Master Of Puppets\\" anymore until today. And I think that METALLICA won't ever be able to top off this one anymore. A classic until the end of time.
B00000DHZJ|3.0|Honestly what one person at a record company likes to call a \\"greatest hits\\"  most people would call \\"cash in\\"  truth is  greatest hits arent usually made up of a artist's absolute best work that may give a casual music listener a complete picture of their work, instead its mainly just all the songs that got released as singles on the radio all put together . Now that we live in the music download era and pretty much anyone looking to spend 90 cents per song can put together anykind of \\"best of\\" they so choose of an artist, it makes u wonder if the future of record company issued \\"greatest hits\\" is limited.  <br />Course in 1998 Napster was non-existant when the Hendrix family released their own greatest hits of jimi hendrix after winning control of his estate. Of course by then there had been a few hendrix greatest hits  but the big difference was that the songs were all remastered from their orignal 24-track reels and thankfully mitch mitchell's orignal drum parts were left intact for \\"Angel\\"  unlike on 1995's Voodoo Soup cd where some one came up with the great idea (yeah right) of erasing his drum parts and replacing them with someone else's .. <br />One problem i have is how could \\"burning of the midnight lamp\\" be left out, its not like it hadnt be released as a single, least it was in england and jimi himself even thought it was one of his best songs you could had traded in  \\"hey joe\\" for that since that wasnt even an original hendrix song and i doubt too many people would had cared. and besides nearly half of the 20 songs all came from are you experienced, now as good as  that album may be if ur trying to give a new fan a sample of jimi's work as to entice them to pursue the rest of his catalog you could pread out some the output a lil better,   now one  thing which is a pleasent surprise is that they included songs which werent even released while jimi was still alive yet made it out to later albums,  \\"freedom\\" and \\"night bird flying\\"  both give some hints as to the new direction jimi was going for in a more soulful and earthier sound. All and all a fairly decent start for beginners only everyone else would have the full albums by now but for rookies BUY THE DAMM RECORD
0393312836|3.0|In A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess, the plot follows a young 15-year old juvenile delinquent through his numerous felonious acts that his gang, Dim, Pete, Georgie, commits. In this gang, while committing a crime, Alex is caught by police, eventually sent to prison, and force to undergo a new experimental rehabilitation technique, in which he is forced to watch violent film clips, in order to \\"brainwash\\" him into abhorring. Upon his relief from prison, Alex in turns becomes the victim of his old gang and the violent acts thrown upon him are those that eventually lead him to his death. <br />In my opinion, I found this book to be very interesting and very powerful in the point the author is trying to make about karma and tells stories of crime that really do happen in society today. I really liked the beginning and the unique twists including in the novel. If you would prefer it, this book was also made into a movie and may be easier to understand, as watching it, made it clearer for me to understand. This book was violent and disturbing, but I would probably recommend this book to older teenagers, keeping in mind that it is graphic.
B000002L68|5.0|Every rock critic likes to talk bout the series of albums the rolling stones put out from the late 60's to early 70's as being their peek,  or  with Stevie Wonder and how all the albums he put out in the early 70's was his peek, but  no one really  points out that from the early to mid-80s Prince didnt do to bad for himself  with the release of 1999, Purple Rain, and Sign of The Times. Of Those I'd like to take a look at Purple Rain and to do so its worth remembering the early 80's, music was really going in a different direction, after the british invasion and the motown sound of the 60's,  the big arena rock, punk and disco of the 70s,   music in the 80s was going more pop, with the likes of micheal jackson and madonna and duran duran leading the charge,  even veterans like tina turner, david bowie and bruce springsteen were starting to find a new audience after tailoring their music for a more radio friendly crowd.  <br />And yet from all this Prince still managed to stand out for various reason,  the first being the reality that not since the death of hendrix, had a black man man been seen on stage playing loud rock guitar and playing it a hell of lot better then 90% of the van halen clones out there at the time.  But unlike hendrix  prince started out in a more androgyous route where u really werent sure if he really was gay or straight or if it was all just a really brillant media stunt. and since he played several different instruments but never stayed slave to one musical style , he could be soul, rock, funk, erotic dance music all at once  as if some one had cloned the DNA of jagger, bowie, hendrix, sly stone and little richard and made the total rock package.  <br />In 1984 that package was finally opened to the world with the release of Purple Rain which was a soundtrack to the film Prince stared in,   now with everyone from 50 cent to brittney spears trying act and put out a soundtrack, back in 1984  this was seen as big deal, especially for an artist who at the time people figured was just some weird guy with eyeliner who sung \\"little red corvette\\"  but prince pulled it off  and the truth is even if the film, which is great, never existed, this album still would had sold the truck load of copies it had just because the songs are all that good, like the saying goes \\"all killer, no filler\\". <br />A couple of these songs where actually recorded live for the album at a small club and just like at a good concert, prince sets the mood with \\"let's go crazy\\" which comes off more as just an antham for life,  that is u just have to go a lil crazy and just have fun or else life will wind up getting u down . <br />Next up is \\"take me with you\\" now if u have seen the movie, who can hear this song and not think of the scene of prince and apollonia riding on the motorcycle with the sun shinning down on those trees in the woods. and that what the song does for u it makes u want to just run away with someone and not look back.  <br />The album then shifts gears a bit with \\"the beautiful ones\\" some how the older this songs gets, the sadder it seems, simply its bout the longing to be loved  and course the ending of the song where prince just lets loose had opened him up to a few comedic parodies over the years, and yes it can sound over the top, but better to sound over the top at being sincere then to just look foolishly over the top.   <br />Its been said that hearing \\"Darling Nikki\\" was what spearheaded tipper gore to form the PMRC in the 80s. to me the worst offense of the song is that u can now never meet a girl named nikki without picturing her with a magazine <br />\\"Baby Im A Star\\"  is strictly a party song meant to get ur butt out of ur seat and move and that might had been why  it was one of the songs that prince and the revolution recorded live  because it needed that audience vibe to be complete like u were part of the party. <br />IF \\"Baby Im A Star\\" was the climax to a great party then the next song the afterglow, honestly when i was little i use to find the title track kinda slow and just couldnt get into it, to hear it now you could call it prince's own stairway to heaven, last year I got to see him play his greatest hits in concert and this was the song that ended the show and brought down the house, in fact, to hear it on album alone doesnt do it justice becuase if u havent heard price play the solo to \\"Purple Rain\\" live then ... u just havent lived because not only does prince show that he was the cloest anyone came to emulating hendrix on guitar, he shows what the guitar would sound like if u went one step higher then hendrix.  <br />the record sells may say that the biggest seller of the 80s was Thriller but for me   the real be all, end all of the 1980s music, for rock, funk, dance, and tender ballards will always be purple rain    BUY THE DAMM RECORD!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never saw this gem of a series until it hit the Sci-Fi network, discovering it there by a combination of advertising (something Fox never tried, apparently) and word-of-mouth. I've since become a fan and have turned several others on to the Firefly phenomena by giving this DVD set as a (well-received) gift. To enjoy Firefly, you don't have to love Sci-Fi, you just have to love Quality. <br /> <br />And if Serenity is indeed the end of the Firefly story (at least, filmed), then so be it, sadly. The many enigmas will forever remain a mystery, not the least of which is why a low-brow outfit like Fox Television ever green-lighted this short-lived masterpiece in the first place.
B00008LOS1|1.0|By now its easy to think that perhaps Pete Townsend should change the line in My Generation from \\"hope i die before i  get old \\" to simply \\"wont stop till we all drop (dead)\\". Since the band seems to have toured more since their early 80's farewell tour then they ever did during the height of the original line up from 1966-1978.  Just as it would be understandable if some 15 year old Greenday fan see one old guy singing very horsed and another old guy with most of his hair missing and maybe swinging his arm in a circle like he was trying to fly away, and wonder what the big deal is. <br />Now granted Im no baby boomer myself, in fact Keith Moon died just one year after I was born  but I can say I have spent the last 12 years now \\"getting in tune\\" so to say with the music of trully one of the greatest rock bands ever The Who, and I can say one album had to stand out as being the reason why they are still held in such high regard,  Who's Next would be it. <br /> <br />After the success of Tommy alot of people wonderedwhat direction the who was going in next,  they had already started out as a lil hard edged RnB band and quickly spent another 2 years giving the beatles and the stones a run in the great singles contest.  But Tommy proved once and for all that  Pete Townsend wasnt just a great songwriter/guitar player but that he was also the one guy who saw greater heights for rock then just good way to score with the ladies and in Daltry, Entwistle and Moon had the right bandmates to carry it off with. <br /> <br />The album starts off with Baba O'Riley and from the moment those synthesiser come in you know that both the who as well as rock music are going in a brand new direction, by now this song has surely been played to death on classic rock radio but go back to the music coming out in 1971,  nothing else sounded like this , townsend sounds more like he is trying the instrument like another guitar then like a regular keyboard,  the only other person at the time whocould come close to this at the time was stevie wonder, but even his music was still rooted in the funk/soul/church tradition,,  for a very \\"vanilla\\" rock group to do this at the time at to seem as normal as man walking on the moon for the first time.  <br />Next up is Bargain and it sounds like here pete is reling even more on the sythesiser as if to prove that this wasnt just some one trick novalty for him and that he was serious bout expanding the sound of rock. Bargain is also the first true Keith Moon dominated sound and with producer Glyn Jones, for the first time keith's drumming sounds as powerful and in ur face as anything john bonham could do for zepplin, listen to all the other who albums and then go back who's next and tell me this isnt the best album keith would do as the who's drummer. <br />Even though John Entwistle was one of the best bass players to come along, its really his songwriting that gets to shine here,  between keith's drumming and pete's guitar and keyboard work, its easy to miss some of the bass notes in the mix so its on John's My Wife where he gets to shine. for the most part Who's next is a very spritual album all bout the quest for some sort of salvation, john bring the whole thing down to earth in the story of a man who is just seeking survival from his spouse once she finds out he has been out all night . <br />but its Roger who gets to shine on the last two cuts , Behind Blue Eyes and Wont Get Fooled Again are two other songs that have been played into a coma thanks to radio and yet one reason why they can still sound fresh is the conviction in roger's voice whether its the voice of yearning to be understood  in the former or a declaration of intent in the latter its roger's voice that comes off like the eye in the center of the storm of the 3 musicians and of course that final scream he gives at the end of Wont Get Fooled would set the standard for countless, shirtless, bare chested blond frontmen everywhere, but the truth is there can only be one master shouter and after him no one is next.. <br />On this deluxe edition u get the who in concert , in their prime perfoming the songs on here at the young vic theater and its easy to see that they had no trouble accomdating pete's new sound to their on stage machine and it help keep them from just being known as the band that tore apart their instruments on stage. and considering who the band would sound in later years with keith's excesses affecting his playing and later a cast of thousands it seemed trying to help fill in the groups sound after he died, and finally seeing the who try to carry on with just pete and roger as the surviving members,  the live disk also is another reminder that in the early 70's when the who were at their peak, trully who else really could be any greater?

Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon) is suave and sophisticated and is never seen before sunset.  When some girls start missing, Charley starts to suspect that Jerry might be a vampire.  When he cannot convince anyone else of this, he goes to Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowell).  Peter, at first, is skeptical, like the rest.  But eventually Charley brings him around. <br /> <br />Charley, Amy and Vincent go against Dandridge.  Of course, you know how it has to end.  This film combines comedy with horror to make a fine hybrid.  Roddy McDowell was a great character actor in early days of MGM (best as Liz Taylor's sidekick.)

B0007Y08IS|3.0|In my opinion, this is one of the most hilarious movies ever made. The entire theater was full of laughter throughout the movie. I am one of those people who love the minds of South Park, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, who you can tell the voiceovers are the same in the movie as the show if you listen carefully.  <br />       My only complaint is with the DVD. I am part of the 95% of America that does not own a widescreen tv. So, considering the unrated version comes ONLY in widescreen, I had to live with the extra-wide bars, bars that even appear on widescreen tvs. I chose to live with that due to the unrated appeal. However, I was dissatisfied with my choice, as the unrated version is minutely different from the theater, full screen version. It only extends the controversial puppet \\"love\\" scene in a comedically gross way. THATS IT <br />      So, if you are like me, stuck with a regular tv, get the full screen version. It has all the same special features, same GREAT movie, and you wont have to live with those huge black bars on the screen.

The film starts to fall apart about half way through but when it gets to the end here, it is just a joke. <br /> <br />Cruise's character is atypical of a Cruise character.  He gives a very good performance until the end when not even Tom can over come the mess. <br /> <br />Jamie Foxx is given a serious character and for the first half of the film Foxx is amazing but about half way through he pulls out his safe standard Jamie Foxx character.  And by the end he is just bouncing off the walls and chewing all the scenery. <br /> <br />This should have been a study of the two characters but had to become an obligatory action no brain film. <br /> <br />Don't waste your money on this.  If you must, rent it or better yet wait for it to hit cable.
0393312836|3.0|A CLOCKWORK ORANGE  <br /> In Anthony Burgess's, A Clockwork Orange,  his depiction of the future teenage culture is a disturbing one. It is a compelling story about the importance of free thinking. The main character, Alex a fifteen year old boy leads a group of three other \\"droogs,\\" Pete, Georgie, and poor old Dim. The four boys antagonize citizens for amusement, roaming the streets, engaging in gang violence, robbery, beating up men, and raping women. Justice seemed like a thing of the past until one night it caught up with Alex when he and his droogs stole a car and cruised the streets looking for trouble wherever they could find it.  The others, were inspired to turn their backs to their leader. The next time they go out, they break into an old woman's house, and she calls the police as the boys are trying to flee the scene Dim hits Alex in the face was deserted and left for the police. The police then inform Alex that the women he beat and raped in an earlier robbery has passed. Alex is sentenced to fourteen years in prison for her death. After fighting with and killing his cellmate he is chosen for an experimental treatment called Ludovico's Technique. The doctors inject him with a drug that makes him experience nausea and headaches, while making him watch violent movies and listen to classical music. After two weeks of this brainwashing torment the mere thought of violence is enough to make Alex ill and is released from prison. A twisted hand of fate leads him to a cottage for help, and he recognizes the man whose wife he had raped. After talking with Alex he begins to recognize the slang nadsat, that the teenagers who broke into his house and raped his wife used, which arouses his suspicion. He changes, his mind and locks Alex in an apartment and blare classical music, hoping to drive him to his suicide. He throws himself out the window, but only to wake up at a hospital, shortly after the old violent Alex is restored. The only thing that defines individuality is our differences, whether they be good or bad ones, it's wrong to try to correct people's faults. Humans are far from perfect, and brainwashing them to fit the mold, stripping them of their individuality is sinful.  The book is narrated in teen slang called nadsat, which incorporates elements of  Cockney English and Russian. I would suggest that you search for a glossary online in order to develop a better understand of the text. I would highly recommend reading this book, because it offers insight into the mind of a violent thinker.
B000059TEP|5.0|Ghost is a great supernatural thriller with a humorous edge.  Sam Wheat and Molly Jensen (Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore) have decided to live together.  He is an investment banker and she is a sculptress.  Paul (Tony Goldwyn) works with Sam.

Eventually, Sam finds out the whole truth. But the man behind the killing is getting desperate and he needs to get rid of the last witness, Molly. <br /> <br />Jerry Zucker was most famous for Airplane and other spoofs he created with his brother.  No one expected this level of sophistication in his direction.  It starts out as a romance, then becomes a supernatural movie with comedic elements and ends up a mystery, which it was the whole time.  Each handled with precision. <br /> <br />PatrickSwayze had a series of hits but all the films would be considered light weight.  This was his first acting triumph.  Demi Moore was known for good performances in B Films.  This was her first great performance in an A Film.  Whoopi Goldberg took show business by storm.  Mike Nichols discovered her on woman show and brought it to Broadway.  This started her meteoric rise.  Next Spielberg cast her in the lead of The Color Purple and Whoopi received a Best Actress Oscar Nomination.  Since then, she was a star but never found another defining role.  That is until Ghost.  She takes Oda Mae Brown to a level even the writer and director did not expect.  Her ability to go from high drama to slapstick without it looking unreal was perfection.  I knew when I saw the film that this was her Oscar performance, and it was. <br /> <br />Ghost has something for everyone in it. <br /> <br />DVD EXTRAS: Documentary - Remembering the Magic - A look back on creation of this film.  It is very interesting with great insights about the film and the makers.  <br />
B00005JOIF|3.0|Munich is almost boring.  This movie drags and is far too long.  Steven Spielberg allowed his left wing ideology get in the way of the story.  He seemingly wanted to make sure that we left the theater believing that both sides are equally guilty in the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelis.  Radical leftist Tony Kushner, who believes that Israel should have never came into existence, wrote the screen play.  Both gentlemen obviously perceive the Palestinians as alleged victims of Israeli imperialism.  The murders which took place during the Olympic games in 1972 are therefore somewhat understandable.<br /><br />The very first thing you must remember about Munich is that it is not even remotely true.  Israel did indeed send assassins to kill the Palestinians responsible for the massacre---but they were not existentially guilt tripped.  None of those who actually participated in this pursuit of justified vengeance resemble the fictional Avner (Eric Bana) and his group of misfits.  We follow the latter throughout Europe and Beirut as they one by one assassinate those on the hit list provided by the Mossad.  There is one peculiar scene when the Israelis and a group of Palestinians spend the night together.  They do not sing Kumbaya.  Still, their interactions supposedly suggest that the world would be a wonderful place if only we learned to communicate better with each other.  Terrorists only need a little love and understanding.  Moreover,  employing violent methods to eradicate terrorism will make things far worse.  The cycle of violence must stop.  Nothing, of course, could be further from the truth.  Violence often accomplishes some wonderful things.  If nothing else, it's how we ended WW II.  Also, please note that regular police officers do not stop arresting criminals merely because crime does not totally disappear.  Is Munich a pacifist film?  No, it's far worse than that: it is an indulgence in nihilism.
B000AGTPUU|3.0|The entertainment factor was good, mainly due to the animation and graphics, but I was disappointed with the story line, particularly because of it's treatment of the idea of belief. The basic moral of the story is that if you believe in something you're doing good. The difficulty I have with that is it's not necessarily true (terrorists believe in \\"something\\"). There's alot of talk in the movie about belief, and implications of faith, but at the same time it takes particular precautions to stay on the politically correct side of the Christmas fence. Nothing about the birth of Jesus is mentioned, and even the selection of Christmas tunes avoid any connection to the birth of Christ (e.g. Santa Claus in Coming to Town, O'Christmas Tree, Chestnuts Roasting on a Open Fire, etc.). I will grant that part of the American Holiday called \\"Christmas\\" includes a mythical character called Santa Claus, but it's also about a real person called Jesus Christ, and many more Americans believe that, than a minority of Americans would like to believe. There is nothing magical about the idea of Santa Claus, as the movie suggests. The Santa Claus part of Christmas is connected to lights, and decorations, and Christmas trees, and shopping, and commercialism, and getting gifts, and ultimately promotes greed and stress. The Jesus Christ part of Christmas, and the whole story surrounding that, is the source of Christmas charity and giving, and ultimately promotes goodwill toward others, and faith in something that can really make a difference in a person's life. The Jesus Christ part of Christmas contains all the things that Americans truely value most, whether they \\"believe\\" in Jesus Christ of not.
0446577383|3.0|I've been reading Baldacci for quite some times and really liked his writing until this novel. <br /> <br />I think this novel is a miss rather than a hit. Baldacci's writing is below his usual level, and there is just to much political crap in this book. <br /> <br />All the conversations in the cabinet after the arab's act just seemed to me out of character. All of a sudden you have the secretary of state throwing obvious facts that are known to everyone in the cabinet, and are only for the readers. <br /> <br />The plot itself is satisfying but in the end, you get the feeling Baldacci only used this novel to criticize the american invasion to iraq: the arabs plot because of the invasion to iraq, the hot-headed new president jumps to nuclear weapons in nano-time. <br /> <br />Also, I did get the feeling in the beginning he was going for the same type of storyline he used in Absolute Power (where a thief sees a murder by the secret service), but he spun it in a different direction. <br /> <br />This is not why I like to read Baldacci. Could have been much better. All in all, a disapointment.
B00009ZYBY|5.0|I just took the time to see this movie, and now I finally understand the excitement. After renting, I bought the DVD. The DVD is excellent, both picture and sound, and it has good extras and interviews, including one with Crowe, one on the computer graphics, and one on the music.<br /><br />It is not your usual Hollywood movie and Crowe is simply outstanding - perhaps a modern day Bogart. In some ways it is like the old epic movies, and the movie is a good combination of writing, cinematography, acting, plus the magnet personality of Crowe. It is like an old fashion Hollywood Roman movie with the chariot scenes, but then again it has a much more complicated an unpredictable plot plus it mixes in a bit of the surreal. Simply a great movie that<br /><br />I had to watch twice in a row on the first viewing. The only negative for some people will be the bloody fight scenes - but they add to our understanding of the dangers and the lives of the Roman troops and the gladiators.<br /><br />It is that good and easy to understand the excitement and the awards.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|I was never a \\"Sex and The City\\" Fan. I had heard about the show, but nothing else. I didn't even think about watching it, when for my birthday someone gave me all of the seasons, and i started watching them. For my suprise, it was and it still is,  the best TV show that I had ever seen. Funny, dramatic, depressing, and everything else you could think off.  <br /> <br />As soon as I heard that this Collector's edition was coming out, I could not wait to get it. I understand it is probably not fair for this Collector's Edition to come out now, and at an incredible price, but believe me, it is WORTH IT. <br /> <br />The Bonus Features keep you laughing, and teach you more things about the show, and the package itself is just wonderful: Pictures everywhere, quotes, summaries.... I just can't get enough of it. If you really want to get this Collector's Edition of \\"Sex and The City\\" just sell the ones you have at a cheaper price (I know someone would buy them) and then just put some extra money and get it. You would love it as much as i did......and still do.
B000001EGE|5.0|Honkey Cat is classic right off the bat, very catchy memorable tune, great upbeat fun. Sooo I give this good opener an 8 for great. 8/10.<br /><br />Mellow is another good song, also nice and upbeat, funny, since its called Mellow, its not very mellow, but still a nice song. 8.5/10.<br /><br />And now, a very fun and yet dark song about suicidal Sir Elton, during the time of the song, interesting how cheery it sounds, but, I Think I'm Gonna Kill Myself, doesnt sound to cheery, but great song, a missed song on the recent greatest hits. 9.5/10.<br /><br />Susie is a worthy upbeat Elton song. Not classic, but you can still hear the heart put into it. 8/10.<br /><br />Rocket Man. Umm. You should already know. 10/10. Great lyrics and music. Classic!<br /><br />Salvation is good, better then I remember it being. 8.5/10.<br /><br />Slave is pretty good, probably the weakest song on the album though. 7.5/10.<br /><br />Amy, really good, could have been a classic. Nice and upbeat, like the ending. 9/10. Oh and I too never been kissed by a girl named Amy.<br /><br />Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters. This should have been his most classic, but for some reason wasn't. Very beautiful and moving song. A Elton John must! 10/10!!<br /><br />Hercules, good ending, about a cat, EJ! Great album well done! 8/10<br /><br />Oh yeah the alternate version of Slave. Good enough, but I usually stop it after Hercules.<br /><br />Yet another worthy Elton John album for your collection.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|first of all i don't know why so many  bash reloaded i love that movie and it not only exceeded the first movie it surpassed any expectation i had about the sequal to the best sci fi movie ever. that being said the 3rd movie  was a major disapointment they just dropped most of the story they bulit up in two and instead took the easy way out and did not explain some of the tuffer questions. but that being said this movie as a stand alone without considering the other 2 is a excellent story great special effects and wonderful cast. but i was very disapointed in the ending of this movie and how they chose to end things unless some one desides as they did with star wars to continue the story with novels it will be the greatest let down and greatest blown chance a movie or books ever had of making some serious cash. however i do recomend revolutions although it is impossible to view this movie as a stand alone or you will not know what is going on.
B00005JKG9|5.0|Glengarry Glen Ross is a brilliant examination of the American dream gone south.  This is an examination of power and desperation.   <br /> <br />Premiere Properties sell investment land.  Rio Rancho is the current project.  The sales leads for the project are pretty well worn.  The new project is Glengarry Glen Ross with brand new sales leads. <br /> <br />Just like the leads, the sales force is either well worn or hot.  The sales force reeks with desperation.  The sales force includes Shelley Levene (Jack Lemmon), Dave Moss (Ed Harris) and George Aaronow (Alan Arkin), James Lingk (Jonathan Pryce) all on the Rio Rancho downslide and Ricky Romano (Al Pacino), the only one on a hot streak.  Their boss is John Williamson (Kevin Spacey).  John lives and dies by his sales force.  The main office wants Rio Rancho sold out before starting on Glengarry Glen Ross.  They send division head Blake (Alec Baldwin) to incentivize the office. <br /> <br />This only leads to more desperation in the sales staff.  Then, the office is robbed of the Glengarry Glen Ross leads.  The police are called in and all the staff is questioned.  Eventually, the thief admits to the crime. <br /> <br />David Mamet is considered on of the great playwrights of the 80's and 90's.  What he is noted for is the exactness of his words.  This makes it very difficult for actors.  Casting is imperative.  Its not the quality of actors, its just their type.  In this case every actor is perfection. <br /> <br />This was one of Jack Lemmon's last films and was his one of his best performances. <br /> <br />DVD EXTRAS:  <br /> <br />Disc 1: <br />Magic Time: A Tribute to Jack Lemmon - A wonderful 30 minute tribute to Jack Lemmon from his son Chris Lemmon, actor Peter Gallagher (Long Day's Journey Into Night), and directors Jon Avildsen (Save the Tiger) and James Foley (Glengarry Glen Ross).  It ends with his appearance on Inside the Actor's Studio and shows why he was so beloved by all who saw him. <br /> <br />Commentary by film director James Foley <br /> <br />Disc 2: <br />ABC: Always Be Closing - A 30 minute documentary interviewing real estate salesmen and getting their impression on the film.  <br /> <br />J.

B00006EXL5|4.0|Like many MCR fans, I discovered Bullets after listening to Three Cheers. My first impression of Bullets, I will admit, was definitly one of disgust. I didn't like this CD at all because it was really different from three cheers.  However, this CD grows on you after a while. Soon I was listening to it all the time. <br />The difference between the two albums is pretty startling at first. None of the songs on Bullets have quite the same polished feel as say, Helena and I'm not okay. <br /> <br />To my delight, however, Bullets does not have that pop-ish quality to it that Three Cheers has. The songs are darker and moodier.  <br />Once you get used to the differences, Bullets is definitly just as good if not better than Three Cheers. Some of the best songs on this CD are, drowning lessons, headfirst for halos, vampires will never hurt you and honey this mirror aint big enough for the two of us.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|This is a perfect remake. Not one iota of new matter. It is the same as the old film but remade with modern techniques. We delve into a prehistoric world with all the fauna and flora. The fauna is more important though. All the dinosaurs, and giant bugs, and giant worms, and giant bats, etc. Creepy crawling all over the place. We do not see the zipper in the back of the monster and he is lovable, especially his eyes. It is the meeting of the Belle and the Beast who is the Beau of the Belle and he gives way just before she is completely destroyed. The Beast, who is a gallant Beau, is thus undone by the Belle. No anthropology and the natives are just enhancing the pictures, the settings and the environment, a few dancers around the beast on some sound-stage. Yet the film is great because visually it is a treat, a highstyle and highpleasure treat. All the scenes, the creatures, the landscapes, mountainscapes, seascapes, urbanscapes are superb and the droning planes at the end are just as funny, strange and fascinating as the droning giant mosquitoes or wasps in the middle. It is brilliant and the eyes of the Beast are so human that we understand why the Belle fell in love with him, because he becomes a him at that moment, at the moment of his death, a wilfull death. Apart from that don't look for any real deep meaning, not even on the 1930s in the US. The Salvation Army is not the subject of the tale. Just enjoy the luxuriance of the special effects.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Universit&eacute; Paris Dauphine, Universit&eacute; Paris I Panth&eacute;on Sorbonne
B000BOH8XW|4.0|Shakira is one of those wonderful artists who isn't afraid to make an album with many styles thrown into the mix.  Saying that, there is undeniably that Shakira 'sound' prevalent throughout the album.  Vol 1 was a stunning (and long overdue) follow up to Laundry Service, and she wrote so many songs during that recording session, that she split them into 2, the Spanish language Vol 1, and this, the English Vol 2. <br />2 of the tracks are English versions of a couple of the best tracks taken from vol 1, 'The Day and Time'( Dia especial)   and 'Something'-(En tu pupilas') and the rest, a stunning mix of styles (though cleverly never abandoning her musical heritage), Mexican trumpets, Church Male vocal choirs opening the cd on 'How Do You Know', Carlos Santana provides guitar on 'Illegal', and even children supplying backing vocals on the African sounding 'Timor' which brilliantly closes the album.  This is a fantastic, upbeat album, which proves Shakiras undoubtably the worlds greatest Spanish language artist.   <br />I've marked it a 4 simply because there were a couple of other songs on Vol 1 I would liked to have had translated and I feel that Vol 1 had even stronger material.
B00005NWYT|5.0|\\"I'd rather be blue thinking of you<br />I'd rather be blue over you<br />Than be happy with somebody else...\\"<br /><br />I've always thought Barbra to be one of the most beautiful women in the world and in this movie she also radiates a stunning internal fire that I am sure still takes men's breath away. She is not only comical, cute and courageous; she displays so many qualities men love all while playing a somewhat innocent role next to the more worldly wise Nick Arnstein. The comedic elements are laugh out loud funny and the romantic scenes dramatic and heart elating or tear inducing.<br /><br />Together they are polar opposites drawn to each other by their differences all while recognizing the similarities in their life purpose goals. While Fanny Brice falls into luck, Nick Arnstein (Omar Sharif) meets her when he is at his zenith. His love for her almost seems to make his wildly adventurous life seem less attractive and as he commits himself to his marriage, he starts to lose his Poker face. As he makes his money playing Poker, Fanny continues on her rise to the stars. Her stardom soon starts to make Nick feel insignificant and no matter what she tries to accomplish, all her plans for his success are thwarted by his pride.<br /><br />Part of the movie was filmed at the Jersey Central Railway Station and in the special features they show a very small portion of the filming. However, the theatre settings, country homes and train station bring rare beauty and details that only serve to enhance the romance.<br /><br />The vulnerability while singing \\"I'd Rather be Blue\\" is a rare scene with Streisand on lime green roller skates and purple stockings in front of dusty red curtains framing a scene of an Italian garden complete with cypress trees. And who could not love her in the Bride Scenes, which are spectacular in all their sparkling beauty and classy choreographed style. She is most beautiful in her sparkly blue outfit laughing on the red couch in front of ruby wallpapered walls as Omar sings: \\"You are woman, I am man, let's kiss.\\" What decorating, what a dress! What a look on her face after being kissed. Barbra must have a thousand different facial expressions in this movie and they are all priceless.<br /><br />The Special Features include:<br /><br />Barbra in Movieland<br />This is Streisand<br />Song Highlights<br />Filmographies<br />Bonus Trailers<br /><br />I didn't think I could love a movie more than My Fair Lady or Doctor Zhivago or Gone with the Wind, but Funny Girl is romantic, musical and the costumes and settings are spectacular. Trains, true love and Barbra's gorgeous voice makes Funny Girl a dream. As a romantic comedy this is a true classic for any collector. This movie truly stole my heart as it is one of the rare moments in time where women were allowed to be vulnerable and strong within a classic portrayal of the ideal romance. Such longing...<br /><br />Traditional ideas about beauty have always been overrated. In reality, the people we want to be around have a great personality and a sense of humor. As one of my boyfriends from my teenage years once told me: \\"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.\\" To me, Barbra is stunning and brings out all the elements of feminine beauty and mystique most actors today can't touch.<br /><br />Just when you think the movie is going to end, there is an intermission. Thankfully! Like many of my favorite movies, I didn't want this one to end. When it does end, you may feel compelled to watch it again and again. I'm almost happy I waited over 35 years to see this movie (Well, it was made the year after I was born and \\"People who Love People\\" is part of the soundtrack of my life. Finally I understand the movie connection.) and the DVD transfer is beyond perfect.<br /><br />In \\"True Love,\\" I fear we would all rather be blue than happy with somebody else. Isn't life funny that way? ;) No matter your political opinion, this is a movie you can escape into with complete abandon. In the end, the way the game of love works may be the most intriguing part of analyzing Funny Girl.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review<br />Hopeless Romantic, don't try to save me!Girl.    ~The Rebecca Review  Hopeless Romantic, don't try to save me!
B0009HKH6Q|5.0|This film very well could have been a case of style over substance.  But what style!  The cars are cool, the clothes are cool(particularly Faye Dunaway's mini-dresses), the interiors are cool.  Even the use of multi-screen images, which were fashionable in some circles in sixties but I find annoying, is used to good effect.  Understatement is the rule of thumb here and Norman Jewison directs this caper film effectively in that manner.  Steve McQueen never got the respect as an actor he deserved probably because he wasn't the most histrionic of actors.  Here he plays his emotions fairly tight to the vest which befits Thomas Crown.  McQueen is more than matched by Dunaway who plays an insurance investigator whose success in her field relies on her feminine wiles in tandom with her brains.  The sparks that eminate between McQueen and Dunaway are combustible and rare in a film.  The literal chess match between the two is more sensual than 100 films featuring couples making love.
B00023B1Y4|5.0|A very fine, extremely well-made and highly intelligent movie. Superior to any American war movie I can think of, and more honest, with the possible exception of All Quiet on the Western Front (that is an American movie, isn't it?). I won't mention some of the other recent blockbusting trash that has been gathering honours and raking in dollars from the blinkered masses. It is certainly exciting and action-packed, but also depressing, as other reviewers have pointed out. Anyone who thinks twice about the manner in which the incidents unfold can only shake his/her head. The mission was successful, but accomplished nothing. A botched, half-baked plan resulted in 16 hours of killing and confusion, after which 18 brave but naive young American soldiers were dead, along with 1000 Somalis. In \\"The Fog of War\\" Robert McNamara said one of the lessons he had learned was to \\"know your enemy\\". When will America learn this lesson?  One of the things I learned as an officer in the Army (the British Army, of course) is that time spent on reconnaissance is never, never wasted. If the American Army really tackles its missions in the way they are presented on film, then I am extremely unimpressed. We are constantly being shown a group of young men being chucked gung-ho into situations for which they are very poorly prepared, with the senior command simply relying on guts and superior fire-power. Rambo wins through, usually single-handed. Unfortunately, real war is not a game of football, or merely zapping space invaders with hi-tech weaponry. This is a completely non-racist movie, unlike the goofy rubbish it is being compared with, which isn't mentioned above.
0783231032|3.0|This is the kind of movie for mild Sunday afternoon TV entertainment.  The comedy is nothing spectacular, but the scenery is something to be appreciated.<br /><br />But, what I really don't like about this film, is how everything looks so foggy.  All smokey and greyed out.  Maybe it was Speilberg's intention to have the California coastline always appear to be in the fog. And so, the one thing that comes with a foggy greyed-out scenery, on the TV screen, is that it appears to be grainy.  So the overall movie is just uninteresting.<br /><br />Embarrassingly unfunny (which is a shame because of its wonderful cast of classic comic actors), the movie goes on way too long for such a mediocre story, and the picture quality is very unappealing to the eye.  What a disaster for what should have been a fabulous concept film.<br /><br />I see that it has been re-issued.  Does anyone have the newer release, and does it look any better?  George Lucas was able to change some things on the original \\"Star Wars\\" Trilogy.  Do you think that Speilberg could remove all that fog and make \\"1941\\" more colorful?  Or is it understood that this film's re-sale potential just may not be worth the effort?<br /><br />I would hope that Speilberg would consider doing this while making this one of the first new remastered releases for movies being made into a \\"High Definition\\" transfer, since basically, up to this point, very few DVD's are as of yet?<br /><br />When you get a HD TV and the new HD DVD player that will be all the rage this new year (2006), you will soon be replacing your favorite DVD's with new re-issued High Definition Transferred DVD's yet to come, following this new DVD technology.<br /><br />A better TV (or even a High Definition TV) is not going to make your DVD's look any better.  Most of your DVD's weren't made for High Definition.  So don't rely on that misconception.<br /><br />Maybe, this film wouldn't sell well alone on Blu-Ray (I'd buy it though), but perhaps it could be sold in a 3-fer like \\"Animal House, 1941, and The Blues Brothers.\\" A great triple feature.  What do you think?sold in a 3-fer like \\"Animal House, 1941, and The Blues Brothers.\\" A great triple feature.  What do you think?

1401308201|5.0|I just recently saw the smash-hit musical Wicked and was completely blown away by the way this broadway musical was performed and the intricate set and costume design. Which is why I am reccomending this book to any fan of Wicked (and to those who have yet to see the show). The outside cover is the first thing you see. It captures the eye in intricate lines and the aged, worn look on the spine and corners. But what really makes the book complete (obviously) is the contents within the cover. The Grimmerie includes many in depth, historical facts about Gregory Maguire and the actual book, Wicked. The book even includes a handwritten copy of the first few pages of the amazing novel. Even the inside pictures and pages looked worn. It's 191 pages consume the reader with notes, interviews, a partial libretto, and captivating behind-the-scenes photos. This book also includes costume and set sketches which are set next to the actual on-set design pictures. In the back, there is even a glossary if you don't quite understand all the Galinda-isms. Basically if you loved the musical, this is the perfect book for you. Definitely worth the money with all the color pictures and revealed secrets. I hope you all enjoy this book!
B0007TKNIS|3.0|While I am a huge fan of the musical I was rather disappointed with the film. The good: <br /> <br />-Amazing costume and set design <br />-Miranda Richardson as Madame Giry is fantastic, she has the most genuine emotion out of all the characters <br />-Gerard Butler: His vocal delivery is defferent then Michael Crawford's but still is full of the emotion that is generally lacking in the movie. The error in character is the fault of the filmaker, the Phantom comes off as pathetic, not dangerous. <br />-Minnie Driver is hilarious as Carlotta, regardless of whether or not her voice is dubbed <br /> <br />And now the bad: <br /> <br />-Patrick Wilson: Although he may have a beautiful voice, I did not believe a single word. His delivery is stiff and hollow, a beautiful voice is not enough to carry the character. <br />-Emmy Rossum: While she does have a gorgeous soprano voice, it is quiet and breathy and does not seem to fit the part. Listen to Sarah Brightman's voice on the original soundtrack to hear the difference. I just wish her voice was stronger. And why the same facial expression the entire movie? <br />-Some added scenes, they don't really contribute <br />-Spoken lyrics...NO...never again...please, they don't sound like dialougue they sound like badly acted lines and it isn't fair to the actors. <br /> <br />I would recommend the film to anyone who is a fan or thouroghly appreciates musicals, otherwise I'd steer clear and go see it on stage.
B000000OU4|4.0|Most of what I like by Pat Metheny was released in the 70's and 80's.  To me this was his best CD made in the 90's.  Some of his songs are just too long, and go nowhere.  That's not the case with this CD. Almost all of the songs are good and the production is superb!!!  This is a good CD with lot's of variety!!!
B000AP04FG|3.0|The movie is framed by marriage counseling sessions.  The first session at the start of the film introduces the characters John Smith (Brad Pitt) and Jane Smith (Angelina Jolie) who are facing difficulties in their marriage of 5 years (John) or 6 years (Jane).  And we have a flash back to their first meeting, whirlwind romance, and marriage. One of the big draws is that each has a career that requires frequent and unexpected travel; he's a construction engineer and she's a computer consultant.  However, as we soon learn, they are actually highly skilled assassins. <br /> <br />Then they are each assigned the same target, foul the other up, and are expected to take out the assassin that foiled the hit. Then they discover the other assassin was their spouse. Then begins the misunderstandings, distrust, and havoc. There's lots of one liner quips, explosions, and neat action sequences. Eventually, as the realization that they really do love each other overcomes their trained suspicions, they begin to work together and you can see them go from not understanding the hand signals, beaming each other with equipment to smooth handoffs of ammunition cartridges and working as a team. The movie ends with another marriage counselor sequence where they are happily finding their marriage works. <br /> <br />It's not deep, but it's fun and full of excitement. There some interesting little things as they come from working against each other to working as a team.  Light entertainment.
B00004SZWB|4.0|It's hard to find a Stevie Wonder CD where almost every song is good. I own several of them and am a huge fan.  My favorites on this CD are Rocket Love, All I Do, and Lately.  The only song that I don't like is Happy Birthday. Buy it and you won't be sorry...I personally feel that it is one of his best!!!
B000BNX3B4|4.0|Must Love Dogs finds two recently divorced people (Sarah Nolan (Diane Lane), Jake Anderson (John Cusack)) being urged by friends and family to get in there and date. Mostly the story is about Sarah. Her sister puts her profile up on an Internet dating site and she meets a lot of men who just aren't her type to put it mildly. Then she meets Jake.  The first date is a bit tense as he insults her while trying to get to know her. The second doesn't go much better, and then she meets the father of one of her pupils. <br /> <br />Jake and Sarah just can't seem to click even though they like each other. There are misunderstandings, embarrassing situations, and lots of moments that most of us have endured in the dating game. And of course a happy ending. <br /> <br />Formulaic maybe. Fun -- definitely. Not high drama but well worth the time to watch and filled with those embarrassing moments that make you wince and yell at the tube \\"Don't go there\\", \\"No\\", and \\"Go for it.\\" <br /> <br />If you're a sucker for happy endings for good people, and enjoy seeing family members who care about each other, then this is just a nice feel good movie. Enjoy it for what it is.
B000002VJH|3.0|This still remains of the Grateful Dead's best studio recordings.  I know that they are the kind of band that are best appreciated live.  I saw them live one time and it was after they had released this album.  Maybe, that's why after all these years it is still among my favorite Dead CD's.  The best songs are Help On The Way/Slip Knot!, Franklin's Tower, The Music Never Stopped, and Crazy Fingers.  Only a true \\"Dead Head\\" will probably appreciate this CD...but, then again they probably already own it!!!
B0007GAERG|1.0|<br />When I first listned to Ms Karey, her singing reminded me of the high ptched cocophany of sounder in must. Her bellowing reminded me of the low rumblings of oxen running to the bloody slaughterhouse. Her enlighted lyrics evoked the tenderness of frail porpoises rubbing agaist excited strong dolphins. Her pear physique in her music videos reminded me of a hungry eager beaver swallowing twigs. (A beaver often  needs thick long branches and not twigs to feed appetite.)  <br /> <br />It's not every day that a talented artist can slaughter Elvis's records: the most number 1's; the most weeks at number 1; the most top ten hits; the most albums sold for men and women (her album sales crush Michelle/Janet Jacksons' sales); highest concert attendance; the most critical acclaim; the most oscars, tonys, and grammy's; and the most fans. Thank you for reading this. I hope this helps you buy this record and not Madonna's or Usher's latest releases. Thank you. <br /> <br />My favorite songs are numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Happy Holidays everyone. Thank you again everybody.  <br /> <br />
0441172717|5.0|I'm going to make this short and sweet (At least in comparison to most of the reviews I've already read for this book).  It's a great book.  It has depth.  It has cool characters.  It has all sorts of amazing subplots.  It's amazing.  I can't say enough good things about it.  It's a very intelecual book, hence everyone thinks they've graduated colege when having finished this book and think they have to write a big thesis.  It's a BOOK for crying out loud.  It's amazing but you don't have to write a billion paragraphs to state an opinion, people!
B00005JOIF|4.0|After the average SFX thriller, War of the Worlds, Munich is another notch in Steven Spielberg's impressive career. The acting is great all around, especially Eric Bana in a break out role, and the direction is top of the line. The pacing was a little slower than expected and it did drag at times (hence the 4 stars), but overall Munich was an important movie that shows the pros and cons of revenge. I would wait for DVD, but if you have already seen everything out there (like me), this one is worth catching if you got the 3 hours to spare.
B000B8QF14|4.0|Okay I want to enforce the fact that I think this DVD is pretty damn cool. I love how it starts with American Idiot and ends in Good Riddance, but I think the band should have done the whole American Idiot album and stayed away from the old-school stuff. She's A Rebel, Give Me Novocaine and in particular Homecoming, among others, aren't played and it's because of this that Bullet In A Bible loses one star. But besides the lack of songs off their latest album, the concert and DVD is great. The crowd participation is brilliant, and the show that Billie Joe, Mike and Tre put on, blew me away. Awesome stuff.
1400032717|5.0|Author Mark Haddon did a brilliantly clever job in writing this book. It was very original, easy to read, and entertaining at all levels.  There is something in this book for anyone at any age over 15.  It strikes every emotion from laughter to sadness to anger to wonder.  Haddon took a very simple story, told through a very simple character and created something so profound and complex. You will also gain insight into the mind of someone with autism.  This insight will fill you with compassion for both the autistic child and their families who face enormous challenges.
B000AA305M|1.0|The album was great but the copy-protect scheme sucks bigtime!!!  I always rip backups of my CDs because my kids are hard on them.  Now my PC is running pig slow even though I refused the DRM agreement.  Come to find out even though I refused the DRM I had software installed on my system.  Is this the reason for the slowdown - who knows?  Shouldn't treat you legit customers this way.  No more Sony copy-protected CDs for me.  This scheme smears the good name of the artist as well as Amazon's
B000007R1M|5.0|To this day \\"Man Machine\\" is still my favorite Kraftwerk album, although \\"Computer World\\" runs a close 2nd. For some reason the sound of \\"Man Machine\\" takes me back to the late '70s (a time period on which I'm oddly fixated) like no other recording I own. I think the reason runs deeper than just nostalgia, I think Kraftwerk  really captured the \\"spirit of the time\\" with this one, while still riding the cutting edge. Regardless, it would be a shame if this music were forgotten - Give It a Try!
B000AM4PBS|5.0|I got this as a Christmas present last year, and let me just say I was blown away! It is the best present to recieve from [a special] someone. it comes in a beautiful wooden box, with a plastic cabinet-type door opener..just beautiful! I Love it!
0679422714|5.0|This book, along with 'Stalin : The Court of the Red Tsar' by Simon Sebag Montefiore, should be required reading for all who still hold a fanciful view of collectivism.  The amount of referenced information given in this book is astounding, considering the closed society in which Mao ruled, and to a large extent still exists in China.  Calling this a \\"hit piece\\" on Mao is just silly. A man who is responsible for more deaths that Hitler, Stalin and Pol Pot combined couldn't possibly be \\"hit\\" hard enough. <br />This book does a tremendous job of revealing Mao.  Although it took me a week to read, it only became more absorbing each time I picked it up.  Well written, extensively researched, and a very important book.
B000BTJDGC|2.0|I just got the DVD and I watched it...thought maybe something close to \\" the exorcist\\" .<br /><br /> BUT is about court room drama..Some few flash back to what's happened ,nothing special about it! This is  \\"NOT\\" horror movie AT ALL!!! Such as most people think that or I did so too. Is like drama courtroom. Have some suspense to it, that's all...acting was pretty good..But movie wasn't that much movie u want to see and excepted to be one.. SKIP this movie and don't waste your money and time like I did for nothing! Just boring court drama crap!! B
0307276902|4.0|man this was very disturbing, but very real i enjoyed it
0553801503|2.0|I am really afraid of the next book. A Feast for Crows was really slow and disappointing . It got bogged down in minor detail while glossing over the more interesting aspects of the story (The Mountain, The Hound) nonwithstanding George's statement that he focused on some characters more than others on purpose. I think he made a mistake. The beauty of the series so far was the fact that we saw the events played out through several points of view at the time - that is the whole crux of the Song Of Ice and Fire. All that changed with A Feast For Crows. I am very nervous that the series will descend into a tragical, neverending farce that Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time has become. I woved not to read any more of Robert Jordan's dross beyond Crossroads of Twilight. I am worried that I may have to make the same decision about George RR Martin after this book. I hope that the next book brings us more of what got all of us hooked on his work in the first place.
B000BM6AVA|1.0|Being a long-time fan of the band and after thoroughly enjoying 'Mezmerize', I was excited to know that I was going to get another System Of A Down serving before the end of the year.  Then that fateful day came and 'Hypnotize' was released.<br /><br />'Hypnotize' is horrible.  Yes, from front to back and beginning to end is terrible.  The lyrics are laughable(\\"The most lonliest day of my life\\" anyone?), the music is all over the place, and Serj might as well not even be a member of the band.  Now, I know a big complaint on this album is Daron taking over some of the vocal duty.  On 'Mezmerize' I was at first a bit annoyed but then the two of them splitting time really grew on me.  But on 'Hypnotize' Serj has all but lost the job of lead singer.  Daron is Gladys Knight and Serj is a Pip.<br /><br />I guarantee that 'Hypnotize' will severly disappoint, if not down right offend, long-time fans of SOAD.  Gone are the gnarly days of old.  Now, don't get me wrong:  I realize that bands have to grow and mature and I'm fine with it.  I have truly enjoyed everything they've done from their debut up to 'Mezmerize', but 'Hypnotize' is rubbish.  I really hope the band comes out and says that this album is a joke, that they made the worst album they possibly could just to see if they could get good reviews.  Thats the only thing that would regain my faith in this band.<br /><br />My advice:  skip 'Hypnotize' and go listen to anything else they've ever done.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|This was a cute movie.  It wasn't the funniest movie I've ever seen but it was still pretty fun to watch.  I laughed out loud a few times which to me is the way I judge all comedies.  If it doesn't make me laugh out loud at least once then it's just not up to snuff for me!  I think Will Ferrell is usually a good bet for some fun entertainment (although Kicking and Screaming was a real stinker in my opinion).  This was a good one though even for the kids which is a nice surprise.  We picked both this one and Christmas with the Kranks to watch this year and I have to say this one was much funnier than the Kranks if you ask me.  Never the less, if you're going for a Christmas movie I'd have to say A Christmas Story still can't be beat for laugh out loud funny.
B00023B1LC|3.0|Having first watched the 1988 TV mini series starring Richard Chamberlain, I've just come to appreciate what great film making is all about.    This 2002 remake simply pales in comparison. The villain in this remake lacks substance, he doesn't feel evil, he just paces around the office like every other paranoid beauracrat. Matt Damon is pretty good in this remake, he carries the movie, but still he is not Richard Chamberlain. The female leading character is plain annoying. She comes across not so much as helpless but plain dumb and annoying. And she keeps repeating the \\"S\\" word in German. Is it really fashionable nowadays to repeatedly say the \\"S\\" word in a foreign language so it doesn't get beeped out? She must have said it like 20 times.    And the director, for crying out loud, this whole movie feels like an independent film on steroids compared to the 1988 TV mini series.
B000002KOG|4.0|I really like this album. I was surprised when I first played it because I expected something different, having heard this album after many others. It reminds me a bit of \\"On The Beach\\" which in my opinion is a \\"moody masterpiece\\", however, this album is a bit more (but not much) commercial in my opinion, (Well, commercial by Neil Standards anyway).
B000BTJDGC|4.0|With eerie atmosphere that sticks with you throughout its duration, \\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\\" is a compelling and well-drawn tale of horror and courtroom drama.  In it, Laura Linney plays Erin Bruner, an aggressive (and agnostic) junior partner at her law firm who jumps at the chance to defend a Catholic priest in a negligent homicide case.  She has a track record of \\"getting off\\" guilty parties and she also wants to make senior partner.  With a high profile case like this, she'd be a fool to pass it up.  Unfortunately for her, the case isn't as easy to digest.  It involves a young lady's death after a failed exorcism.  The girl, Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter), had been diagnosed by medical professionals to be both epileptic and psychotic.  However, under the guidance of their parish priest, Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson), the family takes Emily off of her medication and seeks to have her undergo an exorcism in an attempt to remove her demons.<br /><br />The case is very interesting to watch as it plays out on the screen.  Campbell Scott is perfect as the prosecutor attempting to find Father Moore guilty as charged.  He attacks the medical angle of the case while Linney's character, getting hammered in the courthouse, attempts to prove that Emily actually was possessed by some sort of demonic forces.  The deeper that she and Father Moore get involved in the case, the stranger things get.<br /><br />With time split between flashbacks of Emily's agonizing experience and the battle in the courtroom, this tale is woven in such a way that the viewer has little relief from the tension that builds.  The story moves at a pace that builds on fear and faith, making for a brilliant ride.<br /><br />The acting is superb in this film.  Carpenter literally changes from a sweet and innocent young girl into a ravaged carcass under the grip of no less than six demons.  One demon in particular will be quite familiar to all of us.  Wilkinson is believable as the parish priest intent on telling Emily's story with no regard for his own life.  As stated before, Scott handles his role in superior fashion.  Perhaps the character who changes more than any other (excepting Emily) is Laura Linney's.  Though she begins this film as an agnostic, her soul is chipped at by the dark forces she is fighting in the courtroom.<br /><br />With equal parts drama and religious struggle, \\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\\" is one of the best films to come out this year.  It will make you question your faith, fear the unknown, and, perhaps, even strengthen your own beliefs.  Highly recommended for its wonderful and horrid tale, though this unrated version is nothing for young children to see.t intent on telling Emily's story with no regard for his own life.

B000AADYRQ|4.0|I don't know why people are saying that they've \\"lost something\\" in the jump from indie to major label. \\"Plans\\" sounds very similar, in my opinion, to \\"Transatlanticism.\\" Just because Death Cab for Cutie has become more popular with the release of this new CD, doesn't mean they have sacrificed an element of originality or the like to better suit the wishes of the mainstream audience. It's just that they're starting to receive wider recognition, and their music has always been something that different kinds of people could like. Anyway, I think I like \\"Plans\\" slightly better than \\"Transatlanticism,\\" particularly the lyrics, which seem to have deepened and gained a more poetic quality. I don't know why \\"Soul Meets Body\\" has become the main \\"pop\\" song off that album, as \\"I Will Follow You Into the Dark\\" is beautiful, more melodic, and would most likely be more pleasing to the mainstream ear. Well, the first few songs off albums always tend to be given the most attention at first, I suppose. Maybe they'll discover the later songs...later.  <br /> <br />The only thing I would mention as a negative comment is that Death Cab for Cutie is almost too mellow, too staid, too \\"dowdy,\\" if that word can be used here, for me. Gibbard's voice is on the verge of being annoying sometimes. They're different, but they're not too experimental or venturous, really. Don't let that stop you from acquainting yourself with their music, though, if you haven't already. You might like the taste they leave on your tongue.
B000BBOUU4|2.0|Come one come all to Willie Wonkas's house of horrors. And kids, don't take candy from strangers especially if it's chocolate from the Wonka factory.  Willie's running the old bait and switch here. You may think possession of the Golden Ticket will allow you entrance to chocolate nirvana where you'll get what you desire but oops...joke's on you kid. Mr. Wonka's going to give you what he thinks you deserve. All odious brats better run for your lives. And yes that goes for the audience too. I admit I hate the story and think it's mean spirited and sadistic. But I went to see the movie because of the collaboration of Johnny Depp and Tim Burton who take an artistic vision and run with it in a quirky interesting way. And true to form the film is a Burton world of the fantastic, a huge mesmerizing storybook reality taking place in another dimension.  This time you are grateful to leave at the end and put it back on the shelf. Burton has attempted to give Wonka some humanity by inserting a \\"back story\\" not part of Dahl's original book.  Wonka's present life is intermittently tormented by flashbacks of his childhood of abuse and cruelty at the hands of his father.  Does this make Wonka more sympathetic? No. Depp always a brilliantly inventive actor wasn't able to make me like this character in any way shape or form. I know this is supposed to be a children's movie but it's misanthropy makes it one that not every kid or adult will enjoy. I was not amused.
078322737X|5.0|Very simple, this one never wears out and even for someone who doesnt like to see movies more than once, this is one of the few I will. Everyone involved in this film is either a cult or superstar heavyweight status and have memorable careers and many shooting and character developement ideas have borrowed and owe this movie thier careers! Goodnight my sweet darling and tell em' the Wolfman sent you! Rock and roll beautiful cars and chicks forever...
B0000025DV|5.0|Aah. ELO.  What a great band and what a masterpiece of an album.  I got this album about 3 years after its release, when I first became really aware of the album.  This album is at the top of my list of favourite albums from the 70's, including Breakfast in America by Supertramp.  Jeff really achieved what he initially set out to do with the group: combine the best elements of rock and classical.  The songs are unique, using interesting keyboard sounds and melodies.  The strings swell and are so beautiful to listen to. My only complaint is that Believe Me Now is only about one minute long.  I also loved the album art for this album.  This is definitely a masterpiece and sounds just as great as it did in 1978.

0380715430|4.0|Bill Bryson is a writer of fiction in many ways.  You must always pause and wonder if what he is telling you is actually true. The Mother Tongue is classic Bryson. Chalk full of stories, anecdotes and questionable facts but so amusingly presented that you just can't resist. Sometimes you'll chuckle at his wit and other times you'll laugh at his inaccuracies but you'll have a fabulous time. Just don't quote him
B000A88F22|4.0|I've always thought Britney Spears had a great bod and great tunes since she hit the charts in 1998.  But I never thought much of her personal life post-2003's In the Zone because after the too publicized breakup with first love Justin Timberlake (my opinion, her PERFECT match) her girl next door persona dropped increasingly.  I never saw her UPN show Chaotic during its initial TV showing, but I had a feeling it'd end up being a blatant marketing attempt (since 2003's MTV Newlyweds starring Jessica Simpson and then-hubby Nick Lachey proved reality TV could be a great factor for publicity).  But I finally saw Chaotic and realized it was much more personal than most reality shows are, even though the amount of footage of Spears smoking and talking about sex really showcased an entirely new side opposite of the typically seen sexy \\"Toxic\\" Britney.  Sure, it's chaotic in a shouldn't-have-been-done-in-the-first-place kind of way, but the show did have its moments.  One thing, though: STOP SMOKING!!
B000028U0Y|5.0|There are legendary albums but JOHNNY CASH AT FOLSOM PRISON simply goes WAY beyond that label!!  As I am writing this, December 25, 2005 this 37-year-old album is in the TOP FIVE best selling CDS of the many hundreds of thousands of CDS available on the website.  Johnny Cash brought stone-hard country music to the masses back then and he is clearly still doing it today.  This is an album that belongs in every collection of popular American music.
B000BKJ78U|1.0|You guys know who should really be the emperor in the movies? Rather than replacing Clive Revill with Ian McDiarmid for these so-called new and improved versions of the classic movies we all know and love, George Lucas should have donned the dark robes himself for the part. Imagine the terror he could ensue on the rebel scum! Instead of destroying entire planets, he could simply start changing all of their favorite movies! And when the new one is complete in all its terrible glory, he'd destroy all copies of the original. The rebels would surrender without hesitation!  <br />Seriously though, Mr. Lucas, you should be ashamed. I'm absolutly sickened at the way you treat your fans. Star Wars geeks (myself included) love these films. We buy your merchandise, we play the video games, we argue about which of the first three is best(Empire!), and we wait in line, some for days, just to be first to view the new trilogy unfold. All of this stems from one film. One movie that caused an iternational phenomenon upon its original release in 1977. That film is \\"Star Wars-Episode IV: A New Hope\\", and it gained perhaps the largest cult following for a movie ever. \\"Use the Force\\" became a household phrase, and it all happened literally overnight. <br />All this hysteria, Mr. Lucas, and you don't think there's an intrest in seeing the ORIGINAL trilogy on DVD? Star Wars fans have went through a lot over the years, but this just might be the straw that breaks the bantha's back. RE-releasing the new editions without the bonus disc, sticking the original poster on the front, and misleading thousands (if not millions) of die-hard loyal fans into buying a product they already own and are DISSAPOINTED WITH.  <br />So, congratulations on being able to use your fans to add to your undeserved and grossly overweight fortune. Congratulations on turning one of the greatest achivements in film-making into an incresingly cheesy and soulless franchise that doesn't care what fans would like to see but only about making money any way possible. And finally, congratulations on losing this particular fan. I doubt that I am alone in feeling this alienated. I hope your bank account is well fed and you are happy with the way you make your fans feel, but from this end, us Geeks only have dissapointment and resentment to bring to the table.
B000AYQJJ2|4.0|Bangladesh was the forefather of the live aid types of concerts. Here George, with a little help from his friends (including Ringo, Eric Clapton and Dylan), pulled together a wonderful concert event to help the people of Bangladesh. It has often been reported that George extended the invite to both Paul and John to join him with both declining (now that would have been some concert). The packaging for the deluxe set is great. The DVDs have plenty of extras and the concert is a joy to watch. What struck me was the total absence of flashy showmanship - just no nonsense, bare knuckles playing by a line-up of muscians who were very much at the top of their game at the time. One oddity was Badfinger being relegated to back-up (acoustic guitars) with no spotlight songs. Most embarrassing moment was Ringo forgetting the words to \\"It Don't Come Easy\\" which leaves the viewer scratching their head since it was his one big hit coming into the concert (he kind of mumbled his way through it at points - ouch!). All that being said, it is a great piece of documented rock history for Beatle fans and rock collector alike. You won't be disappointed.
B0000041DF|5.0|I love the Rach 3 (and 4) and I have essentially all of the major recordings.  When the Hough complete set came out, I decided over a span of several weeks to listen to all the version I had.  I will never give up my Horowitz/Coates, Horowitz/Barbirolli, or others including those by Janis, Kapell, Gutierrez, but I will always be partial to the Argerich because it was her performance that made me appreciate the work.  I agree the Horowitz played it faster but Argerich rapport with Chailly with this work is incomparable.  Her 1st movement cadenza is truly frightening.  There is a rumor that Argerich never authorize this release and that she was actually upset when it was released.  It's completely unedited.  If you guys don't believe me, go to [...] buy this video on DVD and see.  Yes, a video of this performance exists, and it is in excellent shape.  It's a truly wonderful experience to see her play this work.  The planets were aligning perfectly that night.  A legendary performance!
B00005JO1Y|3.0|My biding image of this movie is that of one grey, rubbery lump collapsing on top of another.    But it's a fair bit of a journey getting there and beyond.    Cynics may think that had it not been for Peter Jackson's reputation as director of `The Lord of the Rings' preceding him on this movie, it's likely no one would have looked for a remake of a love story between a woman and a giant ape. A contemporary version would be at equal risk of becoming facetious and insincere as the original might have been, appealing more to the camp-and-outrage dollar rather than heartstrings. Can, then, this movie stand on its own, independent of what one expects, and is virtually certain of receiving, from Jackson and his team at Weta? The `King Kong' for our time isn't perfect, but, had `The Lord of the Rings' not been made, Jackson's rendering still would have made a strong statement about his eye as a storyteller working with film, and his concerns pertaining to entertainment and escapism, complemented by a knowledge of what's necessary for emotional resonance.     Everyone looks for the showdowns and pursuits involving creatures in this movie, and, while the wait for them is slightly testing, patience pays off in confrontations and chases that become unrelentingly manic the moment they start. Hence, the barrage of dinosaur stampedes, attacks by oversized critters that could only have come from Jackson's demented imagination, and some tremendous vigour from the headlining monkey himself, be it in taking on three T-Rexes or Broadway. There is the occasional echo of things done before - Adrien Brody, Jack Black and the rest of the rescue team running frantically between the legs of dinosaurs (some fortunately emerging untouched, others sardonically trampled to death) is reminiscent of horsemen scuttling about the feet of huge tusked creatures in `The Return of the King' - but that's more than made up for with imaginative, original sequences that genuinely keep surprising you and keep you on the edge. A fight between Kong and two T-Rexes as he struggles to save Naomi Watts amidst a tangle of vines is staged with such inventiveness you can't help but laugh. The grisly confrontation between the last dinosaur and Kong that follows sees the camera placing the audience in the very midst of the savagery as the two wrestle with unfettered brutality. Kong's rampage through the streets of New York, more than a spectacle of gleefully bestial destruction, is fuelled by such rage that it's actually heartbreaking, indeed the stirring culmination of a truly moving love story developed between Kong and Naomi Watts.    But the success achieved in fully forming the characters of the leading man and lady is as far as the characterisation goes in this movie. Black's obsessive, self-proclaimed craftsman in film drives the story forward from one incredible development to another (he is, after all, the reason that Kong leaves Skull Island), but his learning his lesson in the end, about how his ambitiousness has proven detrimental and destroyed a bond that enabled Beauty to tame the Beast, is unconvincing, and exacerbated by an abrupt ending that sees Black's character reaching a realisation that's inadequately expressed by the movie's closing line (`It was beauty that killed the beast'). Brody gets the chance to be an action man here, but that he turns out to be more than that owes much to Watts, who conveys convincingly the confusion and dilemma over her feelings for an animal and a man, an inconceivable, absurd love triangle of sorts.     All the character strands are primarily introduced on the voyage to Skull Island (which outlasts its welcome, as noble as the writers' intentions in having it are), and what's regrettable is how hardly any of the peripheral characters' stories are resolved. A brief allusion to `Heart of Darkness' as the crew sets foot on the island, for one, makes a nice little thoughtful surprise, but it's ultimately never clear if it really speaks for any character in particular. It might say something for Jamie Bell's character. The problem is his seeming attachment to Watts's character is never properly established, if it's meant to exist at all, and thus doesn't receive much in the way of the audience's investment. His shady past isn't reconciled with his inexplicably urgent need to see the rescue mission through (which, at best, is weakly justified by his supposed feelings for Ann Darrow); and his close relations with members of the ship's crew are given little more than a perfunctory examination, and are only evident by Bell's dramatic emoting over the death of the man who found him as a child, which in itself doesn't evoke sympathy due to a failure to set down an emotional precedent. What `shackles' might Bell's character have grown so used to that his desire to discover what intrigues him should threaten to be deadened, only to be rejuvenated by a desperate `need to know', which then, supposedly, drives him to seek out the kidnapped Ann Darrow? Whatever the mysteries of his character, whether or not they be necessary, we never see any more of him beyond Skull Island, which naturally leads to the question: Was he, or any of the supporting cast of characters for that matter, really necessary, or little more than a cursory attempt at populating a film that doesn't seem to have much need for them, other than providing a means for the lead characters to remain miraculously unscathed? The `Heart of Darkness' reference might even have said something for Kong, but how it's connected to his loneliness or inaccessibility as a beast and, therefore, a character unfortunately prone to misunderstanding, or fear before understanding, isn't clear either. A palpable wish to connect is at least demonstrated empathetically by a monkey of considerable nuance (hats off, Andy Serkis and the animation team), and the writers and director aptly capitalise on this to map the heart of the movie.    But this adventure does sweep one away - one truly has to see it to fully appreciate how dramatic, and tragic, an aerial shot of a giant monkey tumbling off the roof of a tall building, after a lingering shot of its dilating pupil, really is. `King Kong' doesn't exactly have chest-pounding bragging rights, but audiences will be more than happy to hear it proclaim its return to the big screen.
B00005O5CM|5.0|Reese Witherspoon plays Elle Woods, a \\"dumb blonde\\" who, behind the bright clothes and love for parties, is really very smart.  She often uses her brains, both in school and in fashion, to help out her friends or pick out the perfect outfit.  But she's never had the opportunity to really put her knowledge to use...until her boyfriend (who she thought wanted to marry her) broke up with her to go to law school and find a more sophisticated girlfriend. <br /> <br />Now Elle is trying to become a lawyer, to become the girl that her ex-boyfriend is looking for.  The movie is funny and entertaining, combining an original storyline with the typical story about a comical heroine that everybody loves.  There was hardly a dull moment in the entire movie, and now I can't wait to see the sequel!  There is some sexual talk, fairly bad language every now and then, and of younger children viewing, hence the PG-13 rating.  But I thought it was very good, and I recommend it to those looking for a fun comedy about a girl who everyone thought was ditzy showing what she is really made of.
B00005JO1Y|3.0|Okay, I know anyone seeing a flick about a giant ape has to suspend a bit of belief, but too many parts of this \\"King Kong\\" remake are so absurdly unbelievable that it ruins what could have been a great adventure movie.<br /><br />I'm a fan of '33 original and (less-so) of the '76 version as well, so I was naturally quite psyched-up about this new version, especially after hearing about the myriad dinosaur and giant bug scenes on the island. The first sign of trouble became apparent in the first 5 minutes: There was a bit of a campy vibe; the material was not approached seriously as in the '33 and '76 versions (some have complained that the '76 version had too much campiness [not really accurate], well, multiply that about five times for this version). But I accepted this. Besides, it wasn't too bad and the film did settle into a fairly serious drama/adventure mode.<br /><br />The first-hour New York and sailing sequences are a good set-up for the rest of the film; those withe ADHD might have a problem with it, however.<br /><br />What first blew me away were the sequences involving the arrival to the island, the mysterious village/ruins and the utterly horrific natives. These scenes beat out both the '33 and '76 versions.<br /><br />The introduction to Kong as he takes the bride offering is well done as well. Director Peter Jackson decided to not fully reveal Kong at this point; only giving glimpses. I commend him for doing something a bit different, but the '76 version of this scene is more powerful.<br /><br />Okay, here's where the film takes a big wrong turn. The island scenes with the multitude of dinosaurs and giant bugs SHOULD have been great but the story turns into a laughably unrealistic cartoon. There's a 5 minute brontosaurus stampede scene with 15 people running WITH the colossal beasts, RIGHT UNDER THEM, keeping up with them (!!), and, for the most part, not getting killed. At this point all credibility is lost and you can kiss any suspension of belief goodbye.<br /><br />Then there are many scenes of Kong yanking Naomi Watts around in such a violent manner that there's just no way she could realistically remain conscious, let alone alive.<br /><br />The giant bug sequence is a good addition to the Kong story but it's marred by overkill and another ridiculously implausible scene: A character is attacked by a number of big bugs and is moving around like crazy trying to get them off while a young man, inexperienced with guns, grabs a machine gun and shoots all the bugs WITHOUT HITTING THE GUY. This goes on for a full minute and a half and is totally unbelievable. This scene is supposed to be suspenseful and horrific, instead everyone was laughing and thinking \\"Yeah, right.\\"<br /><br />On the positive side, the scenes involving Kong taking on THREE t-rexes are truly thrilling. Despite this, this sequences reveals what's wrong with Jackson's version: Kong doesnt just fight one t-rex, he doesn't just fight two t-rexes -- he fights THREE! Simultaneously! It's as if Jackson said to himself: \\"Okay, let's take every action scene and overdo it to the extreme -- more is definitely better!! The first film had one t-rex, we'll have three -- Yee Haw!!!\\"<br /><br />The first film worked (and the second one too, to a degree) because it kept the story in the realm of plausibility. What if there really was an island with large primordial creatures on it? What would it be like if such an island was actually discovered? Not so in Jackson's remake. All plausibility is thrown to the wind in favor of cartooney CGI action. It's called over-doing it or overkill. Sometimes less is more.<br /><br />Then there's the mystery of how they get the unconscious Kong on to the ship and back to New York, but that can be overlooked.<br /><br />On the positive side, the New York scenes are all done very well, including the heavily criticized \\"skating\\" sequence. One big criticism, however, is Ann Darrow's lack of clothing in the New York winter. Thisis another huge plausibility blunder. All she has on is a skimpy dress. The scene where Kong skates around on the ice is supposed to be touching, instead all I could think about was how freezing the woman must be (but she never showed it). I thought the same thoughts during the long Empire State Building sequence at the climax. Do you know how cold it is on top of the highest building in the world (at that time) in the winter? Once again, a potentially suspenseful sequence is marred by another unnecessary implausibility.<br /><br />As for Naomi Watts, she's no stunning beauty, but she does a fantastic job in the role. Jessica Lange, as the incredibly sexy Dwan in the '76 rendition, plays this part best IMHO.<br /><br />I went into \\"King Kong\\" thinking this would surely be the quintessential version, but was disappointed. Yeah, it's fun, yeah, it's entertaining, but the campy approach to the material and the absurd implausibilities heavily mar it. Does Peter Jackson think we're all a bunch of morons? Hey, I'm a big adventure film fan, but I don't care if I ever see this bubble-gum flick again. If you're an intelligent, thinking person don't waste your time or money on this Roadrunner cartoon.<br /><br />The '33 version is still the best one, despite its understandable dated-ness. As for the '76 version, say what you want, but at least it took the story SERIOUS. This one's undeniably fun, but it's a bit of a joke.<br /><br />\\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" is one of the greatest adventure films of all time with quite a few acceptable implausibilities. Now imagine \\"Raiders\\" being TEN TIMES less believable, and you'd have a good impression of this \\"King Kong\\" remake.e where Kong skates around on the ice is supposed to be touching, instead all I could think about was how freezing the woman must be (but she never showed it).

B000AMJDHY|4.0|I'm new to the whole reviewing thing. <br />So I'll just lay it out as simply as I can. <br />Mmkay? <br /> <br />The Good - I hate to say but I love all but two of the songs on this cd. I came to it horribly biased. Yes, there are songs about heartache, cheating, and general emo topics. But there are also songs that touch on the subject of artistic subterfuge found in modern day music. \\"I for one can see no blood from their hearts or the wrists they allegedly slit.\\" The songs are also great to sing along to. I know some of you are rolling your eyes. But they are. Panic has also managed to feature instruments that many of my peers (I'm 17) don't even remember. The cello, the violin, the big band sound found in \\"There's A Good Reason....\\" Being a huge band geek I was impressed.  <br /> <br />The Bad - Sigh. Track number 1, like interlude on MCR's \\"Three Cheers\\" album is complete crap. But instead of doing one filler track (They don't say and/or sing anything!) they do two! TWO!!! <br />Number 8 is just a waste of my life and I DON'T recommend listening to it with the lights off. It gets very creepy circus at the end. Another thing that I can't stand is the electronic beats and synth sounds that they have managed to tack on to a number of tracks. It's like a bad Hellogoodbye. And while I love the big band sound, I hate the actual old movie and radio features. I get it. They're trying to make themselved \\"original\\". The first time I heard I got a headache. <br /> <br />That damn exclamtion point- Yep, it's pretty pointless. As Spin put it \\"One of the worst exclamation point placements EVER.\\" <br />I agree. <br /> <br />So, while I do recommend this cd. I do forewarn you. It's a bit offputting at first.  <br />It's good raw material and I have faith that Panic!At The Disco, like wine, good cheese, and my Chucks, will get better with age and practice.
0060925000|5.0|\\"A Suitable Boy\\" - An absolute beauty. Apart from Fyodor Dostoevsky's 'Crime and Punishment' (which I managed to read a dozen times), 'A Suitable Boy' is one of the very best novels that I've ever read (keeping in mind, I usually read 4 novels per month). I can't call it an absolutely flawless novel, but undoubtedly is a wonderful read for anyone quintessentially possessing a slight interest in 1950s India. Let me delineate the good as well as the bad sides of the work more carefully:<br /><br />A) Good Sides:<br /><br />1. Classy description of things/individuals/situations/places.<br /><br />2. Keeps the reader engrossed by couplets, sometimes really funny, at times, with a slight emotional pang and political sentiment.<br /><br />3. The characters are very well-developed.<br /><br />4. Situations unfold themselves very nicely.<br /><br />5. Apart from the socio-economic situation in post-Independence India, the political situation in India as well as in the Indian National Congress (INC) amongst Hindu-Muslim leaders is very aptly exemplified.<br /><br />6. Different ideologies are exemplified in an absolutely fabulous manner. Religious fanaticism, dogmatisms, romanticism, liberalism etc. are very well illustrated.<br /><br />7. Each and every incident throughout the novel has a reason for happening; it's not that it just happens. Plausible consequences and future actions/incidents are very well balanced.<br /><br />B) Bad Sides:<br /><br />1. The exit: way too quickly. As if Seth wanted to wrap up the whole thing in a week's time!!<br /><br />2. Lata's choice of choosing Haresh over the other equally well-balanced suitors (Amit and Kabir) is NOT explained. Though the readers are to get a hint during her last discussion with Malati, yet much remains to be asked.<br /><br />3. A general/overall fate of some of the pseudo-protagonists is left unanswered.<br /><br />4. A slightly over indulgence with the 'agrarian reform' Bill. For people with no political interest, kindly omit the chapters and proceed with the protagonist's story.<br /><br />Apart from this, I think it's a wonderful read. I personally consider, makes a nice gift to someone too (if the person concerned is interested in knowing Indian culture more deeply, but without getting bogged down in the socio-economic politico status quo during the post-Independence India). Overall, 5 stars!<br /><br />NB: Someone in the reviews mentioned `in-apt' style of writing from Seth's part. A total *.

B000BM6AVA|4.0|The follow up to the #1 Billboard album 'Mezmerize' that was released earlier this year, 'Hypnotize' completes the double album release.  If you love the band's approach to politics, war, society and love, you'll love this album. Don't expect a mezmerize part 2. This album is more serious, yet has those frantic and crazy moments in U-Fig, vicinity of Obcenity, etc.  The only thing wrong with it is that daron sings. to be honest, daron cant sing.. hes the worst singer ive ever heard. why did you give up your spot as lead singer, serj? daron should realize that he has an atrocious voice and stick to hes day job as the guitarist. so... heres the song breakdown      1. Attack   4/10  worst song on the album    2. Dreaming   10/10   way more SOAD than the first one. i love the chorus    3. Kill Rock 'N Roll   5/10   darons singing ruins this song. he should stick with the guitar.    4. Hypnotize   6/10   overplayed    5. Stealing Society  8/10   this is when the album takes a u-turn for the best and turns into a good record. this song is pretty good until darons voice comes in. after that, the song is corrupt.    6. Tentative   10/10   this is a good one. not much daron.    7. U-Fig   10/10   excellent song. the second the song started i knew it was going to be great.one of the best songs on the album. more of the system of a down humor in this.     8. Holy Mountains   10/10 good song also. no daron in this also. just back up. very angry yet soothing.    9. Vicinity Of Obscenity    20/10   this in the only song  that competes with the new version of soldier side. great song hands down. very fast singing reminds me of revenga alot.    10. She's Like Heroin    9/10   this song is kind of bazzar but good. lyrics about men whereing dresses snd selling yourself for heroin remind me of the old days.    11. Lonely Day   10/10   darons peak of the album. this is the only song that darons voice sounds good. excellent ballad.    12. Soldier Side  20/10   absolue best song on the album. this is a greatending to the first soldier side and the album. alot of irony is used in this song ie. \\"they were crying when their sons left;god is whereing black\\"    overall, if your a true fan you should purchase this. if your new to SOAD and like this album, you should check out their self-titled cd, Tocicity and Steal This Album.
0805076476|5.0|Fight Club, by Chuck Palahniuk, is a contemporary fiction novel that centers on the first-person narrator of the book, a friend of Tyler Durden. When the narrator of the book, whose name is never revealed in the story, meets Tyler, he is thrust into a completely different world - an exciting, dark world that challenges everything in his boring, quotidian life. Other ordinary citizens with ordinary jobs - lawyers, bankers, office workers, and even policemen - are introduced to Tyler's fight club, where violent fights with complete strangers take place. As the plot unravels, more and more is learned about Tyler and the narrator while fight club develops and expands. Tyler's invented activities become more and more dangerous, and the narrator finds his original life degenerating before his eyes.  I found this to be an excellent novel, written in Palahniuk's unique, captivating style. This book has broken through the clich themes and plots of other books and carries a unique sense of reality.          Chuck Palahniuk's genius-type thinking is seen in the plot construction and characters he creates from imagination. I highly recommend and encourage this novel to anyone who wants to catch a glimpse of a world that challenges the mundane rote of wake up, eat, job/school, eat, job/school, miscellaneous activity, home, eat, sleep. In his book, Palahniuk shows a place where ordinary people like Tyler Durden are enabled to change the world and break free from the rules of society. An unusual, interesting, and impacting read for anyone.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|I thought this movie was right on!  One doesn't have to be convinced about diabolical possession.  But one does have to admit to the possibility.

B00005JO1Y|5.0|With all respect for the talents of Mr. Peter Jackson, clearly the most promising young directors on the rise, I'll be the first to admit that I was among the skeptics who saw no reason whatsoever for the making of this film. King Kong was remade once, please remember, in 1976 by Robert Guillermin, to appalling results. The 1933 original was a perfect film, a classic. Why try to make it again? What purpose could it possibly serve other than being a mild curiosity? Did we learn nothing from Psycho? <br /> <br />Having seen it, I'm still not sure there was any real point in remaking King Kong. Peter Jackson's film is no news; it has nothing substantial that the original film didn't, other than a few extra T. Rexes and a couple of very disgusting giant insects. Unlike the 1976 version, Jackson's film doesn't alter any of the characters or plot elements; in fact, it clearly takes place in the 30's, when the original film was made. That's mainly in its favor; still, because of these reasons and more it's clearly a tribute and not an independent film with by its own right. <br /> <br />And that's just what makes it so good. Jackson made King Kong with as much love for Merian Cooper as he had for Tolkien when he made Lord of the Rings. Jackson shows real care and respect for the material he works with; more than that he shows care and respect for classic monster films and for cinema in general. King Kong is a joyful celebration of cinema (right down to a wink and nod to the wonderful starlet of the original film, Fay Wray, who was meant to have a cameo in the film but passed away before she could make it). Peter enjoys every second of renewing the beloved film of his youth, and we enjoy it with him. King Kong is a wild ride, a movie made perfectly that never stops entertaining for a minute, and it's the greatest fun you'll know. <br /> <br />The cast is for the most part excellent. Naomi Watts does a great job filling in for the late, great Fay Wray, and her Vaudeville scene on Skull Island is outstanding. Best among the cast is Jack Black, a fantastic actor who is yet to reach his peak, who does a fantastic job filling the mighty shoes of Robert Armstrong as Carl Denham. The rest of the cast includes Adrien Brody, Thomas Kretschmann (The Pianist), Kyle Chandler (Early Edition) and Jamie Bell (Billy Elliott). The real star though is Andy Serkis, who apart from doing a swell side-part as trusty sidekick Lumpy, plays Kong himself, to outstanding results. In the same technology used for the creation of Gollum, Andy played out the movements and facial expressions for Kong and these were used for the animated character. Like he did with Gollum, Andy shows remarkable control of his body language, and Kong turns out to be the most impressive and convincing CG character seen on the big screen yet. <br /> <br />King Kong is not in any way an essential film, I certainly could have lived without it, but damn, I'm glad it was made, and I'm glad Peter made it! If you love the original and classic cinema in general, it's highly recommended. Even if you don't, it's still guaranteed to be three of the most entertaining hours of your life.
B00005QG9J|4.0|Coming from a different world, I got interested in Incubus after seeing the movie <br />\\"Stealth\\" ... which was an unbelievably dumb movie except that the soundtrack (by <br />BT) and songs (3 originals by Incubus) were great.  I came online to Amazon to buy <br />Incubus' backlist and get to know them, but argh, they are under the Sony label. <br /> <br />Literally \\"under\\".  I just figured out that the movie \\"Stealth\\" is also a Sony product <br />... with all those pushes, like the pilot saying, \\"at least it's good music, man\\" ... <br />oh dear ... I've been duped by Sony self-promotion.  Did I really like the music or <br />was I just being suggestable?  Does everyone understand that this is going on <br />except for me?  Well, after Sony's rootkit attack on their customers, Sony CDs (and <br />now DVDs) are not welcome in my players nor my house:  I just don't trust them. <br /> <br />Incubus, if you read this and if you are a real band: (1) get another label, (2) good <br />work on the music for Stealth, and (3) get another label; until then, goodbye.  If you <br />are not a real band (i.e., Sony's lapdog), then shame on you, posers; goodbye. <br /> <br />

B000BOH8XW|5.0|....which is the number one reason I am giving this record 5 stars. Being half Lebanese (her father is of Lebanon ancestry, which is an arab country), she has compassion towards those in the middle east, and I feel it somewhat unfair that the music industry seems to almost try to hide that side of Shakira. Just because we are currently in a war with that part of our world is no reason to simply harp on this woman's mothers side (which is hispanic). In fact, I think now is a great time for american's of middle eastern descent to have a person to look up to, and Shakira is a wonderful example of that. I have no middle eastern blood in me, however my step-father is Iranian, so I have always been interested in that side of the world. Here is my review of this record:<br /><br />1.How Do You Do: This is Shakira questioning why muslims and jews are enemies. 'Would you tell me why the cat fights the dog? Do you go to the mosque or the synagogue?' All have made mistakes, and all should be forgiven. She prays in arabic, as well as hebrew. I think this song would make a powerful statement as a music video. I picture Shakira wearing an Arab turban as well as a Star of David necklace. Two accessories that would normally never be placed together.<br /><br />2. Don't Bother: Great alternative rock track. Shakira shows her insecurities on this one, as well as her vengeful side, and the video seemed to be like a cross between Fiona Apple and Courtney Love.<br /><br />3. Illegal: A very beautiful sparse ballad. I didn't care much for all those songs Santana did with Michelle Branch, but Shakira's expressive vocals bring much more to this track then another artist would have.<br /><br />4. The Day And The Time: This is the english version of Dia Especial. Incredible lyrics, and unique vocal stylings with a lot of feeling that crescendo down. Has elements similar to something Coldplay might do.<br /><br />5. Animal City: Shakira begins this track with arabic chanting, then the song goes into a rock/spanish type of feel. She describes how the entertainment business is a dog eat dog world that a celebrity must learn to deal with.<br /><br />6.Dreams For Plans: While listening to this track I felt like I was getting an inside peak into Shakira and Antonio's (the son of the former Argentinian president) secret world. She's wondering if their relationship has forever changed due to her success in the states.<br /><br />7. Hey You: Adorable punkish track reminiscent of something No Doubt might have done on one of their early albums. This track does for vol.2 what 'Escondite Ingles' did for vol.1 Brought some raw new wave flavor!<br /><br />8. Your Embrace: Very beautiful ballad with a strong arangement. Could be this albums 'Underneath Your Clothes', which is one of my favorite Shakira songs of all time. I personally adored the Laundry Service record and still listen to it frequently.<br /><br />9.Costume Makes The Clown: Uh oh, did Shakira cheat on Antonio? That's what she seems to be stating on this rock track. Excellent arrangment, interesting lyrics. One of my favorite songs on this c.d. This is sort of the 'Poem To A Horse' song for this album, except Shakira is upset at herself on this one. Poem To A Horse', btw, was my favorite track off of LS, so I'm so glad she went rock on this album as well. Should be a single.<br /><br />10. Something: English version of 'Tus Pupilas'. I like this english version a lot, as I did the spanish one. Has a very ethereal, fresh, almost New Age feel to it. I can see the current kabbalistic Madonna loving this record, and would have perhaps wanted it for herself around her 'Ray Of Light' days.<br /><br />11.Timor: Raising awareness for East Timor (a country in Southeast Asia near the Middle East). This song has a somewhat newfangled techno beat to it, and the way she sings East Timor reminds me of the way Cyndi Lauper sings She-Bop. She started off this record with a religious political theme, and ends it with thesame theme.<br /><br />In a music world intuned to our world's plights, Shakira is no exception. She covers all bases on this one: religion, politics,and personal relationships. My picks for other singles besides Don't Bother would be Your Embrace, Costume Makes The Clown, and How Do You Do. Good job Shaki!n. She covers all bases on this one: religion, politics,and personal relationships.

B0002EXH54|1.0|i hate megadeath. the lead singer can't sing. hence the word \\"singer\\". his guitaring is overrated. when my guy friend was listening to this, i demanded he turn it off, because the songs are very bad. he got kicked out of metallica i heard. how hard can that be. he must really suck if you can get kicked out of metallica. megadeath is just another overrated metal band from the 1980's. listen to modern emo or punk like Green Day and avoid this. its an excuse for music. too many people on this website like this and it annoys me.
B00022M518|5.0|This is the definitive Eno album. But don't be confused. Even though this is catchier at first listen, Taking Tiger Mountain by strategy is the best by far!
B000008HZB|5.0|Jeff Lynne has a tendency to overproduce things, multi-tracking and overdubbing his music to death. He keeps his bombastic tendencies on a relatively short leash this time out, and while the songs here are still a bit overdone, his catchy pop melodies  shine through.<br /><br />The lead track \\"Every Little Thing\\" is a bouncy homage to classic Motown R&B, with a nice fat bass line and rich horn section. His covers of the classic torch songs \\"September Song\\" and \\"Stormy Weather\\" are especially noteworthy, because Lynne proves himself to be a very competent crooner. His sentimental renditions of these rank up there with the best. \\"Now You're Gone\\" is intriguing because it showcases Lynne using his voice like never before or since, along microtonal scales in an Indian or Middle Eastern style, as he wails for his lost love. \\"Don't Say Goodbye\\" is the kind of mournful appeal that Lynne's late Traveling Wilburys bandmate, Roy Orbison, built a career on. Lynne's voice doesn't have the range or timbre of Orbison's (hell, whose does? Orbison was one-of-a-kind.) but it can still evoke a deep melancholy.<br /><br />In short, one helluva collection of fine pop songs, just barely hidden beneath a layer of production gloss. Check it out.
B000B8QEYC|1.0|Enya needs a change, or shes gonna end up like the new-age version of Madonna.  Her fans who follow her blindly, will always give her good reviews. But this cd is Enyas worst.  Not one song on this CD remotely began to move me inside. The whole CD is luke-warm while trying to be overly sentimental. (reminding me of Madonna once again).  I could try to find a soung to recommend for download, but i cant even do that. <br /> <br />Enya is slowing slipping into the void where once good artists who fail to change end up. Madonna, Enigma... and now Enya.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Forrest Gump is a very hard movie to watch since I am an autistic physically disabled black dude who grew up in the racially charged 1960's.  I had always heard so much about Forrest Gump that made me not think it was the kind of movie I'd like watching so I usually avoided it with a passion.  Suddenly this Christmas friends of mine roped in into sitting through Forrest Gump and I was shocked by how much I absolutely loved this movie.<br /><br />The movie is vivid fictionalized but oddly realistic life seen through (disabled kid) Forrest Gump's eyes.  Forrest Gump's perspective on life was weird but strange as he was the movie felt real in the oddest ways I could imagine.  It is true watching life unfold through Forrest Gump's eyes offers a perspective that leaves you altered for the better if you have any heart and soul at all.  I owe this movie a huge appology because for years I just knew in my heart I'd hate Forrest Gump yet I ended up loving that it was so much like my own life experience growing up disabled in the 1960's when you got very little encouragement and help as a special needs kid.<br /><br />I suspect I disliked Forrest Gump because it came way too uncomfortably close to being exactly like my own life growing up disabled labelled the dummy or my neighborhood retard by grown ups and peers alike.  Like Forrest I had family members (grandparents mainly) who loved me and fought hard, long and tirelessly to be sure I had the same opportunities for advancement other kids had.  I saw the park bench scene in the movie trailer and felt it was acted way too simplistically almost as if the movie was poking fun at or making light of the disabled so I never wanted to watch it.  Forrest Gump threatened to reopen many painful memories from my own past growing up disabled and those sores were still sensitive in my heart so why watch it.<br /><br />I am much stronger as a disabled person now than I have ever been before so I let myself be roped into watching Forrest Gump.  I liked and understood myself now so I risked veiwing Forrest Gump this Christmas Eve surrounded by friends.  Anyways this Christmas Eve friends wanted me to see the Forrest Gump DVD after hearing I had still never seen it so I saw the movie from beginning to end.  Watching Forrest Gump was still very painful because, I experienced personally so much of the torment Forrest did going to regular school as a disabled kid in the mid 60's myself.  More than a few times I wanted to leave the movie and just go sit in a corner, retreat into my own autistic world to cry tears of solidarity for Forrest Gump in a place where my heart was my only witness but I did not.  I stayed the course and watched the whole Forrest Gump movie despite my own pains being vigorously stirred. I gave my word to friends I'd watch to all of Forrest Gump and a Wolf without honor is no Wolf at all.<br /><br />Yes Forrest Gump stirred up some real painful experiences in my past but that said the movie answered some real unresolved questions I had leaving me much stronger, secure and prouder as a disabled man for my Forrest Gump experience.  In my eyes a truly good movie uses fiction to teach truth in ways that leaves an audience stronger better and more enlightened and in all these measures Forrest Gump excels so completely as to have no equals in its job of putting 1960's life with disability in honest perspective.  My grandparents used to insist I never see myself as disabled I was expected to do everything the normal folk did and for years I thought my grandparents were cruel almost to the point of being sadistic.  I had started to know my grandparents loved me.  Watching Forrest Gump showed me that expecting your disabled child to make his own way in normal society coping using tools he developed alone was the most difficult way to love a special needs child in the 1960's but it was the only way to encourage success back in those days when ignorant hostile cruelty about disabilities was rampant.<br /><br />I am successful today exactly because my grandparents pushed me forcing me to cope in the world of normal people until I got it right.  In my case it took me 41 years to get it right and it is still a daily struggle to live among normal folk but I do it.  I had hated and avoided watching Forrest Gump for the same reasons I love and highly reccomend buying it from AMAZON.COM now.  The Forrest Gump experience as wacky and off beat as it appears was really how it was to be cognitively and physically disabled in the 1960's.  For a long time Forrest Gump was too real.  Forrest Gump's message hit me way too close to home reminding me of things I'd rather forget and for those very same reasons I most highly recommend that you please buy Forrest Gump on DVD from Amazon.com because the story might be fiction but the 1960's disabled experince it shares is so REAL it can not honestly be deniedtake it from one who lived it!  This I know.abilities was rampant. <br /> <br />I am successful today exactly because my grandparents pushed me forcing me to cope in the world of normal people until I got it right.

B000BO0LKY|4.0|I love all the songs on this platinum cd but they should have also included the two bonus songs that are included on the Japanese import cd (Sprung, Secret Love) which I previously purchased. Now right now \\"Don't Forget About Us\\" is #1 on the charts and if you bought the original cd, The Emancipation Of Mimi, it is not included on there. The Dvd with the 4 videos are wonderful but to access the video\\"Don't Forget About Us\\"   and the never before seen interview , you have to have something called DVD @ccess program which I have no knowledge of and apparently don't have or it is disabled. It would be great if I could readily view them just like the 4 other videos! I can not give this cd 5 stars because of this!
B00080ZG10|2.0|170 minutes long with the proverbial \\"cast of thousands\\", not to mention the lenghty list of credits, it's hard to imagine how much boredom can be accumulated in nearly 3 hours of screentime. 19 Executive Producers with Mr. DiCaprio on top and also the lone star shown above the title. We wind up with an avid display of the sccentricities of Howard Hughes and a superficial view of a 15 year chronolgy of his life during the 30's and 40's. So much effort went into his \\"Obsessive Compulsive Disorder\\" and Aviation that everything else takes a backstage drop. Mr. Hughes might have been a lunatic but his life was certainly not as dull as this film. <br />  Mr. DiCaprio is not acting as much as he is impersonating. Cate Blanchett, as Katherine Hephurn, is also doing a fine impersonation, but not acting. On the other hand Kate Beckinsdale does a terrific job as Ava Gardner both in portrayal and beauty. Alan Alda and Alec Baldwin turn in very notable performances that try to spark up the fimn. 3 actors, great Special Effects and Cinematography. That's it. Ther ain't no more. Even the Howard Shore soundtrack is totally silly. <br />  There is no doubt that mr. Scorcese is a brilliant director. sorry Martin. This one does'nt fly. The film literally lacks any cohesive direction with no definitive pointS. The final scene is not an ending but a reminder of what one just sat through. <br />  A few afterthoughts. <br />  Wilhem Dafoe. A great actor. It must have been a big gun at your head to cameo here. <br />  For comic relief 5 stars tO Ian Holm, as Professor Fitz, trying to scientifically explain the size and dimension of Jane Russel's breasts. Oh...i'm sorry, mammeries. <br />  If you rent the 2-disc DVD there are 3 hours of Special Features that are really worthwhile...really worthwhile...really worthwhile.
0800177177|1.0|In this horribly unessesary gory,graphic and violent film literally sucks. Granted, I watched one hour of it, but one hour was (literally) all I could stomach.I had to take a TUMS after seeing this movie.No kidding. Amongst the most disturbingly graphic and violent scenes is the one in which three vampire women devour a baby. Gary Oldman is interesting as as Count Dracula,but even he can't revive this horrible flop as a film.Keaneu Reeves' acting is a wooden as the stake that went through Dracula's heart. Winona Ryer is horribly miscast. The dialouge is horrible. This is one movie deserves to be buried, never again to arise.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|The mark of a great soundtrack is that it compliements the film expertly. That is the case with the Brokeback Mountain Soundtrack. Like the film, at first you may feel its \\"too slow\\" however, soon it creeps into your soul just like the film long after the campfire is out. Instead of one \\"big overblown  single\\" such as Titanic had with Celine Dion, this soundtrack instead chooses (wisely) to do more with less, and the result is a captivating collection of songs and score that take you back to the film and beyond. It is an outstanding achievement. A perfect compliment to the book, and the film.
0393035158|4.0|Ideas which divide one group of humans from another, only to unite them in slaughter, generally have their roots in religion. (Recent examples offered by Harris include Jews vs. Muslims in Palestine, Orthodox Serbs vs. Catholic Croats in the Balkans, Protestants vs. Catholics in Northern Ireland, Muslims vs. Hindus in Kashmir, Muslims vs. Christians in Nigeria, etc.) The central tenet of every religious belief is that all others are mere repositories of error. The bad news is that technology has now rendered religious differences dangerous to our survival.<br /><br />Prior examples of religious abuse of others include the Inquisition, the Holocaust (aided by Catholics in particular - per Harris); for some reason the Crusades were not listed by Harris.<br /><br />Conceptual revolutions are possible, notes Harris - eg. alchemy is no longer in favor, and faith-based religion must suffer the same slide into obsolescence.<br /><br />\\"The End of Faith\\" sees religious tolerance as one of the main forces driving us toward the abyss. Most believe good things come from faith - strong communities, ethical behavior, spiritual experience. Harris, however, believes that tolerance simply allows the faithful to run amok.<br /><br />Gallup polls show that 35% of the U.S. take the Bible literally as the inerrant word of the Creator, another 48% believe it is the \\"inspired\\" word of the Creator, and still inerrant, though some passages must be interpreted symbolically. Only 17% doubt the existence of God. Thus, about 230 million Americans believe a book with neither unity of style nor internal consistency was authored via an omniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent deity. (One gets the impression that Harris is not one of them.)<br /><br />It is undoubtedly a good thing that not everyone takes the Bible literally - even some of those who say they do. Deuteronomy calls for killing relatives embracing false gods. Thus, Harris concludes that religious moderation is simply unacknowledged neglect/ignorance of the letter of divine law.<br /><br />\\"Religion should be susceptible to progress through present inquiry, not merely reiteration of past doctrine\\" states Harris. It is the only area of thought that has not progressed over time.<br /><br />Muslim propensity to violence is a particular concern for Harris. Most Muslims who commit atrocities are explicit about a desire to get to paradise. As for family left behind, a Muslim martyr gets to pick 70 to join him/her in paradise. Many claim Islam is a religion of peace, citing what Harris calls a single line in the Koran that condemns suicide. However, Harris sees this as a single, ambiguous statement within other passages that are direct summons to war against \\"friends of Satan.\\" Further, the Koran states that \\"believers who stay at home . . . are not the equal of those who fight for the cause of God.\\" Finally, using bin Laden as the ultimate example (well-educated, high income), Harris points out that religious fundamentalism in the developing Muslim world is not principally a movement of the poor and uneducated - the implication being that economic development may not be the solution.<br /><br />The influence of religion in the West now seems rather benign vs. medieval Europe or today's Muslim world. Yet, it is widely reported that Reagan saw the Middle-East through the lens of biblical prophecy, and included Jerry Falwell and others in national security briefings. Christians support Israel, says Harris, because they believe final consolidation of Jewish power in the Holy Land will usher in the 2nd coming of Christ. Meanwhile, Roy Moore, confronted by the 6th highest murder rate in the nation, thought it expedient to install a 2.5 ton monument of the Ten Commandments in Alabama's state courthouse. (78% of those polled objected to its removal, and Congress passed an amendment to preclude federal funds being used to remove it.) Further, we have banned much stem cell research, prohibit overseas federal dollars to provide abortion information, and turn the capital upside down in the tragic Terri Shiavo case. And 40% of those voting for Bush are white evangelicals.<br /><br />A very interesting book, with a number of excellent points. However, he does overstate some issues (eg. WWI, WWII, the Cold War, Iraq I and II, and the Vietnam War had little, if anything to do with religion. Also moderate Christians, Jews, and Muslims are much more useful than Harris believes. Nonetheless, he adds key insights into Muslim and our own motivations, and the dangers inherent in both.rseas federal dollars to provide abortion information, and turn the capital upside down in the tragic Terri Shiavo case.

B000BKVQTS|3.0|Few complain when writers and directors take a fresh take on an old story: at times the new approach even enhances the original. Sadly, that is not the case with THE BROTHERS GRIMM.  Though Terry Gilliam is well recognized as one who makes magic out of old things retold, this time the magic seems to have been concentrated on costumes, weird head pieces, claustrophobic haunted villages, and animated effects. As a result the story is left behind and without a decent script, leaves little for the actors to mold into anything.<br /><br />This telling of the Brothers Grimm is more grim than fantastical.  Instead of fairytale writers, these misanthropes are snake oil salesmen out to purge villages of their demons (all a part of show that pays them well).  Matt Damon and Heath Ledger are the wily two and try their best to make the story happen. Interspersed in the derring-do are snippets of the fairytales that came from the imagination of the brothers and they serve as sidebars of some interest, albeit distorted versions, intensely altered versions of Hansel and Gretel, Little Red Ridinghood, etc.<br /><br />There is a reason this film took so long to make and ran up high production costs: the production company was trying to make it work and failed.  Mildly entertaining but hardly worth the long hours it seems to take to tell it.  Grady Harp, December 05
B00005UEAR|5.0|This album is for me the best from DT because you have everything in it. On the first CD you have solid, standard but still new and great DT music. On the second one you have a DT 42 minuite masterpiece. With this double CD you can really say that you have a value for money. \\"The glass prison\\" is a heavy song with great solos and full of progressive elements. \\"Blind faith\\" is a song that starts calmly but eventually builds up on great intensity in the middle with a great keyboard part. \\"Missunderstood\\" is a preety slow song which has a great dramatic prelude to the chorus. \\"The great debate\\" is a little bit less interesting than the previous songs.\\"Dissapear\\" is a nice ballad but with a little bit strange beginning.Than the masterpiece called \\"Six degrees of inner turbulence\\". As the title says this song is about diffrent people feeling that \\"inner turbulence\\" that we all human beeings feel in our life. The song starts off with the part called \\"Overture\\" which is an example of the keyboarders great musical skills, in this part especially in classical music.The songs ends with an incredible part called \\"Losing time/Grand finale\\" which is so dramatic and emotional that you just must cry at the end. So all i can say is: Buy this Album!
B00008EY65|5.0|I can't wait for the sequel. It's films like this that keep Comic-book films going!
B00005JNBQ|4.0|This show reminds me a lot of Blair Witch in that you either love it or hate it. I personally loved it, it is charming, sweet, painful, funny and oh so human.  Perhaps it is more of a show for people who like observing human behavior.<br /><br />And someone mentioned Ebert, I personally disagree with most of what he thinks...I like Roeper much better :)
B0002IQNAG|5.0|I remembering when I saw this movie for the first time, it was about ten years ago.  I can recall thinking \\"This is the \\"B\\"est movie I have ever seen\\".  I can remember laughing out loud and couldn't believe how wild the movie was.  However, I did find myself getting a hold of a copy on VHS.  Then a few years later, I bought the film on DVD.  The more I watched the movie, the more I began to develop an appreciation of how this movie was created.<br /><br />George Romero had to wait until this mall was closed, so he could shoot his movie in the evening.  Then once all the production was done, the crew would have to clean up so the mall could be used again for business hours.  Then once the mall would close, the process would begin all over.<br /><br />Another element I do like about this movie is the characters of Peter and Roger.  I love the way these two guys play off one and other.  I feel this is the main reason why I give a damn when I watch this movie.  Another funny aspect of this movie is the bootleg zombies.  For instance, there are scenes where certain zombies resemble celebrities.  Such as Jim Carey, Brad Pitt, Richard Pryor, and Trent Reznor (this only listing a few).  I must also add, one must watch this movie a million times to catch them.  In addition, they need to watch the director's cut to see all of them as well.<br /><br />Anchor Bay has done an amazing job with this release.  Three versions of the movie, plenty of documentaries and tons of extras.  The picture and sound quality are great.  The original Dawn of the Dead, is probably the best zombie movie of all time.  Yes, Romero's Night of the Living Dead is a classic, but there is just something about Dawn of the Dead.  Perhaps it is the characters or the under lying social aspects the film displays.<br /><br />Nevertheless, if one is interested in getting this movie on DVD, then one must pick up the Ultimate Edition.
B000021XS0|4.0|Some people say that this a genius album but to me it's just a good one. This album is a concept album which means that there is a main lyrical story throughout the album. This may be a good point although you have to be interested in reading lyrics to fully appreciate it. Every song in this album seems to be a logical continuation of the previous one which gives the album a preety special feeling.For you to decide if it's good or not. The album has especially a great beginning and a great ending which is a result of the underlying musical and lyrical concept. Apart from that there is a great ballad on this album - \\"The spirit carries on\\". This is a song really for everybody, it has especially gret lyrics that concern us all, namely the very old question of humanity about life after death, which ends on a hopeful note. There is also a song with grat variety, sometimes heavy, sometimes calm - \\"Through my words/Fatal tragedy\\". Overall i can say that this album is worth a listen.
B00005JMJG|5.0|This is an examination of a relationship--the highs and the lows, the good memories you'd give anything to keep, the on-going nagging issues, the misunderstandings.  In addition to being a romance, Eternal Sunshine is also a mystery, because Carrey needs to figure out who was behind his girlfriend Clementine's memory erasure, and he needs to figure out how to survive on his own.<br /><br />The movie is a lot easier to follow than the previews let on.  The portrayal of Carrey's inner memory map, and how memories converge into one another, was beautiful.  The filmmakers are to be admired for capturing the concept so well on screen.  Pick this one up if you want a nice break from the usual romantic comedy fare.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|I have already reviewed the original release of \\"The emancipation of mimi\\" so i will post that review, along with a review of the extra songs and dvd.  Mariah has done it again with The emancipation of mimi (Ultra platinum edition\\" She has generously given fans new songs, and all the videos from the album in one package!      It's Like That-A fast, up-tempo club song, good vocals on Mariah's part, and the end with fatman scoop is definetly the highlight of the song! The beat is perfect for dancing, definetly one of her best up-tempos! this was the 1st single from the album. Grade:A+     We belong Together-EVERYONE has heard this one! Beginning with a piano intro, We belong together is one of THE most succsessful singles of the year! The beat is very mid-tempo R&B, and its relaxing. Mariah's voice is suberb, especially her belting at the end! The song is about breaking up with your lover, and wanting them back. This was the 2nd single. Grade:A+     Shake it off-A mid-tempo R&B song, \\"Shake it off\\" is another breakup song, the song has a beat very similar to ushers \\"confessions part II\\" she even sings in a vein similar to usher! Vocal wise, the song is whispery until the end, but she belts it out in the end. I like the bridge, \\"I gotta shake shake shake it off\\" This was the third single. GRADE A+     Mine Again- A slow, R&B ballad. It begins with a slow 70's style keyboard, with mariah coming in soon after. During the chorus, she BELTS it out. And the song as a whole has a very 70's feel. I love the flutes in the background, so catchy. The song does lack a good ending though, it kinda just ends all too suddenly. Grade:B     Say somethin'-A fast, neptunes produced club song. Mariah sounds almost drunk during the berses, and the lyrics are crazy, (references to stars and planets, etc) but the chorus is simply infectious, and the snoop dogg rap fits in with the song perfectly. DEFINTETLY single material. Grade:A     Stay The night- This kanye west produced anthem samplesan old song named \\"betcha by golly wow\\" And it has a very old school, Jackson five-ish feel. Mariah wonders whether to sleep with someone she had recently broken up with after he asks her to. The song has a LOT of belting and i like the end where she belts out \\"STAAAY\\" and background vocals start. Pure perfection! Grade:A     Get your number- A Jermaine Dupri production, the song samples \\"Just my imagination\\" by a group called illusion. The song has a differen't song structure, Jermaine dupri sings the chorus, and Mariah does the the verses, the beat almost makes one think of Mariah's earlier song \\"Fantasy\\" The highlight of the song happens to be Mimi's two 10 second raps, in which she tells of her \\"pimp penthouse\\" and her \\"House in capri\\" This was the 4th single in europe. Grade: A+     One and only- A very downbeat, slick, R&B song, \\"One and only\\" features a rap by world famous rapper Twista, and is about a cheating man, and how mimi hopes to find her \\"one and only\\" Mariah actually sings VERY fast, like twista, the chorus is a little boring however, could have been better! Grade:B-     Circles- A slow old school mariah song, its about how she is going around in circles over her man. the production is slow, but good. I love the mariah high note at the end! pure fabulousness! The whole song is a excellent, and the ending is great, good climax! Grade:A     Your Girl-The song begins with a spanish guitar, and it has a very up-beat feel. Its short, and she really belts out the chorus! It is about wanting to be with someone. What else can i say, a true album highlight!     I wish you knew-This song has a fake \\"live\\" audience in it, but it fits in the song. The chorus is nice and easy to sing, and I love the spoken word part in the middle, very nice. The osng has a lot of nice background vocals in he beginning and end. Its one of the slower songs, and its a happy song. Grade:A     To the floor- The fastest song on the second half of the record, this is a duet with nelly, and it was produced by the neptunes. The beat is very fast, and the bass is loud, perfect for the clubs. The vocals by both are whispery, and hard to hear, but it doesnt degrade the song. Grade: A     Joy ride- Perfect for lounging around, Joy ride's beat is slow, and puts one in a hypnotic state. The vocals are nice and loud, and the verses are sung in an almost nursery rhyme like way. The chorus has more background singers than mariah's voice, but its still a treat. Grade: B+     Fly like a bird- A gospel song, it is very jazzy, and her pastor makes a cameo! At first, mariah's voice is flat, but as the song goes on, it gets louder and stronger, until the climax, with Mariah belting out the chorus many times, along with a choir chanting behind her. Its probably my favorite song on the record, it is inspiring, fun, and a perfect song in every sense of the word. Grade: A+     Don't forget about us-A wonderful, beautiful ballad. It is sort of a We belong together part II! Except it has a more R&B beat, and I think better vocals. The chorus is easy to sing along with, and the lyrics are about ending a relationship. I love her vocals at the end! She REALLY belts it out! This is her 17th number one single!!! Grade:A+    Makin' it last all night (What it do)- A great club song, the rap from JD is grand! It starts with a slow beat, but it builds up. Mariah shows good vocals on the track, and its really nice for gettign ready to go out to the club. Grade: A+    So lonely (One and only part II)-An up-tempo hip hop song. Twista does the verses, and mariah does the rap and bridge. I personally wish Mariah did more on the song, but her parts are simply infectious. She sings in a whispy voice, and sings about wanting a man and not being lonely anymore. It is a great track! Grade:A+    We belong together (hip hop remix featuring Jadakiss and styles P.)- A faster version of we belong together, but it is not fast enough to be considered up-tempo. The beat is that of the originals, but sped up, and there is more of a hip hop feel. Mariah chose to re-sing the vocals from the original! I love her rap singing. It is REALLY fast! This may not be as good as the original, but it comes close.            The DVD features all the videos from the album so far, and each is a visual treat. It also features a 25 minute long interview, and a link to the \\"Don't forget about us\\" video. Mariah recently stated that she plans on adding more links to the dvd in the future, so keep popping it in your computer!    Overall, The emancipation of mimi (ultra platinum edition) is the best record of 2005, and definetly deserving of all the awards it has recently recieved!    PS: Please do not listen to the negative reviews, they come from jealous madonna fans, who will stop at NOTHING to bring down Mariah, probably because their queens latest album sucks. I am a huge madonna fan, and i am disgusted by their behavior. I hated \\"Confessions on a dance floor\\" but madonna is still one of my faves! The 1 star reviews are only from jealous, hateful people with too much itme on their hands. I know they will rate my review as a \\"no\\" but i hope atleast one person finds this review helpful.

B0009A1AS2|4.0|At first i thought this album was better than \\"Train of thought\\" but now i think that they are just diffrent. \\"Train of thought\\" had an intense overall atmosphere while this one has a more diffrentiated sound.\\"The root of all evil\\" is a very good song, it's quite heavy, has a great main riff and you can easily compare it to their song \\"The glass prison\\" from their SDOIT album. \\"The answer lies within\\" is a great ballad but some people don't seem to like it.All i can say is that if you like other DT's ballads you shouldn't be dissapointed with this one. \\"These walls\\" has a good start and a great ending but the chorus part isn't very good.\\"I walk beside you\\" is another great song. I don't understand why some people say this song is more mainstream and therefore less good.Just that the song has a more easy structure doesen't mean that it doesen't have great quality.\\"Panick attack\\" is the heaviest song of the album. \\"Never enough\\" is a pretty strange song with a strange atmosphere. For me it's the only bad song on the album.\\"Sacrificed sons\\" is a song that starts slowly but builds up on intensity in the middle part.Pretty good. \\"Octavarium is the last song of the album. Overall it's a pretty calm song.To some it may sound great but to others the song may be a little bit boring. So, if you are a DT fan you will surely find something interesting in this album, if you are new to the band, it's a preety good album to get started with.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I won't take up alot of space raving about the film. So many others have done that pretty well here. I'll just say that the film captures the loneliness of Wyoming perfectly then perfectly transposes it to the lives of the characters.  Ang Lee just has to win the academy award for this one thing alone. Masterpeice is not too strong a word.<br /><br />The one point that the film makes, and I think has been lost in all the \\"gay hoopla\\", is the collateral damage in the lives of the people forced to live as someone they are not. Look at the families of the two lead characters.  Both suffered immeasurably because of the lie their husbands/fathers were forced to live. I would tell the religious right and anyone who wants gay people to fake their lives by pretending to be straight to consider the others in the equation. Even if you can never understand homosexuality yourself have some feelings for the people who will spend their lives confused and hurt, perhaps never understanding why their spouse/father is so emotionally unavailable to them.<br /><br />Days after seeing this film it still resonates with me.  Go see this film.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Spielberg's masterpiece ranks among the greatest films ever made about the Holocaust during World War II. It's a film about heroism with an unlikely hero at its center who risked his life and went bankrupt to save more than 1,000 Jews from certain death in concentration camps. No way you will see a better movie about this dark period of our world. Great acting, great photography. If you want to own only 1 movie about the holocaust during world war II. This is the one. If You wish to see great movies from the same period, I would recommend:<br />1. Das Boot<br />2. Downfall<br />3. Band of brothers
0060899190|5.0|I've been reading the website every Sunday for months, so of course this was on my Christmas list. Yeah, I had seen a lot of the secrets before, but they were from weeks long ago, and I liked seeing them again. I liked the foreword and the intro pages, and I love the format of the secrets. They really stood out on the pages and looked so vivid and interesting. I also like the quotes scattered between the pages.. definitely worth the money, even if you've seen some of the secrets before.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|I stumbled onto Firefly in a meander on the edge of the black looking for interesting Sci-Fi entertainment awhile ago.  Needless to say, the series was captivating and satisfying on every level.  I was sad to realize there would be no more episodic contributions, but had hopes for a feature film.  When Serenity was finally made and released in theaters, I was there on opening day.  I just fell back into the Whedon-Reality, without missing a beat in the action, humour, and heart of the characters and their story.  This movie brings on the action six-shooter style and never lets up. The quick wit and unique dialogue with the multi-cultural mix is there blazoning your brain with its cleverness - making you wish you could work words with such saucy deliveries.  The movie is the perfect accompaniment to the series.  Hopefully, there will be enough interest in the DVD and increased interest in Firefly that Whedon's (and our dream) will come true and allow more adventures of Mal and crew!  Don't miss this excellent opportunity to be entertained!

I have never found anyone who can top Herriott for combining humor, pathos, character study and warmth in the \\"animal\\" genre. . This is a book that will delight people of all ages forever. I'm sure Herriott has been the inspiration for many a veterinarian career. Every one of his books maintains the same consistently top-notch writing. A great holiday, birthday, anniversary, or any other occasion gift. I think I'll go back and read this book again right now!!
B000AOEMXM|5.0|If you are into Star Trek, you will agree that this is their best show ever. Unfortunately they are only 4 seasons. The stories are most the time excellent and will keep you and all your family stuck next the TV screen for many many days. The quality of the DVD's picture and sound is by far better than any other previous Star Trek release on DVD, so if you are only buying 1 star trek complete series, this one is the best in all aspects; guaranteed. enjoy
B00005JO1Y|2.0|This film is over three hours long.  It takes an hour and ten minutes to see the monkey.  The CGI effects are good, but not perfect; in particular the recreation of Depression-era Manhattan has a digitalized patina, and the multifarious dinosaurs look a little toy-like - Kong, however, is very well done.  The story makes very little sense, certainly no more than in the original movie, and no attempt is made to make it coherent - one can only assume that its logic is meant to be that of a dream.  Unfortunately, listening to someone recount their dreams is notoriously tedious, and so it is here.  Natives appear and disappear, brontosauruses and leeches come and go, and Kong brushes off tyranosaurus rexes and bullets galore but succumbs to a spear in the leg and a bottle of ether; the crew of the ship is seemingly infinite, providing bloody cannon-fodder, and while their navigational skills seem impaired on the outward journey, homeward bound they contrive to save not just themselves but Kong as well; aeroplanes fly sufficiently close to Kong for him to grasp them from the sky, and Naomi Watts is fabulously free of a fear of heights.  Of course, a dream leaves little room for character development and the humans all remain much less human than the ape. With no sympathetic human character to empathize with the film becomes boring.  Perhaps if Naomi Watts fattened herself up a little and found a better line of amusing small talk then things would have been all right.  As it was, I was rooting for the ape and, as we all know, he didn't do so well, so only two stars.
B000065U1N|5.0|Hollywood succeeded in showing a recreation of the real story of the Somalian city of Mogadishu in October 1993, where American troops were ordered to capture a key Samalian Warlord Called Mohammad Farrah Adid. A 45-minute mission turned into a 16-hour ordeal of bloody urban war.<br /><br />If you like action or drama movies, combined with real history here you have it all. The quality of DVD and sound is great not to mention the acting and photography they are even better. Highly recommended if you like this genre.
1400077915|5.0|<br />If you have not read Alice Munro, how I envy you. You have so much pleasure ahead of you. She writes for us about wonder- the wonder of everyday life; the small things; the touching things; the things that make you say, yes, this is the human heart; all of these are her fictional world, much as they are our pasts, and our presents. This is a strong collection and an excellent place to get to know what she is about. After this, explore her backlist. My personal favorite besides this is an early collection called,The Moons of Jupiter, which is still in print in a nice paperbak format. I hope you enjoy discovering her as much as I have.  <br />
6304698526|3.0|This is considered a classic thriller. I watched this movie when I was a kid and I loved it.<br />Watching it again some 30 years later, I found it very slow and the car chase is just a minor plus in this movie. I watched all this movie simply because it is a classic however the story including the sound effects and picture of the DVD are simply very basic and not worth spending the money. Rent it first, and see if it is worth buying.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Beauty and the Beast has always been my favorite fairy tale. I have been enthralled by this movie for close to 15 years now and never get tired of seeing it. Being a fairy tale enthusiast, I don't mind the changes they made. In the original tale, the villains are her family, who try to keep her from going back to the dying beast. Conceited and rude Gaston was a perfect foil against the endearing and kind Beast. The objects were given a much bigger role, but the characterization was solid and the story fit them in very well. Oh, and for a previous poster who mentioned the Disney happy ending-the original fairy tale has her arriving before he dies and telling him she loves him, thus setting him free and giving them a happily ever after. The Disney version is amazingly accurate to the story, also seeing as it was originally a French fairy tale, and I've always felt it was a more than adequate translation of one of the best fairy tales and love stories ever written.
0805066691|5.0|This is a superb book on so many levels.  I recently bought it for my Israeli born girlfriend, who has a refreshingly keen interest in American history, and who approaches it with a relatively blank mental canvas.  We've had some heated exchanges over the topic of the whole Middle East conflict, and the strife between Israel and the Palestinians, and this is a wonderfully seditious gem of a book in that it drives home the point so wonderfully that every country has its orthodox view of its own history, yet almost always there is another way of looking at that history which is just as valid, and which chronicles the events equally truthfully...just from the perspective of \\"the other side.\\" <br /> <br />Try reading this book and keep in mind that virtually any history can be told the same way.  It will open your eyes and mind to many other histories of cultural/ethnic/political conflicts around the world. <br /> <br />But I found this book, upon rereading it, especially conduscive to parallels with what has been going on in the Middle East for the past 50 years.  The history of distrust, demonization of one's opponents, treaties made and broken, allegations that neither party's word could be trusted because, invariably, some individual or small group of individuals would act in a way that violated promises made by those who, in reality, had no true authority to speak for everyone they pretended to represent, hadn't the police or military apparatus to effectively enforce those promises, and were ultimately held responsible when somebody else acted in a way that violated those promises. <br /> <br />Does this sound familiar when you think of the never-ended discord and cycle of violence between Israel and the Palestinians?    Palestinian militants who act with disregard for promises made by PA leaders, just as \\"renegade Indians\\" would do so with respect to agreements made by various Chiefs who had negotiated peace deals with American generals...Israeli settlers whose visceral distrust of Palestinian neighbors and intransigence with respect to efforts to negotiate a peace lead them to commit acts of violence, which their government officially condemns but quietly abides.     How about Ireland in the past few hundred years?  It is the same history of cultural conflict that Dee Brown writes about in this book. <br /> <br />The beauty of this book is in the story telling, the version of truth that it offers, the sadness of the history itself, and the realization that the history that ends up becoming the orthodox version of events does so, ultimately, not because it's description of events is more objective or factual, but because it is the perspective of the victorious.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|With a facinating mix of influences and writing that moves seamlessly from humor to drama to action,  this is one of the best stories in current SciFi.  Serenity, by itself, is a very good movie, but the real value comes from immersing yourself in the \\"Firefly\\" universe.  I saw Serenity first, then the firefly DVDs, and then Serenity again.  This was a great intro to the franchise.  Highly recommended!
B00005LOUQ|4.0|I saw this movie in theaters and I did not know what to think of it. The cinematography and the sets were absolutely amazing, and the two dimensional world of Dr. Seuss so effectively brought to life visually was stunning. <br /> <br />But despite the beauty of the setting, there are a few details that do muddle this movie. Although Jim Carrey as the Grinch is outrageously funny (The presents! They'll all be destroyed! AND I CARE! What's the Deal?) some of the humor goes a bit too far and eventually stops being funny. Had Ron Howard used restraint on the crudeness and pushed the emotion and story forward a bit, you would have a wonderful heart-warming retelling of the classic story that does have a few hilarious moments that are truly hilarious and not crude or stupid.
0316153834|4.0|This is the third of the Harry Bosch detective mysteries and the best of the first three. THE CONCRETE BLONDE pits Bosch against a barracuda trial attorney in a skirt sueing him for killing the wrong man. Bosch thought he had nailed a serial killer but the same type of killings continue. His back against the wall, Bosch tries to determine if he did indeed shoot the wrong man or if there is a copycat. The reader is treated again to Mr. Connelly's trademark dialogue, which is so taut it snaps like a whip across the page. There is little wasted wordage in a Bosch novel; you get in the car and drive friom the first sentence. The plot is as twisted as the roads around Los Angeles and as decadent as the city itself, but the discerning reader has plenty of clues to solve the riddle before Bosch. Bosch's relationship with his girlfriend is explored in some depth as the character of Bosch is more fully revealed with each book. A hard-boiled, no-nonsense detective-knight who steers by his own morale compass through the political bureaucracy of the LAPD, Bosch is immensely fun to cheer for from our armchairs in an often confusing and sometimes dark world. I am reading the Bosch novels in sequence and I look forward next to THE LAST COYOTE  because I think Michael Connelly is getting better with each book. Now isn't that something?
B000B8QEYC|4.0|One can understand the criticisms of this current release. The songs sound the same as those on her past few CDs, and yet they are different enough to stand alone as new pieces. Go figure! But that is the beauty of Enya... familiar yet different. I loved \\"if I could be where you are\\" and \\"long long journey\\". And who else would name a song and album something as beautiful sounding as the word Amarantine? <br /> <br />Enjoy this CD for what it is... orchestral, layered, choral pieces with the haunting vocals of an artist that conjures up all sorts of images and feelings in the listener's mind and heart. What else can you ask for from Enya... <br /> <br />
B000AY3KN0|5.0|amazing movie, amazing DVD. The Spider Pit- Jackson segment brought about a fun historical-archaeological film moment for me. It was done by fans for fans. This is an amazing quality DVD set for a truly amazing break through film.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This was a pretty damn good ending to an overlooked series.Some questions were answered and some remain,only the dvd sales will determine whether the franchise continues.And don't listen to the Star Wars dweebs trashing this movie,captain Reynolds might vaguely resemble Han Solo,but I don't see any Chewbaccas or big blue head aliens!Just jealously because the Star Wars prequels are nothing but special effects showcases with wooden characters no one could possibly care about!
0446577383|4.0|The author exercises considerable literary license in his portrayal of the Washington government/security types as being hypercapable types who are so efficient that they can walk on water and then some.  I have lived in the Wash DC area for forty-one years and worked for the federal government as an attorney for a little over thirty of those years.  What he says ain't so! <br /> <br />The bureaucracy's prime area of expertise lies in the expenditure of vast amounts of money and not being held accountable for it.  And the Homeland Security department is one of the prime examples. <br /> <br />Baldacci does, however, know the geography and landmarks of the DC area quite well and this adds somewhat to the book's appeal for those who live in the metro area where the action takes place. (maybe this is what they called damning something with faint praise)
B0000AQS0F|5.0|But when I bought the dvd boxed set I absolutely cussed out Fox for cancelling this original sci fi concept before it could find an audience,which it did given the Serenity movie,even though the nincompoops at Fox put it in the 8pm Friday night slot,when the young audience that would get this show would be out and about!People forget that the thing that made the original Star Trek a success(in syndication) was the character interaction between Kirk/Spock/Bones. A show with awful special effects(now anyway)is still popular because it was character driven.Well I've seen them all and I'm here to tell you no sci fi show ever made is more character driven than Firefly!High tech mixed with low tech with a touch of the old west and Chinese influence thrown in with a cast of former soldiers,a high class hooker,a funny ace pilot,a cute cheerful tomboy ship mechanic,a violent mercenary,a priest with a past,and a brother and sister on the run from a totalitarian regime dominating the verse,a true dysfunctional family in space.Gritty and character driven,Firefly is like no sci fi series ever made!
B0009QTS1M|5.0|I wasn't expecting much when I bought this DVD. I hadn't read any reviews or content lists. I just bought it for the 17 minutes of extra footage, but this release is so much more than just that! <br /> <br />The extra footage in itself is fantastic. Some dialogue is repititive, but it draws out the story and make the intentions of the characters much clearer. Also while some of the footage was in the earlier DVD release's deleted scenes section, putting it into the movie gives it much more perspective than can be provided by watching single scenes by themselves. Overall, it's fantastic addition to the already stellar theatrical release. <br /> <br />Disc 2 has a a mammoth 200 minute documentary that delves into just about every aspect of the production, answers questions and doesn't just offer a glossy TV view; you actually hear the personal opinions of the people involved without any censors. You hear about the writers' dissapointment with story changes, the producers talking about getting Ridley, their reactions to the death of Oliver Reed, etc. <br /> <br />Disc 3 features some additional deleted scenes, storyboards, massive production photo albums and other nifty things that a viewer can sift through. <br /> <br />To sum up: Just the extra scenes more than make up for the money spent on this set, however Ridley doesn't stop there. The rest of the additional content is absolutely stunning and makes this a must-buy for all fans of the movie.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|I must be missing something-  this is the product review for the BOXED SET- right?  Not the individual discs?  It seems like people are more concerned with having bought the ind. discs than REVIEWING this product.  Have you not noticed how we love our \\"stuff\\" here in the states?  EVERY movie comes out on DVD.  Then that christmas they come out with the SAME movie but in the criterion collection...AND WE BUY IT.  EVERY series comes out in individual first- THEN comes out in a set.  AND WE BUY IT.  Long live corporate greed & rampant consumerism- if we didnt buy the single ones- they wouldnt make them......   <br /> <br />If the single ones cost so much-and you're desperate to buy this one- why not consider selling them on amazon or ebay- and using the proceeds to buy this one? Getting mad at the fat cats at HBO wont do you any good- just gives you high blood pressure....;)   <br /> <br />That said- for those of you looking at this with a sincere interest in buying it- its a great deal.  If you are a fan who didnt buy the single discs- this is the way to do it.
0618526412|5.0|Oprah put The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter on her book club list and it's been selling well as a Golden Oldie, but don't be put off by Oprah's middlebrow fans, Carson McCullers was a genius.      At age twenty-two McCullers arrives in New York City with a manuscript so insightful into human pathos, you would think she knew Freud and Aristotle on a first name basis.  The book made a sensation from the beginning.  Certainly Richard Wright thought that it was the first book by a Southern white person that had any insight and feelings for the plight of Negroes.  Indeed, her characterizations of black poor people crashed barriers with ease.  Her characterizations of Mick Kelly's family and other white citizens of a mythological Faulknarian hamlet are no less well drawn.    Lonely doesn't have a plot.  The reader shares the thoughts and overhears the conversations of five characters, Mick, McCuller's teen alter-ego, Doctor Copeland the only black doctor for a thousand miles raging with hatred for white men and his own race, Mr. Brannon, a caf owner with a suddenly dead wife and a semi-unhealthy obsession about young Mick, Jake Blount a Marxist revolutionary, roustabout, and Singer the deaf mute.    It is Singer that brings these diverse characters together for he is their father confessor, but that's a laugh for the reader; Singer can't hear them.  They go on and on about their lives, their dreams and disappointments, but Singer merely nods his head agreeably.  The mute becomes a kind of town guru, a Buddha.  He has a following of folks that think he has mystical powers or great intellect.  In reality, Singer is a nice man, but he loves only one person, and that man is in a mental hospital.    This book is very influential.  Southern American writers have some kind of catharsis in youth that's a leg up for a fiction writer.  After all, life is surreal enough if you examine a life, any life.
B0000B1OFL|5.0|Forget the old Italian Job, that has little to do with it.  This movie is all about the action and mini coupes.  Mark Walhberg, Edward Norton, and many others as master theives.  Charlize Theron is the eye candy of the movie so there's someone for the guys to stare at, lol.  It's just so thrilling to see them in action pulling off very complicated heists.  The mini coupes are used a lot in this movie and are quite cool cars that seem to get the job done in the Italian job.  It has drama, comedy, suspense and romance.  Everything you'd like to have in a flick.  So I give this movie a full 5 stars because I love to watch it over and over.  I can't think of one bad thing to say about it.  It's even at a bit of a bargain price!  So grab a copy and you won't be disappointed.
B000AJJNPY|4.0|Title says it all.
B000002UAU|2.0|Compared to most other Beatles albums, this album now sounds dated and does not show the Beatles at their best or most creative. I have to say it is one of my least favourite Beatles albums, and I would urge anyone not to make this their first purchase, try Rubber Soul or A Hard Day's Night instead. <br /> <br />Lucy In The Sky is a decent enough pop song, Fixing a Hole is quite good, but there's little else here of note. It's a bit of a sloppy album, and the Pepper concept is a little pathetic. <br /> <br />I'll get shot down in flames for stating these opinions I'm sure, but I stand by them, it's a heavily over-rated album. Ask a room full of Beatles fans what their favourite Beatles album is, and very few would say Pepper.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|It has been years since I've purchased an album that has consumed me like \\"Confessions\\" has.  While I'm enough of a Madonna fan to own every full-length album she's released (except for soundtracks, remix albums, etc.), I don't think any of her albums have really hooked me as much as this one has. <br /> <br />That's not to say it's her \\"best\\" from an artistic standpoint, but it's really a very clever album, full of well-chosen samples from other artists, as well as sly nods to her own hits from the past. <br /> <br />The album has an infectious energy, and truly does not have any filler. <br /> <br />Singles and remixes should be ruling the dance floors and clubs for the forseeable future.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|Success is not without its fair share of pitfalls as perennial cult-favorite Joss Whedon knows all too well. Following the fruition of his horror/drama television series on the WB network, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and its eventual spin-off, Angel, Whedon set to work on a new drama for FOX entitled Firefly, a science-fiction series blended with a nostalgic western style to its storylines. The series however was doomed to fail from the very beginning. Although it did manage to successfully recruit a loyal fan base during its short run in the United States, a group which would more commonly be referred to later on as the Brown Coats, low ratings led executives at the FOX television network to cancel the show after only eleven episodes. Reasons for its early cancellation are attributed to its late-Friday evening timeslot, in which it was often preempted by sporting events, FOX's inability to properly promote the program as a character-based drama, and the airing of the series' episodes out of chronological order. Fans of the program quickly assembled the Firefly Immediate Assistance Campaign to revive the series, perhaps on another network, but were unable to do so. However, the remarkable profitability of the complete series' DVD sales prompted series creator Joss Whedon to team-up with Universal Pictures to spawn a full-length feature film based on the now-defunct series entitled Serenity in an effort to revive the once thought dead cult-classic. <br /> <br />The story for Serenity is truly one of the most originative and flat-out awe-inspiring scripts to grace domestic movie theatres with its presence in the last few years, let alone this year. The dialogue is especially crisp and brilliantly crafted with each of the characters and their actions onscreen. At first glance the specific word usage would conceivably fall flat in regards to the demographic with which the feature film is aimed toward, this being young adults, but surprisingly it never once feels out of place or awkwardly constructed. Instead it flows genially throughout the picture. The one downside it has however is the amount of confusion the film may cause for those unfamiliar with the now-defunct television series, Firefly, which now appears in a DVD box set. This is not necessarily the fault of series creator Joss Whedon who took it upon himself to attempt the daunting task of having to balance within his own script - (a) a certain proportion of the viewing audience which needs to be brought up to date, at the very least minimally, on the individual character storylines and (b) appealing to the loyal following of Browncoats, the nickname given to fans of the short-lives series, without pissing off or demeaning either side off. That being said, it is not recommended that anyone unfamiliar with the series go into this film without at least some basic concept as to what the characters are all about. This would go so far as to suggest watching a few episodes of Firefly now playing on the Sci-Fi television network or renting the series on DVD and taking in a few episodes before viewing the movie. <br /> <br />Many, if not all, of the recurring characters of the Firefly television series return to their respective role in the feature film adaptation. While their performances are pretty much the same as they were on the small screen, not a complaint in the least, each performer seems to take their role up a notch in the transition to the silver screen. Nathan Fillion is one of the major stars of the picture and the one likely to benefit the most from Serenity's critical acclaim. Comparisons to Star Wars' Han Solo are expected to be made toward Fillion's Captain Malcolm Reynolds whose `shoot first, ask questions later' attitude often gets him over his head. Chiwetel Ejiofor is the perfect adversary to Captain Malcolm Reynolds, an avowed atheist, in the role of The Operative simply because unlike Reynolds he believes adamantly in what he is fighting for. Surprisingly heis not the villain audiences might expect. He is perfectly admirable, relinquishing his `sword' so to speak at the end when the cause he has fought valiantly for has been defeated. It is only his cause that is immoral but because he believes in it, again, unlike Reynolds, we have to respect him for it. And Summer Glau is wonderful in the role of River Tam. There are moments, in particular a scene in which the crew returns from a heist and she delivers the line, \\"I swallowed a bug\\", where she is perfectly adorable. Then you have scenes, especially near the end of the film, in which she able to show off her action skills. Hopefully she will have more opportunities to work in feature films thanks to this film. <br /> <br />Overall, Serenity, whether it is viewed by certified Brown Coats or green horns, is an innovative motion-picture event, a true rarity in a year overflowing with lifeless big-budget action flicks and extraneous sequels, with something for nearly everyone, from breathtaking special effects and solid performances to splashes of well-timed dark humor and inspiration religious message every audience member no matter what their religious affiliation can take to heart. Series creator and film director Joss Whedon, a man quite familiar with using theological subtexts within his works, designed Serenity specifically as a means in which to answer the question his now-defunct science-fiction series attempted to ask. The driving force behind the power of belief is that we as human beings conceptualize of a greater power in the universe, greater then ourselves, which controls every aspect of our lives down to our very actions. We however still retain the ability to decide for ourselves whether we should follow the right or the wrong path in life and the level at which we are willing, or unwilling, to give up a part of ourselves to a higher purpose in life will help us in making that decision. Serenity does not pull for one particular faith over another. AlthoughShepard Book is Christian, audiences would only know of this if they were to watch the television series. However, atheism, a concept to which Captain Malcolm Reynolds applies himself toward for a majority of the picture, is strongly condemned in the film. Mal has a moral code but because he does not belief in anything, let alone God, he can not comprehend what it fully means. This causes him to do stupid thing and risk the safety of his crew as he does. According to Serenity, it does not matter what religion we affiliate ourselves with as long as we believe in something. It may be a tad nave to say the least but, on the other hand, it isn't preachy with its message which is often hard to find, especially in Hollywood. The Joss Whedon helmed picture does have other things besides a motivating message going for it. As low-budget as this action adventure is, roughly thirty-nine million dollars according to studio estimates, the special effects, in particular the stunning aerial acrobatic chase sequence near the end of the film, are positively stunning. Furthermore, Serenity's musical score, a wonderful blending of nostalgic western ballads and mysterious futuristic accompaniments, is brilliantly composed by David Newman. Serenity benefits substantially from a brilliantly witty and charming script from series creator Joss Whedon. Its effective combination of humor, action, and heart make it a must see for any fan of science-fiction, whether they be Trekies or Jedis in training, or movies in general.
0307276902|1.0|This was the most boring book i have ever read.  I bought it 2 months ago and still haven't finished it. I initially purchased it becase of all the hype on Oprah's show.  Never again will I buy a book that she recommends.  What a waste of money!!!
B0009S2T0M|4.0|Interesting, but all reviews that I read of \\"Oldboy\\" either praise the movie or decry it to the limit. I think it's already a good sign when a film doesn't leave everybody indifferent. Actually I have mixed feelings about it. On one hand I liked \\"Oldboy\\" for being rather unusual, on the other - there were many complex things difficult for comprehension. Partly because the storyline is intricate, and partly because of asian mentality which is sometimes rather sophisticated (at least for me).<br /><br />The plot is flawless and that's a very good thing, because you don't have to say to yourself all the time: \\"That's not possible, I'm not buying it\\". There were some things and characters' actions that seemed unmotivated, but again I tend to explain it with mentalities distinctions, I don't think those were the plot holes.<br /><br />Anyway even if you are not going to like \\"Oldboy\\" you'll have to admit the film is different. Some say it reminds \\"Ichi the Killer\\" (which I haven't seen), to me it seemed reminiscent of \\"Memento\\", they share the same mood of despair and gloominess.<br /><br />\\"Oldboy\\" is very stylish and well-crafted, every scene and every shot look like they're on their place, it's very elaborate and beautiful (although there are many violent moments). Many scenes became instantly famous among cinephiles, like the corridor fight scene, that lasts several minutes and is done with one take. Especially I'd like to mention brilliant music which is the third part (or even the half) of film's success.<br /><br />I'm sure I'm going to watch \\"Oldboy\\" for the second time to clear certain things out, but after the first viewing I was left with the impression of something fresh and innovative, which appeares rather often lately when watching asian (and Korean in particular) movies. For one thing I'm sure, you won't get bored, if you decide to see this.
B00005JOIF|5.0|Steven Spielberg's latest movie \\"Munich\\" is not to be missed. Based on the book by George Jonas, VENGENCE: THE TRUE STORY OF AN ISRAELI COUNTER-TERRORIST TEAM, it wrestles with the age-old question-- certainly one that U. S. leaders faced after 9/11-- of whether or not nations and individuals, for that matter, have the right to take an eye for an eye or take what they perceive as justice in their own hands without the benefit of a fact-finding tribunal. (The actor who plays Golda Meir says early in the film that \\"every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values.\\") And what happens if you get the wrong eye, or if the eye is not guilty of this crime but of another just as heinous. And doesn't revenge breed more revenge and where does it all end? These are obviously hard questions. The film looks at both perspectives.<br /><br />Six members of the Israeli secret police set out to hunt down eleven Palestinians who allegedly were responsible for the kidnapping and killing of Israeli athletes in the 1972 Olympics in Munich. (I still remember the sheer horror of watching the events on television and the sad but beautiful funeral music-- I believe it was something by Beethoven -- when the outrageous events occurred.) All the actors give superb performances. Eric Bana as Avner, the leader of the Israeli group is outstanding. He grapples with the morality question as what he is doing as a killer is contrasted with tender scenes with him and his wife and new baby whom he moves to Brooklyn. Daniel Craig and the other actors as just as good so Bana is just first among equals. The plot moves quickly and is convoluted although not impossible to follow. The sheer number of actors is rather staggering.  Tony Kushner of ANGELS IN AMERICA fame was involved in writing the screenplay. This has to be as good as anything Spielberg has ever done.
B000BTJDG2|3.0|This movie was good, but not nearly as good as The Exorcist. My only concerns with it are that it's so chopped up. When i say this i mean that the story keeps skipping back and fourth to the past and present...when Emily Rose was under/or going under possession, etc. (It would have been better if they had just told the story as it was from the beginning and continued from there).But in the end, it was a good movie, and was not overdone like many recent horror films i've seen this year.   Try this one out.
B0002KVUKW|5.0|This is one of my favorite DVD's.  I NEVER would have picked it up on my own, but it was a gift and being too polite for my own good, I felt obligated to watch it.  I'm so glad that I did.  It is an over the top, action oriented, FUN adventure.  The references to other monster flicks is well done, amusing and vastly entertaining.  The special effects are incredible.  It is like picking up a great comic book and watching it come to life!  I liked the Mummy for the same sorts of reasons, but found this DVD to be even more entertaining than that.  If you like the witty repartee of shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, you will enjoy this script.
B000B8QEYC|3.0|At age 16 I purchased \\"Watermark\\". I was in 10th grade, it was February 1989, and the type of music Enya was making was very different from everything else at the time. I saw the video for \\"Orinoco Flow\\" on VH1 and was sold (as were my friends). Well, I'm 33 now, and cynical and jaded (as I was at 16, too). Enya doesn't fool me anymore. I might as well listen to \\"Watermark\\" and \\"Shepherd Moons\\" as listen to \\"Amarantine\\", Enya's sixth studio album. They're all pretty much interchangeable. The only reason her last album \\"A Day Without Rain\\" sold over 6 million copies was due to a strange coincidence of 9/11 and a remix of \\"Only Time\\", a version that wasn't even on that album. I hated the remix, and I thought how cliche that the American public, while in mourning and shock, would turn to \\"Only Time\\" of all songs (after all, \\"A Day Without Rain\\" had been out for almost a year with no notice).<br /><br />So, \\"Amarantine\\", like all of Enya's other works is soothing and pure escapist new age music. As with all of her albums it's pick and choose amongst the songs. I thought the title track, \\"Long Long Journey\\", \\"Sumiregusa\\" and \\"Someone Said Goodbye\\" could all be included on a new Enya best of compilation (which I could make since I own all of her albums). To listen to \\"Amarantine\\" all the way through its 45 minute length is truly no different than listening to her other albums.<br /><br />I like Enya, but I am artistically disappointed by her stubborness to NOT try anything new musically. She uses the same songwriters and producers for each album and makes one new release every five years (the real reason for this must be because she wouldn't sell the same model of car every year, consumers would get suspicious!) In this way, she hoodwinks the public because every five years the general public has forgotten who she is and therefore there is a new flock of sheep who have never heard of her to buy her music.<br /><br />How many more years will Enya continue to recycle her past work? She's a multi-millionaire now, why not try something completely different? What has she got to lose at this point? My three star rating mean average, folks. It's okay, but nothing new or great. I'll be here in another five years to say the same thing (you can still read my post five years ago about her last album, \\"A Day Without Rain\\"!)her past work? She's a multi-millionaire now, why not try something completely different? What has she got to lose at this point? My three star rating mean average, folks. It's okay, but nothing new or great.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|I will make this short and sweet because I hated this movie with every fiber of my being. But, before I actually sat through the movie at the theater, I considered myself to be a major believer in the pre-release hype. I love the television series because of it's sence of pure adventure. I, a black man, am not too fond of country music, but the theme song of this series was a catchy tune that I have never tried to forget. I was so looking foreword to this movie. <br />The first slap to my face when the movie started was the absance of the theme music. UNFORGIVABLE! Second, the lack of the humor in the television show was jarring to me. Third, and most important,- Josh Wedon kills off the two characters that I identify with. That fact was a dagger through my goddamn heart. There is more but I will stop with these facts. <br />The movie pulled in about 25 million at the box office. In order for Josh Whedon to have delivered a blockbuster he would have had to have  given movie goers a reason to attend the movie two or three times. He did not deliver. He turned what should have been an uplifting romp that forced viewers to repeated viewings into a depressing, letdown that forced viewers to ponder what they had just seen. The proof of this assertion is in the box office receipts. <br />Josh Wedon has made his living producing quirky, screw-with-your-head product. SERENITY should have demanded more respect than Mr. Whedon held back. <br />I mean, come on Josh Whedon, you kill off two main characters - characters who's back-stories had not even been remotely tapped into. But, and I do not understand this piece of bullcrap - YOU ALLOW THE BAD GUY, A SELF-PROFESSED MURDERER OF CHILDREN AND WOMEN, TO NOT ONLY LIVE BUT RUN OFF INTO THE SUNSET WITH A GODDAMN SMILE AND SMIRK ON HIS FACE. And I am suppose to want to see this mess again? And pay money for admittance? NO! <br />Actually, I should have started this review with the question, 'What in the hell is wrong with Josh Whedon?' <br />The DVD itself is a must have if you are a crazed fan of the director. It is full of the extras stuff you desire. Just remember, as you plunk down your hard earned money for this DVD, you were screwed this Summer by Josh Whedon. You don't know it because you were asleep. I am here to tell you what actually happened to you!
B000002OX7|5.0|Some might say that Tommy or Quadrophenia might be The Who's greatest albums and they might have valid point(s) but to me Who's Next is the ultimate ride for any classic rock connoisseur.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I took my daughter to see Serenity in the Theater, and was totally blown away.  Since then I've bought two complete disc series, one as a gift and one for my self. I plan on showing everyone who will watch it with me, what a great program this is.  The freshness in the story lines and the interaction of the awesome characters draw you into this awkward family and makes you feel happy once again to be watching TV and know you're not waisting time.  I'd ressurect this tv series if I had the power, but maybe adding my voice to the thousands of others will get the attention of someone who can.
B000AMPZF8|5.0|Muse's second album, \\"Origin of Symmetry\\" is by far their best effort.  And no, that's not their second album following \\"Absolution\\" as many Americans will sadly believe.  OOS was released in the states only recently, however it was their second full length album released in Europe after their first, \\"Showbiz\\" (which should be checked out as well).   <br /> <br />The album starts out with one of my favorite Muse songs - Newborn.  This song covers a huge range from the melodic piano at the beginning to the fantastic guitar riffs and solo in the middle.  It is a great showcase of Muse's ability to jump from one style to another with flow and grace.  The third track, Space Dementia, is an overblown epic piece which, if you are a fan of the dramatic rock (think Queen), you will probably love.  Other standout tracks include Bliss, Plug in Baby, Citizen Erased, and Megalomania.  The organ work on the latter is dark and moody - making a great statement and a fantastic way to end this album. <br /> <br />Muse is not Radiohead.  Don't expect them to be.  They're better and more creative.  If you ever get a chance to see them live - you must not pass it up.  They put on the best shows I have ever seen and Matt Bellamy (lead vocals/guitar/keyboard) sings fantastically live - not to mention the talents of drummer Dom Howard and bassist Chris Wolstenhome.  This is a band which  may not have a huge media frenzy around them, but will stay the course and be around for a while for all of their fans to enjoy.  Don't miss out.
B000777J2S|5.0|I can see people not liking this artist or this album quite easily. But I fail to see why \\"I am a Bird Now\\" would generate the vitriol by some of the (few) negative reviewers. Not their cup of tea? No problem. 'Sucks like poo . . .'? I sense the possibility of a bit of homophobia, especially given the subject matter of the lyrics (which I didn't even notice until after I started looking at the liner notes, reading the credits, and paying attention to the lyrics. Didn't change my opinion about the album (5 stars) but at least I can understand how some people might react - not justifiable, but understandable.<br /><br />I just got this as a gift today on Christmas, and I consider it the treasure of the day. My sister-in-law who sent this to me was almost apologetic for sending it, but still claimed it was one of her favorite albums albeit pointing out that it's \\"a bit strange.\\"<br /><br />I looked at the cover and wondered who the nice looking female model was, shrugged, popped it in the CD player in the kitchen and started doing the dishes. I wasn't even listening to the words that closely but found myself beginning to cry a little. Then I started listening real hard.<br /><br />It's a unique album that I'll be passing on to friends for years. It's lyrical; stilted; weepy; soaring; odd; and throw lots of other incongruous adjectives as well.<br /><br />Thanks, Zil! My favorite Xmas present for 2005.
630356688X|5.0|One Christmas Eve, thirty years ago give or take, I woke up the house because I was watching \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" on late night television (which was the only way to see it at that time) and as George Bailey ran back to the bridge to tell Clarence that he wanted to live again the station went to a commercial break.  As Kenneth Burke said a long time ago, form is the creation of an appetite and the satisfying of that appetite in the mind of an audience.  So there I was, getting all ready to start weeping when the snow starts to fall again, and suddenly I am being bombarded with commercials for the sort of projects that are only advertised in the middle of the night.  One reason to own your own copy is that not only can you control the breaks, but you can also watch it any time you need a little Christmas.<br /><br />The general consensus is that \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" is a timeless holiday classic, a black & white movie that NBC is proudly airing tonight on Christmas Eve once again, because of the point that Clarence Oddbody, AS2 makes to George when he tell him, \\"Remember, George: no man is a failure who has friends.\\"  The point is underscored as the film's benediction when Clarence writes that reminder in the copy of Mark Twain's \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\" and when Harry Bailey proposes a toast to his big brother George as \\"the richest man in town.\\"  The grand irony here is that the only person who does not know these things ends up being George Bailey himself, and the fact that Jimmy Stewart is perfect in the role does not hurt either.<br /><br />But I would contend that \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" is also a timeless classic for the simple reason that it makes you cry even more the second time around.  Once you have seen Frank Capra's 1946 film you cannot help but notice how everything in the nightmare sequence is set up earlier in the movie.  Certainly you remember what happened with Mr. Gower and when Harry fell through the ice, but the first time through did you pick when Mary said she married George to keep from being an old maid?  Once you know the story the whole opening litany of prayers (\\"Something's the matter with daddy\\") can get you chocked up.  For me I lose it when young Mary leans over into George's bad ear and says, \\"George Bailey, I'll love you 'till the day I die\\" (and not because I am deaf in one ear either, but because I am a hopeless romantic).<br /><br />Like so many of the director's classic \\"Capra-corn\\" films, namely \\"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,\\" \\"Mr. Deeds Goes to Town,\\" and \\"Meet John Doe,\\" the story of George Bailey is basically a crucifixion story.  Voltaire once said that the crucifix represents the wise man assassinated, and in each of those films there is certainly a point where the hero is symbolically crucified in public: to wit, the impeachment in the Senate, the competency hearing, and the mass rally.  But only George Bailey actually descends into Hell as he sees what the world would have been like if he had never been born.  Such stories have become a commonplace on television (\\"Smallville\\" did it for Lex Luthor earlier this month and I have fond memories of the one \\"Moonlighting\\" did), and there are countless movies in which the main character gets a chance to see the road not taken.  The genre goes back at least to \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" but whereas Ebenezer Scrooge is the ancestor of Mr. Potter, George Bailey has always lived a good life.  George is so selfless he claims he was the one that lost the money when he goes to Mr. Potter for help.  The guy cannot help but do the right thing.<br /><br />Granted, there are some imperfections in this divine film, just as a Persian carpet always contains a flaw.  For me the initial levity of Clarence as a blinking star is a bit too cute after the stage is set up by the people of Bedford Falls on bended knee entreating for divine intervention for George.  But once Henry Travers shows up as Clarence in person that is rectified (I like the way hetells George, \\"You've never been born,\\" as if what was about to happen was the most natural thing in the world.  However, the errors I recall now with regards to this film are my own.  The first couple of times I saw the film I thought that Mr. Potter showed up at the end to join in the festivities because the magic of Christmas was such that even his heart grew to the right size.  For years I was convinced that when they are searching Uncle Billy's hovel for the missing money and it looks like somebody will be going to prison that George not only says \\"It's not going to be me,\\" but adds \\"for once in my life it is not going to be me.\\"<br /><br />The romance between Stewart's George and Donna Reed's Mary stands on its own: you could do a movie that ends with them on their wedding night and have a winner.  Still, the reason that the ending is so glorious is that \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" gets really dark before the dawn.  The extreme closeup that Capra shoots of Stewart when the enormity of the fall hits George is absolutely harrowing, as is the terror in his face when the spinster Mary collapses and George has totally lost it, because we understand exactly what that means.  In the end we come back to Clarenece's message because George's only problem is that he does not know this simple and profound truth (and because Mary and the people of Bedford Falls have taken care of the missing money regardless of Clarence's intervention).  That is why this is a wonderful movie.ike the way he tells George, \\"You've never been born,\\" as if what was about to happen was the most natural thing in the world.

B000ANVQ0K|2.0|Yes it has a lot of features. Why split the movie to two discs? <br />To me that is annoying. If they split it why not add the deleted <br />scenes to the movie. Maybe then I could understand the split. <br />A 2 disc set probably would have sufficed.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show is one of the greatest TV shows I've ever seen.  In general, I am more of a movie person due to the more intricate plot and the uninterupted action, but this show breaks all of my expectations and preconceptions. <br /> <br />Firefly has more plot depth and character interaction in every 45 minute episode than and full-length movie I have ever seen.  In addition, every episode in this, while short, show is meaningful and entertaining.  There are no \\"filler episodes\\" but rather just quality television that I find myself coming back to over and over again.  In addition, the music of Firefly is among my favorite of all time, TV or otherwise.  The theme song will stick in your head forever, and unlike other 'song viruses,' you won't care! <br /> <br />The only drawback is that there aren't more episodes.  You will reach the end of the fourteenth episode and just sort of stare at the screen blankly, thinking \\"now what???\\"  Still, I would recommend this series to anyone with eyes, ears, and half a brain. This is truly Joss Whedon at his best, and his best is very, VERY, good.

B000BTJDGC|3.0|Watching the trailers and TV spots for the film you can't help thinking this looks like a great horror movie. However if you watch this as a horror movie you will be very very disappointed. The movie is however an excellent drama, well played out with moments that are more on the horror/suspense side of things. <br /> <br />The movie focuses not on the \\"excorcism of emily rose\\" (which is a little confusing since thats the movie's title), but rather the trail that came afterward in the real life events of 1976 the movie is based on. Tom Wilkenson does a masterful job in playing Father Moore, The Rose family parrish priest who tends to emily after modern medicine fails her, and eventually attempts and fails at an excorcism on Emily. Not long after the failed excorcism does Emily die, and Father Moore is sentenced with murder threw neglegence. <br /> <br />Assigned to defend Father Moore is a up and coming agnostic attorney played by the always excellent Laura Linney. Basically within twenty minutes or so the movie begins to play out the trail and the strange events around the trail, as Emily's story is told in a series of flashbacks as witnesses take the stand. Jennifer Carpenter portrays Emily and does so quite poignantly, bringing a quiet strength to the character. <br /> <br />It is a slow-burner at times, but it is well worth a look. Just make sure you're aware of what it is you're watching before you begin or you'll be sorely disappointed. I was thankfully warned of this as I was renting it.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Firefly was a great series taken from us far too soon.  This big screen follow-up shows that the characters and stories had the depth to go much longer.  As a stand-alone film, the story telling, action,  and characters are first rate.  When compared to poorly written and acted movies like \\"Revenge of the Sith\\" this is a far better movie.    While I know people who enjoyed the movie as an introduction to Firefly, to best appreciate the unfolding richness of the Firefly 'verse, pick up the series first.  <br /> <br />The DVD features the standard outakes and excellent deleted scenes making me long for an \\"extended edition.\\"  Commentary by Joss is always fun and informative.

0767803434|5.0|This motion picture is in the best traditions of Harrison Ford films, e.g., lots of action, a hero saving the day, etc.  The DVD quality is super, resized for the TV screen with excellent sound quality.  If you like action adventure, you will like the motion picture.  The details have been covered by other reviewers.  There is an attempt to hijack Air Force One.  Some good people are killed along with the bad guys.  It is one of those films that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Friends had asked what I wanted for Christmas.  I told them they could get me some DVDs in the action/adventure category, e.g., Harrison Ford, etc., and I was not disappointed.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|This is a great album all around.  Mayer's new compositions are rich with great guitar playing, and the trio is so tight in their performance together.  This is one of the best albums I've heard in a while, and Mayer shows his superb guitar, and performance skills on this album, along with the great rythym section of Palladino and Jordan he has with him.  So what if it isn't a \\"true\\" blues album per say, it is an awesome recording with some great tracks on it.  Saying because it isn't a \\"true\\" blues album is just showing ignorance for the appreciation of music.  This is a great album over all, and I look forward to what this group can do in the future.

B00005QF6O|5.0|This lens is great! It's my first L lens, after upgrading from the 75-300 F/4-5.5 IS USM lens.  I must say the only drawback is that it's so heavy --- 3.1 lbs.  BUT, because of the IS I'm able to take handheld pictures.  The only way I could get sharp images tho, is by using a monopod/tripod.  Of course that could just be me too.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  But if I were doing it all over again, I'd test the lens first at a local camera shop (rent one for a day or so) so I could get the hang of it before I went out shooting w/ mine.<br /><br />I rate it 9/10!

6305508550|5.0|I got this as a Christmas present at a Secret Santa giftswap and loved it. When I initially opened up the box my first impressions was: just another movie with Jeniffer Aniston from Friends..possibly boring. After watching it my worries have been completely lifted. This movie tells you about all the things in corporate America they never teach you about in business school: it teaches you how to not work and get promoted, how skipping work is ok, how to outpromote your boss and how to retire stinkin rich even if you are mildly retarded. It's a comedy that brings up front a bunch of guys from a 2000 bank software changeover company, the dreaded 99 going to 00 issue that was happening at the time, and their meaningless day to day jobs. The plot picks up as soon as Jennifer Aniston comes into the scene, a waitress in a dead-end restaurant where everyone is expected to do more than minimum but still receive minimum job satisfaction and respect. The main characther-programmer is so desilusioned with his job that he undergoes work therapy hypnosis with a guy that focuses on getting rid of work worries and inhibitions. Problem is that as the guy was bringing the main characther back the hypnotherapist dies of a heart attack. The programmer is left without a worry of losing his job and surprisingly goes on a winning streak  which will change his life for the better.<br /><br />You will be surprised of how many things you don't know about corporate America that one little movie can teach you in a funny, intuitive way.
B000AP04FG|3.0|I was hyped for an experience more like \\"True Lies\\".  What you get here are a few very poorly executed car chase scenes, a few vignettes with lots and lots of guns, very poor dialogue - and a plot line that is non-existent except to set up the next gun battle.  A very very frustratingly disappointing movie.
B000BW7QWW|2.0|I've read some of the other reviews both positive and negative on here. I'd like to point out one negative one that was horribly innacurate but I won't mention the poster. The person misspelled so many words I wondered if English was his second language and possibly barely understood it. In his review he confuses the names of characters so often I wondered if he was even paying attention throughout the movie. There are many people out there who like sci-fi movies. Some only like the simple scientifically innacurate schlock that comes in movies where some goofy alien talks like a Rastafarian and ships exploding in space make noise even though sound doesn't travel in a vacuum. For the rest of us that like a certain amount of realism, grit and depth of characters movies like Star Wars don't cut it. Serenity is more than just a sci-fi action film. It contains subtleties that would escape obvious low intellectual capacity of the writers of most of the negative reviews. I have to say in fairness some very astute people may not \\"get it\\" or like it because their tastes run to something else but in my own opinion based on watching hundreds of films and reading thousands of sci-fi novels (at least a 1/3 of which were recycled ideas or just plain plagiarism)this movie is just plain excellent to both entertain and amuse you. The characters have depth and while the movie is only two hours compared to the Firefly series where the characters had more time to be revealed it still does a fine job. The universe in which Joss Whedon placed his characters has an Old West feel to it, kinda scruffy and not too tidy, which makes it more convincing to me than all the gloss and glitter of Star Wars since it is after all a frontier like the Old West but set in the 25th century in another star system. The action sequences are fast moving and the plot is strong. One of the negative reviewers said that they expected more from the movie given it's huge production budget. This movie only cost 39million to make and yet the special effects rival some movies that cost over 100 million and still stank so I can only conclude the negative reviewer was either smoking something funny, a complete moron or just didn't check his or her facts. I'd say give this movie a chance and if you don't buy it at least rent it someplace. I'm sure the majority of you once you see it would want to add it to your collection. I'd also strongly recommend the Firefly boxed set which contains the first and only season and watch it in the proper order as contained in the set, not in the brain dead micromanaged order that the same pinhead at Fox that cancelled the show insisted the show be broadcast in. That had as much to do with the low ratings the show recieved as the fact that Fox placed it in a doomed to fail timeslot for a sci-fi series. When I see how many quality shows Fox has produced only to undermine them and then cancel them to the ire of fans I find myself wondering why they are in the entertainment business at all. I can only praise Universal for making this movie but wished they had done a better job of marketting it as it would have improved the box office gross. I hope they do a sequel or that the Sci Fi channel picks up the rights and does a mini-series or two so I can continue to buy DVDs that feature this rich and realistic view of the future that Joss Whedon created.
B00000JLWW|2.0|One of the most disappointing movies I've seen in years.  The story is ludicrous - a completely unrealistic soap opera (nearly impossible during this time period), with one-dimensional villains Zane and Warner, more concerned with bumping off the innocuous Leo than in saving themselves from the sinking ship.  Just when you think the thing can't get any sillier, the villains and their intended victims go sloshing through knee-deep water (which, by the way, would have been freezing cold on that horrible April night in the north Atlantic, but appears to be a comfy swimming pool here) trying to shoot one another.  Beyond all that, the characters are among the most one-dimensional ever put on film.  Everyone who ever earned an honest dollar, or managed to amass some wealth, is evil; those without a plugged nickel are one step removed from sainthood.    As a Titanic junkie I had to sit through the whole wretched thing and I did enjoy seeing the nicely reconstructed ship in full color, but in the future, when I want to see a good film on the Titanic disaster, I'll watch \\"A Night to Remember,\\" or re-read Walter Lord's wonderful book again.  This thing is as big a sinker as the old Barbara Stanwyck turkey of the same title.      Among its countless ventures into lousy judgment and poor taste, as well as misfires, giving this film a record-tying 11 Oscars has to rank with the blackest eyes the Academy ever earned.  'King of the world' my foot!
0743490304|3.0|I have read three of Dan Browns works so far, I loved the Da Vinic code because well it opened up some question about Jesus, Mary, and Christianity! Not that it made me doubt my faith but just that it showed some new and interesting things! So, I read his first novel because of Da Vinic Code didn't love it as much but I thought it was pretty okay, loved that the book had to do with Antimatter and a group of scientist, they were particle and nuclear physicists, not condense matter like me, but that's all right!<br /><br />Now enough about his past books lets talk about perception point... err, I mean deception point. Deception point is the same old formular used in both \\"Da Vinic Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons.\\" Even though I didn't know what was going to happen I did know what was going to happen, you follow me! The characters aren't developed enough and they are very one dimensional. My prime example is \\"Corky!\\" Corky is suppose to be a genius scientist. A stellar phyiscist who has won a nobel prize! (I'm working on being a physiscist, myself) so I was particular interested in this character: Getting the girl, solving the big problem, etc, etc. Instead I'm treated to a loser who brags about peeing on his leg and making stupid jokes! I admit, when Corky first comes on the scene, I think, \\"Oh a physicsits with a sense of humor; how delightful!\\" But over time, I just realized he just there to remind the audience of \\"Fusion Crust!\\" Dan Brown obviously couldn't find any use for him besides that and he's completely blind to the fact that \\"The main chick!\\" and \\"The main dude!\\" has the hots for each other, boy I didn't see that coming but I was only looking an inch infront of my face. A nobel prize winning physicsits should be able to do more then just remind the audience of \\"Fusion Crust\\" He should be a second brain trying to fiqure out different possibilities faster and better then a tv show host and somebody who fiqures out cryptic messages for a living. I take that back if anything Corky should have played a bigger role helping our main female character fiqure out how the astroid wasn't real. Final when our astroid was proven false, Corky is nowhere to be seen. At this point I was realing hoping he was the badguy, our main bad guy! But he wasn't! No he's just a sterotypical loser nerd that even F-up getting some, and there I quote, \\"Nerd tail!\\" In short, what you see is what you getting! I was really hoping for 'More then meets the eye!' Like Einstein, Fermi, and Feynman and my three favorite mentors: Doctor Bowen, Collins, and Ueda! but sadly Corky makes us look very bad!<br /><br />I went on rants before, but this Corky character really gets me! Now lets turn the light on the other characters. I have seen them before. They are just Robert Langdon and Sophie with different names, with more more or less intelligence not enough to distinquish the four from their Da Vinic Code counterparts!ck if anything Corky should have played a bigger role helping our main female character fiqure out how the astroid wasn't real.

0307276902|2.0|This book is readable, but it seemed more like an after-school special, where the poor little rich kid gets hooked on the pipe.  In his quest for terminal-uniqueness, James Frey falls short in his gratitude that he's lucky to be alive.  An ego-centric fella, I'm sure Mr. Frey is awaiting his Oscar nominated script and is visualizing Johnny Depp playing himself.    I put this book down and I feel like it's fallen short.  That I have been cheated and it just somehow doesn't ring true to me.  I want to read the story of Lilly.  In her brief appearance, she has struck a cord in my heart and I yearn to know her just a little bit more.    This is probably the first graphical account of drug use that Oprah has ever read, and it's poor at best.  I highly recommend books like \\"Permanent Midnight\\" \\"Scar Tissue\\" and \\"The Dirt\\" over this ho-hum account.
B00005JN0T|5.0|I, Robot is the slickest sci-fi action film since Matrix Reloaded.  The script has zero ounce of fat.  Action sequences are as smooth as the surface of the futuristic-looking cars driven by Will in the film.  The robots are tough, shining, graceful as the alloys of which they are made of.      I only wish that George Lucas had used these robots in place of the dumb droids in Phantom Menace.
B00062J00S|5.0|Review no. 277. Excellent 1946 black & white movie classic, that are one of the VERY few B&W flicks I've ever watched repeatedly. Most compelling story about a married couple George and Mary Bailey (James Stewart and Donna Reed) who has four kids and their tale of a business hardship. Too many memorable scenes to list here. My absolute favorite scene is when Bailey tells the old fart, Mr.Potter off - who seems to own about everything (if not most everything in town). A true tear-jerker. See it with someone you love. Strictly a seasonal film to watch. Recommended.

Some key tracks: \\"Ray of Light\\", \\"The Power of Good-bye\\", \\"Sky Fits Heaven\\", and \\"Candy Perfume Girl\\". Enjoy.

B000007MVM|5.0|this review may seem idiosyncratic, but all i can say about this work is how it makes me feel. from the heart Barrett means this work. not to say that others in the craft don't but many are following a carrot. Barrett had already followed and eaten the poisoned carrot with nothing left to gain or lose than to loll away these silly and beautiful songs. Barrett's work takes me away and even makes me feel good about strummnig out a few bars of my own. his work makes me feel glad to be alive, aging and doing my own thing without fear or hope of some other reward than the satisfaction of creation. something i value here is in Barrett's mistakes because he doesn't make mistakes, he un-makes them.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|This is one of the best albums I own. It is exceeding all expectations I had of it, and it certainly lives up to all the hype it made. Much better than 2003's \\"American Life\\"
0316172324|4.0|I don't know that I buy everything (or even very much) that the author says about the whole \\"thin slicing\\" thing, but I enjoyed reading his ideas. I agree with Eric Antonow's review that the book contains a lot of speculation, and Gladwell does a poor job of unifying the stories, but individually the stories and ideas are fascinating.  This book should be read with a healthy dose of skepticism, but do read it, because it is a fun read, and it really makes you think - always a good thing.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|I bought this record for \\"Soul Meets Body\\", after seeing Death Cab perform it live on Comedy Central's Last Laugh '05. While I continue to play that particular track endlessly (it has an addictive hook), I have come to love the album for its other tracks, particularly the beautiful \\"Brothers on a Hotel Bed.\\" My favorite lyric from that song:    \\"and I have learned  that even landlocked lovers yearn  for the sea like navy men\\"    I am also loving \\"Summer Skin\\", with its quiet, military snare accompanying a whistful piano and bass.    \\"Plans\\" is simply masterful from top to bottom, and will be on your playlist for years to come!
0375507256|5.0|I think the calls in reviews below for a \\"justification\\" for the structure miss the point. To assume that the links between the stories need to be more than thematic (and, in small ways, plot-related) is to ask Cloud Atlas to be like a TV crime drama where the interconnectedness of all the mysteries all comes together at the end. Even if these stories had no link, they would still be beautifully written, thought-provoking, interesting and entertaining.  <br /> <br />Mitchell's technical command is astounding, as ever, as he moves through a range of stories. The stories are enhanced by their collectivity, which makes the messages and thematic points stronger. But not every aspect of every story need point towards a political message; they may merely be entertaining and clever on the way. I particularly loved 'Letters from Zedelghem'. Mitchell's brilliant ability to voice differently characters really brings them to life, and the prose is as dizzyingly post-modern as in his previous, brilliant Number9dream. I don't agree with other readers that the second halves moved slower; if anything, I think they moved quicker. The endings of the stories are also stunningly written, and frequently moving. Thoroughly reccomended.
B00005JOIF|3.0|Despite the compelling subject matter: Israel avenging the murder of her athletes by the Palestinians at the Munich Olympics in 1972, Steven Spielberg's\\" Munich\\" generally lacks the forward propulsion to make it as interesting and important as its subject matter.<br />Though, without a doubt there are several thrilling scenes and terrific performances: for one, Eric Bana as Avner the man to whom Golda Meir (a powerful Lynne Cohen) hands over the power, the money and the right to avenge her fallen athletes and for another Geoffrey Rush as Efraim, Avner's handler.<br />Bana's Avner is a solid, upright man, a minor field agent used to minor assignments but whose unwavering allegiance to Israel and for all that it stands as well as being the son of a hero and a powerful, forthright mother (a thoughtful, conflicted Gila Almagor) who tells him: \\"We (Jews) finally have a place to call our own...We must not let anyone take it away\\" (paraphrase).<br /> Bana is very powerful particularly in scenes that require that he perform deeds that would make most of us shudder and falter...his Avner moves ahead without hesitation. Bana's thoughtful face and resolute demeanor make his Avner a man that many would and do follow into battle. Though he is often racked with soul and spirit numbing guilt and later in life with heart-stopping paranoia, Avner never wavers, never tires, never lets down his guard: his pursuit of revenge is indestructable.<br />The scenes involving the murder of the athletes are the most gruesome, the most shocking and the best choreographed and edited: these scenes  make their point through the accumulation of  precise, exact and focused detail...there's not an inch of film in these scenes that is wasted....masterful. If only Spielberg had used the same discretion with the film as a whole: \\"Munich\\" is too long by about 20 minutes, the editing is often flaccid and this is a tragic shame, to be honest for the subject matter is rife with all the things that make for suspenseful, exciting drama.<br />\\"Munich\\" is graced with several exciting scenes and some magical performances but ultimately it is not a great film though it is a very good one.

0887307280|3.0|First of all - it is very hard to prove why a business succeds or fails.  There are just too many factors that impact the outcome; consider these...    1 The state of the economy  2 Experience of the entrepreneur  3 Competition from local / overseas products / services  4 Employees you hire  5 Local regulatory / other government related factors  6 Inability to get the capital when needed  7 Poor contracts and negotiating skills on part of the owners  8 ...  You get the idea...    How can one claim that if you create a business such that it can be run by the least qualified / capable people, and it does not need you, it will be successful?      Using the example of MacDonalds is a nice way to drive the point across, but also somewhat misguiding - lack of knowledge about what is good for the customer results in businesses that cause immense harm to society at large. What complicates matters further is that when such businesses become successful -they reinforce the false righteousness of the owners    The author does make some good points though - I will mention two...    a) you need to work on the business, not in it.  Even more important is the ratio of time spent working \\"on\\" vs working in.  This will depend on the stage, and nature of the business.        b) processes that the business relies on should be consistent and repeatable.  This is something \\"quality\\" professionals have known for ages.  Deming said this during the 1950s - not many listened to him in the US; Japan did.     Read the book - be careful in applying what you learn...if you are an entrepreneur - there is nothing wrong in starting a business and doing what you know best.  Just be sensitive to the needs of the business - these will change and you will need to be flexible.     Eventually it all depends on what you want to do with your life. There are many who do not look at their business as the end all and be all.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I'll preface by saying that I became a huge fan of the TV series Firefly and anxiously awaited the arrival of Serenity.  Joss Whedon (creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel) created an amazing cinematic vision with Serenity.  Probably one of the most endearing things about the Firefly/Serenity story is that it is a science fiction story that does not rely on the typical sci-fi gimmicks.  The main emphasis of the story is on the relationship of the characters and not alien races, technological gadgets, or flashy special effects.   <br /> <br />The story follows Captain Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) on a quest of his convictions.  Meanwhile his crew consists of a wonderfully talented and colorful group of actors and characters.  Among these is River Tam (Summer Glau), a refugee of the Big Brother-ish Alliance.  Due to various experiments by the Alliance, River is left rather mentally unstable and is trying to sort out the origins of her cryptic and confusing visions and voices while trying to keep her fellow crew safe from her psychosis.  In the meantime, an Alliance Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor) seeks to capture River dead or alive. <br /> <br />Watching the television series beforehand is not vital to understanding the story, but it will give the viewer added insight, understanding, and appreciation for several details of the movie.  The very human characters and actors create an intense and amazing chemistry, and the energy is definitely bouncing between them.  My only complaint about the movie is that due to its time restrictions, and a full exploration of the different characters is not afforded.  Having said that, my only complaint of the DVD is that a cast commentary as a bonus feature would have been absolutely wonderful, especially considering the chemistry between actors.  Oh well, perhaps on a future edition of the DVD.
B00023BLXK|5.0|Amazing Story based on real events that happened over fifty years  ago  during political chaos in Cuba has little connection to the Dirty Dancing masterpiece of the 1980s, except for the name and a certain extended cameo appearance by one of the original film's stars, that is.    HAVANA NIGHTS tells a  compelling story of a young girl forced to relocate to Cuba when her father gets a job over there and ends up meeting a local boy who teaches her how to tap into her spiritual side by self expression in the form of dancing. Her parents of course are portrayed as old fuddie duddies at first but eventually come to realise their daughter is old enough to choose what she wants out of life, and inevitably she and the boy fall in love.   Entering a dance competition,  the two  take to the floor and astound  just about everyone present.     But before  the young dancers are able to  fully   embrace the passion required for the moves in the contest, some necessary help is gained  by a certain dance instructor who will no doubt be very familiar to just about every female on the planet, and movie lovers everywhere.  Patrick Swayze appears for several scenes and provides rather memorable moments that really add to the overall enjoyment of the story, making this an amazing cinematic experiece that will take your breath away! Also his dance partner in the first scene at the dance studio is in reality the woman whose life this film is based on. This only makes this movie rate even higher for all the cleverness that comes out of it.     I got this DVD  this morning as a Christmas gift from my parents and just now finished it and sat down to write this review, so you know it is that good. Also of note is the song you hear at the end of the film when the young lovers have their last dance. It is called \\"Hips Don't Lie\\" and is by Shakira, and available on her most recent release.      Order HAVANA NIGHTS today and have a very  Merry Christmas!! I know I sure will!

0679422714|3.0|I am chinese, who does not like Mao either, after read this book I think I can wrote something about it even my written english is not so good: <br /> <br />If you want to read a serious history book about Mao, it is not the one.  <br />Before I bought and read this book, I read the interview of Jung Chang, taken by Deutsche Welle. <br />Chang said, she supposed this book can cause a discussion between historists, but she was so disappointed. She hope, after the chinese translation published in Taiwan, the Taiwanese historists will pay more attention to this book.  <br />Now, this book has already published in Taiwan, and caused still no response from historists, even from Taiwan, the region hates Mao more than other worlds. <br />But I really believe, this book must be introduced into China, because people can know the evil side of Mao, even he is too evil to be true in this book. It will give a neutral view to Mao, when people can read the Chairman Mao as God (official chinese version) and as evil together. This is the first star I gave for.  <br />This book is not good for the people in west countries, you can not know the facts in chinese history and Mao's history, if you only read this book. The authors were not trained to write history book in serious way, they did not wrote it logicly. <br />Example, `Half of China may well have to die'. Mao spoke this sentence to Soviet Union, because Societ Union warned China with Atom War. Mao spoke this to the enemy, by another hand, he ordered Mr Peng Dehuai to move the industries to Southwest, far away from Soviet Union. And asked people to prepare the possible atom war. All the cities have shelters, and storage for foods.  <br />This sentence means: We chinese people don't want die, but we'd better chose to fight and die than surrender under your threaten. After all, the war did not happen, no chinese people (except sodiers) was killed by Soviet Union, no invasion from north happened at all. <br />In this book, Chang used this sentence in her way, but not the way of historic facts. <br />This book is easy to read, because the author can not write academic english, i read it smoothly. This book is interesting to read, becasue it is a fiction rather than history.This is the the second star.  <br />In amazon, the lowest level is one star, so I gave this book a 3 star rate.

B000B8QEZG|2.0|This makes two clunkers in a row for Madonna. First, \\"American Life\\" proved to be a ho-hum album from one of our least boring musical personalities. <br />Now, \\"Confessions\\" continues that streak, as she returns to her dance/disco ways, but without any of the charm, any of the fun, any of the drama, any of the sexiness, or any of the great melodies and rhythms that she has given us over the last two decades. <br /> <br />The best thing on this album is \\"Hung Up\\", and it doesn't hold a candle to the jittery swagger of \\"Don't Tell Me\\" or the epic sweep of \\"Ray of Light\\". <br /> <br />Listen...you go to a dance club, and you'll hear continuous music all night long. This album is sequenced in that fashion; the songs fade into each other. While you're dancing, you'll hear songs you may or may not recognize. <br /> <br />The music will keep you going, right? It doesn't matter if you know the song...if the groove is on, you'll keep going. Every once in a while, a song will pop up that just kills the moment...it's boring; it's the wrong tempo...it's just not worth dancing to, and you'll go sit down. <br /> <br />Other songs are so amazing, you'll do anything you have to, to stay on the dance floor. Even if you're dancing with the ugliest, sweatiest, most foul-smelling creature on the planet, you won't leave until that song is over. <br /> <br />And then there are those in the middle, which are fine to dance to, yet if you really needed another drink or a bathroom break, it would be \\"OK\\". <br /> <br />This album has no songs that would keep you glued to the dance floor, and several that would usher you off. Most of it is pleasant enough.  <br />And if \\"pleasant\\" is one of the adjectives you use to best describe a Madonna record, you know you're in a bit of trouble. <br /> <br />I like the lyrics of \\"I Love New York\\", but I wish they had better support.  <br /> <br />\\"Isaac\\" might have been the album's classic track, yet the Middle-Eastern elements sounds forced and really don't benefit the song at all. This isn't like Sting's \\"Desert Rose\\". Here it sounds awful. That's quite a shame because the remainder of the song sounds pretty cool... <br /> <br />The album has a lot of producers...and normally I don't mind that. Here though, you really couldn't tell. It all sounds pretty much the same...heterogeneous...so why have three or four producers? Where's the variety, the flavor? <br /> <br />I have been fascinated with Madonna since her boy-toy days. Her continual re-invention has become the model for the modern pop star.  <br /> <br />She has taken risks, she has often failed but more often has blown us out of the water. Her sexy, provocative, luscious younger self has evolved into a more angular, lithe, muscular figure. She has flirted with most all musical trends, starting several of them herself. The moment one thinks her career is on the wane, she explodes with a killer single, an amazing album or a tour that defies expectations.  <br /> <br />She has been irresistible. <br /> <br />Until recently. I was lucky enough to see her on her last tour, and loved it. I went back to see why I clearly misjudged \\"American Life\\", and I found that I had not. <br /> <br />It still bored me to tears. And this from somebody who is embarrassed to admit that he enjoyed her cover of \\"American Pie.\\" <br /> <br />When did Madonna become utterly \\"resistible\\"?

0765309408|5.0|In my biennial foray into the Science Fiction genre, Scalzi's first novel came highly recommended by Amazon's algorithms. As a huge fan of Heinlein and, especially, Starship Troopers, Old Man's War promised a similar terrain of interstellar warfare spearheaded by Earth and mankind. <br /> <br />Scalzi doesn't disappoint. His clever, to-the-point plot introduces John Perry, a widower just turned 75. By dint of his age, Perry is now eligible to join the Colonial Defense Forces, a shadowy crew pledged at expansion of mankind's footprint throughout the galaxy. Perry doesn't have much to lose, after all. Though details of his transformation into a CDF soldier remain classified on Earth, he's lost his beloved wife and is fully aware of his diminishing physical and mental abilities. <br /> <br />After signing up for what appears to be a two-year stint, he soon finds out that his term is going to be closer to a decade. But he'll have the body to match. His physical transformation into a super soldier -- no spoilers here -- is truly remarkable. But he'll need every bit of his new capabilities because the enemies arrayed against humankind are powerful, enigmatic, and quite violent. <br /> <br />Scalzi has woven together compelling technical details (the physics behind the interstellar \\"skip\\" drive), including genetic engineering, the tactics of interstellar warfare, human-computer interfaces, and robotics into a first-class story. Fans of Starship Troopers won't be disappointed. And those who relish Heinlein stories will be clamoring for more Scalzi.
B000B7HZXM|4.0|If you like these kinds of classic tunes, buy this album.  If you don't like them, Rod Stewart isn't going to make you like them.  If you just like Rod Stewart for his rock tunes, you won't like this album.  I love it.  The arrangements are great, the studio musicians are excellent, the songs selected are excellent and the duets are fun.  It's a feel-good album.  I don't understand why these reviewers are so negative on this music!!!  It's GREAT. I listen to heavy metal, hard rock, country, classical and all that's in between, and this is a really fine \\"feel-good-take-you-back\\" album.  Play it loud alone in your car.
0452282152|3.0|I'm a sucker for historical fiction. Gary Jennings' Aztec and Ken Follett's Pillars of the Earth are probably the most enjoyable examples of period fiction based upon historical fact (with plenty of author's license utilized, to be sure). For an educator, historical fiction is a great way to introduce the study of a period without the usual commensurate pain. <br /> <br />Chevalier's Girl with a Pearl Earring was laying around our house (required reading by my 16 year-old for her AP history class, I believe). The reviews on the back cover were stunning: the Times, Journal, Chronicle and others waxed eloquently; depicting the novel as a compelling blend of 17th century Holland, the paintings of Dutch master Johannes Vermeer, and the origins of one of his most famous paintings. <br /> <br />The painting is, of course, \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring,\\" also known as \\"the Mona Lisa of the north.\\" An enigmatic young woman is featured in the painting (and on the book's cover). She is imagined by Chevalier to be one of Vermeer's maids named Griet. Griet is shy, intelligent, and too-pretty-for-her-own-good. Forced into servitude by her father's unexpected blindness, Griet becomes an essential part of Vermeer's busy household. <br /> <br />Cleverly navigating the domestic politics of a household spilling with children, a grandparent, and other maids, Griet soon finds herself receiving attention not only from Vermeer's wealthiest patron but also the great master himself. How she deals with these difficulties forms the very essence of the book. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the book's plot is so simplistic as to be almost 233 pages of nothingness. Imagine a Seinfeld episode taking place in the 17th century without any humorous characters, and you've pretty much got the idea. As for 17th century Holland, consider it unvisited. There were few details that would satisfy the mildly curious, not to mention someone truly interested in the period. Despite an elegant writing style, this bookcould have been the length of a magazine article without missing a beat.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I loved this film.  I do think you really need to see all the t.v. episodes to fully appreciate it.  Wish it had done better at the box office.  Would have been nice if they had reedited it and put the deleted scenes back into the film instead of just having them as extra features.  Still, that's my only real criticism.  Watch the series, then see the film.  It's got something for everyone, except little kids.
B000002GAF|5.0|This disc is one of those rare gems you must own. Aside from being a great vocalist, Gino had a stellar cast of jazz musicians, and by <br />today's standards, this is one greatsmooth jazz record. Every track <br />is great. I had the LP and another thing about thing about this album is I always found the sound quality superb. It is a must for <br />your collection.
B00005JKLZ|4.0|I must confess that I march to a different drummer when it comes to this film.  I enjoyed it for the most part, and find it very clever in many aspects.  The major drawback comes from the plot - it is far too simplistic for the elaborate care that went into both the visual aspect of the film as well as the nice touches at almost every turn.<br /><br />The plot is rather simple - Alexander Hartdegen, a mechanical physics professor in turn-of-the-century New York (turn of the nineteenth-into-the-twentieth century, that is), has his head in his equations, apart from one thing, his love for Emma.  When she is killed in a botched mugging (yes, New York at that time even had muggings in Central Park), Hartdegen drops everything to invent the time machine he'd theorised, in order to prevent Emma's death.  He soon makes the discovery that it isn't possible to undo the past (at least not that aspect of the past), but becomes obsessed with finding the reason why.  He speculates this is more likely to be answered in the future than in the past or present, and thus goes forward in time.  He makes a few stops along the way before arriving at a far-distant future (nearly a million years in the future), in which the human race has evolved into two distinct species - one on the surface, and one below the earth.<br /><br />So far, so good - departure from H.G. Wells' original classic (a great piece of literature) and from the earlier film, but not beyond the pale.  The effects here are truly stunning in many respects - the time machine itself is a marvel (the DVD has a feature on the making of the machine), and the time transformation scenes are very inspiring, up to and including the zoom-away shot from the machine into the air all the way to the city on the moon.  The Eloi city along the river is also a remarkable scene.  The movie rightly won awards, including the Academy Award, for these effects.  Unfortunately, effects do not a movie make.  This is where the plot failure comes into play.<br /><br />Hartdegen seems to give up far too early in trying to change the past, and his relationships (such as we get to see them) in the future are very stilted.  Jeremy Irons (himself an Academy Award winner) has precious little screen time, to deliver what is perhaps the most anticlimactic resolutions I've seen in a long time.  The overarching question should be 'why?', but seems to transformed into 'what if?' in an unclear way (the deleted introductory scene, available on the DVD, helps to more firmly establish the question, but, alas, it was deleted).  Hartdegen remains in the future (like Wells' and the earlier film's scientists, albeit in a different way), perhaps to help transform the future, but we'll never know (a sequel is not likely).<br /><br />Despite the thin plot, what I found most enjoyable (apart from the special effects) were the clever touches here and there, far too numerous to mention.  When Hartdegen arrives in 2030 (prompted by an advertisement proclaiming 'the future is now'), he encounters a user-friendly library computer (personified by Orlando Bloom) with a real sense of humour and humanity.  When Hartdegen asks about time travel, the library computer even incorporates Star Trek gestures and sound effects into its discussion (as well as the yet-unwritten musical version of 'The Time Machine', by Andrew Lloyd Weber).  One woman in the distant future speaks English (now called the stone language, for the stone engravings that remain from store fronts and the like), but speaks without accent (strange enough, but even stranger that New Yorker Hartdegen sounds more British, as does the Morlock leader Jeremy Irons).<br /><br />Indeed, there are so many little pieces here is seems that the writers spent more time trying to incorporate bits of cleverness throughout the script than making sure the script as a whole had thorough soundness.<br /><br />Another piece I really liked was the music.  The sombre brass tones, the triumphant orchestral arrangements, the folk/modern synthesis for the Eloi, and the dramatic scoring really enhanced this film beyond measure.  The DVD has bits of the score that replay on a loop sequence during menu screens, and I've sometimes left these on to hear the pieces over and over again.<br /><br />The DVD has one of the better menu sequence set-ups I've seen, simulating the machine effects in visuals and sound, as well as incorporating score elements and special effects.  DVD extras include the delete scene, commentaries by many of the crew, several pieces on the special effects (including one on the time machine itself),<br /><br />This is a fairly good film, despite its flaws.  Overall I would award it three-and-a-half stars, but will round up to four in honour of the effects, the music, and clever pieces., the triumphant orchestral arrangements, the folk/modern synthesis for the Eloi, and the dramatic scoring really enhanced this film beyond measure.

B000AQBA1W|5.0|Jean and Gerry Corr were two 1970s amateur musicians from Dundalk, County Louth (Ireland) who performed traditional Irish music alongside covers of songs popular at the time. The couple's four children later grew up to become one of the best-selling sibling acts of all time, combining rock and roll with traditional Irish elements such as fiddle, tin whistle, and bodhran. After fifteen years of worldwide success, the quartet known for their pop tunes and ballads has returned to their roots to give fans a taste of home - their home.     The Corr siblings (Jim - guitar and piano; Sharon - violin; Caroline - percussion; Andrea - tin whistle and vocals) perused their late mother's Irish songbook and recorded some of her favorites along with tunes they cherished while growing up. While each song featured on the album is exquisite, some simply stand out:    'My Lagan Love': The album's opening track is the epitome of Irish ballads, combining pining lyrics with a beautiful yet tragic melody. The story of love and longing near the River Lagan (which flows through Belfast), it is as much a song capturing the spirit of Northern Ireland as a traditional tune.    'Heart Like A Wheel': \\"It's only love that can break a human being and turn him inside out,\\" sings Andrea on this tender piano ballad. Beautifully performed, it is at once uplifting and heart-wrenching.    'Buachaill On Eirne': The band once commented in an interview that they did not remember much Gaelic from their school years, but upon listening to \\"Buachaill On Eirne (Boy From Ireland)\\", one would hardly know. The track is heartwarming, full of exuberant energy and tender lyrics, performed in the Emerald Isle's first tongue. Without a doubt, my favorite tune on the album.    'Old Hag': During the last fifteen years, the Corrs have toured the world, sharing traditional Irish jigs with audiences from Sydney to Singapore to San Francisco. \\"Old Hag\\" is such a jig, easily danceable, and an instrumental that will have youclapping along as if you were sharing a pint in a Dublin pub.    After four best-selling studio albums, the Corrs have gone back to their roots with \\"Home\\". It's a record filled with Irish charm and heart, and from start to finish there isn't a bad track. Each song has been tenderly recorded, and each of them will capture your heart, giving you a taste of the Emerald Isle the band calls Home.
B000AXSN5G|5.0|Well I can't give this album 6 stars, but I would like to.  Are there any musicians who have lasted as long as Neil Young and still produced good music?  I don't think so.  I've listened to so many other claims as to what might be the \\"Best Album of 2005\\" or \\"Best Album of the Year\\", but they all fall short compared to this album.  Neil Young is heartwarming and yet melancholy, passionate yet detached in this album.  It is easily the best album of the year, and possibly one of the best albums I've ever listened to.  For someone like me, who has become so disenchanted with modern \\"rock\\" in any form, country rock, hard rock, whatever the hell, it really takes an amazing album to make me return to any music that has guitar.  Leave it to Neil Young to bring me back to reality.  For a work of true genius and pure emotion by one of the greatest musicians of all time, go get this CD and enjoy it as much as I have.  I could go on and on, but for those who have short attention spans, I will end this review here.
0823016714|3.0|The book is really well made but has a major flaw, it's organized by age, resulting in more than half of the models being old, overweight and most of their facial features are very far from the artistic \\"ideal\\". Bad model casting in my opinion I would rather have actual actors not only the facial expressions would have been more natural and not so overdone but they would also be much closer to the ideal face, it's easier to adapt a photo-model face to a round face than doing the opposite. I have no problems with everyday people being used in book but I wished that they were about 15% of the models and not ~80%, the other ~20% are good to great models and they should have been the majority, I really liked Sallie Glaner expression gallery for example, it's what the book should have been all about, great expressions that you can apply to all characters. There's also no kids models or babies I think they would have been a nice addition to the book. Another negative aspect is the size of the pictures compared to the really low printing quality, it's a bit hard to read the photos.   None the less it's a very interesting book and I will give great use to it, I really liked about 3 of 4 models in the book and they make the book worth it for me, it has other sections that are very useful too like the skull in varies angles, the hats and accessories section, the kissing, phonemes...   Hopefully it will sell enough to catch the attention of other publishers and this time investing more in high profile models like actors and photo-models and better printing. I understand it's always hard being a pioneers and it's easier to make mistakes early on so I thank the author Mark Simon for the very thoughtful initiative of doing a book like this.
0671891634|4.0|When Peter S. Lynch speaks, wise investors will listen.  This book covers the famous fund manager's career at the helm of Fidelity Magellan from 1977 to '90, and post career into '92.  It's far more introspective than \\"One Up On Wall Street\\" and it was no doubt meant to be for this purpose.  For example, there isn't nearly as much fundamental principles for stock picking outlined in this book as the former.  My belief is that the reader would do best by reading \\"One Up On Wall Street\\" first and follow up with this title, as its the newer of the two, regardless.  <br /> <br />Peter's style of writing (with John Rothchild) is no-nonsense and easy to take in.  To my knowledge three books have been published by the duo and all three have been entertaining and never dry.  The reader can comfortably take in some very important stock-picking principles from one of the greats without feeling intimidated at any point.  I think this is a sign of a well written book that covers a topic that isn't child's play (unless you like playing with money). <br /> <br />And although this book doesn't cover nearly as much technical information as the first, it still offers a lot of tasty tidbits for stock pickers.  I made plenty of notes while reading \\"Beating The Street\\", and I'm confident that I'll be well served by doing so.  Peter reiterates many of the guidelines he mentioned in his first best-seller, such as scrutinizing company earnings and the balance sheets, and he gives his wise opinion of picking bargain stocks that have lower P/Es than their growth rates. <br /> <br />Overall, this title definitely deserves four stars, and his first book deserves at least five stars.  Lynch and Rothchild have authored several investing books that will stand the test of time. You'll sleep better with your investment decisions by having these valuable classics in your collection. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />   <br />

B000BW7QWW|5.0|For me, Serenity was one of the most anticipated movies of 2005.<br /><br />I had been a fan of the series Firefly shortly after the DVD release and eagerly awaited the films release. Like millions of others, I was immediately drawn into Joss Whedon's show that included characters with realistic emotions, thick and overlapping plots and a great sense of humor, all of which are rarely seen in sci-fi let alone any type of television. With that being said Fox (as they have done so many times before, latest victim: Arrested Development) prematurely canceled a great series. Fortunately, the sole season of Firefly, along w/ unaired episodes, was released on DVD in 2003 to overwhelming success. And that's how we get to Serenity.<br /><br />So much was left unsaid in the series finale, so many questions were unanswered. Although it would have been a nice way to go, the last show was more of a sign of this that COULD HAVE come rather than a sign of this TO come. With Serenity, the basic premise of Objects in Space is expanded all throughout the Firefly 'verse in a 120 minuet epic that should exceed any fans wildest expectations.<br /><br />Serenity has everything a fan of Firefly could ask for and more. The story is so emotional, especially in the final 25 minuets, that it feels as if Firefly never left.<br /><br />You will be reminded of the first line in the show's theme song all throughout the movie as the story (for now) come full circle.  Also, Serenity features the return of the most ruthless and sinister creatures in the universe...\\"Mine is an evil laugh!\\"

B000002UAR|5.0|A lot of people will probably agree that this is some of the Beatles' best work. The introduction of new instruments into rock (string quartetts and the sitar) and the exploration of new sonic textures bring the personality of these tracks alive. But the most important things, as I can see in this album, are consision, cohesion and completeness. These were made possible not by drugs however, but by the maturity of the Beatles' approach.    This is the last Beatles album where the songs followed these standards in the 2 or 3 minute pop-song tradition. The difference, however, is in the quality and depth of the musical ideas themselves. While \\"I wanna hold your hand,\\" and \\"She Loves You\\" are fun and dancable numbers, Revolver's tracks show an effective skill at quickly and simply conveying a range of emotions. \\"Love You To,\\" is an urgent song about the fears of life ending before the chance to enjoy it. \\"I Want to Tell You\\" achieves an unusual effect by combining affectionate lyrics with music that almost borders on the ominous and fearful. The gloom and heaviness of a church cemetary is conveyed perfectly in the pulsating strings of \\"Eleanor Rigby.\\"    Proably the most unusual song, however, is \\"She Said She Said\\". It opens with its theme on a solo guitar, a theme that guides the entire song. It is a song that both musically, and lyrically, asks a question and leaves no answer. \\"She said I know what it's like to be dead . . . and shes making me feel like ive never been born . . . Even though you know what you know, I know that I'm ready to leave, cause youre making me feel like I've never been born.\\" This song supposedly was inspired by an LSD-intoxicated conversation between Lennon and Peter Fonda, who said these things to Lennon, making Lennon feel strange and uncomfortable with staying. The listener is confronted with the same ideas in this song, and as Lennon sings the theme one last time in the words \\"She said,\\" it simply repeats, and the song fades away, leaving the question unanswered. In two minutes and thirty four seconds a simple theme has become a haunting reminder of a question that we are afraid to ask ourselves, and one that continues to echo in our memory long after the song has ended.    The Beatles would not remain creative in this way for long. They would go on to break many barriers, to introduce the bizarre and unorthodox into rock, and to open the floodgates for a new revolution of drug music. This can be seen even here, on \\"Tomorrow Never Knows.\\" However, although some people would disagree, I see this as a decline rather than an awakening. \\"I am the Walrus,\\" \\"Helter Skelter\\" and \\"Revolution Nine ('No. 9')\\" are striking and powerful songs, but they do not have the masterful craftwork of the songs on Revolver. It would be a tragedy to think, as I know many people do, that the creativity and expression of Revolver can be attributed to drug intoxication. On the contrary, it was the muddled miscommunication in the band that was influenced by this drug use for the most part, a practice that helped to ultimately end the band's career. It was not their drugs that made this album possible, but their spirit. This spirit helped them grow from the four moptops they used to be, albeit helping them become the four stoners. Even the coincidental role of LSD in \\"She Said She Said\\" was used in a mature and creative way, not a way that indulges an \\"anything goes\\" shock value a la The White Album.    Revolver remains a tribute not to the opportunities that the celebrated subatances opened for these four musicians, but for the ones they closed.
B00001OH7O|5.0|This is the first Bowie album I bought. After that I ended up buying almost all his albums, but I must say that none of Bowie's other albums(except maybe Ziggy Stardust) had the impact this one had on me. When listening to songs like \\"Oh you pretty things\\", \\"Life on mars\\" or \\"Changes\\" I couldn't help but wondering in what fantastic \\"musical world\\" Bowie was living in 1971. Some songs on this album are extremely beautiful and show Bowie's undeniable genius. This album will not leave you indifferent, you'll remember it for the rest of your life. I also think it's not a bad introduction to the Bowie catalogue, it will leave you so amazed that you will want to own every Bowie album (next step is Ziggy Stardust) or at least that's what happened to me. Go buy it, it's worth the money.

B00005JO1Y|4.0|After embarking on the LORD OF THE RINGS movie adaptation project - director Peter Jackson did an excellent take on re-doing the mythos of the best-ever 1930's monster flick King Kong, repackaged with modern day special effects and production for the silver screen. Indeed a whole hell lotta improvement from the previous original Dino De Laurentiis bore-fest remake from the 70's with Jeff Bridges (which spawned a number of sequels, both official and no), I guess with those digital effects that at times just looks so artificial, it would've never been that effective if not for Peter Jackson's directorial prowess - that made it possible for them to incorporate a lot of other giant monster, insects, dinosaurs and creatures - which are originally incorporated anyway to te original idea of Skull Island where Kong reigns supreme.   This time, it however is a peculiar occurance on me that the lady-in-distress and object of Kong's affection is played by not only a convincing but a very attractive actress who's really quite perfectly fitting for the role (and again a lot of improvement from Laurentiis' take back in the 70's featuring Jessica Lang in the role as one named Dwan (perhaps having Sissy Spacek being casted then would've made much of a difference I guess)that being only 5 years old, my older brothres would tease me out for what that i didn't know of), when it turned out to be Naomi Watts! Again prior to watching the flick I've avoided previews and reviews 'til I watched the film myself -- and what peculiarity there is it's that I always find Ms. Watts incredibly attractive... gorsh , I'm drooling.    I've seen it in the cinema on some digital stereo - dunno if its on DOLBY DIGITAL as the lady in the ticket booth indeed said when i asked, but the sound effects are enough to be the one worthy for the academy awards.     However this rendition of Kong is a great move for director Peter Jackson, whom prior to the LOTR series is one whom I personally have on my lists amongst great movie directors above Steven Spielberg.    Marvellous.    (Just a viewers prattle on what he felt about the flick though)  RATE: ('') ('') ('') ('') (' = 9 0ut of 1O

B000023X9W|5.0|En mi opinin, no entiendo porque este disco est tan poco valorado. Sin ninguna duda es de lo mejor que hizo Neil Young en los ltimos aos. Canciones como \\"Distant camera\\", \\"Buffalo Sgringfield again\\", \\"The great divide\\" merecen ser escuchadas con atencin. Una cancin que nadie tiene en cuenta y que est entre mis favoritas es \\"Horseshoe man\\". <br />Sin ningn lugar a dudas este album merece ser escuchado.
0800141601|4.0|For movie buffs that have been brought up on the usual chronicles on the legend of King Arthur, the story of this movie would be a digression. While the other stories center on Arthur, his conquests and his governing his subjects, this movie's story focuses more on the Guinevere's ambivalence towards Arthur and Lancelot; to some this may be a storyline unheard of. <br /> <br />Guinevere is sent to Camelot to marry King Arthur. Her party is attacked on the way by Malagant (called Meliagaunce in the legendary stories ); and Lancelot, now a wayfarer, saves her. She then reaches Camelot shortly before Lancelot reaches there. As fate would have it, things happen to make them meet and come together. Now, she is in a very sensitive position - her heart is torn between her love for Arthur and her attraction towards Lancelot. What happens then forms the rest of the movie. King Arthur, played well by Sean Connery, is much older than Guinevere. Lancelot is played by Richard Gere. <br /> <br />The battles, sword fights, chases on horsebacks etc, are well choreographed and shot. In fact they help keep the pace and the realism of the movie, considering the fact that not much of and about castles or keeps are shown in the movie. <br /> <br />It has a planned story line, believable role play by Sean Connery (King Arthur), Julia Ormond(Guinevere), and Ben Cross (Prince Malagant who is always dressed in black to denote that he is the antagonist); well shot chase/battle scenes, and an admirable musical score by Jerry Goldsmith. Speaking of music, all the theme music in this movie are wonderful, to listen in the movie, or listen as they are, removed from their context. All in all it is a movie worth watching and appreciating.  <br /> <br />If you ever get a chance to see it I recommend it. Great for vacation watching.
B00005JOIF|5.0|Steven Spielberg again strikes a raw nerve in his somber tribute to his Jewish heritage in \\"Munich\\". He recounts the massacre of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics by the Palestinian terror group Black September.  Using archived film clips from news reports of the terrorist attack he creates a graphic portrait of the horror generated by this event.  Using a clever cinematographic technique his color film appears to be more a colorized black and white, a washed out, toned down version of the vibrant color schemes seen in todays films.<br /><br />Eric Bana, previously seen playing Hector in \\"Troy\\" gives a career defining performance as low level Israeli Mossad agent Avner Kaufman.  Bana is recruited through the highest channels of Israeli government including prime minister Golda Meir to administer revenge for the Olympic attacks.  Bana is separated from his family and made head of a five man assassination team to execute 11 Palestinians identified as being responsible for the attacks.  He is officially made a non entity in Israel so that his actions can have deniability.<br /><br />Included in his team among others is Daniel Craig playing British accented Steve.  Bana is handled by his Mossad contact Ephraim played nicely by Geoffrey Rush.<br /><br />The plot lead us through the machinations Bana and his team have to go through to accomplish their mission.  They are assisted by a family of Frenchmen lead by the distinguished Michael Lonsdale who provide information for exorbitant fees as to the whereabouts for their targets.<br /><br />Spielberg presents a fairly unbiased view of these events also evoking sympathy for the Palestinian cause.  Bana's character in the film, Avner goes through a metamorphosis. his psyche ultimately in turmoil due to guilt and the paranoia of his position. He and his family leave Israel to settle in the U.S..  We realize that although he is beseeched by Rush to return to his homeland, things can never be the same for him there.r him there.
B000AP04FG|2.0|I've had high expectations for this film for so long now. And what happened? I was disappointed. Not with Angelina, she was fabulous as always, but Brad pulled the whole film down around him.<br /><br />This is basically True Lies, but without the greatness that was True Lies. Even down to the tango dance scene. But while True Lies had terrific action scenes from the start, this film starts with marriage counselling (much like in When Harry Met Sally), and Brad comes across as really stupid. It drags most of the way through, broken up with lots of shoot outs, and a highly unbelievable car chase section.<br /><br />There's something about Brad that I've never got. Every other woman out there swoons whenever he appears, but there's just no appeal there for me. Just a wee bit in Thelma & Louise, but I've never felt it in any other film. He's just too clean cut, but I can see why he may have been enticed for Angelina. Who wouldn't? But his character, and now him in real life, is unlikeable. He's lost whatever magic he used to have that every other woman could see, and I can't.<br /><br />Angelina only just about saves this film, and although it's not one of her best, it's still good to watch her. The girl knows she's hot as hell, and can do just the simplest thing to make a guy or girl swoon. I'm straight, I have a boyfriend, but if Angelina was offering ... Whereas Brad knows too damn well that women think he's sexy, and it's gone straight to his head. He's so cocky it's unbelievable.<br /><br />There's a few tongue in cheek jokes, but the only one I really got was the fact John Smith mentioned he'd been married once before, in Vegas. Angelina & Billy Bob did get married in Vegas. I think that's what it meant, although it maybe me jumping to conclusions.<br /><br />Vince Vaughn appears in what looks like an extended cameo, and he's irritating as hell. I don't know what's going there, but his character was pointless, and could have been written out quite easily, and never been missed.<br /><br />There's no real ending to this movie, and you're left with the feeling that there should be something more, with the Smiths shooting at nothing, and not getting hit at all. Some of the action scenes can come across as quite dodgy, especially when John Smith gets stabbed in the leg, pulls it out, with barely a grimace, and then runs. Uh huh of course.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this film, unless you're an Angelina fan, and willing to sit through a not great film just to watch her. If you're that desperate, then sure go ahead. Just don't say I didn't tell you. Thankfully I didn't pay money for this. I got it as a Christmas present. Ask for it as a present, and you won't end up being disappointed.g to this movie, and you're left with the feeling that there should be something more, with the Smiths shooting at nothing, and not getting hit at all.

B000BNX3B4|2.0|If you're in the mood for another assembly-line written girl-meets-boy, girl-loses-boy, girl-and-boy-bumble-around-for-a-bunch-of-scenes, girl-and-boy-get-together...then, this is the movie for you.  Despite John Cusack's charm, Diane Lane's canned delivery, and Stockard Channing's ever-lovability the film never really lifts off and, at times, is down-right embarassing at times, and amusing occassionally.  The scene where the two lovers go looking for condoms should be nominated for some kind of Golden Raspberry award for screenwriting...\\"Dopiest Scene\\" or some such thing.  No surprises, a couple laughs and lots of overwritten scenes.  Sigh.
0307276902|5.0|I am an avid reader.  This is absolutely the best book I have ever read.  Mr Frey writes from the heart with honesty.  This book is a vital portrait of a remarkable man and his  revealing depiction of his decision to confront his addiction. I cried, I laughed and I totally agree with his approach. James Frey is a man of extraordinary courage and honesty.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|I'm so happy Mariah has once again risen with this instant classic, The Emancipation of Mimi. It's just so great how just two years ago she was proclaimed a \\"has-been\\" and now she's once again on top with this (so far) 5x platinum album which received 8, yes 8 grammy nods!! If the grammys are smart, they'll give Mariah close to all of them. (I'm hoping she really gets Album of the Year!!) Let's go through my favorite tracks: <br /> <br />It's Like That- Amazing start to the album. A classic party song yet not as good as past up-tempos like \\"Heartbreaker\\" or \\"Fantasy\\" 4/5 <br /> <br />We Belong Together- the gem of the entire album. The most played song ever and the biggest song of 2005 AND Mariah's entire career with an incredible 14 weeks atop Billboard's Hot 100! Everything from the melody to Mariah''s sad vocals make this a very convincing tune. She truly outdid herself here. 5/5 <br /> <br />Shake It Off- Perfect r&b jam...I love the last part of the song when Mariah really lets loose. 5/5 <br /> <br />Mine Again- the other ballad on the album. All I can say is WOW!!! She really shows what she can do with her voice here. 5/5 <br /> <br />Fly Like A Bird- outstanding track with a gospel feel to it. Love it! 5/5 <br /> <br />Don't Forget About Us- Mariah's 17th #1 single atop Billboard's Hot 100. Reminiscent of \\"We Belong Together\\" yet stands out on its own. 5/5
0307276902|5.0|I did not think anything James Frey could say after the first few pages of his book would make me feel more of his pain. Then he sees the dentist. I was gritting my teeth, gripping my mouth with one hand, and flipping the book with the other. I had to read his recount of the procedure in very small doses. And we still have detox to go through! <br />His style of writing is different. The use of capitalization and punctuation. He is repetitive.  If you are OCD, hang in there. After reading a few pages, I understood his writing, and was able to stop fixing everything. <br />Mr. Frey's story is surreal. You will feel the need to tell yourself, `this can not be true,' so you can continue reading. It is true. He leaves nothing for the imagination. It is all out there. He takes you, not only through his recovery, but back to the beginning at the age of ten. He does not agree with the 12 step, Higher Power program. Instead he proves there is another way for him. When he test himself, you are terrified he will slip. You will find yourself saying, no no no <br />You will meet the other people in rehab and become involved in their recovery. The statistics will astound you. I was glad he wrapped up their lives for us, both tragic and triumphant. I do not believe you could talk to anyone who has been through rehab and they would say anything other then, truth truth truth. <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever made.  A great space classic that fans of Star Wars and/or Star Treck will enjoy. <br /> <br />About the person complaining about bad video quality, I suspect he got a damaged DVD. The picture quality on this movie is incredibly good. <br /> <br />IGN a respected media reviewer says the picture quality on this DVD is as good as in the theater version wich is excellent.
B000AA305M|4.0|This is a disc my step son got for me - and I really enjoy it a lot. It's not hard to understand why - an earlier reviewer who suggested Rufus Wainwright meets Jeff Lynne got it right. For boomers, this means an melody - and an eerie similarity to Paul McCartney Chaos and Creation - especially on the first song Alibi. I suppose that may or may not be a good thing, depending on the listener - but for me, it provided an aural anchor, allowing me to bear the repeated listenings required to allow the songs on this disc to unfold \\"glacially\\" as an earlier reviewer said. I look forwrd to more listening!
B000065PUE|3.0|I bought two older 90s albums: No Pocky for Kitty by SuperChunk, and this album on 'huge 5 star ratings' ...well, typically this is my kind of music, but I don't feel they hold up to 5 star ratings, which is why I'm rating this album sort of lower than usual, to offset the balance of the dark (idiot) side.   <br /> <br />I was introduced to this sort of melodic pop/punk by being an avid fan of The Wrens - and whereas the lyrics are fantastic for the aforementioned band's albums, the lyrical quality of the Pixies is on par with Nirvana's \\"an albino, a mosquito, my libido\\"...y'know, rhyming for the sake of syncopated vocals, and nothing to write to Mom about.
B000BYY0RY|5.0|I first ordered this DVD from amazon.com and was disappointed when it didn't ship right away. Then someone on Kylie's official forum said that Canada's cdplus website had NTSC versions in stock, I canceled my order and went through that site instead. I actually saved a lot of money ordering directly from Canada instead of buying from the US and having to pay an import cost.<br /><br />The show is absolutely amazing from the opening song of \\"Better the Devil you know\\" to the last song of \\"Love at first sight\\" (Fever version).Kylie has redone a lot of her songs to give them a fresh sound. There are so many highlights for me. The beginning of \\"On a night like this\\" is so beautiful-it's sounds like a  ballad and then goes into the normal dance version in the second verse. This is the first time I've ever heard Kylie sing \\"In Denial\\" and the dancer that dances through that one through \\"Confide in me\\" is amazing, I believe his name is Jason Beital(sp?). \\"Confide in me\\" is also given a makeover and it is so great. It's probably been the song that I've watched the most. Kylie and Jason perform a little dance in the middle of \\"Confide in me\\" that is one of my favorite parts of the whole show. \\"Over the rainbow\\" is of course one of the highlights and the image of Kylie on the moon is gorgeous. \\"Come into my world\\" is also perform while she's on the moon and it became a beautifil ballad. \\"Dreams\\" is finally performed in full for the first time and it's really worth wait. That is one of Kylie's most powerful songs ever and when I listened to it the day that Kylie announced she had breast cancer, I got teary-eyed.  \\"Hand on your heart\\" also got a make-over and the mix of it is really great sounding and it'll get stuck in your head-not that that's a bad thing. \\"Loco-motion\\" continues to be jazzy-sounding but it's different than any other version that she's done. I prefer the \\"Fever\\" live version better but this one is great as well. \\"I should be so lucky\\" sounds almost exactly as the 1987 version and the dancers perform it in sign language. \\"Especially for you\\" is another highlight with the audience joining in.<br /><br />All of the songs are great and there isn't one dull moment in the show. The \\"Behind the Feathers\\" documentry is a great highlight and it's fantastic to see some of what goes on behind the scenes. There is a small clip on there of Kylie talking about her tour family that was filmed, I believe, on May 2. This is where a member of the band, Chris Brown, proposed to his girlfriend. I kind of wished that they had shown the whole clip because it sounds like it was a really sweet moment. This DVD is a must for any Kylie fan and hopefully everyone will be able to get their copies soon. There's talk of Kylie finishing the tour in 2006 and she might slight alterations to the show so there's something to look forward to.<br /><br />\\"Keep believing in dreams!\\"7 version and the dancers perform it in sign language. \\"Especially for you\\" is another highlight with the audience joining in.

0060578793|4.0|I purchased this book based on the reviews and have not been disappointed! The book has 572 pages of useful information. It covers a wide breadth of topics as well! After witnessing the aftermath or hurricane Rita in Houston on the unprepared, I have found this book to be a great resource for getting prepared and having the proper mindset. Don't just read it. Pack it in your survival kit if possible![edit 8-28-06] Ok, now I've been through hurricane Katrina and now Ernesto is threatening Fla. or the Gulf region. Everytime I open the book, there is something new that I discover in there!
B0000C9V3T|5.0|I love the soundtrack almost as much as I love the movie.  It's so good.  Only Tarantino could come up with something so ingenious.  The music is great - especially the old, eclectic mix of old forgotten songs.  Bang Bang and The Lonely Shepherd are so good on this.  The RZA stuff is good too, and he uses everything on here in a dramatic way.  His choices are so fitting to each scene they are used in.  What a weird, brilliant and deliciously twisted mind he has.  This is the best.
B000A6CLL0|5.0|Let me begin by saying I am a huge \\"Trek\\" fan. I own every movie and television show on dvd, and I realize that it is a big no no, but of all movies, shows, etc... this season is the best of all. The ongoing story arc is brilliant, yet the individual shows plots and character developments are never forced and add to the tension of the final showdown. If this season had been viewed by all the fans who gave up after seasons 1 or 2 the show would never have been cancelled. Fantastic job by cast and crew. Great forsight by the writers to plan and execute to perfection a 24 episode thriller.
B000000YG5|5.0|I'll weigh in on the Rollins vs. Coltrane issue.  When I first discovered jazz 30 years ago I fell under the Coltrane spell.  I couldn't get enough of him, wore out two copies of Live at the Village Vanguard.  As I got older I began to prefer the clarity of ideas, mastery of rhythm and melodic storytelling of the great Sonny Rollins.  Now there is no contest.  I agree with those who believe that Sonny is the greatest improviser of the last 50 years, or more.  Every cut on Saxophone Colossus is a jewel.  Blue 7 was famously analyzed by musicologist Gunther Schuller as a model of almost architectural structure in improvised music.  I prefer to think of it as melodic storytelling.  Nobody does it better than Sonny Rollins.  This record is one of the finest in jazz, in 1956, now or 100 years from now.
1594200653|5.0|I have to chime in and agree with the numerous reviewers who have bemoaned the lack of footnotes and bibliographical citations in this book.  I'm sure that Tony Judt and his publisher didn't take the decision to adopt such radical departure from the academic norms lightly, but the choice is simply wrong, and lamentable.  Steering readers towards a website that contains the missing footnotes seems foolish and naive: yes, it, in the short term it may fill in the blanks and will save many trees from the pulp mill... But what is the likelihood that this website will still be online in five or ten years?  Rather slim, I would think.  And though future versions of the book may include either the missing footnotes, or some other technological fix, this original edition will be judged flawed and incomplete for years to come.  A pity, since it is a major historical work, and quite satisfying in all other regards.
006054094X|5.0|Gavin Menzies has shaken the world of history like no one else in recent years with a radical new theory: that the Chinese discovered most of the world between 1421 and 1423 and that in the process were responsible for a vast number of hitherto unexplained historical anomalies that previous theorists have attributed to everything from ancient Atlantis to aliens from outer space.  Now while this has the singular advantage of better satisfying Occam's Razor, which can perhaps be most usefully stated: \\"when you have two competing theories which make exactly the same predictions, the one that is simpler is the better\\", it needs to be stated that Menzies uncovers no \\"smoking gun\\", no single piece of evidence that proves his theory.  Instead he accumulates a mountain of circumstantial evidence (of admittedly varying quality) and attempts to prove his case by sheer weight.<br /><br />Despite the hysterical reaction by an embarrassing number of historians (who are starting to make ranting Evolutionist responses to Creationism and Intelligent Design look scientific by comparison) there seems little doubt that Menzies' theory is PARTLY correct.  There also seems little doubt that some of his interpretations of some of the evidence are flat out wrong, as his critics gleefully point out, acting as if they've proved something.  But with a circumstantial case like this, calling into question 1 or 10 or 50 of his points doesn't discredit the rest.  Menzies is clearly trying to provoke additional research into the subject, not prove every single one of his assertions correct.  He doesn't mind if you approach his theory full of skepticism as long as you do so with an even partially open mind.  This is clear on his web site (somewhat obviously 1421 dot tv) where he not only details theories so questionable he left them out of the book, but also encourages people to watch a documentary [[ASIN:B0002IQNF6 1421 - The Year China Discovered America]] that first presents his theory and then savages it.<br /><br />There's not much question who has the more open mind or the more scientific approach between Menzies and his fiercest critics, and there's also not much question that the Chinese got further around the world than current historians are willing to admit.  The question is just how much further, and hopefully after they've finished venting, Menzies' critics will get to work researching it, too.<br /><br />Note: since it contains updates, corrections, and revisions, you will want to pick up the paperback [[ASIN:006054094X 1421: The Year China Discovered America]] rather than the hardback [[ASIN:0060537639 1421: The Year China Discovered America]]; however, the appendices have been substantially reworked with some information dropped entirely so if you can find a hardback edition in good shape for a bargain price, this is one time it might be worth getting both.it.

B0007GAERG|2.0|Firstly I must confess a few things. I think that Ms Carey has a beautiful voice. Ever since hearing her on 'A vision of you' (not sure if this is the correct title) I was blown away with her vocal range.<br /><br />Secondly Ms Carey, like a lot of today's artists, doesn't sound a lot different to what's out there.(J-Lo, Christina Millian, etc...)<br /><br />There are some nice moments on this CD: shake it off is a nice song to bounce/ party to, sung well. Sprung has a great retro vibe to it, that, once again, is sung well, and a great party record.<br /><br /> The remainder falls into a bracket of `featurings', with Nelly (To the Floor) Twista (One and only) and Snoop Dogg (the awful say somethin'), and one-dimensional ballads.<br /><br />I feel that Ms Carey has to decide what she wants from her career. I feel that if she wants to look back on a body of work, which will stand the test of time, and cement her place in music folklore; she needs to go against the flow, and take some risks, and drop the hip hop drop-ins,  that dilute her work. With a voice as good as hers is, it would be a shame, and a waste.
B000BO0LLS|4.0|As a person who enjoys music, I'm always looking for a variety. I scan reviews of albums. I prefer to read reviews from those who have purchased the album, and actually listened to it.  <br /> <br />It's quite immature yet laughable that the same kid (YES A KID WHOSE PARENTS NEED TO MONITOR HIS INTERNET ACTIVITY) floods Amazon w/ nonsensical, irrelevant reviews.  <br /> <br />Anyways, here's a track by track review of The Emancipation of Mimi: <br /> <br />It's Like That-Fast paced song which helped Mimi land back onto the MTV fan base. Jermaine Dupri does a superb job producing, cutting, and making this track what it is. However, it couldn't have been done w/o Mariah's solid voice. Clearly celebrating emancipation. 4/5 <br /> <br />We Belong Together-Who hasn't heard this song? It was rightfully her comeback #1 hit. A great R&B song...that I suprisingly say is TOO short. Again, classic Mariah ballad. 5/5 <br /> <br />Shake It Off-Hmmm, unlike Mariah. Clearly, she made this song to be accepted by the mainstream public. Usually Mariah doesn't dress up 'Gangsta' in a music video...however...I'm not reviewing the video (which is good btw). The song is very hot, fun, and 'in your face'. 'This one and that one, by the pool, on the beach, saying, hold up, my phones ringin' up, Im gon' hang up and call da machine right back...'. 4/5 <br /> <br />Mine Again-Well, all I can do is sigh. This had potential to be a great, great Mariah ballad. However, she doesn't ballance the song. She had to prove she doesnt' whisper, and she still has her class 90's Mariah voice. However, the whole song is basically a high note. 3/5 <br /> <br />Say Somethin-Funky track w/ Snoop Dogg. Very fun, and sounds retrospective to the 70s with a modern touch to it. It's very fun to listen to. 5/5 <br /> <br />Stay The Night-Ultimately the best track on the album. Of course, this was produced by Kanye West. The song is balanced, perfectly cut and sang. Great production. Too bad Mariah over looked it asa single. 5/5 <br /> <br />One and Only feat/ Twista-This is a great song; again, unlike typical Mariah. However, it's always great to be innovative. She sings really fast, and you have to consult the lyrics printed in the booklet to understand what she is singing. However, her and Twista did great together. 5/5 <br /> <br />Circles-This is a great ballad. This is much better than Mine Again, however, it sounds like a Mary J. Blige ballad reject. 3/5 <br /> <br />Your Girl-A short, three minute song. Mariah brought in a unique choir to help her with the chorus to give it more spunk. Great track, which again is too short. 5/5 <br /> <br />I Wish You Knew-This is a great ballad. Not as good as Cirlces, however, it's a 'Bringin on the Heartbreak' part 2. 4/5 <br /> <br />To The Floor-My least favorite. I'm not fond of Nelly, so he therefore spoiled the track. 2/5 <br /> <br />Joy Ride-Sounds like a Baby face song. The chorus is great and it sounds like Mariah's 1995 'Melt Away'. I love the song. Mariah's high note at the end gives the impression that it's gonna be completely great, until the last second of it...where it sounds like her voice snapped on her. 5/5 <br /> <br />Fly Like a Bird-This is a great song w/ great high notes evenly distributed throughout the song. The choir does it's part, and it's very uplifting. 5/5 <br /> <br />Don't Forget Abous Us- MARIAH's 17th #1 Single! WOOHOO! This song doesn't sound like We Belong Together as many claim. This is a slower, more R&B originated song. This song is much better than ANY of her singles. It's a shame she didn't put it on the first release of this CD...she therefore wouldn't have had to re release it. 5/5 <br /> <br />Makin It Last All Night-This is a fun song w/ Jermaine Dupri. His rap is comical, yet spunky. 'Listen, I got stacks like the International House of Pancakes'. 4/5 <br /> <br />So Lonely-One and Only Part II. This is a great song, which was also on Twista's latest release 'The Day After'. However, it's not good as One and Only. The chorus is fun and catchy never the less. 5/5 <br /> <br />We Belong Together Remix-OMG can you say disgrace? Sorry Mariah, but they shouldn't have touched this song. It's obvious they did your 1999 'Heartbreaker' remix which was decent, but you should have left this track alone. 1/5 <br /> <br />Overall Score: 4/5 <br /> <br />Also check out 5 of my picks: <br /> <br />Michael Jackson-Dangerous <br />Whitney Houston-Whitney <br />Janet Jackson-The Velvet Rope <br />Alanis Morrissette-Under Rug Swept <br />Mariah Carey-Butterfly

0446577383|2.0|I have never read Baldacci before, and have no plans to in the future after reading \\"The Camel Club\\". The only reason I even bothered to finish it was at the insistance of a friend who loaned it to me.  I am eternally grateful that I am not lamenting having actually spent money on it. <br /> <br />Reading \\"The Camel Club\\" is akin to grading the essay theme of an English lit major finishing in the middle of his class.  His descriptors are just laughable.  The main character of a homeless man turned ex-special forces killer reluctant hero just does not ring true.  There are so many improbabilities and outright proposterus scenarios that one just throws up the hands for any sense of reality.   <br /> <br />There are no adequate words to describe how bad this book is.  Check it out at a library, or borrow it from a friend.  Stuart Woods is more entertaining.  Tom Clancy is more intellectual and detailed.  And Steven King is more compelling.  Given Baldacci's published successes, he cannot be as bad as \\"The Camel Club\\" makes him appear.
B000000OTY|5.0|This is the CD to own, by far. I can listen to it a million times and not be sick of it.  Peter Gabriel is a musical genius, infusing his unique sound with world music influence, most notably singers and percussion from Africa. And his lyrics are intelligent, not your standard pop/rock. I always enjoyed Peter Gabriel, but this CD incorporates all the elements into the best versions of these songs I have ever heard.  \\"In Your Eyes\\" alone is worth buying this CD.  I own the DVD of SWL as well, which is incredible in itself, but unfortunately cuts off some of the best parts of certain songs - like a young Paula Cole shaking the tree with her incredible voice.  I can't say enough about this CD, except do yourself a favor and buy it.
B000002MIY|2.0|When I first got this CD I thought it was quite good.  Actually, the more I listened to it the less I liked it. Maybe, it was just what I was going through at the time...But, I listened to it again recently and only really like 3 songs.  Florida Room,  Snowbound, and On The Dunes.  The rest of the tunes are okay, but this isn't Steely Dan.  Save your money and buy Aja, The Royal Scam, or about anything else from them.
6305428271|5.0|The storyline of Dangerous Minds is undoubtedly conventional. Former US Marine (Michelle Pffeifer) joins the teaching profession with oodles of idealism, hoping to mould young minds. The rest of the film proceeds to show the challenges she has to surmount to win over a group of underprivileged, mostly black kids, and to convince them that they have options in life. The plot has the potential to be very tired. That's why this DVD sat on my shelf for years, and I never had any incentive to pick it up. When I finally did, the film surprised me with its powerful, emotional acting and characterization. It also imparted some good values without coming across as preachy. In terms of depth, it was also much better than Mona Lisa Smile, or Music of The Heart (both of the same genre). All in all, highly entertaining, feel-good film which unlike most Hollywood movies, also imparts a dose of good values.
B00070Q7VO|3.0|Their isn't much I can add to the numerous reviews that were written before this one.  Yeah, he's got a great voice, he's a crooner.....and so on.  I just wish that they would let this guy sing some more original songs.  Most of us are tired of remakes.  I know it's because the studios and copyright holders make money...but, all that being said...HOME is the best song on this CD. I bought it for that song only and really don't care about all the remakes.
B0002J4X1Q|4.0|It seems that one cannot swing a dead cat without hitting a zombie these days.  In this ultra-modern zombie flick, Milla Jovovich plays Alice and takes a train down the rabbit hole to battle human and dog zombies and an evil computer, the Red Queen (off with her head!). <br /> <br />This is one of those love-it or hate-it movies.  I loved it.  This is one of the best game-based movies out there.  Sure, the zombie thread is standard fare (a virus causes a zombie plague and a group of people fight to survive), but there are good special effects. <br /> <br />The movie is very fast-paced, mindless and filled with action, good sound effects and soundtrack.  Not surprisingly, this movie is quite violent and depicts a lot of gore.   <br /> <br />On the extended DVD, there are some interesting extras.  I thought the piece on the makeup for the Zombie Dogs was fun.

B00079018K|4.0|Why is everyone complaining about the copy-protection that Sony had to slap on so people won't steal the music? I agree that Sony doesn't need to do this, and they are being idiots. It's not like they're going bankrupt; far from it, actually. With all of the PS2s and TVs they've sold, and the PS3s that will sell like hotcakes in the future, it's not like they're in debt. And if they are. that's not our problem now is it? Sony doesn't realize that the drivers it secretly installs can be stopped by holding the SHIFT button down when you insert the CD into your driver. Gosh, people, look at the reviews for the Velvet Revolver CD! It's also available on iTunes, so you know...This is supposed to be about the music reviews? So let's get on with the reviewing as I review this great album, Kasabian.    MY REVIEW  __________________________    I first found out about Kasabian through 'word of mouth', though the words spoken weren't nessecarily good ones. [...] My friends and I are in love with The Strokes, and somebody attacking Julian Casablancas, Singer/Songwriter for The Strokes infuriated me. I figured I'd listen to some of this 'crap' just to spite it.     I hate it when I'm wrong. Kasabian is a great album by a great band. I, too, am a fan of the Madchester scene, when bands like The Stone Roses and Happy Mondays were still around. The days just after my all-time favorite band Duran Duran entered its '...wow.' period, and the days just before my all-time favorite band Blur entered its '...wow!' period. The revival of said scene has led to bands like The Killers and Bloc Party, while bringing the return of great bands like Depeche Mode and Duran Duran. One of the bands coming to this great 'new New Wave' scene was Kasabian, mixing the personality of Oasis with the musical talents of Blur (Think Tank period). When they finally released an album, many Oasis fans and Blur fans...and fans of every band inbetween was pleased.    'Club Foot' is a great opener with a booming bass line accompanied by heavy vinyl-esque drums and an Liam Gallagher-like-singer whose...'confidence' can be sensed in his vocals. 'You can't take control of me...you're messing with the enemy' are only a few lines of this great song. 'Processed Beats' is another good song, but the chorus gets on my nerves. Its okay, though. I loved 'Reason Is Treason'...until it was featured on everyone's favorite show, the show that clearly makes every band mainstream , 'The OC'. Honestly, why is that show still on the air? 'I.D.' seems like it could fit in a soundtrack very well, it's dark and deep.    'Orange' is just a transition/it's sort of a filler song, the end of the song is the beginning to  'Lost Souls Forever' which was used in the movie 'Stealth'. It's a great song with vintage sweeping synths and distorted drum beats. From then on we have 'Running Battle', whose title doesn't really fit the song. Let's just say it's not the fastest song, but it's okay. 'Test Transmission' is a song filled with little bleeps and bloops. From then on we have funny little 'Cutt Off', slow and heavy 'Butcher Blues', new-waveish 'Ovary Stripe', all leading up to the 10:50 long 'U Boat', starting off with an odd sound effect and then a swirly synth with Tom's edgy vocals. Guitars come in at about the one-minute mark, but the song doesn't kick in until 2 minutes, with a great tambourine effect.    I think this is a great debut album and would reccomend it to any fans of this type of music. Try it out, you'll probably like it.
B000058983|5.0|Years ago when I picked up a book that ranked the best albums of all time, I had a great shock when I found this album at #1.  Could it possibly be better than the #2 \\"Pet Sounds\\" or even the #3 \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\"?  Fueled by a combination of curiosity and utter disbelief, I decided to get the cd and lo and behold, I was blown away.<br /><br />The music was unlike anything I had ever heard before and it was obvious from the start that this was a very original work of art and that Arthur Lee was a brilliant genius at work.  It became clear to me as well that \\"Forever Changes\\" is very deserving of its lofty ranking.  A simply beautiful album and probably as close as pop music has ever come to being high works of art.<br /><br />Now this version has been very well remastered and for the diehard fans, 7 very interesting bonus tracks have been added.  As a guitarist myself, I personally found the track in which Arthur Lee chastises his guitarist for playing only in one range of the guitar to be the most insightful.  The guitarist, clearly rattled, goes on for a second take which Arthur pronounces as great work but if you listen closely is clearly compositionally and musically not as good as the first solo that Arthur panned!<br /><br />Yes, it was a lot louder and was full of hammer-ons and pull-offs and what guitarists call cliches full of sound and fury but really nothing much in terms of substance (he even plays a couple of wrong notes that are clearly out of key) but I was amused to see Arthur impressed by that and the guitarist giving him what he wanted even if it was musically inferior to the first solo.  It was to me, a clear lesson in delegation and empowerment and letting people who are expert at what they do do their own thing.  Highly recommended.
B000AYQJJ2|5.0|This is a two-disc package that includes an extra disc of special features that really gives a fuller picture of what this groundbreaking concert meant to the performers and to the audience at the time, because the special features include straight-to-the-point interviews, and they give you the sense of what an immense undertaking this concert was for George Harrison and how important it was for all involved (and for the world, because he really showed how every person can use their resources to make a positive impact if they have sincere good intentions).  Also, if you have seen the video version of this concert you will be greatly pleased by the quality of the sound and the visuals.  Some of the things that really jump out at you are Billy Preston's enormous talent (which The Beatles and Rolling Stones recognized, having brought him in as a keyboard player on occasion), Leon Russell's natural rock n' roll artistry (he really fills the room and brings a pure shot of rock n' roll joy to the intense proceedings), and most of all, there's George, whose exquisitely structured guitar style provides an understated yet dominant framework to the music.  Also, this is the best live performance I've ever seen by Bob Dylan, who shines while blending in perfectly with the seriousness of the matter at hand (remember, he played at Martin Luther King's \\"I Had a Dream\\" speech at the march on Washington, D.C. - he always seems to be there when it counts).
B000002UJQ|1.0|\\"Greatest Album of the 90s\\" huh? when there are no good songs or memorable melodies, it's definitly a problem. The problem I have with most Radiohead's work is it's just not catchy. I beleive that music IS music, that means there must be more to just lyrics being sung by the singer. There has to be a chorus, a verse, a memorable melody. Music is ENTERTAINMENT, listning to this album make me want to vomit, it's just not music. Because music is supposed to be catchy with a melody and a chorus. Tell Radiohead to include a chorus in their songs and a memorable melody then maybe I'll give their work a second thought.

B000002H97|5.0|This is a great cd and if you like rock or metal you should get this cd
B00005NGZX|4.0|Like their previous (and following) works, Converge's eighth album, 2001's \\"Jane Doe,\\" is super hard to describe and even more difficult to categorize. It is a very meticulously constructed, emotional, complex, and dissonant record which sounds more like cats in a blender than actual music. Don't get me wrong--it is still very memorable, but not because it has radio-ready, tuneful, hooky songs. The fiery, relentless, pounding guitars and absolutely sick drumming (by Ben Koller) make the rhythms flattening and not very pleasing to the ear. What separates Converge from the rest of the math metal/noisecore pack is the vocals. Even in those all-too-rare moments when the guitars are metalcore-esque (i.e. tracks six, nine, and ten have chugging riffs), Jacob (Bannon)'s tortured, atonal, very high-pitched, monkey-like shrieks make \\"Jane Doe\\" unique and almost deafening. Tracks two and eleven, \\"Fault And Fracture\\" and \\"Thaw,\\" best illustrate Ben's insane, all over the place, careening drum work, and \\"Distance And Meaning\\" has machine gun snare drums. Other highlights include the explosive riffs and crashing drums of \\"Concubine\\" the pounding guitar chords and cracking snare drum on \\"Bitter and Then Some,\\" and \\"Heaven In Her Arms,\\" which has a strong, propulsive guitar lead throughout. These songs are pretty much all the same, because the only real attempt at actually having a rhythm comes during song number four, \\"Hell To Pay,\\" when the song begins with soft guitar strumming, before becoming a catchy, galloping rhythm. \\"Jane Doe\\" is certainly not for everyone. If you enjoy catchy, accessible songwriting and arrangements, you'll have absolutely no luck with this album. And if you want a C.D. that you can sing along to and hum in your mind all day long, you'll definitely have to look elsewhere. But if you like mathcore and/or listen to bands like Norma Jean, Dillinger Escape Plan, Meshuggah, Black Dahlia Murder, and/or Burn the Priest, and if you want a mind-scrambling, brain-melting sonic assault, then you've bought the right C.D.melting sonic assault, then you've bought the right C.D.
B000089RVX|5.0|I first heard My Immortal on the car radio, and thought `wow, who was that?' At the time I was convinced it was some new English folk-influenced act: I was gobsmacked when a friend told me that Evanescence were an American metal band! Later, I saw the equally impressive Bring Me To Life video and realised that this was the same band I had heard on the radio. <br /> <br />I've bought many albums on the strength of a couple of songs, and frequently been disappointed. Not this time! Fallen passes my acid test for a true classic album - the natural tendency to just put it on and press the play button - no thought whatsoever of track selection. There really isn't a duff moment: thunderous riff-driven, but melodic rock, with portentous classical flourishes (I sense a debt to Tony Iommi here); timely changes of tempo and dynamics with two beautiful piano-led reflective ballads (My Immortal and Hello); thought-provoking dreamlike lyrics, Amy Lee's dramatic Celto-Gothic persona, and all the time those incredible vocals - sometimes ethereal, sometimes searing and soaring above the mix. <br /> <br />Despite its dark, minor key, symbolic and brooding themes, this album has the apparently perverse ability to lift my mood (witness the several thousand people with grinning faces mouthing the words 'I want to die!' along with Lee each time the band perform Tourniquet live!) The best new music I've heard in the last five years, it's never out of the CD player for very long. I can't wait for next year's follow up, but am seriously troubled by the effect on the songwriting the sad departure of Lee's collaborator Ben Moody might have.
B00000JCB2|4.0|When Limp Bizkit released \\"Significant Other\\" in 1999, they were not only very popular, but almost everyone thought they were a promising young band who showed real, credible songwriting skills. Now, I'm not a Limp Bizkit fanatic, but the truth about this album is, if you listen to it with an open mind, you should realize it is actually pretty good. Gratuitous profanities and self-absorbed lyrics (which littered later Limp Bizkit releases) aren't present, here, and some songs (like \\"Re-Arranged,\\" \\"No Sex,\\" and \\"A Lesson Learned\\") have introspective lyrics which are actually pretty mature! Plus, in addition to being very catchy and somewhat exciting, \\"Significant Other\\" has a variety of songs, so it covers all of the bases. \\"Just Like This\\" is a nearly danceable intro track, while songs like the infamous \\"Nookie,\\" \\"Breakstuff,\\" and \\"I'm Broke\\" are quite mean, energetic, and heavy. \\"N 2 Gether Now\\" is a full fledged rap song (with a guest spot from members of Wu Tang Clan), \\"Don't Go Off Wandering\\" is somewhat creepy, \\"Show Me What You Got\\" is a kiss-off which seems made to get the mosh pits swirling, and \\"A Lesson Learned\\" is a very slow, depressing, partially a capella ballad. This might not be saying much, but \\"Significant Other\\" is Limp Bizkit's finest hour. It's a good album, it is arguably rap-rock at its finest, and it actually proves that Limp Bizkit know how to write a few good songs. So you have my approval to go ahead and buy this album (especially if you have Nineties nostalgia)...just don't tell any of your friends.
B00008WT5E|5.0|This is a classic rough, edgy, hard in your face Bon Scott and the boys hard at work with their down to earth in your face blues on the edge. It to me is their last album that was raw before they became more comercial with Highway to Hell, Back in black and For Those about to Rock. A must for anyone who appreciates the late great Bon Scott! My very first album ever bought and still one of my favorites. It is hard and heavy blues with a mean streak. You gotta have it!
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|When I was studying in Europe 2 years ago i heard this band for the first time, they were known by a few but considered as a great \\"experiment\\" by actor Letto. I just bought their second cd and i think it is great, excellent if i may say so. I am impressed and I highly recommend \\"Attack\\", \\"Beautiful Lie\\", \\"Was it a Dream\\" and \\"From Yesterday\\". A must have!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Whether you claim yourself to be a faithful 'browncoat' or if your response to that statement is 'my winter coat is blue', Serenity is most likely going to entertain you.  I myself had never seen nor heard about the story of Serenity before watching the film in theaters, but it caught my interest so much that I purchased the series Firefly that very night.  Now that I have seen the series and the movie once again, I have to admit my understanding of the film has skyrocketed.   <br /> <br />For the avid fans, this is a solid representation of Firefly and it appears it was an easy transition.  Every element that is loved by the fans - the wit, the relationships, the smart action - is embedded in Serenity.  Then again, if you are an avid fan, you already know this. <br /> <br />For those, like me, who have no idea what all this jargin means I think you will still enjoy the film.  Granted, you may be 'ignorant' of the significance of many of the events that occur, but that shouldn't prevent you from being entertained.  You may even end up like me - leaving a positive review after committing hours of watching Firefly the series and Serenity multiple times.
B000002IAS|4.0|When I initially heard this the moment it came out I loved it having seen Cream in '67&'68 and following Sir Eric through his many changes since 1966.  This is the best you can get mixing the country/blues styles of Delaney & Bonnie with the rock/blues/soul of Clapton.  And Bonnie can really belt it out as she does on many of this CD's numbers.  I love that the backing band are the Dominoes who hadn't officially formed yet.  I wish that this could be remastered and re-released as the entire show and maybe even a DVD because I have a copy of the Denmark show which is fantastic!!
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Enough with the griping of other reviewers.  When I saw the television version of this film I was surprised when the song \\"When Love Is Gone\\" appeared.  I didn't remember it from the theatrical release.  Now after listening to Brian Henson's director's commentary I know why.  The song was cut from the widescreen theatrical release because the movie was running long.  They added it to the television and video release, the pan-and-scan version. <br /> <br />Don't blame Disney for giving you exactly what was produced.  Just sit back and enjoy a wonderful movie that has been part of my holiday tradition for years.  Now excuse me while I go and enjoy Pepe's profile of Gonzo, one of the bonus features.
B000B8QEYC|4.0|For Enya fans there is always a long wait between her albums. This album does not disappoint for die hard fans, and if you are new to Enya's sound-this is a great place to begin an Enya collection. Soothing relaxing and wonderful music to play during a dinner party or winding down on the way home from work. Lush, celtic and ethereal sounding, Enya's voice will take you away often in two languages, Gaelic and English. It's what I have always loved about her sound and nobody else really sounds like her. On Amarantine Enya sings in Loxian, an invented language instead of Gaelic.<br /><br />I sometimes think Enya and Nicky Ryan get too carried away with all the overly complex overlays and now the Loxian language type of stuff. I still go back to and often play Shepherds Moon from 1988, which for me is still by far her greatest album. Though the lush ethereal sound is there, so is Enya's clear, strong, Irish voice which is magnificent without all the overlay and that's more apparent on Shepherds Moon or even Watermark. Those albums really combine that trademark Enya sound along with some celtic inspired sounds and that is what is missing somewhat on this new album. Playing around a bit with her sound wouldn't hurt Enya, and maybe even going back some to her Clannad roots. But Amarantine will not disappoint, this is a solid Enya album and very enjoyable.
B00005JO9J|1.0|No way would I be caught dead owning this DVD set, or even watching this series. I can't believe that Touchstone/Buena Vista is rushing this to market (on Valentine's Day, no less) but are still stiffing us by not releasing the far superior Season Three of \\"Once And Again\\" (originally scheduled for 1/10/06, now indefinitely postponed.) In fact, Buena Vista touts \\"Once And Again\\" in the press release for the DVD set of \\"Grey's,\\" while still stalling on releasing the third season of \\"O&A\\" on DVD. Hypocrisy in the extremus, if you ask me. (You're reading this review, aren't you?) Come on Buena Vista Home Entertainment. Get off your high horse and give us quality DVD, not this twaddle. If you want to see a real medical show, drop what you're doing, and write or e-mail 20th Century Fox and ask them to release the last five seasons of \\"St. Elsewhere\\" on DVD.

B000002KIE|5.0|<br />\\"I dont get it\\", said John, \\"all we want to do is destroy everything.\\"  <br /> <br /> <br />This is my first Amazon review. I am just trying to do my part in straightening out all the rubbish that is connected with the Sex Pistols. In my 17 short years on this earth, I have tried to make some sense of possibly the most misunderstood word, movement and musical genre ever; Punk.  <br /> <br />Okay, first of all I'll begin by stating all the reviews of this album have to be of the lowest standard out there (as this album is so widely known and so limitly understood correctly) and the word poser appears a couple hundred times to many. I'd like to clear up a few things aswell. Yes, this album is fairly simple musically, like most punk bands debut albums are, but, also like other great punk bands (and probably more so in this than any) you can sense something greater than any complex chord progression can achieve, and you get a hint of great things to come and a taste of something higher than talent. Obviously the Pistols didnt have great things to come as a band, for reasons to complicated to go into now (try \\"The Filth and the Fury\\"), but the Clash ceertainly did (also the Ramones and Bad Religion) and that sense is equally as abundant in their classic punk rock debut, and look how talented they became. I believe it to be complete resentment that enables absolute individual creativity to arise, and that was what English punk was all about.  <br /> <br />With all the lies that circulate around this band, im going to try to work as best i can with the facts. Punk doesnt start, nor end with the Sex Pistols, but they did play a major role in shaping it. No one can claim to have 'invented' Punk as music isnt invented, it evolves.  <br /> <br />The sound is obviously derived from rock 'n' roll with The Stooges being the first band to be clearly different (released their debut in 1969). Then came the first wave of 'punk', from America a few years later; New York Dolls,Richard Hell and The Ramones. I consider the Ramones the most 'punk' of these as their music is more stripped down raw rock 'n' roll than the rest. If you were to say one band invented punk it would definetly be the Ramones, as they had already released two albums by the time most other Punk bands had released any.  <br /> <br />Then came the UK Punk, which I consider of higher standards than the American Punk. It was also in the UK I believe that whole 'punk image' was created, by 'the Johns', John Lydon and his friends (all named John). With their American influences (apparently Punk kicked off in the UK after the Ramones toured there) a band was formed by angry working class boys who called them selves the Sex Pistols. And the UK Punk movement began, and an explosion of anger was release upon a very, very unprepared world.  <br /> <br />This is as clearly as I can put my understanding of Punk as a genre: there are two types, English and American. American came first but was quickly drowned out by the English scene. The English punk was more openly angry and quite more juvinille than the Americans. The two biggest bands from both scenes would be the Ramones from America and the Pistols from England. The Ramones were about taking everything bad in their lives and celebrating it, with their 'bubble gum' tunes, and the Pistols on the other hand, were about taking everything bad in their lives, finding the source of it, then absolutly offending the hell out of it. These are both Punk but in quite different ways. Both bands (and scenes) were fed up, both were angry youths, both were legends and revolutionised music and the world.  <br /> <br />The major thing that seperates the two scenes is their image. The Ramones were nothing new really, but the Pistols... they were something brand new indeed. As I stated earlier, the punk image in London was initiated by the Johns. Malcolm Maclaren and the pre-Lydon Pistols were looking for a head man and spotted John and asked himto audition, he agreed and after the audition was accepted into the band. John Lydons individual way of thinking, and utter hatred, was what sparked his unique image and song writing abilities. And the rest is history, the Pistols changed the world, sparked the punk movement in London and continue to influence bands nearly 30 years later, now not many bands can claim that.  <br /> <br />Now, from what I have read and viewed, the Pistols were just another band before John joined, so to say he made the Pistols, I dont think is too far from the truth, just look at what happened to them after he left. I really think John influenced the rest of the band a lot, becasue i know he has greatly influenced me, and many other bands have stated he influenced them too. All this talk of Malcolm making the Pistols is nonsense, Malcolm didnt make anything, even 'his' shop was directed by Vivian Eastwood.  <br /> <br />Being born 15 years after the punk movement, it was hard to understand it, but the brilliant documentary, 'The Filth and the Fury', helped, a lot. The state of England in the 70's was only 100% clear after viewing this, and this has helped my value the Pistols a lot more. From the rage that was built up inside them from basically everything around them; the 'fake' pop bands, the government and the royal family, came a semi-unique sound, but energy that is unparralled by anything i have ever heard before, and since.  <br /> <br />I like the Clash, a lot, and the Buzzcocks and the Ramones and Bad Religion, but while i think the music of the Clash is far superior to the Pistols, the sheer power of the Sex Pistols is overwhelming and i think it is that, that will always keep me coming back for more. Its clear the Pistols were not brilliant musicians, but they were young and still learning. Glen had probably the most talent, which is why even after he left the band, they still hired him as a session player.  <br /> <br />The Pistols were some-what about provoking, but mostly i believe they were about promoting change, becasue obviously they were fed up with the old way. In John's book, 'Rotten: No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs' he denys the Pistols ever being nihilistic, which i can totally undestand. 'God Save The Queen' is by no means nihilistic, 'Anarchy in the UK' is some-what, but thats the provokotive genius of John Lydon. For me the thing that makes the Sex Pitsols so much better than the rest, is that they sound so different, especially Johns voice.  <br /> <br />Now, to hate something, first you must completly understand it. All these one star reviews are obviously by kids hooked on the pop tones of Good Charlotte and Simpley Plan, who obviouly dont understand the first thing about what Punk is, or what it means to be Punk. There is no point asking people to stop one-star-reviewing becasue there is no stopping the stupid.  <br /> <br />So you can drop the rating on here all you like, because seriously, it means nothing. Everybody who loves this album understands the brilliance of it, and everyone who doesnt like it, doesnt understand it at all. But if your just looking to get into the Pistols, or Punk in general, start with the greatest, probably the most influencial and inspirational album ever created. I have listened to these songs countless times and have done the same with The Clash's and Bad Religion's albums, but everytime I come back to the Bollocks, I wonder why I ever left.  <br /> <br /> <br />\\"They were only in existance for 26 months, only ever released one album, but they changed the face of music forever...\\"  <br /> <br />-  <br /> <br />[...]
B00005JKC3|4.0|I just watched this movie yesterday--because I liked Ang Lee's latest _Brokeback Mountain_. I have another motivation: people have been saying that _The Hulk_ is the one of the worst movies ever made, so I wanted to see how bad that was.   <br /> <br />Then it turned out that this movie is not only entertaining, but also thoughtful. This movie, I personally believe, elevated the status of the comic to something meaningful, which means that \\"ordinary\\" people like us can relate; it touches on a dark desire that we want (?) to resist. It seems that \\"desire\\" is Ang Lee's theme; if you look at his filmography, it is quite consistent. Every movie of his deals with the conflicts as well as unexpected heroism one's desire creates.
0307276902|4.0|After hearing so many good things about this much-hyped book, I checked it out from the library to see what the fuss was all about. I thought it was pretty good; it held my interest and it was a fast read. I did get a bit bogged down in the middle of it since it was the same thing over and over again. Still fascinating though. <br />My major complaint is that (although I have no experience with addictions/rehab centers), many things in the book rang false. Would the airline really let an unescorted guy in Frey's condition board a plane (supposedly with the help of a doctor)??? Would the rehab center really put up with his BS and disrespect of the rules??? Not to mention Frey and the couselor going to pick up Lilly in the crackhouse. And the Mobster asking Frey to be his \\"son\\"? I just can't picture that happening. Conveniently enough, nearly all the main characters in the book are now dead and unable to say what really happened (except the counselors, which by law I'm sure are unable to comment on past patients). <br />But, if you're able to take this book with more than a grain of salt, you might find it's a fascinating read.
B000B0WODA|5.0|Yes, you have heard this band. The single Take Me Out from their 2004 self-titled debut has been everywhere. If you watched almost any sporting event in the last year you heard this Scottish band's big song. It also showed up in all kinds of other places, anywhere that needed a catchy music bed. When your band takes off and you are forced to tour non-stop and find a way to do a follow up it is usually a formula for a big let down on the sophomore release. But the boys with the skinny new wave ties were having none of that! In fact, this album is better than the first.  <br /> <br />Right out of the gate they lay it down, \\"So they say you're trouble boy / Because you like to destroy / All the things that bring idiots joy / Well, what's wrong with a little destruction?\\" In a guitar buzzed, hook filled salvo titled The Fallen the band just kicks into full gear and doesn't let up for six tracks. Do You Want To and You're The Reason I'm Leaving will have you bopping and singing along all day. When the band does slow it down they do so with great effect. The two slower songs, Eleanor Put Your Boots On and Fade Together are wonderfully crafted and serve to bring balance to the disc.  <br /> <br />The real reason this disc is so good is that Franz Ferdinand has learned to more carefully craft their songs. The first disc had lots of songs that abruptly changed direction in mid-stream. Sometimes this worked to perfection (Take Me Out) other times it was a bit jarring and disconnected. Those mid-song changes still occur but they are far less over the top and thus the disc as a whole feels better and works together more effectively. If you like the retro 80s movement in music then this disc should be at the top of your new wave list.
B000002NG7|4.0|8 years after, looking at this album and the career of Faith No More in general still causes me to get a little choked up. I was devastated at that press conference when Billy announced they were splitting. Faith No More was easily one of the top 2 or 3 best bands of the 90's, and it was sad to see them go. Enough weeping, however, let's get into the review. <br /> <br />This album as a whole has a very plodding, exhausted feel to it. One can ascertain the general feeling that these guys are sick of each other (Mike Patton didn't even rehearse with the band, instead turning in his vocal tracks by mail while working on Mr. Bungle's spectacular 1999 release California) and that they know this is the last straw. The songs still stand up on their own, for the most part, and it is still light years more coherent and cohesive than the lackluster 1994 release King For A Day, Fool For a Lifetime. The whole album lends a feeling of distance, of space, a stunning shift from their previous walls-of-sound performances Angel Dust and The Real Thing. Jon Hudson's guitar work is mediocre, yet there are moments (Ashes to Ashes being the most prominent) where his simplistic efforts really enhance, rather than detract, from the material. For a hardcore FNM fan, this is nowhere near their finest material, but for the rest of the industry, it stands head and shoulders above what was available at the time, and in fact still stands taller than most of the material released in the 8 years following.  <br /> <br />The album begins with a bone-jarring syncopated semi-trash number, Collision. While fully loaded with raw power, the overall emotive value of this piece wears off quickly once the initial headbanging is over. No notable lyric here, it's a very sparse hint at a book and movie done a short time before. Stripsearch is a powerful bounceback, both lyrically and musically. Flowing, ethereal textures and incredibly emotive vocal passages, with lines such as \\"In these days - I'm breathing stone - crying stone - I'll win this race - I'll leave alone - arrive alone\\" place this piece among the best this band has ever produced. The radio-ready \\"Last Cup of Sorrow\\" is a flop. Dead, lifeless, unimaginative, boring - frankly I was shocked such a great band could produce such a piece of crap, and then have the gall to release it as a single over some of the real gems on this record. Chalk that one up to the industry pushing a band to re-write its big hit over and over again, as if forcing the same sound down people's throats repeatedly will make them love you. \\"Naked in Front of the Computer\\" brings back the dark humour that has been such a beloved component of this band's sound for years. Jon's opening riff is lackluster, but the song ignores it and moves on into a frantic, aggressive underpinning for some very tasty lyrical gems such as \\"In how many ways - and words - can you say nothing - millions of ways - and words - to say nothing\\" - all a sarcastic stab at the internet revolution and its evolving into what is essentially a forum for dolts such as myself to foam at the mouth to whoever will listen. \\"Helpless\\" is a spectacular quasi-ballad piece with dreamy synth passages, although again weighed down by Hudson's lack of imagination and skill. Quips like \\"For every wish, I wonder why - Why all I want is something beautiful - A place to rest\\" toss the listener rather casually into serious depression, while the eerie whistling and other sound effects hint that the band is laughing at your pain all along. \\"Mouth to Mouth\\" brings more tongue-in-cheek silliness and a brilliant hook \\"I can dress up the dead man - but I can't bring him back to life.\\" Too bad they didn't drop this surefire hit on the general public. \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" is definitely another T-10 alltime FNM piece. Patton's soaring vocals interplay beautifully with Roddy's boards, and Hudson's 14 note guitar solo actually makes for a perfect interlude between segments. The hook is stellar - \\"Smiling with the mouth of the ocean - and I'll wave to you with the arms of the mountain - I'll see you\\" and passionate, one of the few genuinely emotional pieces on the album. \\"She Loves Me Not\\" is a forgettable effort at a show-tune, with Roddy masturbating on a his grand piano patch and Mike desperately trying to bail the song out with some mindbending vocal texturing. \\"Got That Feeling\\" is an ambitious compound time-signature nu-metal piece, which is great if you're a nu-metal band, but rather unfortunate if you're the band who wrote one song that started the whole bloody genre. \\"Paths Of Glory\\" is powerful, grandiose piece with a surprisingly strong hook riff from Hudson and some stunning lyric to support another soaring, intense vocal performance from Patton, with shreds like \\"Is this the only path of glory - If so then I won't go alone - Follow the trail\\" grabbing the listener by the throat and demanding attention. \\"Home Sick Home\\" is a grand little dark-flavored swing piece that could be likened to a Charles Manson comedy tour. Ponder that visual for a minute. \\"Pristina\\" is a beautifully sparse final movement for the album, evoking precisely what I have to believe the band intended - this is it, folks, it's over, we're done. \\"In every dark land - in every flower bed - in every marraige bed - I'll be with you - I'm watching you\\" - what's left to be said? <br /> <br />Overall, a fine coda to a spectacular career for this band. It's completely unfair, really, to hold it up to the standard of Angel Dust - no band in the history of heavy rock has ever managed to eclipse their masterwork ex post facto, why should we expect FNM to have been any different? Still, it stands up on its own and demands to be accounted for in the annals of alt-rock history.
B0009H1CKG|4.0|Stop!  If you don't have the Mothership Connection DVD, I highly recommend buying it first.  Perhaps I'm too old school but, in my opinion, the Mothership Connection DVD captures PFunk at their peak and the Live At Montreux DVD captures PFunk as they are now.  That said, if you already have the Mothership Connection DVD, the Live At Montreux DVD compliments it nicely and both are must haves for your PFunk collection.  Live At Montreux has outstanding performances and it captures everything that you expect to see/hear when you go to a PFunk concert nowadays.  However, my favorite part of the Live At Montreux DVD are the bonus tracks.  It is worth buying the Live At Montreux DVD if only for Bernie Worrell's synth solo and Michael Hampton's performance of Maggot Brain.  Regardless, I must emphasize buying the Mothership Connection DVD first if you don't already have it.  I just feel it is a superior concert.
0517123207|5.0|Many people assume that Darwin's initial account of natural selection is so out of date that it is to be avoided in favour of more recent text books of evolutionary theory. While it is true that huge gains have been made in the one and a half centuries since the first publication of \\"The Origin\\", there is nothing in this work which is wrong. Darwin was too good a scientist and too cautious.<br /><br />Some claim that Darwin admitted of the possibility of Lamarkian mechanisms. They have not read the original. Darwin knew nothing of the molecular basis of genetics, but knew that natural selection did not need a Lamarkian mechanism. He simply did not rule it out, although he found it improbable. Everything that is stated in this great classic is as true today as it was at the time of first publication.<br /><br />It is also said that Charles Darwin was a lesser intellectual when compared to most other great names of science; that he was a plodder, a naturalist, a sort of gentleman stamp collector who pressed flowers into his books and barely a scientist in the contemporary sense. This is nonsense. Darwin was one of the giants of rigorous systematic thinking; the kind of rigorous thinking and critical attitude that asks the right questions and provides the capacity to answer them. Let me buttress this claim with one example.<br /><br />At the end of chapter six Darwin noted that the theory of natural selection could not account for structures or behaviors found in one species that exist solely for the benefit of another unrelated species. In setting out the theoretical terms for the refutation of the theory in this way, he anticipated Karl Popper, that analytical non-nonsense philosopher of science, by more than a century.<br /><br />I recommend you read this book with an attentive curious analytical mind. You will find yourself walking in the footsteps of an intellectual giant.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|Treated myself to Takk after reading rave reviews and it is without doubt THE CD of 2005. Lush, powerful, emotional, ethereal and unlike anything I have ever experienced before. Enchantingly beautiful tracks just wash over you. Glosoli is an epic masterpiece which I bet Brian Eno wished he had written. Such was its beauty, that it left me shocked to the point of tears. <br /> <br />An absolute must-buy and please, please do not let the Icelandic lyrics put you off. They do not distract from this beautiful CD.

0679422714|2.0|It is hard to assign one number to a book like this.  The good points are that it is thorougly researched, and many years in the making.  On the other hand, it is horribly one-sided.  The spite and pure hatred positively jumps out at you from the first page.  I don't see how anyone can write a good biography with that. <br /> <br />Books like these are also hard to review because most of us aren't Chinese history experts, and can't really comment on the accuracy of their data.  Here are two reviews written by historians.  [...] and [...] <br /> <br />Their views agree with my intuition that Chang and Halliday stretched their data to fit their (most likely her's) very strong  idea about what they wanted to write.  They also make much more damning statements about the quality of their research, including the poor system of citation, use of endnotes, and inaccurate representation of anonymous sources.  This should be verifiable, and if it is true, I would recommend that this book be tossed into the garbage can. <br /> <br />The theme of the book is laughable.  The theme is: <br /> <br />Mao is both grossly incompetent, slothful, hated by all AND became unquestionably revered in China.  How is this possible?  This is the overarching assertion in the book, but it is simply too unlikely to be true.  They might as well have titled the book, \\"Mao: The Luckiest Man To Ever Live\\".
B000002H70|5.0|What can i say about this cd that has not allready been said ?
B000301YY8|5.0|It's hard to find an unknown artist debut like this. Every single song is listenable and highly recommended. I was amazed when I first saw \\"you're beautiful\\" video, and I realised that it was time to buy the album. Thanks God I did, now I can't stop listening Back to Bedlam over and over again. <br />1- High (4.5/5) Touching the fifth star, but something's missing. Great opener though <br />2- You're beautiful (5/5) The reason for getting this LP. Simple and awesome, but overplayed <br />3- Wisemen (4/5) Different...it's kinda groovy, what makes it a clear upbeat. Interesting overall <br />4- Goodbye my lover (5/5) Best song without a doubt. It's so beautsiful and deep that you can even imagine James' soul singing it acapella. This MUST be the next single <br />5- Tears and rain (4.5/5)Meaningful. Lay down and enjoy with this wonderful ballad thsat grows on you <br />6- Out of my mind (2.5/5) No one is perfect. Just don't get used to this one <br />7- So long Jimmy (3.5/5) Another groovy track. It's not as good as \\"Wisemen\\" <br />8- Billy (4/5) I like the piano part after the chorus <br />9- Cry (5/5) Wowwww this one blows me away. Slow but brilliant <br />10- No bravery (4.5/5) Good way to end this great album
B000BMSTMS|5.0|I`ve been a Hard Rock fan since i was a child back in 1976 when i got turned on to Kiss and from that day on i have loved Metal/Hard Rock/Rock Music and will forever. That being said i got on board the korn bandwagon in 1998 when i heard got the life off ' follow the leader' and than like all the times i fell in love with a band that had allready been a band on the rise I went out and bought the 1st and 2nd cds and have seen them live 3 times. So I must say this new cd is BRILLIANT and most of all interesting, heavy, wierd and very good...cant wait tell they play in SF in 06..... Some of my Favorite rock bands are The Cure,Pantera,D.Mode,Audioslave/Soundgarden/Rage,Mudvayne,Metallica,Rolling Stones,The Beatles,Deftones,Sabbath,Rush. To name a few......GREAT JOB KORN !!!!!!!!!!! GO PATRIOTS !!!!!!!!
B00005ASHM|5.0|Mike Love snidely commented that all this music was silly, superfluous and egotistical- he accused Brian Wilson of recording his own selfish \\"pet sounds\\". Does that mean Love, the self-loving dweeb, named the album?<br /><br />It is this type of nonsense that really takes people's attention away from the greatest album ever recorded. Wilson, perhaps too deeply inspired by the Beatles' \\"Rubber Soul\\", outdid them all. And they were well aware of it. Aside from John Lennon- the only other worthy apart from Wilson- the Beatles spent the rest of their days trying to barge into Wilson's universe.<br /><br />I grew up with \\"Pet Sounds\\", in a way, because I did not have a chance to hear it at first, but heard some of it in 1970. If you do not feel moved to tears listening to \\"God Only Knows\\", then you are not human. And that song nearly got canned because no one had ever used the word \\"God\\" in a song like that. Funny, because it sounds like it came straight from the Big One in the Sky.<br /><br />But this music came from the mind of Brian Wilson. It cannot be classed, described or degraded in any way. What I can say is that everything I've heard since has a taste of Brian in it somewhere. Even the original \\"Goth\\" music found its origins in \\"Pet Sounds\\". And people from Philip Glass to Peter Gabriel have copied Brian.<br /><br />So buy the thing and try to experience what we did when we heard it new- and don't forget that about 97% of the music at the time WAS crap.
B000244FDW|2.0|I have to say that I'm puzzled by the overwhelming support of this adaptation of Jane Austen's book in the face of more recent--and in my opinion, better--adaptations.  Having seen all versions of P&P that I could legally get my hands on, and being a huge fan of the book and its author, I found this version of the story flat and uninteresting...and, dare I say, boring. <br /> <br />David Rintoul had the makings to be an excellent Darcy, but in the end, his performance is a disappointment.  If there is any character development happening here, I must have missed it.  Rintoul struts around the film with a ramrod-straight back and absolutely no emotion or sensitivity; if I had not read the book I would have wondered how Elizabeth possibly managed to fall in love with him.  Granted, Austen focuses very little on the emotions of her heros, but this detachment does not transfer well to screen -- whether Austen addresses it or not, the character of Darcy must change from the first proposal to the second, and this is something the production team of the '95 BBC adaptation understood.  Whether direction was at fault in this production, or simply Rintoul's personal interpretation of the role, this is a very unsatisfying portrayal. <br /> <br />Elizabeth Garvie gives a good effort, but she simply does not have the wit and vivacity of Ehle's Elizabeth.  Again, as with Rintoul, there was much potential here.  In combination with Rintoul's Darcy, this insipid portrayal points to a lack of vision on the production team, more specifically the direction.  I get the feeling that both of these actors had much to give if they had been allowed to give it.  The overall production tries to stick as closely as possible to Austen's Pride and Prejudice, but in the obsession with details, it loses the overall feel and tone of the book.  \\"Couldn't see the forest for the trees\\" has relevancy here. <br /> <br />If you'd like to see a truly good adaptation of the novel, go for the 1995 production, also done by the BBC.  True, it's everyone's favorite, but that's for a reason.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|Anyone who has left a bad review for this CD is simply a little slow to understand music. <br /> <br />I promise, if you have a full appreciation for all music, and don't care about shallow things like an exclamation mark that you think is misplaced, then you will enjoy this band, for Panic! is very, very talented. It's a shame you idiots can't see it.

1932100385|5.0|This is a fantastic book that's loaded with so much eye opening information, it's the kind of book that I'll read again. I feel if you don't convert to a whole food plant based diet after reading this book, I don't think anything in the world will convince you....the evidence is just overwhelming.  <br /> <br /> <br />As for my story, I was on statins for high cholesterol for over 6 years....and a moderate to high dose at that. Over the years, my cholesterol kept rising gradually and my total cholesterol was just over 300 and a triglyceride level in the mid 200's without statins. The moderate/high dose statin brought my cholesterol down to the range of high 190's to low 200's. Over the years, I tried to get off the medication and I was told to try to eat a low fat diet, don't eat shrimp, lobster, etc. I went off the statins, tried this diet for several months and none of this helped....actually my cholesterol went higher....I was told it's hereditary, there's nothing you can do, and I should take the statin and that I would be on them indefinitely. Well, after reading the book \\"The China Study\\", there's a few paragraphs tucked in this great book mentioning that the major factor causing high cholesterol is eating any animal protein. The only meat I ate at the time was fish and chicken and small portions of it....and maybe beef a few times a year, if that. I have to say I was skeptical and figured what do I have to lose, so I went on a whole food plant based diet (vegan diet)as Dr. Campbell in the book suggests. I started that last November (same time I stopped taking the statins), and I had my cholesterol checked this past summer and was stunned at the result....my total cholesterol went from over 300 without statins, high 190's/low 200's on moderate/high does statin, to 175 without statins on Vegan diet, with good LDL and HDL. I'm guessing next time it's checked it will be even lower. Also, my triglycerides went from the mid 200's to 64! All as a result of just giving up animal products....amazing. Now I wonder....why wasn't I ever given this option by the doctor's I've seen over the years? Even if a person doesn't want to give up animal products completely as I have, why isn't this advice offered as at least an option to a patient.....and let the patient decide? What a concept! <br /> <br />Of course, I feel my cholesterol and triglycerides levels are just the tip of the iceberg on how my health has improved on a plant based diet....the only regret?....I wish I started the vegan diet earlier....I never have had so much energy and just downright have never felt so good....seriously...this is not an overstatement. <br /> <br />As to all the doubters out there with harsh reviews, I say to each is own but ignore the evidence at your own risk. I've seen many of my friends and family sick by what I feel this book has proven by many studies to be nothing more than a bad diet for the most part and most of them are looking for a magic pill to save them....and the old standby argument that it's all genetic doesn't appear to hold much water either....again, proven by studies in the book. <br /> <br />My friend, family, and co-workers know how I eat now and wonder why I want to live forever....that's not the issue....quality of life over quantity of life...isn't this what we should all be after?
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Five hundred years into the future, the human race moved to a new solar system with many planets. When the central planets created the Alliance government, a group of Browncoats fought and lost the war for self-rule. Among the renegades are Mal Reynolds and his crew, flying in a Firefly class spaceship called Serenity, searching for petty theft jobs, trying to stay alive. Along the way, they picked up two runaways, a doctor and his psychic but mentally unstable sister. And River Tam carries a secret, which the Alliance's Assassin will stop at nothing to prevent exposure.<br /><br />Whedon brought back the same stellar cast from the cancelled television series Firefly. The movie has western motifs (Browncoats, frontier settings, a draw duel), and plenty of fantastic frames starting from the logo flashing to the future, to the classroom, to the lab, to the Assassin. When we see River's elegant dancer feet, we know danger is coming.<br /><br />The script is quirky, rhythmic (with Chinese curses), and the dialogs superbly blend humor with terror. And Whedon makes his point. The Assassin is a believer. He covets utopia, which the Alliance promises, to justify the violence and destruction he creates. He comforts his victims with `this is a good death' and `there is no shame'. He is composed, pleasant, and honorable. `What I do is evil. I have no illusions. But it must be done.' When he confronts Mal, he asks `Do you know what is your sin, Mal?' To which the stubborn and grumpy rebel who finally found a cause, replies `Hell, I'm a fan of all seven.'<br /><br />Joss Whedon created a sci-fi masterpiece that reminds us the road to hell is paved with good intentions. We have the right to be wrong. Now, can we get Firefly back?
0440237688|1.0|\\"The Giver\\" is as troubling as Jackson's short story, \\"The Lottery.\\" I do not recommend this book for minors of any age: In one scene, the protagonist, as well as other 12-year olds, bathe adults in order to springboard the main character's budding awareness of sexuality and to introduce how the community controls its birth rate. This topic is absolutely inappropriate. Secondly, the author is very proud of her nonconclusive ending. It leaves a bad taste in the mouth and leaves the reader unsatisfied for the time and effort expended to read the book.
B00005JOIF|3.0|In 1972, the world was shocked at an act of terrorism played out on the world stage of the Munich Olympics, when a group of Arab terrorists, known as Black September, kidnapped the Israeli Olympic team from their rooms in the Olympic village, and ultimately killed them all.<br /><br />Faced with this act, and after their defeat of their enemies in the 1967-1969 struggle for their homeland against Arab foes, the country of Israel decides to seek retribution against the 11 men who were involved in the planning of the killings. They struggle with the decision, and the principal of seeking vengeance, but decide they must. They choose, as their instrument, a young Sabra, born in Israel to a hero of Israeli independence. Avram (played by Eric Bana), the young Israeli, was once a bodyguard to Prime Minister Golda Meir. He is impeccably well trained and trustworthy. He absorbs with aplomb the news that he is to be an assassin, to lead an assassination team for the Mossad, and that he will be disavowed by his government if he is caught. His team, four men, is provided to him, along with copious amounts of money to complete his task. His handler, Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush in another brilliant performance) is imperious and demanding.<br /><br />The story is absorbing, the nature of the events shocking, the performances supporting Bana's are very well done. Bana himself is a revelation, and this film should make him a household word.  He is marvelous in his role.  Spielberg ultimately elects NOT to present the film as a justification for what Israel did, but a message about the consequences of seeking an eye for an eye.  He plants seeds of doubt throughout the film, and it is obvious that he has either struggled with his belief that what was done was necessary, OR, he may support what was done, but just want to be more politically correct in delivering his message...that violence to cure violence never works.<br /><br />I think Spielberg has produced a fine film, and perhaps one worthy of four stars and a whole lot of heated conversation about the outcomes.  The violence is shocking, the message is somewhat unclear...the film runs long, but it is ultimately a thriller of the highest standing, with an ending that leaves the filmgoer unsatisfied.<br /><br />But I'm giving the film three stars, and that is reflective of the overall effort, less the absolutely appalling scene where the final film of what happened to the Israeli Olympics team is interspersed with Avram's reunion with his wife in their bed.  I found the juxtaposition of these film slices to be the most shameless and ridiculous film stunt I've seen in a long, long time.  Spielberg should be ashamed of this contrivance.  And this single episode far and away detracts from what should have been an important film.<br /><br />While dodging the bullets of his detractors who will cry false at the \\"violence never works\\" precept, Spielberg did the unthinkable; allowed himself to edit and present in a way that absolutely cheapened the overall effort.  Disappointing.nd perhaps one worthy of four stars and a whole lot of heated conversation about the outcomes.

B00008CMR6|4.0|This is the third remake of essentially the same story by director Hawks and star Wayne. The first two, Rio Bravo and El Dorado are superior with castmates like Dean Martin, Angie Dickenson, and Robert Mitchum though this affable outing is pleasant enough with suppport from the great Jack Elam and the gorgeous Jennifer O'Neal. Wayne, in the sunset of his career, turns in a workmanlike performance with deprecating humor. It's good fun and pleasant to spend time with. No Oscar asperations here.
B00081U7HC|3.0|The stars perform well, and the movie will occasionally make you laugh. Julie Roberts is the type of \\"working girl\\" all men wish they could win over...<br /><br />But a contemporary \\"fairy tale?\\" Let's not be too sentimental. A vain and arrogant rich man hires a woman who \\"puts out\\" for money...  charming.<br /><br />It does become charming, when the vain rich man becomes a more caring person, and the street walker decides she wants a different life...  but one can't help but think this film doesn't glamorize prostitution...

B00006BIO0|5.0|An earier reviewer was whining about JSP records not paying royalties.  Who does this chump think the royalties would be paid to ???  Charley Patton is long dead so quit your carping about the copyright owners not getting their fair share.  These SOB's are making money anyway.  Besides its about the music.
B000AADYRQ|3.0|I am confused that so many people gave this album five stars and called it an extension of \\"Transatlanticism\\". I didn't think \\"Transatlanticism\\" was that great. (Good, yes). I knew after that album came out that Death Cab was changing. Also, I don't think it's fair to compare them to The Postal Service. <br /> <br />\\"Plans\\" upset me off because it feels like a cop out. Like they just threw the songs together. Death Cab is one of my favorite bands of all time. When I compare their last two albums to \\"Something About Airplanes\\" or even \\"The Photo Album\\" (though these two albums were only released two yaers apart, their sounds are completely different), I can't believe it's the same band. <br /> <br />Ben's lyrics used to be so insightful: Sadly sweet mixed with an uncommon sort of hope over catchy melodies. There used to be something cathartic and specific about his words. (Refer to \\"Styrofoam Plates\\" off the aforementioned \\"The Photo Album\\": A song about his deadbeat alcohlic father who died and his internal struggle with it. Or \\"Company Calls Epilogue\\" [\\"We Have the Facts and We're Voting Yes\\"], about the love of his life getting married to someone else.) Now they seem somewhat detached and vague. <br /> <br />\\"Crooked Teeth\\" is my favorite (mainly because it's somewhat dancey). \\"I Will Follow You Into The Dark\\" is also good. <br /> <br />Suffice it to say that Death Cab For Cutie's sound and style is always changing (I wouldn't use the word \\"evolving\\"). Buy this album if you like the singles off of it. Though, I wouldn't recommend it for those who yell out requests for \\"Photobooth\\" at their live shows.
B00000DHR0|5.0|This version of Oh Holy Night will go down in history as the best and most intense and beautiful version of this song ever done. Its arrangement is incredible. The orchestra's strings together with her voice's heart-felt inflections of the songs climaxes, at the spots where the words mean the most, will bring you to cry. Destined to be the song that all others are judged by, this CD is definatly worth the price for this song alone. If I could rate the song I'd give it 10 stars. Perfection.
B000BGH22W|2.0|This score is lack luster compared to the previous by John Williams. I didn't know Williams was not the composer for this film until I went to see. The music from this soundtrack is uninspiring and unmoving. Compared to Azkaban this is just background noise.
B000002J6F|4.0|Alright: it's always a problem to approach an album that's being pushed as \\"classic\\" or \\"best\\". At best, we are robbed of the pleasure of discovery; at worst, we find ourselves wondering why we don't \\"get it\\". Such is the baggage of critical acclaim.<br /><br />Stephen Stills made a lot of albums, and any person experiencing them now for the first time is at a serious disadvantage. All those who crow about events 30 years past simply can't convey them to the younger generations; past experience is necessarily subjective. There is simply no way to communicate the experience of being a young adult in the early 70s if you did not live through it, and any young music-lover today can only infer that there must have been SOMETHING going on by the fact that 1975 marked a strong change from what had gone before.<br /><br />So where does this leave MANASSAS? As observed by another reviewer below, MANASSAS is not strong on radio-friendly singles. It does not mark a stylistic change, let alone set any new trends. It did not outsell Stephen's other albums. In fact, it has only recently gained any particular notice. What's up?<br /><br />The early 70s saw the rise of something that no longer exists: AOR, or Album Oriented Radio. The Beatles had, following Dylan's example, shown that album songs could have a value of their own without being either singles or throwaway filler. In other words, they showed that you could trust the record-buying audience to appreciate good music that wasn't necessarily hit material. Roots material, especially, could be solid compositions without having hit potential. MANASSAS is an album that understood that. Oh sure -- there is a single (\\"Johnny's Garden\\"), but these songs don't really cry out for airplay. That doesn't matter.<br /><br />What this album has on almost every track is staying power. Here, Stills & company trust the listener to hear the heart in these songs without the production, without speeding things up, without assuming our attentions will wander if not enticed every 3.5 seconds. Think EXILE ON MAIN STREET and you'll see what I mean; the music we like most in the long run isn't necesarily what we like first.<br /><br />Stills had built a considerable career on music that used but muted his Southern, blues and Latin influences; here, he gives them full rein, while twisting them all to his own purpose -- and performed by a band that could really do them all justice. Consequently MANASSAS, more than any other SS album, shows the depth and breadth of Stephen's musical vision. Other albums would allow him personally to do more (his first solo outing; the first CSN album) but this one nails every peg square on the head: rock, commercial pop, electric blues, Cuban bluegrass [?!], real bluegrass, country, gospel [!!], folk, easy listening, Latin, commercial folk-rock ... this, really, is the kind of complete musical statement we want every artist to make.<br /><br />-- Which, with the help of a tremendous array of talented musicians, he does. DOWN THE ROAD is more of the same, with a narrower scope and not divided into categories. After that, Stephen seemed content to just make commercial product without really caring what it was. But MANASSAS was a distinct reaction to 1972, to what people were trying to live through, to what Stephen had (or had not) been and could yet be. Give it a few spins yourself & see if (over time) you don't agree.ur attentions will wander if not enticed every 3.5 seconds.

B000AOEN2C|5.0|When I first heard of Star Trek Enterprise I did what most people did when DS9 came out.....dismissed it.  I actually loved all of the previous series but in reading many reviews of this at first I didn't even give it a chance.  BIG MISTAKE on my part.  Reason I say this is because I ended up buying this DVD set because a few friends of mine who like me, dismissed this series said it was killer and that I had to get it.  So I said....why not?  Anyway I am very happy with this series, the first Episode in Season 1 is outstanding.  The first season is sort of choppy, some GREAT episodes and some OK or boring ones.  Season 2 is pretty good as I enjoyed most of it.  Season 2 also gets better and better as you progress through it.  However season 3 and 4 are both fantastic.  This is a pretty good series and the plotlines in seasons 3 and 4 were killer.....a night and day difference from seasons 1 and 2.  I recommend this to Trek fans!
B00079HZUM|5.0|Wonderful movie!  I had just recieved this movie as a christmas gift.  And having been one of the biggest fans of Claire Danes from the start decided to give it a look.  What I found was an absolutely ASTONISHING and BREATHTAKING ride.  I am a very big fan of the Shakespearean Stage and having learned much of my Elizabethan English from his plays I know many of the ideals and situations that are associated with this film.  Claire Danes was AMAZING in her role as Maria.  Showing BEAUTIFULLY the struggle that women had to endure in society at this point in time.  It was a wonderful Heartwrenching rollercoaster ride of emotions from beginning to end.  AND WHAT AN END!  This is one of the few movies where I have ever cried.  It was during the death scene the emotion was beautifully portrayed by Billy Crudup and Claire Danes as well.  Only Baz Luhrman's Romeo & Juliet has made me cry like this it is a WONDERFUL MOVIE.  And I recommend it to ANY Fan of Shakespeare and ANY Fan of a good drama.
B0006B29Z2|5.0|amazing dvd, great live performances when the band was poor!! haha, is really cool to see how they started to become the beasts they are now, anyway I cant wait for the second part to come out!!! they say live after dead would be there, so is going to kick ass too, so hurry up Steve Harris!! and released that dvd!!
B000AP04NI|3.0|I recently saw the (supposedly) last surviving Todd-AO print at a theatre in Minneapolis, and the vibrancy and clarity were striking. <br />I was expecting the same from this DVD, but was shocked at the poor quality transfer.  Not only does it look out of focus, but the color fluctuates as well.  At one point the blue sky turns white! <br />The Cinemascope disc is markedly clearer, but still not as good as it should be, IMHO. <br />I still love the movie, but this set is a disappointment.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Sergio Leone changed the fabric of Western movies with \\"A Fistful of Dollars\\", \\"For a Few Dollars More\\", and \\"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\\". He introduced us to something different and more powerful, he changed the pace and timing of the Western. He added    grit and dirt with less distinction between good and evil. His masterpiece, \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" is the complete Western saga. It is, for me and many others, the best Western, and one of the best films ever made. It is truly a work of art and beauty. The casting, the characters, the music, the story, the sets, the camera work....it is all brilliantly done. It is every Western and yet it stands alone. This film is almost 40 years old, but it could have been made yesterday.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Yeah I love listening to Fall Out Boy and Good Charollete when I really need to rock hard. Fall Out Boy are a bunch of pussies from my hometown who sucked when they played at my high school last year and they continue to suck now.  I can maybe on my most generous day see why you teenie girls listen to that crap, but for you to go around saying that Dave Lombardo (drummer of Slayer) has no talent is not only asinine, it may very well be the dumbest thing I've ever heard.   Your heroes spend about 5 minutes coming up with their songs, and if it takes them longer then they are alot worse than i originally thought.  You are the \\"American Idiot\\" who buys that garbage and keeps bands like Megadeth and Slayer off the radio.
0440238609|5.0|This is by far one of the most brilliant fantasy trilogies I've ever read. Philip Pullman is a genius fantasist and a world-class mythologist. He turns the Catholic Church inside out so that we see its dark, nasty soul in a completely inspiring way. Finally, someone with the balls to creatively criticize one of the world's greatest evils! <br /> <br />His characters are by far, however, his greatest strength. Lyra is strong, moral and adventurous, an incredible spirit who doesn't need religion to shape the goodness in her heart. She's one of the strongest female characters I've found in some many years. I adored her instantly. <br /> <br />If you want a challenge to Narnia, are sick of the Christian allegory that infects that series, yet want an alternative for your child that promotes intelligence, courage and strong values, this is a must read. Even for adults, this trilogy is vastly entertaining and beautifully written. Something that everyone can enjoy on all levels!
B000BKJ78U|1.0|NOT the originals or the CLASSIC set as it is being advertised. Avoid this scam! If you want the originals, get the laser disc from ebay, and get a cheap used player from there as well and you are all set. Perfectly legal to do and then you can enjoy the REAL originals before Lucus had to put his grubby hands on them and change the orginal movies he won awards for.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I finally saw this movie for the first time last night. I knew I would like it since I loved Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical. (although I've not been to see it in the theatre) The music is very moving as before and liked the backstory, as it reminded me of Susan Kay's \\"Phantom\\". (Another must read for any Phantom fan!)
B000000XB9|3.0|With all the recent chatter about Fogarty's successful return, you'd think they'd publish a better mix.  The music's great as is Fogarty...when you can hear him.  I've returned it as being not worth downloading or playing.  The music in this album is all over the place.  Better mixes exist.
B000BMSTMS|1.0|What the hell has happened to Korn becasue they suck ass!
B0009I7NNA|5.0|What an absolutely amazing cd.  There is not a single bad song on here.  The lyrics are thought provoking, the melodies are phenomenal, and the guitar playing is sensational.  A definite throwback to Maiden and Priest, with a modern twist on it.  Anyone who enjoys metal should purchase this album at any cost.  It has given me hope that there are still bands out there making good music.
B000BO0LKY|5.0|I have already reviewed the original release of \\"The emancipation of mimi\\" so i will post that review, along with a review of the extra songs. <br />Mariah has done it again with The emancipation of mimi (Ultra platinum edition\\" She has generously given fans new songs, all of which are single material! <br /> <br /> <br />It's Like That-A fast, up-tempo club song, good vocals on Mariah's part, and the end with fatman scoop is definetly the highlight of the song! The beat is perfect for dancing, definetly one of her best up-tempos! this was the 1st single from the album. Grade:A+  <br /> <br />We belong Together-EVERYONE has heard this one! Beginning with a piano intro, We belong together is one of THE most succsessful singles of the year! The beat is very mid-tempo R&B, and its relaxing. Mariah's voice is suberb, especially her belting at the end! The song is about breaking up with your lover, and wanting them back. This was the 2nd single. Grade:A+  <br /> <br />Shake it off-A mid-tempo R&B song, \\"Shake it off\\" is another breakup song, the song has a beat very similar to ushers \\"confessions part II\\" she even sings in a vein similar to usher! Vocal wise, the song is whispery until the end, but she belts it out in the end. I like the bridge, \\"I gotta shake shake shake it off\\" This was the third single. GRADE A+  <br /> <br />Mine Again- A slow, R&B ballad. It begins with a slow 70's style keyboard, with mariah coming in soon after. During the chorus, she BELTS it out. And the song as a whole has a very 70's feel. I love the flutes in the background, so catchy. The song does lack a good ending though, it kinda just ends all too suddenly. Grade:B  <br /> <br />Say somethin'-A fast, neptunes produced club song. Mariah sounds almost drunk during the berses, and the lyrics are crazy, (references to stars and planets, etc) but the chorus is simply infectious, and the snoop dogg rap fits in with the song perfectly. DEFINTETLY single material. Grade:A  <br /> <br />Stay Thenight- This kanye west produced anthem samples an old song named \\"betcha by golly wow\\" And it has a very old school, Jackson five-ish feel. Mariah wonders whether to sleep with someone she had recently broken up with after he asks her to. The song has a LOT of belting and i like the end where she belts out \\"STAAAY\\" and background vocals start. Pure perfection! Grade:A  <br /> <br />Get your number- A Jermaine Dupri production, the song samples \\"Just my imagination\\" by a group called illusion. The song has a differen't song structure, Jermaine dupri sings the chorus, and Mariah does the the verses, the beat almost makes one think of Mariah's earlier song \\"Fantasy\\" The highlight of the song happens to be Mimi's two 10 second raps, in which she tells of her \\"pimp penthouse\\" and her \\"House in capri\\" This was the 4th single in europe. Grade: A+  <br /> <br />One and only- A very downbeat, slick, R&B song, \\"One and only\\" features a rap by world famous rapper Twista, and is about a cheating man, and how mimi hopes to find her \\"one and only\\" Mariah actually sings VERY fast, like twista, the chorus is a little boring however, could have been better! Grade:B-  <br /> <br />Circles- A slow old school mariah song, its about how she is going around in circles over her man. the production is slow, but good. I love the mariah high note at the end! pure fabulousness! The whole song is a excellent, and the ending is great, good climax! Grade:A  <br /> <br />Your Girl-The song begins with a spanish guitar, and it has a very up-beat feel. Its short, and she really belts out the chorus! It is about wanting to be with someone. What else can i say, a true album highlight!  <br /> <br />I wish you knew-This song has a fake \\"live\\" audience in it, but it fits in the song. The chorus is nice and easy to sing, and I love the spoken word part in the middle, very nice. The osng has a lot of nice background vocals in he beginning and end. Its one of the slower songs, and its a happy song. Grade:A  <br /> <br />To the floor- The fastest song on the second half of the record, this is a duet with nelly, and it was produced by the neptunes. The beat is very fast, and the bass is loud, perfect for the clubs. The vocals by both are whispery, and hard to hear, but it doesnt degrade the song. Grade: A  <br /> <br />Joy ride- Perfect for lounging around, Joy ride's beat is slow, and puts one in a hypnotic state. The vocals are nice and loud, and the verses are sung in an almost nursery rhyme like way. The chorus has more background singers than mariah's voice, but its still a treat. Grade: B+  <br /> <br />Fly like a bird- A gospel song, it is very jazzy, and her pastor makes a cameo! At first, mariah's voice is flat, but as the song goes on, it gets louder and stronger, until the climax, with Mariah belting out the chorus many times, along with a choir chanting behind her. Its probably my favorite song on the record, it is inspiring, fun, and a perfect song in every sense of the word. Grade: A+  <br /> <br />Don't forget about us-A wonderful, beautiful ballad. It is sort of a We belong together part II! Except it has a more R&B beat, and I think better vocals. The chorus is easy to sing along with, and the lyrics are about ending a relationship. I love her vocals at the end! She REALLY belts it out! This is her 17th number one single!!! Grade:A+  <br /> <br />Makin' it last all night (What it do)- A great club song, the rap from JD is grand! It starts with a slow beat, but it builds up. Mariah shows good vocals on the track, and its really nice for gettign ready to go out to the club. Grade: A+  <br /> <br />So lonely (One and only part II)-An up-tempo hip hop song. Twista does the verses, and mariah does the rap and bridge. I personally wish Mariah did more on the song, but her parts are simply infectious. She sings in a whispy voice, and sings about wanting a man and not being lonely anymore. It is a great track! Grade:A+  <br /> <br />We belong together (hip hop remix featuring Jadakiss and styles P.)- A faster version of we belong together, but it is not fast enough to be considered up-tempo. The beat is that of the originals, but sped up, and there is more of a hip hop feel. Mariah chose to re-sing the vocals from the original! I love her rap singing. It is REALLY fast! This may not be as good as the original, but it comes close.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Overall, The emancipation of mimi (platinum edition) is the best record of 2005, and definetly deserving of all the awards it has recently recieved!  <br /> <br />PS: Please do not listen to the negative reviews, they come from jealous madonna fans, who will stop at NOTHING to bring down Mariah, probably because their queens latest album sucks. I am a huge madonna fan, and i am disgusted by their behavior. I hated \\"Confessions on a dance floor\\" but madonna is still one of my faves! The 1 star reviews are only from jealous, hateful people with too much time on their hands. I know they will rate my review as a \\"no\\" but i hope atleast one person finds this review helpful.  <br />
B0000DZEE3|5.0|Best concert DVD I have.  Quality is great, camera work is awesome.  What's even better is the scene they played at.  You get a feel of the energy when you see video of the crowd... simply awesome.

B000B8QEZG|1.0|Madonna's CD is not good. It's all disco music and Madonna can't sing anyway. Every song is rip off of another dance group.Hung up is Abba all the way. Dont' bother with this garbage. <br /> <br />Bo Bice has the best CD ever made, The Real Thing, and it's a SMASH hit, outselling Madonna by a MILE. Try it for yourself and you will see what all the people are buying, Bo Bice!! Buy this you will love it and will become addicted to listening to every song! Amazing debut for theextraordinary AMAZING, Bo Bice!!  <br /> <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|As ever, leave it to MADONNA & she will deliver the best stuff. This album is absolutley AMAZING. The song selection is great, if you wanna have a party just play the CD & it's a great party. <br />I might sound too excited, but being the Material Girl's biggest fan (at least in my opinion) ever since her first single, & being a big DISCO maniac, I can assure you that whatever I say about this album is not enough. <br />You go girl. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000BKVQTS|4.0|I think it takes a very special sort of mind to really appreciate this movie, as with anything original that doesn't apologise for itself. The Brothers Grimm is fresh and inventive, and really quite clever for anyone who's paying enough attention. It both warps history (turning the lawyer Grimms into imaginative charletans) and makes it a focus (setting the story in French-occupied Germany of the 19th century); it alters the familiar fairy tales while adhering to the very dark and sinister quality of the originals.<br /><br />I went into this movie expecting a wild trip, and it more than delivered. The film pulls no punches when it comes to freaking the audience out. At times it verges far nearer the edge of the horror genre than a fantasy or an action-adventure flick, making grown women cringe in their seats (I saw this with three friends, all of us older than 20, and we were all shocked and horror-stricken at various points). The story sweeps you along, though; the violence and gruesome details are not extraneous, but rather underscore the very dark quality of the original tales that the movie is based on. It's this strangeness, though, that may turn off some audiences, particularly those with weak constitutions, or those who come in expecting your typical fairy-tale.<br /><br />Matt Damon and Heath Ledger both put in excellent performances, though the latter outshines the former. Ledger here proves himself a real actor, not just a pretty boy, putting heartfelt sentiment and yearning into Jacob Grimm. Monica Belluci is underused as the seductive and creepy Mirror Queen, and Lena Headey is underapplauded as Angelika. Heady's performance was filled with energy and nerve, and I don't believe she got enough credit for it. Peter Storemare and Jonathan Pryce are also underappreciated in their roles as the outrageous Italian torturer-turned-hero Cavaldi and the almost unbelievably French overlord Delatombe.<br /><br />If you're the sort of person who appreciated the more bizarre elements of Pirates of the Caribbean, or if you read the original Grimm tales and were entranced by the strange and dark delights in them, you'll find this movie extremely entertaining. Few films captivate imagination effectively anymore, and The Brothers Grimm certainly delivers on that front.e more bizarre elements of Pirates of the Caribbean, or if you read the original Grimm tales and were entranced by the strange and dark delights in them, you'll find this movie extremely entertaining.

B000065V41|5.0|Yes I wrote \\"God\\" I will go further by writing Merry Christmas everyone.  Now that my review is fit to be banned in every public school and University I will proceed.    This is the Muppets at their best.  The story is the one we are all familiar with but with the classic touch of Jim Henson.  Michael Caine plays Scrooge, Kermit the Frog is Bob Kratchet, Gonzo narrates, and the rest of the muppets all show up in the various roles.      What can I say.  This is my favorite Christmas movie.  It is fresh and funny every time I watch it.  The songs are good.  The humor is good for adults while remaining appropriate for all ages.  Definitely one for the ages.    Happy Holidays to all of those that do not share my religious beliefs.
6304981635|5.0|Bruce Lee's life was taken over 30 years ago but his spirit still lives on in his films.<br /><br />Enter the Dragon is action-packed with Bruce Lee kickin'! I first watched this movie when I was about 9 &lt;now am 15> and thought it was amazing. The last part prooved the best with all the mirrors. It was a great illusion.<br /><br />Bruce Lee's fighting technique is very unique that you can't distinguish it from reality. You really think he's killing them till they drop dead. Frankly, he's a lot better than Jackie Chan. You could hardly compare their moves. Bruce has this concentration that when he starts fighting, every move he makes is perfect.<br /><br />The plot wasn't very good, to tell you the truth, but it's what's in between the plot that really absorbs the watchers to continue with the movie. The setting was very cool, really ancient-like and very unique.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie a lot. After you watch this, you'll just end up realizing \\"Hey, this dude's already dead\\" because as you watch, you can still feel his spirit moving swiftly on screen.<br /><br />Amazing!<br /><br />Kirstie Mabitad
0066620996|5.0|We had to read this book as a mandatory selection by my university and i usually don't read the books they tell us to read, but thankfully one of my teachers made us read this book, and i am very thankful. The ideas in this book are simple and easy to understand...and while reading it you think, \\"Wow, this is so simple and it makes so much sense, why doesn't everyone know this?\\" <br />This book is also very easy to read, you get through it quickly and without too much effort. I know that most business books are dry and difficult to read (Hello, university textbooks!), but this one is a breeze. <br />Great concepts, comprehendable and smoothly written, I guess my unviersity is finally making some good choices in it's mandatory reading! There is hope for the future!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This movie is, in a word, fantastic. It proves the power of what a fandom can do when the love for a series is strong enough. Serenity keeps all the heart, all the dazzle, all the strength of the Firefly series, while adding the sort of sparkle that a feature film needs. \\"Browncoats\\" and newcomers alike can enjoy this; I came to it in theatres not knowing anything about the series, but I was instantly captivated. One can only hope that interest in Serenity will revive faith in Whedon and demand for the story in some form.<br /><br />The story itself is wildly entertaining. Whedon drops the viewer into a world that is ours. For all it's set five hundred years in the future, it's still just people, it's still all the fancies and foibles of life. He creates a true \\"space western\\" with the sort of energy and liveliness not seen since the original Star Wars trilogy - and he does it with better dialogue, and less focus on flashy special effects. Each character is engaging; every member of the Serenity crew is someone you want to know personally. You want to sign on with Captain Reynolds and throw yourself into danger with him and the rest of the crew. The dialogue is very natural, and unexpected. Whedon makes you think he's going to use typical sci-fi conventions, and then shatters them entirely, undercutting the tension with a quick quip, or having a typically flippant character say something profound without losing his mannerisms. But most of all, the movie makes you feel. You connect, you love... you ache for more when it's over.<br /><br />The special features, incidentally, are also delightful. I'm not someone who usually spends hours watching bonus features on DVDs, but I sat straight through all of these. The deleted scenes are treasures, and Whedon's commentary on them is fascinating, and all of the featurettes showing Whedon and the cast and crew are so heartfelt and so entertaining. Definitely worth watching, just as Whedon's commentary is worth listening to..
B000BYRCH4|3.0|I have to say that this movie was not as bad as some people put it out to be.  Yes, this movie is not Oscar material, but this movie was made for pure entertainment.  This movie will not make you think, this is a movie that you can just sit back relax and kick back with a few beers...the storyline was pretty well developed for a movie of this calibur, and the actors did what they could with the material that they were given.  Excellent underwater footage...just awesome! So, if you are looking for something to just enjoy, without a lot of thought needed, and you can place your expectations down to a lower level, then I would recommend this film.

1400079179|5.0|With over 3,000 Amazon customer reviews already written, there's probably not much more that can be said about this well-read and well-told contemporary tale of historical mystery and intrigue.  Notwithstanding, to those who have panned this delightful yarn - the pointy-headed literary snobs complaining of pedestrian writing style, the elitist scholars hung up on historical minutia, to the fanatic Christians whose faith apparently cannot withstand mild rebuke, I offer two words: lighten up!  America loves a good story, and that Brown satisfies a pent up bottomless demand is evident in the millions of copies sold and month-after-month on everyone's bestseller lists.<br /><br />Brown has emerged from journeyman writer to master storyteller, deserving credit for calling attention to the brilliance Leonardo DaVinci, the art of the Renaissance, the origins of Christianity, and many other important historical events that up till now were cloaked in almost as much obscurity as pre-DaVinci Brown himself.  His adrenaline-charged fiction has us pouring through art books to inspect DaVinci's \\"Last Supper\\" and \\"The Mona Lisa\\", diving deep into our encyclopedias to discover the mysteries of The Holy Grail, Fibonacci numbers and golden ratios, and I'd bet more than a few cracking open their Bible for some fact checking.  While certainly no homage to Christianity, the influences of Paganism in the early church and church symbolism are hardly deniable, and if the references to Mary Magdalene and Jesus Christ cannot be taken too seriously, it is fun conjecture in spite of one's religious beliefs.  While for sure a less than positive portrayal of the Catholic Church, one never feels that Brown's purpose is to preach or proselytize, but merely to entertain.  And therein lies the magic of \\"The DaVinci Code\\": Brown mixes enough historical fact with his purely fictional tale to craft a mystery far more credible, engaging, and educational than standard thriller fare.  From the first mysterious murder in the Louvre to the edge-of-the-seat conclusion, Brown drags us through a couple of centuries while crisscrossing Western Europe with endearing nerd-hero Robert Langdon, the Harvard professor of symbology with the blandness expected of a \\"Jones\\" and none of the flair of \\"Indiana\\".<br /><br />So if you haven't read it yet, what are you waiting for?  The movie?  Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy - the written simply word does not get more enjoyable than this.ysterious murder in the Louvre to the edge-of-the-seat conclusion, Brown drags us through a couple of centuries while crisscrossing Western Europe with endearing nerd-hero Robert Langdon, the Harvard professor of symbology with the blandness expected of a \\"Jones\\" and none of the flair of \\"Indiana\\".  <br /> <br />So if you haven't read it yet, what are you waiting for?

B000B8QEZG|4.0|Like many of the reviewers here, I grew up listening to Madonna. I stayed with her through some awkward phases (think \\"Human Nature\\"), so-so albums (think \\"American Life\\"), and mediocre choices (think \\"The Gap\\" commercial). Not to fear: her new album, while not up to the standards of her classic albums, rocks. <br /> <br />The real stand-outs for me are \\"Hung Up\\" (released on the radio), \\"Sorry\\", and \\"Future Lover\\". In particular, I love \\"Sorry\\". The song build up from a soft beat and then just turns it out. \\"Future Lover\\" has a real Berlin's \\"Metro\\" meets Madonna's \\"Justify My Love\\" that I find really sexy and fun. <br /> <br />The album's a little uneven -- she again re-re-re-discovers her Kabalah faith, which I find a little, well, disingenuous and/or exploitative.  <br /> <br />Even so, it's an album you can download to your iPod and work-out to. It picks me up on a down day and keeps me up! <br /> <br />There's no doubt that Madonna understands the dance floor, and I, for one, am glad she's back on it.

0380973634|5.0|*** possible spoilers ***    What a wonderful book! I am simply awestricken. There are many familiar moments:    -- Earl's Court => Dr. Who's TARDIS    -- The \\"Dance\\" in the Labyrinth => The chase under NYC in Relic    -- Black Smoke in The Gap => the \\"monsters\\" in LOST    -- The rats => Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy    -- The Floating Market => the Gypsy market in His Dark Materials, Diagon Alley in Harry Potter, or even the mysterious bazaars on remote planets in Serenity/Firefly.    -- The coexistence of multiple worlds => HDM    -- The stark Underside and its bizarre inhabitants => Sin City, Interview with the Vampire    -- The adventure and transformation of an unlikely hero (Richard - from the timid office drone to the scared companion to the reluctant fighter to the determined \\"warrior\\"), the shady turning out to be trustworthy (marquis de Carabas), the most angelic is the most evil (Islington), the sinister comic reliefs (Mr. Croup & Mr. Vandemar are as funny as they are creepy), the mysterious and tragic (Hunter)...    However, it is not to say that the book is trite. On the contrary, it is anything but. It does incorporate many of the most successful elements of a fantastical adventure story. The twists and turns will satisfy the critical. Furthermore, Gaiman has an uncanny way of writing that grabs you from the get-go, and draws you deeper and deeper as the story unfolds, stirs your imagination, makes you care about the characters, and renders you breathless and wanting more as the story comes to an end. His language is grim, dark, fluid, poetic, and exquisite. As you turn the pages, letters and words swirl and merge into a kaleidoscope of lush imagery. It's as if you were watching a movie - you can see the engulfing fog, hear the dripping of water, and tremble and shiver in the cold.    When I closed the book, sighing in satisfaction at the ending, I wondered: if it were to be made into a movie, who should be in it? I will pick Tim Burton or Peter Jackson to be the director, and undoubtedly, Gina Torres as Hunter, Natascha McElhone as Lamia, and Johnny Depp as marquis de Cabaras. The sheer malice of Angel Islington is easy to portray and thus can be played by a number of people. However, I haven't figured out who will be good as Door or Richard. Scarlett Johansson might be a good candidate for Door if she gets her hair dyed into \\"red... like burnished copper.\\" Then I realized that Richard is actually the weakest character in the story. Yes, he *is* the protagonist but strangely he really doesn't have anything out of the ordinary (maybe that is exactly the point) and it's very hard to find a perfect match at the snap of a finger.    I have always thought London is an incredibly romantic city, more so than Paris, undoubtedly brought by books and movies like Notting Hill, Love Actually, About a Boy, and Bridget Jones's Diary. Even the names of the subway stations sound oddly endearing. Now I yearn to go there and take their train, and when I see a lone saxophonist at a street corner, I will wonder if it is Lear.
B000002KZ6|5.0|As time passes the accomplishments of Talking Heads are all the more remarkable. Their evolution as a band and their fearless willingness to constantly try new directions in music keep them firmly at the forefront among the most innovative artists in modern music history. Never dated, they continue to stand the test of time. \\"Speaking in Tongues\\" finds them at their creative apex, and perhaps at their most joyful. The expanded lineup first experimented with on \\"Remain in Light\\", is fully integrated into the sound, and the sound is a cool groove of funky polyrhythm mixed with jumpy urban confidence. \\"Burning Down The House\\" opens \\"Speaking in Tongues\\", and immediately announces the album's intent: it's going to burn down your house and you're going to enjoy it. The song was Talking Heads first big hit, and to the surprise and delight of David Byrne was on the playlists of both black and white radio stations. With good reason; it's a full-throated funk stomp, and is as authentic as a P-Funk meltdown. The unique menacing/ebullient attitude of \\"Speaking in Tongues\\" is continued on \\"Making Flippy Floppy\\" and \\"Girlfriend is Better\\", which starts out with the memorable (and post-80's prophetic) line \\"Who took the money/Who took the money away.\\" \\"Slippery People\\" and \\"I Get Wild/Wild Gravity\\" maintain the uptempo paranoia. \\"Swamp\\" (incongruously part of the \\"Risky Business\\" soundtrack), gets gleefully dirty. Its lyrics and their delivery a non-stop montage of cheerful dread, as Byrne intones such ominous pleasantries as \\"Rattle of bones/Dreams that stick out/A medical chart on the wall/Soft violins/Hands touch your throat/Everone wants to explode.\\" sounding like a redneck sherrif/nuclear physicist. Fun. \\"Moon Rocks\\" and \\"Pull Up The Roots\\", jump back on the apocalyptic dance party train, which, by and large is what \\"Speaking in Tongues\\" most closely resembles. Lyrically and musically creating an aural journey of post-modern dread combined with an underlying and inexplicableoptimism. It is, in retrospect, a perfect and prophetic distillation of the 1980's, in sound and texture, as well as lyrically. The jouney's ultimate destination is home. \\"This Must Be The Place (Naive Melody)\\" is a wondrous hymn to the primal joy of home and unconditional love. It's \\"naive melody\\" the result of the band playing instruments they were inexperienced with. It contains the sweetest and most un-self consciously yearning music and lyrics Talking Heads ever created: \\"You've got a face with a view/I'm just an animal looking for a home.\\" \\"And you'll love me till my heart stops/Love me till I'm dead.\\" \\"Sing into my mouth.\\" It's achingly poignant yet strangely reassuring, and a transcendant moment for the band. \\"Speaking in Tongues\\" starts by burning down your house and ends with the gift of the true home in your heart. It's profound and funny at the same time and all in all, an enduring testimony to a band like other, at the peak of their powers.
B000ASDFJU|4.0|Is it irratiting? Sometimes, yes. Did the series run its course? Yes. Did the last season have a little too much of a Scooby-Doo ending (you know, where every loose end is tied up in the nick of time)? Yes. <br /> <br />Despite all its flaws, you know you loved the series. This box set is a great gift for the afficianado of the series. It could have more extras. Still, though, it's a pretty good value for all these episodes, and the series in re-runs just isn't the same because of its censorship. Heck, Samantha is practically edited out in her entirety in syndication! <br /> <br />Overall, a good value for a guilty pleasure. Even when it was bad, it was still pretty good.
B000BTJDGC|4.0|If you go into the film \\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\\" thinking it is a horror movie, you're going to be disappointed. This misleading concept can be blamed on two things: 1) The advertising that was used during the release of this film and 2) The fact that the word \\"Exorcism\\" will forever be linked to \\"The Exorcist\\" which was a horror film.  Maybe the \\"based on a true story\\" plays a factor as well since this phrase is often twisted out of context and used to describe horror movies (The Amityville Horror, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, etc).  This movie has horrific images but it is far from a horror film, at least in the traditional sense.<br /><br />The story is told in a parallel nature; Emily's story unfolds in a series of flashbacks during the course of the trial for the priest that performed an unsuccessful exorcism, that many believe led to her death.  This is a difficult feat to accomplish, to keep the viewer moving from past to present seamlessly and without being jerked back and forth.  Director Scott Derrickson excels at this task and creates an atmosphere of suspense and dread from start to finish.<br /><br />I am rarely a fan of \\"courtroom dramas\\" typically finding myself looking at my watch because the film tends to drag on for me.  This was certainly not the case for this film because the interwoven storyline grabs your interest and keeps things moving right along.  The cast is superb.  Laura Linney plays the doubtful \\"I'm here to win to get a promotion\\" defense attorney that shifts her belief system gradually and almost unnoticed throughout the film.  She continues to deny the things she has heard and seen right up to the end, because she has always done so.  Linney's  understated performance is top-notch and right on the money.  Tom Wilkinson, the accused priest, also turns in a top-rated performance.  His desperation is based not on the desire to be found not guilty, but his need to tell the true story of Emily Rose.  His quiet, defeated manner reflects the way this character would have been affected by this experience and any other means of conveying this would have made the character seem over-the-top and unconvincing.  The rest of the cast, from the prosecuting attorney that is depicted not as the enemy but almost as a defender of faith, the afflicted Emily Rose whose torment drives the film, her family members who seem truly confounded by this experience and the defense attorney's boss, who pushes her to obtain a deal to get rid of this case, all put in believable performances.  The end result is a solid, unsettling and suspenseful film..

B000AADYYO|4.0|A journalist from UKs \\"Classic Rock\\" magazine wrote a review of  a London gig Opeth played at, and all he could say was \\"WOW!\\" I can completely understand, and I am one who would love to see them Live to get the full compliment. The musicianship and writing is fantastic to say the least. I, like quite a few others, came across Opeth through the Steve Wilson/Porcupine Tree link, and I have no time at all for Death Metal. This CD would have got 5 Stars from me but for the overuse of the Death Grunts. Maybe they are required (I dont know) but the guy has got an amazing voice, and in songs like \\"Atonement\\" I am gobsmacked!!! Words fail me. Beyond the Mire is another highlight (Especially the Kashmir like introduction) and the song even has the death growls in it. <br />On the softer songs (especially on the previous mellower Opeth CD produced by Steve Wilson) I was immediately brought to mind of early 70s Obscure English Prog Rockers \\"Fantasy\\". Opeth would be my number one band, as I said if the vocals were free of Death grunts, but I am sure many diehard and original Opeth fans would be horrified by that. You cant win all the time, can you?
B000BTJDGC|1.0|my husband and i rented the unrated version recently and i'm sorry to say that we were very disappointed. Not only was it boring, but they never showed what happened to her the night she died, they completely skipped over it. Not sure why it was unrated either, nothing in the movie was gory, no cursing, still can't figure it out. Yes it was a little creepy in certain parts; few and far between, but nothing that would make it \\"unrated\\". I think that the people that put the movie out on video thought that by calling it unrated that more people would be curious, like my self and my husband were. to be honest we laughed at a lot of the scenes when \\"Emily\\" was possessed. (some of the dumbest acting yet) and the shreiking and screaming, i wanted to mute it. I've seen better courtroom dramas on the lifetime television station. Don't bother with this stinker. <br />
B00007LTIL|5.0|In 1970 the Grateful Dead shocked fans and record company execs. by expanding their pyschedelic experiemenation into the realm of laid back country songs and harmony singing.  Mickey Hart once remarked that their pair '70 albums, \\"Working Man's Dead\\" and \\"American Beauty,\\" were like the band returning to earth after spending a few years in space.  The sound of these albums was definately much more grounded and earthy. <br />\\"American Beauty,\\" was the second of the two albums and was the most personal.  The band had endured the deaths of Phil Lesh's father and Jerry Garcia's mother and the sadness is reflected throughout the album.  Robert Hunters lyrics are exceptional with images of light, dark, pain, happiness, and life.  Its a truly beautiful album. <br />\\"Box of Rain,\\" is the song that Phil and Hunter wrote for his father.  The imagery of the song is quite beautiful and open to interpretation.  Phil's singing on the track is joyful and heartfelt. <br />\\"Friend of the Devil,\\" is a fun Garcia-Hunter tune about being an outlaw outrunning the devil.  David Grisman's mandolin gives the song a bluegrass feel. <br />\\"Sugar Magnolia,\\" is one Bob Weir's most enduring tunes.  Its a joyful summer time song about a girl, of course.  This song serves well as describing a Dead Head's dream girl.  Every male Dead Head wants a girl to call his Sugar Magnolia, a girl that can be his summer lovin' in the spring, fall and winter. <br />\\"Operator,\\" is the lone Pigpen tune on the album.  Its a short but sweet country-blues. <br />\\"Candyman\\" is a pretty haunting tune that sends chills when you hear Garcia's jovial singing voice sound dark and harrowing when he sings \\"if I had me a shot gun I'd blow you straight to hell.\\" <br />\\"Ripple\\" is my pick on the album.  Jerry's singing is a return to his strained heartfelt vocals.  The song is just one of those great life as a journey tunes.  It tells how we must travel a road through life that is unique, beautiful and all our own.  It isn'ta song of isolation, however.  We still need people.  You can't help but get a warm feeling, when Jerry sings \\"if I knew the way, I would take you home....\\" <br />\\"Ripple\\" segues perfectly into the sad country tune \\"Brokedown Palace.\\"  Its a great song about a traveller returning home from a road of hardships.  Its another great life song. <br />\\"Till the Morning Comes,\\" is a catchy little tune, but probably the weakest on the album, at least to me. <br />\\"Attics of My Life,\\" is a fantastic vocal performance from the Dead as harmony singers.  It is their arguably their best attempt at CSN&Y style singing.  The song is a beautiful reflection on life, death, and aging. <br />Closing out the album is the Dead's signature tune, \\"Truckin'.\\"  It is an autobiographical tune about life on the road and drug busts.  It also contains one of the most famous lines that Hunter ever wrote that has become the slogan for the Dead, \\"what a long strange trip its been.......\\" <br />

Those who put down this album either lack an ear for good music or a sense of humor for the lyrics.
B00008PX8P|5.0|As a teen growing up in the early 1970's, Led Zeppelin reined supreme among my circle of friends. Rock classics such as: \\"Communication Breakdown,\\" \\"Whole Lotta Love,\\" \\"Heartbreaker,\\" \\"Immigrant Song,\\" \\"Black Dog,\\" and the timeless, \\"Stairway to Heaven,\\" became anthems of a generation. In darkened theaters, we watched in awe, the concert movie \\"The Song Remains the Same,\\" and wore the grooves off inaudible bootleg albums with such titles as: \\"Live at Blueberry Hill,\\" \\"V1/2,\\" and \\"Bonzo's Birthday Party.\\" We stood in line all night in the pouring rain thankful to get $8.50 tickets for their February 8, 1975 show at the Philadelphia Spectrum highlighting their \\"Physical Graffiti\\" tour. Having seen them live, our Zeppelin journey was then complete.<br /><br />Jimmie Page, Robert Plant, John Paul Jones, and John Bonham are/were four incredibly gifted and talented musicians. Inaccurately labeled with the moniker \\"heavy medal,\\" their musical styles and influences ranged from blues and rockabilly, to mid-east and Indian rhythms and chants. Their compositions ran the gamut from lost love, to the darkest reaches of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-Earth; their lyrics told of life in the Dark Ages, to the farthest reaches of Britain's far-flung empire. Yet creative artistry and studio magic is worthless, if the band cannot reproduce their sound live. This DVD proves, without a doubt, that Led Zeppelin was one of the greatest live acts in rock history.<br /><br />This two-disc package highlights four live concerts spanning their career from 1970 to 1979.  Early television show performances, promos, a news conference, and a few added morsels are included, and add archival significance for the hard-core fan.<br /><br />Disc One showcases a 1970 concert at London's Royal Albert Hall. Raw and gutsy sound, with little or no special effects shows Zeppelin in their early blues-rock period of the first two albums. Blues-jazz influenced standards like: \\"I Can't Quit You Babe,\\" \\"Dazed and Confused,\\" and \\"What is and What Should never Be,\\" are offset by harder rock versions of \\"We're Gonna Grove,\\" Whole Lotta Love,\\" and \\"Communication Breakdown.\\" Page sits and dons a vintage Dan Electro guitar for a rare guitar solo labeled \\"White Summer,\\" while a thinner, youthful John Bonham attacks the skins in \\"Moby Dick.\\" Well versed fans will appreciate the rarity of two loosely improvised versions of Eddie Cochran classics \\"C'mon Everybody,\\" and \\"Something Else,\\" and Plant blowing harp and singing a seldom performed \\"Bring it on Home.\\"<br /><br />Disc Two opens with a true bootleg recording of \\"Immigrant Song\\" dubbed over a fan's home movie footage of a 1972 outdoor venue in Australia. Totally out of synch, only the hardcore fan will appreciate this four-minute insert. Next comes four tunes left out of the 1976 film, \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" (\\"Black Dog,\\" Misty Mountain Hop,\\" \\"Since I've Been Loving You,\\" \\"The Ocean\\"). Ironically, similar concert footage that mesmerized me then, proves the weakest performance on the DVD. The band as a whole is lose, Page's playing is sloppy, and Plant seems more concerned with looking like a rock star, than singing like one. The band butchers \\"Since I've Been Loving You,\\" one of the most beautiful blues songs in rock. This is the biggest let-down, as I am sure a better version of this lovely song must exist somewhere.<br /><br />Earl's Court - 1975 highlights the band's acoustic set before \\"up-plugged\\" was in vogue. Debunking their \\"heavy medal\\" rap, Zep proves they're equally at home playing by an open hearth, as raising the roof off a stadium arena. Jones, a musical virtuoso, adds flawless mandolin melodies to studio quality versions of \\"Going to California,\\" and \\"That's the Way.\\" Page, a master on acoustic guitar, strums the intricate and fast-paced \\"Bron Yr Aur Stomp,\\" as Bonham adds a pounding bass drum bottom. Page's slide guitar (same Dan Electro as \\"White Summer\\") dominates the epic \\"In My Time of Dying,\\" a show stopper onthe 1975 tour, and best performance in this segment. Jones's keyboard skills are underscored, yet suffer from low volume in \\"Trampled Under Foot,\\" and the Zeppelin classic \\"Stairway to Heaven.\\"<br /><br />Knebworth - 1979 opens with a sound-check version of \\"Rock and Roll.\\" It is clearly evident that the band has come full circle and matured as artists in this segment. Jones has traded in his hallmark Fender Jazz bass for a custom built 8-string Alembic with intricate mother of pearl inlays. Plant cares less about looking like a rock star, and concentrates more on the singing style that first brought him fame.  Matching Page's phaser-laden intro note for note on \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine,\\" Plant recaptures the raw power of his younger days. \\"Yeah...do you know my name...do I look the same?\\" Plant taunts the audience in \\"Sick Again,\\" as Bonham, a bit heavier, never performed better.<br /><br />Without a doubt, \\"Achilles Last Stand\\" is Zeppelin's best live performance ever! I had my doubts as to how the band would pull this epic off live. The song will leave you breathless! Bonham matching Page's guitar notes with machine gun flurries on the snare has to be heard and seen to be believed. A laser-lit kettle-drum intro to \\"In the Evening,\\" provides a breather, before another stellar performance of the Arabic influenced \\"Kashmir.\\" Although Jones's Mellotron could have been louder, the song is hypnotizing with Bonham's drum work, once again, powerful, yet beautiful in its simplicity. Another jammed out version of \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" ends the set.<br /><br />A year after Knebworth, John Bonham, age 32, would be dead of an alcohol overdose. Jimmie Page would go on to a brief stint with singer Paul Rogers in The Firm. John Paul Jones would record and produce for movie soundtracks, and turn out a couple obscure solo albums. Robert Plant would have a successful solo career that would never equal his years with Zeppelin. In hindsight, this DVD illustrates the essence of Led Zeppelin. In fact, it is the best Zeppelin bootleg ever. Five stars, Bravo!how stopper on the 1975 tour, and best performance in this segment.

B000BJS4SU|5.0|Blues guitar purists may balk at buying this CD since Mr.Mayer has achieved fame by writing well crafted pop tunes sung in a laid back manner. <br />Wipe that image of John Mayer from your mind now!Or at least TRY. <br />The 1st tune up on this disc will have you second guessing yours ears as John sings \\"Who Did You Think I Was\\".You might think it was the ghost of SRV himself singing since Mayer sounds surprisingly like the great blues guitarist/singer who inspired him to play the blues in the first place.John's guitar intro on this tune will quickly silence any doubters who may question Mayer's ability to \\"talk the talk\\" and \\"walk the walk\\". <br />Check out \\"Wait Until Tomorrow\\".There's never been a doubt that drummer Steve Jordan is a BAD MOFO,but his super hip updated Mitch Mitchell groove is so smokin' you'll almost forget to listen to Mayer play and sing this Jimi Hendrix classic! <br />The super slow blues,\\"Out Of My Mind\\",might make some girls wonder where their posterboy of pop has gone to.I'll tell you where he's gone to...he's gone home to his blues roots. <br />The boy burns this blues number to the ground.Steve Jordan and bassist Pino Palladino lay down the sparsest of accompaniment forcing Mayer to dig deep and testify to the blues' healing power pretty much on his own.You'll feel pretty good after he puts the wraps on this 12/8 track.I sure did. <br />I'll leave you to find out how good the rest of this CD is and finish up my brief review by urging all who love good old fashioned guitar god blues-rock to put this one in your shopping cart and proceed to checkout immediately.You don't want to wait for any more reviews to convince you to buy TRY any longer. <br />This is the last review to read.Period. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This movie has everything you want in an action Sci-Fi adventure.   Yes, it's true you don't need to watch the TV show to enjoy the Serenity movie.  But after you watch it I guarantee you'll have the urge to run out and buy the boxed set.   I saw it twice at the theater and just watched for the first time today on DVD.   I think I like this movie better each time I watch it.   It's clear a lot of effort and love went into a project that by all rights never should have happened.    With it's intelligent writing and great cast, just like Firefly deserved a full run, this movie deserves to be a mega-hit.
078681859X|5.0|Granted, I have not read that many fantasy books. Oh well. <br /> <br />The footnotes get tiring at first, but once you get used to it, you can conquer the whole book. <br /> <br />What I especially like about this book is its writing style. Big words or not, Stroud manages to make his sentences flow smoothly from beginning to end. And he does not overdo it with making the adjectives the subject of a sentence, which helps. I also thought some of the references to historical subjects and figures were clever. <br /> <br />There are some of the down points, of course. For one thing, I didn't care much about the characters until later on in the story. Nathaniel was irritatingly a cross of cowardice and arrogance at first, and I didn't find Bartimaeus that appealing of a character until the bond between him and Nathaniel sort of formed. I also find it unfathomable that Bartimaeus would know that the Amulet of Samarkand is important but not specifically in what way. And there are some more holes like that. <br /> <br />But overall, good book.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|Peter Jackson's blockbuster is a feast for the eyes and an emotional trip that will reacquaint you with Hollywood's adored giant gorilla: King Kong. The classic story of King Kong is told through amazing cast performances, mind-blowing visual and sound effects, emotive gorilla and an impeccable production quality.<br /><br />The film is 3 hours and 15 minutes long, but not a moment goes by where you feel it being boring or dragging in any way. The first 45 minutes go into setting up the storyline and its various themes, something Peter Jackson does very well without boring his audience. The rest of the film is an adrenaline-pumping, nail-biting roller-coaster that takes you from the wilderness of an uncharted island to 1930's New York City.<br /><br />Kong himself is a modern marvel to behold. The details put into this computer-generated (CG) giant ape are incredible. From his very expressive face to his detailed, very fine hair, he definitely comes alive to the point that your eyes tear for him. Nothing less was expected from the director that brought us Lord of the Rings!<br /><br />King Kong is a must-see-on-a-big-screen kind of film. Take the whole family or your group of friends and go see it. It's a long film, so make sure you go potty before it starts cause you don't want to miss out on any part of this amazing ride!
B00000AFHM|4.0|Imagine The Smiths if they traded the dark romanticism for a more organic sound, and if they had a miniature orchestra behind them, and you can guess what Belle & Sebastian is all about. They stunned the world in 1997 with \\"If You're Feeling Sinister\\", but be assured: this follow-up is the better album.<br /><br />\\"The Boy With The Arab Strap\\" is one of the best indie albums to come out of Scotland. Infectious pop-rock melodies that can compete with the best 60's bands, huge swelling instrumental crescendos like bursts of morning sunlight through your bedroom window, lyrics that are equally smart-ass punk and detached hipster poet, and even some electronic sections, such as the strange \\"Space Boy Dream\\" track. The music is mainly pretty wispy and docile, but it's got a modernized feel to it, so it's dreamy instead of cheesy. \\"Sleep The Clock Around\\" bobs around whimsically like a child at an amusement park (it's also a great make-out song), \\"Dirty Dream Number Two\\" has an incredible, breathtaking climax, and \\"Simple Things\\" has an awesome dense web of chiming guitars.<br /><br />This is great for peaceful summer days. Sometimes I see people describe Belle & Sebastian as \\"depressing, rainy day music\\", and I wonder if we're listening to the same album, although I can see why some people would think something like that, because of the private, alienated feel of some of the songs. Whatever mood it's for, add it to your collection.
0393327655|1.0|Once again we encounter someone who fears Truth. The author is a typical modernist who likes to come up with excuses about why he has no faith. Being open to everyones beliefs is Ok, as long as they don't discuss it with anyone. This author is among the minority of mankind who has no faith in God. Obviously he fears faith combined with reason. Don't be misguided into thinking that everyone thinks like he does. Ye of little faith, ye of no faith.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|At last, from those far sixties - when the crooners seemed to be something easy to get even in the most discrete tavern - appears this young artist, who must be in his middle twenties whose charismatic presence has surprised pleasantly the entire world with this sinuous but equally expressive voice and nice melodic timber, filling a visible void in this genre.<br /><br />To my mind, Bubble has became the true musical revelation this year. He possesses everything a crooner needs to triumph and win.<br /><br />I just hope through the years, his maturity allows him to keep growing up. The world was orphan and ( why not? let 's say it clearly) even tired of listening so mediocre singers who need avid and desperately the support of the Video Clip and great special effects to promote themselves.<br /><br />This young gentleman, fortunately does not need any of these devices.
0714843377|5.0|I picked it up because the title grabbed me but when I looked inside the pictures did too!  Author Paul Arden has put together a highly illustrated book which integrates the words almost seemlessly with the images.<br /><br />Definitely a book written with an advertising edge for anyone who is working in any field where creativity is needed (and that's in every job in any part of the world).  Because it's small you can pick it up and drive through a few pages without any difficulty.  Text is large enough to be read by anyone making it very easy on the eyes.<br /><br />What is really moving is that the concepts are easy to grasp making it simple to apply the ideas Paul has shared. You'll appreciate this aspect if you're a busy person with hardly no time to read.  And if you've read any of my other reviews you know how important and mind growing a book has to be for me to read.  So yes, this book has all the right pieces in the construct for you to achieve great mental development and a few laughs along the way.  You'll enjoy it if you like books with an upbeat and insightful nature.<br /><br />Your Servant,  Deremiah, *CPE
0767810856|4.0|May be you don' t believe it, but from time to time, there are certain poetic films that would seem to recover its majesty even in the most unexpected circumstances.<br /><br />The plot is a fairy tale indeed, but in last instance, who cares about it ?. The final intentions are precisely what it counts. A winning lottery ticket will become the sparkling breach to narrate a story that surely will enchant you.<br /><br />A marriage in disgrace due both of them would seem to talk by different TV channels. His marriage is far to be a dialogue, but an exchange of monologues. A honest man, a good guy, a candid man, is a cop in NYC, an ambitious wife; a disillusioned woman plenty of good feelings who suddenly will meet one each other in this little picture of low budget perhaps, but loaded of spring vision. There will be a gradual, very emotive and absolutely expected love affair between these solitaire souls, that will experience certainly new, varied, encountered and cruel emotions.<br /><br />I  have always been engaging with Bridget Fonda as actress. She possesses that delirious touch just reserved to a few artists. She illuminates the screen with her mesmerizing sidereal beauty ornamented with her naïve smile; she is a lovely and very talented artist who stole the show along the picture. Rosie Perez is fine as the ambitious wife and the great Seymour Cassel as the elegant Jack Gross is terrific. Nicholas Cage in one of his best performances ever; very natural and credible in that character The script has no fissures, the frame is the always changing City of the World and the fit camera of Andrew Bergman, will allow to reconcile us with the life through this unusual film, without special effects, free of violence, chase cars and sensationalist explosions. I swear it.<br /><br />A beauty parable of the Good Samaritan, and the expected boomerang reaction of the community respect this very weird behavior.<br /><br />The Angel 's device is imported from \\"The wings of desire\\".

0553801503|2.0|This series started out with immense promise.  A deep, rich setting, a diverse cast of characters and a solid foundation for an epic story.  Not least is the author's willingness to throw curves by either killing off characters who would in lesser series be sacrosanct or redefining characters to break them out of the hero/villain mold.  Martin is obviously a master of his craft. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this latest installment is long on writing and short on storytelling.  There is little if any character progression, and what little there is could easily have fit into a synopsis rather than a tome of this size. <br /> <br />Bring a pen and paper to keep track of the characters and their relationships, as the sheer mass of them is difficult to keep up with, and with characters popping in and out of significance, it's difficult to know who to follow (and after a while, difficult to care) <br /> <br />I understand that editing constraints forced them to release this as two volumes rather than one, but I would think that a bit of discipline on the part of both the author and the editor would have been much more effective than simply splitting the book.  Compare this series to The Lord of the Rings or Tad Williams' masterpiece \\"Memory, Sorrow and Thorn\\".  Both have as vast a story and much deeper character development, yet manage to keep the story moving and keep the reader emotionally invested in the characters.  This series, on the other hand, seems to be becoming the \\"Days of our Lives\\" of fantasy -- lots of subplots, but very little overall progression. <br /> <br />A disappointment to see what could have been a benchmark in the genre get tangled up in itself.  I hope the next few installments don't fall into this trap.
B00005JKCH|4.0|This famous fiction personage follows in its basic conceptual roots, similar traces of its predecessors; Superman and Batman. Once more the myth is born again; our local hero `s origins are diffuse. As its ancestors he is orphan; hence he has not common roots with his community; all of them are shy and intend by all their means have not love affairs that eventually might lead us to marriage; the hero must not leave inheritors, because that would mean the end of his role in this world.<br /><br />But there are specific differences: NYC is NYC, there was not any masked metaphor allusive to it such as Gothic City or Metropolis. He is not an alien as Superman; on the contrary, his super powers proceed from natural causes, through an unexpected genetic crossroad.<br /><br />The film merits lays undeniable, on a very amusing parade of special effects here and there with a touch of suggested sex, when covered by a suspenseful action, his secret love is blockaded by four intruders in the middle of a rainy and lonely street.<br /><br />From the times of The Phantom (1996), the industry had not generated any other carton hero. And the election of Tobey Maguire could not be more fortunate. He possesses all the attributes for the character, an undeniable charisma. Dafoe is fabulous as the sinister villain. Do not scrape too much underneath the script, just forget the quotidian reality and come inside this evasive diversion.<br /><br />Adequate familiar entertainment.
B0009MDPYM|3.0|Constantine is your basic man-vs-devil plot, with lots of biblical and mythological history thrown in.  Until checking the reviews, I didn't realize this was once a comic book, but when watching the DVD, I definitely got the feeling that the directors had a good time as many crazy shape-shifting and skin-morphing special effects that they could pull off.<br /><br />[...]  He delivers everything in his stoner monotone and has no range of emotion.  Everyone in the movie, in fact, showed no emotion.  No one ever got excited or agitated--they maintained the same calm, steady pace no matter whether they were doing something mundane or trying to save the future of mankind.<br /><br />This plot had a lot of potential, but it seems like the focus was on neat-o special effects and not on decent acting.
B00005JO1Y|3.0|I came into this movie with high hopes.  I was a bit disappointed.  It had some good parts.  I liked the dinosaur scenes.  I really liked the character \\"Jack\\".  Jack Black was perfect for the role of \\"Carl\\".  Although many people die, there isn't a lot of blood.  Here are a few things that lowered the rating for me: <br />1. Many of the action scenes were so quick and bumpy that they made me motion sick.  That certainly didn't help me enjoy the movie. <br />2. I never really connected with King Kong.  They had some times where they were trying to develop that relationship, but I never really connected with him.  Therefore, I didn't really care when he died. <br /> <br />The biggest problem in these two was the first.  It's really hard to enjoy a movie that makes you feel sick when you watch it.  Maybe it will be better on the smaller screen.
B000BB1MHS|5.0|Visually stunning (but not to the detriment of the story).  Musically amazing.  Wickedly demented.  Incredible casting.  This is a movie to be enjoyed completely separately from the original big-screen adaptation of Roald Dahl's book.  Dahl is a dark writer who borders on being suitable for children, and this movie is true to his vision.  It's darkly touching, not candy-coated or softened-up in any way.  Watch this movie to see a young boy triumph over adversity and an overgrown child come to find the family he never had,
B000000OXH|4.0|With the success of their first LP, I'm sure this follow up was a little rushed in the making. Steve Howe had left for a while to spend time with his wife and family, leaving Wetton and Downes as the main songwriters.  <br />What a fine team they made, great songs like \\"Don't Cry\\", and my favorite Wetton-only-written \\"The Smile Has Left Your Eyes\\". I originally didn't care much for the others when I first heard the LP, but letting all the songs play one afternoon changed my mind. (This is where I make my recommendation to purchase it in CD format). \\"Midnight Sun\\", \\"Eye to Eye\\" and \\"Open Your Eyes\\" are all good songs. <br />One missing from this disc is \\"Daylight\\" which at the time was only available on the pre-recorded cassette tape, or the b-side of \\"Don't Cry\\" (Although available now on \\"Asia Gold\\" and \\"Anthologia\\"). <br />Who knows where this may have gone had Howe given input to the some of the song writing. As it is, the disc stands up pretty well anyway.  <br />If you've read any of my other Asia reviews, here it goes again, pick up \\"Asia Gold\\" or \\"Anthologia\\" instead. The tracks have been re-mastered and with a little higher price, but also include the b-sides. You get it all: Asia, Alpha, Astra, and Then & Now on two discs and sounding better than ever.  <br />I would recommend this disc to any who need a complete collection, or have the other three Wetton era CD's <br />
B0009VRHLK|3.0|This movie garned lots of press at international film festivals for its \\"racy segments.\\"  Gallo is a one-of-a-kind actor/director, and I was early awaiting his latest offering on DVD, especially if it was sensationalist and scandalous.  If you check this movie out, be prepared for some veeeeeery slow action for 99% of the film.  We get many scenes of driving--driving at night, driving during the day, driving with a bug-splattered windshield, driving through small towns, driving past truckstops, driving in the mountains, and more.  You will definitely \\"get it\\" and feel like you are on an endless, monotonous car trip with no point.  My recommendation for surviving the driving scenes is to make judicious use of the \\"skip ahead\\" button once you've seen the first few minutes of driving.<br /><br />All of the action happens in the last 20 minutes of the movie.  There is a brilliant plot twist that actually comes close to making the film worth it, and there is the infamous *real* oral sex performed by Ms. Chloe Sevigney.  The scene is actually the climax of the movie, because the conversation they have during the interlude highlights everything going on in their relationship.<br /><br />All in all, I'm glad I saw this movie, if only because it was made famous by the insults traded back and forth between Gallo and Robert Ebert.  If you watch it, know that the last 20 minutes is where it is at, so don't give up hope during the early pointless scenes.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|Outstanding concert footage.  The quality of course isnt there but its great to look back on the early days of the band.  I hope there is more never before seen footage coming out from the past that would be spectacular or better yet, for Bruce and the band to find that kind of passion again before its too late or they are too old and put out some new jamming material.
0790731509|5.0|This is classic American cinema not to be missed.  It is one of the first anti-hero movies, a reaction to the cotton-candy goodness of movies during the 1950's and the McCarthy era.  It was made as the studio system was crumbling and more and more directors were being influenced by European cinema.<br /><br />Newman is absolutely at the top of his game as Luke, a war hero turned petty criminal who is sent off to a Southern prison camp.  Full of religious symbolism and themes, this drama shows the strength of man and his relationship to God.  This is the type of movie that gets under your skin and stays there.  As a member of a younger generation, I was also excited to see the original source for many quotes which have become part of American culture.
B0006IIPIK|1.0|This movie was really horrible for me.  I have seen some pretty bad movies that for one reason or another I still watched one more time or two.  Yet, with this film I couldn't even bring myself to put it in my DVD player again.<br /><br />Yes, the type of noire was interesting at first.  Yet, after about 10 minutes I couldn't take anymore.  The acting was horrible, espsecially Gwyneth Paltrow who for me was not convincing as being from the the 1930's-1940's era.  The idea of propelor planes fighting huge robots was problematic.  I was especting this movie to have epic battles between more than one plane and the robot army, but this was not the case.  I also didn't like that fact that the ENTIRE movie was CGI.  There is a scene where they are walking through a jungle that doesn't look real at all.<br /><br />It would be different if the movie had a believable plot, believable characters, and at least a believable vilan.  The film for me had none of these.<br /><br />So unless I was watching the wrong movie I have to say this was one of the most boring movies I have ever seen.  I would give it a negative score if I could.
0553381350|1.0|If you want to know the truth about the time and people portrayed in this book try reading Lost Astronaut or one of dozens of other books written by the astronauts and the people closest to them at the time. There are many many excellent books. I have had the pleasure to read most of them. THIS IS A MOVIE at best and a LIE at worst. I hope Tom made lots of money.
B000002GB2|5.0|Equinox was the very first Styx album for A&M. They already released four albums on the Wooden Nickel album and by the time they signed for A&M they started getting some chart success with \\"Lady\\" which appeared on Styx II (1973), but didn't start charting until after Man of Miracles was released near the end of 1974. Although their Wooden Nickel albums are worth owning, those albums demonstrated that they weren't certain whether they wanted to be a straight-ahead hard rock band or a prog rock band. Styx newcomers are obviously avised to go with their major label efforts (particularly Equinox, Crystal Ball, The Grand Illusion, and Pieces of Eight) first before diving deeper in to the Wooden Nickel catalog. With a new label, and new album, Equinox, the band was able to merge the hard rock, prog and pop styles in a more cohesive fashion. It was also their final album with John Curulewski. Tommy Shaw came in just in time to tour with the album. <br /> <br />Three songs on this album had received FM radio airplay: Dennis DeYoung's \\"Light Up\\", Dennis DeYoung and James Young's \\"Lorelei\\", and DeYoung's epic \\"Suite Madame Blue\\". Other great songs include DeYoung and Curulewski's \\"Mother Dear\\" and DeYoung's \\"Lonely Child\\". The album also has two hard rock numbers, James Young's \\"Midnight Ride\\" and Dennis DeYoung and John Curulewski's \\"Born For Adventure\\". Curulewski's \\"Prelude 12\\" is a short acoustic piece that makes me think of the introduction of a Yes song, \\"And You and I\\". FM radio station generally play \\"Prelude 12\\" when they play \\"Suite Madame Blue\\". <br /> <br />This album proved that they were able to make great music without Tommy Shaw, just that they needed a better label. If you want to hear any pre-Tommy Shaw albums, Equinox is obviously the album to start,
B00002R0MC|5.0|wow, this cd of bob marley is amazing! <br />i love the presentation of the the they set it out. <br />i am a massive bob marley fan, name me a song and i will sing it to you, lol. <br /> <br />great worth every penny.
B00005UW9T|4.0|My girls have enjoyed this version of Anastasia for years. We find ourselves singing the songs with fond memories. Characters 'rasputin and bartok' are ridiculous and over the top, didn't like these. I do not believe this story to be accurate but nevertheless, it is a good story and has a good music soundtrack. Cusack and Ryan do a good job with Voice for the characters Anya and Dimitri. Worth a second look.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|I am a David Lynch fan big time.  Anything he puts out I know I won't be dissapointed.  I enjoy his dark and strange films like Mulholland Drive, Blue Velvet and one of my favorites Lost Highway, but this move though it was not dark or that strange was probably my favorite DL movie yet.  Rent this and watch it alone or with your family, one of the best heartfelt movies you will ever see.
6305428387|5.0|Just great- Just great!   Movie about 4 jamaican guys entering bobsled racing (started with push cart racing)- totally unrealistic I know- but happened incredibly 1988 winter olympics calgary canada with jamaica improving in subsequent years. Great comedy by these actors and the late john candy, you will never forget the name 'sanka coffee' again. Own this for your collection and you will not be sorry. Show it to friends and family for a laugh, give it for a gift. Cool runnings- yah man!
B00005RHGK|3.0|Ok, the first half of this movie was some of the best cinema I have ever seen.  The brother and sister characters had such great chemistry you really cared about both of them.  The scene on that country road was beautiful, and that filthy old truck coming up on them was enough to grab anyone's attention.  I was hooked.  But up until the time you discover who the driver of that truck is, and the mystery lady who's sole point was to explain to the audience where this thing came from and what its purpose was, it lost me.  I would still by this dvd however, I truly cannot watch it until the end it is laughable.  I give it an extra star for the first half of the film, that great truck, and the scene under the church.  Imagine if the driver of that truck would not have been what it actually was but instead a crazed serial killer with an interesting background.  I know there are those who would disagree with me and I say to them I loved the first half of this film, but the 2nd half didn't do it for me but I would still recommend it on a night when you want to see something somewhat interestingly creepy.  <br />
B0002HTZJI|3.0|What to say? I was thinking this would be a superb recording from a superb band. But what I got was something quite different. <br /> <br />My main issue is the sound quality. The band sounds like they are playing on four seperate stages, they dont sound like a band at all, more like four people just jamming. This is glaringly obvious in the first song 'Cant Stop', this is one of my favourite Chilis songs and its just bad here. John sounds like he is out of time and is trying to catch up to the rest of the band. <br /> <br />The other main issue is Anthonys vocals. Theyre just bad, as if he'd just woken up after a night on the booze. <br /> <br />Im glad I only borrowed this cd, I was thinking about buying it and Im glad I didnt waste my money
B0002234LS|2.0|Why is it when stars make it to the so called A list, they get involved with horrible films?  Johnny Depp is probably my favorite actor of all time.  If you want to see some of his great work, watch Jim Jermarsch's  (spelling) Dead Man, this was a great western or the 9th Gate another great film.   <br />But back to Secret Window, this movie started off very well, however it became very predictable Shortly after the stranger shows up.  I knew where they were going, but I hoped I was wrong.  I thought \\"Please don't go there.\\"  But of course they did and that as they say is that.  The acting in this film was excellent however so it gets 2 stars, but I really could not recommend anyone wasting money renting it.  I hope JD doesn't stop appearing in great works.  I'd like to see him work with Jim J again and also David Lynch, but that will never happen.
B000AP04FG|3.0|Great shootout Choreography. Falls into the battling relationship catagory of Tracey/Hepburn movies or the TV show moonlighting with Bruce Willis and  Cybil Shepard.  Very unrealistic- neither one gets hit after 2 million rounds of gunfire.  Also unrealistic are her lips which stand out more than the acting.
0553583182|5.0|If  you were to buy just one book to show you how to tap into the power of your subconscious mind, this would be that book. I know some companies charging $2,500 for seminars on this subject and don't cover the subconscious mind as thoroughly as this book does. <br /> <br />Dr. Murphy has written many books. This one remains his most popular and for good reason---it works! It is the most complete book on the subject of energizing the subconscious mind.  <br /> <br />The Power of Your Subconscious Mind is 275 pages and 20 chapters of very powerful information. Dr.Murphy combines time-honored spiritual wisdom with cutting-edge scientific research to explain the influence of the subconscious mind on everything you do.  <br /> <br />This book is an easy read, inspiring and offers practical and proven-effective exercises that can turn your mind into a powerful tool for improving your everyday life. One person I know describes the effect on your mind as being like going from a 486 pc to a new Pentium IV. It opens up a whole new realm of opportunity. <br /> <br />The Power of Your Subconscious Mind is like a users guide, a manual on how to operate your brain for results. This is different from NLP, PMA and other forms of mental training. It is tried, tested and proven. <br /> <br />I also recommend Dr. Murphy's other books and books like Think & Grow Rich by Napolean Hill. <br /> <br />

B00000892G|5.0|Wow. Wow. This album is easily my favorite, ever.  It truly fits Defais' own description of Virgin Steele. Barbaric Romanticism, from a whisper to a scream.  Every SECOND of this album is interesting and posessing that magic force that only the most true and commited of musicians can wield, and I'm saying this after 2 years of listening to it almost every day (or at least one song from it daily).  Invictus is an incredible set of hymns to live your life by, magic and power exists in it to the FULLEST. I really don't know what else to say, words hardly describe the feelings I get when I listen to this album.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is her best album so far.
B0000JCFPE|4.0|Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas in an erotic thriller. What better do you want from an action movie. The story is well written, enough to keep you intrigued through out all the movie. A similar movie would be 9 1/2 weeks so you get the picture. Quality of the DVD and sound is all very good. Recommended for the lover of this genre.
B000063147|4.0|I only just started listening to this band about a year ago, and all I can say is....I sure was missing out! Avenged Sevenfold have a completly unique style and sound, their simply amazing!  <br /> <br />Powerful, fast and original riffs and lead guitar solos rule in this one!!!
B000BM6AVA|2.0|I am big fan of SOAD.But after toxicity none of their album was good enough.They need to put varity on their songs.Every song seems same.Toxicity was good because of varity,but this cd on 1 or 2 songs r good.Title song ROkSSS.BUT OTHERS......!!!!Spent ur money on KORN'S new album \\"see u on other side\\".
B0001NBMBC|1.0|I've been a great Slipknot fan for many years, however not so long ago I realised that this is NOT cool. A band with 9 people jumping around headbanging and doing nothing sums up Slipknot quite nicely. Do they have any musical talent whatsoever, because all they seem to do is regurgitate the same riffs over and over, with annoying vocals and absurd lyrics.  <br /> <br />Metal bands are intelligent no matter how they portray themselves, their lyrics stand for something and musically they are able to produce roaring riffs and stunning guitar solos. When was the last time Slipknot did a guitar solo? Errr, never. Exactly. And so how cn a band be classed as Metal if they havn't once, in a career spanning nearly a decade, produced a single guitar solo? Beats me. Ok, so the masks are rather good. It's gives them originality to the way they look, but nothing else.  <br /> <br />So, Corey taylor and crew, you still have the support of millions of 13 year old wannabe goths and punks, however if you want to win back support of real metalists like me, then sort this mess out before you ruin yourselves.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|For those of you that have put down this album by saying that the quality is bad, or that his solos are dissapointing, or that John Mayer is not really that good.  First, on the quality, this is a LIVE album.  A live album is when mics are placed around the stage to pick up the sound a crowd would hear. Newsflash, most bands don't sound as good as they do on the record. I think that it was a brilliant move to release this album as a live version. On the issues of his solos, watch Mayer play his solos. Eyes shut, mouth hanging open.  He doesn't play the guitar, it is an extension of his body. For him to play a riff, it's like you and I raising our right hands. These solos are the music that is coursing through him. It is my belief that John Mayer is the reincarnation of Stevie Ray Vaughn.  Those that doubt me should listen to the whole CD.
B000001ELR|5.0|Wow, I wish I could give this 100 stars. This is one of the greatest Kiss albums I've ever listened to, alongside their other, early masterpieces. This is probably their heaviest work yet, and even with Space-Ace or Peter Criss, they do a good job. <br /> <br />Band Members: <br />Paul Stanley: Rhythm Guitar and Vocals <br />Gene Simmons: Bass and Vocals <br />Vincent Cusano (changed to Vinnie Vincent: replacement Lead Guitarist for a while <br />Eric Carr: Drums. Hard-edged, heavy and skillful drums! He makes a fine replacement for Peter Criss. <br />     ...and a few words to describe this album are: Loud, Powerful and Fantastic. <br /> <br />Creatures of the Night 100/100: Perfect opening, everything's great. Maybe the best song on the album. <br />Saint and Sinner 90/100: Not as heavy, but nonetheless killer. Gene's vocals suit the song perfectly. <br />Keep Me Comin' 91/100: A lot of people say that this is the sequel to ''Calling Dr. Love''. I think that's pretty accurate. All-around good, too. <br />Rock and Roll Hell 93/100: Heavy bass by Gene and his vocals, nice power chords on the guitars. <br />Danger 94/100: I'm amazed that Eric Carr, whose drumming is as heavy as can be, can do the opening drumroll as skillful as he can. Great song, heavy guitars and pounding drums. <br />I Love It Loud 100/100: Mostly drums with a brief guitar solo, perfect party song. This is a song that definitely says KISS!!! <br />I Still Love You 95/100: Lovely power ballad, Paul has great vocals on this. Longest song on the album, too, at over 6 minutes. <br />Killer 100/100: Dual guitar opening with more great drumming. Lyrics are very cool, as the guitars. <br />War Machine 100/100: Good way to close the album, another heavy track that's a great metal anthem. Gene's lead vocals, great guitars, too and interesting ending. <br /> <br />Overall: One of the most underrated masterpiece albums of the 80s. This opened an era of 80s metal. If you want a classic KISS collection, this is very highly recommended.
B00005ASOI|5.0|I finally got a DVD copy of Suspiria. I watched this film on VHS in the late 80's and it scared me then. It scares me even more now. Argento's technique squirms into your mind and grabs the subconscious part, filling it with horror. The choice for the films lead was great. A little frail, but a little creepy herself. Jessica Harper invested her character of Susie perfectly with a steady sense of dread and terror, reacting with just the right balance of emotion. Unlike many lead characters in horror films, Susie somehow manages to pull herself together, despite her horrid situation. I absolutely love this film. It is Argento's masterpiece.
0307276902|1.0|Although I am only on about the fourth chapter, so far, I find that the writer  is quite redundant.   It's obvious that he is just filling up pages.  For instance, (although this is not a sentence from the actual book) here's an example of the writing; \\"I got up out of my chair, and I went to the kitchen, and I grabbed a plate, and I walked over to the table, and I sat down, and I tried to eat.\\"  I find myself skipping over all the \\"ands\\" to get to the point, and do not find this read  to be a \\"can't put it down,\\" but rather a \\"get to the point.\\"   I plan to finish the book, of course, but I won't be any hurry to do so.
B000AWYOG4|3.0|I'm not talking about the previews of THIS movie. I was more scared by the previews that were shown before this movie than I was by the movie itself. It had a couple of moments that scared me, but the music in this film was misleading. It would seem that something scary was going to happen, and then nothing happened. The movie was extremely slow and anticlimactic just like (The Ring). If you want to be scared, buy (28 Days Later) on DVD. This movie was more of a tragedy then a horror. By the end, I felt sad and confused.
0380715430|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book a lot. The subject is interesting, and Bryson is a fine writer. That being said, the book really is just a long ramble. I couldn't tell you exactly what Bryson was trying to say about English, what his premise was or where he was trying to go. The book is basically a loose collection of anecdotes and fun-facts about English, with some about other languages thrown in for the purpose of contrast. I also know for a fact that some of his factual assertions are flat wrong. Now on the whole I didn't care, because I enjoyed the book with all its flaws. I feel obligated, however, to take off one star for the book's aimlessness and another star for the factual errors. That leaves three stars. I still recommend buying the book because it's a fun read. If you like Bryson's writing -and it's hard not to- then buy and enjoy this.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|A rich combination of the tried and true synthesis of the mythical American wild west and our dream of space travel, plus the concept of the free spirited hero come together to create a movie that is just plain fun.  Whether one was a fan of the television series or not, one can buy this and just watch and enjoy.  An added benefit is that it is easily this movie a few times. <br /> <br />It may not be for everyone, but I think many will be surprised that they actually find themselves caring about the characters and thinking about the future they thought of when they were kids.  Sit back and enjoy.
B0007OASII|5.0|I first heard of Kamelot right here on Amazon. It was on my recommendations list since \\"I Own\\" a lot of Savatage, Dream Theater, and Queensryche. So I checked out the samples, visited thier website, and after seeing the videos I was hooked. Santa was good to me and I got The Black Halo, Epica, Karma, and Dominion. This is a kick-butt band! The more I hear the more I like. <br /> <br />The Black Halo is my favorite right now, but that doesn't take anything away from the other releases. Khan has a very powerful and melodic voice, and it mixes perfectly with Simone Simon on \\"The Haunting.\\" My favorite track is \\"The March of Mephisto,\\" but I don't care much for the addition of Shagrath's growls. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this CD for anyone who likes symphonic metal, ie. Savatage, Jon Oliva, Dream Theater, Queensryche, or Trans-Siberian Orchestra.
0596007124|5.0|I got involved with design patterns in 1995 with the GoF book. I have learned them and used them on numerous consulting projects, and I feel I understand them pretty well. Recently I was asked to teach a Design Patterns course. The course material was excellent and very comprehensive, but I felt I needed an complementary approach for teaching that was a little lighter than the student manual. I picked up the Head First Design Patterns book, and started reading it on the flight to where I was teaching. The time flew by, and so did the pages. When I got off the plane I had read almost 300 pages. It is a really easy read. I was seriously impressed with the quality of the book's coverage, and its really excellent examples to motivate why and how each pattern can be useful. As an object modeler and architect I see way too many examples of developers using either the wrong pattern, or using a pattern just to say \\"I used the Strategy pattern!\\". The GoF book is the \\"bible\\" on DPs, but this Head First book is a superb introduction for beginners, and for veterans like me to learn something new. At the end of that DP class, several students shared that they had tried to get through the GoF book but just couldn't stay with it. After I showed them several of the examples in this book, they said they were eager to read the GoF book to get more depth.
0312305060|4.0|In the beginning this book was a little confusing. I mean it's not like the book is going to tell you that there's going to be three different stories. Of course, don't warn me or anything. Anyways, after a while I realized what was going on and it becamse a really nice story. I enjoyed it a lot.
B000BJS4TO|5.0|To the eye, director Rob Marshall produced a gorgeous painting of the Japanese landscape. To the ear, five-time Oscar winner John Williams composed a soundtrack so gorgeous, it will transport you back into this sweeping epic of the visual. Yo-Yo Ma adds to the tremendous strings with his cello solos, as does the legendary Itzhak Perlman with his solo violin selections. This is a soundtrack for one who appreciates classical music at its finest. The sounds of Eastern and Western musical influences are meticulously mixed for a classical adventure. If you're a fan of any or all of these musicians, this film soundtrack will thrill you. If you're just a fan of instrumental movie soundtracks, it's hard to go wrong with this rapturous score. This score will easily be a front-runner for the Academy Award. Take a listen and I think you'll agree. Superb!
B000A5044C|4.0|Hollywood has just released a new version of Yours, Mine and Ours (a comedy about a widow and widower, each with lots of kids, who can't find new mates because no one wants to raise those kids). Japan has released its own version of this story and it's called Nobody Knows. But this one ain't a comedy. Rather than a sugary sweet tale with a swell ending, we get a more realistic and much sadder tale of an immature and frighteningly dependent woman saddled with kids who faces a bleak future until she does the unthinkable. Despite the despicable behavior of the mom, however, Nobody Knows avoids easy answers. It brings you into the lives of this unlucky family so that you feel as though you are actually living with them and getting to know each one. The pace is deliberately slow to achieve real time immersion. If you can take it, the emotional impact is profound.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|I'm typically a fan of pop music, but when you get a collection of artists and songs this fine, it's hard to ignore. I was so engrossed in the film, the music almost seemed secondary, but coming in as first runner-up to a film as wonderful as this isn't such a bad thing. When it comes to listening to the soundtrack on its own, one wonders how some of these songs slipped under the radar. From Willie Nelson's beautiful \\"He Was A Friend Of Mine\\" and Mary McBride's \\"No One's Gonna Love You Like Me\\" to the film's haunting theme \\"A Love That Will Never Grow Old\\" with sparkling vocals by Emmylou Harris, these three songs already make the soundtrack worthy of their place in movie music history. Rufus Wainwright makes a couple of spectacular appearances with his own \\"The Maker Makes\\" and a smooth cover of the Roger Miller classic \\"King Of The Road.\\" The 20 year timeline of the film is so meticulous, even Linda Ronstadt's 1977 cherry, \\"It's So Easy\\" lives up to its title on this 17-track set. Other songs by Steve Earle, Jackie Greene and Teddy Thompson's unforgettable \\"I Will Never Let You Go,\\" as well as Gustavo Santaolalla's score, burn with such country fervor, you'll need a visit to your local watering hole for a tall cold one. I highly recommend you pick up this CD and relive the passion of Brokeback Mountain. One listen to this soundtrack and the fury of this film will stay etched in your mind and forever in your heart, that is, if it hasn't already.
B0001XALT6|5.0|This movie as of course mentioned is chock full of great actors and is verry enjoyable to watch.  However I am unsure if it's just my disc or what because the version I have scene on television has an extended ending with Freddy by the water then theres a call and him and Billy drive off but this was not in the recently purchased Collectors series DVD.  It just ends with the voice over and the media talking and then boom credits.  Anyone else notice that.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I never saw the tv-series from which this movie is based on and also was not impressed by the theatrical trailer.<br /><br />So I stumble across the DVD at Best Buy and picked up a copy just to see what all the fuss is about. I mean, I can always sell it on ebay. Well, now that I saw it, I'm going to keep the DVD and also use my gift card to buy the firefly DVD set.<br /><br />Good special effects & martial arts action, but I guess I really enjoyed it because of the story & characters.<br /><br />It has some of the Han Solo & STV Tom Paris witty dialogue. You sympathize with the Captain & his crew, especially when some of the main characters die or are near-death. The villain is very sinister, with his perfected assassination techniques and extremist religious beliefs that justify evil actions for the sake of the Alliance (or Empire for all you Star Wars fans out there).
0060930187|5.0|I expected this novel to be incredibly depressing and so had put off reading it, but I was pleasantly surprised to find how much humor it actually has. Futhermore, the writing style is crisp and concise, making it a very easy read. An interesting thing about this novel is it's incredible subtlety.  <br /> <br />While often being quite descriptive regarding events and people, the protagonist actually shares very little information about her personal thoughts and her rationalizations for her actions. Normally I would see that as a flaw but the events she narrates seem to actually speak for themselves so that we can almost guess how she must have been feeling or why she was so upset as a woman in a restrictive society who encountered several difficult relationships with men. We can see that these relationships upset her and that the social norms she imbibed growing up kept her from feeling free to express herself, leading to mental instability. This allows the reader to become more involved than is generally possible by encouraging them to fill in the blanks and analyze what is happening in order to draw conclusions about her feelings for themselves.  <br /> <br />While often interpreted as being feminist, anyone can read into the novel their own interpretations of her psychological demise based on their own experiences. For example, her type A personality and the pressure she puts on herself as an over achiever is another probable trigger for mental breakdown. Though slightly ambiguous as to the source of her depression, the symptoms of alienation and withdrawal are clearly mapped out. Even if you are unable to relate to what appears to be a self-centered, passive, depressive the symptoms are accurate and the the detached tone is an appropriate reflection of someone who is depressed since it makes sharing your feelings with the people around you so difficult. Even the choppy narration can be seen to reflect the mental instability.  <br /> <br />The lack of a fast paced plot or some kind of racy trigger for her depression highlights the fact thay anyone can become depressed seemingly without warning, and that the ordinary day to day trials of life can be just as wearing on the soul as an dramatic encounter. The overall feeling of the book is one of alienation and withdrawal from the world, yet with delightful touches of humor, written in a simple and straighforward, yet poetic manner.
B0002JJBZY|1.0|Don't bother...next year 2007 is the 40th anniversry of the original series.  Given Paramounts trackrecord, you can be sure that the whole kit-'n-kaboodle will be repackaged, and remasterd (possibly in high definition) with way more bonuses and to add insult to injury for all of us who bought previous incarnations of the original series....it probably will be cheaper!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Were you a fan of \\"Firefly\\", like me? And were you also utterly disappointed when that show was cancelled? If that is the case, this is the right movie for you. The casting is the same, as is the story, but there is a big difference between this film and the series: \\"Serenity\\" has a great ending that brings a sense of closure, without taking away the possibility of a sequel. So, thanks Joss Whedon!<br /><br />You weren't a fan of \\"Firefly\\", and you don't have the faintest idea of what that show was about? Well, it really doesn't matter, because this movie is a standalone, in the sense that even though you may understand the characters better if you watch the dvd of the series, you don't need to it to enjoy the movie. However, if you enjoy \\"Serenity\\" I highly recommend you to buy the dvd of \\"Firefly\\" as soon as possible. This film is really great, but the series rocks too!<br /><br />This sci-fi Western has a great plot, lots of action, and quite a few oneliners that will make you laugh. Is it a surprise that I heartily recommend it?<br /><br />Belen Alcat
B000BNI90O|5.0|This set hasn't left my sight since I got it.  We got the last copy Best Buy here had.  This set includes a lot of songs I never thought would be on a cd, including the song the hobbits sing in the Green Dragon and some of the songs sung by the elves, including \\"Lament for Gandalf\\" and \\"Anron.\\"  The quality is excellent, I haven't tried it yet with a surround sound system, but it was wonderful in my car stereo!  I can't wait for the next two!
0553212478|4.0|Frankenstein is a little book that is a very creditable effort for a nineteen-year-old author to have written. It is not a masterpiece, per se, and it bears almost no relation to the famous Universal films. The style is very 19th century, with florid prose, melodrama, and epistles, but it isn't boring (nor is it particularly scary). You'll be better off having read it than not, however, and it'll take a day at most.
B00062J00S|5.0|Although this movie is way before my time and I wasted nearly 30 years of my life without seeing it, \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" is remarkably believable, touching, and soulful.  I haven't seen many \\"classic\\" films, but Jimmy Stewart is just a wonderful dramatic actor and this story is one that everyone should see.  The basic plot reveals that every person touches someone else in life and that what we do affects other people, even though we may not realize it. If you ever feel down, somewhat worthless, or need a pick-me-up, you should watch this movie.  The spirit of the movie never gets old and should be retold again and again.
B000AGTPUK|1.0|Admittedly, the movie is pretty to look at.  The music is OK, even though it frequently becomes faux Lloyd Webber, and he is faux enough all by himself.  What I find objectionable is the theme:  constantly the movie hammers in a theme of \\"believe\\" as a good thing, when what the world needs now is more people who question.  Mere \\"belief\\" leads to suicide bombers and airplane hijackers and is responsible for most of what is wrong in our world today.  Toward the end of the film the conductor says \\"What's important is to decide to get on the train, no matter where it's going.\\"  A pernicious doctrine if I ever heard one!
B000A0GP0Y|5.0|A lot of people think that this is a pointless remake, but I liked it. Of course, I've never seen the original. I'm just an Adam Sandler fan and this movie was not lacking his humor. Of course he's more serious in this movie, and the whole movie is more serious, it still had some parts that would never happen in real life, and they were put in for comedy purposes. I liked this movie, and I would recommend it to any Adam Sandler fan or someone who is looking for a good movie.
B000BB1MI2|3.0|I'm a big fan of Tim Burton and of Johnny Depp, however, not so much in this film. Johnny Depp came off as a very perverse man, who had an abnormal aversion to other adults. His role made me feel very unsettled. I was not happy about his little psychiatric sessions either. <br /> <br />This version was close to the original film, and yet in many ways was truer to the book. HOWEVER, it really missed the boat on the magical, whimsical take with it's techno oopma loompas, the aggro Mike Teevee etc. That aspect was more for older teens/adults. I admit there were quite a few \\"laugh-out-loud\\" moments, but this films is not a children's classic like the original.  <br /> <br />In the original, Gene Wilder was odd, but in a very innocent way.  <br />I loved the talk he had with Charlie at the end of the film. He was kind and had kind eyes, whereas Johnny Depp had something sinister always brewing... YIKES! (hence the Michael Jackson comparison). My favorite all time part of the original is when Gene Wilder sings \\"Pure Imagination\\". It's pure magic. All the actors in the original were so stellar... including the parents. <br /> <br />This version is not for young children.
B000002BMV|5.0|The 80's gave us much to be thankfull for musicaly. With the emergency of MTV,new wave,punk rock & the beginings of Alternative music. The 80's were much like the sixtys in that rock & roll was taking the next step in music evolution.During this period you still had great bands that had begun in the 70's and were still having some success in the early to mid 80's. Of these bands Journey emerged with there definning album ESCAPE.This is the album that pretty much made them a househlod name.Five out of the ten songs on this album were hits,DONT STOP BELIEVIN',STONE IN LOVE,WHO'S CRYING NOW,STILL THEY RIDE & of course the biggest hit OPEN ARMS. The Album is pretty much flawless. Other great albums would follow during this period, FRONTIERS & RAISED ON RADIO,(RAISED ON RADIO was pretty much all steve perry)but this was the album that first really got everyone's attention. If you are just discovering this band for the first time this is the place to start, this is the album that defined them as a great rock & roll band. They dont make bands like this anymore do they? Rock & Roll,(MUSIC) if done right should move you,inspire you, Define you as a person.John Lennon once siad, \\"that an artist job is to convey to the world what everyone is thinking & feeliing\\", I feel this album does just that.
B000BEZPQE|5.0|This album is the best it's loud and tight and is the closest to Slipknot live you can get. The quality is excellent. Anyone that puts it down is not a fan and they have no reason reviewing it.
0805076476|5.0|Reading this book is like having your skull smashed against a cement floor in the basement of a seedy bar. It's written as though somebody jumped off a 100 storey building and wrote the entire book before he hit the ground.  <br />This book is not for the faint of heart. <br />Nevertheless, I think it's amazing. It blew my mind, plucked me off the cosy little couch I'd curled up on, spun me aroud, shook me up good and hard, and put me gently back down, completely rattled. This is not an epic story, nothing life-changing, but it'll definitely change the way you look at the world. The violence and the detachment from it (no vivid imagery here, no compromises, just the cold hard edges) make for an unforgettable book. <br />And, yes, I happen to like the movie too.
0393312836|3.0|I can honestly say that this book is unlike any other I have read.  The style of narration told through the eyes of the main character--an invented slang derived as a mix of english and slavic language--keeps the reader's attention on the events of the story.  It creates a reaction time effect, wherein the reader will pause for a moment before the shocking reality of the story unfolding finally takes hold.  And their is plenty of shock: Burgess spares no detail while dictating the horrible reality of urban violence.   <br /> <br />Burgess suggests that some are inherently given to violence and innocent in their desire for it.  He ponders the subject of choice: is it better to choose evil than be forced into good?--does a man cease to be a man when that choice is taken from him? <br /> <br />Overall these questions are compelling and the frankness of the storyline gives the message a powerful effect.  But the reader gets the sense that some aspects of violence and adolescence are left wanting something more.  Burgess suggests that the innocent inclination to violence fades with age, but why is this characteristic limited to adolescence?  Why in adolescence to begin with? <br /> <br />\\"A Clockwork Orange\\" is compelling, but much of the plot is left underdeveloped.  Interesting and hard to put down, but it's effect, like the violence of adolescence...fades with time.  <br />
0743455967|5.0|As an aspiring novelist, I found this book very helpful. King takes us into the process of writing a novel from conception, where he sits down to come up with the plot, what if this, what if that, to an actual look at edited pages of his work, to the final product.<br /><br />This is one of the most unique how to books on writing to be found. King invites the reader in to his early days when being a writer was a pipe dream to the day he got the phone call that his novel Carrie had finally sold.<br /><br />I found this book to be encouraging in the publishing world where discouragement runs rampant. To know the best-selling author of all time had to go through the rejection rite of passage and still has bouts of self-doubt, give this writer hope.<br /><br />Besides being informative, this book was one of the most entertaining reads in this genre I've come across.<br /><br />A great read for aspiring authors and King fans that want to get to know the man behind the pen.<br /><br />Reviews [...]
0451191153|5.0|You may or may not be aware of the controversy surrounding this work.  The Fountanhead is Rand's introduction to a bold philosophy called \\"Objectivism.\\"  In short is values the will and ego of the individual over all, purporting that every action, every decision be given to a purpose solely in the interest of he who makes it.   <br /> <br />It is a novel about Howard Roark, an architect of Rand's perfect objectivist design.  Roark will not, and perhaps cannot stray from the height of individual integrity; he acts for himself and one desire: to build.   <br /> <br />His character demands that he refuse to compromise on matters of his work.  He pioneers a new and asthetically beautiful architecture, one that is mechanically efficient and devoid of visual fanfare.  He also lives in a time where innovation is shunned in favor of variation on the old themes: roman, rennaisance, gothic.  He is beaten and driven to poverty by those who wish to see him fail, those who play to the public's desire for vanity.   <br /> <br />In short it is a story of the genius of an individual against the insistence of the collective.  It will challenge one's perception of the ego, of altruism, and of humanity itself--no matter what is made of it after all is said and done.   <br /> <br />The most persistent criticism of this monumental work is its lack of compassion.  Many complain that the characters are cold.  In fact, their compassion is subtle, but often more compelling than literature's most fabled heroes.   <br /> <br />If you plan to tear through this novel then do not bother--it requires time as does any type of digestion.  It will force you wrench out any sliver of certainty you may have ever had about how to live one's life.  The most egregarious mistake you could make interpreting this novel is to assume that it is cold, it teaches how to live.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Great fun popcorn flick, even if you are not familiar with the series. The \\"ballet-fu\\" (term coined in a critic's review) is great to watch. It has humor and action and poignancy, and will have you rooting for the little guys going up against the big bad corp. If you've seen Four Brothers, it will be a hoot to see the bad guy from that film (thug) as the bad guy, albeit a very different bad guy, here (this is the same actor who is the good guy in Dirty Pretty Things--versatile dude). I LOVE the serenity crew and hope to see more stories in the future (even if they are on tv)....
B000002GVO|5.0|This album (c.d) is almost thirty years old and when I play it it is still just as good as the first time I heard it. <br /> #1 song Hotel California-just a great song. <br />
B00000099Y|5.0|I won't bother going into details as to why I like this so much.  Besides, with over 1000 reviews, who's going to read this anyway.<br /><br />I own around 400 albums, and in my humble opinion this is the greatest album I have ever heard.  The complexity of the music and lyrics, combined with the sound quality, production values, and music talent is beyond anything else recorded, to date.  I cannot fully explain why I think it's the greatest.  It's more of my gut feeling.  So, I won't bother writing a long review, because you've already made up your mind anyway.
B0007TKNII|3.0|The inarguable victory of this 2004 film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's record-breaking stage hit is the artistry behind the elaborate sets, which can be credited primarily to art director Anthony Pratt and set decorator Celia Bobak. Otherwise your enjoyment of the film will depend on how much you love Lloyd Webber's music and the rapt romanticism at the heart of the old Gaston Leroux story. Personally, I much prefer the sheer musicality of Rodgers and Hammerstein, the razzle-dazzle of Ebb and Kander or the incisive witticism of Sondheim before giving a listen to Lloyd Webber's mostly overwrought work. His personal stamp is so indelible here that director Joel Schumacher's chief role seems to be to not get in the way with his own well-known commercially driven and often artistically deprived instincts.<br /><br />Regardless, I have to give credit to Lloyd Webber for his original inspiration to transform a standard horror story with Freudian implications into a swooning romantic operetta. On that level, the story succeeds in both live and filmed versions. Unfortunately, the journey from stage to screen is far more problematic beginning with the 1980's-sounding musical arrangements which severely date the movie. Surprisingly, no effort was made to update the sound of several musical numbers that have insistent electronic drum beats more fitting in a Studio 54-type venue. Another problem is the black-and-white framing device set in 1919 that Schumacher uses to treat the 1870-set story like a memory flashback. This technique is overused not only at the beginning and the end but at various unnecessary points throughout the film. Moreover, the movie feels overlong at 143 minutes, as Schumacher's storytelling feels lethargic and oddly underdeveloped, especially when compared to a live performance. There is a feeling of endlessness during the final stretch that proves exhausting despite the melodramatic resolution.<br /><br />Casting is also a challenge here but not because the three leads, all talented singers, are relative newcomers to films. Gerard Butler has the unenviable task of attempting to eradicate Michael Crawford's legendary stage performance as the Phantom. He is a rather lunkish presence for such a dashing, shadowy figure, and as a singer, he is somewhat of a shouter unable to display much emotional nuance. Butler becomes more effective in the final act but merely because he seems liberated after his character's unmasking. As the pursued Christine, Emmy Rossum is a lovely presence with a bright, bell-like soprano singing voice. Interestingly though, she is more successful as an actress than a singer here since her arias feel somewhat vacuous and worse, start to feel repetitive as the movie goes on. Patrick Wilson - memorable as the closeted Joe Pitt in Mike Nichols' \\"Angels in America\\" - has the looks and voice to play Raoul effectively, but he seems misguided here as his character alternates between heroism and vengeance in a mercurial fashion that should be reserved for the Phantom.<br /><br />Far more effective in supporting roles are  Miranda Richardson as Madame Giry, the woman who seems to know all the secrets; Ciar&aacute;n Hinds and Simon Callow as Firmin and Andre, the new owners of the Opera House; and Minnie Driver at her most flamboyantly comical as the reigning opera diva Carlotta speaking a most unrecognizable Neapolitan accent. Ultimately, the Baroque nature of the film's story, coupled with its gothic setting, still feels at odds with the Broadway-style musical numbers with the exception of the lovely rooftop duet between Rossum and Wilson on \\"All I Ask of You\\", as beautiful a ballad to come from Lloyd Webber as any of his other hits. At the same time, those who were enthralled with the stage version should find enough to please them with this version. For me, it was simply an underwhelming experience.leads, all talented singers, are relative newcomers to films.

It's VERY educational and eye-opening.  It deals with so many different areas of sickness.  I would recommend this book but not to the faint of heart.

1896597890|4.0|Guy Delisle, a French-Canadian illustrator who had the great fortune to spend two months in North Korea, has produced a charming and funny book about what happened during his stay. In truth, not much did happen to him. He was shadowed by guides and translators pretty much wherever he went and no North Korean dared talk to him about what living conditions were really like. So don't expect sensations, just a well-told (but curiously for a professional artist, not a brilliantly drawn) account of his time there. We see first-hand the frustrations of working in a town with little food, little power and virtually nothing to do apart from hang out with the small community of foreign aid workers and business executives. Highly recommended.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|Things you will notice while watching this DVD:  (1) these guys look old (that's OK, they ARE old), (2) It doesn't matter a whit because they can still make a godalmighty racket as of yore, but with more control, (3) Jack Bruce is a helluva bass player and a damn fine vocalist to boot, (4) Eric Clapton plays with a fire and a passion you haven't heard for a looong time, (5) they smile at each other a lot, and (6) Ginger Baker plays with his jeans rolled up below the knee.  That last point is too silly to make, but too late.   <br /> <br />The Royal Albert Hall is packed. The stage set is spartan, though a psychedelic backdrop pulsates with trippy sixties eye-candy throughout the show.  Clapton plays a black Strat with a well-worn maple neck (a 2nd black maple-neck Strat setup for slide is used for \\"Rolling and Tumbling\\") through a small arsenal of open-backed combo-style amps, Bruce a pair of basses, a fretted Gibson and a fretless model I couldn't make out the name of through a group of Hartke cabinets.  His vocals, once he gets warmed up, are full of authority and the years have added even more depth and soul to his delivery.  Clapton's few lead vocals show him to be at the top of his form as a singer; it took years for him to come into his own as a vocalist and at this stage of the game there's no question but that he's got the goods.  As a guitarist he plays this show as if possessed.  If his latter solo recordings have left you wondering whether \\"God\\" really is dead, this show will dispel your wonder in short order, and put a new wonder in its place: the wonder inspired by a tonal command and a  finger technique that demonstrate beyond doubt the reason for that infamous God-graffiti in the first place.  <br /> <br />There are a few surprises: the inclusion of \\"Pressed Rat and Warthog\\", the strangest song in the Cream catalog and possibly one of the strangest songs of the Sixties (a decade whose soundtrack features no shortage of strange songs), the fantastically intense \\"We're Going Wrong\\" which closes the first disc another.  Long a favourite of mine, the demo version included on the \\"Those Were the Days\\" CD boxed set is one of the highlights of that set. As performed at the Royal Albert Hall it is a tour-de-force of mood and dynamic; Bruce's vocal is fully realized, Clapton's fiery lead lines apocalyptic, and Baker's drumming like the advance-by-stealth of massed armies in the dark of night.  This DVD demonstrates for posterity why Cream was and is utterly unique.
B00006GFAB|3.0|first off, i didn't buy this album. im sure it is a decent compilation. but my point is tht kiss have made maybe 12 greatest hits albums. another thing is that kiss is the most comercial band ever to be formed (you can buy a coffin with them on it!). they obviously just wanna rip off fans anyway they can. the only reason to buy this is if you don't know kiss to much yet, or you are a brain washed kiss zombie who will buy anything with their name on it.
B00005MP58|5.0|Before giving this review such a title, I waited and waited for the new Keira Knightly \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" to come out in the theatres.  You can see my review of that on its page.<br /><br />But in all honesty, I can now say that this is the best Pride & Prejudice I have seen.  It holds as true to the book as cinematically possible.  The acting is spot-on.  It's obvious that each actor took the time and really got to know their characters inside and out, adding little nuances that were incredibly interesting to watch.<br /><br />I don't understand what the people who are saying it's bad picture quality are seeing.  I haven't had any problems with my DVD and my television.  It looks incredibly rich and full.  I really was impressed.<br /><br />In short, this is an amazing version of the classic Jane Austen novel that will leave men and women alike interested in further reading (and watching) Jane Austen.  It had that affect on my husband and I!

I must say that this is the album that got me into rap music. 5 years on with classics such as Illmatic, All Eyez On Me in my CD rack, this album still has the dopest lyrics in the game. Em tells us his feelings about his life, wife and much other stuff. Great songs include Marshall Mathers were he raps about how nobody cared for him before he was famous and on the Way I Am he tells how people wanna hate on him but he don't care. Love this album to death! <br /> <br />Top 5: <br /> <br />Marshall Mathers <br />The Way I Am <br />Kim <br />Bitch Please II <br />Criminal <br /> <br />
B00005JOHI|3.0|I am a Jane Austen freak. I love her novels.<br /><br />I am ALSO a HUGE fan of the Pride & Prejudice mini-series with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. It has to be one of the most watched sets of DVDs in my collection.<br /><br />That said, I was expecting to go into this movie and be disappointed. I mean, it was hard enough to adapt the novel into a nearly 6 hour mini series. How in the world would they get it down to 2 hours and 7 minutes? Would it be Jane Austen on speed?<br /><br />I must say, though I was not thoroughly pleased (though I expected I would not be), I was most certainly not disappointed either! :o) All the acting was well done. It was interesting to see different takes on the Bennett girls. After time, I adjust to Keira Knightley's portrayal of Elizabeth Bennett. McFadden wasn't broody enough in my opinion. He just seemed shy more than proud. I must give much credit to my enjoyment of the acting to Mr Bingley. He was PERFECT. :) Yadda yadda yadda. You'll all form your own opinions.<br /><br />My only qualms with the film was the beautiful shots of the country/Lizzie. They were too long! Beautiful, but too long. I think SO much character development/relationship development could have been helped if they would have taken a few less of those shots, and had another family scene. I really missed Lizzie and Jane's relationship. Wickham was nearly cut out! I missed the culture of the time! The lack of showing this really destroyed a lot of Jane Austen's disdain for the upper crust of society.<br /><br />So I'm rambling, but that's how I feel in a nutshell!
0553277472|2.0|Pirsig provides a heavy inquiry into the nature of science, philosohpy, quality and pursuit of universal truth in this book. He uses a \\"scientific method\\" in describing his inquiry. Being a scientist myself, I found his book disappointing. I was excited in the topics he pursued, but there are some flaws in his reasoning that are hidden in his heavy language --- these flaws amount simply to rhetoric in retrospect. To provide an example of such flaws, consider what Phaedrus, his alter-ego, says about the nature of scientific truths and scientific methods. <br /> <br />Phaedrus postulates that the number of scientific hypotheses to explain a given worldly phenomenon increases with the amount of exploration. As you apply scientific method to test a hypothesis, new hypotheses develop. Thus, Phaedrus feels that all these hypotheses can never be tested because the number to be tested grows at a faster rate with the number being tested. He quotes Einstein to sum this up, to conclude that (scientific) truth is a function of time -- at any given moment, there is one amongst a set of hypotheses that best explains a phenomenon.  <br /> <br />But, from here, Phaedrus makes the statement that \\"the time spans of scientific truths are an inverse function of the intensity of scientific effort\\". This claim, to me, is unsubstantiated. Phaedrus seems to justify this claim by saying that as <br />more hypotheses come into existence, the probability that the leading hypothesis (call it the momentary truth referred to by Einstein) is replaced by a new hypothesis is greater because the number of alternatives is greater.  <br /> <br />The primary flaw in reasoning is that it ignores that the quality or soundness of the available hypotheses. In other words, they are all equivalent and the probability of one replacing the other are all equal. I prefer to resort to an alternative explanation of this phenomenon. Let an n-dimensional space represent all the scientific hypotheses offered to explain a phenomenon. If there does exist a scientific truth (let's call this our goal), that is <br />irrefutable, then it must be a point in this space, and reaching this point is the objective of all scientific methods. At a given instant in time, we may be aware of a set of hypotheses (or points in this space), and we know that one point in this space refers to the momentary truth referred to by Einstein. <br /> <br />What Phaedrus seems to ignore is that good scientific methods at a given instant in time will use its current knowledge (i.e., points in the space we are aware of) to guide its exploration through this space. This is the foundation of any good scientific research. Take any article written in a scientific journal, and you will find a section dedicated to related research, which considers what hypotheses have been discovered, and how does the new hypothesis presented compare with the previous results. The result of using current knowledge is to fine-tune the exploration of the hypotheses space. Thus, the aim of research is to figure out what parts of this space may be meaningless to pursue (in other words, what new hypotheses are probably weaker in the test of time), and thus turn in the direction of the hypothesis that will stand the test of time. This direction, hopefully, is towards the point that we have set as our goal. Thus, from this standpoint, our path through this space will be fine-tuned with time and will in fact increase our chances of reaching our goal. The weakness in Phaedrus argument is his own critique on the <br />\\"romantic\\" method --- he feels overwhelmed with new hypotheses that pop up all the time. In feeling overwhelmed, he gets dis-oriented, and loses sight of our current path in this space. <br /> <br />A classic example of this space is our drive to explain gravity in the cosmos. What we know today about Newton's laws of gravity and all other physical laws that are based on it, are that they are observable only on Earth. There isa new approach, string theory, that attempts to tie in gravity with the rest of our physical laws. This is a scientific inquiry into describing a new hypothesis to replace old ones (Newton's laws). We are not being overwhelmed by new hypotheses as time progresses. In fact, Newton's laws are still the best hypotheses explaining the physical phenomenon at this point in eternity. Perhaps, it will be replaced if string-theory researchers encounter a break-through, but this will imply that it is a much stronger hypothesis than Newton's. To Phaedrus, the sheer abundance of new hypotheses is a disappointment.  <br /> <br />Hence, I dismiss Phaedrus's claim that \\"time spans of scientific <br />truths are an inverse function of the intensity of scientific effort\\" as pure rhetoric without any basis. In fact, if intensity of scientific effort is well directed, then it provides better focus for our exploration through this space. Thus, I cannot but dismiss the remainder of Phaedrus argument in this chapter relating to \\"the predicted results and actual results of scientific inquiry being diametrically opposite\\", etc. All these corollaries are based on poorly deduced claim. <br /> <br />However, there are still a number of very interesting contemplations in the book. I only have trouble with the method of analysis chosen by Pirsig. Ask any scientist and they'll tell you that the most beautiful theorems and laws are the simplest ones. In this regard, Phaedrus's convoluted, heavy analysis fails miserably. It is because of the heavy analysis, that he is able to introduce rhetoric without the reader being even aware of it.
B000002WPI|5.0|This album introduced the world to the Wu-Tang Clan, a group that, along with it's affiliates, houses some of the greatest lyricists in all of hip-hop. That alone is enough to warrant all the praise this album gets, from hip-hop heads to people whose only exposure to rap is the Wu-Tang Clan. But, this is most definitely their best release as a group, and an album that spawned many classic solo albums later on, as well as the excellent Wu-Tang Forever album.  <br /> <br />Every song on this LP is classic, simple as that. There's not one skippable song on the whole album, which truly does say a lot. All 9 MC's shined on here, although some more than others, and this launched a whole new era of rap that would also bring us the likes of Nas, AZ, Notorious B.I.G., Smif N' Wessun, Mobb Deep, and other gritty New York artists, who owned the whole East Coast, as well as a majority of the rap game. <br /> <br />It's hard to say any track is better than another on this album, but there are a few which are undeniably perfect, such as C.R.E.A.M., Proteck Ya Neck, and Can It All Be So Simple. Don't get me wrong though, each of these songs is perfect - those three just stick out the most often in your memory, and have been sampled and remix time and time again. <br /> <br />If you don't have this album, you don't know what you're missing. The Wu-Tang Clan is where it's at; no doubt about it. Pick this up ASAP.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I've come to realized over the last few weeks that my favorite shows have a lot in common with my favorite books...that is, the storytelling.  The truly outstanding shows (that are often cancelled) have the ongoing storytelling quality that I love.  Most television writers these days lack the storytelling \\"gene\\" for lack of a better word.  We can probably name the ones currently with this skill on one hand.  Joss Whedon, Michael Strahczinsky, um.........and storytelling is what makes us go back and read stories over and over again. It is what makes us watch the same movie or tv series repeatedly...it's the story telling.  You have to be drawn into the \\"universe\\", you have to care about the characters and want to know them better. Whedon accomplishes this in the series and in the movie also.  You want to know what happens in their lives, what their hopes and dreams are and when they fail, you cry.  Excellent series, excellent acting, writing, all of it.
1401206905|5.0|Gotham City.<br /><br />Let's say you're a teenage girl, born in the teeming, drug-addicted, crime-ridden slums of Gotham's East End. Let's say your name is \\"Kitty\\", your daddy ran off when you were 5, and your mama doesn't get home until 2 in the morning, if she gets home at all.<br /><br />Let's say one night last week you were down the 75th, with Vera and Hopie and Star, and you meet the pimp everybody calls \\"Stoolie\\". Stoolie wants you to turn tricks for him, and---hey, it's a living---but you don't like the way he looks at ya.<br /><br />So you say no, and he gives you a nasty purple scar across your cheek: from then on, all the other whores call you \\"Scarface\\". You don't dare tell the cops, not the Gotham cops, because Stoolie pays them early and often in greenbacks.<br /><br />Or let's say you're a young cop: freshly minted Gotham police lieutenant Jim Gordon, hired sight unseen into Gotham's Finest, with a worried wife and a baby on the way. You're a smart kid: it doesn't take long to realize *everybody* is on the take: the Mayor, Commissioner Loeb, even your partner, Detective Flass.<br /><br />Especially Flass.<br /><br />So maybe you go along to get along, right, Lt. Gordon?<br /><br />Let's say you're Bruce Wayne: scion to the Wayne Industries fortune, international playboy and jet-setter, happy wanderer, Gotham's Native Son returned home from traveling about the world. You give good interview, you wine and dine starlets and models, you donate early and often to Gotham charities, you support the Mayor & Chief of Police and then retire behind the machiolations and high walls of Wayne Manor---because even if you can't spread a little of the virtue out, you can keep the Evil from getting in, right?<br /><br />Wrong.<br /><br />You spend some downtime on your knees before the twin tombstones of your parents' graves. You ask yourself what you could have done---in that alleyway, so many years ago, practically smelling the chordite off the gunman's muzzle---to have saved them.<br /><br />And then you figure: f*ck it, there are others I can save. You don tights. You get a cape. You hone to perfection the martial arts you've picked up in Kuan-Tikal, Kathmandu, Bangkok, Kansas City. You invest a chunk of the fortune you hold in a vast multi-national conglomerate into your utility belt, into razor-tooth bat-a-rangs, into handy-dandy thermite, into grappling hooks.<br /><br />You plan to move in quick, dark, lethal, and scary: because Evil may run Gotham, but in running the City it has grown fat and lethargic and complacent. Time for a little shake-up.<br /><br />You became the Night made Flesh: you become Justice, shrieking from the moon-haunted sky, Terror from the Shadows.<br /><br />You become The Batman.<br /><br />Frank Miller's \\"Batman: Year One\\" makes a delicious little book-end to \\"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns\\": written about the same time, Frank Miller ceded artistic duties to David Mazzuchelli, who brings a kind of pulpy, old-school heft to The Batman's freshman year. \\"Year One\\"---though it's fraught with issues that strike to the core of Batman: innocence lost, death, corruption---is the Dark Knight with all of the burning, ferocious idealism and none of the baggage: it's \\"Dark Knight Returns\\" without the bitterness and arthritis.<br /><br />It really rocks.<br /><br />For one thing, the Deluxe Edition---hardbound, with paper that really showcases those gorgeous inks and nice interplay of light and shadow---is a thing of beauty. Miller knows when to delegate, and his decision to let Mazzuchelli take the artistic helm was a stroke of genius: his Batman, all muscled sinew and sharp, hard, dark edges, works against the rush-hour cess of downtown Gotham. It recalls the edgy pulpiness of David Lloyd's work in \\"V for Vendetta\\": it exudes a pulpy nether-world of few options and open-air corruption. It's gorgeous work.<br /><br />But it gives Miller some breathing room: \\"Year One\\" is very much a companion piece to \\"DKR\\", and the by-product of that freedom is the depth given to Batman's forever ally, Jim Gordon. Gordon gets the rich characterization demanded---and denied---in Chris Nolan's recent \\"Batman Begins\\", emerging as a creature just as driven by justice and integrity as Batman, but one working from a position with much more to lose.<br /><br />The world of \\"Batman Year One\\" is one in which the vigilantes are just men who are forced to take the law---what little is left of it---into their own hands: the one, to prevent the horror that was done to him as a child, the other, to prevent that same horror from devouring his own child.

B0007O38F8|3.0|Alrite now most of the reviews for this either love 50 or hate him so I'm gonna try n give a non bias review that is helpful to all. This album has it's moments, not very often but it does. After GRODT it was always gonna be hard to beat and I'm sorry to say he has gone incresingly backwards. There are too many R&B songs which is fine for an artist like Diddy but when you criticise Ja Rule for doing the same it's a bit off. The gangsta tracks are tight but he sticks to the same formula as GRODT but jus doesn't do it as well. Standout tracks are Baltimore Love Thing, Ski Mask Way and I'm Supposed To Die Tonight. However these are basically Many Men, Heat and What Up Gangsta. Again he comes with the club bangers which is good. Outta Control is hot and a great song to get down to. This is an ok album but don't expect a classic or tight lyrics. If thats what your after go and pick up his mixtapes where he stays street. I hate 50 for selling out but it's not as bad as others make out. <br /> <br />Top 5: <br /> <br />Baltimore Love Thing <br />Gunz Come out <br />I'm Supposed To Die Tonight <br />Outta Control <br />Ski Mask Way

Well, Steve Austin was just plain COOL!

B00008DDSC|5.0|To be blunt, I am all for any book or movie that pushes the envelope and opens people's eyes to the S&M lifestyle. It is not for everyone, and that is fine but I really hate the way people can judge about topics they are not educated in.  <br /> <br />This movie is fabulous, Maggie Gylenhaal is amazing and James Spader plays the perfect kinky older man who does not know how to deal with his fetish for submissive women. <br /> <br />The only part I did not like was the 3 day \\"strike\\" where Maggie sits in the chair with her hands on the table. Aside from the fact that 3 days without water would kill you, this kind of S&M act does seem fat too extreme for me...still, each to their own. <br /> <br />I work as a professional bondage rigger/porn director/sex educator and feel this movie was a step in the right direction.
0060899190|3.0|The book is good but not what I expected. I was a bit dissapointed because i had already seen almost all of the postcards on the web previously. I thought the book was going to be never before seen secrets.
1591396190|5.0|In this capitalist nation (world) it is very difficult to think of competing with the \\"big boys\\" of whatever industry it is you are in. Blue Ocean Strategy shares case study after case study of companies that have found a niche in the market place, or a group of people that are not being catered too and created a successful business model as a result. <br /> <br />The book is a little repetitive but I think that is more because the authors are really trying to drill this phenomenon into the readers head. Personally I am hooked and will be applying this book to any of my futuire business ideas.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Before I write this review I will admit that I had never even heard of Firefly up until Serenity came out.  Well, I had heard about it, but it disappeared before my age/maturity came about in order to truely understand it.  I never watched it... there, I said it.  Putting all that aside though; <br /> <br />  Serenity has by far been the best movie I've seen in quite some time.  That's not to say that other movies aren't as good, but this movie had everything I'd been looking for.  Futuristic Sci-Fi, gun fights, space-ships, zombie-like creatures, a ninja(what else would you call him?), and good old mature humor. <br /> <br />  The story of Serenity, as seen by someone who has not experienced Firefly yet, can be seen as a story of freedom.  Several people crew a ship, Serenity, and fly around space committing random felonies for money.  Though they are \\"bank robbers\\" they are not ruthless people.  They simply look-out for themselves and those closest to them.  It's shown that they do care about people in general through-out the movie, but they tend to only look out for those that fly with them. <br /> <br />I won't get too into the storyline (I do have to get back to work =P), but I can assure you that other reviews have.  My reasons for this review are simply to let you know that the movie doesn't have to have a rapper in it to be good.  It doesn't need a truck-load of big names to be good.  It doesn't need a lot of dramatic pauses and tacked-on Hollywood messages to be good. <br /> <br />What a move needs to be good is what Serenity has to offer.  Greats actors and actresses that work well together off screen and on screen.  One deep and constant message instead of several messages thrown together.  Zombie-like creatures.  And the desire to make you seek humanity where ever you can find it. <br /> <br />If you're more in to Honda's with three foot spoilers and cheesey lines about racing, you probably won't like this movie... you've probably never even heard of it.But for the \\"some of us\\"... the \\"please, God, not another car chase!\\"s... the \\"just cause he can rap doesn't mean he can act\\"s... the \\"if it's got that much hype, it'll probably suck\\"s among us, I recommend this movie.  Not only will you enjoy it, but you may damn well find yourself kicking your ass for not watching Firefly.
B000063JDE|5.0|I would love to delve into David Lynch's mind for a few days, weeks or months. He is amazing. Blue Velvet raises all sorts of questions; from the rape scene (which could be seen as either very disturbing or absolutely hilarious) to Kyle McLachlan struggling with the idea of hitting a woman (who appear to enjoy it). <br /> <br />Overall, very erotic and entertaining.
B00005JO1Y|2.0|that's the sound of this clunky, heavy-pawed remake.<br /><br />I was fully expecting to love Peter Jackson's \\"King Kong\\", despite the fact that literally everyone I know who saw it could not stop mentioning how L-O-N-G it seemed.  Since several of my all-time favorite films clocked in at the over three-hour-mark (\\"2001\\", \\"The English Patient\\", \\"Magnolia\\"), these warnings didn't faze me in the least.  Now how could I have forgotten my reaction that gargantuan Sominex tablet called \\"Lord of the Rings\\"?  By the time Kong's slender plot had crawled its way to the Skull Island scenes, all of which went on f-o-r-e-v-e-r, my brain had gone completely numb.<br /><br />A big part of the problem is the acting, which ranges from  okay (Naomi Watts), to boring (Adrian Brody, as fascinating as watching paint dry), to the just plain dreadful Jack Black, who has mastered one of Nicholson's puzzled sneers which he uses continuously.  How did these people get cast?  What was Jackson instructing them to do?  I didn't believe or care about any one of them.  In fact, the best actor in the movie is the giant, computer-generated monkey.  Without characters that inspire our understanding, interest or empathy, and without any intelligent attempt to tell a story logically, all there is to sustain the audience's involvement are the endless special effects, which are so interminably focused-on that even they become snoozers and start to appear phony.<br /><br />In my opinion, all movemakers should be required to take and pass a course called \\"Alfred Hitchcock 101\\" before producers give them a dollar.  Now there was a director who knew how to tell a story, create suspense, and how much to show and to NOT show the viewer!  And despite his reported disdain for actors, even the worst people in a Hitchcock film could plow over the pathetic performers in \\"King Kong\\".<br /><br />Bad, bad monkey!  Bad, bad film-making!
B00005UE6T|5.0|I am not a fan of drugs. Drug use offends me greatly and this movie displays explicit drug use in a very \\"in your face\\" way BUT it is so well shot, and well cut that I wasn't offended but rather fascintaed. What i really like is that this movie does not romanticize drug use (quite the opposite) and has fabulous character developement. It is very easy for us to see a drug dealer/user as a bad person and nothing more. Requiem for a Dream delves more into the hopes and dreams of it's characters and force3s the viewer to see them as real people...not just addicts. I have watched this movie 5 times, and I love it every time. Superb casting also.
B00005JO1Y|2.0|Granted I've never been a fan of Peter Jackson, I still had high hopes for this remake of the 1933 classic. While I loved the original, I thought, with today's technology, and a theatrical trailer that actually looked good, this remake would have been great! And it would have, had it been at least 45 minutes shorter.  <br /> <br />The film's way too long 3 hour and 15 minute running time kills it, as does Jackson's attempt to humanize the ape. The original had me feeling for Kong, but this one had me disturbed at his relationship with Ann Darrow. Jackson made it seem like the woman was in love with the ape, with lots of romantic moments between them, and a totally unnecessary `love' scene amongst Christmas trees, snow, and an ice skating rink. (BARF!)The original Kong was brutal and no holds barred. This one is the standard Hollywood fare - cheesy, with two many acion sequences and scenes worthy of the cutting room floor. <br /> <br />Speaking of unnecessary scenes, I found a good 45 minute chunk that could have been edited out of this thing and would have made the film far superior. Lots of character development that doesn't add anything because it doesn't go anywhere, too many repetitive action sequences that drag on and one and on, and too many lovers moments between beauty and beast. <br /> <br />The original King Kong is what made Jackson want to become a filmmaker. You'd think he'd stay away from a Hollywoodized remake and try to stay true to the original. Perhaps he thinks he did, but he definitely didn't. I'm one fan of the original who felt this film could have been so much more.  <br /> <br />By the 2 hour mark, I was ready for the film to be over, but I knew Kong had yet to be taken from Skull Island to New York. By the end, when Beauty and Beast had their tender lovers moment for the seventh time too many, I was ready to walk out of the theatre. I wish I had. But no, instead I cursed and moaned and waited for the film's nevercoming end. <br /> <br />I also feel to need to point out what another reviewer, whose review probably got lost in this massive shuffle, said- <br /> <br />1)Naomi Watts is barefoot for the whole time on Skull Island. Yet her feet never hurt, nor get cut up or blistered, no broken toes or bruised soles after running wildly over rugged terrain and sharp rocks in a night gown. Hmm?  <br /> <br />2) Kong basically handles her like a rag doll for most of the time on the island, yet she suffers no whiplash, sore neck, dislocated joints, etc. <br /> <br />3)Though breathtaking, the scene on top of the Empire State building is so ridiculous. I've been up there in winter time, and there's no way Watts doesn't freeze to death in her little flapper girl dress and a pair of pumps. I mean my hand hurt just getting it out of my glove to grab a quick snapshot up there, it was like 18 degrees BEFORE the wind chill factor. Also, the wind gusts atop the tower are unbelieveable. Again, she'd get blown right off the side of the building in those little pumps. <br /> <br />This was quite distracting for me as well, and took away from the film. Watts' character should have died within her first five minutes on Skull Island after what she had been through. These moments just made me angry and took away from any enjoyment I could have gotten from the film. <br /> <br />I was never a fan of Peter Jackson; now, he's on my Worst Directors List. He seems to be nothing but a big show-off, as my friend so graciously pointed out after the film was over. We agreed that the film takes too long to get started, and too long to get to its end. I might be in the minority here, because the audience was clapping by the end of this. I, however, was thankful it was over. What a disappointment! <br />
B00080ZG10|4.0|Never have I seen such a stunning and extravagant use of color in a film...where it did not seem gaudy and overdone. This is a glamorous movie that has been elegantly shot and superbly cast.
B000BU0B6M|3.0|`The Brothers Grimm' directed by the important fantasy / satire director, Terry Gilliam of Monty Python fame is a disappointing movie on several counts.<br /><br />First and foremost is the promise of another Gilliam movie comparable to `The 12 Monkeys', `Brazil', or even `Time Bandits'. Gilliam has had his share of flops, but overall his reputation for quirkily entertaining movies is good enough to look forward to a new effort from the director of `Monty Python and the Holy Grail' and other Python movies. As it turns out, we discover in Gilliam's opening statements in his voice-over commentary, he didn't even like the script when it was first offered to him to direct.<br /><br />The second count is that Peter Jackson (`Lord of the Rings') and the Harry Potter directors have raised the bar on expectations from the quality of human and plot aspects of fantasy movies. You can't get away anymore with great special effects anymore. Jackson gets more `human interest' out of his principle ent character, Treebeard than Gilliam gets out of his whole cast, not to mention the great characterization he gets from a CGI character, Gollum.<br /><br />The third count is that the movie simply doesn't quite know what it wants to be. Is it a horror movie or a comedy or a drama? While `Time Bandits' is largely played for laughs and `Brazil' is clearly a tragedy with some funny scenes (especially Robert DeNiro's cameo appearance scene), I simply don't know what the authors are expecting from me in this movie.<br /><br />The fourth count is a lack of depth in the characterizations and story we have what I suspect is a really weak performance from Matt Damon and not much more from Heath Ledger. Some of this may be due to the way his shots were blocked and shot, but I do get the feeling that Damon in this movie is not the Matt Damon of `Good Will Hunting' or even the Bourne movies. Then again, maybe he was simply horribly miscast, as he did so well in those other three outings. Peter Stormare as the French torturer virtually steals the show from Damon and Ledger. Gilliam regular Jonathan Pryce does well in his small role, but is not enough to raise the overall level of human acting. The overriding impression I get from Gilliam's voice-over commentary is that he spends all his time talking about how locations were used and scenery and costumes were set up. Compare this to the commentary for a great movie of characters such as Renoir's `The Rules of the Game' and you can see how little humanity there is to be found in this movie.<br /><br />The fifth count is that Gilliam and the author have dreadfully misused their underlying text, the fairy tales of the 19th century folklorists whose names are given to the two lead characters in this movie. I can imagine a movie based on exactly the same material done in an entirely different way which would have been much warmer and made much better use of their audience's memories of the fairy tales.<br /><br />One of the easiest ways to appreciate how badly this movie fails would be to compare it to a movie based on a similar premise, `Ghostbusters' with similar reliance on special effects to move the story along. While both stories involve teams of con artists facing a real supernatural danger, with their feet being held to the fire by a strong government agency, `Ghostbusters' comes off as a triumph of both comedy and victory of good over evil while `The Brothers Grimm' simply plays out our expectations. One of the many symptoms of how one movie succeeds while the other fails is the fact that up to the last scene, `Ghostbusters' was pulling unexpected rabbits out of its hat while `Grimm' was just playing out its tired story. Just imagine what `The Brothers Grimm' would have been like with Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd in the lead roles!<br /><br />My biggest puzzle with this movie is why Gilliam decided to do it if he didn't like the script. I would have thought it would have had all the markings of an earlier failure on the Baron Munchausen movie. This movie will not even make anyone's top ten list of fantasy movies.<br /><br />Even with the Gilliam voice-over commentary, this DVD is not worth buying.an earlier failure on the Baron Munchausen movie.

6305807086|5.0|As a huge fan of anything by Charlie Kaufmann this movie lived up to my expectations and more. Seeing Cameron Diaz as a dowdy, frizzy haired character had me totally forget how glamorous she actually is. I have never thought much of her as an actress until now. John Cusack was fabulous and Catherine Keener was amazingly sexy. Is there anything a man wouldn't do for her when she smiles? There's twists and turns like you would expect from Kaufmann yet he always keeps you guessing. Highly reccomended!
0307276902|3.0|I watched this author on the Oprah show, and her staff said they couldn't put it down, they finished throughout the night...I found it hard to read this book straight through,its several hundred pages, tiny texted, author's style is descriptively long (ex. My stomach was churning and sick, churning, churning, churning.) <br /> <br />...if all that was true in the book, then it is a very vivid account. Very intersting. But I wondered how much he embellished any of it... <br /> <br />...I like the author's references to Tao Te Ching-which he got me into. I figured if this is the only approach that worked for this rebellious,little,wannabe hard-ass then it could work for me. <br /> <br />-the book was long but I got through it. What made it interesting were his fellow recovering housemates-some of them had me cracking up!
B000AMJDHY|3.0|This is a pretty good album... i would say P!atd is fall out boy meets hellogoodbye. The songs are really catchy and memorable, espicialy \\"camisado\\", \\"the only difference...\\" \\" lying is the most fun...\\" and \\"london beckoned..\\" <br /> <br />Some of the songs are really annoying though and they get on your nerves... i would say like 2 or 3 of the songs are really crappy.  Overall i would reccomend this cd to pop punk emo fans. <br /> <br />Doesnt anyone else find it lame when people compare bands like fall out boy and p!atd and say they arent as good as like nirvana and jimi hendrix....duh.. how is that a fair comparison at all. Anyone can hide behind music legends and be untouchable, but it takes some guts to be a fan of bands that the classic rock nerds will knock on for \\"not being as good as the beatles\\" or some crap like that....big surprise.
B00005JNX0|1.0|I strongly recommend NOT purchasing Madagascar. There are so many good CG and non CG animated movies out there with such better plots, storylines, characters, etc. Madagascar just stunk. And the reason it stunk is because Dreamworks was so interested in showing off their technical brilliance with so many unnecessary and unconnected asides and distractions from the plot that when the movie returned to the plot I was tired from trying to make sense of how the scenarios were related even to each other and not just the main storyline. Pick any Pixar movie and you'll find it more compelling than this Dreamworks movie. Don't get me wrong me and the family like some of the Dreamworks movies - Shrek, Shrek 2, Kung Fu Panda (which is TOTALLY AWESOME, we own and watch it often) and Aliens vs. Monsters. Like Dreamworks, Pixar also shows off their technical brilliance in all of their movies (esp. in HD - whoa!), but the difference is that one is not distracted from the storyline, plot, character development. Often this brilliance is an integral piece of character development, plot development, story movement, camera angle, etc, that enriches an already strong story. Madagascar did not deliver for us. The characters were just this side of one dimensional. If you don't care about the characters in a story (any story) it isn't a story worth telling. I, as well as my fourteen year old son (both of us looooove animation and are connesiurs) agreed the only redeeming quality of this movie were the penguins and enjoyed the second short movie involving their efforts to save their compadre when he gets into trouble at Xmas time, but don't buy it for that, either.
B0007TKNL0|1.0|Its very hard to begin a review without going off in a rant about all the things that are displeasing about this movie. As far as die hard phans are concerned one must be warned to keep an open mind. for people never before exposed to the wonders that are the Phantom of the Opera it could be considered a good starting point.  <br /> <br />There are many different versions of the Phantom's tale and the most popular is the Andrew Lloyd Webber version. This movie casting form the older more maniacal version of the Phantom was deliberately changed by ALW himself wanting a younger version that audiences could relate unfortunately his pick although pleasing to the eye did not do his own version as well. Instead of using the dark seductive voice we know Gerard Butler possesses it is suspect you spent hours listening to the original cast recording to adapt the poor rendition of the Michael Crawford portrayal he used. <br /> <br />I can not say there where come moment in the film where we did not see his natural voice prevail and give us a glimpse of what might have been. The scene in the underground lair where the mask is ripped from his face and he rants it truly wonderful. while others sung this part Gerard growled ranted and stormed about like a man possessed making him sound very much like he should. In a few moments usually his breaking down he drops in tones and whispers another glimpse of the path he should have taken. This is especially evident when he is singing The Point of No Return. A very moving piece and probably the only tolerable one in the movie Masquerade taking a close second.  <br /> <br />The cast of secondary characters made the movie enjoyable Minnie Driver leading the way. although she did not sing her own parts she filled the role to all of it qualifications as if she had been truly singing. I myself have always despised Raoul and many phans will agree with this view point for he is the bane of the Phantoms happiness. In this movie I absolutely adored him, the actor had stage presence and his voice was gentle and powerful, simple gesture on his part said more then many of the spoken lines other character failed to achieve the emotion behind them. Meg and Madame Girl were also lovely although Madame Girl seemed a tad stiff in her role perhaps a bit childish at times. <br /> <br />Overall the casting was lovely and worth watching until Christine's first aria. When Emmy Rossem first appeared on screen she defiantly had the right look and handled herself very well. The main problem was she kept the same look throughout the movie. She looked dazed and in a trance, glassy eyes a slightly parted mouth. It seemed the makeup artist tried to cover up the look by giving her a smoky eye look not suited for the girl face but only succeed in drawing more attention to to eyes. Her vocals leave a lot to be desired for as well, she has some experience participating in an opera chorus in her younger years. While one can tell the soundtrack was tweaked in production she has feature she can not hide a very bad squeak when she slides from note to not usually during a huge change from high to low and vice versa. <br /> <br />The music all seems a bit toned down the overture lacking the power behind the organs but the visual was quite stunning. The biggest disappointment aside from Christine was the Phantom's deformity. Commented and agreed upon my man phans as nothing more then a bad sunburn or burn from a fire, Mr. Kevin Spacey was more disfigured by his burns in Pay It Foreward. <br /> <br />Perhaps it was censored as not to frighten small children a sad fact to please the masses. My recommendation for this film is perhaps rent it or wait for it to televised. If you do find yourself watching this film try watching it in French for the story of the Phantom originated in France and the French dubbing is lovely Christine actually sounds as she should.

B000002Q88|3.0|This record could have been really big. When you have former Pink Floyd The Wall co-producer, Bob Ezrin, involved in a project that starts off with a very powerful song as \\"ghosts\\" you have to think that what's coming next is rock and roll history in the making. Unfortunately it's not the case. One have to think that \\"Spirit\\" was meant as a concept album, but strangely enough it contains up to 3 songs that were not written by any Kansas member or Ezrin, and what follows after \\"Ghosts\\" is a collection of forgettable songs, some catchy I admit, some not even catchy, that drift away from the mood that the first songs gets you in.<br /><br />I bought this album in vinyl when it first came out, and I was very disappointed with it except for 4 themes : \\"ghosts\\", the rocker \\"The Preacher\\", the very powerfull \\"Rainmaker\\" , and the very short instrumental \\"T.O. Witcher\\" ,and I just bought the CD thinking of how much I liked them and also because after all this time it seemed fair to me to give the whole album another try, well , I can assure anyone that this album is not under rated, and it is not a hidden gem or anything in that regard...it could have been, it started off to be...but it fell very far away from greatness.<br /><br />And again, after 16 years, I still can't  recommend it to anyone for anything but those 4 tunes, but I can honestly say they are very much worth it.
0380807343|5.0|This book is amazing. Neil Gaiman has such a wonderful imagination (you wonder how he comes up with these ideas), and I've always admired his work, but out of all his novels, I love Coraline best.  <br /> <br />This is a \\"children's book,\\" but I can't imagine anyone not enjoying it or at least appreciating its creativity, unless they simply had poor taste. Actually, I could imagine young children not particularly liking it; Coraline isn't scary, but it is eerie, especially when the world of the other mother is breaking down (the other father stumbling around in the cellar and Misses Spink and Forcible stuck together in that cocoon were probably the creepiest parts).  <br /> <br />Coraline does not leave you with a gloomy feeling, however; maybe that has something to do with it being suitable for children, but I've read plenty of children's books that were depressing (The Chronicles of Narnia, for example). I loved the world on the other side of the wooden door as well as Coraline's little insights (ex. \\"They weren't making much sense; she decided they were having an argument as old and comfortable as an armchair, the kind of argument that no one really wins or loses but which can go on forever, if both parties are willing\\"). The fact that all the adults ignored her and didn't really appreciate her for the clever, unique girl she was probably had something to do with her discovering the world on the other side of the door in the first place (I'm sure the door doesn't just open for anyone); she wanted to find it.  <br /> <br />The other mother and all the people in the other world understand her and appreciate her, and the other mother created them all basically to entertain her, and that's part of what appeals to Coraline about the other world. In fact, the other mother loves her, in her own strange, inhuman way, which she expresses (\\"'Thank you, Coraline,' said the other mother coldly, and her voice did not just come from her mouth. It came from the mist, and the fog, and the house, and the sky. She said, 'You that I love you.' And, despite herself, Coraline nodded. It was true: the other mother loved her\\"). And the other crazy old man upstairs tells her, \\"Nothing's changed, little girl... And what if you do everything you swore you would? What then? Nothing's changed. You'll go home. You'll be bored. You'll be ignored. No one will listen to you, really listen to you. You're too clever and too quiet for them to understand. They don't even get your name right. Stay here with us... We will listen to you and play with you and laugh with you. Your other mother will build whole worlds for you to explore; and tear them down every night when you are done.\\"  <br /> <br />But Coraline doesn't want to have everything she wants, and the people in the other world could never understand that. She wants her boring old life, and the boring old flat, and the parents who are preoccupied with staring at computer screens all day but love her in a way the other mother never could. If there's a \\"lesson\\" in the story, it's that; appreciate the life you have.  <br /> <br />Her normal life is so staid and quiet compared to life on the other side of the door, but it's only because she's there that it's so exciting; like she perceived, the other parents aren't really in their bedroom except at the moment she enters, and the other people who live in the house only serve to amuse her. I'm not particularly sure why the other mother wants her; perhaps she's just a covetous creature that collects strange little children for diversion. Perhaps she gets lonely sometimes. She goes to great lengths to win over the children who stumble or are lured into her world, and then she plays with them awhile, tires of them soon, and tosses them into the closet like the remnants of old rag dolls that have ceased to amuse her.  <br /> <br />One of the most endearing parts was when Coraline was telling the cat about her father saving her from the swarm of wasps when she wasvery young (\\"'And he said that wasn't brave of him, doing that, just standing there and being stung... It wasn't brave because he wasn't scared: it was the only thing he could do. But going back again to get his glasses when he knew the wasps were there, when he was really scared. That was brave'\\"). She truly loves her parents, and she's brave enough that she goes back into the other world and plays a risky game with the other mother to get them back. Reading it, you feel like throwing yourself into the arms of your parents like a little child again, the parents you don't love as wholly or simply as you used to now that you've started to judge them as people.  <br /> <br />When I was little, I lived in a big old house, too, with three stories, each of which was inhabited by a different family (we lived on the first one, and we didn't call them flats because we're not British). And at the end of our kitchen was a door, and on the other side of it was just a brick wall. The door used to connect to another part of the house, my mom told me, when it was all one house and not separately rented sections. On the other side of the brick wall lived an old man who played opera music too loudly at night (it floated, ghostly, down the vent in my room sometimes), and whom we hardly ever saw and I might never have known existed. I liked to think that it was another world living, breathing on the other side, though, waiting for me to find it and give it a purpose for existing. But I never did, obviously. And I wasn't any Coraline, either. I just made up my own worlds in which to play, some of which are intact to this day.  <br /> <br />So here's to Coraline, the most interesting little girl I've never met, to the other world, the spookiest world that wasn't one of my dreams, and to Neil Gaiman, one of the best authors I've ever had the pleasure of discovering. Last of all, to the sense of wonder and imagination, the feeling you get when you're creating new worlds, that never really leaves you as a child or adult.
0679422714|5.0|This is an outstanding book. To criticize it as \\"a hatchet job\\" because \\"The book's Mau is not nuanced; too one-dimensionally evil\\" is truly being in denial. He was a very self-centered, un-caring, using, manipulative, deeply bad man. Simply that. Let us fervently hope that humanity never comes under the power of such a man again!! <br /> <br />Many western intellectuals placed so much hope in and identified so deeply with Communism that, although they have no problem seeing Hitler he was, they resist seeing their former idols Stalin and Mao as they truly were. They just can't accept that Mao wasn't trying to help the suffering peasants when in fact Mau was using them for his own aggrandizement. Many, here and in China,  have bought too deeply into Mao's PR image - they can't let it go.  <br /> <br />Don't look at what Mao said, look at what he did and how he did it. The \\"Mao approach\\" can be seen consistantly from the 1920's : produce horrific violence, humiliate, crush, destroy. The beneficiaries were not the Chinese people - he did it to benefit himself and his \\"greatness\\". <br /> <br />This is an outstanding book. The comment from the librarian: \\"A person who suffered under a dictator should not write his biography.\\" How naive; how ridiculous; how stupid. Who better to write his biography than someone who really saw the effects of Mao? Should the writings of Jews who suffered under Hitler also be similarly condemned? <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|As of three days ago, I had only heard of Firefly. I had seen a small clip of its sequelish movie, Serenity. I was up all night watching the series, and only took the briefest of naps before I continued onto Serenity. I'm only sorry to have taken so long to put in the first disk.  <br /> <br />This show is phenomenal. The casting is superb, as is the world that has been created, a unique  one, with a dash of Chinese culture that makes it all the more believable. The story doesn't focus around how amazing a fighter this person is, how they see a can see lie the moment it comes out of a mouth... no... It focuses on the entire crew, and how they fit together. How they mesh, mold, and clash. <br /> <br />This series has much potential to go on, and forward. I've seen Buffy and Angel, and thought them fair shows. The plot is still there, waiting, with threads of the story still hanging lose, snarling. <br /> <br /> This is fantastical in every sense of the word. I half expect to wake up any moment now from this dream.  <br /> <br />-A Browncoat (fan) in days
B00005JOIF|5.0|\\"Munich,\\" Steven Spielberg's depiction of the 1972 Olympic massacre and its aftermath, is as perfect as a movie gets. Intelligent, realistic, engaging, well-acted, well-directed and well-written (by Eric Roth and \\"Angels in America\\" playwright Tony Kushner), it has \\"Oscar\\" written all over it.<br /><br />The movie centers on the work of a secret Mossad assassination squad, tasked with killing the architects of the massacre of Israeli athletes at the '72 Olympic Games. The team is a varied lot - young and old, hot and cold-blooded, who share the common task of saving Israel by striking back at its enemies. Along the way, the team must negotiate with others' whose identities and loyalties are questionable at best. Can even the Mossad be trusted to give the team accurate information? Can information merchants Louis and his \\"Papa,\\" who supply the team with leads, be trusted? Or are they playing the team against it other \\"clients\\" - playing both ends against the middle?<br /><br />\\"Munich\\" is realistically and appropriately gory, if that makes any sense. Explosives blow people to pieces. Guns of various caliber do their killing work in a variety of believable ways. Gunfights are messy, loud and confusing. And unlike some of Spielberg's other work, the special effects don't get in the way of the story. Thankfully!<br /><br />\\"Munich\\" also delves into the personal lives and motivations of the team. Defending one's country takes a psychic toll, which is presented here with pathos. Team leader Avram (sensitively played by Eric Bana), himself the son of a soul-wounded hero, wrestles not only with life and death decisions, but about their morality. When is it right to kill? Is vengeance a good enough motive? What if morally-defensible killing achieves no worthwhile end? And what if one's enemies have good reasons of their own for fighting? The scene in which Avram confronts a PLO commando underlines the moral complexity of fighting a war in which both sides have legitimate grievances and both want the same end: peace for their children. These questions are a sub-current to the action that gives it extra depth.<br /><br />Along with millions of others, I watched the 1972 Munich massacre unfold on ABC television, between footraces, javelin throws and pole vaulting. Archival footage is combined with movie footage, helping the viewer understand what transpired both before the cameras and out of sight. Some of the old familiar faces and voices- Jim Mackay and Peter Jennings-give the film historical resonance for those old enough to have watched it first hand. Probably because of a lack of film footage, the outcome and aftermath of the massacre have never received the attention that the hostage story did. While this film doesn't dwell on the death of the Israeli athletes in great detail, the story it does tell provides another compelling cinematic layer.<br /><br />\\"Munich\\" is an incredible film, and it deserves every award it will receive.ate grievances and both want the same end: peace for their children.

0060899190|5.0|My boyfriend frequents the PostSecret blog on a semi-weekly basis. I didn't really get it until I held the book in my hands. I guess I just needed a larger dose of the secrets for the significance of the project to sink in. This is an absolutely beautiful book. Very moving.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|It is a general rule of ours that if nothing happens in the first thirty minutes of a movie, nothing is going to happen.  Having read several reviews of this one, and having a long-time liking for Bill Murray, I forced myself to watch it through to the bitter end.  It was no exception to the thirty minute rule. <br /> <br />I can certainly relate to being stuck in a strange city with nothing to do, but the concept really runs dry pretty quickly.  There are a couple of redeeming points about the film - it's interesting as a travelogue, the portraits of vapid people are fairly good - but all in all, it's just plain dull, dull, dull.
0312263120|3.0|This book would have been much better had Dan Brown omitted about 50 pages. The plot drags on and on, with the slow-moving storyline never going anywhere. Read other Dan Brown novels, don't waste your time or money here.
B00003CXAW|5.0|The documentary extras on the making of the 1933 classic would alone be worth the cost of this set (as would Peter Jackson's loving re-creation of the lost \\"spder pit\\" sequence). The restoration of the film itself is first-rate, with astonishing clarity, albeit a bit grainy. If you love classic fantasy, you should not hesiate to purchase this near-Criterion-quality set.
B000BP86OG|5.0|Now, I know that many reviews here are saying that the album isn't \\"rock\\" enough, but I'm here to say that I don't agree at all. <br /> <br />The Darkness's first album -Permission to Land- was very, very good. It has it's flaws, but considering that it came out in a day in age where rock has been generally degraded to a shell of its former glory, it was excellent. <br /> <br />Now, in 2005, we have their follow up album, and man, is it a ride.  <br />The title track, One Way Ticket, comes in with a very earthy and dark intro with a pipe, and goes into a song that is more or less a slightly more evolved song than the ones on PtL. As the album moves on, it becomes clear that the album is different, and in an incredibly good way. Instead of having AC/DC like songs, as in the first album, it has songs very reminicant of Queen and ELO, with the likes of Pink Floyd, Van Halen, Led Zeppelin, and Def Leppard thrown in. The result of this is a sound that causes the band and the album to almost seem like it was sent from a time machine somewhere in the range of '75 to '85.  <br /> <br />In all conclusiveness, this is NOT like modern rock at all, and I thank God that it isn't. So if you like \\"classic rock\\", any of the bands I mentioned, or have any decency, you should pick this album up.
071484232X|5.0|The hardback edition of this book is a gorgeous thing to have. Fact and works are all there beautifully arranged. Whether you love or not Waterhouse's works this is a must have book to any book shelf.<br /><br />I was inclined to buy it following the path of excellent reviews at Amazon.com and I am not disappointed.<br /><br />I love boks on painting that give a good balance between the artists' lives and their works, which is something not so common as you would think it should be.<br /><br />Have it.
B000005IU2|2.0|And this is coming from someone who loves the other two official Stooges albums. The debut was a lot of fun and \\"Raw Power\\" was brilliant, but \\"Fun House\\"--to me--missed the mark. It's musically consistent and all that(much more so than the first album), but there isn't any one song that stands out as an anthem of howling desperation. '1970' is close but no cigar, and 'Loose' is a decent track; I could do without the rest of the album. 'TV Eye' has a great riff, as far as riffs go, but I prefer big, fat, ringing chords to riffs. 'Dirt' and the title song are sludgy, yawn-inducing dirges.  Most Stooges fans consider \\"Fun House\\" to be the band's tour-de-force, I know, and who am I to argue with them? It's just that, to me, the Stooges were all about(as I said before) desperation...and this album has more swagger than desperation. It's kind of like the difference between two of the Stones' all-time classics, 'Street Fighting Man' and 'Honky Tonk Women'. Which one has more staying power? Swagger is transitory, fleeting...but there is something of the eternal in desperation(witness the frightening wails and throbbing musical strains of 'I Wanna Be Your Dog' or 'Penetration').
B000BKVQTS|2.0|Terry Gilliam is one of my  favorite directors, or at least he has directed some of my favorite films.I had forgotten that he directed this terrible film when I watched it this afternoon ,in fact I commented to my friend that this would be a good movie if Terry Gilliam had directed it.When the credits finally rolled I almost cried to see his name there.This is a very bad film.It didnt have to be.It could have been great.But  very poor casting, uninspired performances, over use of so so(at best) CGI, a terrible script and the most uninspired and weak direction by a previously artful often edgy and always strong director's career, results in this being a very weak film and it grieves me to feel this way.I can never again trust that a film is good,or even watchable just because it is a Terry Gilliam motion picture.
B000AMJDHY|2.0|As far as originality goes, this album is 1 star. I decided to listen to these guys when i came home from college because my little sister loved them.  Honestly, i cannot understand why, i guess its because the album was written and produced with all the shiny cheesy hooks and lyrics it takes to make it to the radio these days.  If you like this genere of music, try Head Automatica.  After hearing them, patd will sound like the pure crap it is.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I love Science fiction,but for the most part only in book form...and only if it has a good sense of humor.I believe i can count on one hand the Sci-Fi movies I like let alone love.. btw Star Wars is only marginally on the like list.I am not a Joss Whedon fan in particular I can easily recognize his considerable talent in Buffy and Angel,but these failed to engage me enough to consider myself a fan.Then came Firefly ,I loved it and looked forward to Friday nights while it was on TV..It was special ..it was far better than anything I had ever seen on TV before or since...and then came the series on DVD and I found out I was far from the only person who loved this show.Serenity didn't disappoint, it is a great film.It is succeeds completely in every way it attempts to work.    The rules are turned upside down from the convention we are programed to expect in our Sci Fi... A spaceship without weapons or faster than light travel..worlds without alien lifeforms, dialog without continuous cussing that still manages to be adult and smart the way very few films are, good guys who do bad things and bad guys who do good things often depending on the perspective of the characters surrounding them our hero's believe things , to the point of being willing to die for them that most others in their world believe the exact opposite or just don't bother to care much about at all. Great FX and CGI but only to support terrific performances and dialog not to make the viewer say wow.. the viewers do often say wow but because of the script and real ideas not because of eye candy CGI...and a space battle focusing not on reaping mass destruction and racking up casualties but primarily avoiding being destroyed themselves whilst fighting toward the goal of simply getting out the truth so people may draw their own conclusions but from an honest and educated bearing.     This is great story telling.This is great film making.This is a great film,and its also great fun to watch by the way...Youshould buy it,and while your at it you should go ahead and buy the Firefly series at the same time..You will want it after seeing Serenity and both are very re-watchable, Hell Ive had Firefly since the day it became available on DVD and I still am prone to pop a disk in and watch and enjoy it...even still notice new things in the episodes with almost every viewing.
0684824906|5.0|This is the best book on Lincoln I have read... highly recommended!
0312995423|1.0|I enjoyed Angels & Demons, and I am a computer person & interested in Crypto, so I thought i'd give this a try. <br />The plot is laughable -- big enough holes to drive a truck through.  For people who are supposedly so bright, I wanted to slap the heck out of the main characters for their stupidity. <br />The \\"science\\" is completely made up, and a lot of things just simply do not make any sense.  I know Dan Brown is not a scientist, and he was writing a popular novel, but it would have made the book MUCH better if he had bothered to do any kind of research beyond simply a high-level skim and then make it up as he went along. <br />I got 7/8ths of the way through this, and then gave up.  I just could not make myself continue with it, and I really didn't care enough about the characters to see what happened to them.
B000B0WODA|1.0|I first listened to Franz Ferdinand looking for another band to add  to my music collection and found wonderful bass lines and funky guitar with a unique style that was actually worth listening to.  The first album was perfect other than the band's decision on what to release as a single, Take Me Out, which was not one of the best tracks on the self-titled album.   <br />   After enjoying the first album, out comes \\"You Could Have It So Much Better\\" which proves what is wrong with music these days.  Consumers get so wrapped up in the \\"right\\" music that it sells but there is no artistic merit in either deed. Franz Ferdinand's second album is all noise with no music at all.  The lyrics have no effect because the effects of guitar amps take over and leave the listener disappointed in a once great band.   <br />  Just as Newsweek called The Hives and Strokes stylized flops, Franz Ferdinand can now be added to that category and be put on the garbage heap of pop-rock history.
B0006A9FMI|1.0|Being a huge fan of the first GITS film, I decided to rent this film on DVD one day. While the film is brilliant, the region 1 DVD from Dreamworks is horrible. The DVD doesn't feature an english dub, AND the subtitles are awful. They're  hearing-impared, which means that when you view certain scenes, it says '[helicopter approching], or '[telephone ringing].' The HoH subtitles are the visual equivalent of watching the movie with someone who won't shut up. \\"Oooo, here comes a helicopter!\\" \\"Did you hear that explosion?\\". I will admit though that the DVD does have a great audio/video transfer of the film.<br /><br />Luckily, since I've seen this, Dreamworks corrected the HoH subtitles. This can be told apart by the V4 mark on the DVD case's spine.<br /><br />If you want a dubbed version of GITS2, check out this petition:<br />[...]
B000002OX5|5.0|for some reason this album is overlooked. perhaps it's because it doesn't have a grabber like \\"my generation\\" or \\"won't get fooled again\\". \\"i can see for miles\\", the only recognizable song on the album even to who fans, doesn't quite cut it. <br /> <br />yet \\"sell out\\" is a stone cold masterpiece, both in design and execution. it's a giddy concoction of radio announcements, parody commercials, and glorious ringing pop tunes that glide, tell stories, and go bish-bash. my 9 and 11 year old request it every time we're in the car, and the result is an exultant sing along. <br /> <br />besides the hit, and despite the fact that you've never heard of them, \\"mary anne\\", \\"odorono\\", \\"tattoo\\", \\"our love was\\", \\"i can't reach you\\", and \\"relax\\" are all top shelf who songs. although set as song commercials, \\"heinz baked beans\\" and \\"medac\\", will put a silly grin on your face. <br /> <br />as a double bonus, this is about the only cd where you won't hit the reject button as soon as the extra tracks come on. \\"glittering girl\\",  \\"melancholia\\", \\"early morning cold taxi\\", \\"someone's coming\\", the jaguar commercial, \\"girl's eyes\\", and \\"glow girl\\" are terrific, and could've been put on the released album without any loss of quality. i don't know how they decided which songs made the cut. <br /> <br />buy it and find out that one of your favorite bands wrote about ten great songs and one great concept album more than you thought they did. for me, it blows tommy (too unbelievable), and quadrophenia (too incomprehensible) right out of the water.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Face it people, \\"Sounding the Seventh Trumpet\\" and \\"Waking the Fallen\\" are two horrible hardcore crap albums compared to \\"City Of Evil.\\" Aside from a few good songs off their last two albums Avenged Sevenfold have never sounded as good. The fact that M.Shadows actually sings throughout the whole album is definitely a plus, for the fact that EVERYONE is doing the screaming, and everyone is doing the no solo thing and EVERYONE is just sucking. \\"City Of Evil\\" brings rock back, catchy vocal melodies with a lot of emotion behind the lyrics, guitar solos that are just plain nuts, the drumming is outstanding, the whole structure of the songs have completely gone in the RIGHT direction on this album. For those who think A7X sold out for being on TRL you are just plain jealous, this is a hard working band that have been around for a while now, and they totally deserve being on TV everyday and kicking Pop music in the ass. TRL needed A7X. Bottom line, I got this album a while ago, didn't give it a chance cause their last two albums were nothing special, then I actually sat down gave it a close listen and realized how amazing it is. I've been listening to it ever since. Buy this album, you will NOT regret it, unless you want to hear the same crap over and over be my guest.
B00004RF9B|5.0|I could go on about the sterling qualities of this film:  <br />an intelligent plot, great acting by the lead characters (even <br />Leslie Nielsen in his pre-buffoon prime), Anne Francis in all her <br />stunning youthful radiance. But that would be simply restating <br />what other reviews have said. What about George Lucas fessing up <br />to all the ideas and plot devices he conveniently \\"borrowed\\" <br />from this movie and incorporated whole-cloth into his \\"Star Wars\\" <br />series?  <br />Like when the spaceship drops out of \\"hyperdrive\\" at the film's <br />beginning. Or when Morbius describes his fellow colonists as <br />having been killed by some unknown planetary \\"Force\\". Or when <br />Robbie the Robot introduces itself as being fluent in several <br />hundred \\"languages, dialects and sub-tongues\\"--a verbatim quote <br />of C3P0 when he first meets Luke Skywalker in the original 1977 <br />\\"Star Wars\\". Don't believe me? Check out the movies and decide <br />for yourself. <br />Sure the special effects, by current standards, seem rather <br />antiquated. But don't forget, this was circa 1955 technology, <br />and when I saw the movie as an 8-year old kid, I was truly <br />mesmerized, as were most of the audience. It's even more <br />remarkable when you consider it took all of 22 years & George <br />Lucas' IL&M computers to produce anything better in the realm  <br />of SPFX. \\"Forbidden Planet\\" may not be the best sci-fi film <br />ever, but it certainly places in everyone's top ten. Five stars <br />and two thumbs up! <br /> <br />
B000BP86OG|5.0|The Darkness's second album, titled(as you should already know; but whatever, a formality is a formality) One Way Ticket to Hell and Back, is just stunning. In a period of music where there's no musical innovation, and conformity runs rampant, a breath of fresh air has been needed. This is that breath of fresh air. <br /> <br />The album opener, One Way Ticket, does everything an album opener should. It completely sets the dark tone for the album, and is still a fantastic piece in its own. Fredy Gomez's guest appearance on pan flutes is fabulous, for the dramatic opening. It sets the tone stunningly, and the ELO-reminiscent choir is fabulous. When it gets into the actual song, my one slight criticism is that it feels like it doesn't go too far. As for the rest of the songs themselves, well... You'll really have to see. When you hear the song 'Bald', you'll understand that it's not exactly easy to explain. <br /> <br />As for instrumentation, I think it's fabulous. From filtered guitars, orchestration, fabulous synths, Queen-esque multilayered vocals, and a fabulous drumkit, you'll find no problems here. <br /> <br />One criticism is that the band changes the feel from the AC/DC guitar driven rock to something more original, but I think it really, really works. If you want a completely direct comparison of the two styles, listen to the first part of One Way Ticket. Then, wait until 3:06 into the song. They use the effects wonderfully; I really don't think it's grounds for complaint. <br /> <br />I could go on and on, but I'll leave it at that. I really, really recommend this to anyone who liked the first album, and isn't afraid of something different.
0307276902|5.0|This book was so wonderful, so full of ups and downs, so filled with emotion. I think everyone should read it.
B00005JNX0|3.0|We have a young daughter, so it was only natural that someone in the extended family bought her \\"Madagascar\\" for Christmas.  It was a thoughtful gift, since my daughter loves animals, and we go to the Portland zoo often, where she falls in love with all the animals all over again.    My daughter would probably give \\"Madagascar\\" five stars . . . but then, she's 2.      \\"Madagascar\\" isn't a bad movie per se.  It's just that it is as unsatisfying as one of those summer blockbusters that you go to thinking you're going to see another \\"T2,\\" or \\"Die Hard,\\" and you suddenly realize you're watching \\"The Phantom.\\"  Just disappointing.    On paper, \\"Madagascar\\" should be great.  The vocal talents are full of recognized names -- Chris Rock as a freedom-loving zebra, Ben Stiller as a lion with a need to be loved and a submerged carnivore streak (he only belatedly realizes where steak comes from), David Schwimmer as a wimpy giraffe, and Jada Pinkett Smith as a voluptuous hippo make for an interesting headline.    But these folks, as talented as they are, fall flat. You can almost see Ben Stiller reading his lines in the studio, and Chris Rock, bless him, is poorly suited for this saccharine role.  (If anyone ever makes a rated 'R' Pixar-type movie with harsh language and biting satire, Rock should be the first actor signed, but here he's more hand-cuffed than when he hosted the Oscars.)    Without giving too much away, the plot of \\"Madagascar\\" is fairly simple.  Several animals in the Central Park Zoo in relative tranquility, and Alex the Lion particularly loves being the centerpiece of the entire production.  But Marty the Zebra has turned 10, so he's in the middle of a mid-life crisis -- the zoo is great, but is that all there is (and is this really a plot kids can relate to?).  Marty tries to escape to \\"the Wild,\\" of Connecticut, but this escapade and his friends' botched attempt to save Marty deposits the friends on the \\"wild\\" island of Madagascar.  Of course, when they getto Madagascar, the animals learn that life without room service is much more challenging than they thought.  (This difficulty is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the zebra, apparently, is capable of building colossal shelters out of bamboo and fronds, complete with sunlights.)    There's also the subplot about the carnivores and the herbivores learning about the whole \\"circle of life\\" the hard way.  It's hard for lifelong friends to hang out when they learn that one of them is supposed to, you know, eat the other one.    The City Animals also run into a bunch of lemur-like creatures, who are led by a most-annoying king Julien who has a most-annoying tendency to speak in malapropisms and to sing hip-hop doggerel.  (While my two-year old daughter loved \\"I Like to Move it Move It,\\" all the adults in earshot found this song considerably annoying after its first appearance.)    \\"Madagascar\\" should make us sit back and reflect on just how majestic both Shrek and the Pixar family of films (\\"Incredibles,\\" \\"Finding Nemo,\\" \\"Toy Story,\\" \\"A Bug's Life,\\" etc.) are.  These movies transcend their genre of computer-generated cartoons and qualify as great movies in their own right.  These stories are inspired by a great deal of wit as well as respect for the story-telling process. \\"Madagascar\\" is a purely routine movie with a big-name cast spinning out a less-than-inspired storyline.      The DVD for \\"Madagascar\\" is much better than the movie if, for nothing else, the Christmas special featuring the movie's beloved squad of penguins.  I didn't mention the penguins earlier, because they deserve separate treatment.  If the entire movie had been about these commando birds, \\"Madagascar\\" would have surely been a five-star effort.      All in all, \\"Madagascar\\" is fine if you've got younger kids, but check this one out only after you've exhausted the Shrek movies and the entire Pixar library.
B0002S94OS|3.0|I've have been having mixed feelings about this ablum. When I got this CD about a year and a half ago; I loved it. Then after a week it got a little old and I set it aside. So, for most of the year I repeated pretty much the same cycle over and over again,.....!!! Don't get me wrong the CD has some good stuff on it the gem of the ablum being the Ozzfest super hit \\"Laid to Rest\\"; which was the orginal reason I bought the ablum.  <br /> <br /> I really don't see what is so special about this band; there is nothing that makes this band stand out from all the others. Look I've listened to and compared Lamb of God to many bands, and I am came to the conclusion that this band is extremely overated. Yeah, Lamb of God put some pretty good tunes out like \\"Ruin\\", \\"11th Hour\\", and \\"Laid to Rest\\".... but the rest of their music is boring and bland. Lamb of God focuses to much on being hardcore and doesn't really focus on innovation. They pretty much copy Slayers guitar riffs, while basically trying to make themselves sound like a hybrid between Hatebreed and In Flames. <br /> <br /> The album isn't bad,.... but not great. Before I get into the album their were a few comments that ticked me off. There were two \\"know-it-alls\\" below me that called this metalcore. I ask ..... where the heck did you come up with that delusion. This is hardcore power metal bordering death metal!!! People do your homework,.... also Trivium can't even be compared to Lamb of God; Trivium = metalcore, hey both great bands but both from different generes impossible to compare.  <br /> <br /> My first complaint about the ablum is that it lacked in..... in craftsmanship. What I mean by this the band plainly didn't play to their full potential in this installment. I don't see any big guitar solos or drumming solos,.... well there are the guitar solos on track 10 \\"Ashes of the Wake\\" done by Testmeant, but besides that all the guitar playing consists of riffs, which all resmeble stuff done by Slayer. The guitar playing is great but really lets compare Matt Bachard from Shadows Fall(one of my favorite bands), Eddie Van Halen, Dimebag Darrel, and old school Zakk Wylde to Mark Morton and Willie Alder..... you get the point. Hey the guitar playing was great for \\"Laid to Rest\\" and the begging of \\"Hourglass\\"!!! The drumming was excellent Chris Alder has alot of talent.... no complaints would of loved a drumming solo.  <br /> <br /> I am not a big fan of the vocalist,... Randy Blythe. The band has plent of talent and could be about 10 times better. It just constantly growling and screaming. He sounds like the \\"Cookie Monster\\" on crack at times.  <br /> <br /> Yes his voice has improved from previous releases and you can understand him... but really!!! Take a listen to metal bands like \\"Shadows Fall\\", \\"Metallica\\", \\"Iron Maiden\\", \\"Pantera\\", \\"Megadeth\\", and \\"At The Gates\\".... they are as heavy as heck, and have there own unique sound that makes them stand out. Randy Blthe just sounds like mainstream death metal,.... hey want good death metal listen to \\"In Flames\\" and \\"Children of Bodom\\"!!! <br /> <br /> Hey, I'll give Randy credit he can pull off some amazing riffs and his aggresive voice will have you fist in the air wanting to start a riot. Yet, most of the time it's boring and repetive,.... plainly. Only hardcore death metal fans could appreciate this ablum fully. Hey, I like death metal as much as the next metalhead but really Lamb of God should try something different with the vocals,.....!!!  <br /> <br /> There are some good songs, that could have been great..... most of the album could be considered average. Nothing innovative, nothing special,.... just an overated band, with a average ablum. If you happen to like to Lamb of God take a listen to the band Shadows Fall which is an example of what power metal is supposed to be like!!! Hey if you don't like what I have to say fine.... suit yourself....I've heard better!!! <br /> <br />Ablum: <br /> <br />\\"Laid To Rest\\"- 9.5/10 Highlight of the CD,.... a excellent song that is what I would of liked the whole ablum to be like. An very agressive fist pumping song that has an extremly catch chours. Some nice guitar riffs, machine gun drumming,.... and some great vocal work from Randy Blythe.  <br /> <br />\\"Hourglass\\"- 7/10 Some of the best guitar action on the entire ablum at the beggining,.... the change in tempo causes the song to fall apart towards the end. Great begging choppy end sadly. Randy Blythe ruined the song plainly with the vocals at the end of the song. Major dissapointment to what could've been a masterpiece. <br /> <br />\\"Something To Die For\\"- 7.5/10 Pretty good song,.... didn't like it at first but the chours grew on me,.... the vocals could have been better, but an overall good performance from the band. <br /> <br />\\"Faded Line\\"- 8/10 Another solid song,....with lots of tempo changes that make this song a work of art in a way, showing different sides of the band.... yet I've heard better. Pretty good song.  <br /> <br />\\"Omerta\\"- 5/10 This song was a mess, and plainly a filler track. It was plainly too slow and the song plainly never went anywhere the band didn't do a good job with the instruments. What the hell was Rand Blythe doing at the begging of a song with some kind of stupid speech. This song blows....!!! <br /> <br />\\"Blood On The Scribe\\"- 8/10 Great, song in general.... one of the stronger tracks and some great work by the band. Randy Blthe did pretty good vocal wise as well. Some great vocal and guitar riffs, along with some great drumming.  <br /> <br />\\"One Gun\\"- 7/10 Average song,.... nothing special. <br /> <br />\\"Break You\\"- 6/10 Sounds the same as \\"One Gun\\" at times but the tempos speed slows down at the chours which in a way brought the song down,.... still somewhat enjoyable. <br /> <br />\\"What I've Become\\"- 6.5/10 Starts off great, with some nice guitar playing,.... but it plainly falls apart,... and once again sounds almost identical to the two songsabove the ablum. <br /> <br />\\"Ashes of the Wake\\"- 9/10 Great Instrumental song featuring the two guitar players from the band Testment,....which was pretty cool.... heard better but hey I'll settle. <br /> <br />\\"Remorse Is For The Dead\\"- 8.5/10 Starts off slow,.... kinda like one of those classic Metallica songs and all of a sudden suprises you, and it turns into quite an catchy and heavy song that I personally loved.  <br /> <br /> Overall the ablum was pretty good,.... not all the songs were great. The ablum had a good start but during the middle it fell apart, all because of bad song writing somewhat repetive vocals, and plainly lack of imagination. Lamb of God is just another band, and \\"Ashes of the Wake\\" shows maturity, but growing pains have seemed to have wounded Lamb of God.  <br /> <br /> The ablum recieves a 7/10 or by the Amazon.com rating scale a 3/5. <br />
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Just like 101 Dalmations, Pinocchio etc etc. <br /> <br />Well done Disney!

0736063684|4.0|Wow, what a great book!. The illustrations are fantastic. I like the layout and the \\"straight to the point\\" structure of the text. However, the book mentions throughout the exercises that one should inhale while lifting the weight (or through the exertion phase of a lift). I've been exercising for most of my life and have been a personal trainer for two years. It makes more sense to exhale throughout the exertion phase. This mainly holds true as weight becomes heavier. Blood pressure increases when exertion happens and exhaling works like a release valve, thus lowering and regulating blood pressure. Instinctively, people, mainly beginners, tend to hold their breath when lifting a heavy weight and they get all red faced. I tried holding my breath while doing reps through one workout(big fan of Myth Busters on cable, by the way)and all I got out of that was a big headache. I still highly recommend this book to everyone.
B00007LTIL|5.0|I purchased this album recently, and was amazed that most of my favorite Dead songs are on it.  \\"Box of Rain\\" seems to be everyone's favorite, but honestly \\"Ripple\\" does it the most for me.  A great album to preview what their sound is like and proof that they can get it done in the studio.  Buy it with Workingman's Dead.  Simply beautiful.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I am in the camp of placing this album in the stunning category.  I see it as being refreshingly original and I agree with another reviewer who describes Funeral as a breakthrough.  There are layers here that are subtly, but perfectly, hypnotic.  I place this album in a \\"work of art\\" category.  Its not just just another rock album.

B0007P3582|3.0|On his sophomore joint, 50 conforms to the popular adage: \\"if it isn't broken, don't fix it.\\" So it's not surprising that some tracks are reminiscent of his past work - \\"I'm Not Supposed To Die Tonight\\" and \\"Candy Shop\\" are prime examples. The subject matter has not changed from the first go-round, but the approach is quite different: 50  left the fun-spirited mood of GRODT for a darker one. <br /> <br />He stepped up somewhat in the lyrics department and that's good to see. His hooks have gotten tighter as well - he might just sucker you in with a tight chorus and disposable verses. However, there are two discernable flaws with 'The Massacre'. <br /> <br />At twenty one tracks - nineteen if you exclude the intro and the bonus - the album is bloated. Throwaway tracks like \\"So Amazing\\" and \\"I Don't Need 'Em\\" makes it unnecessarily long. Furthermore, it lacks a clear direction. It feels more like a compilation rather than album. 50 Cent's attempts to cater to his various audiences are not bad at all. They just don't cohere. <br /> <br />As far as SoundScan numbers go 'The Massacre' has yet to top 'Get Rich Or Die Tryin''. It looks improbable that it ever will. <br /> <br /> <br />5Fold for ThaHipHop.Com
B00006V9A0|5.0|I think this album provides all that is needed to any would-be or already Nirvana fans. Although, I have to admit this list is limited, in a sense that it has been compressed down to the essentials. Therefore, I don't think all Nirvana listeners would be totally pleased with the selection, and on a level, I agree. But I suppose if someone were to put every extra desired track on this album, it wouldn't fulfil it's purpose of being the concise Nirvana record it set out to be. In general, if you want the best of Nirvana simply on one CD...this is the one for you.
1400032717|5.0|\\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\" by Mark Haddon is a very fascinating and tasteful read that begins as a mystery while the reader climbs into the mind of a 15-year-old autistic boy named Christopher John Francis Boon. <br />  <br />Regularly, Chrsitopher unwittingly causes social discomfort with his rocking, groaning and constant solving of math problems. Sometimes he solves formulas inside his head -- and sometimes he works them out verbally. Regardless, Christopher is constantly intellectualizing (while emotions are beyond his cognizance) and when he discovers a neighbor's pet has been impaled with a pitchfork he has difficulty understanding how his attempts to honor the dead dog, and his behavior after the fact, causes a misunderstanding that lands him in jail. <br />  <br />When loved ones want to comfort or guide him, Christopher remains emotionally and physically distant (unless he is punching out to block a hug) but that's because THEY are difficult to understand, not him. <br /> <br />Investigating the dog's murder in a very linear fashion, without any regard for the social consequences, sends this boy on a revealing journey that unveils a great deal of family pain and parental dysfunction. <br />  <br />Christopher's thought processes cause the reader to consider that superstitions really do make decision-making much easier and brown really is undesirable as the color of poop. What's more, people seldom speak in direct terms or say exactly what they mean (or mean what they always say).   <br /> <br />Mark Haddon's book is a very fun and entertaining read while it also challenged this reader to consider why do I (personally) typically process information in the manner that I do.
B000B8QEYC|2.0|It seems that many would disagree with me on this, but I was very disappointed with this CD.  And believe me, I absolutely love Enya!  However, I still have not been able to listen to Amarantine's songs in their entirety because I find myself so irritated...not by the music itself, mind you, but by the lyrics!<br /><br />While Enya's music is as beautiful and moving as ever, Roma Ryan's lyric-writing skills leave much to be desired.  They are extremely shoddy, cheesy, and make it seem as if she is an amateur.  The only tracks I like to listen to are the opening track and the one without lyrics...the others I find to be spoiled by her bad rhymes and repetitive, boring words.  I will grant that the Loxian language is nice, but that's all I can compliment Mrs. Ryan with.<br /><br />If you're looking for a more enjoyable Enya CD, I recommend that you look to her earlier work.

0441012906|2.0|I've enjoyed this author's work up until I read Diamond Dogs / Turquoise Days. I don't like to read the back of the book cover, as this tends to give too much away... so when I read that book and found it was two novellas... well I was upset. Especially since the first novella is only the first half of a story and abandons itself to nothing. <br /> <br />Anyway, I gave him another chance with Century Rain. $25.00 Canadian for the large format paperback... and honestly, this book is trash. <br /> <br />When a character made the \\"slash gesture followed by a stab at the heart\\", I groaned out loud.  <br /> <br />With the direct Casablanca references... again, this is just too much. The mysteries in the book are revealed to implausible and problematic truths one by one, with loose ends left unappealingly loose. It's the kind of book that I open and read with enjoyment, then slowly as I feel my intelligence being abused I get more angry. As the story progresses, it is like being a little child running downhill... first it is enjoyable and fun, then it starts to trip, then finally falls flat on its own stupid head. <br /> <br />The ending of this book is probably the worst that I have ever read since I have been reading SF. <br /> <br />By the last few pages which I was just scanning to get the direction of the plot so I could rid myself of this monstrosity, I finally knew why it felt so lame. This book reads like a BAD Star Trek episode. <br /> <br />It's got the fedoras, it has the \\"what if this important event in history\\" didn't happen, it has the cheesy lines, it has the romance based on nothing but proximity, it has the technobabble, and it has the \\"sad\\" and inevitable parting of the ways. <br /> <br />And how many \\"last second saves\\" from disaster are there? OH NO THE BOMB IS TICKING DOWN TO 1 SECOND WHOA CLOSE CALL THE HERO SAVED THE DAY (again). This kind of crap. An entire book stuffed with this kind of thing. Really there is no feeling of pressure or obstacle, you just keep waiting for the next variation of reconfiguring the main deflector dish to emit a tachyon pulse to save the day. You know it is coming, and you are never dissapointed. This is not tension unless you are 10 years old. <br /> <br />So this review is reading pretty disjoint and awful itself, but I can't really be bothered to try to put together a scholarly masterpiece. I just feel ripped off by spending $25.00 on this piece of junk.  <br /> <br />I long for the days when I could pick up a Heinlein book at the used bookstore for 50 cents and get a good read, and if not, heck, I was out 25 cents. $25.00 could have bought me a nice bottle of wine and a good buzz, instead of taken a handful of hours out of my life that I can never get back.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I have to admit that I was never a huge fan of \\"Firefly\\", but enjoyed the series enough to be excited to see the movie.  The series was cut off early in the development of a strong story line, that to me, was the whole draw to the show, River. <br />I never expected the movie to be this good... not just good, great!  Talk about closing a book!  Every loose end was tied up into a bow.  I watched it with a small group of people and even the ones that had never heard of the TV series enjoyed the movie.  The writing was excellent, the actors brought reality to the movie, and I finished it thinking that I needed to go back and watch the TV series over again. <br />Bravo!
0060516070|5.0|Peter Drucker died on November 11, 2005 at the age of 95. His life and work spanned sixty years and he left behind a body of knowledge and ideas that continue to influence all knowledge workers today. In this book he demonstrates an uncanny ability to see organizations in all their complexity and reduce management problems to their essentials. Like a virtuoso musician, he rarely hits a wrong note, and each idea blends flawlessly with the next. He provides a complete model for management effectiveness that is theoretically sound and solidly based on his experience. This is perhaps the most useful of his 38 books and distills a lifetime of management consulting into a few concise lessons that get to the root of what managers need to do. It provides a complete course in management in a thin book of just 192 pages.     Drucker starts by arguing that all knowledge workers are executives and that effectiveness should be defined as \\"getting the right things done.\\" He develops his ideas from real experience, supporting them using real-life stories of successes and failures taken from business and politics. He structures the book around five essential practices, which he found all effective managers have in common: 1) track where your time goes; 2) focus on your outward contribution; 3) build on strengths (yours and others'); 4) do first things first; and 5) -- perhaps most interesting and least intuitive -- follow a decision-making process that builds on opinions and encourages dissent.    In elaborating these five essential practices, Drucker presents many insightful findings. However, what is most impressive about the book is not any particular idea or piece of advice, but how his many ideas are tied together into a coherent whole, leading to practical advice on how to do things better.    My own experience of the last 30 years indicates that, in spite of much thought and many advances, management has not improved greatly in the past 100 years. Drucker's lessons haven't got passed on to individual managers in the organizations in which I've worked. These were mostly managed by untrained and inexperienced executives and demonstrated typical levels of dysfunction. In large companies, small companies, failed startup companies, failed acquisitions of entrepreneurial companies by larger companies and failed business reengineering efforts, I've experienced many examples of Drucker's advice not being followed -- including all of the following:  - Managers who consistently spent too much time managing crises and left important work undone   - Culture that evolved into a culture of fear and blame, where heroes were worshipped and winners took all the rewards   - Poor, hasty decisions that were made by high level executives based on insufficient information   - Banishment of dissent and an unwritten policy of \\"don't ask, don't tell\\"     Could these failures have been avoided or is managing just too hard? Drucker's criteria for effective management are simple, but not easily followed. Drucker points out that executives tend towards ineffectiveness unless they put energy into the five practices. Although people don't set out to be bad managers, I've frequently seen good people rendered ineffective by the burden of impossible jobs, by mindless assumptions that could not be disputed, and by decisions that could not be questioned. The drive and energy needed to fix this has to come from an extraordinary and dedicated leader -- and this rarely happens. In the same way that entropy dictates that natural systems tend towards disorder, the natural order of organizations dictates that energy drains out of companies and their managers until they become dysfunctional. Hence the frequent rise and fall of our organizations, which are a microcosm for the rise and fall of our nations and civilizations.     It would be hard to read this book and not gain from the experience, but although Drucker was a journalist and his writing is lucid and well-structured, his old-fashioned style makes his book less easy to read than it might be. Also, Drucker's ego sometimes gets in the way. For example, he rarely acknowledges his influences, and when he does, it's usually people he consulted with, like Alfred Sloan, Jr of General Motors, from whom he can claim credit by association. He appears to come up with his huge fund of ideas as if from thin air. This is unfortunate, because there would be great value in understanding where his ideas came from and their links to the ideas of like-minded experts in related areas of thought. For example, one aspect of executive effectiveness that is strikingly missing from his model is motivation. Drucker doesn't address what drives people to excellence and how managers can motivate others.    Drucker may have passed on, but his ideas have not. Minor criticisms aside, this could be the only book you need on your path to becoming a better manager. As Drucker says, \\"Self-development of the executive toward effectiveness is the only available answer. It is the only way in which organization goals and individual needs can come together.\\" Effectiveness can be learned and the five habits are a good place to start. Certainly Drucker's ideas could be worked into any training program and his book provides the material for a life-time's work of self-improvement. You will learn a great deal by simply reading the book and relating it to your experience and it may inspire you to make some significant changes in the way you do your work.    Graham Lawes

B00005JO1Y|5.0|This IS the best movie of 2005. There is too many good things to say about this movie.<br /><br />1. The action is spectacular! I was literally on the edge of my seat for the last 2 1/2 hours(the first 1/2 hour was a wee bit slow but the movie wouldn't be the same without it).<br /><br />2. The special effect were fantastic. \\"The popcorn movie of the millennium, setting a new standard for special effects wizardry.\\"Jamie Gillies, APOLLO GUIDE says.<br /><br />3. The story is the best! It is 1933, and vaudeville actress Ann Darrow (Oscar® nominee for 21 Grams, NAOMI WATTS) has found herself-like so many other New Yorkers during the Great Depression-without the means to earn a living. Unwilling to compromise and allow herself to sink into a career in burlesque, she considers her limited options while aimlessly wandering the streets of Manhattan. When her hunger drives her to unsuccessfully try to steal an apple from a fruit vendor's stall, she is rescued-literally- by filmmaker and multiple hyphenate Carl Denham (JACK BLACK of The School of Rock).<br /><br />It seems that the entrepreneur-raconteur-adventurer is no stranger to theft, having that day lifted the only existing print of his most recent and unfinished film from under his studio executives' noses when they threatened to pull his completion funds. Carl has until the end of the day to get his crew onboard the Singapore-bound tramp steamer, the S.S. Venture, in hopes of completing his travelogue/action film. With that, the showman is certain he will finally achieve the personal greatness he knows awaits him around the corner...and although the crew believe that corner to be Singapore, Denham actually hopes to find and capture on film the mysterious place of legend: Skull Island.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Carl, his headlining actress has pulled out of his project, but his search for a size-four leading lady (the costumes have all been made) has, fatefully, led him to Ann. The struggling actress is reluctant to sign on with Denham, until she learns that the up-and-coming, socially relevant playwright Jack Driscoll (Oscar® winner for The Pianist, ADRIEN BRODY) is penning the screenplay-the fees his friend Carl pays for potboiling adventure are a welcome supplement to Driscoll's nominal income from his stage plays.<br /><br />With his newly discovered star and coerced screenwriter reluctantly onboard, Denham's \\"moving picture ship\\" heads out of New York Harbor...and toward a destiny that none aboard could possibly foresee.(King Kong)<br /><br />4.

German star THOMAS KRETSCHMANN (U-571) portrays Captain Englehorn, commander of the Venture, who allows Denham and his ever-increasing bribes to persuade him to endanger the lives of his crew by searching for Skull Island. COLIN HANKS (Orange County) is Preston, Denham's put-upon assistant and unwitting moral compass, who attempts to keep his boss in check and the production from spiraling out of control. Young actor JAMIE BELL (Billy Elliot) plays Jimmy, the youngest crew member, whose experiences onboard the Venture prove more fantastical than any old salt's seafaring yarn. EVAN PARKE lends his talents to the role of first mate Hayes, keeping a watchful eye on young Jimmy and serving as Englehorn's conscience.

B00005JO1Y|4.0|I knew the movie was three hours long before I saw it, and I still went to see it anyway.  I'm glad I did, because it was an incredible spectacle.  I won't go into the plot, it's pretty basic, but I think a good job was done setting up the plot so you could understand why the characters were there, what everyone's motivation was, etc. I thought the scenes where they arrived at Skull Island were incredible, realistic and scary. Some people are noting the fact that Naomi Watt's character, Ann Darrow, was never scratched up or hurt after her many ordeals (something my husband and I also noted), but this is a fantasy adventure, and if you can believe in a 25-foot ape and dinosaurs, why is it a stretch to believe her character was unhurt through everything? It was a smidge long, but I found it enjoyable. Why analyze?

0785819118|5.0|Many people assume that Darwin's initial account of natural selection is so out of date that it is to be avoided in favour of more recent text books of evolutionary theory. While it is true that huge gains have been made in the one and a half centuries since the first publication of \\"The Origin\\", there is nothing in this work which is wrong. Darwin was too good a scientist and too cautious.<br /><br />Some claim that Darwin admitted of the possibility of Lamarkian mechanisms. They have not read the original. Darwin knew nothing of the molecular basis of genetics, but knew that natural selection did not need a Lamarkian mechanism. He simply did not rule it out, although he found it improbable. Everything that is stated in this great classic is as true today as it was at the time of first publication.<br /><br />It is also said that Charles Darwin was a lesser intellectual when compared to most other great names of science; that he was a plodder, a naturalist, a sort of gentleman stamp collector who pressed flowers into his books and barely a scientist in the contemporary sense. This is nonsense. Darwin was one of the giants of rigorous systematic thinking; the kind of rigorous thinking and critical attitude that asks the right questions and provides the capacity to answer them. Let me buttress this claim with one example.<br /><br />At the end of chapter six Darwin noted that the theory of natural selection could not account for structures or behaviors found in one species that exist solely for the benefit of another unrelated species. In setting out the theoretical terms for the refutation of the theory in this way, he anticipated Karl Popper, that analytical non-nonsense philosopher of science, by more than a century.<br /><br />I recommend you read this book with an attentive curious analytical mind. You will find yourself walking in the footsteps of an intellectual giant.

B0007GAERG|3.0|I'm not really that into Mariah's music. But I heard the single, and I bought the album. There are a few good songs on here, but on the whole I don't \\"love\\" it. There's one song on the album that sounds like Nelly, but it's actually Jermaine Dupre. Scary.
B00003CXB4|4.0|I thought that having this version of The Lion King was great. I loved the new song that they updated into it, called \\"The Morning Report.\\" A lot of the Bonus stuff was great, too. I enjoy exploring a lot of it. Except that, even though I checked it out in excited curiosity, too, I didn't like a lot of how the Personality Profile went. I love Personality Profiles, by the way. I am a fan of them. I think they're fun! It's fun to put people in a box as best as you can, but this Personality Profile was way off. Even with how Zazu describes you at the end, if you are most like a character that he has pasted as stars in the sky. And the Personality Profile doesn't have near enough Personality questions in it, either, to get you very accurately. Having lots and lots of questions in one game instead of just a few is the only way that you can come up with a very accurate assessment. That is what I know. The more questions are asked about what you are, that you try your best to answer, then the better and more accurately that this game that you play can put you in a box. It should also ask you and have you check off with your remote control with what you most, 2nd most, third most, etc., balanced between, and least are. And it should at least have about 100 Personality questions, to be so extremely accurate. And Zazu should have a lot more says for what you are, at the end, where he can even say a lot more what whatever is all that you checked off means that you all together correctly are. He even exaggerates how bad you are, on the one where you are most like Scar. Just because somebody tends to have a lot of the same problems that he does, doesn't mean that they are near as bad as him. Scar was like the devil! He was a Hitler in a lion's body. Besides, many people out in the World in many different ways tend to be bossy, unfeeling, impatient, intolerant, you name it, but it doesn't mean that most of them are near as bad as Scar. He was the most extreme version of it. So, Ifind a huge complaint about how bad that Zazu described that I was, when I averaged up at times on it to being most like Scar. I most definitely am not near as evil as Scar. I'm even a Christian, for Heaven's sake! But once I pick a lot of the Choleric type answers in the Personality questions that he asks me, Zazu (who narrates it) first calls me a bunch of names, and says that \\"I have an obsessive desire to rule the World, and that I didn't care what it would take to get there.\\" Then he tells me that I am a huge troublemaker. Even to the law. Then he says that I deserve to be locked up, then says that I am most like Scar. It was not very nice of him. I averaged out to being most like Nala a few times, too, and a few times being most like Timon. But the way he described me then, too, was mostly definitely not me, and also some of it was even an exaggeration of how my answers mean that I am like. So, even how Zazu describes you at the end of the test is not very accurate, no matter who he says that you are most like. And I find that as a big complaint! And not only the questions it does ask, it should also ask what you from most to least are in the whole list of Personality Types that even come out of the four basic ones, called \\"Melancholy, Choleric, Phlegmatic, and Sanguine.\\" And if it did do it that way, then it should have two seperate levels in the same game, which is where one is all your Personality Strengths, and the other one is all of your Personality Weaknesses. Then Zazu can be able to tell you at the end who you are most like in the Strengths, and who you are most like in the Weaknesses. This Personality Profile needs a whole lot of improvements. So, I wish that whoever put out this special addition would do it in the way that I wish that they would. If they did, then it would be so much more awesome and exciting. And I wish that every movie released out there would have a huge Personality Test on it, in the way here that I said that I wanted them to be like, to even tell me who in the movie that I am most like in the Strengths, and who I am most like in the Weaknesses. Also, on this, I find it a complaint, too, that the Personality Test couldn't be quiet. I didn't like it very much that there was a repeatitive stupid jungle music on all of it, and that Zazu had to name out all of the questions on the page, when anybody who reads it can read.
B00000ADG2|5.0|Whenever I'm feeling down I always put this CD on. It reminds me that everything in my life happens for a reason. If I'm going through a break up, I'm reminded that I should \\"let go and you'll let go to\\". If everything seems out of place and in complete chaos I just let Lauryn tell me that \\"everything is everything\\". She always lets me cry on her shoulder. I'd be lost if I couldn't lean on her, and her words of wisdom. Miseducated or well-informed through life experience? The latter I think.
B000ATQYT2|3.0|It was great to be able to have this movie on DVD, in clean picture and sound quality, too. It is great to have anything on DVD, even due to how clean it looks and sounds, too. But there is something that I find very objectionable about this version of \\"The Muppet Christmas Carol.\\" On this new DVD version of it, the song \\"Love is Gone\\" is removed. It existed in all of the other versions, but not in this one. So, be aware everyone out there, that there is an important song that goes right in with the original version of this movie that has been taken out, and makes it look messed up on that part in this one. It even leaves any of you who have never seen it before clueless as to why that Rizzo and Scrooge are crying, right when Scrooge requests to the Spirit of the Past to take him back to his home in the present. So, it leaves a real mess on that part of the movie, and I don't even know why the company that cleaned it up and put it on this DVD had to take out that song. That is the only problem with it! I hate it when any company cuts out any movie scenes from some movies, when they put them on DVD! With most anything, that tends to spoil how the movie is rightfully put together! So, for that sake, I recommand that you don't buy it. I would rather see the company that put this on this DVD do this special DVD version of it over again, where they put the full version of it (with the picture and sound quality still all cleaned up) on this, first.
0307236722|5.0|I've never wanted to spend so much time in the kitchen, but when I got this book, I wanted to jump right in and start straight away.  It's filled with great ideas and recipes and lots of useful and helpful information.  The pictures look great, and some of the cakes I've made look a little close to them.  This is one of the best baking books I own and I can't wait to get back in the kitchen.  It's nice having friends ask me for recipes of things I've made.  Just a note of caution; don't put on weight with all these goodies.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I saw the movie Serenity in a movie theatre, and I was so thrilled that I immidiately ordered the Firefly DVD's when I got back home. <br /> <br />There's just something with the Firefly universe that makes you feel so good. It's like I want to leap into the TV screen and become a part of it. <br /> <br />It's very unfortunate that the show got cancelled so early, but I'm very glad there was made a movie later on. <br />I really think this could be the next Star Trek.  Looking back in history, even the Star Trek shows did quite poor at first, until it was cancelled after the 3rd season.  It took quite a while before a movie was made, and despite it doing quite mediocre in the box office, the fanbase kept it going.   I hope this is what'll happen to Firefly too (or Serenity if you like). <br /> <br />I see it already, more Firefly seasons with additional \\"sub-shows\\" called ala \\"Star Trek Voyager\\" and such, with a completely different ship and different crew, just the same universe. <br /> <br />Anyway, my advice to anyone who hasn't seen this show yet; GO BUY THESE GORRAM DVD'S! <br /> (then watch the movie Serenity).  You certainly won't regret it!
B00005JO9J|4.0|Yeah I like this; I've always loved Patrick Dempsey (from the Can't Buy Me Love and Loverboy days) and I like the Renee Zellweger look-alike Ellen Pompeo, but the show hasn't done for me what ER or other top rated shows have done.  The humour is good and the story lines are good, but it's just not gripping enough.  I'm hoping that Dr Shepherd (Dempsey) will come to his senses and get back with Grey (Pompeo), but who knows.  They'll keep us on the edge of our seats for this I'm sure.  Anyway, for a bit of lighthearted fluff, this would be a good choice for you.  For something along the lines of ER, skip it.
B00003CXAW|5.0|A milestone achievement in cinematic amazement and ranked number 33 on AFI's list of the 100 best American films, 1933's King Kong proudly and fully deserves that grand privilege. Featuring some of the most complex and impressive visual effects ever created, it has since the time of its release become a timeless classic that fabulously stands the test of time with its large-scale thrills, romance, adventure, horror, and tender emotions. The film features many iconic images and quotes including the infamous T-Rex versus Kong battle, the climactic confrontation atop the New York's Empire State Building, which although results in the giant gorilla's death because of multiple air bullet wounds, makes it ironically apparent that \\"It was beauty killed the beast.\\"                  Starring still-alive beauty scream queen Fay Wray as Ann Darrow, Kong's lovely obsession , Robert Armstrong as ambitious and money-hungry movie producer Carl Denham, and Bruce Cabot as the ship's first mate who is also Wray's love interest and hero. Denham casts down-on-her-luck Darrow as the leading lady in his latest adventurous and groundbreaking motion picture, who together with the ship's brave crew venture into the sea towards the ominous and gloomy Skull Island in search of a fascinating spectacle and exotic locations for his upcoming picture. Little did they suspect that this mysterious island is home to creatures right out of the Prehistoric era including dinosaurs and reptiles who are all no match for the island's biggest and most astonishing beast, the mighty King Kong. Kong is worshiped by the local native islanders, and upon the arrival of the film crew, ferociously kidnap the gorgeous and harmless Ms. Darrow from the ship to use her as a sacrifice to summon the beastly Kong from the depths of the jungle.                  Without further adue, let's get down to business and marvel at the exciting long-awaited DVD package Warner Bros. is releasing. The new image and sound restoration is hands-down amazing considering the film and audio elements the DVD restoration had to work with. The sound is generally clear with only some lines being slighly difficult to understand. And for a film that is more than 72 years old, the picture looks mighty wonderful and worthy of well-deserved recognition. The jungle scenes come to vivid life right before your eyes, and although expectedly there is some mild wear apparent in the print, it is not bothersome and does not diminish the grand overall experience. A generous platter of bonus features is offered, although they are mostly reserved for the second disc, save for a lively and engagingly informative commentary track featuring technical wizard Ray Harryhausen, the film's leading actress Fay Wray, and Kong's granddaddy Merian C. Cooper with Ken Ralston, and also an interseting Merian C. Cooper trailer gallery including this film and its sequel, and some John Wayne westerns.                      Now, the second disc is where this disc really shines in the extras department. Although there are only two choices selectable from the main menu, the 3 hours + content found within thoroughly dissect and analyze this classic inspirational adventure. In the Peter Jackson (director of the 2005 remake of this film)helmed behemoth 158-minute 7-part documentary entitled RKO Production 601: The Making of Kong, Eighth Wonder of the World,  nearly every possible aspect of this 1933 classic is exhaustingly covered, from the groundbreaking and mesmerizing stop-motion animation effects to the casting, the life of its creator Merian C. Cooper before the film, filming the New York scenes, to Willis O'Brien, the sculptor and creator of the monster seen in the movie. Interesting anactedotes from its once-blonde leading beauty Fay Wray and other participants are also noteworthy, as are presentations of models by the production crew of the new 2005 remake set in the Depression- era 1930s. Included in the retrospective documentary's menu is also the infamous lost spider pit sequence with optional commentary by Ray Harryhausen, ehich is quite intriguing and like the film itself a marvel to behold.                    The second option on the second disc's main menu, I'm Kong: The Exploits of Merian C. Cooper  is a 56-minute new biographical documentary piece focusing on the legacy of the man behind the monster. This documentary was produced exclusively by the TCM channel, and is a captivating overview of an important man who changed the face of cinema forvever through his unique masterpiece. Both of the documentaries included on this package are fascinating portraits of a screen classic's legacy and are well-worth a watch.                Overall, King Kong is undoubtedly one of the best and most magnificent tales ever brought to the screen, and features one of the most unforgettable characters ever conceived: King Kong. And now with this glorious new 2-Disc set, everyone who even slightly appreciates cinema can proudly make it part of their DVD library. A must-have and definitely a must-see.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Original, witty, good characters and story!
B00005JLWN|5.0|Amazon recommended this movie to me and I spent a month trying to track it down at Blockbuster before I was finally able to get my hands on it.  It was certainly worth the wait!  I watched it three times before I returned it to Blockbuster, and I bought it soon after.  It quickly became one of my favorite sci-fi movies. <br /> <br />This movie is beautifully made.  It's dark and largely lacks color, but the setting fits the tone and subject of the movie well.  The filming also serves to distinguish the lack of emotion expressed by a majority of the characters and the colorful world of the \\"sense offenders.\\"  Although it's nigh impossible for any actor to pull off a complete and total lack of emotion (though if anyone can do it well, it's Christian Bale), I was thoroughly impressed by the skill of the actors.  Being the type of person I am, I watched the movie the first time looking for slips in character where the actors betrayed an emotion, and was disappointed to find some.  I was thrilled at the end to discover that they weren't slips at all, but clues to the complex personalities of the characters and all furthered the story.  Bale and Diggs make an excellent pair, and Watson and the child playing Bale's son were very effective characters.  The casting of this movie is quite good. <br /> <br />I also loved the story.  The subject matter is appealing to me in general, but I was particularly impressed by the specific plot of this movie.  I loved the idea that people chose to suppress emotions, have propaganda spewed at them incessently, and kill their family members and neighbors when they didn't conform.  It's much like what's happened in the US recently or in the USSR 50 years ago - people giving up their freedoms for the illusion that they are safe and protected from harm.  The fall of Bale's character, the elite member of the policing agency enforcing the emotionless state, is particularly moving.  The scene where Bale discovers the basement full of sentimental objects and breaks down upon hearing Beethoven will stick with me forever.  I was so blown away by the display of emotion Bale managed in that scene. <br /> <br />Aside from the great visuals and deep story, this movie is entertaining as an action movie.  The mix of gun fights and martial arts is fun, the special effects wonderful, and the story moves right along.  All in all, this is a great movie, and one I would recommend to anyone who likes post-apocalyptic sci-fi movies or is interested in seeing and intelligent action movie. You won't be disappointed.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|The DVD I have in my head is a super extended one with all the scenes Peter Jackson must have filmed and then had to cut out to get the running time under four hours.<br /><br />These are the scenes everyone reports missing, the loose ends that leave you walking out of the theater thinking, well I got my money's worth of spectacle and action and passion and scenery, but what happened to X and Y?  For example, I'm still waiting for the \\"reveal\\" that would explain where Jamie Bell came from, when Mr. Hayes found him on the boat four years earlier as wild as any animal!  Wouldn't Jimmy, the wild child, have made a good pal for  Kong?  Or was the back story that his mom and dad had been murdered by Kong and that's why he insisted on joining the rescue party--as a way to destroy his nemesis?  On the DVD, we shall see!<br /><br />Same with those natives.  Okay, once they send Ann Darrow on that weird wooden catapult thing to Kong as a human sacrifice they pretty much drop out of the action of the movie, but I wanted them brought back and shown a little human dignity!  I'm not black but if I were, I would be protesting the treatment of racial issues in this movie with both barrels.  Come on, those natives, OK, they were scared of Kong, but were they also possessed by Satan?  They seemed like out=takes from THE EXORCIST part FOUR!  However I expect the extended DVD will clear this up, as well as explain how the tiny crew managed to lug Kong's body back onto the steamer and keep him sedated all the way back to Manhattan.<br /><br />Until then, I'm not too overly concerned with the loose ends.<br /><br />Watts should get the Oscar for she almost makes us believe that her Ann Darrow could actually fall in love with a giant ape.  Like everyone else, I did think her a little callous screaming, \\"No, No, save the ape, don't shoot him!\\" to the Captain and all the crew who have just busted their asses trying to save her (when they capture Kong).  Show a little gratitude, Ann, it doesn't hurt and it doesn't cost a dime, even in the Depression!  But from the beginning, she is haunted by fate, and she plays it like it was a tragedy, which is appropriate.  Oh, how I wanted her elderly stage friend, \\"Manny,\\" to come back at the end to shake her hand.  But I guess when he said he was going back to Kansas after their show closed, he meant it.<br /><br />One final thing, the Captain, played by Thomas Kretschman, was th e real hero of the movie in many ways, and yet I can never shake from my mind how horrifyingly sadistic Kretschman was to poor Asia Argento in THE STENDHAL SYNDROME all those years ago when he as young and so ultra handsome!  He is among the best and most arresting actors in the world, good for Jackson for reeling him into the world of KING KONG!  And I'm sure the DVD will have scenes of him enjoying R & R in Manhattan or trawling the waterfront for a new crew and a new supply of chloroform--which, if you know your Argento, you will recall he also used to Asia Argento when he raped her in that strange cave space with the weird paintings all over it., it doesn't hurt and it doesn't cost a dime, even in the Depression!

0062502182|5.0|Easy fun dreamy adventure with what ifs, what does this all mean etc.
B00005K3O4|3.0|Clearly the creators of this movie were hoping to craft a camp classic, and certainly \\"Killer Klowns\\" has all the hallmarks of campiness.  Obviously so over the top that it could never possibly be taken seriously, \\"Killer Klowns\\" wants to thought of as \\"so bad it's good,\\" so criticizing the overall awfullness of the movie is really beside the point.<br /><br />The problem is, the general ineptitude in direction manifests itself in the pacing & editing of the film.  The result is something like watching a production of the high school drama club:  part of you wants to laugh, but the production has such a combination of earnestness and listlessness that you feel more sorry than anything else towards everyone involved, not to mention a bit bored.<br /><br />The impact of the truly bizarre nature of the film will have long worn off before \\"Killer Klowns\\" trudges towards its uninspired finish.  You will have seen all you need to of this film probably in the first 30 minutes, so you can save yourself the trouble of viewing the rest.
0060589280|5.0|I find myself leaning towards non-fiction and adventure in places I have been or yearn to go to.

B000BZ9DKW|3.0|Rate 5 for the movie, 1 for the gift set. <br /> <br />I just bought 2 of the gift sets online at Bestbuy.com for 21.99 each, although perhaps stock is based on regional availability ? <br /> <br />Anyway, here's the scoop:  The new edition of the movie \\"Special Edition with Flair\\" (which you can buy solo for about 12.99) is worth it - even if only for all the computer stuff: sound effect files, and a small computer game.  The gift set, however, is not really worth it, especially for a die hard fan. <br /> <br />The extras are really cheesy.  They are all stamped with an \\"Office Space Special Edition with Flair\\" logo as well as one for Twentieth Century Fox.  The red stapler is not a Swingline - it is a VERY cheap little plastic number which will probably break after a few uses.  The plastic pen and pencil are crappier than the cheapest giveaway pens I have ever seen.  The mug has the logos as mentioned, and a really low-res picture of Lumburg on it.  The magnet frame is similarly cheap - perhaps suitable for the office fridge (if you can sneak it in when no one is looking).  The mouse pad is OK, but with phrases like \\"revenge to the fax on it\\" (when clearly it should say \\"revenge to the printer\\") you can tell the extras weren't put together by fans of the movie - more likely marketing weasels from Dilbert world.  Lastly, the TPS report memo sheets are kind of cool, with the Initech logo and the image of the fish innards on them - but then the movie logo kind of ruins the effect. <br /> <br />That said, this would make the perfect gift for an office party, although I am going to buy just the movie and a real Swingline for a gift instead. <br />
0140042520|5.0|A great Read....enjoy.
B000AMWIVM|4.0|The unrated version isn't that much different. But it adds to the movie. I think they could have put in alot more gore. But what they added was cool. I really like the movie SAW. So, I wasen't dissapointed. I liked the theater version. So, seeing a version with a little extra was a bonus.
B000002UAU|5.0|A landmark statement when it was released in the mid 60s, \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\", with just 13 tracks, rewrote the rules for what pop and rock music could extend to.  Psychedelic rock had its beginnings with groups like the Yardbirds and the Byrds, who took Avant-Garde song writing and unorthodox instrument playing and lyrics to create music that could mimic surreal dreams and LSD trips.  The Yardbirds released the hit, \\"Shape Of Things\\", and the Birds released the album, \\"5D\\", which had the hit, \\"Eight Miles High\\".  Pink Floyd's debut, \\"Piper At The Gates Of Dawn\\", revialed, \\"Sgt Pepper\\", with its psychedelic influence and after hearing, \\"Sgt Pepper\\", \\"PATGOD\\" would be the next logical purchase. <br /> <br />While Pink Floyd's album was hard, dark, and foreboding, \\"Sgt Pepper\\", had a much lighter, whimsical flavor to it; the major exception being the haunting closing number.  It opens with an orchestra warm up and classic guitar riff and then the show begins.  Your treated to Paul McCartney telling you the story of a fictional band run by frontman Billy Shears with blaring horns and pounding drums in the background.  Ringo Starr makes one of his best vocal performences with, \\"With A Little Help From My Friends\\",  a touchy song about how friends and family are one of the driving forces behind enduring human life.  \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\" was written after John Lennon saw a picture that a school girl had drawn.  The ultimate LSD anthem, you find you're no longer on earth when you give this baby a listen.  \\"Getting Better\\",  is McCartney's ode to good times to come and, \\"Fixing A Hole\\", is a psychedelic number about letting your mind wonder and be free.  \\"She Leaving Home\\", is a beautiful harp and string driven song about spreading your wings and leaving home to find new and adventurous things.  \\"Being For The Benefit Of Mr Kite!\\", is a circus song about a man who flies, which is exactly what your doing as you listen to the heavy drug inspiredinstrumentation. <br /> <br />Side two opens up with George Harrison's ode to Indian music, \\"Within You And Without You\\".  Based on Ravi Shankur's music, the song is about the life force that flows within you while your alive and then flows without you when you die.  That theme is carried over to the next song, \\"When I'm Sixty Four\\", one of the best old timer dittys ever written.  \\"Lovely Rita\\", is a charming number with it's lightweight guitar riff and saloon style piano solo.  A line in that song regarding the singer dying in a car crash added fuel to the Paul is dead rumor. <br />\\"Good Morning, Good Morning\\", is a another hard rock anthem applying about fifthteen different animal noises to the mix.  A reprise of, \\"Sgt Pepper\\", seems to close the album but its not over yet, not by a long shot! <br /> <br />\\"A Day In The Life\\", one of the Beatles' most daring works combines Avant-Garde, experimentation, psychedelia, progressive music and delivers the most impressive finale to ever close an album.  Lennon's verses about the horrors of everyday life is perfectly juxtaposed to McCartney's bridge about the simplicity of everyday life.  The massive orchestra cresendo was a daring move that causes the song to explode with power and it all ends with a E chord played on three or four different pianos and an echo that lasts 45 seconds.  The 'inner groove chatter' which lasted forever on the original vinyl copy makes no sense at all but some how it seems appropriate at the end of this incredible suite. <br /> <br />Alot of people take chances but not everybody succeeds with them.  The Beatles not only succeeded but they exceeded at everything they tried.  After Sgt Pepper everybody created psychedelic music.  Everybody including The Who, Jimi Hendrix, Rolling Stones, and even The Beach Boys drew a heavy influence off this album.  Psychedelic rock did not deserve to die off by the mid-70s and while many bands have tried to recreate it with their neo-psychedelic sounds none have ever matched it let alone did better.  For a great example of the revolutionary sound of 60s psychedelia, pick up this album (if for some reason you don't already own it) and see what it was all about during that time.

B000BBOUU4|4.0|I heard Gene Wilder took huge offense to this. Why? Doesn't someone else have a right to take a stab at converting a book into a movie? I like the original, and I like this one just as much. Gene, and all the other fans dubbing the original as sacred, should just take a HUGE CHILL PILL! This was a fun flick, Burton's best for a while, too.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I love this movie! Got it for Christmas together with Firefly and would love to see the sequel. Definitely worth spending the money.
B000001EHS|3.0|As the song asks, \\"Do you want to get rocked?\\" If so, this 15 track CD will take you back to the Big Haired 80's (and early 90's) for a ballad rock-fest.    Although I don't enjoy all of the songs equally, this CD does contain most of my personal Def Leppard favs like \\"Bringing on the Heartbreak\\", \\"Rock of Ages\\" and \\"Animal.\\"  It fails to  have a few worthy songs that rock like \\"Pyromaniac\\" and \\"Too Late for Love\\", but has some sappy ballads instead.   Some like it sappy, others like their rock hard.  I guess you can't fit 15 years of Def Leppard hits on one 80 minute CD without omissions that disappoint some of even the most die hard fans.    Purchase at your own discretion; I did, and I'm proud!  LOL!
B00003CXCT|3.0|Time to move on, there is nothing special about this set. I loved Star Wars as a kid but now it's time for something new. I have the trilogy in my collection but still have to watch it...
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Superb.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|My wife and I both love this movie. It's such a refreshing change and illustrates that you can show a comedy that is not laced with profanity and nudity to be effective. Napolean is the dork that we can all relate to in some odd way. From his odd comments (\\"I love your sleeves, they're real big\\") to his quirky habits (\\"Liger\\" drawings) we all have a hidden Napolean Dynamite waiting to be unleashed on the world. The ending of the movie is both uplifting and inspiring.  <br /> <br />I also loved the dance scene. My only regret is that we don't witness Dynamite's reaction to the audience's applause as we do his successfully elected friend (Efren Ramirez appearing as \\"Pedro Sanchez;\\" you may have already seen a \\"Vote for Pedro\\" tee shirt at a mall near you.) <br /> <br />The sub plots are also appealing. Most funny is his brother Kip's pursuit of internet chat room hottie LaFawnduh Lucas (\\"I'm 100% positive she's my soul mate.\\")  <br /> <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Why you might like Serenity.<br /><br />a. No unrealistic fake space monsters. (The Revers are humans. Explained in the movie.)<br /><br />b. High technology but the good low technology is still there. (Gun powder still works.)<br /><br />c. Mortality is real. Yes, with all the shooting somebody is going to die.(They don't turn into space zombies or raise from the dead.)<br /><br />d. No ridiculous perfect Zen type atmospheres aboard ship.(TNG,Andromeda)<br /><br />Why you might not like Serenity.<br /><br />a. You haven't watched Firefly. Check it out on DVD. Its a box set of all the episodes made and Serenity ties up some loose ends that Fox Televison left when the series was canceled.<br /><br />b. You don't like sci-fi movies.<br /><br />c. Myrid of other things. (You don't like many movies anyhow.)<br /><br />The best way to enjoy this movie is to watch Firefly first and then the movie. It will be one huge complete Sci-fi movie.

0316172324|5.0|This book is very engrossing, and although it is a relatively small book, it leaves a very broad impact.<br /><br />Essentially Gladwel talks about how first impressions are both spectacularly dead-on for experts practising their expertise, and spectacularly prejudiced for just about any layperson. Depressing as that sounds, it is a real oy to observe Gladwell's examples. They don't seem too interesitng, but boy are they ever.<br /><br />I'm very non-linear in thinking, so I enjoyed the affirmations from Gladwell's very interesting argument. He must have been driven nearly mad with passion for this topic, as the writing leaps off the page in the most glowing way!<br /><br />I heartily recommend this book.
B000003RCY|5.0|After 10 years of the release I still enjoy this album, \\"Herzeleid\\" it's pure passive-agressive sound, it has probably the best guitar riffs Rammstein will ever have. I'm about to rate each song individually so you can get an idea. <br /> <br />Wollt Ihr Das Bett In Flammen Sehen 4/5: This is an intro to what's Rammstein, it has the  riff, has the lyrics and the feeling. With this they welcome you to their world. The song itself is cool but at the end it last a bit too much. <br /> <br />Der Meister 5/5: This one liked from the very first time I heard it. It talks about the end of the world. Musically it's really good, mixing the guitar sounds with very natural drums and the synth who gives originallity to the song. <br /> <br />Weies Fleisch 5/5: Your white flesh excites me, yeah that's it. It brings us the first solo of the album. Here, the synths play like a mysterious role due to the song theme. Very good song. <br /> <br />Asche Zu Asche 5/5: The favorite. It is the rawest, the best of all. You may say, \\"It's very repetitive\\", I know that but still is the best and the coolest. I love this song. <br /> <br />Seemann 5/5: What a beautiful ballad. The bass makes the whole song, the beautiness in Till's voice moves you deeply. It's calm until the guitars show up but still it stays melodic and pretty. The lyrics are awesome and the strings in the last chorus are very moving too. Probably one of the best you'll ever hear in Rammstein history. <br /> <br />Du Riechst So Gut 5/5: The very first single and no wondering why, the song represents the whole album itself. It has the rawness and the agressiveness along with the madness we all need sometimes. <br /> <br />Das Alte Leid 4/5: This is the longest song of all Rammstein's songs. But yet is very intriguing and tough with a little bit of soft lyrics. I'm kidding, there's no soft lyrics in this album or any Rammstein album. And if sometimes you can figure out the keyboard solo please let me know. The bad part is thatis too long. <br /> <br />Heirate Mich 5/5: It starts with a deep choir along with Till's deep voice. I think \\"Heirate Mich\\" is the most creepy song of the album. It has the mistery and suspense we want in a horror story. And by horror I mean read the lyrics. For me it has the best riff just like Asche Zu Asche. <br /> <br />Herzeleid 4/5: The song gives the name to the album. When I try to picture this song, it reminds me of a big machine working overtime. You can see the movements and you can imagine that this machine is suffering. The only thing, let's say bad of the song is that the way is sang. But that's it. <br /> <br />Laichzeit 5/5: The funniest song, man if you read the lyrics you'll laugh a little. The synths are very involved here. I like the way the guitars change and the slowing at the end. berall Fischmilch!!! <br /> <br />Rammstein 5/5: Their first song. You get the feeling from the beginning that this is a good and not too ordinary song. It talks about the tragedy in Ramstein, Germany, when some airplanes fell and kill about 80 people, that's where this band got their nama just adding the letter \\"M\\". The song is very interesting and gives the impression of pain and suffering. <br /> <br />This album will never be repeted in any way, it's very unique and special. You shall buy it 'cause you won't regret it.
0783230370|5.0|Little do people know, this is actually a documentary based on 9 months of Arnold Schwartzeneggar's life. It is truly a miracle and only the Los Angeles medical community knew about it. Most people said it was the second coming of Jesus, others said it was the anti-christ. Me? I say it makes a kickass movie. I'll never forget Arnold yelled \\"I'm pregnant! Get me to the doctor!\\".  <br /> <br />I watched this movie while drinking Mountain Dew and eating a 99 cent hot dog. It paled in comparison to watching this movie. You'll probably find this movie between Jingle All the Way and Jaws. Ask yourself if you're in the mood for a Christmas comedy, Arnold Schwartzeneggar's life, or people getting eaten by sharks. Rent/Buy this movie. Now.
B00003CXCT|5.0|It's great.  It's not perfect, but it's just right.  Heck, it's STAR WARS.  The DVD set is worth having, not only for the perqs of DVD vs. VHS, but also for the commentary & for the extra features.  Some of the changes, like Hayden Christensen as Anakin in the last scene of Jedi, or the celebrations on the various planets, are a nice touch.  George Lucas actually talks about the story more in these commentaries, whereas in Episodes I-III, the commentary is about the technical aspects of the film and less about the story and characters.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|London, 1979. <br />The punk scene was flooding with trashy third rate bands that were basically everything but Punk. <br />The Sex Pistols break up. <br />Hardcore Punk bands are begining to brew. <br /> <br />Heres how the Clashs musical changes go. <br />Their first album, The Clash, typical punk, fairly rocky and raw, like always - political lyrics. <br />Their second album, Give Em Enough Rope, the first step in their transition from rock 'n' roll to... pretty much everything else. Not bad, but one of their weakest albums. <br />Their fourth album, Sandinista!, explores most genres out there, quite a lot of fillers but some outstanding music in the mix. <br />Their fifth album, Combat Rock, their shortest album, some of their best work in here. <br />Their last album, Cut The Crap, the original line up is no more, this album has one good song (This is England) and 12 superfluous tracks. <br /> <br />Obviously in there lies a third album, right in the middle of their transition from classic punk to ultra-experimentation lies the best album of the eighties (Rolling Stone), the 3rd best British album ever (BBC), and the 8th greatest album off all time (Rolling Stone): London Calling. <br /> <br />This album was the perfect anitdote for all the classic punk around in that era. Like every good punk band has done, The Clash did their own thing, and as they matured, so did the music they made. No longer would they have to yell along side buzzsaw guitar to get their message across. The more mellower, more commercial sound obviously gave them more wide spread fame, but also, not streched, but broke the boundries of what punk music could be. The Clash tore down the walls, \\"killed rock 'n' roll\\" (as they claimed) and revolutionised a revolution in 19 of the best songs my ears have been graced with. <br /> <br />Lyrically, this album is outstanding. Muscially, this album is perfect. <br />Beyond perfection. <br />I cant really explain the feeling I get from this, but thisis the only album, with the possible exception of Never Mind the Bollocks, to REALLY move me. 'The Card Cheat' is my personal favourite, the music is unexplainably brilliant, I'm listneing to it now and i cant sit still. My foot is bouncing while the piano fills my body with grace not experienced from anything else. <br /> <br />While this feeling is most abundant in 'The Card Cheat' it is still there in most of the other songs, especially 'I'm Not Down', 'Death or Glory', 'London Calling', 'Clampdown' and 'Spanish Bombs'. The only tracks I consider weak are 'Lovers Rock' and 'Revolution Rock', I dont really know why, but to me they just lack something. These are not really bad songs, just up against the rest they seem to be missing something the rest have. <br /> <br />While 'The Card Cheat' is my favourite musically, 'Death or Glory' is my favourite lyriclly. I appears to be explaing, with utter truth, the situation of the Clash in the punk scene, and explaining their musical changes. While the rest of the punk bands 'staying true to their roots' fade away, the Clash have managed to stay in the light and make history in the process. Look up the lyrics to really get what I mean. <br /> <br />Some other reviewer said this album wasnt punk. The Clash were, are and always will be punk. Just becasue the music isnt typical punk, the lyrics and the energy are as punk as anything. This album is far from a sell out as all the good punkers experimented a bit, or a lot and most of the time they hit gold (Clash, late Buzzcocks, Public Image Limited). They were all just doing their own thing, which is what Punk is all about. Just like The Sex Pistols was exactly what England needed in '76, London Calling was exactly what England, and punks everywhere, needed in '79. <br /> <br />- <br /> <br />Just some useless album info that some might not know, but Train in Vain was written and recored in one night becasue they were going to give it out free in a newspaper or something. Butafter the Clash had made it they were told they wernt going to do the newspaper thing anymore. They had already recorded and arranged the London Calling album with the cover images all printed, but they thought Train in Vain was too good to waste to they just stuck it on the end of the album, which is why it was originally unlisted on the back of the record. <br /> <br />Also this was released in December '79 in England, but January 1980 in America, which explains Rolling Stones' \\"best album of the eighties\\".
0195170776|3.0|Purchased this as a gift and was astonished when the recipient showed me an obvious error on the first day of use.  The entry for Howard Dean lists his tenure as governor of Vermont as 1885-2003. Not bad for a guy born in 1948.  So, I went to their website [...] hoping to find a way of reporting the error.  It lists dozens of editors but none for reference works. Nor does it have an email address for the department responsible for the this product. <br /> <br />One wonders if the publisher's marketing department shows the typical arrogant disdain for the opinions of end user purchasers in favor of wholesale outlets.  Making it near impossible to report errors seems to indicate they just don't give a damn.  If the publisher changes the website to make error reporting possible in the future, then I would revise my rating upward.
0307276902|5.0|Simply stated, this is one of the most amazing books I have ever read. Frey takes us down a road many of us thankfully will not experience, that of addiction. Frey's first hand account describes the physical and psychological hell one goes through while going through the process of detoxification. The imagery of his accounts make me thankful I have never had to go through what he did.  <br /> <br />This is a book which should be required reading for school aged children. If one child stays away from drugs after reading of Frey's harrowing ordeal, it will have done a world of good.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Like the Strokes' first two efforts, \\"First Impressions of Earth\\" is a treasure that avails its gifts upon the third or fourth listen rather than immediate fructose for the ear. Guitarist Nick Valensi continues his impressive trajectory into the stratosphere of modern-rock technical masters with some fearsome and adventurous lead work - while complements Albert Hammond's Christmas-time chiming chords - and we are treated to the usual slightly off-kilter but rock-solid (and ever-hardening) studio consistency from bassist Nikolai Fraiture and the requisite drum machine-styled rattle from Fab Moretti. The songwriting has been urged up a notch in beauty and quality, and there are some great `70s AM-radio major scale resolutions and particularly phenomenal codas for the tracks. Many songs at first contact appear to be slow and calculated, but they reveal themselves to be just as artful as we have come to expect from the Strokes. Unlike those of their many college-rock imitators, the Strokes' new songs are all sophisticated without being museum pieces; the album consists of 14 living and breathing reptiles that will soon render extinct Franz Ferdinand, The Killers and the other Nu-Wavers. New producer David Kahne has somehow retained much of the band's NYC art-rock aesthetic while adding a welcome veneer of studio polish. Singer Julian Casablancas appears to have been successfully challenged to sing without his walkie-talkie-thru-a-payphone effect and brings out some towering performances that elbow their way up to the front of the mix. <br /> <br />\\"Juice Box\\" throbs with its nimble Munsters-theme bass line before giving way to traditional sneery Strokesian sections, a la \\"Is This It\\" cleaned up with a mop. <br /> <br />\\"You Only Live Once\\" sounds like the second part of a \\"Room On Fire\\" double-A side, replete with Cars-styled vocals and guitars. <br /> <br />\\"Heart In A Cage\\" rages into being with cascading scales from Valensi, and Casablancas' usual sense of lyrical frustration. <br /> <br />\\"Razor Blade\\" swaggers in with its lazy reggae beat, suggesting an even more tuneful sequel to \\"When It Started\\" from \\"Is This It.\\" A fine candidate for the second single after \\"Juicebox.\\" <br /> <br />\\"On the Other Side\\" is a stripped and tripped haunter with a soulful, meandering Sam Cooke chorus that will delight fans of \\"Under Control\\" from \\"Room On Fire.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Vision of Division\\" rollicks in with rocking chords that suggest Gomez or Blur. <br /> <br />\\"Ask Me Anything is a grower\\" - the usual enigmatic lyrical fare from Julian (read: \\"Don't be a coconut, God is trying to talk to you\\") backed by an interesting Mellotron-sounding loop from Valensi in the background. \\"I've got nothing to say\\" lament gets a tad stale after the first dozen incantations. <br /> <br />\\"Electricityscape\\" is another dark-to-lit puzzler. <br /> <br />\\"Killing Lies\\" has the drone of a DVD menu left on by your lazy and asleep roommate, but has that cute video-game affectation that endears us to the Postal Service and Beck's Gameboy remixes. <br /> <br />\\"Fear of Sleep\\" feels like it was written with its title afflicting the author, but it really takes off with its \\"You're no fun\\" coda. <br /> <br />\\"15 Minutes\\" is another slow-burner that goes on for about as long as its title (or so it seems), but displays some nice twinkling arpeggios from the guitars and a NYC subway-paced ending. <br /> <br />\\"Ize of the World\\" kicks off with a metal meltdown like \\"Take It Or Leave It\\" and \\"The End Has No End\\" (from their first two albums, respectively) and then pushes and shoves its way into some friendly and messy CBGBs rock chords and the requisite catchy melodies. In fact, it would be comfortably nestled somewhere in the second half of either of their first two albums. Sounds like Albert stumbling thru the solo. <br /> <br />\\"Evening Sun\\" starts off with some old-fashioned Hammond - downstroking rhythm guitar - and hammering hi-hat from Moretti, all with a bit of the Nintendo chord changes we heard on \\"Killing Lies.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Red Light\\" is an uncharacteristically cheerful romp that closes out the album.
B0007KLH1Y|5.0|I love the blocks as much as my 4 year old son and my 14 year old nephew.  We visited the Museum of Life and Science in Durham, NC this past year and discovered these blocks.  We would spend hours creating items there.  My son received a set for Christmas this year (2005) and we can not stop playing with them.  I will probably end up purchasing a 1000 box set for our home.  These blocks are worth every penny.  Children will enjoy YEARS of play and families can enjoy QUALITY TIME together.  I even enjoy playing with them for hours.

0786886811|5.0|I've been a big fan of Nigella's cooking shows and I could only hope that her books would have the same whimsy, voluptuousness, and pure gastronomical joy as expressed on TV. Domestic Goddess was my first Nigella-book purchase and I have not been disappointed. You can practically hear her voice as you read her recipe directions and food descriptions, i.e., \\"ice this pileup of gorgeousness.\\" The photos are beatiful, the paper thick and glossy. Nigella is, indeed, my own goddess of the kitchen and I'm happily collecting the rest of her books.

You'll get boring this movie and not wow scary. Nahhh!! Not worth watch and buy it..  That's your choice.. To me, I never watch again ever!! I don't really like this movie. I give thumb big down!!

B000AYEIZY|5.0|I loved Cream as a youngster - the studio albums especially. On live recordings, Cream often sounded more like three guys competing with each other than a band. NOT THIS TIME!!! The playing is still skillful and impassioned, but there is just enough restraint to allow the songs to move to the forefront. This two-disc set is a wonderful document of a tremendous, musical performance.

B000B8QEYC|2.0|Wow, never thought I'd write a bad review of any of Enya's work but........I'm hugely disappointed! I am also a BIG fan of her music but not this CD. The lyrics are poor and too repeatative, I find myself hitting the skip button on several tracks. I've listened to it several times but just can't warm up to but a couple of tracks. Recommend you skip this CD and dust off her older work.
B000BNX3AU|3.0|I like this movie and found it fuuny and romantic in which Lane shines. I liked the story and found it went smothly through the 90 min there was really no boring parts and the movie went by fast. I do not like John Cussack he is so boring(he is in every movie). The acting is good by all cast memeber except cussack I really like Stockerd Channing, Christopher Plummber and Elizabeth Perkins and espescially Diane Lane. I really like the part where Lane gose on a blind date and she finds out it's her father.
B000BKVQTS|1.0|This movie is a disaster from start to finish. It has no charm, no character development, the dialogue is hard to understand, the actors are sleepwalking and on and on and on...  For what audience was this film intended?  Although based on fairytales, it is far too graphically violent for children. It is also full of several nauseating scences of insects and the skinning of a cat.  The film is far too boring and lacking any story development to interest the average adult.  A complete bomb and a real black mark on the resume of Terry Gilliam.  Avoid at all costs.

0440211727|3.0|This is the first Grisham novel I've read.  It is definitely a page-turner, but there are some problems with the plot.  The most noticeable is that the story is basically unrealistic.  Without giving anything away, the ending was untenable.  There's no way it should end the way it does.  Another problem with A Time to Kill is how unresolved several elements of the plot are.  Characters are introduced in a haphazard and overly-convenient manner to spice up parts of the story and are, for the most part, poorly fleshed-out.  In particular, I found the Roark character and her sub-plot to be bland and even silly.  Mainly the book suffers from being too simplistic. <br /> <br />Yet, the honesty with which the main character, Jack, is portrayed lifts this book from mediocrity to being a book worth remembering.  Grisham's training as a lawyer yields a compelling glance at an attorney's mind and the legal process of jury trials.  Page after page of this book is laden with interesting and relatively little known legal idiosyncracies.  Nothing technical or dry mind you, but rather messy, nasty, politically motivated trial tactics.  Grisham clues us in on the ugly but fascinating side of the legal profession.  Some may find it repuslive, but I enjoyed it. <br /> <br />It certainly isn't the best book I've read, but I recommend it whole-heartedly as an introduction to Grisham's books.
B0000027F8|5.0|While Michael Jackson might have been anointed the \\"Artist of the Decade\\" in the 1980s, there were many artists that clearly achieved superstar status and could easily have been considered for this title.   One such artist who must be classified in this category is George Michael.   During the 1980s, George Michael probably emerged as big a superstar as any.  Michael's career reached the top during his three albums as a part of Wham! and then continued with his first solo release - the highly acclaimed \\"Faith\\" album.   Back during Michael's Wham! years (and many years before their public feud), Elton John once proclaimed Michael one of the great talents on the rise.   It was during the 1980s, that Michael demonstrated he belonged in that class.  This would culminate with Michael winning the \\"Album of the Year\\" award for 1988 at the Grammy Awards.   Michael's 80's career can basically be described as the \\"hey day\\" of MTV and music video.   For the most part, Michael was a pure Pop star.   However as 1990 approached, Michael sought to make an image change for his second album.   He desired to move toward a more \\"serious\\" approach for his second solo album, \\"Listen Without Prejudice Volume 1\\".   While it was clear the public didn't buy into this new image, this album should not be dismissed - the result is an album that is even stronger than \\"Faith\\". <br /> <br />The \\"serious\\" approach that is used on this album is nothing new.  Many artists have used the same approach.  I think it's unfair when people say an artist takes \\"him/herself too seriously\\" when they release a \\"serious\\" album.   In fact, also in 1990, Phil Collins released his \\"...But Seriously\\" album.  In my opinion that album was one of the top albums of 1990.  While Collins' approach focused on \\"serious themes\\", Michael uses \\"Listen Without Prejudice Volume 1\\" to look at himself at what he considered a career crossroads.  He opts for the most part not to continue down the pop/dance music course that he plotted into the 1990s and instead explore some other musical avenues.  Michael also makes more use of guitar, bass, and piano and less dependence on synthesizers. (It is worth noting - this is consistent with the pop music direction of the late 1980s)  Michael entitled his album \\"Listen Without Prejudice\\" for a reason.   The title is indicative that he wanted the listener to not have any preconceived notions of the sound they were expecting on this album.   The \\"Volume 1\\" is in there because there was serious talk of a follow-up album (some say the follow-up album was going to go more back to his dance-roots, but that is unconfirmed).   That \\"Volume 2\\" album would never materialize. <br /> <br />It is the second single \\"Freedom '90\\" (not to be confused with his Wham! hit \\"Freedom\\") that really tells the story of Michael reaching his career crossroads.  In this song, Michael explains gives the \\"Listen Without Prejudice\\" message to us by saying,  \\"I Won't Let You Down; I Will Not Give You Up; Gotta have some faith in the sound\\".   The song then goes into an autobiographical journey of Michael's life and career to explain how he got to this point. There are even references to Andrew Ridgeley during his Wham! days (\\"What kick just a buddy and me; We had every big shot good-time band on the run boy\\").   While Michael references how he \\"...got a brand new face; for the boys on MTV\\", he also says \\"I think it's time I stopped the show\\" and \\"sometimes the clothes do not make the man\\" - referring to putting an end to his MTV image.  The ironic thing about this song is it probably does have the most \\"Pop\\" like sound of any of the songs on this album.  However,  Michael is brilliant at writing, arranging, and ultimately performing a very believable autobiographical piece. <br /> <br />There are plenty of songs that have the more \\"natural guitar sound\\" - and all are solid tracks.   This includes \\"Waiting for that Day\\", \\"Something to Save\\" (which also includes the use of Cellos), \\"Heal the Pain\\", and \\"Waiting (Reprise)\\".  To a lesser extent, \\"Praying for Time\\" has the guitar sound.   I'm not sure why \\"Waiting\\" is a reprise because it doesn't have a strong connection to \\"Waiting for That Day\\".  It is worth noting that in \\"Waiting (Reprise)\\" , this is another song where Michael justifies his musical crossroads by saying \\"Well there ain't no point in moving on; Until you've got somewhere to go\\" and \\"Well there's one year of my life in these songs\\".  \\"Heal the Pain\\" is a very good song - it almost has a bit of a Latin/Carribean feel with the percussion and guitars.  As for \\"Waiting for that Day\\", there is a minor cover with one line of the Rolling Stones' \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" <br /> <br />Michael does a live recording cover of Stevie Wonder's \\"They Won't Go When I Go\\".  While I'm not the biggest Stevie Wonder fan, I like Michael's version - it's very soulful and heartfelt.  <br /> <br />\\"Cowboys and Angels\\" is another terrific song.   There are some outstanding string and piano arrangements that help give this song a \\"Supper Club\\" like feel.   Another nice song is \\"Soul Free\\".   This is another song that reminds me of Michael's dance/pop days, but it also is another outstanding track. <br /> <br />The liner notes include all of the lyrics and all of the musician credits.  They aren't loaded with pictures of Michael - just one black and white face shot.   I like how each song has the month/year of when the song was recorded.  A final note, the recording quality of this album is superb - and this helps bring out the best in Michael's arrangements of the music.  All in all, while I'm not the biggest George Michael fan, I could not help but be impressed by this album.  It is certainly an album I'd recommend checking out.
B00007AJGH|5.0|This has got to be my favorite movie of all time. It's got music, it's got murders, and most importantly of all, it's got TOONS!!!!!!!!! Everything a movie should have. Robert Zemeckis is a well-acclaimed director who's done films like Back to the Future and the \\"newly-released\\" Polar Express, (but those are completely different reviews... all of which should be very good). Bob Hoskins is hilarious and makes the movie seem realistic. (He's somewhat of a \\"Scrooge\\" character). Christopher Llyod is great as he portrays the villain, Judge Doom. (I like that the original concept was that he was the guy who shot Bambi's mother). Though all the actors gave a splendid performance, Charles Fleisher (the voice of Roger Rabbit) was the best. He even wore a rabbit suit on set of the film. I'm also amazed at the wonderful effect of putting toons and actors together in the same frame. (I guess that's why, \\"Roger Rabbit\\" has won an academy award.) Probably never again will anyone see Daffy Duck, Bugs Bunny, Mickey Mouse, and Donald Duck in the same frame together. Everyone who hasn't seen this should go watch the flick right now. They can last for 104 minutes. The DVD is also worthwhile, too. There are Roger Rabbit shorts that were originally seen in theaters and an interactive game in which you save Toontown. It was considered that there would be a sequel to \\"Roger Rabbit\\"; one that would go directly to video and DVD. If a sequel was made, I'm sure it would be great. In the words of the sexy Jessica Rabbit, \\"Why Don't You Do Right\\" and Zemeckis surely has done right in making this a periodic, memorable movie. It has secured a place in film history.

This book has three main aspects:  1) Listing of grammar rules related to punctuation - but you can get a much better list from Strunk & White; 2) Examples of punctuation being misused - do an internet search for \\"bad grammar\\" and you'll probably get a funnier list; and 3) Historical origins of select punctuation marks, which were interesting, but numbered only about a half dozen.
0425180638|4.0|I'll be the first to admit that it did take me a while to read this book.  Its the first book in the series that is written in first person present tense, which made it extremely difficult for me to read.  But once you get into the book its very good.  Cornwell masterfully takes a very open plot and draws it all together for a wonderful ending.  There are a few slow parts of character development and such, but it all comes together.  Another one of Cornwell's finest.
0684824906|4.0|Her thesis is that Lincoln's political success was in large part due to his great magnanimity, and she offers persuasive evidence of that point of view.  I was afraid the book would descend into psychobabble (of which Lincoln is too often a victim), but for the most part she sticks with concrete examples of his generosity and humility.    To be sure this is a character study and not a history.  Major war events are skimmed over or ignored.  That's an observation, not a criticism.      In terms of whether there is anything new here (besides emphasis), I think there is, especially some interesting newspaper accounts, diary entries, letters and memoirs dealing with the 1860 Republican Convention and Seward and Stanton.      This is a worthy effort that helps round Lincoln off.  But I credit his success more to a sharp intelligence, driving ambition (after the Nebraska Act), tremendous self-confidence and surpassing prose.

B000AGTPUU|1.0|SPOILER WARNING!    This is one of the most depressing Christmas stories I've ever seen.  I am not a better man for having watched it.  Next year, I'll skip it.    I don't mean anything against the intention.  You can have a great secular kids Christmas story (Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, The Year Without a Santa Claus, Santa Claus is Coming to Town among many others) unless you start toying with the \\"real\\" meaning of Christmas.  Take a secular Christmas story and throw in ideas of what we should believe and you are bound to miss the mark.  But this movie is not without its high points.    The best thing about the movie is the song \\"When Christmas Comes to Town.\\"  That just may be a classic.  Time will tell.    The artistry is spectacular but only in still shots.  The animation is robotic and mechanical.  Characters in \\"A Bugs Life\\" and \\"Toy Story\\" moved far more naturally.  You believed those characters were real.  In \\"The Polar Express\\" I could never get past the fact that the characters consisted of nothing but logic gates and software.  I had forgotten the picture came out only last year so I was surprised to find a 2004 copyright in the credits.  Given the inferior animation, I thought the movie was 5 or 6 years old.    But now we get to the meat of the matter--the story.  Robert Zemeckis seems to be trying to please as many people as possible by offending as few of them as possible (I never read the book but I hope it has more substance).  I could look past the bad acting via the C++ code if there was some substance to the story but ultimately it left me empty.  This is Christmas we're talking about!  Not \\"Political Correctness for Dummies!\\"    Three main characters are kids right around that age when they stop believing in Santa.  It isn't clear up front but later on we learn that the main character is the only one who truly doubts Santa.  The Lonely Boy character believes but is alienated.  He is possibly the most tragic character in the movie.  Christmas\\"just doesn't seem to work out\\" for him.  He is sad and poor and maybe a little bitter.  It's clear Christmas doesn't work out for him because he doesn't get much--if anything--for Christmas.  He wants something specific and always asks Santa for it but never gets it (he is certainly NOT spoiled, just poor).  The main character and the girl convince him to not give up hope and in the end he gets the material possession he always wanted.  His salvation is not in love but in stuff.  In the end, the commercialization of Christmas is his savior.  This left me feeling terribly empty.  No talk of family, friends, forgiveness, perhaps even something bigger than Santa--things that have profound TRUE meaning around Christmas.  He got his trinket and his soul was filled.  How sad!    The Hero/girl made decisions and got the group out of a few tight jams.  Great.  She deserves praise.  But when I think of the age old question, \\"What does Christmas mean to me?\\" The answer, \\"Leadership\\" never comes to mind.    And now the main character.  He doubts Santa.  He doesn't really believe anymore.  He's not in first grade anymore.  He's at the cusp.  He is growing up and needs to decide.  To believe or not to believe.    Believe in what?  Magic?  Santa?  Something more?  Something spiritual?  Christmas Spirit (whatever that means in this vanilla-plain-offend-no-one movie)?  In the end, he believes. . .in Santa.  Okay.  Fine.  Development is arrested for the time being.  hoo-ray.  Empty.    This movie didn't make me want to be a kid again.  It reminded me of my own doubts at that age and brought no satisfactory resolution.    I really wanted to like Polar Express.  But one of the more dreadful scenes involved the conductor saying, \\"What's important is to decide to get on the train, not where it's going.\\" (huh? What kind of message is that?)  And then there's the hobo riding on top of the train splatting as the train speeds into a tunnel (this is still a kids Christmas story, right?)The most enjoyable part of the movie was during what Amazon.com calls \\"The Nuremberg-like rally of frantic elves.\\"  This is when Santa makes his grand entrance.  A door opens.  His shadow is cast hundreds of feet in front of him across the sea of elves.  He is truly bigger than life.  You can't see him yet, only his gigantic shadow.  By that time, I was so disenchanted by the movie I turned to my girlfriend and said, \\"Maybe that's Godzilla and he'll jump out and torch the whole place.\\"  We laughed our butts off.    That would have been an appropriate ending.
055380457X|3.0|The writing style and pacing is terrible. I felt uncomfortable during the whole read. It amazes me that one of the authors is a pulitzer prize award winner and not a struggling college student.  <br /> <br />Other Problems: <br />1. The authors repeat themselves many times. They frequently forget they wrote about something a few chapters back. <br />2. It seems like they don't really uncover anything substantial that hasn't already been discussed in an online article. <br />3. They bring up the challenges Google currently faces, but don't supply any kind of opinion on the matters. They also do not do a good job of obtaining others' opinions. <br /> <br />If you want only one book about Google, save your money for \\"The Search\\" by John Battelle. While \\"The Search\\" doesn't focus exclusively on Google, it is a vastly superior book that covers just as much or more than \\"The Google Story\\".
0553588486|4.0|Martin's Game of Thrones is a refreshing and entertaining entry into the often cliched fantasy genre.  I really can't say enough about how awesome this book was.  Its fast paced with lots of action and intrigue.  The characters are exremely well thought out.  The good guys are extremely likable, and the baddies are insanely evil.  Martin keeps the suspense level high throughout the book as its apparent that anyone can die at almost anytime.  The world he creates has a certain medieval likeness about it but at the same time there are original places and history that will envelope you as you dive into the story.  At first its hard to keep track of who is who but an appendix and constant reminders through diaglogue help out.<br /><br />The only downside of the book is the structure of the chapters.  Martin frequently switches from character to character through short snippets of what is going on.  This works well most of the time but it can sometimes be a bit frustrating.  Also some of the over-the-top sexual customs of one of the foreign tribes is a bit much.<br /><br />This book is a great read for anyone who was bored by the Lord Of The Rings but wants to try something in the fantasy genre.  It's really only appropriate for 17 year olds and up as there is a decent amount of sex and cursing but this works to the books advantage without a doubt.  For those of us who grew up reading the Dragonlance Saga, there is a new amazing fantasy series out there its time to read.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  This is the most prominent fantasy series of the last five years amongst regular readers of sci fi/fantasy.  It's popularity is well deserved......
0553062182|2.0|I was recommended this book, but was severely disappointed. Ms. Aron does not discuss emotional sensitivity at any length and consistently rambles on about over arousal. While I have learned to deal with lights and sounds that bother me, I have not learned to deal with emotional sensitivity and this book did not help. The first few chapters are all nearly identitical, and Ms. Aron gives specific studies of her peers to describe what happened during early childhood to shape sensitive people. I am not interested in what happened in early childhood, I am interested in now, and what to do to make my life a little less emotionally charged. I have to give this book 2 stars because it is so boring and irritating that it is difficult to finish.

0553582461|5.0|Robin Hobb may not be as revolutionary as GRR and his followers in throwing the \\"good hero saves world from bad guy\\" quest novel out the window and breathing new life in a genre that had become repetitive to the point of boredom.  But she does something almost as miraculous.  She explores the complex bonds that flow between people who love each other deeply and the pain that love can cause in both its fullfillment and unfulfillment.  Don't get me wrong.  Its a great story with lots of intersting twists and turns, but what makes the story so much more than its plot are the agonizing choices the characters must make knowing that their loved ones are will never forgive their choices.     <br /> <br />While Martin explores the lust for power and the nature of good and evil, Hobb delves into the nature of love both romatic but more importantly plutonic love.

0385335482|1.0|I did force myself to finish the book, although it only took about 3 hours to read. Embarassingly enough, I asked for and received it for Christmas.  <br />I'm simply amazed at how not only did this book get good reviews and become a best seller, but it has a trail of sequels as well which are also popular. The main character, Becky, is so irritating, naive, idiotic, dull, and selfish I actually had to put the book down more than once and walk my annoyance off.  But all of the characters are two dimensional, her love interest Luke one second seems oblivious to fashion, and the next second is commenting on some woman's Prada shoes. One second he has a girlfriend, the next second she's gone and he's in love with Becky.  <br />I would complain more on the book's loose ends, inconsistencies, the shallowness, lack of any kind of wit or intelligence, but I've already wasted 3 hours on the book itself, and thats all I'm willing to give.
B00003CXAT|5.0|I've always pitied myself for never seeing \\"Jurassic Park\\", a film that many deem a must see. I've seen bits and pieces of the film but I'd never seen it in its entirety. Yesterday, my mom got me it (along with its two so called inferior sequels, which I've also never seen). Today, I watched it for the first time, and I loved it.<br /><br />The plot is simple enough. Paleontologists Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Ellie Statler (Laura Dern) have devoted to their lives to their career...and each other. Both have proved to be successful, and their research attracts the attention of Doctor John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), who offers them a trip to his dinosaur theme park, Jurassic Park. When they get there, they learn that Hammond has revived dinosaurs through DNA samples and is keeping on display for tourists. This does not sit well with obnoxious cohort Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum, who really steals the show), who questions the experiment. It soon turns out that Dr. Malcolm is right, as the dinosaurs wreak havoc on the park and turn the employees and other visitors (including Wayne Knight and Samuel L. Jackson) into walking Happy Meals.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg really outdid himself with this film. The special effects are amazing, and the dinosaurs are amazingly realistic. The performances are great (though Goldblum is the only one that is really of note). The special features are a bit lacking, but you cna overlook that since this film is truly a masterpiece.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This is a splendid album. I am a big fan of most Broadway musicals. Being a singer I get addicted to scores with good female parts. Let me just say to the sopranos out there, this CD is addicting! Having 2 female soprano leads is a little more than unusual for a Broadway musical. I sing the songs from this CD all the time!<br /><br />They have done the parts a great justice. Idina and Kristin are both superior vocalists and have a great blend with one another. And the principle male roles are all played by wonderful vocalists as well. I particularly like the voice of Fiyero and the diversity he shows between the lively \\"Dancing Through Life\\" versus the more serious \\"As Long As Your Mine.\\"  Boq also did a nice job and the Wizard was splendid at portraying the fatherly (but desirous of being thought of as \\"wonderful\\") old man he is.<br /><br />The songs are fun, witty, haunting, lively, and an utter delight to listen to! The CD gives enough of the story without ruining it for those who are waiting to see the production live on stage. The story really makes you think about the fine line between good and \\"Wicked\\" and should make you think twice about how you judge people! We all have a bit of Galinda and Elphaba in us...I hope you can find yours while listening to this CD.

B000B0WO0I|1.0|I was browsing through my local record store hoping to spend some Christmas cash, and I came accross this cd. I was so excited because my wife and I absolutely loved their last album, \\"Home\\". <br /> <br />So I picked it up right away (without listening to it)and noticed it had \\"simplified\\" or slightly stripped versions of several of their hits. Right away, I thought it would have the vintage vibe of the previous album. I took it home and popped it in the stereo, and I was HORRIFIED. The new versions of Red's older material were overproduced with new instrumentation, and the arrangements were NOT listener friendly. I went through every track on the cd and was completely dissappointed. I've always been a fan of Simply Red, but this was clearly packaged to make a few quick bucks. What a shame.....
B00063EMJ6|5.0|I've never been a huge Neil Young fan (my father despises him), but I've always enjoyed his music. I needed one Neil Young cd for my collection, but I couldn't find one.

Read on for the practically inevitable positives and negatives.<br /><br />Positives:<br />-This collection is perfect for those who only want one Neil Young album in their collection. It has almost all of his best known songs, including \\"Cowgirl In The Sand\\", \\"Cinnamon Girl\\", \\"After The Gold Rush\\", \\"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\\" (my personal favorite), \\"Like A Hurricane\\", \\"Hey Hey, My, My\\" (Into The Black)\\", \\"Harvest Moon\\", \\"Ohio\\", \\"The Needle & The Damge Done\\", \\"Heart Of The Gold\\" and \\"Rockin' In The Free World\\".<br />-Underrated masterpieces have been included as well.<br />-The remastering job is excellent.<br />-Affordable and easy to find.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />-Some underrated gems have been excluded, such as \\"Tell Me Why\\", \\"When You Dance I Can Really Love,\\" \\"Walk On\\", and \\"Four Strong Winds\\".<br />-Nothing from his Buffalo Springfield days, which means \\"For What It's Worth\\" is not included.<br />-Nothing past \\"Harvest Moon\\".<br />-No liner notes, just track information. I expected something a lot better.<br /><br />So, overall, this is an ideal Neil Young collection for beginners. Highly recommended.

0684824906|4.0|I like to think of myself as a student of history (one who devours the sprawling tomes about our founding fathers), but before reading Ms. Kearns' book, I knew precious little about President Lincoln and the Civil War period (other than the one dimensional narratives taught to us in high school).  Having immensely enjoyed Ms. Kearns' \\"No Ordinary Time,\\" and having long wanted to fill in my historical blank spot, I instantly purchased \\"Team of Rivals\\" after seeing it on display at the local Barnes and Noble.  And, since then, I have not experienced one moment of disappointment.  This elegant, yet daunting, book has been a wonderful companion, always beckoning me, luring me away from the attention of my three kids.  \\"Where's Daddy?\\" was a familiar refrain that I heard, as I huddled somewhere out of eyeshot, sneaking in a few pages at the most inappropriate times.  The book transported me to another time, yet the actors and institutions portrayed by Ms. Kearns appeared to me as strikingly contemporary.  The machinations of those seeking the 1860 Republican nominations reminded me of the strategizing depicted in Theordore White's reporting.  Just as modern day leaders must contend with competing political factions and the cachophony of the press, so did President Lincoln.  The ambitions, pettiness, and social demands of the 1860s play out daily in the Post's Style section.  The nuggets of political wisdom that are dispensed throughout \\"Team of Rivals\\" (including President Lincoln's observation that, in the United States, opposing a war is always tantamount to electoral suicide) apply with full force today.  How incongruous, how jarring, then, was it for me, the uninitiated reader, for what in many respects is a modern drama that unfolds against the anachronistic backdrop of slavery.  Ms. Kearns' book underscores the fallability of my presumption that, at some point, history becomes nothing but a stimulating curiosity, as opposed to a force that defines us, that still acts upon us and teaches us.  In reading \\"Team of Rivals,\\" my mind often wandered to 2005, filled with longing regret.  No reader of this book, however much he or she may be sympathetic to President Bush, can draw anything other than troubling inferences about today's administration.  The themes running throughout \\"Time of Rivals\\" are that a president's greatness, and his or her ability to successfully confront the challenges of his day, depend on not just steadfastness but also on a voracious intellectual appetite, a willingness to listen to and honor dissenting points of view, a confidence that allows voice to be given to political opponents, and decision-making that runs with, not against, the currents of popular sentiment.  These are all attributes that President Bush and his administration are said to sorely lack.  Given that we are now in a war, one that poses unique threats to our security, the thought that repeatedly crossed my mind as I read \\"Team of Rivals\\" was this:  We sorely lack a Lincoln for our times.  And I worry about the possible consequences of this singular deficiency.

B00005JO1Y|5.0|When I first heard that Peter Jackson had remake King Kong I first thought it was a mistake; would anyone be interested in seeing a remake of a remake?  But on seeing the film I think he has not only made a better King Kong but made one of the best films ever in its ability to tell a great story.      My reason for thinking this is how completely Mr. Jackson tells the story: there are no wasted minutes and each character is fully developed.  We now have a complete background on the struggling vaudevillian Anne Darrow and we more than understand Carl Denham's struggle to make his film and his unscrupulous character (with the fatal flaw of hubris).  Most of all, Kong comes fully to life as a character with as complex a life as any of the other characters.   The film also beautifully re-creates the New York of the early 1930's down to the seedy and dirty look of the Depression, and could Skull Island be more formidable?     Although this is a long film there is never a moment that I felt was pointless to building the story.  Peter Jackson also improves on the drama with the ship smashing into the rocks at Skull Island and the frightening natives that appear from nowhere.  The action sequences are well planned and are breathtaking to watch. The giant creatures on the island are truly frightening and the stampede of the brontosaurus-like animals is especially well done.  We also get a perspective on the hazards that Kong must face living on this island.   The relationship between Anne Darrow and Kong is build very well with her fear turning gradually into gratitude and, certainly, a love for this marvelous creature.  This is a different Kong, an older Kong, and all the credit is due to Andy Serkis's (who also made an interesting Lumpy) fine acting of the role: all of his preparation is up on the screen.      The casting of this film was perfect.  Jack Black makes an outstanding Carl Denham; we understand the ruthless side of his character but in the end, perhaps, he comes to an understanding, with his final line, that he has destroyed something that was purely wild.  This latter belief, that wild creatures would be destroyed by their association with civilization, was something that Kong creator Merrian C. Cooper believed.  Naomi Watts is a wonderful Anne Darrow and Andre Brody makes a resourceful Jack Driscoll, and Thomas Kretschmann (better known from The Pianist) makes a perfect captain of the Venture.   But it is Kong who is given a new life in this film and becomes the intelligent creature that a true gorilla is and for whom we have sympathy.  He is not simply the \\"brute\\" of the 1933 version but has the depth of character that he deserves.  If one does not find the ending of the film heartbreaking then you have a heart of stone. For me, Peter Jackson has outdone the 1933 film and the 1979 remake with his version of the story of King Kong. There are many complaints in the reviews about the length of the film. For me it was the quickest three hours I have spent, and the other people I saw the film with were similarly mesmerized.  A truly remarkable film.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|I've seen a lot of carping from many reviewers over the song selection for \\"Guns N' Roses - Greatest Hits\\". In some aspects, I agree with them. While this collection is basically made to include mostly all the hit singles and radio only hits, it surely couldn't have hurt to dig a little deeper into the GNR catlogue and include a few lesser known gems.<br /><br />Still, for someone like me who only wnats one Guns N' Roses album in their collection, this cd is ideal. This has all the songs that I'm familliar with, including \\"Welcome To The Jungle\\", \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\", Paradise City\\", \\"Knockin' On Heaven's Door\\" and \\"November Rain\\". There were also some songs I'd never heard before, such as \\"Civil War\\" and \\"Don't Cry Original\\", plus a few covers to throw a little diversity into the mix.<br /><br />The remastering job is excellent. The songs sound great. There are no liner notes, unfortunately. Still, this is a great cd to have in your collection.
B00005MAM2|3.0|The previous reviewer has said it all.  And I don't understand why it has become so famous.  I met some artists years ago in the Metro and they mentioned about Akira and how they liked it and inspired by it.  If you are in the Animation or Art field, you properly have heard of this.

B000AP04FG|2.0|Now, I am sure that I will be in the minority when saying this, but this movie is SO OVERRATED! And I mean VERY OVERRATED.  You would think that this movie would be a really great movie, not only because Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are in it, but it looked like an interesting story with material and substance that would be appropriate for these two actors of their caliber. This, however, is so wrong! First off, this film appeared to be that consisted of two, married couples trying to fight evil and other enemies, but it turns out that one spouse is just trying to kill the other?!!!! Then the fighting scenes in the middle of the movie where their characters are just fighting each other, slamming and punching each other all of the place like they would do a sworn enemy was so far from entertaining and nothing but silly and ridiculous. It turns out that these two are nothing but assassins. Seriously, you feel really stupid after watching this movie because you think that it's a good one worth viewing when it sure is not. So, please don't doubt me just because I might be one of the few to say this. The only reason this movie was such a hit was because Pitt and Jolie are famed and top-notch actors who happened to be romantically involved with each other in real life, which you know added to the whole appeal of the film. The only thing that this movie has to offer are two famous and really popular actors. Grade: D
0743454529|2.0|Initially I was gripped.  The central themes - genetic engineering, live organ transplants, the relative importance of healthy and sick humans, whether we should preserve life at all costs - are all important and urgent ones in our time, both as medical and ethical issues.  It's good to see them being tackled in fiction.  But the situations and the characters in this book became increasingly contrived and unlikely.  And the ending is just awful.  There was no reason for this particular twist, except perhaps that it let the author sidestep making any commitment about her own beliefs.  And disappointingly, the ending means that both sisters lost out - neither of them, finally, had their wishes respected.  Had the plot been allowed to play out as it should have, with Anna making her own final medical choice, the author might have alienated many readers - whichever choice Anna might have made, many readers would have been very upset by that choice. Inevitable, given the controversial nature of the issues at stake.  But at least there would have been integrity to the story.  Alas, the ending that was chosen cheated the plot. <br /> <br />Having each chapter narrated by a different character in the story probably also hindered development of three-dimensionality of any of them, particularly when the same prominence was given to what were really support characters (the lawyer, the guardian) as to the family.  The book started with Anna's voice and would have been stronger if it had stayed with Anna's voice.  And as another reviewer has commented, the different type face for different chapters is so gimmicky: what is the point? <br /> <br />At book's end, I felt like it was written specifically with the hope of becoming a TV prime-time tear-jerking soap.  It's a script or plot outline, not a serious piece of fiction.  It's the first book by this author I have read and I won't be a hurry to read another one.

B00011RPB0|2.0|Boring.  what else can I say?  I used to travel alone alot but I can't connect myself to this film.  Will I share a bed with a stranger?  No. Not even my close friends under any normal circumstances (seriously).  There are so many things to do, to see, and to film in Tokyo; and I don't understand why the director, Sophia Coppola, picked a hospital and made fun of the people there.  Just plain boring.  But I find the Karaoke scene interesting because this is really part of the Japanese culture and that storyline should be developed more.  Afterall, it'd better to have more communications among the characters in the film.
0393317552|4.0|Diamond begins by describing a question asked of him by a friend, who wondered from whence come economic disparities among the nations of the world.  This book is Diamond's attempt to answer his friend's question.   <br /> <br />Jared Diamond's thesis is that the technological and economic status of societies today is a function of their geographical history, and not the result of differences between various peoples with regard to innate ability or intelligence.  According to Diamond the major points are: <br />1. Technologically advanced civilizations could not form in hunter-gatherer societies for the simple reason that innovation requires a certain amount of free time, which is made available (at least to a privileged class) in agrarian cultures, and is rare to non-existent among hunter-gatherers. <br />2. The ability to form an agrarian culture depends largely upon the availability of animals and plants suitable for domestication.  There are great differences among geological areas with regard to the available plants and animals that are suitable for domestication, with the Fertile Crescent being among the most endowed.   Other characteristics making the Fertile Crescent ideal include a long east-west axis and a Mediterranean climate.  <br /> <br />The availability of plants and animals suitable for domestication provided the launching pad for civilizations to grow, and their advantages multiplied.  The agrarian culture gave rise to a privileged class that had the time and resources to spend intellectual capital inventing new machines and technologies.  These societies also led to dense populations, which led to the evolution of diseases that were fatal to hunter-gatherers when they made their first contact with Europeans (witness the deaths of millions of Native Americans due to smallpox and other diseases brought over from Europe).  The twin benefits of technologies such as guns and steel, along with germs proved to be an insurmountable advantage over which hunter-gatherer societies across the world crumbled. <br /> <br />Diamond's motivation is clearly driven (at least in part) by a desire to refute racists who argue that differences in wealth and technology among various peoples is a consequence of differences in intelligence.  Diamond argues that effects attributable to natural surroundings alone are sufficient to account for such disparities, and he considers racist explanations offensive.  For example, on page 19 Diamond says: <br /> <br />\\"The objection to such racist explanations is not just that they are loathsome, but also that they are wrong.  Sound evidence for the existence of human differences in intelligence that parallel human differences in technology is lacking.\\" <br /> <br />Diamond is an enthusiastic contributor in the war against racism, but this revolution, like all others, has its excesses.  While the current revolution eschews racism against people of color, it has no compunction against making negative racist generalizations regarding whites, and white men in particular.  Consider the fact that, just after making his assertion that racist explanations are \\"loathsome,\\" Diamond utters this absurdity\\" <br /> <br />\\"In fact, as I shall explain in a moment, modern \\"Stone Age\\" peoples are on the average probably more intelligent, not less intelligent, than industrialized peoples.\\" [page 19] <br /> <br />Diamond's racism is both morally disappointing and factually incorrect.  He justifies his assertion about less intelligent industrialized peoples with arguments to the effect that watching too much television (among other things) lowers the IQ of youth in industrialized societies.  His argument is ad hoc to the core and factually incorrect.  Using Diamond's line of reasoning, IQ trends in industrialized countries should be declining, but they are, fact, increasing.  Scientists even have a name for this trend, it's called the Flynn effect, and it amounts to an increase in IQ of about 3 points per decade.<br /> <br />Though the cause of the Flynn effect is not fully understood, and many explanations are controversial, Diamond's explanation for why the trend should be going the opposite direction is unpersuasive and incomplete at best.  Making matters worse is the fact that Diamond's display of racism comes at the very beginning of the book - leaving the reader wondering what other persuasive-sounding arguments in the book are as fatally flawed.   <br /> <br />Over all I believe that Diamond has provided a convincing argument explaining why civilizations arose at different times in different places across the globe.  But there are times when his exclusive focus on geographical issues seemed overbearing.  For example, he barely mentions possible influences caused by different types of governments.  Are some better than others?  Similarly, he largely ignores cultural effects, but is it possible that some cultures foster inquiry, thrift, industriousness, and curiosity more than others?  Religion is yet another unexplored dimension.  Are some religions (or none at all) more conducive to the development of advanced civilizations that others? <br /> <br />Diamond seems to be aware of these missing dimensions, as he touches on them briefly in the epilog and afterword.  But these comments seem half hearted and designed mostly to broaden his readership by convincing business leaders that \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" describes broad principles that can be used to run a successful company. <br /> <br />I should be cautious with my criticism, though.  This is a long book about a complex subject that, no doubt, excites a lot of emotional responses.  While Diamond clearly brings his biases, don't we all?  Diamond, at least, has made a concerted, logical, and in-depth attempt at explaining some very important aspects of the development of human civilizations.  The book is full of fascinating insights into the seemingly minor differences that undoubtedly contributed significantly to the disparate trajectories of various societies, resulting in the gulfs that separate them today.  Hats off for a wonderful book that was a pleasure to read, and really made me sit up and think.
0060899190|1.0|I bought this book on Amazon as a gift, but now that I've gotten to see it, I'm not sure I can give it. I understand other commenters' criticism of the layout. I am no master of design, but certain things stick out as very carelessly detrimental to the simple enjoyment of reading the book. Sometimes a horizontal postcard is spread largely across two pages, with much of the middle stuck somewhere in the book's spine. Other horizontal postcard are merely turned sideways to fill a page. Much more pleasing are the pages with two horizontal postcards; you don't have to keep turning the book back and forth just to read the page. None of these postcards is like the other, so a more uniform presentation might have presented an easier way to read the postcards with less stress for the reader.
0060764899|4.0|The story, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, features four children displaced from their home in London due to violence of WWII to a remote country cottage. Upon arriving to their caretaker's cottage they explored the odd rooms and furniture. To eliminate their boredom, they decided to play hide-and-go-seed. This is when the youngest, Lucy, hides in the wardrobe and stumbles across the land called Narnia. The snowy land of Narnia is filled with all types of little creatures like fauns, dwarfs, and beavers, but the land of Narnia also has one White Witch, who calls herself the Queen of Narnia.  <br /> <br /> The four children don't realize that they are the ones who can stop the White Witch and save Narnia from the Winter Wonderland that the witch has cast upon it. With the help of a lion named Aslan they over throw the witch and Narnia has all different seasons all over again. All of the animals live in peace and harmony after the reign of the White Witch is over. <br /> This story is written for one who enjoys adventure and likes to have fun. On a scale from 1-5 I would rate it a 4 because it's one of those books that you can't put down once you start to read it. It's a children's book even though some adults enjoy reading it.  <br />
B000BO0LKY|4.0|All of you haters need to get a life.  So what if Mariah wants to release this CD for the third time or even for the 10th time.  I mean artists rerelease albums all the time.  This CD adds 4 great new tracks but leaves Sprung and Secret Love off, a bad move on Island's part.  However, if you don't currently own this CD, then this is the version to own. <br /> <br />I really think that kid's should be banned from reviews.  I mean what does her weight have to do with the quality of an album review.  These reviews should be from people who actually have heard the CD.  How fat she is or how much she eats has nothing to do with it.  Period. <br /> <br />

B000002UJQ|5.0|Holy Cow MTV Supporter.  I guess all books need to have colorful pictures of Spot running, all artists drawings needn't be colored outside the lines, and all movies must have the bad guys caught in the end.

1400031087|1.0|I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO DESCRIBE HOW BAD THIS BOOK IS. IT DOES NOT COME ANYWHERE NEAR TO BEING A MEMIOR, AS IT IS PURE FICTION.  THE AIRPLANE, THE DENTIST, THE COUNSELOR DRIVING A PATIENT TO A CRACKHOUSE, THE CLICHED CHARACTERS THAT ARE EMPLOYED BY THE AUTHOR TO VALIDATE HIS \\"MANHOOD\\"...THE LIST GOES ON-IT'S ALL GARBAGE.  THERE IS NO WAY ANY OF THE THINGS THE AUTHOR CLAIMS IN THIS BOOK COULD HAVE HAPPENED-THINGS JUST DON'T WORK THAT WAY. <br /> <br />THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE WRITTEN RAVE REVIEWS ARE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH THE SUBJECT MATTER, OR ARE WORKING FOR FREY'S PUBLISHER OR SOMETHING.( A LOT OF THE GLOWING REVIEWS SEEM VERY GENERIC, AND SEEM TO REPEAT THEMSELVES-HOW ODD.) THERE IS NO WAY SOMEONE WHO HAS ACTUALLY BEEN THROUGH ADDICTION AND REHAB WOULD BELIEVE THIS PIECE OF TRASH.  PLEASE DON'T READ THIS BOOK AND THINK IT PORTRAYS THE TRUTH.  IT IS THE WORK OF AN UNTALENTED, UNCONSCIONABLE WRITTER. <br />FREY HAS DONE A GRAVE DISSERVICE TO THE RECOVERING COMMUNITY, AND UNDOUBTEDLY DISCOURAGED SOMEONE WHO NEEDS IT, FROM GETTING HELP. <br />OPRAH ROYALLY FAILEDON THIS SELECTION.
B0006L16N8|5.0|In my opinion, Rush of Blood to the Head is their best album, people had really high expectations for this cd, as did I.  Upon first listen I thought it was pretty good, but sunk in after 3 or 4 listens, becoming one of my favorite releases for any genre this year.  Coldplay has a weird appeal about them that can attract fans from different musical backgrounds which is hard to do these days without sounding forced.  The lyrics are from the heart and the music is put together very well. The last song Kingdom Come was a really great bonus, you could definitely feel the Johnny Cash vibe.  Anyone who appreciates good music should own this cd.
0062502182|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this book.  I was pleasently surprised.  It's a very quick read that makes you feel really good about life.
0446677450|1.0|There is no real substance in this book.  It leaves you wanting more information and more answers.  I think this book is con to get you to buy a $350 board game and more of his books.  Just take a look at all the \\"wonderful\\" items you could buy on-line on the last pages of the book.  In his book, Kiyosaki advised \\"paying professionals well\\".  I wonder if Kiyosaki is one of these professionals who deserves to be paid well.  All in all, I think the empty meanings found in this book are used as bait to generate consumers of more of Kiyosaki merchandise.
B000B19BCG|5.0|I first noticed Supergrass with their \\"We Are Young\\" video tagged onto the end of the Clueless DVD. Seeing them at The Fillmore in 1997 made me a dedicated fan. But their last release, Life On Other Planets, while still catchy and fun, left me thinking the band was about out of steam and creativity - it also left me wondering if I hadn't put on Electric Warrior by mistake.  <br />I gave my wife Road as a sure-fire Christmas present, expecting good and catchy tunes that were more of the same, but I was blown away when she put it on. Road to Rouen is an album of vibrant color and depth that also captures the energy and buoyancy of the Supergrass we all know and love. Their best since In It For The Money, if not their best - period.  And no, the sound is not the same as the raw hormonal exuberance of I Should Coco, just as Revolver wasn't Please Please Me. A great, fully realized album that leaves me eager to find out what they will create next.  <br />
B00000K3D4|5.0|It's been a while since I saw this so I decided to sit down and watch it again.  Of course, I knew it was good, but I'd forgotten how good.  As a story, it's fun and entertaining, very otherwordly, vivid and well-executed.  But what really sets it apart is the imagination that went into it, from the writing and direction to the amazing puppetry. <br /> <br />I hate actually using the word \\"puppets\\".  It's not strong enough for what Henson does here.  These are fully realized, fully living characters.  The scene where the goblin king dances and sings in his castle is just so full of life it's easy to forget that these are just dolls without the brilliant puppeteers pulling their strings. <br /> <br />As for the story, it's fun.  A subtle coming of age journey tempered with genuinely touching moments and inspired side treks into high silliness.  The acting, both human and puppet, is great. <br /> <br />This film is terrific and just gets better with age.  Great for kids.  Great for adults.  Rightly deserving of the title:  MASTERPIECE.
B000059Z8J|3.0|I was very disappointed in this film experience.  The start is slowed down by way too many details about Krypton's governmental system - you get 25 minutes of Jor-el's debate with other literal luminaries in their silly aluminum-foil costumes - and then a bunch of scenes to define superman's character while a boy (most of these are part of the \\"director's cut\\" which while fun can also be a bore).  So the action doesn't begin until about an hour into the film, and my kids had long gotten bored by it and wandered out of the room (and I got it for them).  Even for me, a hard lover of sci-fi, it was boring - so I must warn watchers who are not committed, uncritical fans:  you will probably not enjoy this part.  It is just plain too slow, even static, which means this part is poorly edited.<br /><br />Once the action starts, the film becomes pretty good.  You see pre-computer age effects to show what it wd be like for a man to fly, etc., and you can always enjoy the difference.  While they are limited to pretty silly caricatures, there is no question that the actors are good, expecially the young Reeve in the role that made him a star.  Kidder is also good, in her stunningly beautiful prime, as is Hackman.<br /><br />But we are used to kid-adult films that have become much better than this, like Spiderman, Harry Potter or the Star Wars series.  They speak to both groups of watchers with richer characters, more complex and engaging plots, and slicker effects (that last is not necessarily an asset as you can always recognize computer-generated images).  As such, Superman looks like a prototype for far far better films of the genre.  Indeed, I was surprised at how disappointed I was by the film - and my kids voted with their feet.  I didn't even find the camp aspect funny enough to make me laugh.<br /><br />Tepidly recommended.
B000002KKC|3.0|... given Fleetwood Mac's mega-success with \\"Rumours,\\" their supergroup status, broad appeal, double album venture, comparisons to Beatles \\"White Album,\\" etc. etc... You've probably already read all about that.    Bottom line is, many tracks sound unfinished, like demos with the rhythm section plodding along and along.  There are many good ideas in the songs, but they probably could have used some tinkering and mixing around.  If they compressed the sounds of this album into 11 tracks instead of 20, taking musical elements from most songs and combining them into a manageable number of tracks, then this would have been an excellent album on par with Rumours - but the group decided to put nothing to the cutting board and not to refine many songs (\\"Save Me a Place,\\" anyone?).  There are some great singles on this album though - \\"Sisters of the Moon,\\" \\"Sara,\\" Tusk\\" being the best.    This all being said, this is not a boring album.  You have three talented songwriters - Buckingham, Nicks, McVie - each with a different musical style.  There are too many tracks to digest, so you'll always discover something new with each listen.
B00000G3AZ|3.0|The movie itself is lovely, lighthearted and happy, and has been reviewed in painstaking detail by other readers. I'd give it four or five stars, considering how much we enjoyed it. But I was very disappointed by the DVD edition. Not only does it come without any special features, it comes with no alternative soundtracks, and not even subtitles in other languages. Not all our friends/family understand English so well as to follow Jane Austen without subtitles - thus we cannot share this movie with them. It's as if the producers put as little effort as they could and just pushed this one out. There are no other versions I know of. <br /> <br />Perhaps we should have taken the hint from the blurb on the back  of the box, which does nothing else but compare the movie with \\"the hit movie Clueless\\"? Yep. Clueless. It sorts of gives you an idea of the thought that was put in this DVD...
0060763280|4.0|If i had a penny for every time Eker promotes his seminars in this book... I'd be a millionaire. Also be warned, this book is very amateurishly written. I wouldn't be surprised if he wrote it in about a two week period. Also, the tone of the book is somewhat reminiscent of your uncle that takes you by the shoulder in a family dinner and gives you tidbits on life. Nonetheless, I decided to give this book 4 stars because these tidbits are pretty damn important + interesting, and i think deep down this author has a good and positive heart. although, again, i think he really \\"cheapens\\" his book by his needy incessant promotions of his seminars.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|First, let me preface this review by saying I am NOT a SciFi fan AT ALL - I've never seen the entire Star Wars trilogy, I hate Star Trek, I don't watch any SciFi movies or shows.  I reluctantly agreed to give this series a try and I must say I was PLEASANTLY surprised!!  My husband was in the midst of getting absolutely hooked - and I sooned joined in, too!  This show is funny, intelligent -- the characters are fascinating, the action scenes are exciting.  Firefly had me hanging on the edge of my seat - wanting to watch the next episode - just like I am with the Lost series.  You don't have to be a SciFi fan to like this show / DVD set.  It is a fantastically written show that anyone will enjoy - it just happens to be set in space.
B000002GJH|3.0|\\"Hunger Strike\\" and \\"Say Hello 2 Heaven,\\" the two singles of this album, are still the best songs.  \\"Reach Down\\" is the song nestled between these two singles and runs 11:11 long - it's a good jam though.  \\"Wooden Jesus\\" is decent too, but most of the other songs are too long.  They're basically extended jams.  There is also something about Chris Cornell's voice that gets tiring after a while.  What can I say, the album is OK as a whole - it's not annoying, and you should take to it well if you like Soundgarden or Pearl Jam - but not too many of the songs have stuck with me.
0307276902|5.0|This is a brutally detailed account of what life is like for an addict, and the difficulties of recovery.  After reading this book, it would be impossible for anyone to glamorize drugs or alcohol. The writer doesn't ask for your sympathy.  Nor does he victimize himself.  He acknowledges his own responsibility for the choices he made that devastated those closest to him, as well as his self-destructive actions, and likewise, takes responsibility for staying sober.  Don't be fooled by the book jacket.  There is nothing light-hearted or glib about this saga.  It will take hold of you and you will not be able to forget the agony and despair of addiction.<br />The minor parts of the book that were embellished should not deter anyone from recognizing the agony of addiction and the truth of its message.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|By now everyone knows the basic premise: Oh Dae-su, an ordinary businessman, is imprisoned for 15 years by unseen jailers, a TV his only companion. His wife is killed, he goes slowly mad, and finally resolves to escape, honing his body and mind. When he is on the verge of breaking out of his cell, he is mysteriously released. He immediately starts to seek out his kidnapper, a quest for vengeance which leads him to the unspeakable reason for his imprisonment.    It's hard to say anything meaningful about this movie. It is by turns brutal, tender, violent, heartbreaking, baffling, disgusting, and hilarious, but these are mere adjectives. Its impact is so direct and visceral as to render further discussion superfluous; each image will sear itself into the memory for a long time. It is one of a very few movies that attain the depth and mythic power of Greek tragedy (Vertigo being the only other example I can think of), yet it's totally pulpy and modern. By the final shot of Oh Dae-su's vacant, hapless smile, I felt almost as if I had been physically violated, yet I was utterly spellbound. Oldboy is not ennobling, it doesn't preach a message, you won't feel a better human being for having seen it; it just must be experienced.
B000683VI4|4.0|\\"The Notebook\\" wasn't what I thought it would be like. For so long I have heard that it was the best most wonderful (chick flick) ever made. I haven't seen it merely because, I wasn't too interested. I finally watched it. It was good and it did make me cry. (Of course I cry during every movie.) And it reminded me a little bit like \\"Random Harvest\\" (I think \\"Random Harvest\\" is way better though).<br /><br />The thing that got me is that they are too physical. I mean in almost every scene they are making out or doing something rated \\"PG-13\\". I dunno I found that extremely stupid and wondered if their screenwriters just didn't want to make up any dialogue so just made them make-out. I mean in older movies they didn't eat each others' faces and yet \\"Casablanca\\" is the most romantic movie of all time (atleast said by AFI). Maybe because in the older movies they are adults and in this movie they are more like teenagers.<br /><br />I also though the story line was just not that believable. Sure a summer of love can be remembered for a life time but, really can it last for a whole lifetime, especially after you haven't seen that person in 7 years? And I think the ending was wrapped up too short. She came back all of a sudden. I was expecting her to atleast get down the aisle with that other guy and then realize you know she loved Noah. Oh and yeah what about the whole mom thing and her love affair? That was so predictable. Maybe I'm just being a little cynical. I liked the current time scenes much better than the flash back scenes.<br /><br />Wow, I'm being much more harsh on this film than I thought. The current time scenes I guess redeemed the other parts. It's touching that Noah stays with her while she has dementia. Also their one scene when she suddenly remembers and begins to dance with him was so touching and moved me to tears. (James Garner still has got it!!! But of course! He worked with Audrey Hepburn and Doris Day!) I think that James Garner is truly the star of the movie and without him or Gena Rowlands it wouldn't have made it.without him or Gena Rowlands it wouldn't have made it. <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I might actually watch TV once in a while if there were more shows like this. <br /> <br />I saw the pilot episode of this on the Sci Fi channel and immediately went out and purchased the DVD.  Now I understand why a DVD TV series that was released in 2002 is sitting up at #3 on the Top Sellers list in the waning days of 2005.  This is just really great acting, writing, directing, music, and everything. <br /> <br />It's an accidental conglomeration of wildly different characters,  brought together by fate and bound by love, hate, honor, and betrayal.  The interactions and frictions between the characters helps to drive each episode in new and unexpected directions.  Through the 13 meaty 40+ minute episodes and hour-long pilot (well worth the price of this set), you will meet each of the 9 central characters and grow quickly to know them.  Many you will love, some you will hate, some you will hate to love, and others you will love to - well, you get the idea. <br /> <br />Many memorable lines and moments will grab you as you take in the entire series.  I personally had a hard time putting it down once I started.  I recommend beginning your viewing early on a Saturday, in case you get hooked like I did.  Going to work the next day with only four episodes under my belt, knowing there were so many more yet to see was near torture.  As soon as I finished watching, I started them all over again. <br /> <br />I am not quite sure what Fox was thinking, or any network for that matter.  I guess there isn't much room on TV for witty writing, heartwarming characters, exciting action, and clever plots.  Since there isn't, I guess we can say thank god for DVDs, and thank god for the internet so we can find out about gems like this that might have otherwise have been missed. <br /> <br />I know it's weird, but I actually think my life has been enriched for having seen that someone out there is making material with this much heart.  The entire series was some of the best guilt-free entertainment I have had in years, and my only problem with it is that there aren't 100 more episodes. <br /> <br />Rent it first if you're not sure this is right for you, but whatever you do, give this series a chance.  This is not something I would have normally picked up on my own, and I am so glad I stumbled across it.  Thrilling adventures, clever story lines, witty dialogue, and the best gorram TV show nobody ever saw (although with DVD sales the way they are, perhaps that's not exactly true anymore!). <br /> <br />If you happen to like this and you're hungry for more, check out Serenity.  It's a Big Damn Movie that takes these same characters on a silver screen adventure (hopefully not the last!) which takes place after the events in the series, which only got made apparently because this DVD sold so well.  It's a must-have for any fans of this series.
1565847032|4.0|The sun shines, planets orbit, corporations lie voraciously, humans consume mindlessly and Noam Chomsky - the pre-eminent intellectual of the modern era - churns out knowledge, elucidates the times and refutes the notion that it is our manifest destiny to perpetually suffer indignity.<br />In a wide-ranging series of question and answer sessions Chomsky tackles a myriad of seemingly disparate topics, which ultimately pertain to and concern the economic and political system and the welfare of humanity. Unlike books authored by Chomsky himself which tackle specific topics Understanding Power - The Indispensable Chomsky is the transcript of sessions traversing a decade during which Chomsky takes questions from the audience on a number of topics ranging from US foreign policy, imperialism, trade and the third world to propaganda, corporate media, solutions to the collective malaise and the march towards a more just system and society. Expounding on his legendary encyclopaedic knowledge and command of logic, Professor Chomsky manages to offer the questioners, and by extension the readers, a radical approach distinct from the boilerplate and mind-numbing discussions of the corporate media. Refuting the suitability of handling our problems by working within the system and nibbling at the edges Chomsky offers an alternative to the broken system without resorting to the expected customary answers like a broken record.<br />As thoughtful and brilliant as the discourse is, the book's editors also deserve much praise not only for the compilation, but also for the easy to read format and the lively pace of the book. Understanding Power could easily have been entitled Understanding The System and is a brilliant book based on the profound teachings of a brilliant thinker.
1592400876|5.0|This marvellous book is both instructive and vastly entertaining.<br /><br />There are too many pedantic books out there on the English language, and they are the cause of our current malaise.  This book shows that the English language can still be made enjoyable.  It's not only correct, but the author gets her points across in such a winsome way that the reader is charmed.<br /><br />I found myself laughing out loud in several places, which is not something that one normally does when reading a book about grammar.<br /><br />I am a professional writer, and I highly recommend this book.  It should be mandatory reading in all high schools and colleges.
B000B8QEYC|4.0|Enya has made a world-wide name for herself by transforming the simple ambience of synthesized instrumental and vocal sound into harmonized Nirvana for several years now. \\"Amarantine\\" offers the familiar Enya sound, with some new exploration in the realm of the melodical and lyrical. As always, she continues to profess her love for all things aquatic in nature with such tracks as \\"It's in the rain\\", \\"The river sings\\" (a strange turn in arrangement for Enya, which elicits visions of an efficacious war dance), \\"Drifting\\", and \\"Water shows the hidden heart\\" - these acoustically pleasing tracks prolong the tradition she has followed. Enya vocalizes in the same etheral style that has made her a signature performer, and does so in more English than she has ever done on an album; and here is the rub. Enya's style is far too suited for the hauntingly beautiful and elvin Gaelic language she normally adapts to her music. Her English lyrics are at times monotonous, whining, and lacking in substance. Occasionally, she uses the \\"Loxian\\" language in her music, which is adapted from the book \\"Water Shows the Hidden Heart\\" by Roma Ryan - although intangible, it is still pleasing to the ear. Overall, \\"Amarantine\\" is a nice return for Enya, and an above average effort from the artist.
015626224X|2.0|Having read this book as a teenager, I always felt that this was an insult to people truly trapped in poverty. Orwell \\"allowed\\" himself to be poor, but the people around him didn't have such a choice. My grandparents struggled with want, and worked hard to give their children a better life. They would have been appalled at someone who could do better, but chose to be trapped in the underclass, even if it wasn't permanent.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|For those of us who loved the TV series Firefly, this movie provides the raison d'etre for River. In the series she was just an annoying child and the sacrifices made by the others on her behalf seemed irrational. The movie finally tells us her story and does a superb job of tying up all the loose ends.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|When it comes to Bruce's music, you either \\"get it\\" or you don't. For anyone that doesn't get it or gave this new release a one or two star rating, I can only assume you aren't a Springsteen fan and don't know the significance of Born to Run. This 30th anniversary edition is wonderful. For anyone who has followed Bruce through the years, it's interesting to see him examine his music in \\"Wings for Wheels.\\" The Hammersmith Odeon concert is unreal. This is a young Bruce, not yet 30, singing and performing his heart out, like he always does. Not everyone sounds good in concert. Bruce does. If you love the cookie cutter pop stars of today and your idea of music is some choreographed, lip-syncing teen star, you might not like this. If you like great music with a message, you will love this I think. It's definitely worth the money.
B000002TWN|5.0|This Disc has it all. Jazz, R&B, Neo-Soul, Gospel, Blues, etc. It's an owe to greats and whose the best: Marvin Gaye, Prince, Donny Hathaway, Miles Davis, Charlie Parker, Aretha Franklin, Sarah Vaughn, Quincy Jones, Billie Holiday, Duke Ellington, Stevie Wonder, so and and on. <br /> <br />Just to say, I'm proud I have this luckily I do. D'Angelo is real strong, so versatile, kinda like a Mount Rushmore or a post-modern Ray Charles, Quincy Jones, Sam Cooke, R. Kelly, to name a few. He has it all. He can play, he can sing, he can write, he can arrange, he can produce, he can compose, he could do everything.  <br /> <br />I'm happy alot of reviews had to rate it a CLASSIC RATING and mostly an A+ Must-Have. Bought to get into VOODOO in a lil bit.  <br /> <br />Love every song on this disc. Don't forget about the remake of Smokey Robinson's \\"Cruisin\\" (which was 1 of my favorite off the album have a real tight groove and lovely strings and cool vocals) Plus I love Brown Sugar (that's everybody's song, mine too), Lady, the big-band jazz influenced \\"When We Get By\\", the controversial song \\"S***, Damn, Motherf*****\\", the Gospel-coming anointed \\"Higher\\" (the last track off the CD), \\"Me and Those Dreamin' Eyes of Mine\\" (ev'rytime I hear that song and plus the video, it reminds me of listening to some Ronny Jordan plus some 70s soul and some smooth jazz, 'cuz it has that vibe, that smooth feeling, that sexy more mature voice with a great falsetto on the add), to me if I was the black version of David Ritz, Leonard Feather, Gary Giddins, Gene Lees, or the Modern Quincy Jones, R. Kelly, Marvin Gaye, Ray Charles, Sam Cooke, Grover Washington, I'm the one that can make songs outta that. Ya'll know I actually play the trumpet, write music, make songs (whether singing or rapping), plus create a Wide collection of Diverse Albums of Jazz, Rock, Classical, Rhythm-and-Blues, Gospel, Easy-Listening, Pop, Rap, Hip-Hop, Christian Rap, etc. I love all music, I hear all music, I appreciate all music, I know all music. I got Music all'a my Blood, my Heart, My Spirit, My Daily Snacktime, My Daily Homework, etc. You know what I mean. <br /> <br />Again this was released in 1994-1995. This became the birth of the music they call \\"neo-soul\\" or \\"nu-soul\\" they call it. That brought in a new generation, a very variety of artists who create a melange of different sorts of music [Jazz, Hip-Hop, Contemporary Jazz, R&B, 60s & 70s Soul, Gospel, Blues, Latin, etc.]. Erykah Badu, Maxwell, Musiq (Soulchild), Jill Scott, Lauryn Hill, Alicia Keys, India.Arie, Glenn Lewis, Groove Theory, Ronny Jordan, Digable Planets, Kindred, Anthony Hamilton, Bilal, etc. (that's in the Neo-Soul Genre) plus in the Gospel Neo-Soul Genre they are Debra Killings, Lisa McClendon, Joye B. Moore, Tonex, Kirk Whalum, Lisa Perry, Montrell Darrett, Deitrick Haddon, etc. <br /> <br />
B00005JO1Y|1.0|I was prepared for this to be lousy and it was. But I didn't expect it<br /><br />to be lousier by far even than the Dino De Laurentis Opus of 1976.<br /><br />I'm convinced Academy Award Winner Peter Jackson can't really direct at<br /><br />all. Lord of the Rings was wooden, empty, barely plotted and inhuman.<br /><br />All the Ring's backgrounds were phony Computer Matte and they sucked<br /><br />and made the story look like a cartoon. It didn't help that he reduced<br /><br />his Rings characters to cartoons too.<br /><br />The same problem exists in King Kong. The actors don't have a thing to<br /><br />do with one another. They act in a vacuum, as if they're not sharing<br /><br />the same movie.<br /><br />The new version was supposed to be a paean to the original 1933 Kong.<br /><br />It is set in the thirties. The computer matted skull island sketches<br /><br />wouldn't convince an eight year old. They stink. Then there are the<br /><br />jurassic park-like dinosaurs. This section is so phony, they would have<br /><br />improved the movie by simply cutting every bit of it out. The Kong<br /><br />figure is not great, nor even as moving as the 1933 Ape, but the<br /><br />Gorilla is so much more realistic than the dinosaur figures he fights<br /><br />that they have no business being in the same fight with him.<br /><br />A good Kong will have a human response to the Fay Wray character, but<br /><br />that is never managed. Kong the character is awful. A permanent exile<br /><br />to New Zealand for Jackson is called for here.<br /><br />Seventeen members of the Venture crew who look for an eighth wonder of<br /><br />the World on Skull Island die. Two of them include a black guy who<br /><br />looks like the late Jackie Robinson and a white kid, who is reading<br /><br />Heart of Darkness in preparation for the assault on the island. The<br /><br />reading and the relationship of these two characters is supposed to<br /><br />undercut the extraordinary racism of King Kong. All the Kong movies<br /><br />borrow from Heart of Darkness and its aura of Black Voodoo and racism.<br /><br />The black guy is killed by Kong, and the kid too. It doesn't matter<br /><br />that they are, because the strange friendship between these two is<br /><br />finally meaningless.<br /><br />The screenplay, co-written by director Jackson, is not careful about<br /><br />details and story points. For that failure alone, King Kong is a ruin.<br /><br />At one point a bunch of aimless dinosaurus are stomping through the<br /><br />crew members of the Venture, even stepping past them, but never killing<br /><br />any of the principals. Its as if they're not really chasing them at all<br /><br />after awhile, just stampeding downhill WITH them, due to the steepness<br /><br />of the mountain.<br /><br />The blacks on Skull Island are carefully coiffed, corked and painted<br /><br />with varieties of appliances and makeup never seen before on any black<br /><br />from Africa or the US. This is a gesture of political correctness: If<br /><br />they look nothing like American or African blacks there can be no race<br /><br />issue, right?<br /><br />Later, when Kong is performing on Broadway, a typical set of American<br /><br />Blacks do the usual Jungle Movie mumbo-jumbo around Kong and the girl<br /><br />they've gotten to replace Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts). Watts is wasted in<br /><br />this film. She is one of the best actresses working, but the only real<br /><br />acting she manages is early on, on stage, as a member of a fading<br /><br />vaudeville group.<br /><br />The Depression scenes in Thirties Times Square are mostly fake computer<br /><br />stuff that the real actors walk around in. The differences in film<br /><br />stock are obvious to the audience. Like Anthony Quinn, the bedouin king<br /><br />of Lawrence of Arabia, the audience looks in vain for something<br /><br />authentic. I notice the thirties computerized New York stuffis based<br /><br />on Norman Rockwell paintings and famous Life and Look Magazine photos<br /><br />of the period. Its just terribly obvious. The art direction on Kong is<br /><br />a joke<br /><br />Kong is supposed to have a human relationship with Ann Darrow, and<br /><br />Darrow is supposed to have a relationship with the screenwriter played<br /><br />by Adrien Brody. That is never really accomplished. So here's Kong<br /><br />dragging Ann Darrow up the Empire State Building to face six World War<br /><br />One Sopwith Camels that look suspiciously like the one used to drag the<br /><br />Universal Sign around the World in Universal movies of the thirties.<br /><br />Times Square and other locales are dotted with Universal Product<br /><br />Placement that are supposed to be seen as clever. This movie is the<br /><br />opposite of clever.<br /><br />Jack Black is cast as the down at the heel producer who puts the mad<br /><br />venture together. He is made up to look like the young director Orson<br /><br />Welles at about the time he made Citizen Kane. Mostly Black plays the<br /><br />character as a mad scientist, his entire face often filling the screen<br /><br />with a diabolical look that rarely changes. Watts has her two front<br /><br />teeth chipmunked to make her resemble the Piper Laurie of programmers<br /><br />made for Universal with Tony Curtis in the early fifties.<br /><br />The movie is three hours long. Even Kong's death scene on the Empire<br /><br />State drags on too long. There is a reference to RKO pictures in early<br /><br />scenes as a bad film company.

0743454537|1.0|1 Star only because this book is well written.  The plot is manipulated (to the point of being completely unrealistic) to make a case against pre-implantation genetic screening.  If you know the story of the Denver-based family this book was inspired by, this book will upset you.  Facts are twisted.  This results in the spread of misinformation and is hurtful to those unfortunate enough to be in a similar situation.  Genetic screening is not baby engineering.  Why would someone want to turn something that was so helpful to a family into something so awful?
B00005JNQS|5.0|I can't come up with one thing not to like about this movie.  The animation is superb, with many a subtle whatsit worked into the background, the star-studded voiceovers are excellent (and just because Robin Williams has a relatively small part here doesn't mean he's not funny), there's wild fun and abundant laughs to be found everywhere, and there's an uplifting story with all kinds of morals at the heart of everything.  Robots is a great family film that proves as entertaining to adults as it is to children.<br /><br />This is the story of Rodney Copperbottom (Ewan McGregor), an idealistic young inventor from a humble robot family who dreams of going to Robot City, meeting famed inventor/robotitarian Bigweld, and helping to make the lives of all robots just a little bit easier.  He doesn't mind the fact that his parents can only give him hand-me-down parts, and he's not ashamed that his father is only a dishwasher in a little restaurant.  When he comes of age, though, he faces the moment when he must decide whether to pursue his dream or adopt a \\"never try, never fail\\" outlook on life.  He goes to Robot City full of vim and verve - but things aren't the way they're supposed to be there.  He can't even get in the gate, and it turns out that some schmuck named Ratchet (Greg Kinnear) is now running the company in the place of a conspicuously absent Bigweld (Mel Brooks).  Ratchet, in cahoots with his horrible chop shop bot mom, declares war on outmoded bots.  With no parts available for repairs, the older bots will have no choice but to purchase the company's expensive upgrades or fall prey to the sweeper and chop shop oblivion.<br /><br />Rodney makes some interesting friends in the big city, including a run-down crackup named Fender (Robin Williams), the aptly named Aunt Fanny (Jennifer Coolidge), and even a Bigweld corporate exec named Cappy (Halle Berry).  He sets himself in opposition to Ratchet when he begins repairing all of the outmoded robots, but he knows he can't stop Ratchet's terrible plans unless he can find Bigweld himself.  It's your classic \\"do-gooder underdog takes on the man\\" kind of film, and it works really well as such.<br /><br />You can shine no matter what you're made of; that's the message you take away with you from the film.  It doesn't matter where you come from, what you look like, or what you do - you're just as important as anyone else.  With that kind of positive message incorporated into a zany, wonderfully crafted, very funny film (with more celebrity voices than you can shake a spare robotic arm at), I have to repeat myself and say there's absolutely nothing not to like here.ows he can't stop Ratchet's terrible plans unless he can find Bigweld himself.

B000AWYOGE|5.0|Dark Water kept me at the edge of your seat and i like that they use the supernatural side.... Jennifer Connelly stars as a mother that moves into a apartment that is haunted by little girl that ends up dying in a huge water tank on top of a roof of a apartment complex!!!!!!!! I thought that this movie had a great plot and i liked the storyline!!!!!! A lot of people said that this movie sucked and had no story.... So if you like supernatural thrillers then check this movie out!!!!!!

6305949980|2.0|Long had I dreaded the day when I would be forced to sit down and watch \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\".  Not because I thought it would be horrible - in fact, I expected it to be quite good.  I've always loved Tim Burton, and the premise sounded great.  So this Christmas, when my brother received it for a Christmas present, I finally sat myself down and watched it. <br /> <br />The storyline is great: Jack Skellington, Halloweentown's spookiest spook, is getting sick of Halloween.  One day, he stumbles across a door which leads him into Christmastown - and immediately, Jack is entranced by this jolly world in which all is good all the time.  And so Jack decides to bring Christmas to Halloweentown. <br /> <br />I can sum up my thoughts about the film in two sentences, as sang by the fabulous Danny Elfman: \\"What's this?  What's this?\\"  This film is always rated very highly, but I found it to be extremely bizarre, creepy, and even a little repulsive.  I wouldn't dream of showing it to my kids, with the eerie creatures and lines such as \\"Kidnap Santa, chop him into bits\\".  The animation was fantastic, but I thought the rest of the film was weak.  There is, however, one great song, \\"What's This?\\". <br /> <br />While I can understand people enjoying this film, I just couldn't.  It's too bizarre, grim, and perhaps even grotesque for my tastes.  I suppose you'll just have to try it for yourself.
B00030590I|5.0|Hero is a beautiful work of art, a visual feast for the senses featuring a powerful, complex storyline and some of the most exquisite swordplay I've ever seen.  Western filmmakers can never hope to rival the all-encompassing quality of a film like this because, to the West, martial arts are all about action, fighting, and violence.  I'm no martial arts expert - not even close - but I do know that the true martial artist is, as the name says, an artist, one who uses his limbs and entire body as unconscious extensions of a mind that has become one with the life inside and around him; it is much more of a mental than a physical endeavor.  And, as impressive as any particular fight scene may be, it is only secondary to whatever powerful forces lead up to it.<br /><br />I see no reason why Western audiences would not be enthused by this movie; the story is built on many intriguing layers, but the basic plot is seemingly easy to understand.  Jet Li plays a nameless warrior who comes to the court of the king (Daoming Chen) of the Quin province to present him with the swords of his greatest enemies, the assassins Sky (Donnie Yen), Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu Wai), and Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung).  Quin is the largest and most powerful of the Six Kingdoms, and the king's dreams of unification have been stymied for years because of the dangers posed by these deadly assassins.  The nameless hero is the first person granted the right to come closer than 100 paces from the king in the last three years.  It is odd that the knowledgeable king knew nothing of this minor official turned hero before now, so he is most interested in hearing how the nameless warrior dispatched the three most deadly fighters in all the land.  We are shown the story in a series of cinematographically gorgeous flashbacks awash in the most absorbing, vibrant of colors.  If you're thinking this sounds like a pretty simple story, though, you are quite wrong.  The king of Quin is a brilliant thinker who questions the nameless hero's story - and, eventually, the elusively remarkable truths standing at the heart of this epic film are revealed.  Hero is sure to play more powerfully to the Chinese who see in the king of Quin the man who united the disparate kingdoms and basically forged the Chinese nation-state, but the revelations imbedded in this intriguingly complex story contain nuggets of understanding for all who will see, hear, and contemplate them.<br /><br />The fight scenes that dominate the film are just exquisitely done.  You don't see a lot of martial arts films centered on the sword rather than hand-to-hand combat - probably because swordplay is difficult to master and choreograph.  The performers make it look as natural as breathing in this movie, however - it's not only incredibly impressive, it's extraordinarily beautiful to watch.  Wires schmires - it's pure poetry in motion.  Tan Dun's soundtrack only adds to the wondrous effect with its endlessly haunting strains.<br /><br />What really makes Hero stand out is the complexity of its characters.  The nameless hero, Sky, Broken Sword, Flying Snow, the king of Quin - these are not simple warriors; they are intricate creatures with deep, long-standing motivations, connoisseurs of the art they pursue, master strategists, dreamers, and men and women with ideals far more powerful than themselves.<br /><br />I have to mention the fact that Ziyi Zhang appears in this film as an apprentice to Broken Sword - although hers is not a major part.  Many will recognize her from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and House of Flying Daggers.  For my money, she's the brightest light in Hong Kong cinema.<br /><br />This film is truly epic in scope - in terms of the cinematography as well as the incredible performances.  The only recent martial arts film I rate higher than Hero is House of Flying Daggers - and I don't expect any movie to top that extraordinary masterpiece any time soon.the nameless hero's story - and, eventually, the elusively remarkable truths standing at the heart of this epic film are revealed.

B000002J1Y|5.0|The remastering is great. It's a worthy replacement for the original vinyl in every way but one: the cover. Those of us old enough to own the LP fondly remember its extraordinary fold-out cover offering 3 records plus a multi-page photo book. It's impossible to recapture that in  modern jewel case. So this one you'll have to buy for the great music only...
B00097DX3U|2.0|I really liked Sound Garden.  I loved Audioslave's first CD.  This CD just is a pale shade of the first effort though.  While riff-dependent in general, the Out of Exile tracks really lack the energy and hard rock flair in the first CD or those of RATM (though I don't like RATM for the most part since I'm not a rap fan). <br /> <br />Cornell's voice is the biggest dissapointment.  Maybe he recorded after too much touring, I don't know, but when you compare the pitch and quality of his voice on the first album to this 2nd album, he's really dropped off.  The pitch in his screams is off and lacks the depth in previous albums.  He really sounds like a guy whose hoarse from talking or yelling too much.  His quality is still excellent when singing at a normal level, though many of the songs on Out of Exile don't reach his upper ranges as often as previous albums and I have to wonder if that's intentional, since it's higher ranges that involved more scream singing and thus more stress to his voice. <br /> <br />It's a shame because Chris Cornell has one of the best rock voices of all time. <br /> <br />I'll undoutably buy their 3rd CD if/when it comes out simply in hope the flaws in this album aren't a sign of things to come.   <br />

B000002UJQ|5.0|Admittedly I got into Radiohead only recently, along with Coldplay. I've heard other Radiohead albums and other rock albums and without a friggin' doubt: Ok Computer is the best album to emerge from the rock scene in the past 10 years. The epitomal Radiohead album. The perfect Radiohead album. The album in which concept, lyrics, voice, music, execution, production values, creativity, overall thrust and passion collide to create an awesome listening experience. This is my newest 'desert island' album if I were to be stranded. <br /> <br />Subterranean Homesick Alien is my favorite song. It hums like it could send a rocket to Mars and back and then head to far off distants. Subterranean Homesick Alien. It's sick in its perfection. Other favorite songs from Ok Computer include Paranoid Android, Karma Police, Air Bag, No Surprises...and all the other songs. Nothing sucks here. Nothing even comes close to being half-good. It's all premium music with Radiohead being at the apex of their musical career. This album was released in 1997? I wasn't ready for it back then, not by a long shot. I was ready to embrace this album in 2005. <br /> <br />The only other Radiohead album I feel almost as strongly about is The Bends, it's a great album. But Ok Computer is the one. It's the album even Radiohead have trouble competing with(Oh my god we made this album- now what?). It's the Abbey Road, Dark Side of the Moon and Led Zeppelin IV of modern rock. Own it, listen to it, live with it, be it.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|WOW...I mean wow!!  I purchased the series on dvd about 4 months ago because I'm a Whedon-holic and really do love his ability to create completely realistic characters and I must say, Firefly didn't dissapoint; even for a guy who doesn't really like westerns or science fiction like me.  Serenity was a spectacular movie that complimented the series wonderfully.  I guarantee that if you have even a slight interest in this movie, you will ADORE it!!  Those of you who liked The Fifth Element will definately enjoy this film.  Now, one guy mentioned that if  you watched the series, you'll have a bit more of an understanding to the film and he's right...albeit, please don't let that stop you from watching this film.  Joss Whedon did an incredible job for pleasing fans of the show along with newbies. If, IF, you can, try to watch the series and I guarantee you will see what I'm talking about.  If not, don't worry.  Some of the action sequences left me with my mouth wide open, I mean they were brilliant (the opening really gets you pumped).  This is one of those really rare movies that when I finished watching it, I played it once more.  The characters, the special effects (for having a budget of under $50 million, the special effects are INCREDIBLE), the storyline...you will love this movie, plain and simple.
0393327655|2.0|As a Christian scholar with a skeptical streak, I am always on the look-out for good attacks on my faith. Harris, a neuroscientist and Stanford grad, is bright. He has a gift for good, straight rhetorical jabs -- \\"120 million of us place the big bang at 2,500 years after the Babylonians and Sumerians learned to brew beer.\\" And there is no doubt he is aiming at theistic faith. He wants to show that (1) Religious faith does not care about evidence; (2) It is also contrary to the evidence; (3) Religion is more harmful than just about anything; (4) Moderation in religion is no virtue; (5) We can get by without God anyway, thank you very much, and (6 ) The only good thing about religion is the unitive state of consciousness, as experienced in Advetic and Buddhist meditative practice.  <br /> <br />Harris did not challenge my faith, though, for a simple reason: he appears almost entirely ignorant of what Christians think, why we think it, and gobs more. Despite a long bibliography, in essence Harris is asking us to take his points on blind, or at least tunnel-visioned, faith.  <br /> <br />First, in his discussion of faith itself, Harris reveals how thinly he has read in Christian thought. Referring to a few Bible verses and often out-of-context quotes, Harris concludes that religious faith by definition is \\"an act of knowledge that has a low degree of evidence,\\" or none at all. He ponderously and repeatedly informs us that such \\"faith\\" is a bad idea. Of course it is! The fact is, the need to base faith on evidence has been the NORMAL Christian position for two thousand years. (Including such central thinkers as -- list alert! -- Justin, Clement, Origin, Gregory of Nazianzus and of Nyssa, Augustine, Aquinus, Calvin, Matteo Ricci, Descartes, Locke, Pascal (The \\"wager\\" is not all he wrote!), Cotton Mather, John Wesley, Kepler, Schaeffer, C. S. Lewis, J.P. Moreland, John Eccles, John Paul II (read fairly), Richard Swinburne, Mortimer Adler, and John Polkinghorne. For quotes,see my article on faith and reason at christthetao.com.) In fact, Harris' view depends on stacking the deck and culpable ignorance. He cherry-picks a few quotes to show Pascal and Augustine in the worst possible light, pans John Paul's thoughtful book in a glib sentence or two, misrepresenting his views on faith, and ignores the rest entirely.  <br /> <br />Harris is wrong then to assume that in theory, Christianity recommends \\"blind faith.\\" But what about practice? How does Harris' argument that religious faith \\"floats entirely free of evidence and reason\\" make out? Or his argument that \\"religion\\" is liable to get us all killed, and freedom from religion to save us?  <br /> <br />Here again, the problem is not that Harris grapples with contrary arguments and loses, but that he does not appear to have met any at all. I realize some of the examples I give may sound fantastic to readers who share Harris' views. But the only way one can know if they ARE fantastic is by reading and fairly considering these arguments; to deny arguments without reading them is simply to beg the question.  <br /> <br />Harris is a philosopher. Has he read debates between William Lane Craig and leading atheist philosophers on the existence of God? Has he read such seminal philosophers as Plantinga (at Notre Dame) and Swinburne (Oxford)? These folk are several rungs above him in the academic pecking order. He has a right to challenge their arguments. But for a neophyte to dismiss the contrary claims of leading thinkers in his field without so much as a mention, reveals an arrogance, ignorance, or both, that disqualify his views in the mind of any reflective person.  <br /> <br />In the 20th Century, leading astronomers were shocked to find the universe had a beginning, sometimes resisting the idea because it seemed to veer too close to Genesis. Many have also been amazed to find how finely tuned the cosmos appears for life. (See quotes by Einstein, Jastrow, Davies, Penzias, Ellis, etc in Ross, Creator and the Cosmos.) Steve Hawking credits the same Augustine upon whom Harris heaps such scorn with being the first person to realize that time began with the universe -- an idea he and other early Christian thinkers likely derived from Scripture. What does Harris have to say in response to these well-known facts? Nada.  <br /> <br />Harris also ignores the Pullitzer-Prize winning arguments of the atheist psychologist Ernest Becker, who records his shock at finding the insights of Otto Rank closely following the \\"naive\\" Biblical intuitions of Kierkegaard: \\"Such a mixture of intense clinical insight and pure Christian theology is absolutely heady. One doesn't know what kind of emotional attitude to adopt towards it.\\" Harris has his attitude picked out: contempt, based on unsullied ignorance.  <br /> <br />Nor does Harris deal well with history. If evidence for the resurrection is so bad, how do people like William Lane Craig come off so well in debates with leading skeptics?  Has Harris tackled the arguments of the great British historian N. T. Wright for the resurrection, or the evidence Gary Habermas has amassed after a thorough review of the relevant literature? How does he deal with the detailed arguments of sociologist Rodney Stark (and leading secular historians) that Christian theism led to the invention of science and the end of slavery? What does he say to Indian philosopher Vishal Mangalwadi, who argues that the mysticism Harris loves ruined India, and Christian reform helped save it? Or Shanghai historian Gu Weiming on how the Gospel helped China? Was the great scholar Hu Shi (a skeptic and colleague of the founder of the Chinese Communist Party) mistaken when he said Christian missionaries \\"taught us many things, the greatest of which was to look at women as people?\\" How does he respond to U-Cal Berkley historian Irwin Scheimer who described the great good \\"Samurai Christians\\" did in Japan? Has he read Brian Tierney's anthology in which medievalphilosophers quote the New Testament as they formulated the modern concept of separation of church and state? Or Stanford anthropologist (and one of the greatest living French thinkers) Rene Girard's argument that the Gospels \\"secretly controlled\\" the long process by which mankind realized that the poor and weak should be treated kindly?  <br /> <br />On all this and more, Harris offers not a peep. He simply asserts, over and over again, that only a child or a fool would think there is evidence for religion. He even shows contempt for the Bible as literature, in the teeth of the views of even great writers who were atheists. This is fanaticism.  <br /> <br />Nor, as informed reviewers note below, does Harris do better in regard to Buddhism, on the history of which he is surprisingly naive. (Tibet Buddhists, white hats, Chinese, black hats? There have been entire dynasties when Tibetan Buddhists were the oppressors and the Chinese were on the receiving end! As for Inquisitions, I could show you hot springs in Japan where Catholics were boiled to death.)  <br /> <br />Nor, again, does Harris deal seriously with the most spectacular social experiment of modern times -- the rise and fall of Marxism-Leninism. He mentions communism three times, only to dismiss it as a secular \\"religion,\\" along with Naziism -- which he blames on Christianity! But in the 20th Century, communists helped one third of the planet throw off the bonds of religion. Harris writes of the Inquisition, \\"There is no other instance in which so many ordinary men and women have been so deranged by their beliefs in God.\\" Yet over twenty-five years, Joseph Stalin alone killed more innocent people EVERY DAY on average than the Spanish Inquisition over all Spanish dominions in all of 300 YEARS! (Read the books, Harris, and do the math!) Communist torturers taunted victims with some of the same enlightenment slogans he finds so liberating. (Lenin himself shared Harris' view of religion, and his talent for anti-religious hyperbole: \\"A thousand epidemics and plagues are to be preferred to the slightest notion of a god.\\") Despite this history, names like \\"Solzhenitsyn\\" and \\"Wurmbrand\\" are absent from his bibliography. I have known some of the victims.  <br /> <br />A rabbit in the Chronicles of Narnia sat by a great waterfall and listened to whispered conversations a hundred miles away. So Harris sits in close chronological proximity to a roar of suffering caused by his fellow skeptics, and hears the pin-prick of the Inquisition a thousand miles away. If a materialists want to argue that religion is harmful, they need to grips with the dark side of anti-religious history.  <br /> <br />How could anyone make it through one of our best universities, study in graduate school, write a book for a major publisher, and take such a profoundly shallow and ignorant approach to his subject? And this book is lavishly praised by the Economist, Guardian, New York Times, Amazon, Richard Dawkins, and -- sorry to see -- John Derbyshire! His ignorance is obviously a symptom of something in the air, but seems self-imposed as well. He has, after all, read the Bible, along with a few great Christian thinkers of the past. But he notices only the worst. He is like a person who goes into a mine of rich gems, and comes out with scraps of sub-bituminous coal.  <br /> <br />On page 13 Harris complains that \\"The central tenet of every religious tradition is that all other religions are mere repositories of error.\\" As a scholar of religion, I consider this ignorant poppycock, as regards many religions, including my own. But on page 15, Harris writes, \\"The very ideal of religious tolerance is one of the principle forces driving us towards the abyss.\\" So \\"religions\\" are intolerant and therefore bad, and yet his own intolerence will save us, somehow.  <br /> <br />One feels, as William James put it, an \\"impatience at the ridiculous swagger of the program, in view of what its authors are actually able to perform.\\" Like fireworks over a lake, Harris' rhetoric sizzles, but little but himself is illumined, still less set ablaze.  <br /> <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man
0440180295|3.0|\\"Slaughter House five\\" by Kurt Vonnegut a story about a Writer attempting to write a story about his experience as a prisoner of war at Slaughter house # 5 and the bombing of Dresden during World War 2. By page 29 or so He finishes his book and from this point you read his book. It is about Billy Pilgrim who was also in a POW in Dresden but Billy believes that he was abducted by aliens who experience life in the fourth dimension, translation, they experience time like a photo album, hence they feel all points of time are always in existence, time doesn't really pass, they can live at any point in their existence at any time. Billy learns to view time in this way and is constantly waking up at different points of his life. Of course he may just be going crazy. Many of his \\"Time traveling\\" and \\"alien abduction \\"ideas are quite similar to stories from a Sci-Fi novelist who he befriends after returning from Dresden.<br /><br />The Good: The book is well written, making it easy to read. Not a lot to expand upon, it was easy to read, wasn't boring even when a lot wasn't going on in the story.<br /><br />The Bad: Vonnegut (or his characters in this story) is a little left of center for me and this view came across in the book. Not that it ruined it but it was noticeable to me (which is to be expected as it is considered to be an anti war book). Lines like \\"I have also told them (his sons) not to work for companies which make massacre machinery, (Military equipment) and to express contempt for people who think we need machinery like that.\\" I noticed that the horror of Dresden was constantly mentioned. How they couldn't understand why the Amreicans had bombed it, but very little mentioned of how bad the German's and their concentration camps were. The story was a little sporadic as it bounces around from time to time but it didn't confuse as it explains what's going on.<br /><br />Overall not a bad read with the exception of its political standing (may be down your alley though). Was enjoyable and worth reading though I wasn't inspired to run out and read more of Vonnegut.worth reading though I wasn't inspired to run out and read more of Vonnegut.
0312995423|2.0|TRANSLTR is perhaps the most powerful multiple parallel processor computer on the earth, run by the National Security Agency, dedicated solely to the process of brute force code breaking. An extraordinary weapon against crime, drugs and terrorism, TRANSLATR clearly has enormous potential for human rights abuses and Ensei Tankado, a brilliant program and disgruntled former NSA employee is determined to find a way to pull this abusive tool out of the hands of the government. He has written DIGITAL FORTRESS, a complex algorithm that renders clear text into unbreakable code, and, unless the NSA acknowledges the existence of TRANSLTR to the world with a full confession of its true power, Tankado will release DIGITAL FORTRESS to the world. Of course, this would render TRANSLTR instantly obsolete and chaos would become the order of the day. Drug cartels, terrorists and other criminals could secretly communicate with complete impunity and US internal and external intelligence would become effectively blind. Tankado delivers his blackmail ultimatum and is promptly murdered by parties unknown. Of course, the frantic chase is on to find the key to DIGITAL FORTRESS and bury it before it is released through the internet to anyone who has a modem.<br /><br />When Brown sticks to the \\"techno\\" side of techno-thriller, he is a master on solid ground, indeed. Brown's side bars about computer software and hardware, codes and code breaking are exciting and informative. Revolving around puzzles, viruses, worms, firewalls, mutating code strings and the internet attempting to hack into US government data classified \\"top secret\\", the climax of the novel moves at top speed and is definitely finely tuned edge-of-the-seat stuff! But novels by their nature must be populated with characters and here Brown fails rather badly, producing folks that can best be described as trite, cardboard and clich&eacute;d. Susan Fletcher, the brilliant but beautiful cryptologist with an IQ of 170, is the first to step up to the plate as a stereotype (I can clearly see the movie version now where she makes the transformation from computer nerd to ravishing hottie by taking off her glasses, pulling the bobby pins out of her tight bun, dropping full-bodied hair onto her shoulders with a provocative head shake and undoing the top button of a silky blouse!) Her fianc&eacute;, David Becker, a mild-mannered foreign language specialist from Georgetown University, discovers he has the abilities of a master spy and is able to elude the efforts of a professional assassin. Sadly, virtually every character Brown pulls into the story can be criticized in the same fashion as being singularly off the wall and unbelievable.<br /><br />Don't misunderstand - Digital Fortess is a quick read and is thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining! But like most every one hour made for TV thriller movie, it is also eminently forgettable in very short order and has nothing at all to commend it as being memorable!ep up to the plate as a stereotype (I can clearly see the movie version now where she makes the transformation from computer nerd to ravishing hottie by taking off her glasses, pulling the bobby pins out of her tight bun, dropping full-bodied hair onto her shoulders with a provocative head shake and undoing the top button of a silky blouse!)

0441009425|4.0|This is the first of Reynold's novels I have read.  Overall I would say I liked it.  It's an intriguing story, with the hallmarks of so-called hard science space opera.  I recommend it.<br /><br />However, his writing was a bit purple alot of the time.  Excessively flowery, with chracter dialogue being both unrealistic and - yes - operatic!<br /><br />But it began well, ended well and I am going to hunt down other works of his.
0553801503|3.0|Having read the previous George RR Martin books in his A Song of Ice and Fire series, I was unimpressed with this latest addition, A Feast for Crows.  Nothing really happens.  This was the first of his books in this series that I could put down and go to bed.  There was just this general sense of....apathy I had while reading it. <br /> <br />And then I realized this may be what Martin was going for.  Even the title Feast for Crows, symbolizes what happens after a battle.  The dead rest, a pall forms across the battlefield, and the crows pick on the corpses of the dead.  This is exactly the theme found throughout this novel.  Having dealt with the constant war and action of the first 3 novels.  Book 4 is sort of a pause in the story, a chance to take stock.  It is here that the \\"crows\\", i.e, the survivors of the ongoing warfare across Westeros, begin to pick the corpse of the shattered kingdom.  Throghout the story, an \\"every man for himself\\" theme begins to arise as the balance of power shifts among the great houses of Westeros. <br /> <br />Despite this theme however, and the mastery of his writing craft Martin shows throughout the series, the book nonetheless remains dull.  Save for a combat scene by Brienne (don't worry, nothing spoiled), there is little to interest the reader.  As several have said, this book has shades of Robert Jordan's comatose Wheel of Time all over it.  In addition, several prominent characters are discussed briefly but otherwise not in this book at all.  At the end, Martin explains this was an intentional omission.  He had produced enough material for 2 books, and will update the overlooked characters in his next book. <br /> <br />With that said, A Feast for Crows is good reading, not great.  Fans of the series should read this to appreciate Martin's skill as a writer and a creator of a unique world, but should also not expect to be overwhelmed by any action in these pages. Hopefully, the slow pacing of this book is meant to refresh thestory, and is not a warning of a Jordanesque collapse of the story under its own weight.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|I originally asked for this CD because I liked the song \\"I Wish I Had An Angel.\\"  Once hearing the other songs though, I realised it was by no means the best song on the CD.  \\"Dark Chest of Wonders\\" is my favorite by far out of all of them.  This is going to sound weird...unless you've heard it...but I can hear pirates in the song.  Not pirates singing \\"yo ho ho and a bottle of rum\\", but I can hear the adventures they're having.  I don't know how to explain it because it defies explanation.  Buy this CD; it is well worth the money.
B000002534|3.0|The last of Santana's jazz fusion albums, Borboletta is really a mediocre album.  Too many of the songs are boring, and Leon Patillo isn't really the best singer.  The instrumental montage at the end, Here and Now, Flor de Canela, and Promise of a Fisherman are really the only great songs on the album, with the exception of one or two others.   <br />It was about time for Santana to return to it's latin roots. Only Canto de las Flores shows a hint of latin sound. <br />It's also good to hear David Brown on bass agaim. He would even stick around for the following album, Amigos. <br />Chepito Areas's timbales only appear on one song, and Michael Shrieve would leave the band for good after the album was released.  He was responsible for at least 60% of Santana's sound. Without him, Santana would never again sound the same as the glory days. <br />If you like jazz fusion, you might want to get this album. But if you want to listen to the afro-cuban/rock Santana, grab the following album, Amigos.

B000067J1H|4.0|If someone picks a fight with you, will you run - or will you fight?  Most people will run.  One of the premises of Fight Club is that modern men have become emasculated and have lost the ability and desire to fight.  Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) offers men a chance to get in touch with their confidence.  It is a secret underground fighting club.  No weapons, no team-ups, no refs, just old-fashioned, one-on-one fistfights.  The main rule in Fight Club is that you can't talk about it.<br /><br />Ed Norton plays a timid, insomniac auto recall investigator who goes to medical support groups to feel better about himself and get some sleep.  He meets Marla, a woman with similar low self-esteem.  Marla is also a support-group junkie.  Right away, he dislikes her intensely, and they start arguing.<br /><br />He meets Tyler when his condo is mysteriously blown up.  Lost without his Ikea furniture, he moves in with Tyler.  The two start the club.<br /><br />Based on the book of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club (his first novel - wow!) is different from any other movie out there.  Completely free from the Hollywood blockbuster formula, the movie offers laughs, black humor, and some serious questions about masculinity in the modern age.<br /><br />Just as a completely unrelated aside, Brad Pitt is so damn gorgeous!!!

A 25 year old playing a 17 year old trying to play a private detective on the UPN ... all reasons not to watch, right?  WRONG!  I decided to buy this set to check out the hype and quickly saw it was not hype.  I stuck the first disc in on Sunday to check it out, figuring I would only watch the pilot and have already gone through 4 discs.  In fact, my parents came in on episode 4 and they are hooked too.  We can't wait to finish.  I know that hype usually doesn't pan out ... but trust me, buying this set will not be a waste of money.  I am confident you will love it!!!

0670033375|5.0|Diamond initially focuses on how environmental abuse caused the collapse of several societies - eg. those on Easter Island, the Norse in Greenland, and Chaco Canyon settlements in New Mexico, and the Mayas in South America made choices that seriously affected their environment and subsequently limited their ability to survive. He then goes on to cover Rwanda (severe economic pressures from overpopulation providing a climate that encourages civil war), and China - where an enormous population, combined with efforts to dramatically improve living standards, is creating the risk of future environmental catastrophe.<br /><br />Diamond, however, does not offer concrete solutions, nor project the outcome of current U.S. policies, perhaps because doing so would have become overly controversial to cover adequately in an already 500+ page book.<br /><br />Nonetheless, Americans need to rethink our impact on the environment. In particular, we need to replace our lack of effective action on reducing illegal immigration, fuel consumption, and carbon-dioxide emissions. Significant improvements in these areas would reduce our serious trade deficit, funding of volatile groups in the Mid-East, unemployment and declining real wages, crowding and demands on dwindling natural resources, and poor image in other areas of the world. It would also encourage or force Mexico etc. to more effectively resolve their own problems.<br /><br />A number of years ago The Club of Rome tried to raise awareness of the need for substantially improved environmental sensitivity. It largely failed - hopefully Diamond will be more successful
B0009S4IHY|5.0|Let's face it:  there is an irreducible silly element to many kung fu movies.  What Stephen Chow has managed to do in both SHAOLIN SOCCER and KUNG FU HUSTLE is take the silliness and raise it to the nth degree, creating some of the most marvelous parodies that I have ever seen.  What is amazing is that while he expertly picks out the more absurd elements of those films, his own films, though comedies are in fact far less silly than those films that intend to be far more serious.  A fruitful comparison is some American comedic parodies, such as JANE AUSTEN'S MAFIA, which never rises above silliness.  The comedy here in KUNG FU HUSTLE is broad, but it is never simply dumb.<br /><br />The story concerns the conflict between the Axe Gang in Shanghai and the residents of Pig Sty Alley.  The time is supposedly the forties before the Revolution, but it seems oddly ahistorical, a Shanghai that never really existed.  World War II seems never to have occurred or left a mark on the place and there is no hint of the Communist uprising that had been taking place since the thirties.  Still, the film has a believable period feel despite this.  A petty thief named Sing (played by the film's writer and director Stephen Chow) pretends to be a member of the Axe Gang and attempts to bully some residents of the slum.  This inadvertently pulls in the real Axe Gang, which descends on the community only to be turned back by three of the residents who turn out to be kung fun masters incognito.  The rest of the film consists of escalations in kung fun mastery as the Axe Gang brings in their own kung fu masters, until the end when one individual proves to be the greatest kung fun master of all.  This would all be insufferably dull except that every twist and turn is handled expertly by Chow.<br /><br />It should be noted that the two most elaborate fight scenes were directed by the great Sammo Hung, the legendary Hong Kong star and director perhaps best known in the United States for his highly underrated television series MARTIAL LAW.<br /><br />I think this film will appeal both to fans of Hong Kong cinema and to fans of the more surreal shaolin films.  Whether it will appeal to a wider audience I am unable to say, but I would urge those with even slightly open minds to give this a try.  If you enjoyed CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON or HERO, you would probably enjoy this highly accomplished parody.highly underrated television series MARTIAL LAW.   <br /> <br />I think this film will appeal both to fans of Hong Kong cinema and to fans of the more surreal shaolin films.

B000056N8X|3.0|Yes, this one it's a very mixed bag. It have some elements from the movie franchise plus the elements from the TV serie with Adrian Paul. The end of this Ending Game is not my favorite thou, because I like more Connor than Duncan. Well, not exactly for that. I just thought it wasn't time for Lambert to leave the franchise. Not that way.<br /><br />Anyway, it is a very nice story about hope and faith. It also have Jim Byrnes as Joe Dawson, the watcher. The final battle is great, but the end makes you watch all other old Highlander movies again.<br /><br />Now they will again give a new direction to the story of the immortals with the new movie, The Source, the first part of a trilogy. It will have Duncan, Methos and Dawson on the script. Let's hope that the end of Connor at least have left a legacy. I wish them luck to bring us another great and epic story.

An excellent description of his character, his tactics and his attitude with his men. A very strong character well worthy of his legend.

B00005JO1Y|2.0|I loved Lord of the Rings, but was really bored by this one. Don't get me wrong--they are two very different projects, but King Kong lacked the heart the trilogy had.<br /><br />When you tell a story in classic form, it's important that your audience cares about your characters...but most of the \\"protagonists\\" were unlikable--the rest were unrealistic or shallow. The ape himself--in appearance and performance--was awesome, but the rest was just...well, there. The biggest action scene was as mindless as most Jurassic Park sequences. Dinosaur vs. gorilla. Dinosaur and other dinosaur vs. gorilla. This time add obstacle, etc., etc...<br /><br />If you explore this movie hypothetically, you get the real truth: 1) If King Kong had been Jackson's first big movie, people would have wondered why the hell he bothered--his achievement of Lord of the Rings earned him respect...i.e., he must know what he's doing, right? But I'm not so sure, this time...<br /><br />And 2) if you remove the special effects from King Kong, you only have a thread of a story, and very little interesting content.<br /><br />After 3+ hours, I felt nothing.
B0009XNUK0|2.0|Who cares if people accuses him of molesting little boys!!  I believe he didn't do it, unlike OJ (he did it!!).  This isn't the place to give negative reviews about the G.O.A.T. (greatest musician of all time).  Although he is one of the greatest and more talented, what I did not like about the compilation is the absense of the #1 Jackson 5 hit, I'll Be There (was also not included on his box collection), Lovely One, or his #1 collab with Paul McCartney, Say Say Say (although it was a Paul McCartney song).  Although time had to be conserved while making the double cd, I didnt care for 45 single edited verions of Don't Stop Till You Get Enough (you DONT CUT OUT THE INTRO, you edit it like it was on the video) and Wanna Be Startin Somethin'.  The later was the first time it was included on any cd and was edited terribily.  Ditto for Thriller.  Other than 45 versions and absense of I'll Be There, Lovely One and Say Say Say, CD 1 displayed MJ's best.  As for CD 2 (stuff from Bad, Dangerous, and one each from History and Invincible) I could care less, but I do agree with previous reviews about adding Scream (with Janet - #2 R&B and #5 pop) instead of Dangerous (which was NOT even a hit in the U.S.).  If the record company was to include MJ's lp tracks, they should put in Lady In My Life or Workin' Day & Night.  Although I do not actually own a copy (I listen to most of the edited songs), They did pick most of the good songs to be included, but Thriller, Dont Stop, Off The Wall (too) and Wanna Be Startin Somethin' are hit songs that should NOT be included edited! - Nuff Said

B0000TB01Y|4.0|While I'm sure the show is phenomenal, the recording itself is slightly overrated. While there are some amazing tracks such as \\"For Good\\", \\"No Good Deed\\", and the amazing \\"Defying Gravity\\", as well as Indina Menzel in the role of a lifetime, the recording doesn't live up to all of the hype that I've heard. On problem, IMO, is \\"What Is This Feeling?\\" that, while a fun song, seems a bit pointless and could have easily been scrapped for dialogue as it is so repetitive. The balance also is off. While I think Kristen Chenoweth is adorable, her vocals seem cranked up much higher than Idina's in their duets, particularly \\"Food Good\\". So, if you want to hear Idina Menzel, you'll have to look for her solos on this recording, because she gets blasted right out. Other than that, it's a fun recording, with a more emotional and powerful second half, which helps it out. I'm seeing the show next October, and I can't wait.
B00005JOFO|3.0|I think Brokeback Mountain has been transformed into something well beyond a movie. People either kneel before it lavishing uwarrented praise or villify it in the most degrading and hateful terms. But it really is just a movie.    Coco Channel famously said, \\"Never add. Take away.\\" Brokeback Mountain was based on Annie Proulx's short story...SHORT story. How it ended up a movie well in excess of 2 hours is a mystery to me. It feels padded and bloated. Proulix used such spare language that she kept her story in brutal focus. The movie loses its way. The beginning scenes and the ending scenes are dead on. The look, the feel...they fit Proulix's original material like a glove. Its the vast middle section where things go very wrong. So much material has been added and embellished concerning the two men's marriages and wives that their relationship with each other becomes background. The movie becomes more a study of the failed marriages than an exploration of their profound bond. That element played as a tragic backdrop in the original story. The tragedy of these two men carried mysery in its wake. In some ways I felt we learned more about the wives than the cowboys in this film. The mid section becomes kind of ponderous and slow.    When Ang Lee succeeds he does so greatly. The entire early part is excellent. From the opening seconds when the two men first see each other the attraction is unmistakable. Their \\"romance\\" is not treated in typical Hollywood style of guazy close-ups, longing eyes and trembling lips. Its very real and natural, told in subtle posing, stolen glances, gradual opening up and fear of making that first move. After that first move has been made Ennis and Jack seem completely natural and comfortable with each other. Its very real. Jump ahead to the end, and it once again finds its heart. A paunchy, middle-aged Jack bitterly confronting Ennis with all the \\"what ifs\\" and \\"we should haves\\" that their lives have come down to is very effective and sets up the sad and dismal end very well. Wisely the end is also not treated in typical Hollywood fashion. Ennis' visit with Jack's parents is a study in things not spoken. The end is certainly depressing and profoundly sad, but never resorts to sentimental Hollywood tearjerking. Its a very raw and honest finish. Lee never presents us with a typical villain who embodies the prejudice and bigotry. It pervades the whole movie like a smothering force. Lee keeps an emotional distance and seems to simply point his camera at a very sad story. The approach makes it very universal.    The performances are wonderful. Heath Ledger certainly deserves all the praise he's gotten. He completely disappears in this role and the effect is amazing. Jake Gyllenhaal is also excellent. Michelle Williams as Ennis' wife is very effective, but Anne Hathaway is pretty weak. Randy Quaid is great in his small role and while he illustrates bigotry and contempt perfectly he never turns into a cartoon. Roberta Maxwell and Peter McRobbie as Jack's parents are wonderful. He can barely contain his disgust and disappointment. She is a study in heartbreak and hidden understanding.    If 30 minutes had been cut out of the mid section this would have been an excellent movie.
B000005ILF|4.0|I grew up listening to, and loving, sting's music. When this cd came out I was a kid, But my dad always had it. I recently found it and it's been in my cd  player non-stop since. Its a gorgeously crafted CD, one of my favorites. The only reason I don't give it 5/5 stars is because Lithium sunset is not a very strong song for this CD. Buy it, you won't be disapointed.
B00005JLPK|5.0|Watching Frida requires a little suspension of disbelief, since we have Mexicans in their home country speaking English.  Purists desired a Spanish soundtrack, and perhaps a Latin director, but if you can move past that, Frida is an amazing movie.<br /><br />This film is visually stunning.  Frida's paintings morph out of the scenes of her life, and the colors throughout this film are absolutely amazing.  This is a film that made me want to learn more about the life of Frida Kahlo, and anyone who is familiar with her paintings will love seeing them come to life on the big screen.<br /><br />Salma Hayek acts beautifully, but Alfred Molina nearly steals the screen with his portrayal of painter Diego Rivera.  Their troubled relationship makes this a romance/drama, but politics (communism) also play a huge role in their lives.  Frida is a masterpiece of a film, well deserving of critical acclaim.
B00028HBKM|3.0|Mel Gibson poured millions of his own money into creating this movie, and spent incredible amounts of time researching the historical accuracy of every detail. In that sense you can say the movie is the \\"child\\" of Passion of the Christ, which had previously raised the bar in historical accuracy of Biblical movies. Gibson even went so far as to film the entire movie in Aramaic, Latin and Hebrew, the languages of the time. Mel's vision was to document the last 12 hours of Jesus' life in excruciating detail, using the Gospels and historic research to make this as accurate as possible. There are minor problems - like nailing the hands instead of the wrists, and the Romans speaking Latin instead of the more common Greek - but most is very well done.<br /><br />It would have been a very interesting film if he had done this task in a \\"traditional\\" manner - having the last supper, having the scene with Pilate, having the crucifixion. We've seen all of those scenes done before, many times. We know them and understand them. The key issue that made this movie so incredibly controversial was the amount of GORE involved in Mel's vision. In addition, many Jews felt uncomfortable that the movie made them culpable for Jesus' death.<br /><br />Let's take the second issue first. Jesus did in fact rail against the current Jewish powers many times. Remember, he was a Jew himself! He was raised in the Jewish fashion. He was taught to follow those laws. But he felt many of those in power has corrupted the laws. It is like modern Catholics taking a stand against priests who rape children. Jesus wasn't saying \\"all Jews are evil\\". He was saying \\"You who do these certain practices should stop.\\" Naturally, those who were in power took steps to protect their power. All Jews who exist in modern times aren't responsible for the actions of those leaders 2,000 years ago. It's something that happened in ancient times.<br /><br />I don't find the movie to be an indictment against all current Jews, any more than all current Christians are individually responsible for the horrors of the Inquisition. All religions had leaders at some point who did \\"bad things\\". We can't erase history and pretend it didn't happen. We learn about it, we understand it, and then we do better in the future.<br /><br />So, on to the gore part. First, I think we can all agree that crucifixion was a horrible way to die. There's been plenty of research on it - on the foot-rest and bottom-rest that helped ensure that the victim didn't asphyxiate immediately but rather lived in agony for days - to know that this was a public display of absolute agony. And as if that wasn't enough, they would beat the person very severely first, so that they were in pain before they even went onto the cross.<br /><br />To see anybody going through this process would be incredibly heart-wrenching to watch. To see someone go through it who did it *willingly*, in order to save all of mankind, is of course even more powerful. I accept that, and understand how meaningful it is to those who believe in the message of love and peace that Jesus was trying to spread. It would be like seeing Martin Luther King, or Gandhi, tortured in slow motion for 3 hours straight.<br /><br />That all being said, the \\"truth\\" of the situation was bad enough, without having to exaggerate it. It was like watching a Kurosawa film at times, with the huge amount of blood involved. It got to the point where you began to think, \\"You must be kidding!\\" That is a real shame, because most of us accept that Jesus was a historical person who went through this, whether or not he was a messiah. This was a truly awful punishment he went through. It should be appreciated as such, not overdone.<br /><br />A side problem with turning the \\"punishment\\" part of the movie into such an overly violent one is that kids cannot see the movie. The story, with its authentic setting, languages and well done acting, could have been incredibly powerful for kids to see. As it stands, the movie would give them nightmares for months. Jesus didn't preach psychologically scarring children and young adults. He preached love and gentleness.<br /><br />You could propose the argument that Mel should have filmed all of Jesus' life, not just the last 12 hours. Maybe he should have filmed the last 12 days. But of course, any director who makes a movie chooses what to make the movie of. Mel chose the last 12 hours. Since that is what he wanted to focus on, that's what he did. We as viewers have to accept that. There are certainly enough other movies that cover the other time periods. However, if Mel IS going to take on the final 12 hours of Jesus' life, it would have made sense to have those 12 hours be shown in a meaningful manner - that is, tell the story of the events that happened in those 12 hours, and why they were important.<br /><br />Instead, it's almost as if, to Mel, the volumes of blood pouring out were the only story. The other characters around the blood are pretty two dimensional. There are crying people, there are laughing people, there are impassive people. There is Jesus, in incredible pain, and there is blood. It's not a story as much as a bloodfest. It's not watching a movie as much as watching a documentary of someone being tortured for multiple hours. And again, it's not even a documentary - it's a very exaggerated portrayal of that activity.<br /><br />Surely we could appreciate the pains that Jesus went through just as much with a realistic portrayal. Also, surely those pains would have had even more meaning if they were given a context. If we could have seen more interaction between Jesus and the Jewish leaders, between him and the apostles, between Judas and the others. In the time span given, Jesus didn't \\"do\\" much. He didn't have a choice. He just lay there writhing while pain was inflicted on him. It's not really that he \\"willingly\\" took the pain. He *helplessly* took the pain, like a newborn puppy. That's not beneficial to watch - it's desensitizing.<br /><br />To say you must endure multiple hours of excessive gore to understand Christ is like saying you must watch multiple hours of graphic child rape scenes to understand why child rape is bad. There's a reason that soldiers often come back from war and don't want to talk about the experience. It's truly awful. They went through it to keep the rest of us safe. They have serious psychological problems as a result. We don't show people graphic documentaries of our friends and families being horribly mutilated in order to understand the soldiers' issues. Yes, I realize crucifixion is awful, I realize the pre-crucifixion beatings were nasty. But to make that the only message of a multi-hour movie, when so much *meaningful* content happened during that time period and was ignored, seems to be quite against what Jesus himself preached. He preached love, forgiveness and peace. This movie is soaked in blood, and embeds violent, graphically gory visual images in the viewers' heads. I don't think that would be what Jesus wanted people to remember him for.e. As it stands, the movie would give them nightmares for months.

B00008DDSC|5.0|Secretary is a timeless dark sexual thriller about a passionate sadomasochistic relationship.  Maggie Gyllenhaal is a frustrated, aimless secretary who self-mutilates until she finds satisfaction in being dominated by her boss, James Spader.  Is the lesson here that the \\"self\\" part of self-mutilation is the problem, so one must seek a healthy outlet in a S&M relationship?<br /><br />The movie truly highlights that the dominant partner does not wield all the power in an S&M relationship.  As the plot develops, it becomes clear that Maggie exercises great power over her boss, that he needs her desperately.  The relationship is beautifully developed, and this is no cheap exercise in kinky sex.  Highly recommended to those who want to watch dark, steamy, thrilling cinema.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|Not since THE EXORCIST has a film captured the true terror of demonic possession as THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE.  The movie is a terrific courtroom drama and a terrifying horror story of demonic possession.  The movie raises the question of the validity of demonic possession, and lets the viewer determine whether or not the possession has occurred.  Based on true events in 1976 Germany, the movie opens with a Catholic priest being charged with negligent homicide in the tragic death of young Emily Rose.  Father Moore had attempted an exorcism on the girl a few days earlier, and her death is blamed on him, as he had suggested she stop taking her medication.  Emily had been diagnosed as epileptic with resultant psychotic tendencies; Father Moore and the girl's family believed Emily to be possessed by demons.  An ambitious agnostic attorney is hired by the Archdiocese to serve as his defense, and a Methodist prosecutor is representing the state.  What truly elevates this distinguished film is its cast.  Laura Linney, one of today's best actresses, gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Erin Bruner, the hot shot defender who finds herself questioning her own beliefs during the course of the trial.  I've always admired Ms. Linney's work even in below average films (e.g. Congo) and she rises to the occasion in this riveting performance.  Equally brilliant is Tom Wilkinson, who plays the tormented priest who wants to tell Emily's story and insists he is not responsible for her death.  Nominated for an Oscar for his performance in IN THE BEDROOM, Wilkinson gives a sincere and intense picture of this good man.  Campbell Scott gives one of his most effective performance as Ethan Thomas, the churchgoing prosecutor who leaves his beliefs outside the courtroom and is determined to see Father Moore convicted.  Jennifer Carpenter is devastating as Emily, a girl tormented by demons and the destruction of her life as she knows it.  Her performance is so real it is disturbing at times to watch what happens to her.  Joshua Close as her boyfriend is also very good in a demanding supporting role.  Director Scott Derrickson keeps the movie riveting with superior timing and some really spooky scenes.<br /><br />THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE is a marvelous film that asks us to question what is possible in this straight-laced world of ours, and stays with you long after you view it.watch what happens to her.

B00005JMFQ|5.0|I was a bit apprehensive about watching a movie with a series of disjoined storylines, but Love Actually revealed itself to be a masterful film with storylines that interconnected on literal and metaphorical levels.  A viewer can't help but be sucked into these storylines, brilliant acted by the cast of Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant, Kiera Knightley, Rowan Atkinson in a delicious cameo, and others.<br /><br />The soundtrack beautifully integrated the different scenes of this movie.  An external sound-over (background music) from one scene would transition into sound-in (music playing in the scene) in the next segment.<br /><br />This movie explores all different types of love--fragile relationships, people that magically fell together, relationships being constructed piece by piece, unrequited love, glorious crushes, the pursuit of physical satisfaction, and more.  This is a testament to all the different forms of love, from the joyous to the mundane to the painful.
B000BKVQTS|4.0|Terry Gillkiam shows his Monty Python roots in this entertaining fantasy film.  THE BROTHERS GRIMM is like watching a more sophisticated version of the old TV Fractured Fairy Tales, using elements of several Grimm fairy tales but giving them sardonic twists and turns.  In this film, the titular brothers are con artists roaming villages of French occupied Germany, allegedly ridding the villages of evil enchantments.  Things take a dangerous turn when they are captured by the French and forced to find out what is happening in a small village where ten children have mysteriously disappeared.  This leads them to the Mirror Queen, who has cast a spell on the village and is using the children's blood to return to life; she is now an old crone, and wants to be beautiful again.  Production values are excellent with superb effects and moody settings.  The tongue in cheek humor instills the movie with its sense of fairy tale wonderment and the acting is generally good.  Matt Damon plays Jakob, the more mature brother who is like a keeper to his rather nerdish younger brother, played by Oscar hopeful Heath Ledger.  They play off each other very well and seem to be enjoying themselves as well.  Lena Headey is the fair Angelika, whose two sisters are among the missing children, and she acts as a tracker for the brothers.  Peter Stormare gives an over the top performance as the General's aide.  Stormare surely gives his role 100% per cent, although his accent is sometimes very hard to understand.  Gilliam alumni Jonathan Pryce plays the General and he is very good as well.  The lovely Monica Belluci plays the Mirror Queen quite seductively.  THE BROTHERS GRIMM is an entertaining take on fairy tales and was overly blasted by many critics, but I think you'll find it enjoyable.
B00004XMV6|5.0|This definitely doesn't belong in the Romance or Drama category.  It is worthy of a Steamy, Deviant Sexual Attraction genre all of its own.  Basinger and Rourke toy with a fine line between pleasure and pain, and I kept expecting the games to go too far, to turn deadly, and that keeps the viewer and Basinger (as the submissive) on edge throughout the sexually deviant games.  The balance of power between the two lovers slowly shifts throughout the movie, making for edge-of-your-seat viewing and a surprising ending.<br /><br />This is a movie that breaks many taboos, not just fun naughty ones, but deep-seated cultural ones.  There are some unforgettable scenes (don't miss the striptease scene, which is amazing two decades later!) and a great soundtrack.  The apartments epitomize 1980's \\"modern\\" d&eacute;cor.  9 ½ weeks is a must-see for any film fan.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Ok.  Let's face it, a lot of the \\"true\\" DT fans out there, hate this album.  That's fine.  Most of these people are traditional prog fans who think that music should take you here and there and everywhere. Some sort of musical journey.  If that's what floats your boat, then ooookay. <br /> <br />For those of us to like to hear metal music played by some of the best musicians ever to pick up their instruments, then this is a GREAT album.  It is my favorite of ALL DT albums.  Like most of the rest of the reviewers here, I got hooked on DT back at I&W, but I liked the heavy stuff.  Awake was incredible, and I thought I had found another favorite band.  Then Falling Into Infinity showed up.  BLECH!  That was it.  I packed it in and went on to other things.  I completely ignored DT until I heard As I Am on the radio, and it truly piqued my interest.  I listened to some samples online, and was truly overjoyed with what I heard.  So I ran out and bought the album.  Heck, I even bought the tabliture book.  Then I thought, maybe I should go back and pick up some of the albums between FII and ToT.  &lt;sigh>  That may have been a mistake.  There are some great songs on there for us metal lovers, but not enough to merit buying the whole catalog, as I did.  Even so, I thought maybe the band would stick with the new angle, and I picked up Octavarium on release day without hearing a single track. <br /> <br />Well... back to the same ol' same ol' <br /> <br />Metal fans: rejoice, this is your album. <br />ToT bashers:  just throw this one out, chalk it up to them exploring another part of their roots (gee! they did cover the entire Master of Puppets album, live), and go enjoy the rest of their stuff.
B0007OCG4W|4.0|This is a complex tale about love double-crosses between two couples.  There isn't a heck of a lot of development of the relationships, and people do have sex willy-nilly, but it is fascinating to watch the power struggle between members of each twosome.  Those who have the power early in the film lose it by the climax, and emotional havoc is brought on again and again.  The film portrays how easy it is for a person to be attracted to more than one other person, each for different reasons.<br /><br />The film can be a little difficult to watch, as great lengths of time pass between scenes with no warning.  Everything comes together by the end.  Natalie Portman's performance (also her stripping scene) are absolutely not to be missed.
B0007RT9LM|5.0|Wannabe songwriter Violet leaves her small New Jersey town with dreams of being a songwriter. Despite her fine singing voice (dubbed by country star LeAnn Rimes), terminal stage fright limits her dream to writing music. She moves to New York to pursue her dreams, but is frustrated by the industry system (need an agent to sell, can't get an agent until you sell). She takes a job dancing on the bar at Coyote Ugly and finds fun, friendship, romance, and a doorway to her dream.<br /><br />John Goodman of \\"Roseanne\\" gives another fine performance as Violet's dad as does Maria Bello as the bar owner, and Piper Perabo as star-struck Violet. The soundtrack is a great toe-tapper, and watch for LeAnn Rimes' cameo at the end.<br /><br />The \\"Special Edition\\" itself is a disappointment; the love scene is \\"spiced up\\" unnecessarily and the additional scenes really don't add much. This was a fine film by itself. Still well worth purchasing.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|After years of waiting... and rallying... and giving away the original TV series box set, \\"Firefly\\", to friends and family as gifts... and doing my part... I was rewarded with this film.  Thank you Joss!  I loved... no... I adored every single moment of this film. <br /> <br />However, now I have this feeling of loss.  Not for anything that happened within the film, but because now that I've seen it... and there is currently no news of a sequel... I have nothing to look forward to.  However, I'm hopeful... <br /> <br />When I first tagged the title \\"Browncoat\\" to my sleeve, I had a sense of belonging to something special... something important.  When this film hit the theaters, it confirmed that feeling.  It's brilliant.  If you've never been a part of our 'verse, then see this film.  If you enjoy it, then go check out \\"Firefly\\".  If you don't have the coin to put down for it, then you can watch my copy if that's what it takes! <br />
B0002S943O|5.0|I have been a depeche mode fan since the late 1980's and I must say that it was this tour and the album they were promoting that put the band at the peak of their career. Many will disagree with me,especially those in the Los Angeles area who attended the Rose Bowl show some few years earlier. Rock n Roll history will show that every time a batch of bands make it big during a certain decade,very few will survive going into the next decade when they are encountered by a swarm of young new bands and/or a new sound of music. The Stones survived when exiting the 1960's,Bruce Springsteen survived when exiting the 1970's,and Depeche mode survived when exiting the 1980's. By the time this tour took place,80's alternative music was replaced by the grunge sound and new non-american bands such as those from England were rare to find. Fortunately few 80's bands like Depeche Mode were still alive and keeping their fans happy. A few years ago,fans were asked on the Depeche Mode official website what Depeche Mode concert on vhs would you like to see on dvd,and the Devotional concert was voted number 1 by a landslide. It was about time they put it out. The setlist is one of the best among DM concerts on vhs or dvd. It features the best of the best of DM songs at the time,unlike the \\"live at Paris\\" dvd where the majority of songs were from the \\"Exciter\\" album and \\"Ultra\\" album,an album Dave Gahan said was his least favorite DM album (source...Blender magazine). This is also the DM dvd to get because it was the last tour to feature Alan Wilder who sadly decided it was time to leave following the end of the tour. It was also the first DM tour to feature the band with back-up singers. I must admit that the back-up singers used for both the singles and exciter tours were absolute horrible and useless but the ones used in this tour were excellent and used only for the necessary songs needed. I saw this show in Los Angeles in november of 1993 when they played not 1 or 2 ,but 5 shows at the Forum. To see this tour on vhs was great but to see it on Dvd with several extra songs not on the vhs version is far beyond great!! JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH!!!!!

B0001HLVS2|5.0|And fire on the uproll is just what Director Peter Weir does in this brilliant adaptation of the wonderful Aubrey/Maturin novels by Patrick O'Brien. The movie combines elements of more than one book and spins a tale of chase and combat between sailing warships that is unmatched by any other movie. The frigate \\"Surprise\\" (HMS Rose) is beautifully photographed and really gives the viewer a sense of what these vessels were like. Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany are more than able in their respective roles and the rest of the casting is excellent. Scenes of combat and daily life on the ship are well done. Costuming and period detail is quite perfect. The scenes of the Officer's meals in the Captain's cabin are very entertaining, as are those of the seaman. Scenes of the Galapagos Islands add much to the movie and help flesh out the relationship between Aubrey and Maturin. The heavy weather scenes as the Surprise rounds the Horn are very realistic and frightening to a sailor like myself. The harsh life of the Royal Navy is well depicted. The section that dealt with the burial of the dead at sea was very moving.<br /><br />I have read all of the fine books in the series and am pleased that the movie captured many elements of these wonderful historical novels.<br /><br />If you have Moby Dick, The Wake of the Red Witch, or Captain Blood on your movie shelf, then you will love this.
B000B8QEYC|4.0|I am a bit disappointed about this cd. I was very anxious because i wanted to listen to a new enya's cd. Today, i listened to it and i discovered that something is missing.  <br />I dont know what is it, but it misses. Maybe, there are no the rythms of some well known songs as Orinoco Flows or Anywhere is. <br />I loved some songs as \\"Amarantine\\", \\"Less a pearl\\" (Excuse me if i dont remember very well the songs.),and other. <br />But if i had to choose between \\"A day without rain\\" and \\"Amarantine\\", i would prefer the first one.
B000BISBDY|4.0|First the Winning:<br /><br />I am a Johnny Cash fan.  I've been disappointed that simple, single cd collections just do not have the songs I want.  This one does the best job of any inexpensive, single cd I've come across.  This is by far my favorite, that is why I purchased 5 of them to give out as presents.  The liner notes do an excellent job, in a limited amount of space, at describing the reasons each song is included.  I like the chronological way the tunes are put together.  With 21 cuts it has more than the typical Cash cd.  This product is a winner.<br /><br />Now the Warning:<br /><br />I am a pastor.  Johnny Cash was a prominant Christian figure.  Every person I gave a cd to was a Christian.  When you take the cd out of it's case, there is a large, quite obvious picture of Johnny flipping you the bird.  It's sort of funny when you think about it, that I would give these out to people.  I didn't know it at the time.  I hope they didn't take it wrong (you know the sibliminal message sort of thing).  I know one person simply covered the picture with a piece of paper.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|This movie is based on a real life exorcism of a German student and subsequent criminal trial of the priests who performed the ritual. The producers chose to set this story in small town America.<br /><br />It doesn't matter whether or not you believe in a higher or a lower power.  What matters is that you turn down the lights, kick back and suspend belief for a couple of hours.  Once you turn back up the lights you might just view your world differently.<br /><br />This is a fast moving and thought provoking real-life drama that demonstrates clearly the age-old struggle between good and evil.  There is no projectile vomiting of day old pea soup, but there are any number of hard to watch special effects that will keep you going back for more, scene after scene.<br /><br />It is well-acted and well written, and the cinematography is without flaw. I strongly recommend this movie, if only for the entertainment value.  Then again, wondering if there really is a devil will leave you wondering if there really is a God, and that may not be a bad thing.

All AA says is to: <br />1. admit problem <br />2. believe in something/someone to help you <br />3. clean house <br />4. make amends <br />5. help others <br />  <br />That is ALL AA is about.

B000BTJDGC|4.0|\\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\\" held my interest from beginning to end. The film is well acted; the direction is judicious; and the special effects are riveting and yet restrained (There is no \\"yuck\\" factor of spewing green pea soup!). I also enjoyed the original manner in which the director interspersed the courtroom scenes with the \\"horror\\" scenes, which are intentionally left ambiguous. In other words, the director leaves it to the viewer to decide whether the events are figments of the girl's hysterical imagination, brought on by physical reasons, or an actual possession by demonic forces. The extra featurettes are very interesting, especially the one in which the production designers explain their symbolic color schemes and the special effects.<br /><br />Having acknowledged the film's strengths, I am not certain that I was entirely convinced by the courtroom scenes, when I often knew the exact response that one attorney was about to give the other (Too many episodes of \\"Law and Order\\"?). Also, I was not particularly frightened by the hysteria-or-demon sequences. I suppose as a college professor I can understand why  a student might envision paranormal manifestations during final exams (although I would attribute the phenomenon to lack of sleep--or study--rather than to demonic possession).<br /><br />On the whole, I think that the story would have worked better had it been set, not in middle America, but in Germany (where the story on which the film is based originated). I might then have bought the fact that the girl had studied Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic in her catechism class (I wonder how many such classes in the United States still offer even Latin!). Were the film set in \\"another\\" country, I believe that the audience could have suspended their disbelief more easily, and accepted the plausibility not only of the courtroom sequences [Imagine the barristers and judges in periwigs!] but also of the demonic possession [One of the frightening aspects of \\"The Others\\" is that it was set in the fog on the Channel Island of Jersey.].<br /><br />Perhaps I am being overly cynical. But, in an era when every student I know owns a cell phone and has access to instant messaging, the premise of the girl alone in her dorm room being possessed by demons [real or imagined] is a bit hard to swallow.of \\"The Others\\" is that it was set in the fog on the Channel Island of Jersey.]. <br /> <br />Perhaps I am being overly cynical.

B000A6T1JU|3.0|THE BASEBALL FURIES!!! <br /> <br />Talk about ruining a scene.  They should have at least included the theatrical release in this disk for people who don't like their cult classics screwed up by directors.

B0002OERI0|5.0|Ah Green Day, how we love thee. Has it really been 16 years for these guys? Seems like just yesterday I was listening to a new lil' band from Cali in my room. Memories...anyway \\"American Idiot\\" is Green Day's latest album. It seemed like an eternity when the guys were away, but the wait was worth it. What our wait gave us was a much more mature, artistic, and eloquent musical experience. As a whole the band has improved. Vocally, lyrically, musically, this album is above and beyond even Green Day's standards.   <br /> <br />Some have started screaming foul because Billie Joe decided to dawn the black clothing and mascara. But the fact is that this transformation began happening to Billie Joe before bands like MCR made it an \\"EMO\\" (I hate that term). And to call Billy Joe or Green Day \\"EMO\\" would be like calling Britney Spears \\"Metal\\". The fact is that Green Day A) grew up and B) transformed themselves. The band went through a very rough period as a group and basically were reborn. The thing that some seem to not understand is that the guys are not 20 anymore. Their 30. Pre-Idiot music like Dookie  was coming from a more teen angst/anger direction. It would be very odd to see 30 year old men singing about teenage issues and trying to look 15. <br /> <br />As for the people who hate this CD for the \\"anti Bush\\" theme listen here. American Idiot isn't just about Bush. There is a very good story that is told through this album and only a few songs are politically based.  <br /> <br />Musically Green Day has got to be the best 3 man set there is right now. Tre is nothing short of amazing at the drums. Mike has really expanded his range as far as guitar work goes. And Billie Joe? Well Billie is Billie. Vocally Billie Joe sounds stronger and more clear. Artistically the band has really stepped it up. Billie Joe's lyrics have matured very well here. The result is a CD full of singles. <br /> <br />As for this being \\"pop/punk\\" I'm not going to lie. It is...in a way. But thathas been Green Day since day 1. And as for there being a lot of \\"teeny boppers\\" running around posing as Green Day fans: let `em. The fact is everybody knows that this band is great. Go to a Green Day concert and I can tell you first hand that there are no \\"teeny boppers there. It is 15-50 year olds. Anyone who hates this album is coming from a background that is in support of the president and the war or hates the fact that Green Day isn't posing as something their not. If this CD weren't good then they wouldn't have won 32 awards with it and gone quad platinum. They have always won awards even with Dookie, but never like this. When I'm listening to Green Day in my 40s hopefully I won't have to hear any more of this \\"sell out\\" babble. In any case this is the definitive band of this generation. A band that has been around 16 years and already could be going into the Rock & Roll hall of fame in 06. I've been a Green Day fan for years and I grew up with them. It is only fitting that they did to.
B000088E6D|5.0|Since I was a kid, I've always  preferred Billie Holliday and Ella Fitzgerald to any of the pop stuff my friends liked. Natalie Cole's CD was a breath of fresh air(Unforgettable) into this forgotten genre, and nothing vocally has blown me away since then till this CD. He has \\"IT\\". His charisma comes through the CD. His velvety voice reminds me of a mix of Mel Torme and Frank Sinatra, minus the cheese (sorry fans). His musical esthetic is also terrific-tasteful, not too much ornamentation especially early in the song, and he really blows when it's needed. I can find no weakness in the quality of his voice nor in his technique. Another reviewer said his \\"Fever\\" is the best rendition yet, which is heresy! Lee's is the standard, but his version is definitely fantastic. I only wish other people in  my age group (30s) could discover big band!
B00005JO1Y|5.0|I have not seen any of the Lord of the Rings movies and probably never will, just not my thing, but I was all ears when I heard that Jackson was remaking the legendary Kong film which, in my opinion was due for an update.  So here I sit in the theater and everyone is quiet and the film starts and the film ends and I'm left with this feeling of pure happiness.  It was the most fun I've had in the theater in a LONG time.  I mean, don't get me wrong, this year hasn't been without some great movies, but this was a little of everything...it was funny, emotional, dramatic, creepy and moving all at the same time.  Watts was great as Ann, Brody was decent, Black was great and KONG WAS FREAKING AMAZING...he was the best actor in the bunch.  He was funning and emotional and damn near brought everyone to tears.  Don;t listen to people who dog it or say it was too long...it was just right.  It did the origional MUCH DESERVED JUSTICE and stands alone as one of the best epics to grace the screen in a long time.  CGI was amazing, script was tight and the directing was brilliant.  Jackson should get a nod, maybe a win...SEE THIS MOVIE!
B000BP86OG|5.0|I gave \\"Permission to Land\\" 5 stars because it deserved them, but I have to say that \\"One Way Ticket\\" doesn't.  5 stars won't even touch what this album should get.  80s music is my favorite genre, and this album comes straight out of 1980.  Even songs that don't grab you on the first listen, if you just give them a chance, they grow on you.  Every track has redeeming qualities that make you appreciate this band's labor in the studio to give us music that will make you feel good and want to rock out at the same time.  I hope they continue with this 80s sound.  Favorite tracks: \\"Knockers\\",\\"Dinner Lady Arms\\",\\"Bald\\",\\"Girlfriend\\",\\"One Way Ticket\\".
B000BW7QWW|4.0|First off: I am a browncoat.  This is the first time that I have signed on to a \\"fan\\" thing (club, zine, whatever...) since I was a kid.  Being that I'm on the wrong side of 50, that's saying something.  Why 4 (and a half!) and NOT 5?  Because the film could not scale the heights of character development that a continued (reborn) TV series could have attained. <br />As a stand alone film, there was simply TOO MUCH story to tell. <br />Read the other raves and you will have me agreeing with them 9 out of 10. <br />As far as a pure Sci-Fi film, it is as good and better than any I have seen lately: Potter 4 (4... snooze); Sith: (Yawn, snooze until the pretty damn good Volcano planet... I was distracted by the CGI effects which were so pervasive I found myself analyzing textures, and lighting synchronization, etc); War of the Worlds (good film, but give me a break, with all that technology they had to use tentacles with cheesy cameras to sniff out survivors???  Do you REALIZE how long that would take??? Cmon...  Even better than Batman Begins which I really enjoyed.  Better than Fantastic Four (yeah, I hear you chuckling too...). <br />For the price they are asking for this DVD edition (I have a multizone machine and thus can play the Zone 1 version over here in France) the DVD package as such deserves a solid 5. <br />Now the film itself, for the far too many of you who took a pass during its all too brief run in the theatres: Joss Whedon did what Speilberg, Lucas, and so many others seem no longer able to do: he took difficult material (I mean: HOW to breing viewers who had NEVER seen the 14 epidodes of the series up to speed, keep them spellbound until the final finish, all with a relatively small budget?  Well, here's how he did it: character development on the fly, and he hooked in 90% of the viewers who DID see it.  Special effects came second place to the true story telling.  And for pure content we give them a 5. <br />Here's the browncoat guarantee:  Buy the Firefly Serenity combo package deal.  Watch all the episodes through.  Then once again with the commentaries.  Then read the book \\"Finding Serenity\\", then the Dark Horse Trilogy and THEN view the Serenity DVD.  If, after all that you are not happy.  Sell your combo on ebay.  You WILL find a buyer (we browncoats snap them up for cheap gifts for friends, such is our evangelical zeal... watch OUT, papa Hubbard) and you will only be out the price of a couple of tickets to the movies.  And you will have been intertained for well over 20 hours.  There is a good reason that Serenity is number one and Firefly is number 3 on the Amazon list. <br />Neurochuck...

B00005OWEG|1.0|Apocalypse Now is certainly one of my favorite movies of all time, and the redux is still a great movie, but the original cut is much, much better. Redux has some good new character development, but what it does to Kilgore ruins it altogether. Redux includes a bunch of buffoonish Kilgore clips, turning one of the all-time legendary favorite movie characters into a dork.<br /><br />Stick with the original!
B00005JOM9|5.0|Felicity Huffman gives, hands down, one of the sharpest and bravest performances this year as Sabrina \\"Bree\\" Osbourne, a LA-based transsexual a week away from his/her final operation to rid himself/herself of the genitalia that reminds him/her that he/she was once an unhappy man named Stanley. However, this is not an extended, over-the-top comedy skit, nor a preachy social commentary film on changing sexual roles. Rather, it is an often ribald farce that gains its dramatic resonance from the spiraling convolutions of the plot and an unexpected poignancy at key moments along the way.<br /><br />With his first feature-length film, director-writer Duncan Tucker has fashioned a spirited road movie that matches Bree with the 17-year old son he/she ever knew existed, Toby, a homeless, teenaged delinquent who was the product of Stanley's fumbling attempt at sexual relations with a long-ago girlfriend who recently died. A true odd couple along the lines of Walter Salles's \\"Central Station\\", Bree and Toby make a cross-country trek from New York, where Toby was in custody, back to LA. It all sounds pretty contrived. However, in conveying Bree's prim manner, academic wellspring of knowledge and droll humor, Huffman grounds the film with an amazingly convincing impersonation of a man on the threshold of becoming a woman physically and struggling to keep up with the gender transition emotionally.<br /><br />Tucker wisely paints Bree's menial job as a telemarketer as a way to disclose that Stanley has been struggling for years to build the self-worth to become a woman, and Huffman responds with her character's weary demeanor and tense posture. In what could have been a minefield of burlesque comedy opportunities, there is not a single false note in her acting, as she makes the controlled lady-like movements and studied vocal intonations believable traits of Bree. She is also made up simply without fuss (an expert job by Jason Hayes) to look credibly like she is precariously on the male-female border with a constant fear of falling back to her character's old self.<br /><br />Fortunately, Huffman is surrounded by a strong supporting cast. Although he often seems to be channeling Edward Furlong and Leonardo Di Caprio in portraying Toby's sullenness, Kevin Zegers captures his character's confusion and angst with emotional accuracy. Tucker also wisely uses some wonderful, under-the-radar actors in key roles - Elizabeth Pe&ntilde;a (whom I have not seen since her poignant turn in John Sayles's 1996 \\"Lone Star\\") as Bree's strong-minded therapist Margaret; Graham Greene (Kicking Bird in \\"Dances with Wolves\\") as Bree's wishful suitor Calvin Manygoats in a sweetly rendered episode of unrequited love; and a surprisingly laid-back Burt Young (Paulie in all the Rocky films) and an especially histrionic Fionnula Flanagan as Bree's parents heavy in denial over their offspring's decision.<br /><br />In fact, Young, Flanagan and Carrie Preston as Bree's cynical, addiction-recovering sister Sidney are all hilarious in the movie's comedy peak as the dysfunctional family from hell when Bree and Toby barely make it to her hometown, Phoenix, prior to her operation. The family feeds almost too easily into Bree's self-doubt but ultimately acts as most families do when crises occur. The film has a few serious moments that veer toward melodrama to heighten the revelations involved, but Tucker thankfully does not belabor them, favoring instead the shrewd, absurdist comedy elements. This is definitely an unexpected gem worth seeking out.rder with a constant fear of falling back to her character's old self.    Fortunately, Huffman is surrounded by a strong supporting cast.

0451522834|5.0|If my experience is indicative of anything, more people think they have read Charles Dickens' \\"A Christmas Carol\\" than actually have, probably because you know the story from osmosis nearly as soon as you register the concept of Christmas. But there's a lot of originality and strange twists to the familiar legend, as well as the satisfaction of having it delivered in Dickens' classic, unique prose style.<br /><br />Published in 1843, \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is undoubtedly the most famous novella of all time, organized in five \\"staffs\\" or musical measures in keeping with the title. The story itself works as a melody, simple in structure but with a lot of enchanting detail and discursions, as it tells the tale of the rehabilitation of one Ebenezer Scrooge from \\"squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner\\" so mean as to deny his assistant coal to heat his workspace, to the very epitome of Father Christmas.<br /><br />There's a lot of bits of business in the story that give it a freshness to the first-time reader, however well he or she thinks they know the story. Like the appearance of the first spirit, a fantastic sprite with \\"a bright, clear jet of light\\" emanating from its head. Or the trip Scrooge takes with the second spirit, of Christmas Present, where they speed across the seas to see Christmas celebrated by sailors and lighthouse keepers. One of the most haunting moments is when Scrooge, with the third, most ominous spirit, sees his own belongings picked over by a trio of low city dwellers in a \\"low-browed, beetling\\" shop, a lesson on materialism valid now as then.<br /><br />The story of ghosts is thrilling, and its emphasis on home and hearth heartwarming, yet the secret to the story's appeal is its focus on Scrooge, presenting us with a radiantly foul character who over time slowly discloses his inner child, one not unlike Dickens himself who had to suffer the indignities of a workhouse because of insensitive parents.<br /><br />\\"You fear the world too much,\\" his younger self is told by a maiden he courts as she rejects him. \\"All your other hopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its sordid approach.\\"<br /><br />The message of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is the world Scrooge fears is a good place at heart, and rewarding to those who are good at heart. However humbug it might read here, Dickens' narrative itself dispels all doubt as gently and completely as a gust of wind does a cloud of smoke. And it's a fun read all the way through.<br /><br />The Signet classic paperback edition I have includes three other Christmas writings from Dickens, \\"The Christmas Tree\\" from his \\"Reprinted Pieces\\" which captures the darkness beneath Dickens' warm sentiment for the holiday; \\"A Christmas Dinner,\\" a sketch of a Victorian middle-class family gathering which in its short length is nearly as joyous a seasonal keepsake as the \\"Carol\\" itself; and finally, an excerpt of \\"The Pickwick Papers\\" which includes a ghost story involving merry-making goblins and an unfortunate sexton that clearly evolved into the later \\"Carol.\\"ounger self is told by a maiden he courts as she rejects him. \\"All your other hopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its sordid approach.\\"    The message of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is the world Scrooge fears is a good place at heart, and rewarding to those who are good at heart.

B0002IQJUK|5.0|Wow.  What an album!  I stumbled upon Gavin DeGraw on a website  [...] and was dumbfounded at the talent Gavin DeGraw has!  At first, I couldn't believe the voice I was listening to was coming from this young guy....his voice is so controlled, so experienced, so weathered.  He is amazing to watch live - but the real test comes when listening to him live with your eyes closed.  With every song, it's as if he is desperately trying to make you understand the words and feelings flowing through him - and is quite successful.  He has a much older soul than what he should.  One of 2 of the best albums I've bought within the past 2 years!  A must have....
B0009R1T7M|3.0|Perhaps the most critically acclaimed indie release of 2005, 'Illinois' is an ambitious though often bland opus.  Stevens continues his 50 States Project with this lengthy collection of light, sometimes orchestral indie folk.  The bloated song titles border on pretension, especially those for the half-dozen sub-minute tracks.  'Come On Feel The Illinoise' is the highlight; 'Chicago' is also good.  Pitchfork dubiously named this the best album of 2005 - I suppose that if I lived in Illinois I'd probably enjoy this much more.

0060764899|4.0|Any child or adult would sit up straight to hear the story of the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe from start to finish. Mr. Lewis had the talent of capturing readers' attention especially children's then grasping their interest throughout a whole story. This tale is drolly told right through the entire book. It is a gripping adventure taken by four siblings who are actually eagerly anticipated by beings in another world. There are entities of rivalry, greed, betray, merriment, kindness, magic, and triumph for each person's enjoyment. Although the end is too fantastic that amnesia or giddiness might have been the cause for the four children's forgetfulness of their origin, the immensely entertaining technique of narration overcomes the poor conclusion.
B000286RKW|5.0|This is a film about the Mafia but there are other aspects that make it such a memorable film , such as being in a gang no matter what the cost and the demands of keeping up a certain lifestyle .      Martin Scorcese takes you on a ride that is a little draining but the actors show you why that is . The people either burn out , go to jail or die .    One could say that the moral of the film is that ' crime doesn't pay ' , but that would be too simplistic and there are more layers to the film .    The commentaries are informative and the Special Edition is very welcome .   Buy this version of the film to get a better perspective on the whole thing .

B0007Y4USW|5.0|This album is called \\"The Return of the Voice,\\" for a very good reason.  Mariah is at her best, here.  With a combination of retro-R&B sounds (made evident in the percussion and keyboard interludes) and a restored 5 octave range, for the blonde diva, she kicks her album into high gear.<br /><br />\\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" gives her audience a new glimpse into the diva, her personal triumphs and tragedies with a collection of intimate love songs.  These songs feature some of the hottest rappers in the industry, today.  (Nelly and Twista, as examples).  She even does a duet with Snoop Dogg, in \\"Say Somethin'.\\"  Carey shines on her ballads (the often played \\"We Belong Together\\" and \\"Don't Forget About Us\\") and the less-played dance tunes (\\"Stay the Night\\"--a throwback to the era of Minnie Riperton, \\"To the Floor\\" with Nelly, among others).<br /><br />This album is brilliant.....I have nothing more to say, besides, \\"Buy this!\\"  I have already played three times through, since the time I bought it yesterday.  It is great for workouts or just hanging out.  Carey is back, baby, and better than ever.
B0002VKZL6|3.0|First, the disclaimer:  I'm a GenXr with the obligatory nonexistent attention span, a taste for 1920s music and no real ear for rock.  Even I could tell this was beautifully put together and did a masterful job of slyly quoting other pop influences.  But I found myself doing a lot of fast-forwarding through this gift CD.  There were some interesting concepts among the lyrics, but there wasn't much here that got me to listen for the full 4, or 5, or 7(!) minutes.  \\"Yeah, ok, got it, next...Elvis who?\\" was the general reaction.  A few of the faster songs kept my attention:  \\"Postcards\\" of course, \\"Don't Crash the Ambulance (You Dimwit)\\", and inexplicably, the twelfth track about a snake-oil salesman - the putative emotional content is so wonderfully inappropriate to the subject matter.  But by and large, if I want slow, I'll stick with Bert Williams.
0780619951|2.0|Well, I can't say that the storyline of the Dr. Moreau flicks is bad, it's an interesting blend of scientific and horrific.  The 70's version of the film is actually pretty good.  This update adds some more color to the characters, and some more advanced makeup and better visual effects.  Well, if it weren't for the poor script this might be a worthwhile film.  The movie starts off with an interesting naration, but 2/3 characters are killed after about 30 seconds and we never get to know them or care about them, which isn't good.  They should've started it off in the airplane instead of the exact same way the 70's version started.  Also, the editing of this movie is probably the worst I have ever seen of any film.  The best example of this is a scene that ends with Dr. Moreau saying \\"Tomorrow we will have a trial\\" and the next scene shows the main character trying to escape on a boat and being threantened, not attacked, by BADLY animated mutant rats.  The next scene is the trial, and the rats never show up in the movie again and are never mentioned by anyone.  Who had the brains to do that?  There are plenty of other examples, but see for yourself.  I'm not sure about this unrated director's cut, but I doubt it can save this mess.  There are scenes that cut to a completely different location involving the same characters that seemingly pop up there in no time.  The movie doesn't make any sense, and there isn't enough development of, say, oh, DR. MOREAU.  He is the title character isn't he?  Well, he gets killed off way too early, and it's just not satisfying as he has no real defining roll in the climax of the film.  I can't say you shouldn't see this, it's a little interesting to see editing and writing's negative effects on a movie if you don't know what I'm talking about, but if you don't want to see a bad movie, don't see this.
B000BW7QX6|2.0|Virtually everything I loved about the \\"Firefly\\" series is missing from the movie. The storyline of \\"Serenity\\" is only tangent to the \\"Firefly\\" narrative; the movie actually loses ground gained in \\"Firefly\\" when it comes to mutual trust, affection, and respect. \\"Serenity\\" also lacks the easy western pace and humor of \\"Firefly\\", to say nothing of the good lighting and always audible dialogue of the TV series. In short, \\"Serenity\\" most nearly resembles a video game. Much shooting and hacking and stabbing. Two of my favorites from among the original \\"Firefly\\" crew members die (although they are all favorites -- part of the strength of the series) and even the spaceship Firefly is finally smashed to pieces. I've watched the DVD of the TV series four or five times now and gave it to half my friends for Christmas in 2005. Would not consider giving the movie to anyone.
B000050FEN|4.0|This is not for the faint of heart. <br /> <br />David Fincher's dark style really shines in this film.  The characters are excellently developed, and one really does care about what happens to them.  The story is sort of odd for a detective movie, leaning a little on a Christian undertone, but it's never really played up too much, which is good in my opinion, because those types of things can detract from movies (End of Days).  This is probably one of Kevin Spacey's best roles, as the serial killer, John Doe.  Morgan Freeman does an excellent job as Somerset.  Brad Pitt really shines because he plays a sort of average detective and not some wierdo or \\"seductive\\" guy.  Gweneth Paltrow's part is small, but in the scenes that she's in we get to know her character well.  The mood of the movie is really dark, and it's really apparent at the ending, which is one of the most brutally intense that there is.  Don't expect to walk away from this movie feeling cheery, but expect to walk away liking it.  The DVD features on Disc 2 (4 commentaries on Disc 1) are really worthwhile, with deleted scenes that look to be remastered, explorations of title concepts, an original opening and ending, and also some segments about the remastering for DVD.  This movie is worth it for fans of crime/thriller/horror movies, even though it's not really a horror movie, but it exibits some traits.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|Just some more friendly advice from the Observant Hermit Crab:  Do yourself a favor and watch the T.V. series Firefly before you watch this movie.  Otherwise, I think you will be lost within the first ten minutes.  Peace be with you always!

I thought that there were too many pages that only had one post card on them when it could fit at least two, preferably four.  The pages were sized to fit more than one image because on the pages that only had a single card, the words and drawings had the tell-tale jagged edges from being blown up tooooooo big.  I'm really suprised that someone didn't catch this before printing them that way.  It just doesn't look good.  From a design point of view, it looks more varied, I suppose, but I just see wasted space where I could have viewed several more cards!  Nevertheless, I loved the book (obviously, or I wouldn't be complaining about not seeing more postcards) and am waiting for PostSecret II.  However, if there is ever another PostSecret book PLEASE don't waste the space.  From a design point of view . . . try a collage type layout or something . . . anything other than blowing postcards up so big they lose their clarity!
B00006RINF|4.0|Surely there have been a lot of fans who have already said this, but don't think of Lacuna Coil as another Evanescence. You can make some comparisons, but there are far more differences. Granted, both bands have a rather cute female singer, but Lacuna Coil are quite a bit heavier, less poppy, and more gothic band than Amy Lee and Co. Plus, LC are a foreign band with two singers, and have been around for a quite a bit longer than Evanescence.  <br /> <br />With that out of the way, \\"Comalies,\\" Lacuna Coil's third and breakthrough album, is a very solid disc from a very promising band. Cristina sometimes croons (as in \\"The Ghost Woman And The Hunter\\" and the title track), but she usually chooses to showcase her angelic voice by singing in a tone which is louder, but also stronger and more effective.  <br /> <br />The C.D. opens with both of the band's hit singles. On the rhythmic album opener, \\"Swamped,\\" both of the singers take turns wailing over chug and churn guitars. Track two, \\"Heaven's A Lie,\\" is just as catchy. Other highlights include the choir-like backing vocals on \\"Daylight Dancer\\" and \\"Hurricane,\\" the crunchy, churning \\"Self Deception,\\" and \\"Entwined,\\" which has nice, soaring melodies. <br /> <br />In conclusion, as stated before, Lacuna Coil is a very promising band which you definitely need to know about and check out. They are definitely on their way up, and it's about time they had a breakthrough album. Who knows what tomorrow will bring their way, but if they keep making music of this quality, then the future is definitely bright for them (and their fans).
B000067FP8|4.0|In this entertaining sequel to Gremlins, Billy Peltzer and Kate Beringer have moved to New York where they work for Clamp Enterprises in a high tech office building.  When his owner dies, lovable Gizmo is taken prisoner and held in a Laboratory in the Clamp office building. When Billy finds out, he rescues Gizmo and hides him in a filing cabinet in his cubicle until he can take him home. Of course, it doesn't take long before two of the three rules about Gremlins are broken: Gizmo gets wet and spawns lots of little Gremlins who quickly find a way to eat after Midnight. Soon the Gremlins take over the office building and threaten to take over New York. Once again it's up to Billy, Kate, and Gizmo to stop them.<br /><br />This is a thoroughly enjoyable sequel. While the original was a dark and at times violent comedy, this is a straight out comedy which spoofs everything from the Wizard of Oz to Rambo to the first Gremlins movie itself. Daniel Clamp, owner of Clamp Enterprises, is a funny takeoff on Donald Trump. The fully automated office building is a hoot and even funnier when the Gremlins wreak havoc with it. There are so many jokes and sight gags in the movie that you can watch it over and over again and still see things that you missed before. Even some of the extras on the DVD are spoofs; the behind the scenes documentary is especially funny.<br /><br />The actors are all wonderful, especially Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates as Billy and Kate. Dick Miller returns as Mr. Futterman, still shaky with his first encounter with the Gremlins (who actually killed him in the first movie), but willing to fight them. John Glover nails the part of Daniel Clamp. All the actors seem to be having fun in the movie, which makes it even more enjoyable.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I've yet to see a single episode of the 'Firefly' television series but I will soon now that I've seen 'Serenity.' Plain and simple, this is a wonderfully enjoyable sci-fi, action/adventure film. It has everything you could ask for, intelligent plot, strong chemistry between cast members, excellent special effects, great fight sequences with that blithe little dynamo River (Summer Glau) and lots of cannibalistic zombie-like creatures called Reavers to keep you on your toes. Add to the mix the very sexy Inara (Morena Baccarin) and you've got a big hit on your hands.<br /><br />The cast also includes: Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Adam Baldwin, Jewel Staite (my personal favorite), Sean Maher, Chiwetel Ejiofor and David Krumholtz as Mr. Universe.<br /><br />All and all great fun to be had in front of the T.V. set. So get your popcorn and soft drink and you're good to go!
B00003OSTQ|5.0|Perhaps the main characteristic of this brilliant script is its overarching cynicism. The above reviews -- fawning in their praise for the script, the director, and the acting -- reveal what the writer knew about his audience.  They -- you -- are gullible.  Some reviewers are less so.  They observed how the entire script involves passages that are beyond believable.  And so it is -- unbelievable.   One is not taken in so much as put to the side, wondering \\"Who can believe this crap?\\" <br /> <br />Which is exactly as the writer intended. Too dark, too stereoptyped, too one-dimensional, too good to be true.  It can't be true.  Yet television news has devolved closer to this send-up than anyone else predicted.  The almighty dollar, alarmist political ideology, and sheer egoism have stripped network news of its stature. It is hollow, grasping, easily deflated, ugly.   <br /> <br />Even the unedited blogosphere, with all its flaws, surpasses network and cable news in immediacy, depth, and usefulness. The real wonder is that network news thrives at all. Studies in human engineering show this to be due to the declining knowledge and education of the public as schools dumb-down their curricula to match multicultural and multi-language goals, and political correctness supplants tough love as the cornerstone of humanitariansm. The brilliance of the script is in how it shows that unprincipled humanitarianism leads to intellectual cannabalism - the worst self-defeat of all. <br /> <br />A magnificent movie that shows the flaws inherent in the commercialization of the media -- making it a pawn of capitalism while simultaneously denouncing itself.  The self-inflicted wounds are the seeds of its mounting irrelevance. <br /> <br />A wonderful movie, almost evil; but only because of its dark truths.
B000001FS3|5.0|Fans of U2 will argue about which album is their finest release. For the early fans, many will say their debut, \\"Boy\\" or third release, \\"War\\" present U2 at their youthful splendor and raw energy. Later fans will argue that \\"Achtung Baby\\" defined and epitomized modern-rock for the 1990s. Newer fans can make a valid argument that \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" or \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" redefined U2 for the new millennium and expanded their audience. In fact, all these arguments are true. However, \\"Joshua Tree\\" is, in my humble opinion, U2's finest work that actually ties all the different faces, sounds, and textures of \\"old U2\\" and \\"new U2\\" together.<br /><br />I recall first discovering this album has a high school freshman in 1988 (a year after its initial release). Almost 18 years later, this album sounds as fresh and exciting, heartfelt and magical, tragic and joyful as it did then. There aren't many rock and roll albums that stand the test of time nearly two decades after its initial release and still sound wonderful and fresh (there are exceptions, such as \\"Exile on Main St\\" and \\"Who's Next\\", to quickly name a few). How many other albums from decade that brought us hair bands and synthesizers can you claim sound \\"timeless\\"? Not many if any - but \\"Joshua Tree\\" meets that acid test.<br /><br />From the opening chords of \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\", to the darkness of \\"With or Without You\\", to the sadness and despair of \\"Mother of the Disappeared\\", the \\"Joshua Tree\\" remains an all-time classic for any rock and roll and U2 fan. Beyond the hit singles, the album is a compelling listen that captivates the listener from start to finish. In this album, you can hear both the influences of the \\"old U2\\" as well as the \\"new U2\\" they were yet to become at the time of this recording. This is a masterpiece that both old and new fans of U2 must own!
B00005JO04|4.0|Syriana is a good but complicated film directed by Stephen Gaghan (writer of Traffic) and starring Ocean's Eleven stars George Clooney and Matt Damon, Christopher Plummer (The Sound Of Music), and Chris Cooper (American Beauty).    The movie focuses on America's oil interests in the Middle East, and how 'America' with its manipulations, CIA operatives, and foreign agents is able to control the flow of oil in the world.    An Arabian Gulf prince, played by Alexander Siddig, whose country is not specifically named, is interested in taking over as king after his ailing father dies so he can develop his country into a powerful economic force with open trade with countries like China, something he knows will disappoint America and Europe. His father, as a result of pressure from the west, chooses his youngest son, a spoiled prince with only money on his mind, as his follower to the throne. Matt Damon plays the prince's economic advisor who believes in his client's ambitions and realizes that he can get richer as his permanent consultant despite going through a family tragedy where his son dies and his wife leaves him to return to America.    In another corner in the globe, George Clooney is a CIA operative who discovers he's being used by his government for risky operations, such as a trip to Lebanon to assassinate the ambitious prince, which leads him to a torture chamber where his nails are pulled out with pliers.    In the meantime, an oil drilling company has shut down and is sold to another American firm which leads to the unemployment of a number of foreign workers mainly from Pakistan. Two youths, who were amongst those fired, are lured in becoming suicide bombers. Their target: the same big company that took them out of work.    What the different events in the movie lead to in the end is one conclusion: that America only cares for itself; that it is the reason why everything that is viewed as evil to the world is happening, while the victims are those that are used and abused by the system of American foreign policy; and that it will get its way and what it wants no matter what.    Syriana is a risky Hollywood feature; a very interesting movie with a brand new theme in modern day cinema. The acting and screenplay, which will most definitely be nominated for the Best Original Screenplay oscar, makes the movie pass by at easy pace for the viewers. Clooney's performance is captivating, and worthy of an Oscar nomination. While the performances of Damon, Plummer, Cooper and even Amanda Peets and Alexander Siddig are excellent secondary role players; expect to have a couple of Supporting Actor nominations also.     The movie is not for everyone. I am sure that many people will fall asleep or become restless by the end of the movie. But it will provoke you to think about it for a long time. This is why I recommend it only to those who like the 'thinking' movies.    B
B0000AQS0F|5.0|\\"Firefly\\"... What does that word bring to mind? For some, nothing, or maybe at most some kind of bug with a beautiful name... For a few, like me and maybe you, \\"Firefly\\" is a great though somewhat weird show that was untimely cancelled by Fox. We were robbed of the opportunity of watching that show, but at least we enjoyed it while it was on air, so I think that we were the lucky ones...<br /><br />Fortunately, this dvd allows everybody to be a winner, in the sense that if you lost the opportunity of watching the series, you can do it now, and if you already watched and loved the series, you can watch it again as many times as you want.<br /><br />Should I tell you something about the series, in case you are completely clueless regarding \\"Firefly\\"? Well, \\"Firefly\\" is a sci-fi Western produced by Joss Whedon, the person behind \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" and \\"Angel\\". The series is set in the future, and it tells the story of a group of rebels that oppose the Alliance, a dictatorial government. These rebels live in a ship, the \\"Serenity\\", and their leader is Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion), a former officer in a war against the Alliance that his side lost. We also have Zoe (Mal's second officer, played by Gina Torres) and her husband 'Wash' Washburne (a pilot, played by Alan Tudyk). We cannot forget the utterly unlikable Jayne (Adam Baldwin), Kaylee(a mechanic and an eternal optimist, played by Jewel Staite), Shepherd Book (Ron Glass), Inara (Morena Baccarin), Simon Tam (a doctor, played by Sean Maher) and his sister River (Summer Glau), a psychic on whom the Alliance experimented before she managed to escape.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this series is pure, unadulterated fun that was cut short for thousands due to the fact that it was cancelled when merely 11 of the 14 episodes this dvd contains had been aired. I suppose that the fact that Fox is behind the release of dvd could be seen as some kind of atonement for the cancellation of the show, I don't know. In any case, I am pretty sure that more people will become fans of \\"Firefly\\" after watching this dvd, and that won't hurt the chances that the show has of returning to the small screen.<br /><br />Finally, I would like to highlight the fact that the bonus features that \\"Firefly\\" offers are great, but what really completes this dvd is another one, \\"Serenity\\". \\"Serenity\\", now available in dvd format, is an excellent film directed by Joss Whedon and based on the \\"Firefly\\" series, that provides it with an interesting ending. If you can, purchase both \\"Firefly\\" and \\"Serenity\\" at the same time. You won't regret it, and you will save some time  :)<br /><br />Belen Alcatany case, I am pretty sure that more people will become fans of \\"Firefly\\" after watching this dvd, and that won't hurt the chances that the show has of returning to the small screen. <br /> <br />Finally, I would like to highlight the fact that the bonus features that \\"Firefly\\" offers are great, but what really completes this dvd is another one, \\"Serenity\\". \\"Serenity\\", now available in dvd format, is an excellent film directed by Joss Whedon and based on the \\"Firefly\\" series, that provides it with an interesting ending.

B0000025RI|5.0|I love this album! I remember getting this for the first time 10 years ago and I listen to it many, many times. It's such a fun album to listen to and brings back many memories. My dad have this album too actually. Please take me back to the old days....please, please, please. I don't care whether people think this album is overrated, his worst, or they like his other albums better. Thriller will always be a very special album and era. His best ever. That one album where I can listen to it from start to finish.<br /><br />1. Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'-5/5 I love this song...the beats are very catchy to dance too.<br /><br />2. Baby Be Mine- 5/5 my memories feel bittersweet with this one. it's a very casual but nice to dance to. it's very early 80ish.<br /><br />3. The Girl Is Mine  5/5 I love this song. It's very down-to-earth. Great duet with Paul McCartney. Some people think this song is cheesy.<br /><br />4. Thriller- 5/5 The song that started it all....the video scares me, though<br /><br />5. Beat It- 5/5 One song I could never forget!<br /><br />6. Billie Jean- 5/5 The song that Michael moonwalked to. The video is very mysterious.<br /><br />7. Human Nature- 6/5 OMG! I love this song!!! It's the best one on this album. I remember hearing on the radio inside my mom's car.<br /><br />8. P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing- 6/5...I love this song too!<br /><br />9. The Lady In My Life -5/5 I remember hearing this song. How romantic.<br /><br />It's such a pity!

0062515675|5.0|A beautiful book very well narrated and written.  A great inspiring book for all those people who needs a change in life.  Sometimes our insecurities and fear of future curtails us from taking certain decisions in life.  But at the same time,  certain circumstances forces you to make the change and this is a fable of a man who had a chance to make the change.<br /><br />I think some of the jokes fall flat with a great topic in discussion.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|When I put \\"TRY\\" into the CD player it is physically impossible for me to sit still. The music on this CD moves you. I'm not going to waste any time trying to defend John's music to those who don't like his voice, or the comparisons to SRV - but I will take some time to share what a gift he does have. First and foremost - when TRY is pouring out of your speakers you will notice the incredible MUSIC first. As a huge John Mayer fan - I always enjoyed his voice - but it is the music on this CD that thrills me each and every time I push play. The sound is heavy, layered, and holds such a groove. My personal favorites include \\"Love is On the Way\\" and \\"Vultures\\". John takes these songs and me with him on a journey. When I'm driving in my car I forget where I am and where I am going - I am simply lost in the music. Secondly - although without the rougher tone of some blues singers - Mayer's voice has a new edge with this new set of songs. A fine example is the song Vultures...Mayer's voice shines here related to range and key. Full of soul and heart - John's voice is all it should be on what is tagged as a \\"blues\\" album.  <br /> <br />I caught some on-lookers in other vehicles staring at me this morning on my drive to work because of the manner in which I was grooving out to his CD. The best part is that I could care less - TRY makes me happy - relaxed - and excited for more from JM3. I know that all those who were staring were thinking - \\"Man..I need what she's got!\\". If you know what is good for you - you'll grab this one soon...
B00005JOFO|5.0|Brokeback Mountain is a rare film that can offer you a different experience each time you see it -- it's good the first time, but amazing the second. That's usually when people who didn't get the fuss \\"get\\" it. Like me.<br /><br />It's easy to miss a lot the first time. There is almost nothing on-the-nose in this film. Most of the emotion and story is found between the lines, unfolding almost like a mystery. (E.g., it's difficult to catch the profound significance of the two shirts -- and the order they're hung in -- upon the first viewing. Paying closer attention on second viewing reveals a great deal of importance that happened off screen, and changes how you interpret various scenes.)<br /><br />One doesn't usually expect such subtle intricacies that require multiple viewings from a drama/romance, but the revelations and new understandings you do get from a second or even third viewing of Brokeback are greatly rewarding. This is partly because of the tremendous nuance in the story & performances, and partly because of the clever order in which things are revealed. Because so much is masked and unspoken among the characters, the whole truth or underlying emotion of many moments are veiled from us until long afterward. I strongly recommend seeing it again.<br /><br />When in the theaters, some folks praised or panned Brokeback merely for its subject matter, but both agendas belittle the greatness and scope of the film. It's an expertly told and gorgeously shot subtle drama about the irrepressible power of both love and fear. I'd say it's also about the clash of idealism vs. rigidity, responsibility vs. desire, and deep passion vs. a particularly masculine inability to express emotion.<br /><br />Heath Ledger's aching performance is mesmerizing. The New York Times rightly compared it to the best of Brando and Penn. There's more brewing beneath the surface in his Ennis del Mar than we'll ever truly know -- and that restraint is what allows us to discover new layers each time we see the film. It's as if he capped a volcano and never lets more than a wisp of steam out here and there, yet we can sense the smoldering in the depths. Few lead actors have evoked so much with so few words -- and at times so little of his face, as Ennis likes to hide his eyes beneath the safe brim of his hat, making his direct glances all the more potent. Add to that the subtle ways his voice and body change as he ages 20 years, and you have a performance that I suspect will go down in film history as one of the greats.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal, whose Jack Twist is a little less hidden, also delivers a stellar performance of alternately bottled up pathos and spurts of idealism. Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway shine equally bright as Alma and Lureen. Hathaway's transformation from spunky young rodeo barrel racer to 40 year old Texas businesswoman shuttering her emotions behind a stoic veil is gut-wrenching.<br /><br />Not a false beat exists in this movie. Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana have so faithfully adapted and artfully expanded Proulx's story in their Oscar-winning screenplay that Proulx said she felt like they (and the other filmmakers) had reached inside her head.<br /><br />The Oscar-winning score by Gustavo Santaollala (whose score for 2004's The Motorcycle Diaries is another of my favorites) is appropriately spare, haunting, and beautifully evocative. He packs more emotional punch with a single guitar than another composer could have with the London Phil. I do wish it were longer, but it's all the film needed and is definitely worth getting once you've seen the movie. Brings it all back.<br /><br />Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is gorgeous, from the breathtaking mountain expanses to the muted indoor scenes wherein the light is as simple and evocative as the story. Prieto is as gifted with natural (or natural-seeming) light as the great Rodger Deakins. Judy Becker's production design is so dead-on it's hard to imagine it's not all real.<br /><br />I cannot think of a recent drama that has held me in its grip quite like Brokeback Mountain has. Like Proulx's original story, the film powerfully knocked me out of my own life and has haunted me since.<br /><br />However... it's hard not to let all the praise lead to overblown expectations. As well done as it is, it's ultimately just a simple tale about a handful of average folks struggling with their emotions. Because it avoids an easy and false catharsis, it can leave you wanting more. Which is another reason that a second or third viewing is more powerfully moving than the first. It does not easily let you go when it's over.<br /><br />What greater wish could a film lover have? The personal impact of Brokeback Mountain on me was that it made me treasure love more.<br /><br />In a year of some great contenders, Brokeback Mountain still stands out to me as the best film of 2005 -- the one that will probably last with me the longest. For what it's worth, it won more Best Picture awards in 2005 than any film in cinema history, and was the best-reviewed film of the year, on more Top 10 lists and rating #1 on more lists than any other American film.rip quite like Brokeback Mountain has.

0688170528|5.0|This book had me from the beginning.  It has been a really long time since I have been able to really get into a book... could be that I have two children who consume my every second, lol.  This was given to me by a friend and was the first of Jodi's books I have ever read, but it won't be the last.  The Pact is so well written and full of suspense and there were times that I even cried reading this.  She has a way of really gripping your attention and your heart.  Her characters really come to life.  This book hit really close to home for me, knowing someone who is serving time for a crime they didn't commit.  I am telling you right now if you don't read this book you will regret it.  I couldn't put it down.  I was reading it at the gym, in the bath, and during commercial breaks of my favorite shows.  It really is an awesome book. Don't pass it up.

B000AP04FG|1.0|The tabloid press on this thing kind of gave one the impression there was something going on in this movie.<br /><br />There isn't.  By far, Brad Pitt's worst movie ever.  Angelina, well, has she done a good movie? Except for maybe that one with the air traffic controller theme?<br /><br />Basically, the premise seems to be a War of the Roses taken to the next level: assassins who meet, fall in love, and marry, both without any knowledge of the others' avocation, get bored, seek marriage counseling, then discover the others' profession.  The girl seems to be the head of some kind of sappho cult.  The man, part of the CIA.<br /><br />From imdb.com, I count FIVE producers, one associate producer, one executive producer, one co producer.  Most of ho-hum crap.  Like \\"DareDevil\\".  Or the uniforms-fresh-from-the-cleaners' \\"We Were Soldiers\\".  Or \\"Elektra.\\"  Plus a whole bunch of movies we will never hear of.<br /><br />Soundtrack: hip-hop nonsense similar to the first couple of the Brosnan Bonds, which totally ruined them.<br /><br />Free advice for any superstars looking for a vehicle, RUN, don't walk, from any project with > 1 producer.<br /><br />This movie, for the audience--stay away.
B0000035E7|4.0|This album was the very first of their hard hitting CDs. In my opinion, it is the most raw of their 3 \\"official\\" albums.              ~SONGS~     01. Blew- A very good song, one of my favorite tracks.     02. Floyd the Barber- Another excellent song, my favorite. Listen to the lyrics, funny and catchy     03. About a Girl- Not nearly as good as the other songs because the others are more \\"grungish\\".     04. School- A fun and energetic song     05. Love Buzz- Like About a Girl, I dont like it that much     06. Paper Cuts- An averagly good song     07. Negetive Creep-  Probably my 3rd favorite track, really hard     08. Scoff- It has a nice drum opening and very catchy.     09. Swap Meet- I dont really like this song, but listen to it on an occasion     10. Mr Moustache- I like it equally to Negetive Creep     11.

B00005JOGU|5.0|If Philip Seymour Hoffman does not get the Academy Award for Best Actor, then the thinking of the Academy is seriously off base. Having seen Mr. Hoffman in a number of other films, to watch him do Truman Capote here was more than a revelation--it was breathtaking.<br /><br />It was absolutely Mr. Hoffman channeling Truman Capote. No other description does his performance justice. THIS is the mark of acting that transcends being even great--it is astounding. If you saw him as the doofy slob boyfriend of Hope Davis in \\"Next Stop Wonderland\\", nothing will prepare you for his performance here. Even if you saw him as the gay neighbor of Robert DeNiro in \\"Flawless\\"--even that is a trace of the brilliance that bursts on the screen here in \\"Capote\\".<br /><br />He forges a relationship with convicted mass murderer Perry Smith that is heartbreaking and more emotionally powerful than any conventional love story has portrayed a relationship in many years on screen. Then he can turn right around and exchange bon mots at a cocktail party and be completely convincing as a quick-witted social butterfly with a sly biting sense of humor.<br /><br />I have to confess that I was riveted to the screen. Catherine Keener was also really good, as was Chris Cooper and Bob Balaban and Bruce Greenwood and the actor playing Perry Smith (in fact, the latter was excellent). But this is really Hoffman's film. I think you can tell that he knows he had great material to work with; the screenwriter, Dan Futterman, did a tremendous job of conveying Capote's personality in cinematic form and Hoffman takes maximum advantage of that terrific script by nailing the character from the get-go.<br /><br />Right from the start we can see this is no ordinary character--it's not just that Capote is gay; he's also extremely intelligent and spoiled and at the same time extremely emotionally sensitive.

B00003CXXP|4.0|Steven Spielberg's sci fi mega movie from 2001, is a time traveling, bumpy carpet ride of exciting and profound entertainment, combining a boy's wondrous adventure, albeit an 'artificial' boy, with meticulous film construction of inspired images of the near and far future. From the sterile and precise modern suburban culture of the near future at the film's onset, to the carnival holocaust, spectator sport extermination of artificial beings in the film's most striking, and emotionally riveting scene, and the towering decadence of a destroyed New York City towards the film's end, and finally, to the very fringes of time itself, (as in Kubrick's \\"2001\\"), \\"A.I.\\" paints an astounding canvas of a likely tomorrow.<br /><br />Its conclusion, however, so absolute that one expects an almighty god to enter the picture and wrap things up, seems elongated and not entirely focused, as if Spielberg had many endings to choose from, and decided on them all. Other problems weigh in. Our hero's infatuation for The Blue Fairy, from \\"Pinocchio\\", and the love of 'mother', are crossed swords, where one super maternal figure would suffice, and the boy's last wishful fantasy come true, a very human desire, seems much less than the milestone, (or light year), one expects him to cross. The beginning too, a platform discussion on the ethics of biological tampering, is a fistful contrivance. Still, it's the journey, not so much the destination. that makes \\"A.I.\\" so appealing, and once the robotic Pinocchio, who only wishes to be a real boy, is set on his way, through the door of a couple who adopt an artificial boy, there is no stopping the film's childlike wonder, adventurous spirit, and mature thought provoking insight. I really felt the desperation of the 'artificials' being threatened with extermination in the carnival concentration camp, (The Flesh Fair). Speilberg's subtle characterizations of human want and need, particularly in the artificial junk rummage scene, with humanoids pilfering for needed body parts, makes these pathetic unfortunates soar with humane value. Haley Joel Osment, who always spooked me before, as an unfortunately gifted child actor, is masterful at creating a robotic, spiritualized protagonist with a heart of tin. The special effects are excellent, maybe the best I've ever seen, and the credits include Meryl Streep and Ben Kingsley in cameo roles.<br /><br />Some tweaks here and there aside, this is \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" of the modern era.ing for needed body parts, makes these pathetic unfortunates soar with humane value.

B000BOH8XW|4.0|Shakira is one of my favourite artist to ever grace the earth.  she is a natural performer that shows that she can handle being with the big dogs. she has had career triumphs (2001's brilliant LAUNDRY SERVICE & 2005's FIJACION ORAL vol. 1). but it would be wrong if i compared ORAL FIXATION vol. 2 to its predessors. this album is not a banger but it does have joints to bob your head to. <br /> <br />'how do you do', 'timor', 'illegal' w/ carlos santana, & 'costume makes the clowm' are my favourite songs on the album. each had a distinct taste that pleases the ear. <br /> <br />the only song i think is not right for the album was 'don't bother'. this song in particular is not a instant smash that catches me fast enough.  its a great track but it took me a while to appreciate it.  also 'animal city' is kind of a lackluster.  <br /> <br />this album is not a complete smash like her last three albums but this one has just enough pop to keep you interested. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 5 stars: the album cover is a plus as well
B000000H4V|5.0|When you listen to this CD, you have to be much more open minded and think of it as a metal record that breaks all the boundries. I don't ever think a trash metal band (some call Sepultura death metal, but I dont agree) no, In fact I know that no other trash metal band has ever experimented with tribal drumming and guitar playing on a metal record. For those that dont know, Sepultura is from Brazil, in which Tribal music is not only popular but a part of culture. Sepultrua took this type of music and blended into this album which is astonshing. Even though I am somewhat happy with the reviews on this, I am dissapointed that it gets a comparison to Helmet and the Cro Mags, as one reviewer pointed out. Listen, I like both bands, and many others if you have read my reviews before, along with many types of music, but Sepultura cannot be compared to anyone with this album. If you a fan of metal, and what to hear something unique and different this is a must have. Be warned, it isnt as heavy as older Sepultra albums, but I believe to be much different. If you like Soulfly, you might like this also, but Soulfly in my opinion is no where as powerful as Sepultra was (hey without Max and Igor playing together it will never be the same) ENJOY
B00082IJ08|5.0|Gorillaz, the first Gorillaz CD, was a perfect CD. It was innovative, with so many different sounds and styles blending together; it had hard rock, rap, alternative, and plenty of other stuff.<br /><br />Demons Days, thankfully, kept true to it predecessor by keeping that same style. This is a perfect sequel to a perfect CD. Nothing can be said negative about this CD, other than it isn't as long as Gorillaz. After that, though, the content is much more varied and stylistic than the first, with songs that have meaning as well as the chaos that goes with listening to the Gorillaz. It takes time to find the meanings, but when you do there will be some gratification. And the title, whether it was intentional or not, goes so well with the times. It doesn't have anything to do with demons, either, so all you parents out there can stop looking at your children as if they are devil worshippers.<br /><br />There are plenty of standout tracks on this CD, but the showcase songs are Feel Good Inc., Dirty Harry, Dare, and the title song Demon Days. Feel Good Inc. is a mixture of rap and alternative, and is the first single on the CD. Dirty Harry is the song that has a great deal of meaning dealing with the times we live in the war going on, following an alternative/rap style, but with a great chorus backing that fades in slowly. Dare is a dance song, plain and simple, with a techno beat that sounds great when played loud. Demon Days, the true oddball here, is an orchestral song with tambourines in the background and great lyrics. Following I've listed the entire track selection, and my personal starred rating of each song:<br /><br />1. Intro: ** (Gets you into a mood but is short and not in actuality a song)<br /><br />2. Last Living Souls: **** (Good opening song with a simple, addictive beat)<br /><br />3. Kids with Guns: **** (Another simple beat, but this song has a profound title that is eye-catching)<br /><br />4. O Green World: *** (Plucked electric guitars, as well as a techno beat that comes in and alternative-styled lyrics)<br /><br />5. Dirty Harry: *****<br /><br />6. Feel Good Inc.: *****<br /><br />7. El Manana: **** (slow lyrics and a soft techno sound)<br /><br />8. Every Planet We Reach is Dead: **** (electric guitars and a keyboard open this song with slowly sung lyrics)<br /><br />9. November Has Come: **** (rap with a good base-thumping beat, as well as a decent chorus line)<br /><br />10. All Alone: **** (probably the fifth best song on the CD, with a techno sound and odd lyrics and a rap)<br /><br />11. White Light: *** (hard rock with a harsh drum beat, the only song I skip when listening, next to the intro, though it isn't bad)<br /><br />12. Dare: *****<br /><br />13. Fire Coming Out of the Monkey's Head: **** (a story song with a humming chorus and steady beat)<br /><br />14. Don't Get Lost: **** (Orchestral like Demon Days, and in many ways a prelude to the final track)<br /><br />15. Demon Days: *****<br /><br />I'd recommend Demon Days to any anyone who likes a different style to their music, and definitely to Gorillaz fans, as it is their best and promises a great future for this odd group of cartoon characters.at comes in and alternative-styled lyrics)  <br />5.

B000BT97AO|5.0|Other reviewers have compared this to Labyrinth and Dark Crystal, but this truly stands on its own.  Dark and moody, twisting and full of atmosphere, you can see Neil Gaiman's hand on this story.  A must for fans of Gaiman's darker works (Sandman, Neverwhere, American Gods), but a great pic for those not familiar with his work.  Great story, clever ending, decent acting.  Better than about 98% of what came out in 2005.
B000BCKFWK|4.0|I found this a very difficult movie to rate. I wanted so badly to give it a five because of the movie itself, but I also wanted to give the Unrated edition a three for the package, as it is very disappointing. So, I settled on a solid four. Here's why.<br /><br />Firstly, Sin City as a movie alone was excellent. It was innovative and almost as good as my absolute favorite movie Pulp Fiction, and this I believe is because the two are so much alike. Sin City doesn't even try to explain itself. The characters ramble on in moments of deep thought, revealing what makes them tick. It's filled to the brim with Arnold-esque one-liners. The surreal style of this film makes all the characters seem like super heroes of sorts (not strange, considering Frank Miller, the god of American comics, created this series). In fact, everything that happens in this movie would make other movies bad. Who wants to listen to the thoughts of a character, something that's usually left in books? Yet in Sin City it words. Who still likes Arnold one-liners, what with all those Arnold impressions going on anymore? Obviously, Frank Miller, and so do his fans. Who wants surrealism in their movies? Anyone who likes super hero movies, which record tells a lot of people. All this comes together to make Sin City the all-time greatest comic-book movie.<br /><br />Now, for the Sin City Uncut edition, the only true bonus here is the graphic novel, which I have yet to read myself (review coming later). It gives you the chance to see just how innovative the movie Sin City is, and how true the directors wanted to keep the movie to the book. After that, there is little to keep my interest. Some of the special features found here should have been included in the first edition of Sin City, which I foolishly wasted my money on not knowing this edition was coming. Plus, unless you watch both versions of the movie back to back, you'll never be able to tell which scenes were added. The breakdown of stories so that you can watch them singularly doesn't add anything. It's jarring, actually, since it breaks the rhythm the original version followed.<br /><br />In the end, I can't recommend this movie to anyone who has the original version. If you don't have that version, however, pick this up quick. It is still a superior version, only not by much.at you can watch them singularly doesn't add anything.

B000BUYP4Q|1.0|First things first. Batman Begins the movie rules. Great cast. Great director. More than makes up for the dreck that Joel Schlockmaker did with the series. I loved it. Why the one star, you ask? Because the the two-disc special edition I received as a gift, that was ordered through Amazon, has two major flaws. First, the second disc (the extras disc) doesn't load at all. Not on my DVD player, not on my PS2, not on my PC. I get the FBI warning, the Warner Brothers logo, then squat. Second, it didn't come with the special 72-page book that I heard so much about. All I got in mine was the obligatory Warner Brothers catalog of Batman Begins merchandise ($125 for a sterling silver Batmobile keychain???) and a Batman Begins branded flyer for Norton Antivirus (don't ask...I didn't even give it a second glance). That's it. Tomorrow I begin the process of trying to get Amazon to replace it. If it goes well, I'll update this review accordingly.
B000000ORX|5.0|Like many reviewers have pointed out before, this record is very underrated. The songs are lyrically complex and musically simple, but in a very good way. I also noticed in many other reviews that people continuously pointed out \\"Two Grey Rooms\\" as being one of her greatest songs ever, and I'd definietly agree. It's such a beautiful and elegant song, the whole album is just very elegant and classy. \\"Night Ride Home\\" is simply wonderful!
B00005JO9J|5.0|This is by far my favorite show on TV.  It's got an incredible cast and it's amazingly witty.  The writing is tremendous and you can't help but enjoy this show.  (Unless Big Brother or Tru Calling were your top picks...then you may not be a big fan of this really sharp, intelligent show.)
0446577383|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book; it's supposed to be a page turner, not a political science book or a history book.  It was a page turner for me and I really enjoyed \\"Oliver Stone\\".
B0009HLDFU|1.0|Copy protected means you cannot add to your IPOD!!!! <br /> <br />Regardless of how much I like the Foo Fighters or this CD (which, in fact, is mediocre), I can't add it to my Ipod and simply put the CD away. <br /> <br />It all boils down to a simple question, do I like this CD more than I like the convince of an Ipod?  The answer is an resounding NO! <br /> <br />Send a message to the band and the music company that thinks that they can control what users want and the marketplace and DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM. <br />
B000BKVQTS|5.0|Many of these reviews are hard on this film, I thought it was great. I was constantly looking for references to various fairy tales, there were so many that I'm sure I missed some. The enchanted forest wasfabulously designed, and the film's humor is great. It's not a drama or action film, as I'm sure many people would expect, it's more of a comedy, and myself and those I watched it with all found it to be excellent. I rented it, but I'm considering adding it to my collection.
0740748475|5.0|Brilliant! Worth three times its wheight in gold this magical collection of calvin and hobbes will put smiles on the faces of generations to come.

With his goofy characters and amazing artwork Bill Watterson has made sure that this comic will live foreever.
B0002IQHY8|4.0|While this CD is a good CD, it is nothing like the excellent Parsons albums of the past.  This CD is worse than every classic Parsons except for Ammonia Avenue, although it is better than On Air, Try Anything Once, and The Time Machine. <br /> <br />The CD opens with a magnificent instrumental, Return To Tunguska.  This song took me five to ten listens to fully appreciate, but I would now rate it as the best song on the album.  More Lost Without You follows, and while it is not nearly as good as the preceding song, I still pull it out every so often. <br /> <br />Mammagamma 04 is the first and worst of the two remakes on the CD.  While it is a good song on its own, it pales in comparison to the original.  We Play the Game is the worst song on the album, although it is not bad.  It is merely OK.  Tijuanic is a decent instrumental, as is L'Arc en Ciel, but Parsons has done better than both. <br /> <br />Following this comes the second remake of the album.  A Recurring Dream Within a Dream, unlike Mammagamma 04, waltzes all over the original (the Raven) from Tales of Mystery and Imagination.  The quote from A Dream Within a Dream greatly enhances the song, as does the music preceding the lyrics from The Raven. <br /> <br />You Can Run is highighted by the lyric \\"Ain't nothing human 'bout the human race,\\" which, apart from appearing in the song, is what the voice is saying at the very beginning and end of the song.  Being a cynicist, this is exactly my sentiment about humans.  Otherwise, this song is about as good as We Play the Game.  The CD ends with the instrumental Chomolungma, which is good until the bonus stuff in the final minute, which takes away from the song. <br /> <br />Overall, a good album, but not a Project-type good album.
B000BVD460|3.0|Eminem is probally the biggest influence of my generation (just threw up a little) through his stuff and 50 cent and ok even though i'm a classic rock fan and should hate this stuff I saw talent when I saw it first time I herd eminem was the real slim shady which is a good song maby even a classic of our time ok big maby. Stan is good as well as the way I am. My name is, is even pretty good i'm actually a little sad that they left out role model that was even better then my name. Then we come to D12 which was completely left out please don't tell me there's gonna be a D12 best it's not worth it purple pills is like the real slim shady and fight music is like the way I am. Now eminem is well known and here come the eminem show with without me and at the same time a loss of his core fan bace he sold out plain and simple but to me it was like AC/DC back in black more mainstream but still good that album came out with a slew of hits that were all ok. Lose yourself from the 8 mile movie at one time my very favorite but it got over played still good lyrics. Now when I herd just lose it I just about threw up serious and everything off of that album except mosh not on here sucks ass. Now I haven't herd the new stuff and until I buy this I don't want to and even then probally not i'm uber happy he's done he should have stopped with the eminem show but oh well as for 50 cent well he just sucks what the hell was eminem thinking. <br />
B000002VCT|5.0|Pyramid was, for a long time, my favorite album, and What Goes Up... was, for a long time, my favorite song.  However, I Robot and Don't Let it Show have since taken those positions, respectively. <br /> <br />When I first listened to Pyramid, I gave all of the songs except for One More River five stars.  When I listened to Pyramid for a second time, What Goes Up... and Pyramania stayed at five, and the rest dropped down to four.  One More River stayed at three stars. <br /> <br />Voyager is a decent instrumental, but it doesn't get very interesting until it is fifteen seconds more than half over.  What Goes Up... is the first Parsons song I ever heard, and is pure bliss.  The Eagle Will Rise Again is a fitting ballad for the album.  One More River is the only disappointment on the album.  It just doesn't speak to me.  Can't Take it With You is another strong song.  In the Lap of the Gods is a good instrumental, but not among Parsons' best.  Pyramania is a very catchy song that is the closest thing to a title track the album has.  Once one gets past the silliness and frivolity that the song seems at first glance to emanate, it is possible to appreciate that Pyramania is the most unique Parsons song, and is actually a deep song about the spiritual powers of a pyramid.  Hyper-Gamma-Spaces completes a set of three decent, but not particularly excellent, instrumentals.  Shadow of a Lonely is a beautiful ballad about death, and a great end to the album, although the first fifty seconds of the song sound like they should be the last fifty seconds. <br /> <br />Still, a great album.  Highly recommended.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|(...) I didn't come here to hate on Madonna I don't need too.  Mariah Carey has 17 #1 Billboard Hot 100 Hit Singles tied with one of the Legends of Rock-n-Roll Elvis Presley.  Madonna fans write bad reviews everyday about Mariah Carey's album which has been nominated for 8 Grammy's, won 4 Billboard Music Awards and has put Mariah Carey back on top as the Best Artist of 2005.  In all these reviews they never once bring up any song on the album or anything about the album.  One review even said Mariah Carey's a bitch so get Madonna's Cofessions on a Dance Floor.  Personly after I heard Hung Up! I knew the people in the UK didn't know crap about Music.  Madonna's album is not even on the same level with the great albums this year.  Now I'm not going to be like those Madonna fans that say \\"Go buy a real album Confessions on a Dance Floor.\\"  No Mariah has over 4.5 million sold of The Emancipation of Mimi and it's get higher and higher.  You should already know that album is a must have of 2005.  No I suggest Mary J Blige.  Her new song is hot and she's doing it real big in 2006!  MJB!  That's the album you should buy.  Use Confession on a Dance Floor album as a coster!
B000002VCB|4.0|Eve is a slightly misogynistic album.  I'd Rather be a Man is a very misogynistic song. <br /> <br />Now that I have gotten the bad out of the way, I can focus on all of the good things I have to say about the first six tracks of the album.  The opener, Lucifer, has a simply amazing introduction (with all the beeping and stuff), and the other four minutes of the song are excellent as well.  Lucifer is, quite simply, not only the best instrumental by Parsons by far, but also the best instrumental I have ever heard (and a great juggling song, for that matter).  You Lie Down with Dogs is one of the first Parsons songs I was familiar with, and helped me to start becoming interested in Alan Parsons over the biting satire of Tom Lehrer.  I'd Rather be a Man is a very good song, and the last line takes me back to I Robot, my favorite Parsons album.  You Won't Be There is another good song.  Winding Me Up has a clever introduction, but doesn't live up to the introduction afterwords.  Still, it's not called living UP for nothing, and Winding Me Up is a good song.  Damned if I Do is an absolute masterpiece, and easily makes it into my top ten list for Parsons songs (instrumentals not included, or Lucifer would be there, too) <br /> <br />Unfortunately, after this point, the CD gets worse.  Don't Hold Back is the only Alan Parsons song that I have ever given a one star (not including the time I listened to the first ten seconds of the 36 Parsons songs I had and gave half of them only one star).  It is absolutely horrendous.  If the music were changed, and the concept was changed to Don't Hold ME Back, it would fit on the album and would be a song that could get a rating as high as four stars.  However, it does not fit on the album, the music is bad, the lyrics are bad, and it definitely is not worthy of more than one star. <br /> <br />Secret Garden looks really good coming after Don't Hold Back, but is still a very weak three star instrumental. <br /> <br />Before writing this review, I have been unable to rate If I Could Change Your Mind as I was unable to force myself to suffer throught the whole song.  At least ten times, I got one minute into the song and then realized that I owned 153 songs that I would rate as four stars or higher (Lucifer, You Lie Down With Dogs, I'd Rather be a Man, You Won't Be There, and Damned If I Do all from this CD), and that my time would be much better spent listening to them.  I finally forced myself to listen to the whole song while I edited this review, and I would have to give it weak two stars.  It isn't as bad as Don't Hold Back, but it isn't very good either. <br /> <br />Now that I have bashed two of the songs on the CD and criticized a third without having a good thing to say, it seems necessary that I make it clear that this is a great album, and is worth the cost if just for Lucifer and Damned if I Do.
B000BSXYJA|3.0|This is a fantastic concert, and is sure to please any music fan.  Some really apparent problems to me are:  <br />- the high amount of video compression used.  Several scences show blocks due to the amt of material squeezed onto the discs.  Definitely not HD, and should only be watched on small screens. <br />- the chopping up of artists' sets.  Why leave out the Dido songs?  What happened to REM's 'Imitation of life'.  Green Day?  C'mon how about the full set? <br />- The extra Edinburgh show is great, but couldn't that one have gone as a seperate set, like Rome and Paris?  I wish the full 4-discs could have been the Hyde Park show.
B000002VE7|5.0|This CD explores the concept of struggling through life, and provides several good juggling songs as well.  The two Stereotomys, Beaujolais, and In the Real World are all good juggling songs.  Light of the World and Limelight are very good ballads.  The only weak points of the album are the instrumentals.  Where's the Walrus and Urbania are both good, but could be much better.  Chinese Whispers I am not sure about, as the moment it sounds like it is about to start, it turns into Stereotomy Two. <br /> <br />This album is made even better by the fact that it marks the end of an Era for Parsons.  After this album, all of Parsons' work (excluding Gaudi, which I don't have) is full of interesting concepts that are just missed by the lyrics, or even, in some cases (Call Up on Time Machine), downright butchered by the lyrics. <br /> <br />Stereotomy is a great album, has lyrics that hit the concepts on the head, and is very much worth owning. <br /> <br />Oh yeah, a great juggling album as well.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|Being one of the most anticipated movies of the year, I decided to go see `King Kong' to see what all the hype was about. Even though this movie is more than three hours long, I found it to be one of the best movies to be released this year.  <br /> <br />The story takes place in 1933, where Ann Darrow (played by Naomi Watts), a theatre actress, loses her job and is trying her best to make ends meets. Meanwhile Carl Denham (played by Jack Black), a movie director, runs away with the film equipment from the company after they reject his script. Having no actress to play the lead role, he sees Ann and asks her to act in his movie. He also traps Jack Driscoll (played by Adrien Brody), the writer for his film, into coming along with them for the filming. Ann and Jack fall in love along the way. Carl has other plans for his movie, which includes filming in an undiscovered island, not knowing what lies in it. When they go there, they experience things that would change their lives forever. <br /> <br />Since I haven't watched any previous versions of King Kong (even though I knew vaguely about the story), I really cannot compare how good or bad it is from the others, but I can say that I loved watching this film! It has everything in it: love, action, adventure, drama etc. which is what one expects from such a movie. The first one hour of a movie is a little slow, because it only shows the character developments; but after they reach Skull Island, the movie becomes a wonderful rollercoaster ride with a lot of twists and turns, amazing special effects, action, drama, everything put into one. Even though this movie is really long, I didn't find it dragging, but I admit that some of the scenes could have been easily omitted.   <br /> <br />Naomi Watts once again shows us that she is a talented actress by playing her role as Ann Darrow. Some reviews mention that all she did was scream a lot in the movie, but I feel her performance was the best because it is really hard to actwith an imaginary character, especially one such as King Kong. Jack Black, Colin Hanks, Thomas Kretschmann, Andy Serkis, Kyle Chandler and the rest of the cast also acted wonderfully! Even though I like Adrien Brody's acting, I feel his character was a complete waste in this film, as he never really did anything that had a major impact in the storyline. I feel that is one of the few things that Peter Jackson could have revised. But other than that, I loved everything about King Kong. The special effects were fantastic in most scenes, but could have been made more realistic in some parts, such as the shipwreck before Skull Island. <br /> <br />On the whole, I found \\"King Kong\\" much better than Peter Jackson's previous works, including Lord of the Rings.
B00006V9A0|4.0|This latest (greatest) hit CD is considerably good considering the fact that \\"main man\\" had no decision in it. Yes, maybe a few more songs should've been added, but nothing contained in the CD Nirvana should be removed. About A Girl may not have been a big hit, but many who saw them on MTV: Unplugged would come to find that they opened their show with this song, and was his very first striaght-ahead love song. Putting this on the CD was not a bad choice. Smells Like Teen Spirit, Come As You Are, and Rape Me were obvious choices, and probably one of the only reasons some bought this CD, but the best songs in my opinion WERE the ones unplayed, but you have to put greatest hits on a greatest hits CD. I do not personally believe this was only made for Courtney Love to get some extra money, but who's to get mad if it was? This CD, regardless of it's intentions, is great, especially for new listeners and fans of Nirvana.
B000002J6F|4.0|I'm not a musician but I have a few musician friends and they all told me that I need to get this recording and add it to my collection. After one listen, I know why...it's just a really great CD. It's stuff that probably never got much airplay but that doesn't mean much because radio is mostly used to sell things. Radio has never been an outlet for the creatively inspired unless of course you are listening to radio stations that hold fund drives rather than relying on merchandisers.<br /><br />This CD needs to be listened to as a whole. Don't put it in your five disc changer and listen to it with other CDs because you will dilute its strength and diminish its magic. Just listen to it by itself and it will all come together for you.<br /><br />Like I said in the beginning of this review, I'm not a musician so I'm not going to go into the technical side of the music, but I have to tell you that after hearing this CD I can fully understand why my musician friends were pretty amped up about the ability to make music.<br /><br />I am giving it four stars not because I don't feel that it's a classic or a must have but because there are some other recordings that if push came to shove I'd choose over this one...maybe I need to listen to it some more and who knows, maybe I'll end up giving it a five.
B0000AQS0F|2.0|Smart writing indeed.  Purchased based on reviews here.  However, did not enjoy some of the values such as making prostitution look attractive and 'good'.  That alone ruined it for me in terms of being able to recommend it whole heartedly to others.  I gave a copy away for Christmas before viewing the episodes - but wished I had.
B000B8QF14|1.0|This DVD shows the scary heights of ego mania pretension, the angst driven success of punk rock millionaires that cry because they can't get their political ways and have to resort to wanting to be thought of as (snicker) 'dangerous.' Yes, Johnny Dangerous has come to your town to preach about evil G W Bush -- Bush is the Bible that contains the bullet -- and these tres cool exemplars of moral virtue (while dodging every imaginary bullet on our behalf) say F U and LOVE US with every breath.  They know that their cash cow tour can't really be dangerous, but if the money (that seriously scary toy for fast living rock star cry babies) should STOP (gasp)... that would be dangerous! So Greenday plays it safe... they put on a show, titillating each other with sex hand grabs in front of the camera... you know, it's all very dangerous, very Hollywood and has been done countless times before.  Therefore, there should be an audience warning sticker: because of moronic punk rock commercialism and mind numbing showbiz predictablitity the only danger is Zzzzzzzzzzzz!
B00005NB8J|5.0|Many science fiction films are fairly predictable in either premise or action. This one is not. It is very original and enjoyable. <br /> <br />An ancient Egyptian artifact seems to hold some tantalizing clues to an alien civilization. The pentagon has been trying to unravel these clues for decades but their progress is slow and halting until they enlist the aide of a maverick Egyptologist who quickly deciphers the needed clues. Suddenly, the artifact becomes the stargate, a portal to another planet. A team is sent to investigate and finds a colony of humans serving as slaves to mad Egyptian god. They must fight in order to free the slaves, protect themselves and protect the earth. <br /> <br />The effects and costumes in this one really add to the sense of wonder. They are at once modernistic and evocative of ancient Egypt. The \\"science\\" is a bit hokey but the story is a good one and it is well told. Kurt Russell comes off well as the veteran colonel who leads the expedition and James Spader does an excellent job as the inept scientist.  <br /> <br />There is no reason for this film to be top ranked in anything except that it is immensely enjoyable and it sticks in the memory. <br />
B000BGH22W|2.0|After seeing this movie and owning all the other soundtracks for Harry Potter I added this to my Christmas list. Upon opening presents I realized I could not recall the music from this film, which was not the case with the others. Now I know why. Without John Williams at the helm this music is empty and disapointing. It's just not Harry Potter-ish. I have nothing against this composer and am sure he is very talented. Just not for the Harry Potter movies. Mr Williams who is a musical genius did all the Star Wars movies so why not these? Not going to be playing this CD very often.
B0000524CY|5.0|I first saw this film when it came out in the 70s.  I must have been about 17 years old.  I went with a friend to the drive-in theater.  I had consumed a couple of sodas and had to pee really bad, but because of this film, I could not force myself to get out of the car and walk in the dark to the restroom.  That's how scary and disturbing the film is.  I have never been so scared before or since watching The Exorcist.  I had a chance to view it again, as an adult in my late 30s, and this time the shock was not so profound, but it was still quite provocative and disturbing.  Not for the faint of heart, but if you are into shock value and the ultimate cinematic horror thrill ride, watch this one alone in a very dark room.
B000002KAT|5.0|My cousins are all signifigantly older than me and as soon as they found out that I was \\"into\\" music they were trying to get me to listen to this album and yet for some reason I just never did. I felt that if I really wanted to listen to it, I would.<br /><br />Well, the days of vinyl gave way to digital and I was probably about 28-29 years old and I saw this recording just laying on the store's counter.  I remember holding the old album cover as a kid  at my cousin's house. It felt familar even though I had yet to listen to it so I ended up buying the CD. I thought that if I really hated it I could always return it.<br /><br />From the very first song to the very last song I was mesmerized. I really didn't think that this would have much of an effect on me, but it did. It felt as though it was welcoming me into a private little mystical world. After listening to it the first time I excitedly called my cousin to tell him of my great \\"discovery\\".<br /><br />When I told him, he just laughed, \\"I knew that you'd listen to it someday...\\"<br /><br />If you have yet to listen to this CD make that someday today. This recording puts the \\"class\\" into classic. It's deep, it's powerful, it's hauntingly familiar and it'll seep down into the very marrow of your bones.
B000002VC3|5.0|A little nugget of information.  Not only is Sirius the Chicago Bulls theme song, the Vanderbilt University (Nashville, TN) Commodores men's basketball team plays Sirius when announcing the Vanderbilt starting lineup.    The CD opens with Sirius, the first Alan Parsons song I ever heard, and my most played Alan Parsons song.  Sirius is a very good song, although I have overused it.    Eye In The Sky follows Sirius, and is Parsons' most famous song (and one of his best ten, too).  The following song, Children of the Moon, is a good song about the death of culture that I sadly don't play nearly enough.    Gemini is another strong song, as is Silence and I.  However, the musical interlude in Silence and I is distracting.    You're Gonna Get Your Fingers Burned is one of threee Alan Parsons songs that I ever heard before having discovered Alan Parsons (Sirius and Time being the other two).  Parts of the song (\\"all I do is only to suprise you, every move is slight of hand, and every word is meant to mystify you\\") forcibly reminds me of Breakfast of Champions, one of my favorite books, by Kurt Vonnegut, my favorite author.  Kurt Vonnegut has Kilgore Trout write a letter from God to the only sentient being in the universe.  The letter explains that everyone and everything else, God included, is a robot, and all that they do is meant to illicit a response from the being (known as the man).    Psychobabble may be a fan favorite, but that's all psychobabble rap to me.  It just doesn't get me like other songs by Parsons do.  Mammagamma gets the CD back on track, being one of four five star Alan Parsons instrumentals out of the 28 I own (Return To Tunguska, Lucifer, and The Ace Of Swords being the other three).    Step by Step is a step backward, but it is better than Psychobabble.  Finally, the CD ends with one of my all time favorite APP ballads, Old and Wise.  This song, like Sirius, was one of the first five Parsons I ever heard, and is still one of my top ten Parsons.    All in all, this is Parsons' fourth/fifth/sixth best album (behind I Robot, Turn of a Friendly Card, and Stereotomy, and in competition with Pyramid and Vulture Culture.  Full of great songs, this CD is well worth the money.  Of course, I got it for free, so who am I to say that?

B000301YY8|5.0|Awesome and truthful.  Heartfelt music that flows straight from his heart and life experiences.  Poetry put to music. Guareented to be a cherished addition to any music library.
B00005JO1J|5.0|Haveing never seen the play nor hearing any of the music, I was very inspired to see the movie from seeing the commercials for it. The first half of the movie I thought would have been better to see on stage, but let me tell you, the second half of the movie is a WHOLE other story. It grabs you by the neck and pounds you in the gut till you cant stop crying at the very end of the credits. I am totally obsessed by the movie and soundtrack and cant wait for it to come out on DVD.  <br />Like I said, during the first half I kept thinking of things I had to do the next day, but after I left the movie in total breakdown, LOL, I even cried all the way home. <br />Pretty amazing, I must say.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This is the best CD I've bought in a long time.  Nice Jazzy, big bandish, Sinatra, Connick Jr ish....Home is awesome!!!!  And the covers too.  Surprised at the Beatles cover.  I'd love to see him live!!
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I'm afraid I must disagree with those who are fans of the song \\"When Love is Gone\\" as I was delighted that I didn't have to skip it while viewing my new DVD for the first time. I cringed every time the first strains of that song were heard on my VHS version and am greatly relieved that it's been removed. I love this movie even more than ever without that awful song! It was far too sappy, much too long, and I doubt anyone viewing the movie for the first time will notice any kind of continuity glitch.<br /><br />This is my favourite version of A Christmas Carol and I'm so glad to have the special anniversary edition. The outtakes are quite funny, even though there aren't many of them. \\"Pepe Profiles Presents: Gonzo as a Young Wierdo\\" is amusing, but the \\"Christmas Around the World\\" section is lacking depth and I doubt it will hold the interest of most children. Overall, the extras are nice but short.
0060899190|3.0|I was very excited to find out a book was being made of one of my favorite websites.  Upon recieving the book, I was dissapointed to find postcards spread across two pages.  I also would have liked to seen more \\"un-website\\" secrets.  This book is wonderful for someone new to Post.Secret, but too familiar for me.
B00009UW0N|5.0|We all know the movie itself is one of the pioneering slasher flicks, so I will spare you the obvious.<br /><br />This Anniversary Edition DVD release makes a great addition to any collection.  The picture and sound are terrific.  On the feature disc, you also get optional commentary from John Carpenter, Jamie Lee Curtis and Debra Hill.<br /><br />The bonus disc includes an indepth documentary focusing on the original Halloween movie and those that would come to follow.  Particular attention is paid to describing the production process for the original, low-budget film that would go on to shocking success to become a lasting Halloween staple.<br /><br />The bonus disc also includes a featurette called \\"On Location - 25 years Later\\".  This featurette, by Debra Hill and actress P.J. Soles, describes the original locations used for shooting Halloween.  They revisit the Myers house and discuss the area as it was 25 years ago, as contrasted by its current state.<br /><br />Great film, great bonus features...  Highly recommended.
B0000524CY|5.0|Yes, very good movie and scary!! You must see it and don't be scream hahaahah!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Despite the fact that I didn't even realize this was on television until way after it was cancelled, I knew it was something I was eventually going to get around to watching. And I really wished that myself and many more made more of an impact on the ratings because this was, and IS still a great piece of television.  <br /> <br />I have really become a \\"fanboy\\" of Joss Whedon's work, kinda following the shows upward, though also joining them far too late to be able to grasp the storyline. But, I'm thankful for friends who happen to have like all of Angel and Buffy combined on DVD, and now have the Firefly series to let me get the whole picture.  <br /> <br />I had seen a few episodes randomly on SciFi, and now I have seen them all on DVD and already have the set on order. Serenity has also joined my rather small DVD collection of about 10 total DVD's, mostly a couple box sets of TV shows that I have loved and lost, lol.  <br /> <br />Anyway, if you like anything that Joss has done, you'll love this. You'll also notice many familiar faces from that of Buffy and Angel episodes which is kind of uplifting as most of them had minor parts in those series and really get to shine as the brightest stars in the verse in Firefly/Serenity.
B00000294R|5.0|BIG L WAS THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME!!! <br /> <br />I HAVE 135 OF HIS SONGS AND I LOVE ALL OF THEM
B000BVEKO0|2.0|I must say that I am really disappointed with this CD. I just bought and after listening to it for less than an hour, and had to stop. I do understand that bands need to evolve and that the days of their first album and of Peachy will not ever come back, but this is not what I expected at all. I expected some changes in the sound, thanks to Head leaving, but that was it. The whole dynamic of their song writing process have changed. I do not feel the connection I used to feel when they were my all time favorite band. New Korn fans will probably appreciate it, because it is not bad musically. It still has some hard riffs and the music is ok, but the lyrics are not there.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|This combination package is Exceptional and would appeal to everybody who appreciates quality of sound and visuals and loves being fully engaged and entertained. Buble is a stunning performer and captures you from his 1st appearance on stage and the perfect first note. Add the cd of songs and it's a winner all round
0553801503|5.0|This book was excellent!  I cannot wait for A Dance With Dragons.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|\\"Serenity\\" works on so many levels, and fails on so few, it's a shame the public didn't absolutely fall in love with Joss Whedon's wholly original yet comfortably derivative universe. <br /> <br />Comparisons to \\"Star Wars\\" are valid, in that George Lucas took several, infinitely familiar themes, scenarios and characters, and combined them into a creation clearly his own. <br />That's what you get here. <br /> <br />The argument whether or not you need to see the TV series before is moot: if you haven't yet seen it, you will desperately want to after seeing this movie. <br /> <br />The characters are simply a delight to watch interact with each other. Nathan Fillion, as the leader of the band, Mal Reynolds, is one of the great, recent heroes of filmdom. He's got the gravitas, the humor, the physicality...he's the real deal. The supporting cast is so good, you wish the movie was longer, but THAT'S why you'll go back to the DVD box of the TV show. You will love spending more time with these guys... <br /> <br />...yes, most of them (in this film) are carefully drawn with a few lines and scenes; they don't have the depth they displayed during the series...but they CAN'T in under two hours. Believe me...the actress playing Inora \\"the companion\\" (Morena Baccarin)is one of the most startlingly beautiful actresses I've ever seen. She's given a criminally small amount of screen time and should have been a bigger part of this film. Just because I wanted to see more of her. The brief scenes between her and Fillion just beg for more time... <br /> <br />Much has been made about some of the tragedy being less significant if you haven't seen the preceding TV series. I wouldn't make too much about that point. Again, comparing this to \\"Star Wars\\", the death of Obi-Wan has more resonance now than it did when only the first film existed, but it still worked in that first film.  <br /> <br />But I'm being selfish...Whedon's film serves the story, and serves it well. He also tidies upmany of the over-arching plot themes from the TV show, but not so much that he doesn't leave us begging for more. That's quite the high-wire, tightrope balancing act. <br /> <br />The sinister Alliance, the impossibly nightmarish Reavers and that relentless, sword-carrying automaton combine to form a genuinely terrifying set of \\"bad guys\\".  <br /> <br />The action scenes are marvelous. There are fights and stunts that, by necessity, you've seen before (the cinematic Rolodex inside your head will start clicking off recollections of \\"Aliens\\", \\"Raiders\\"...), and then they tweak them in ways you would have never imagined.  <br />The chase scenes in space are breathtaking. I loved the punctuating silences as opposed to the expected bombastic whooshes and crashes. <br />The terrestrial hovercraft chase is a model of how things like this should be done. <br />The \\"airplane crash\\" scene is a pleasant torture to sit through. <br /> <br />There are small things, like Fillion's makeup near the end of the film. that add enormously to the movie. He looks like he got the crap beat out of him. Not because there were huge welts and dramatic bruises and blood-spattered clothing. It was all artful makeup and one disturbing contact lens. And of course, some phenomenal acting... <br /> <br />There's one short scene, where one character says nothing but \\"yes\\" over and over again, and another character says \\"no\\" in response, as both are staring out a windshield. We as the audience do not have to see what's going on, to completely understand what exactly is happening out that window. It's a brilliant bit of writing and acting. <br /> <br />A few pointers for those new to the Firefly Universe.  <br />Yes, they occasionally lapse into untranslated Chinese. English and Chinese are the two dominant languages in the future, and believe me, what they say needs no translation.  <br />Yes, they use a combination of old-fashioned weapons (six-guns) and sci-fi \\"ray guns\\", but it all works.  <br />Yes, a lot of this looks like the old West, but the frontier of a \\"terraformed\\" system of planets may look exactly like that. <br /> <br />There's really not a weak moment in the film. This is the first film in a long time where I had an all-consuming desire to watch it again. Right away. <br /> <br />This is a most impressive creation by Joss Whedon, and it would truly be a shame if this were to be the last we ever see of the Serenity crew.
B00007LTIC|5.0|It's sometimes been said that commencing with Tales from Topographic Oceans (1973), Yes began to appeal more and more to its hardcore fans exclusively.  Tales itself (which I love) certainly is difficult for a newbie to get into.  But Going for the One is not, and it'd be a shame for people to be scared away from it for that reason. <br /> <br />In fact, Going for the One contains some of the most beautiful and stunning music you'll ever hear from rock musicians.  Jon Anderson's voice is in top form (what other form is there for Jon's voice?), and the music will blow you away. <br /> <br />Some advice: it will take a few listens.  This isn't Britney Spears.  But make the effort, and I promise you'll be glad you did.  Please believe me when I say I'm not a loser with no life, but I honestly believe the world is a better place because songs like \\"Turn of the Century\\" and \\"Awaken\\" exist.  How many rock CDs could lead anyone - even if I really were a loser with no life - say such a thing? <br /> <br />Yes music is known for its climactic moments - get a good live version of \\"Close to the Edge\\" or \\"And You and I\\" to see what I mean - but Awaken trumps them all.  You'll be left shaking your head, speechless, by the end.
B0002IQMKM|4.0|\\"Once In A Lifetime\\" for me was the song and music video that got me to look away and find that there was and is other music out there besides movie score and soundtracks. \\"Once In A Lifetime\\" got me right into the 80s new wave or whatever you want to call it (there was really quite a lot of different \\"rock\\" \\"pop\\" and all the rest coming out of that decade). Talking Heads are endearing to me and I love this album. I don't have to listen to all these \\"best of the 80s\\" compilations but instead I can just listen to Talking Heads and get much better feeling for that unique sound that just gets a grip on you. I like this album. I can't say anything bad about it.
B0009WFFS6|4.0|Here is a very short review of this DVD:<br /><br />When I picked up this reunion DVD, I was concerned that Cream had lost its touch after all of these years, that I would hear geriatric versions of my old favorites or that these guys wouldn't gel.  Boy, were my fears unfounded!  The Cream is back, proving that they can be as tasteful or as hot as they want to be at any time.  Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce, and Ginger Baker are among the greatest figures in rock music - today or yesterday.  Check out this DVD and you will see why.
B000B0WODA|4.0|Franz Ferdinand is just a fun band.  The lyrics are amusing and the music makes you want to move!  I like this CD better than the first one.  They are both great cds but, this one brings a smile to my face more often.
1932907009|5.0|As a former TV development executive, I can tell readers that this is really and truly the best book on screenwriting I've read; it gives great, real-world advice about story, structure, genres, marketability - all with a great, quirky sense of humor that makes this fabulous, informative book a joy to read. Snyder has insider tips, strategies, shortcuts and advice for screenwriters, both novice and experienced. \\"Save The Cat!\\" is a load of fun for any movie lover, but it really is a must-read/must-own for people who want to become working, successful screenwriters and it gives them the tools necessary to get there. Three cheers for Blake Snyder!!!!!!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Great movie, great characters, it's a mystery to me why the series and movie didn't do better. So many people I know haven't even heard of it. That says something for the marketing, I think. <br /> <br />One of the best movies of the year, without a doubt.
B000BNTM96|5.0|I'm still a relatively new QOTSA fan. I'd heard a few of QOTSA's more popular songs, such as \\"No One Knows\\" and \\"In My Head\\", and I really dug what I heard. So I decided I'd pick this up the other day when I was browsing CD's at a local music store. I get home and begin listening to \\"No One Knows\\", and low and behold, towards the middle of the song they break into \\"Who Knows\\" by Jimi Hendrix. That just immediately made me go ape sh**, since Hendrix is pretty much my idol. That is deifintely my favorite part of the album/DVD.  <br /> <br />That being said, the rest of this CD/DVD is almost as amazing. I'm very impressed with every member of QOTSA's musicianship. I have a feeling I'll be buying more QOTSA albums in the near future.
B0002EXH4A|4.0|I just recently purchased the first version of SFSGSW, which is why I'm just now reviewing.  I wanted to hear both versions.  Let me say, first of all, that I am surprised by how some people seem to say that just because somethings \\"original\\" version came first, it has to be the best.  I've seen alot of people say that about every Megadeth re-issue.  Are you serious? <br />After listening to the first SFSGSW, I can honestly say that the remix makes a world of difference to the ear.  The production is so bad on the first one, you can't possibly tell me that remastering is a bad thing.  The newer version is crisp, and well done.  I didn't give it five stars because Mustaine chose to leave 502 on the album.  Yuch! <br />Other than that, this is probably the best remastering job of the bunch, and if you own the original, this is a must have as well.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Overall this does a pretty solid job in covering all of the hits of the band.  The cd clocks in at 79:42 so there really isn't any room for additional songs but I do wish \\"Nightrain\\" (a Top 20 hit in the UK and a popular song on rock radio) from \\"Appetite For Destruction\\" had been included somehow.  There are probably other songs from \\"Appetite\\" that would have been worthy additons as well but I would rather see a remastered version of that cd released.  <br /> <br />I realize there are plenty of fans who are disappointed in this compilation, either because there were too many covers or not enough material from \\"Appetite\\", and I do somewhat agree but strictly speaking this compilation does its job in delivering all the hits.  Hopefully there will either be a more comprehensive 2 disk \\"Best Of\\" or a box set released in the future that will include songs fans felt are missing here. <br />
B00005JNX0|5.0|The story begins on Marty the zebra's 10th birthday, when he wishes he could go to the wild. When he actually attempts it, his friends Alex the lion, Gloria the hippo and Melman the giraffe try to stop him from doing it. They all get caught and shipped to a new zoo, but unfortunately, the boat tips over and the 4 animals land in the water, later on being washed up on the shore of Madagascar (which ties into the story). However, all is not well there. Alex will do anything for a decent steak, even if it means biting his best friend's butt. <br /> <br />Also included on this DVD is the penguins' short film \\"A Christmas caper\\". While looking for a present for Ted the polar bear, the Private penguin gets mistaken for a chew toy and the other penguins have to save him from one angry puppy. There is also a \\"Move it!\\" Music video and a bunch of games and activities as well. <br /> <br />And finally, this DVD keeps the 5 star rating because you can fast forward through the commercials on this DVD, unlike the commercials that haunted the Shrek 2 DVD. <br /> <br />Overall, 5 stars. Move it to your video store and get this DVD today. It's a roaring good family film!
B00005JO1Y|5.0|this film tops all previous king kong attemps since the original.  it's amazing.  jack black, naomi watts, and adrien brody are all wonderful in the film, and i wouldn't be surprised if naomi watts were to be nominated for an academy award this year.  this movie has action, romance, and tragedy and is truly one of the best films of the year!
0143036556|3.0|Diamond tends to wander, at times aimlessly, around the globe searching for examples of societies that had succeeded or failed based on sustainable patterns of living. There was much in the way of anecdotal observations, often very interesting, about Greenland, Papua New Guinea and Easter Island that whetted my appetite for more information, but Diamond tended to skip lightly over his subject matter, leaving it up to the reader to search out more information. As a result, the book is really fodder for discussion moreso than a set of case studies on sustainable living.<br /><br />He tries to give the book immediacy by relating his research to his present day experiences in Montana, illustrating that we are making many of the same mistakes that led to the downfall of great civilizations of the past. The big battle, as he correctly notes, is over water. Without it, any civilization is at a loss to sustain its development, but once again he treads lightly over the subject, which is the most important issue facing us right now. Water rights remain a major sticking point in most international disputes.<br /><br />It is not to say that Diamond doesn't have an eye for detail, he presents compelling views of the internicine fights that led to the collapse of the formerly great civilization on Easter Island, and examines how Greenland failed and Iceland succeeded despite having similarly inhospitable climates. However, given Diamond's reputation I found myself longing for a deeper examination of the subject material, maybe even focusing specifically on a handful of case studies, which best exemplified his thesis that societies succeeded or failed based on their ability to maintain a sustainable pattern of living.
076790592X|1.0|This is one of the worst books I have ever read.  It drags on and on with no real point.  I highly recommend NOT wasting your time with this one.
B00005JO1Y|4.0|Peter Jackson brings to \\"King Kong\\" every lesson he ever learned in the Rings trilogy. His sets are dark and jagged. His monsters are terrifying and well-rendered. His cast (with the exception of Jack Black, more on this later) is made up of superb actors capable of portraying a range of emotions.<br /><br />Set in Depression-era 1930s New York City, KK is an action-packed movie about a failed nature filmmaker (Black) who desperately needs a hit to salvage his career. Through a series of happy accidents, he runs into Ann Darrow (a luminous Naomi Watts), a virtuous and unemployed actress. Together with a film crew and writer Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), they set off to uncharted Skull Island to film the weird animals said to live there. The film follows the familiar storylines - girl gets sacrificed to ape, ape falls in love with girl, men catch and display ape, ape goes ape and must be destroyed. But along the way, Jackson treats us to incredible visuals: a troop of spooked brontosauruses caroming off the walls of a narrow valley; a fight involving three (!!!) T-rexes; a search party attacked by some really big and nasty bugs; lots of falling into ravines.<br /><br />The climactic scenes are set in NYC and are stunning. Jackson ably communicates the frightful height of the buildings. His recreation of 1930s-era New York street scenes, some involving seemingly hundreds of cars and pedestrians, is incredible.<br /><br />For the most part, the acting was superb. Naomi Watts was wonderful as the girl who tried to communicate with an animal that others saw only as a brute. And Kong himself, in all his CGI glory, was awesome. Jackson gave him loneliness, intelligence and a personality capable of a rough kind of love and friendship. He even suggested a reason for Kong's ferocity with visual cues involving others of his kind. Jack Black, on the other hand, was a liability, completely incapable of conveying any but the grossest of emotions. But my kids disagree with me completely, so there.<br /><br />Is there a moral to King Kong? Is it the line, \\"It was beauty that killed the beast\\" that ended the original and is reprised here? Because truly, it was human greed, lack of respect for the natural world, and men made desperate by other men that killed the beast. Men, then and now, domesticate what they can and kill the rest, behaving more destructively than the beasts they fear. If there is a moral--in this time of global warming, species extinction and genocide--maybe that's it.<br /><br />Or maybe this is just a movie about a big monkey. But I'm not entirely convinced about that.<br /><br />KK is a spectacular movie, definitely worth the price to see it on the big screen. Be warned that the fight scenes are very violent, fully earning the film its PG-13 rating.there a moral to King Kong?

B000BW7QWW|5.0|That is the best line I can think of to describe this film.  The crew of Serenity is back and up to their old tricks, unstoppable as ever.*    Only one note for those who have not seen Firefly:  I suggest watching the series from beginning to end.  This is not because I feel the film will be confusing for you (the film sets up the 'Verse better than the series opener), but because once you've seen Serenity, you'll likely want to watch the series.  Being a later step in Whedon's timeline, Serenity will take some of the suspense out of Firefly, especially the first episode.    *Irony.  Part of these characters' charm is their lack of heroic capability.  They do a lot with very little.  Yes, they do some incredible things, but they're still very small fish in an infinite pond.  The point is that even the most insignificant individuals can make substantial ripples.  They do the impossible, and that makes them mighty.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|upon hearing madonna's latest cd, it immediately transported me back to Menjo's, the gay club/disco that the underage madonna used to dance at (myself included) back in the 70's . all that is missing is some 12 minute versions of each song .....easily her best in a long long long time ..... if your from that era of time , buy this cd now , if not , buy it to hear what dance music was like back then and the celebration of (gay) life experienced by those of us who experienced it first hand ...
B00000AFHM|3.0|Good songs, nice lyrics, soft sound...BeS won't certainly change our world but they do know how to write nice melodies you would sing under the shower or to your little son. Nothing seems to go farther than \\"nice\\", everything's entertaining, but some could underline the lack of a climax, i.e. a really impressive song, even tough some could say the title track could fit.  <br />In any case i find this album quite entertaining and well played. <br /> <br />Unfortunately this comes up with awful production and the worst recording ever seen on earth after 2nd World War. High frequences seem soooo high (2nd song, around 2,40) while parts of some songs are impossible to be heard without raising the voulme (1st song, 2,22).  <br /> <br />In conclusion a good job, but I can't agree giving 5 stars to this album. It's enjoyable but some songs look like filler (some well played indeed, but still fillers, some useless, as A space boy dream) and recording would get zero stars at all!
B0007OCG4W|5.0|I love the stage, and watching this movie it is easy to see that it was once a play.     There is a lot of character developement and the movie is almost constant dialogue between the 4 characters. The casting is superb; I was absolutely hypnotized by Natalie Portman's beauty throughout.    If you're looking for an action packed movie, this is not it. If you have an interest in the webs we tangle ourselves into and the almost genuine conversations that may go with it you will love this movie. I have watched it 3 times and am not yet tired of it.
B000BYRCH4|5.0|walker and alba did a great job here. the camera crew, the directors, the editors all did a great job. lotsa fun, great dive; only the music a bit annoying. this is so far the best diving movie i've really enjoyed greatly. don't try to give a few stars only to show that you're deep, this is a great entertainment, a fun movie, that's all. just couldn't believe that walker and alba could swim so  well and so elegantly wonderful. great young actors. cann is bit too short but not a bad actor either.
B000AP04FG|1.0|This movie is a waste of time. Forget it!
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|I wasn't quite sure where Nightwish would go with this release. Well, my question was answered when I listened to this album and heard 'I wish I had an Angel'.. Wow.. Nightwish has not slowed one bit. It's a pity that Tarja is leaving *or left* the band. This album has some key differences from their previous releases. The guitar work is a little different, but refreshing. All the elements were at work in this album. Do not hesitate, if you like Nightwish, get this.. despite what others might say about the bad direction they went in, because it is simply untrue, this is a kick ass release, highly recommended.
B0002TKFRM|5.0|Just how hard can it be, in this age of digi-techno miracle machinery, to make a recording of a major symphony orchestra that sounds natural?  They could do it at RCA Living Stereo (and Mercury Living Presence) in the 1950's with only two or three microphones and analog tube equipment.  Today, with all the gizmos, most orchestral recordings are over-processed, over-equalized, over-mixed and blended, pasturized and homogenized into grating sterility.<br /><br />This recording is wonderful.  The performance is magic.  The SACD layer is even more natural sounding than the CD layer.  Keep your 5.1 multi-channel surround sound, I'm hooked on Living Stereo.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|I was never a rabid fan of the TV series, but there is no denying it was much more entertaining and clever and than most of what happens on television, with the exception (perhaps) of a few HBO series and especially the other two series by Joss Whedon himself: Buffy and Angel.  It was a shame it didn't last long enough to let the stories and characters ease into the kind of maturity that allowed some of the later episodes of Angel and Buffy to reach a seamless combination of familiarity and innovation.  As far as I'm concerned, they finally reached that level in this film, which ties in nicely with the series by providing backstory that is only sketched in the episodes without significantly overlapping the material of the episodes.  In that way, the film works even if you were never a fan of the series -- though you do probably have to be the type of person that gets a kick out of (at least one of ...)westerns, space movies or kung fu flicks, you don't have to be a Trekkie or Star Wars geek (not that there's anything wrong with either of those!).<br /><br />The pre-credit sequence is probably the most innovative in terms of storytelling -- the film packs several layers of information about the universe we are in and the nature of two central characters into just a few minutes, and it is both enjoyable and intriguing.  After that, while the story itself is clever, it begins to feel a bit more like a conventional episode from the TV series (which is still more inventive and fun than most movies and tv), until the last twenty minutes or so when the story explodes into something much bigger than a TV episode and becomes, well, very obviously a very good movie.  Here's hoping there's more where this came from because Joss Whedon keeps getting better.

B000002TQV|5.0|This album marks the period in which Radiohead went from a mediocre pop band (as seen in 1993's Pablo Honey) to an outstanding rock band. The transformation and growth between their debut and The Bends is just amazing, especially considering the short time period of only 2 years. This is very complex and diverse rock music, although still less experimental than their later work. <br /> <br />Every song on this album is excellent but my favorites would have to be Planet Telex, The Bends, and My Iron Lung. <br /> <br />Although this is not my favorite Radiohead album, (that honor would go to Kid A) if you are new to this band i highly recommend you begin with this album and then move in chronological order (->  1997's OK Computer -> 2000's Kid A -> 2001's Amnesiac -> 2003's Hail to the Theif -> ? 2006) <br /> <br />You won't regret this one.

B000002P5W|5.0|Every song's a winner on this album with the possible exception of \\"EXP\\" which is just a bunch of feedback with a silly introduction to let us know what the noise is all about...but the thing I like about this album is that all the tracks, save \\"If 6 was 9\\" (which is a great song!), are fairly short and have a lot of continuity. \\"She's so Fine\\" (think \\"Little Miss Strange\\") isn't all that, but it is still a decent song which features Noel Redding's abilities. But song for song, this is a very strong album and excluding some of Hendrix's most memorable cuts on his other albums, this one contains more quality on one album than the others.( with the possible exception of his first). I bought this vinyl when it was first released and remember marveling at Hendrix and, at that time, even loved \\"EXP\\". But after 38 years (and many years of sobriety!) this album still plays very well, even \\"EXP\\" conjures some memories. This album is definitely a favorite of mine and gets a lot of playing time. If, like me, you are re-collecting your favorites from the 60's and  70's this is a must. Lots of good stuff and some long forgotten songs that I had to just slap my forehead and wonder how I could have forgotten such classics. Truthfully, I've put off \\"rebuying\\" this album choosing to buy other Hendrix stuff ahead of it...but now that I have it, I'm not sure why I waited; maybe my early brain cell losses contained the memories from this album! But seriously, I agree with another person who reviewed this album: it should be the first or 2nd Hendrix album you buy--in the first three minimum.

B000BW7QWW|4.0|I love the world of Firefly/Serenity and saw the movie on opening night with great joy. I really enjoyed the movie and liked the resolution of the questions the series left hanging. My main disappointment with the film was that it doesn't use the beautiful Firefly series theme song at all. I bought the DVD as soon as I saw it was out. I gotta say, it's a disappointing DVD package. The front cover is so shiny (and not in the Firefly vernacular way) and features an unflattering picture of River way, way too big (the movie, need I repeat, is about Mal). There is NO paper collateral in the DVD--nothing but an ad for Battlestar Galactica. Nothing! I was amazed. There are copious special features on the DVD, but the packaging makes this genuine release look like a bootleg. When I opened it I honestly thought I'd been ripped off somehow.
B000002UY5|4.0|I really enjoyed this album by Blind Melon. The style this band upholds start to finish on this disc shows there unique, generic writing style that has been attempted by other bands for twenty years. I thought that the album was well written, and obtained a few genious songs that will never be forgotten by myself. The thing I did not like about this album was how half the songs drag a lot, and how the songs dont fit right in the order they're in. BM got sloppy on about four songs trying, and its interesting to hear them jam a bit, but in my opinion it ruined a few of the tracks. Overall, I was modestly impressed by this album and I think it is creatively written.
B000063DHK|5.0|Indeed, Live After Death is Iron Maiden at their best. The 2 disc set contains the highlights of the World Slavery Tour, with disc one being recorded over a four night period at Long Beach Arena, and the second being recorded at the Hammersmith Odeon. Although the mix might not be as clean as the other live albums, the energy of the band makes up for it. Bruce hits the high notes, such as the bone chilling scream at the end of Aces High, just as good, if not better than on any other live albums. Also included are some oddities, that haven't been in the setlist for years. These include the epic Rime Of The Ancient Mariner, Children Of The Damned, Powerslave, Aces High, and Die With Your Boots On. The only real complaint is that several songs were not put on the album, but on the singles. These include the usual closer, Sanctuary, and the instrumental Losfer Word, which was only played at several shows on the European leg, and not since. <br /> <br />Overall, this album will not disappoint!
0553801503|5.0|I read reviews of this book in which people speak of boredom. They complain the book is too long, there are too many minor characters, and that not enough happens. If you are an intelligent, thoughtful, follower of Westeros you will understand the reasons why this book has a slower pace.  <br /> <br />George R.R. Martin has always given us a dark, gritty world. Since a Game of Thrones main characters have died, things we thought permenant would dissapate, and nothing ever felt safe. There was no promise of a happy ending. This was not a fairy tale world- it was a land of power struggles, murder, incest and adultrey. Martin was giving us something most fantasy fails to elicit; enough reality to make the world believable. <br /> <br />That said, this book was meant to be the down-time. Can every single book increase the action? Every book in the series has become increasingly fast-paced, with battles and distant locales, deaths and political upheaval. We have seen everything we know change, and then the new paths end or fork into yet again something different! Martin obviously intended for much to happen- NO CHAPTER HERE COULD HAVE BEEN CUT! There is a reason why it feels so slow....it's the calm before the storm. Does anyone honestly believe that George R.R. Martin is incapable of creating action or suspense? No. This book was meant to draw you in. Lull you into a sense of security. Nothing is happening....this book is about tension. About the wait. You can feel the struggles boiling the water, and you can see pawns being set in place, but nothing is resolved. <br /> <br />Why? Well, partly because this book was split in two. The next book will probably be just as \\"slow\\". What does that mean? It means that Martin is writing just as well as ever, but is trying to introduce sub-plots, smaller characters, and alternate perspectives before the beginning of the end- and that is what is coming. How can anyone say the situation with the Greyjoys could have been cut? How isBrienne's struggle to find Sansa, or the things Sansa going through with Petyr unimportant? Wake up! There is a reason for every situation in this book.  <br /> <br />A Feast for Crows, as I predict a Dance with Dragons will be, is drawing you further in. Martin has set the hook and it letting us draw the line a bit so that when he really tugs us in, we'll be shocked. Many main characters are absent, yes. This was not intended. The book length required it be cut. If you read this series just for the action and your favorite characters, stop reading here. If, like me, you are honored to be a part of the world Martin has created and enjoy his writing style- this is another amazing book. There is nothing but enjoyment. Conclusions? No. All our favorite characters? No. The world we have come to love, with the writer who paints the picture vividly? Absolutely!!

B000C1YL1G|5.0|<br />Through his years, Eminem has provided us with the best rap heard for a long time. Curtain Call is the end of it all - he's back with his wife Kim (which is ironic because he disses her in songs) and has a family again. Curtain Call truly is all his hits. The only songs missing should have been \\"Hailie's Song\\" and \\"Mosh\\". <br /> <br />Three new tracks have been written for this CD, \\"Shake That\\" feat. Nate Dogg, \\"Fack\\" and \\"When I'm Gone\\". \\"When I'm Gone\\" is an AMAZINGLY POWERFUL song. You feel what Eminem feels, and you understand how hard his like still is with all the fame. Also, Eminem's duet with Sir Elton John performing \\"Stan\\" live is featured. <br /> <br />The 2nd CD is filled with more \\"Underground\\" songs. Including an old duet with Jay-Z (\\"Renegade\\") and one with Notorious B.I.G. (Dead Wrong) and some other previously unreleased songs. This CD is worth buying the deluxe edition for. <br /> <br />So, all in all, Eminem surely has made an amazing compilation for us, the fans. Curtain Call, is truly the end of it all ...

B000002U82|1.0|I dont understand why people like this band.  The singing isnt good, the lyrics suck, and they play for so long without even singing.  I personally would like some WORDS in a song.  These people need to stay where they belong, in the past!  If you want to listen to some good music listen to Green Day, or Fall Out Boy, or My Chemical Romance, or even Panic! At the Disco.  This crap doesnt deserve to be listened too.  The only good music is punk and emo.  omg lol this cd is a piece of sh**.  Old people should just go listen to the beatles or something. geesh.  -*jacdale8
B000B8QEZG|5.0|You have to listen to this album several times, preferrably WITH HEADPHONES. Only way to get full effect. <br /> <br />1. Let It Will Be <br />2. Like It Or Not <br />3.

Jump <br />        ---song listed 2nd on the sticker on the cover.  That's giving it too much credit.  Oh, it's good, though.  Be better, if it'd been produced by Mirwais. <br /> <br />10.

But maybe too elegant for the middle of the album?  I don't know... <br /> <br />12. Push <br />        ---Annoying.  Should've been a minute interlude.  Or just a ballad on a different album. <br /> <br />13. Super Pop <br />        ---Should've been on the album instead of \\"Push.\\"  But, at the end of the album. <br /> <br />14. Fighting Spirit <br />        ---It's so wonderful they left this song off.  It's produced by Mirwais, and not a very good song.  Defintite B-side...along with \\"Push.\\" <br /> <br />     ...but still one the best albums in a LONG time.
B000777J2S|5.0|Of all the albums I have heard this year none compare in sheer emotional velocity to I am a bird now; I can't say enough about how beautiful and poignant this album is. I cried alongside my cousin (both of us 20 year old college guys...) during fistful of love, a song that reaches a crescendo mixing antony's sultry voice with horns and piano that is absolutely gorgeous.  <br />  The album as a whole swells and cascades with subtle (lyrically not so subtle) transitions in style. Certain songs, such as my lady story, are hypnotic and entrancing, while others seem to be combusting with Antony's overwhelming emotional burden (hope theres someone).  <br />  I can compare this in style to other albums, but its really not neccassary, any fan deep jazz infused lyrically driven music will enjoy this album. <br />   As I said not for everyone if you are easily turned off by slightly questionable voices (say, you can't listen to Johnny Cash or Dylan simply because of thier voices (God forbid...)) you will probably not enjoy this.  <br />  This is the only album to come out this year that I would give 5 stars to and undoubtledly an album I will treasure for many years to come.
B0000ACY0Y|5.0|I don't know whether I agree with fans who feel that this album was Gene Clark's masterpiece. However, this CD version with the added tracks is definitely the definitive version of \\"No Other.\\" Indeed, I prefer the songs in their earlier, more simple format, with Gene's spirited singing, softer guitars, and the absence of the choir. It should be noted that this album far exceeds anything being done at the time, or since, by McGuinn, Crosby, and Hillman. A must buy!
0060005696|5.0|This book makes a compelling case that a primary driver of unhappiness in current American (and Japanese) society is the wealth of choices and the drive by consumers to absolutely maximize benefit. I was particularly impressed by the amount of research done and the careful work to separate correlation from causation in his analysis - this isn't the sloppy thinking of an editorial pushing a random thought, but is the well-considered theory of a practiced researcher and educator.<br /><br />He also goes one further and offers practical advice to increase your happiness and ability to effectively make decisions. I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who feels any stress at all over job change, shopping, or even love life choices.<br /><br />The only thing I would've liked to see is a little bit less of a focus on happiness and market behavior. For example, when he covers choices around health insurance, he focuses heavily on how abundance of choice has done a good job of bringing down the cost of health care, but that it's brought a lot of stress to people when finding it. However, he doesn't talk about how the abundance of choice has impacted the quality of health care that people are receiving. Throughout the book, the primary impact of choices (quality of health, life, clothing, etc.) are mostly ignored in favor of either market efficiency or happiness issues.
B000B63IEI|5.0|When it comes to contemporary interpretations of these beloved Rachmaninov piano concerti there are options and choices: some will favor the opulently virtuosic jumping off the piano bench, heart on the sleeve, guaranteed standing ovation manner where pianist vies for attention with composer; some will prefer the musical elegance to the show biz glitz and find new threads of continuity forming from the musicality of less self-serving musicians. Leif Ove Andsnes clearly belongs more in the latter category.<br /><br />That is not to say that the heart of the works is flat: quite the opposite.  Andsnes plays with such virtuosity that his attention to line and detail allows each of the 'big moments' to develop intelligently, sensitively, and the result is  even stronger payoffs.  His tone is never forced or rushed and even in the most technically challenging measures of each work his ability to make every note available to the listener's ear is a feat accomplished by few others.<br /><br />Anthony Pappano and the Berlin Philharmonic provide lush, powerful reinforcement of Andsnes' choices.  The orchestra blooms when starred (some very fine first desk solos here!) and supports when the piano sings the melodies.  Some would say this is a thinking person's Rachmaninov, but Andsnes appeals both to the mind and the heart in this warmly detailed reading of two old warhorses of concerti.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, December 05
B000BEZQ18|4.0|Simply wonderful.  The soundtrack stands on its own against a beautiful movie.  Emmylous Harris and Willie Nelson really stick out and should definately be listened to.  What beautiful voices these singers have!  I swear, no voice could capture the films spirit better than Willie and Emmylou.
B000BYRCH4|4.0|INTO THE BLUE surprises.  Despite an opening sequence that is frightening and grisly, this film starts with the feeling that it is another pretty people at the beach flick - mindless, but visually attractive 'what I did last summer on the waves'  story. But stay tuned: this is a film of visual splendor and tense intrigue and action that is up there with the best of them.<br /><br />Amidst some of the most spectacular underwater sea photography on record blooms a story of friends with polar priorities: Jared (Paul Walker) and Sam (Jessica Alba) live the simple life in the Bahamas, sport diving, looking for lost treasure ships as a hobby; visiting lawyer friend Bryce (Scott Caan) and his just-met current squeeze Amanda (Ashley Scott) have dubious pasts and are out for the quick buck no matter the dangers.  This quartet spends the first part of the film diving and playing underwater with the glorious sea life until the unexpected discovery of a submerged airplane (recall the opening sequence) containing vast amounts of cocaine changes the playing board.  Jared and Sam won't deal in drug trafficking while Bryce and Amanda are unable to resist.  Once this strident mark is hit the movie becomes a fast paced intrigue of good vs evil, crime, police corruption, all mixed with chase sequences both on land and underwater.  Tragedies occur, priorities alter and the polarities among friends are tested.<br /><br />Even if the story of sunken treasure and drug trafficking weren't as well written as they are, this film would be well worth the time spent just watching some of the finest underwater choreography on a stage both fascinating and gorgeous and with a cast of beautiful bodies in synch with the splendor.  The cast is good and certainly beyond even the eye-candy appeal of each of the actors.  Peter Zuccarini's underwater cinematography deserves Oscar attention; Shane Hurlbut controls the above water cinematography well.  But director John Stockwell is to be commended for the pacing of this edge-of-the-seat story - and that is saying a lot for a film that is close to two hours long!  Yes there are chinks in the mortar of the story and moments where the audience must suspend belief (just how long can Paul Walker hold his breath anyway?), but in the end this is a film that deserves serious attention from the movie audience.  It is better than you would expect!  Grady Harp, December 05the pacing of this edge-of-the-seat story - and that is saying a lot for a film that is close to two hours long!  Yes there are chinks in the mortar of the story and moments where the audience must suspend belief (just how long can Paul Walker hold his breath anyway?), but in the end this is a film that deserves serious attention from the movie audience.  It is better than you would expect!  Grady Harp, December 05
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie is so bad, that it's so good.  Except, it's meant to be bad, which makes you feel good, about laughing at it to the point of almost wetting yourself. <br /> <br />This movie is not for everyone.  It is dry-humour, but if like movies like Office Space, or Drowning Mona, you will LOVE Napoleon.
B000B8QEZG|2.0|As an avid Madonna fan for years, I found this much-anticipated CD a big disappointment.  It confirms my fears that Madonna has lost her edge and now is appearing more like a has-been than ever before.  Madonna's musical peak, in my opinion, was Ray of Light.  The 90's, with Bedtime Stories, Ray of Light and even Music in 2000 were all forward-thinking and innovative works.  This CD, Confessions on a Dance Floor, coupled with the previous disaster, American Life, are a trend, not anomolies, for Madonna. <br /> <br />The lyrics in some of Madonna's latest songs are juvenile and lack artistic talent (ie, \\"You can f=== off, go to Texas, isn't that where they golf\\")  The rhymes in these lyrics are amateur and sound even worse in the song. The music just isn't the same from Madonna. She is trying to hard to hang on to a career that is transitioning on without her. <br /> <br />Compared to other musical contemporaries, such as Gwen Stefani, Madonna's music is passe, and, at best, second-rate.  Madonna, as much as I hate to see it, is a musical artist whose time has come and gone.  I always believed that she would transition on to other things and not try to hang on to her music, though, with the relase of this CD (why didn't someone stop her?), it appears she has not realized this.  She is a well-rounded artist who can produce, support new talent, etc. rather than hanging on in desparation to a career whose best years have come and gone. <br /> <br />
B00005JOFO|5.0|This movie is simply beautiful.  The young actors give performances that rival the best.  The scenery is, of course, georgeous, and the story by Annie Proulx is top-notch. <br /> <br />This is not a movie for people who like simple movies wrapped up in a nice tight ending.  It is for people who have loved, and lost, regardless of their sex, color, race or age.   <br /> <br />I will see this movie in the theater a few more times - because I am taking various friends to see it as well.   <br /> <br />One has to approach the film with as much maturity as those who created it, and that is not easy, but well worth it if you do.  If you do, you will see yourself in the characters, I guarantee. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
6305388458|5.0|This movie is a complete scream!!!! It is worth the price of admission for the Biggus Dickus scene alone. \\"I have a fwend in wome named Biggus Dickus\\" \\"Do you find it funny when I say the name Biggus........Dickusss. Michael Palin as the emperor with the speach impediment has all the cast in stitches during this skit. Too bad \\"The Meaning Of Life\\" was such a letdown.
B000B5IPLK|2.0|I'm pissed off that I got this CD and can't load it to my iPod!!!  The CD won't even play on RealPlayer, Windows Media Player or anything else, except the software that the CD has on it that you must install onto your computer.  You can only play this CD with the CD's software!!!  BAD!  I paid for it, I want to do what I want with it!
B000BO0LLS|4.0|With that said let us begin my review of the Emancipation of Mimi Platinum Edition album, as i already reviewed the original album earlier this year. It is without a shadow of a doubt that the original Emancipation of Mimi album was the strongest and best R&B album of the year of 2005 there was no equal. However my displeasure with this album is mainly directed at the record company, as this was a blatant move for greedy corporate moguls to exploit Mariah's fans by not including these tracks on Mariah first release of the emancipation of mimi. Alas this is problem that will only continye to fester as Mariah is not the only artist to have reissued a sucessful album take Usher's confessions and R.kelly who is notoriously known for remaking his original albums, hence \\"Trapped in the Closet Chapters 1-20.\\" Nevertheless, let us go back to the album at hand which is the The Emancipation of Mimi - Ultra Platinum Edition [CD/DVD Combo]which added four new songs including a DVD of her songs.     1)Don't Forget about us- This was a great song. Lyrics were amazing, mariah's voice once again incredible and beautiful as she sings to her lover to remember their love at thie best. 10/10    12)Makin it last all night- Great club song. This song is more for moving around and dancing lyrics were great and she even uses some lyrics from R&b legends Jodeci from the song \\"Feenin\\" All in all a decent song. 8.8/10    13) One and Only Part II- Incredible song and the most anticipated song on the album. All three elements of a great song were processed: Great beats and music, incredible sung and rapped lyrics by Mariah and Twista. it was so great that my brother who is not an avid Mariah fan even liked the song; had to give it 10/10    14) We belong together remix feat Jadakiss-Great remix song. Mariah once again blows on this song (black term meaning that she really sang her heart out) Jadakiss was once again infalliable 10/10    My only displeasure with the Emancipation of Mimi is that itdid not include her other remix singles for instance 1)It's like that w/ Fat Joe (Great song for the clubs) 2) Shake it off remix version with Jay Z- that is off the chain!!!! And lastly Secret Love which is okay. Another deceitment made by the recording company where I see another album in the midst containing the above songes aforementioned.   Now last let me respond to some of the vicious comments made about this album and the artist. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion however I feel that if your going to review an album please listen to the album first and then decide whether it is good or not. I am remarking to some of the distasteful rubbish other site members are making regarding this album that are just plain immature. If you dislike the album that's cool, but when you begin to discredit an artist because you hate what that artist is that really is sad. I am an avid Mariah Carey fan yet I can recognize when an album she has produced is not in her caliber, hence Charmbracelet and Glitter. However when a product is good I have to give it props and this album singlehandledly brought R&B back!!!! I am an avid R&B fan I listen to all types of R&B from Deniece Williams, Cheryl Lynn, the Emotions, Luther Vandross, Teddy Pendergrasss, Marvin Gaye to En Vogue, Mariah, Whitney and even Ashanti, Usher, Beyonce whom in my opionion do not even measure up to great R&B singers of the past who wrote incredible lyrics that would make your heart break or sing and produced their own music that made your groove and dance!!!   But in order to understand R&B music you must first understand the generation era Mariah Carey comes from which was why I can respect her. She came up when the ultimate queen of all voices was at her prime Ms. Whitney Houston where in the entertainment business your voice had to sell not your body. Ms. Carey highly deserves much critical acclaim and props because she as an artist that had to prove not only to herself but to many different and millions of fans that she could sing just as good as Ms. Houston and she did. Mariah voice is undisputable as she can sing on and off stage however with the current trend of R&B. So Stop HATING!
B0007MWZEK|1.0|I purchased the swivel sweeper in August of 2005.  After owning it four months, it no longer works. <br /> <br />The pole broke after 2 days of usage, and the company did replace the pole; however, it took five weeks and three emails to customer service before I had a replacement pole.  The sweeper was not used for approximately one month.  Now, after three months of using the swivel sweeper, the battery will NOT hold a charge.  To replace the battery, the Ontel company charges $15 plus $6 handling/shipping, for a total of $21.  Called the corporate offices and they said that the battery is only supposed to last 3-6 months (actually, mine lasted 3 months).  Hence, to run this stupid contraption, you must be willing to spend an extra $84 a year (4 x $21) just to keep the battery going, and that doesnt even include other parts that need replacement.  Seems to me the company intentionally made a poor quality rechargeable battery so that you'd have to keep replacing it!  That is not an ethical business practice to a consumer who is on to scams like this!  Also, they say that it runs up to 45 minutes on a single charge, but after 1 month, the battery starts to fail, and after three months, the battery holds a charge for about 30 seconds and then dies! <br /> <br />I'm not replacing my battery and giving into this corporate scam! And, I'm letting everyone I know that they'd be better off finding another cordless sweeper that holds a charge! <br />
B000089CKH|5.0|This album is a true gem. I've given 5 stars to other albums on this site before, but this one is one of those CDs that truly deserves it. EVERY song on this album is catchy and interesting which is the best one could ask for. Singer Matthew Caws I think is PERFECT for the band - he's got enough range, charisma and pizazze which makes each song much better than it sometimes should be. He's definitely one of the best unknown singers around today. The majority of lyrics here are very very good (and sometimes pretty quotable). They're definitely memorable and catchy enough that it makes singing a lot relatively easy (and fun!). The musicianship is also excellent - every song is relatively complex and they all feature great hooks. I'm going to make the claim that if you don't like this album (or at least appreciate it) then you can't say you love music (or at least pop rock).  Overall, do yourself a favor and buy this album - you won't regret it. I can't recommend this enough!<br /><br />Highlights include:<br /><br />the whole album!
0060922583|3.0|I have to admit, once I started reading this book I couldn't put it down. But one soon gets the sense the author is so desperate/enthusiastic to believe in these phenomena that his views are obviously biased, and he fails to balance his 'beliefs' with scientific fact (or is it that he avoids delving in too deep in the fear his theories will be disproved and his precious beliefs shattered?) For instance he fails to acknowledge or account for those who have experienced horrifying NDE's (and there are many!!).  <br /> <br />Despite the fact he fails to provide convincing scientific evidence, I still found it quite fascinating and thought provoking.
B00000294R|5.0|Big L is probably most well-known for being the standout member of the Diggin' In The Crates crew (of which Fat Joe was a part of - Big L is easily my favorite rapper of all time). While he was there he was easily the best rapper (he's WAY better than Fat Joe ever was or will be). What's great about \\"Lifestylez Ov Da Poor and Dangerous\\" is how fun, catchy, and hilarious it is - it's pretty unbelievable. My roommates and I quote lyrics from this and \\"The Big Picture\\" probably every day. Not only are the beats great, but Big L's voice, delivery, and lyrics are so good you can't help but wish he was still alive today (his lyrics, especially, make re-listening to the songs extremely well worth it). Big L is essentially all about the jokes - the best way one could describe the album is as \\"comedy-rap\\". The most of the album is basically Big L dissing people, but he also talks about gangster life and life as a rapper pretty ruthlessly and vividly (but not as contraversially as, say, N.W.A. I would say). Basically, if you're even just a minor rap fan then there's no possible way that I could imagine you not loving this (and it even has some appeal for non-rap fans). Overall this is just a MUST own rap album!    Highlights include:  the whole album!
B0002858YS|4.0|i love this album. I normally don't listen to soft stuff like this, but i enjoyed it. I recommend it  nice change over the Korn SOTD and disturbed that play on the radio ove and over.
B00008BRB5|5.0|At first one will write this off as being nowhere near as classic as \\"Zenyatta Mondatta\\", but give it some time and every song will grow on you. The album starts off slow with the first 4 tracks not instantly catchy or memorable, but it becomes great starting with the song \\"Synchronicity II\\". As is usual with The Police, Sting still has a great voice (though a little weak on this album), and the lyrics are all very well written and interesting to pay attention to. The music is, once again, incredibly clean and well done. The only problem this album has is that it's arguably harder to enjoy the rest of the album when you're used to classics such as \\"Every Breath You Take\\" and \\"Synchronicity II\\". As was the case for me, you'll probably be expecting every song to be as good - they're still very good, but they're most likely going to grow on you. Overall it's another very well done Police album that I think most people in the world will love! Absolutely recommended! <br /> <br />Highlights include:  <br />\\"Synchronicity II\\"  <br />\\"Every Breath You Take\\"  <br />\\"King Of Pain\\" <br />the rest are great, too
B000BBYMA2|5.0|Battle Royale is set in the near future, and Japan is out of control. Unemployment is at an all time high. Teenagers are boycotting school, physically abusing their teachers, and others that actually go to school are always truant, so the government decides to pass the BR act. A class of teenagers are drugged and are sent to an abandoned island and are forced to kill each other within 72 hours, leaving only one person alive. They all get a weapon, as well as a bag containing food, water, and a map. Their \\"sensei\\" (teacher) gives updates every six hours, detailing where the \\"danger zones\\" are, and who has been killed recently, or killed since the BR began. Now, they have the option to get revenge on someone they despise, and have to sacrifice their friends in order to stay alive. Who'd have thought a bunch of school kids slaughtering each other would make such an incredible movie? Recommended.<br /><br />As for the DVD, Apparently Toei (the copyright owners of the film) hasn't licensed it to a US distributor and they've rejected a few offers. The movie was a huge hit in Japan and Toei figured they'd get a big theatrical release in the US and decided to wait until they did. Unfortunately the movie was made in 1999. Anybody remember what happened that year? Columbine. So as you can imagine, it was a while before any US distributor would even think about releasing this movie. By the time the heat from that wore off, the region zero and bootlegs were all over the place and distributors saw the value of a DVD release but not theatrical. Toei wants a U.S. theatrical release before the U.S. gets an official DVD release.<br /><br />For more information:<br />[...]
B000002NFM|5.0|If you want to hear the best big beat on the basis of fun, \\"The Fat Of The Land\\" is the best there is. Sure, The Chemical Brothers' \\"Dig Your Own Hole\\" was very interesting musically and Fat Boy Slim's \\"You've Come A Long Way, Baby\\" has some classic big beat songs, but every track on \\"The Fat Of The Land\\" is amazing. They also decided to fuse a lot of the tracks with hip-hop which is a very welcomed idea as it makes them much more accessible and entertaining. While all three albums are monumental and essential to have (\\"Dig Your Own Hole\\" not as much), if you're only interested in the fun factor and not the musicianship then \\"The Fat Of The Land\\" is what you need to buy. Highly recommended (especially for the price! $10.00 is a STEAL!)! <br /> <br />Highlights include: <br />the whole album!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I think this is the best Madonna album yet. I have been a closet fan of Madonna (fearing ridicule from peers). But when I heard samples of \\"Hung Up\\" and viewing the music video, I ran out to purchase a copy. \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" is a great album.
B00006BTCA|5.0|This is one of those albums that once you listen to it you can't possibly live without it. Every song here is an indie rock gem, and you aren't going to care that it's not very original. It does borrow heavily from the likes of Depeche Mode, The Cure and Echo & The Bunnymen, and the singer sounds depressed as hell, but it actually enriches the album. The lyrics are also pretty depressing (ESPECIALLY on \\"Obstacle #1\\" - \\"but it's different now that I'm poor and I'm aging, I'll never see this place again, you'll go stabbing yourself in the neck\\"), but the music fits it perfectly. The musicianship is indeed wonderful and extremely catchy - most every song instantly reels you in. Daniel Kessler's voice perfectly fits the attitude of the songs, and a lot of recent bands have rightfully been copying his style (the recent band She Wants Revenge being the worst offender). If you're looking for a catchy album that also has depth and value then you won't go wrong with Interpol's \\"Turn On The Bright Lights\\". Highly recommended!    Highlights include:  the entire album!
B000056NX5|1.0|Oh, my.   <br /> <br />If you like the original (Brit) cast recording, I'd recommend borrowing this from the library so you can have a good laugh.  The 73 film version is a freak-fest, but at least it's of the era, and the singing ranges from good to excellent (in the case of Judas).  And it mostly rocks.   <br /> <br />Since the advent of the Broadway versions, however, JCS has stopped rocking.  And for that I am very, very sad.  Since Broadway got a hold of it, all of Jesus's rock-screamer high notes are now warbled as if sung by a soprano in a production of Cats: this version follows that lead.  And the visuals in this version are mostly awful.  This looks like a cross between a Kajagoogoo video, an episode of 21 Jump Street, Fame, and an 80s gay porn movie (arcane references lost on younger viewers:  but then, so are most of the visual references in the film).  I say this without the slightest trace of homophobia.  In fact, I think it's sort of interesting to play Jesus and his disciples as gay, and the lyrics of the musical do support the possibility. I can imagine a version that would be quite interesting and radical.  This one's just lame.  Jesus looks like Robert Plant in a wifebeater.  Simon the Zealot is in fingerless gloves.  Judas is wearing a motorcycle jacket and looks like Rob Corddry from the Daily Show doing an impression of Rob Halford.  Pilate looks like a Tom of Finland drawing.  It's such a bizarre, dated set and costuming....and overacted as if being performed on a stage in an amphitheatre. <br /> <br />Musically, it is weak. The vocals are so far in the front that one can't hear the band/orchestration.  Purists beware for more reasons than this:  lyrics are inexplicably changed.  Come one:  you can't take out the line \\"Jesus is cool\\"!!!  Even more lyrics are changed than in the Broadway version. <br /> <br />Seriously, this is cringeworthy.  If you want a film version, go for the classic with all its flaws.
