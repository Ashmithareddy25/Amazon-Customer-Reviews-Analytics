6305622914|5.0|I've seen this movie several times, I enjoyed it that much.  Very funny and great acting.  Love all the characters!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|You'll love this game! Graphics are well designed. Has lots of interesting features like power ups and boosts, similar to temple run, but with the Despicable Me flair.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|do not waste your money, movie not worth watching. slow, many holes. rather watch a good movie, don't watch bye
B005544TRQ|5.0|And that does not happen often! My favorite character is Donna. We will start watching 1 and by the end of the night we ended up watching 3.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The multiple story lines hold my interest, Maggie Smith is wonderful, I will be watching season 3 shortly, getting caught up for season 4.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|If you like all of the Marvel superhero movies, you'll love this one!<br />You can take the whole family to see it!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game was more of a challenge then some of the other escape games I have played but easy enough where I didn't get frustrated.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King truly outdid himself with this book. I couldn't put it down until the end. Excellent book I recommend to any fan.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This is a great app and very realistic! I am very impressed with how specific each gun is in love this app!
B000SEI230|5.0|A great read! I cried and cried:( Jamie certainly has changed my view of what love is. I would strongly recommend this book.
B004J4WKUQ|2.0|Good story, but very clumsily written, and half the plot points are deus ex machina solutions. Nonetheless the story is fundamentally a good idea.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Awesome!! Very dramatic scene selections. Keep me coming back for more. I didn't want the season to end. So glad it was offered on my kindle fire.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Couldn't quite give it five stars because I have seen better movies.  But it was very entertaining and kept you guessing. Will definitely recommend it to others.
B000KIPT30|1.0|i've never liked behringer but figured i'd give them a shot with this headphone amp. but it was a bad move, i have to plug my input cable in half way in order to get sound and even when i do that it still cuts out audio in pro tools. entire tracks can't be heard because of this thing, so when i switch back my headphones to my mixer i can then hear everything in my mix. never again behringer, not only are your headphones crappy your headphone amp sucks as well.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|Total tribute to those rambunctious, rowdy characters of the American West. Loved all the songs. Then again it's Volbeat -- what's not to love.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book is a fun read.  Not as complex as the original or his novels like IT etc but it's a book that offers substance for reflection, if you want to pause and think, but doesn't require that if you are here strictly for the thrill.  Great book
B003TTKB5I|5.0|I had never watched the series on tv. I don't know when shows are on and usually I'm too busy doing something else. This is definitely the way to go. As for Grey's Anatomy,it's a good show with great characters. The concept is a group of new interns in their first year at a teaching hospital. The story is about their lives and loves,  who knew that young surgeons were that horny? At first it's cute but gets a little soapy.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Got this as a free app of the day. I have several white noise-type apps and this is the best one for getting to sleep due to the binaural beats. It has six binaural beats ranging from 2.5 Hz to 20 Hz. The only downside about using binaural beats is that you have to use headphones or ear buds, but that would probably apply to most or all binaural beats apps.<br /><br />This app also has a fairly good selection of other sounds such as white noise, etc.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|This is such a good story. Dennis Lehane has a way of putting you right in the middle of this creepy place. So good!
B005LAIIMG|5.0|I hated the book....i mean despised it! I was so surprised by this movie. The first 5 minutes was better than the entire book.  I recommend this movie to anyone who hated the book an decided not to see the movie because of it. Take a chane you'll be glad you did.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|Like many here, I am a long time King reader. Purchased this book without knowing the subject matter, as I usually do with King novels. I enjoy reading what he has to say regardless of the story. While I truly thought the story was bland, it's his characters, his story and he can do whatever he chooses. Having said that, I felt as if I was reading a book by someone else. The prose, flow and dialogue just seemed &#34;off&#34; to me and I had just finished 11/22/63, which I loved. Maybe King should have let his son, Joe Hill, write Danny's story
B004ZH66XO|3.0|There are some simple abilities that you earn as you progress. However, the difficulty from level to level varies dramatically. It'll be fun for a little while, but once you learn the patterns the other fish do, it becomes really easy.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a wonderful addition to my Kindle Fire. but I can't figure how to download so it can be used with WiFi....
B00785P2QC|4.0|And I mean just that! We all have those games that we play that consume our time but are pointless. Virtual city dies just that. So whether you're trying to kill five minutes or an hour, this is the game for you. Takes a little time in the beginning to get city coins, but after you reach about level seven,you should have decent cash flow.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Sometimes the old classics can be expensive...however this one is totally worth it. Brought back some nice memories from when I was younger.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love, love, love this app! Very addicting. You can search anything: recipes, holiday ideas, kids, quotes, religion. A must have!
B00005JKDR|5.0|This movie is so funny and cute. Its great for young and old alike, all will enjoy it! Please buy this one to add to your collection.
B00000J2SP|4.0|After Rainbow lost Dio he was replaced with Turner. His voice range not as great as Dio but very good.
B003UESJF6|4.0|This movie is so fun and humorous, lots of action as well. Kids and adults will both enjoy this one.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Fun game for free.<br /><br />It is difficult to be patient for energy to restore. Only other issue so far is that it can be difficult to find some of the items. Then again, if it was easy it would be boring.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|This is a wonderful Disney movie. It is a funny, action packed movie that kids will enjoy watching with their family.
B0070YDOT8|1.0|It won't let me join a slot machine shut the whole game down to my home screen it suck not to play it otherwise I would give 5
0767836324|5.0|Hook is a more modern classic. We love this movie! Robin Williams is brilliant as Peter Pan, this is a fun movie all in the family will enjoy.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Why did it have to end. Can't wait for the next book to come out. I hope they do the tv show
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This movie is sooo funny! We love it, it was instantly one of our favorites, we recommend it not only to families with children, but to adults as well.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Unlike other games this one is fairly fast moving . I enjoy it very much! I would recommend this as in the best of any of my other games.
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|From the drunken U-boat sailors stopping the captain's car and then the veiled insult from the heroic captain, Thomsen this film grabs you and never lets go. All the details you'd expect from a major production are inside the U-boat. All the tension, horrific living conditions and general gung-ho attitude of men who had very little chance of surviving their patrol spread before you a realistic view of what being a U-boat sailor was all about. Don't expect a happy ending.
B000I9TXK6|4.0|A good movie about a love that just can't get it together.  There is one scene early on, as I suppose there must be, that leaves you with absolutely no doubt that these two young men began a sexual relationship.  After that, it is implied (i.e., you see them laying in bed together from the chest up, nakedness implied, but after that first initial scene when the sex happens there is no more implicit sex.  This allowed me to put the sex in the background and concentrate more on the &#34;star-crossed lovers&#34; aspect of the film which is, indeed, a tear-jerker of a chick flick.  I don't think most homophobic &#34;real men&#34; are going to necessarily enjoy this movie - - it is not a fast-paced action flick, it's much more emotional, but I liked it enough to buy it on Kindle so I could watch it a couple times a year.  To me anyway, worth a repeat watch, especially if I'm feeling soulful and sad anyway.  This is not a &#34;happy&#34; movie overall.
B009GI8J1O|3.0|I really enjoyed a Thousand Autumns (which I can highly recommend) so I had high expectations for this book. It is a well written book, but too much form over substance to my taste.
B00E3BK0QQ|3.0|Wish the game really was free its a shame to get into a game only to find out you be able to finish it.
B0047DVHV2|5.0|This is a really interesting read, even if you are not a die hard Stones fan. It is written as if it is Keith Richards talking. Not polished but casual and fast moving. It is a very honest honest book, even when he tries to gloss over his short comings. For example, when he tries justifying stealing Anita Pallenberg from Brian Jones, he does it halfheartedly - apparently with a lingering sense of guilt (but that maybe just my interpretation). Other parts I really enjoyed are where he talks about song writing and the sound his looking for and his relationship with Mick Jagger. Obviously, it is he take on their relationship but you do seem to get a sense of the dynamic that is going on. The end of the book where starts dwelling on bangers and mash, a safari in Africa, falling from a tree, etc. I found less interesting, although it was entertaining enough to finish. Overall, a very enjoyable and interesting read! One of the bios of a musician I ever read.
B008QZ1ZYQ|4.0|It's fun and challenging I would recommend it to a friend<br />It's hard to beat on some levels and a little kid might feel bad for the bugs but overall it's great
B00DJ80VLS|3.0|I love DT. Their last effort \\" A Dramatic Turn Of Events \\" ( ADTOE ) is my all time favorite disc from them. But this disc. . .well, that's another story.<br />Don't get me wrong, the newest material is strong and without a doubt, contains some fine songwriting. So, why the three stars? Well, ADTOE had more variety to it, in terms of songwriting themes, chops and sounds. It was more of a thematic movie for my ears. Think more Yes and Pink Floyd. But this effort has more Rush and Metallica feel and sounds, mainly more on the Metallica side. I love DT and their metallic feel. But we get that on their previous efforts like \\" Train of Thought \\" and \\" Systematic Chaos. \\" I wanted to hear more mystical sounds ala Yes' \\" Close To The Edge \\" or even their own \\" Scenes From A Memory. \\" In fact, I felt there was a journey of rediscovery on ADTOE that I haven't heard from the band before, possibly due to the departure of Portnoy. The band comes close to that journey again on tracks like \\" Illumination Theory \\" and \\" Along For The Ride. \\" But I guess I was expecting more sonic exploration which is found in spades on ADTOE. The hidden track on \\" Illumination Theory \\" is a welcome surprise as well. However, disappointed as I am with this release don't let my opinion stop you. If you want a full tilt soundtrack to crank up loud, this is the release for you.
1416595236|5.0|Someone gave me a copy of a Vince Flynn book to read and I loved it. Mitch Rapp is my kind of character - no small talk, high action, gets the job done. Vince Flynn has legions of fans because his books are great reads. I like lots of different kinds of books, and this one by Flynn is my current favorite. I'm a take no prisoners sort of person, so Rapp is right up my alley. In another vein, if you need help in your prayer life, get Lin Tomasso's new book Prayer Warrior: How to Get Your Prayers Answered. I downloaded it to my laptop (you can download it to your computer or any other device) for $2.99 at smashwords.com. The author will make you lol with her real life anecdotes while she guides you through how to word your prayers so they actually work. I saw quick results because I corrected my mistakes and walah, things started working right for a change. I highly recommend both these books though very different, both authors did a great job. I predict great things for Lin Tomasso. We'll all be hearing about her very soon.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What a great series.  I love the dystopian world she built while at the same time building characters that you can empathize with.  Worth the read.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|I almost didn't finish it. At 44% on my Kindle the protagonist's self-absorption and hopscotch thinking was just too much. I started skipping chapters and found that I didn't miss a thing. This book could have been wrapped up in 100 pages. I liked a Silent Wife much better.
B00BEEKN26|5.0|I purchased Broadchurch because I am a fan of David Tennant and a fan of British mystery.  This series had an interesting plot, the entire cast was excellent, and the location shots were beautiful.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Accessing the internet means getting junk files that just take up room, which creates a problem since tablets do not  have much space. Running this cleaner has restored a lot of space. It is easy to use, fast and efficient. It even provides a message that the user can remove even more stuff. I recommend it for all Android users.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Different story.  Kept my interest the entire time. couldn't wait to read the next chapter. I'll definitely read the next one.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Install and setup of this device was easy.  Playing YouTube videos from my laptop, tablet or phone works great.  Given that the YouTube experience is very poor on most devices except my TiVo, it's great to finally find a device that plays them without stuttering and re-buffering.  The Netflix app is quite nice too, although the app in my PS3 is was always serviceable.  For $30 it's a neat little device to tinker with.<br /><br />Seriously though, they need to rolling on some new apps for this device.  I've had it for about two months and had expected that Pandora and a few others would have been released by now.  Until then it's still just a toy with a lot of unrealized potential.
B00FEHXISA|1.0|this is not HD, poors image and sound, i only saw the movie for 20 minutes, i suppose will see the movie through other providers, just tried how works amazon movies streaming, no more!
B00EP0KBXM|4.0|Wow! After Earth had me out of my seat with excitement, Jaden Smith did a wonderful job in his role, I look forward to his future films.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Several unforeseen twists to the story line.  Great mix of personalities and emotion.  Many challenges and surprises.  Question, how long can the story go on..  They will have to be very creative!
B0017QSZW6|5.0|Hot<br />Very hot<br />Smokin hot<br />Drilling hot<br />Burnin hot<br />Hot hot hot<br />Oh did I mention hot?<br />Natalie Dorman - hot
B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved the book up to the end.. Then it was WTF, Don't end the story like this!?!?!? The has to be more, right?
B00DIJQAI6|5.0|Sonic and Sega all-stars racing is a game almost just like Mario kart! It is very fun. The  is the actual game. It is not fake or just pictures.. This game is very well worth getting, plz don't look at the other review posted. This game will bring lots of fun to your kids! :-)
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|keep on with the birds!  I love all angry birds games! How about a angry birds &quot;back to the future &quot;?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I thought it was adventurous and my kids love playing it. It couldn't get any better than this. Loved it too much for words to describe. I was  even playing it when my kid  we're at school!
0895260131|5.0|Robert Spencer is a real expert in understanding, comparing and contrasting the differences between Christianity and Islam. This book is a real eye opener for the world to understand and wake up!
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|My mom and I rented this from redbox this mom was good but not the greatest movie I have ever seen. I am glad I saw it but I will not watch it again
B000ITF86E|5.0|Felt like it was the first time seeing this movie again.  The sound and picture were great - all the way to the end.  Love John Wayne totally.
B00F5FBE82|5.0|Picked up right where he left off, and made an even better album... consistently putting out the best and giving the fans everything but disappointment
B00CATSONE|5.0|Not enough people are reading this book. I learned just as much about Edison as I did him and did not like what I learned about so many institutions that control us today. More should read this book.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Addictive from the start. It's a great series and definitely picks up during season 2. Overall, well-paced and very entertaining.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|I did not love what I learned but the book kept me going. It had an impact on my political views for sure.
B00F5BON8O|5.0|She gets better and better. First 2 Albums Like Napalm and bunker buster. THis album like a Hydrogen Bomb. Sarah you're awesome. And thank you...again.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|It was great, entertaining. Worth watching, good to see all the Avengers working together.  Looking forward to a sequel next year.
B006TF6WAM|1.0|I chose this book because it was by a new author and the title grabbed me.  I found the concept interesting but too sentimental for my taste.  Well written though and I look forward to reading her next book.  I have recommended it to my friends .
B001XUPD94|3.0|not one of the better plots, it is well made but not that interesting.  Worth the watch only to give continuity to the series of movies.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Having read all of the other Cousins War books I read this one after watching the tv series The White Queen.  Loved the book as it continues the family story but although I loved the tvseries I thought it was quite badly miscast - apart from Jacquetta and Warwick.
B001XUPH9K|4.0|this is real classic Star Trek.  well written and produced, even though it shows it's age in many ways it is a quality movie well worth the time.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Thank you, my friend, for recommending this book. Teenagers, critical illness, death. But really thoughtful. Grabs you and you can not put it down.
B001XUPGLY|4.0|This movie is so dated it is actually funny.  but for a star trek movie it has an interesting premise and is unique.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|The first real sequel King has ever written, it was kinda odd returning to Danny after so many years. Now I know some people would argue that the Dark Tower books are sequels but since it is one long story, same characters and an actual short time period, I have never considered them as such. All in all not a bad book and (thankfully in my opinion) this story gets right to it. My major complaint about The Shining is that it takes forever to get going.
B00AYB1RGG|2.0|I went into the movie knowing not to expect much, in some ways it was better than the first, but in a lot of ways it was just dumb and much of the acting sucked.
B001VU1NJ0|4.0|This movie kept me interested throughout the entire movie. I just didn't like the ending! Not that it was a badly written movie. I'm just probably the only one who wants justice to prevail in the end! It was a good movie though.
B007EC27QM|5.0|The ability to have a running total, look-back a former entries, and make corrections easily make this an excellent calculator to have. The only draw-back is no square root key.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book went between past and present and kept me most interested.  The main characters are humble and honest people and you cannot help but like them and hope things turn out well for them.  I enjoyed this book!
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I enjoy the show very much and hope the series continues for many many years to come. Has alot of very good actors and actressin the series.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|A great book full of the most memorable and fascinating characters!  I never wanted this book to end because I didn't want to let go of the characters.  It was like losing friends and then being left thinking &#34;I wonder what ever became of them&#34;.
044024613X|5.0|After one month I am still wondering about this story. Was he or wasn't Jacob  guilty. And if he was was it because of some gene he carried that determined his actions? A wonderful book- one I am going to read for the third time to see what I missed. The court scenes are worth reading several times. Do kids today really act as those in the book? I certainly hope they are in  the minority. It surely has me thinking and  delving into the truth of the adage &#34;you are what your genes are&#34;.
B00138KFYO|5.0|I listen and I am once again twenty years old and in no hurry cause I've got all the time in the world to get things donw.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I like this TV series because it not only has humor but the story line is written so that you can relate to the love story building. Unlike Bones or Rozzali and Isles, this is a softer TV series and one that lets you build a relationship as the weeks (or dvds) are viewed. BTW, can't say that for the books. Maybe if the books had the same character names as the TV show they may read better. But I was not a fan of book one.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|Why did they take a great thing and ruin it.....By far the worst Iron Man movie ...... I was all hyped up to watch being an fan and a guy that grew up on comic books. Destroy Stark mansion with a couple of helicopters please , I am now some babbling over sensitive cry baby not my Iron Man
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Regardless of your believes this is not enlightening an interesting written story of Jesus of Nazareth. I highly recommend it.
B00340LM8C|3.0|Interesting as an historical movie, but story line is simple and outdated (by James Bond). Scenery was beautiful as is Grace Kelly.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Amazing game but do use headphones, otherwise you lose some of the experience. Some of the levels require zen-like patience but they are all possible. Addictive!
B005MVLI8A|5.0|The quality of these audio recordings are outstanding...better then CD.  If you're a Nirvana fan, this MP3 album is a must.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I would recommend this book to any King fan!  This is like the old books! Will buy hard copy for my collection. Have been a huge fan of Stephen King for many years and will continue to read all of his books. Love u King!
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I Love this show! Always delivers great episodes,  I send out a big thanks to Amazon for having it with Prime!
B005LJK3AC|4.0|How could it not be funny with this cast? I hope there is a sequel, well worth the money to watch
B006LSZECO|4.0|It is tense and  very upsetting, because  it has a most  unusual and disturbed character moving the story along. The rest of the characters have to react to what the latter does and are trying to have some kind of life without ending up in jail or being misunderstood. It is very well done. I had wished for a more definite ending but I think the way it is written is exactly what the writer wanted!
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|This is so much better than that! Kipling isn't deep or literarily significant - but that dude could really tell a story!
B0009RCPY8|5.0|. . but no music videos. It would have been nice to have had the promotional music videos included in special features for both, instead you get deleted scenes & a few Ghostbusters cartoons. Interesting but not extremely interested on the material we did get, would have very much preferred the music videos, but will have to settle for ending credits, however, even promotional songs still get shortened by other tunes. My, my, my. Who ya gonna call, YouTube!!!
B005FDWM6M|5.0|This is such a heartwarming and touching movie.  I remember watching this movie as a child, and I remember falling in love with the characters and the story then.  Now, each time I watch it, I fall in love with it all over again.  This is a great family movie, especially for young girls with big dreams and a big heart, but I believe anyone in the family will enjoy it.  It teaches valuable life lessons, which are lacking in so many movies made today.  Great movie for the family!
B008GXHOFW|1.0|I installed the program and began to play. It ran for about 5 minutes and just stopped. I have tried it again 4 more times and the program stops in the same exact place. Since there should be no conflict with other programs I have to assume that this program was not tested very well. I am going to ask for my money back. Shame on you for letting this program on your site.
B003MC5N28|5.0|I was surprised by the depth of this book as it is labeled YA.  The underlying themes were heart-felt and the characters moving.  I am looking forward to the rest of this series!
B00699SDR8|5.0|Sophie's World is a book that my professor had on a supplemental list.  I have an hour commute to school, so I look for books to listen to on the way to school.  Because of the dialogue in the novel, it was easy to follow the story with the voice.  The voice is more difficult to follow with traditional texts.  I really enjoyed the book and got a jump start/refresher on the traditional philosophical cannon.  So, the book is great and so was the listening experience.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Very dramatic good show. Not happy with the ending of 3. Matthew was my favorite. Glad people are getting along better downstairs.
B0089LOG02|5.0|What a beautiful story, so beautifully told.  I had not been aware of the Orphan Trains before.  Just fascinating.<br />I would read this author again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is fun and a challange all at the same time I think u should get this app if u don't have it right now
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Not the type of fantasy I like.  I don't care for monsters morphing to people and being so cruel to others.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I enjoyed Kite Runner much more than this book.  Hosseini's writing is always superb, but the organization of this novel made me jump back and forth trying to figure out where I was in time and what was the character's relationship to the story.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is good so far!I love I get to ride beauty it is so much fun.but I'm a little. conserned about that you have to pay.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I done some of activities for Spanish and love it.  It will teach you something if you have time to the sessions.
B00A17AD36|4.0|The Weekend is definitely cut from a slightly different cloth. While this isn't your typical R&B sound, it's not necessarily groundbreaking either. T-Pain mixed with old school P.M Dawn comes to mind. The beats flow well with his vocal style. Although some tracks share a similar sound, it doesn't really detract from the album as a whole. Definitely a bit of fresh air in the music scene.
B00F91G5BS|4.0|Cool super crazy fast zombies!!! Nonstop jumping and gnashing of teeth action, and Brad Pitt actually doesn't totally screw it up.
B00F5F0208|4.0|If you like his previous efforts, I think you'll like this one as well. There seems to be &#34;club beats&#34; compared to his other albums. For some, that may not be a bad thing though.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very good read couldn't put my kindle down I was captivated by the story line had on edge couldn't get enough
B004I9CXHW|5.0|Purchased for my Mk6 GTI for playing music off of a thumb drive. It performs the same job as the OEM adapter cable for a fraction of the price.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|watched this film several times already and see easter eggs in it thanks to you tube. thor 2 and captain america 2 got big shoes to fill now before avengers sequel
B005HED11Y|5.0|The season series obviously is great. It was so easy to access the three seasons.  The listing of the episodes made it easy to select the episodes to watch. I had ordered the new Star Trek movie.  I used the episodes to remind me of the details about Khan. Watching both was great.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|this was a wonderful ending to that chapter in the family saga... Hope and can't wait for the next installment of the new generation... Hope they make a tv series out of this book..
0767830555|5.0|Had to do a report for film class so I deceded to do it on this classic.  This movie has some great artists and I thought &#34;why not buy it for my collection&#34;.  I've glad I did.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I just wish that jace and clary were not brother and sister they share a great connection but they cant do anything about it because they r brother and sister
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so awesome  but I would really love to have some Zombies for<br />creative mode No creepiest the creative and this is coming from a 8 year old girl that loves to play Halo
B009AMANBA|1.0|Lincoln was a monster who should have been killed before he had a chance to kill 700,000 men and boys of both sides.  He is revered only because his side won the war and future generations are educated by the winning side.  Slavery was legal.  Secession was legal.  If secession was wrong, then the revolt against Britain to create the United States had far less justification because no Constitution allowed it.  When you hear the occupant of my White House criticize the President of Syria for killing his own people, think of Abraham Lincoln.  That violater of the Constitution insisted that the Confederate States of America were part of the United States of America.  Sic semper tyrannis.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Nice sharp graphics, accurate description of weather. It was easy to install. I have a cat and a dog that I feed everyday.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|I liked the look of the main alarm screen and I went with the pro version because I wanted to be able to select a music track to wake up to.  And while I can do this, the track selection is just a dump of every mp3 on my phone, of which I have thousands.  Not only that, the tracks are arranged by album but with no album title listed.  Alarm Clock Extreme, which I already had installed, is the only alarm app I've found that let's me select a music track where I can select that track by browsing by folder.  Other than that, it's a beautiful app that appears to offer other useful functions, like an optional current weather display on the main screen.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it and I th. . ink this game is going to go viral. And I love that we travel different places.

B000V6MQV4|5.0|Never realized how much I like all the songs on the album. Definitely a must buy for any maroon 5 fans.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book.  I will read it again, when I am losing or have lost someone I love.  The perspective on life, death, and love is wonderful.
140006922X|4.0|While I wouldn't necessarily agree with every conclusion Reza Aslan comes to, I very much enjoyed reading this book. It does a wonderful job of portraying the background and society in which Jesus lived and explains how he was understood by his own people, the temple leaders, and the Roman authorities. His account of the relationship of James and Paul is especially interesting and caused me to re-read some of Paul's letters where he refers to Judaizers, and the letter of James.<br />I had read and enjoyed Dr. Aslan's book on Islam, which I liked a lot and learned from, so I was happy to see this. As a Christian, I would love to be able to have a conversation with him on both books! There are plenty of end notes and this is a scholarly endeavor, but footnotes would have been more helpful. Elegant writing!
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|it is a very long last batteries for my HTC one. even it have a 2100 mA batteries. I take it with me and it will provide a almost 3days charge for my HTC
B005WTR4ZI|3.0|This is a good book for reviewing many of the problems that technology is creating as it \\"helps\\" us.  Millions of traditional jobs are being eliminated by automation, robotics and computer intelligence.  This is not necessarily a case of creative destruction where new opportunities will present themselves for the masses to occupy themselves with, we are approaching a point where anything we can do, the machines will be able to do better, as soon as a new skill is identified a machine will be fitted to perform it.  On the bright side, things will be plentiful, our needs will be met and cost little or nothing. On the down side, the only thing that holds a lot of people together is the discipline of work, without a demanding routine and the sense of self-worth that comes from accomplishing it, a lot of folks will come undone. There are a few that will turn to art, music, education, etc. ,and lead uplifted lives, but they may be minority, the majority may struggle and succumb to bad choices for relief (drugs, alcohol, see: rock stars, movies stars, lottery winnners!) Are world leaders considering this and planning accordingly? no! this is a good book at a good price for understanding the problems, but no one I've read, including these authors have any convincing solutions for what awaits us.
0385732554|3.0|All in all, The Giver was an interesting read. It was unconventional in its ways of storytelling and it took place in a dystopia that many tales steer clear of. In the Community, anything different or unable to follow the status-quo is discouraged, rather, punishable. Jonas, a young boy who is just about to turn twelve, is the main protagonist of this odd and twisted tale. It showing the walls he must overcome in order to unveil what he truly craved for in his life, as well as depicting many of the cruel realities of life. The story continuously shows the complexity of emotions and feelings and how a simple memory can change the outlook of one's future.<br /><br />In my opinion, this book did an excellent job of showing what another world would feel like. Or rather, it depicts a world where I am not granted with the same rights as I am in my current country. It gives a lesson in being grateful for what you have and it helps in learning to change the way things are if you are unhappy. Despite the confusing and strange ways of this story, I do recommend that it be read and understood because the themes provided are thought provoking for people of any age to view.
B00B4Z5J92|4.0|Fascinating (if a tad self serving) tale of the storied history of the LA recording studio, Sound City. Well worth watching.
B002RI9K5Y|5.0|No one writes about America, California in particular - like Steinbeck. With his pen he captured the busyness of towns that can no longer be felt as they were many years ago and yet we can catch a whisper of their grandness in his descriptions. His stories cross generations, define the framework of how America was birthed on the backs of dreamers, workers, those with luck and those without.<br /><br />I read these books when I was a teenager in the 1960s. Back then I held on to every word and when I journeyed to the great golden state, California, I felt that I had been there before, my grasp of the inner workings was bone-deep.  Fifty years later I am re-reading them, still so full of wonder yet musing at how life has changed so much, ie: racism, the separation of classes, people with disabilities (Of Mice and Men), itinerant workers (The Grapes of Wrath). Not only with technology but in how we see things today - a world away from the stories in these pages.  Yet the human heart and spirit remain the same.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Good show, lot of actors that show once in a while like M J Fox, he still has a way to make me laugh.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Best keyboard ever, I always use SwiftKey.  I don't much like the swipe to write option so I just disable it.  But it by far the best keyboard on the appstore.
B003F3FJQO|4.0|It was pretty good I just hated that so much klunk (lol) happened but otherwise pretty good book to read
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Season two gets even better.  Still well written and witty.  I like being treated like an intelligent viewer.  The plots are interesting, fresh and relevant. And the great looking cast is talented for sure.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|GRRM has captured my soul. This is the second volume and I'm still craving for more. I'm so glad I bought the eBook because I could open the Kindle app on my phone while waiting, or between meetings, and so on. The narrative is engrossing and the twists in the plot left me heartbroken and speechless. It's time for the third installment!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Suits is a well written and well acted program.  Who knew that such an intelligent show was lurking behind all that eye candy!<br />It is compelling and yet emotionally captivating.  What it is not is convoluted or self-serving.  I would recommend it to viewers of any age.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|MacGyver is the ultimate hero. He can THINK his way through anything instead of killing and destroying everything in his path and then the Government doesn't have to spend tons of money to rebuild everything.
B003CH9PTU|5.0|It is as good as advertised.i am watching from the beginning and I cant believe I missed it all these years.dumby
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Okay, so the minions are so cute! The costumes you can buy are awesome. You move your minion like you would in subway surfers so I think that's easier. There are a lot of different locations you can go to like El Macho's lair and the beach and places like that, it's really cool! The only reason that I gave the game 4 stars is the good costumes, you have to use these Gru coins which are few and far between in the game but on costume is 2,500 coins! You either have to play this game day an  night or pay a lot of money for one costume. I wish that the coin was a little more like temple run and subway surfers where the banana thing was the only 'coin'. Using the Gru coins...It's really hard to get enough to get a good costume...but that's all. Overall it's an awesome game! I reccomend it to everyone!...oh! The start up is slow sometimes especially in places with no WiFi. It has to download content? But it's not that big of hold up. This game is great though!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I always wanted this game and now I have it! I just think it needs an update :-/ buy it if you love the  scribblenauts series!
B0088W4YTK|5.0|Great show, wish it lasted as long as stargate sg1... This season and all the others get 5 stars in my book, worth the 45 minutes!
B003M6FGTE|5.0|so glad I have my Prime membership! No extra charge for being able to watch Glee from the beginning & catch up.
B003E88TKS|5.0|Love this movie. I think it is one of his best. A great cast all around. Highly recommended to mature audiences.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I thought that the book started slow and that it was just another fun read but the characters became more complex as the book progressed. And then the moral dilemma was revealed and that made me stop and think.  A great book club book for that reason.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Love the drama!  I'm glad I don't have to wait a week between each episode.  It's great to have the whole season that I can watch anytime.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Quick setup to learn that this guy doesn't have much in the way of features. No audio from plugins in Chrome tabs, iOS app is limited to Youtube and Netflix (of the apps I have installed). Not impressed at all. 720p is below my expectations, though the framerate is acceptable. Debating on returning it, or keeping it around to see how they do. Software's nascent, but out of the box, I really, really don't care to learn more, or &#34;try to get it to work.&#34;
B007ZI06FE|5.0|The series is a hoot. Bluebloods, werewolves, mechanical men and skulduggery. How much fun is that? Tons of fun for me.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Dry humor at its best. You just can't beat Fawlty Towers. I got this set as a gift for my father, he was overjoyed to finally have the set on DVD.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Easiest search system on the planet. Tried em all this one works best for me.<br />Personal preference I guess. Worth a shot.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My son loves this movie. Can't go wrong watching this, especially if you're a gamer. It has feel of the 8bit Nintendo days...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My husband son and I all love this game.  I am the most surprising because I don't play video games.  Get it, you won't be disappointed!!!!!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Very smart, well done, and intriguing. I can't wait to see more of the show. Let's see where they go...
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Chromecast is a brilliant concept but lacks the ability to &#34;cast&#34; most animated web content. You start Google Chrome (with the Chromecast extension enabled) and there is no problem in getting web pages to display on the television as long as the content is &#34;static.&#34; web pages that have various type of imagery available such as .pdf, and most video animated formats such as weather in motion, film clips of news events, movies, etc. do NOT display. Only U-Tube and Netflix display properly. Amazon movies and  Amazn TV do not work. Until Chromcast is better able to &#34;cast&#34; the web I would give it a 3 star rating.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Just a great show.  Wish they would do more, they need to strike a balance between not enough and too much.  The show is now moving too fast...I don't need to see the roaring twenties
B001DJLCRC|5.0|My family was addicted from the first episode!  The writing is so clever, crisp and unique.  The acting catches you up and doesn't let you go.  We would sit down saying that we were only going to watch one episode and end up watching three!  Time flies by and you are completely caught up in a story about an over-qualified high school chemistry teacher who gets a death sentence (lung cancer) and decides to cook and sell meth to make enough money to provide for his pregnant wife and his 15 year-old son who has muscular dystrophy.  When I heard that description of this series, I was under-whelmed and avoided watching it until the final season was set to begin...but my daughter talked us into it.  THANK GOODNESS SHE DID!  It is one of the BEST series I've ever seen on TV.  I highly recommend it!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The easier five stars ever.  Just great show with great cast.  The productions are well done as are the chacters....some of the themes are kind of corny.
B000Q6GUW0|4.0|What a clever premise!  A sociopath with serial killer tendencies is spotted at a very early age by a seasoned police officer (while the child is up for adoption).  The Officer adopts the child and takes the opportunity to carefully ingrain in him that he is ONLY to kill others like him...serial killers....who have managed to slip through the system and remain free.  Dexter learns to be one of the best blood spatter experts at the police station.<br /><br />This is extraordinarily interesting as Dexter narrates his inner most thoughts, and we get to learn how a sociopath, with no empathy or understanding of how \\"normal\\" people feel, navigates through society mimicking how people behave.  That is fascinating.  The acting is dead-on and the writing is crisp and taught.  My ONLY issue with this series is the foul, gutter mouth of Dexter's sister...it is so extreme that it feels like slaps in the face.<br /><br />Really good television.
B00BE97ONM|5.0|Jams N. Roses has a talent for walking on the dark side and I have no hesitation whatsoever in awarding `Son of a Serial Killer' five stars.<br /><br />Many years ago someone handed me a book to read with the words, \\"You might enjoy this.\\" I can't remember what it was called now but it covered the true story of couple who picked up hitch-hikers in the California / Nevada desert areas, raped them, tortured them and inevitably killed them. I had no idea why this person felt I would enjoy this book but out of duty I read it, and against my better judgement found myself being so drawn to the main character that I started to feel sorry for the rapist-killer.<br /><br />His upbringing was atrocious, and he was never, ever going to grow up to be a choirboy. Now as I set out to write a review of Serial Killer and not this other book, I mention this only in passing because Jams N. Roses has that same talent in that even though the reader knows the protagonist, Ben, is a killer he is drawn to him and desperately wants him to champion the evil forces within himself and return victorious.<br /><br />And it is these evil forces that Roses defines so well, for the author explores the dark side of schizophrenia with a rare talent. Schizophrenia can be an alarming and agonising condition and Ben finds himself journeying through a world that is barren, demented and persecuted by distorted consciousness. He is disgusted and frightened by the face in the mirror.<br /><br />However, if you think Ben is the only character in this book that is slightly unhinged, you're in for a treat. His girlfriend, Natalie, is a pure psychopath, working all the time towards whatever is in her own best interests with absolute no guilt feelings or capacity for remorse. She has no redeeming characters except her body which she uses to her advantage whenever she feels the need. The reader actually wants Ben to kill her.<br /><br />But that isn't all. Roses explores cruel and detestable people as well as those who, to be less than delicate, are completely off their rocker. I won't spoil the story by giving away secrets, but you've got the detective inspector with the ubiquitous hip flask, her superior who is, as expected, on her case to `crack the case' and the mentally ill mother.<br /><br />I thoroughly recommend this book.ose who, to be less than delicate, are completely off their rocker.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was a very enjoyable game with challenging puzzles to figure out - just wish there were more than ten levels to play.
B00CATSONE|5.0|This book is great, as it addresses a normally overlooked, but extremely important historical figure. It also sheds light on the truth behind a corrupt but celebrated man.
B00F35BV64|5.0|I have been a &#34;treckee&#34; for many years.  It is wonderful to see the younger ones and do a mind comparison to the original crew!<br />Love the Movie!!
B00F8L2VO4|1.0|I haven't even got this app up and running yet.  It requires stuff that doesn't apply to the app.  What does it need a picture for.
B00F35BV64|5.0|I enjoy where they're taking the franchise. And particularly that SFX gas caught up to the stories. As contrasted with the original television series.
B0013ND30M|2.0|Product advertised NEW, definitely not! While the product did arrive in wrapped in plastic, making it look &#34;new&#34; the disc was horribly scratched before we ever put it in the DVD player. The second disc (Bonus disc, not the movie) didn't have a single scratch on it. I was so happy to have found this product on Amazon as Sleepy Beauty is my little princesses favorite Disney princess. She was so excited to open it on her 3rd birthday, she literally jumped up and down yelling SLEEPING BEAUTY!!! The disc does play with no glitches, so she doesn't care. I carefully reviewed sellers before purchasing items (also purchased another Disney vault movie) before I ordered either. And had similar problems with both. Which would be why I am writing this review. Please advertise your product honestly and price them as such. Would not recommend this seller!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This is a great movie pack. High quality product. A really great gift for the move buff in our family.
B0001I561E|2.0|While this product did arrive in plastic wrap, when we opened it, the disc had scratches all over it. When we get to chapter 16, it literally ejects from the the DVD player and reads error reading disc. My only fix has been to skip chapter 17, which will allows the remainder of the disc to play. It would be nice for my daughter to see the movie in its entirety. Wouldn't recommend going with this seller as I feel they had falsely advertised this product.
B007MJSSCY|5.0|Do the spirits of the people who lived before us know what we need and help us?<br />I really loved this movie and would recommend it to my friends and family.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is fun and God's your attention. I like the hidden banana areas. It's a game the kids can play to.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is by far a lot of fun. Creative, AWESOME graphics and nonstop laughter......everyone should try it out.. I play everyday and so do my kids
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Very good wish It came in a full version for a computer or PlayStation! I real get tired of games you have to spend real money to buy play money though!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I think it is awesome I give it a five star review i love this game so much I never put down my Kindle oh and dump world awesome idea and sometimes when I'm board I get on to this game OMG sooo fun right<br />I love it:)
B00BBIAB0Y|5.0|I have fallen more in love with Honor as I read more about her and can't wait for the next book.
B00CL0J99K|1.0|I don't watch much TV.  Don't go to movie theaters.  Don't check too many reviews.  After a long week at work, and having to extend a stay at work through a Saturday I was excited to see this delivery when I got home.  Nothing else went right this week, but hey - I get to watch the new Iron Man release.  This movie ended up being like everything else this week - jacked up.<br /><br />I've really liked the Iron Man series thus far and estimated this release would be good too.<br /><br />This movie was so bad I'll never pre-order another movie again.  I'll wait and check on reviews, etc. before ordering.<br /><br />I'll try to avoid any spoilers and not give too many examples to prove my point but this movie was horrible compared to the earlier releases.  I read some of the other reviews and everyone commented on how funny this was.  I guess I have a different sense of humor.  If I wanted funny, I'd buy a comedy flick.<br /><br />Compared to the previous releases action was non-existent.  When it did come up due to the story line I didn't even care.  I kept waiting through the entire movie for something to interest me or draw me in.  Only thing to spark my interest was the end of the movie.  The story line seemed to focus on an almost \\"I'm in a mid life crisis, whoa is me, does she love me\\" event.  Great.  Deal with it.  Go blow something up.<br /><br />I've called all my family/friends that really liked the entire series thus far.  Warned them this was a lemon and not to buy it or waste any time/money on it.  If they want to watch it, they can borrow or have my copy.  Something changed in this Iron Man release.  It's almost like someone wanted to generate the revenue from the movie but couldn't come up with a good idea at the time and released this garbage as a \\"place holder\\" until they come up with something better.<br /><br />As far as picture, sound, etc. my 1 star rating doesn't reflect because of anything like that.  Movie looked great, sounds great.  1 star rating is just because it's a really lousy movie.<br /><br />There may be some partial spoilers from this point on, so read on at your own will but I thought I better justify some of the above comments.<br /><br />- Predictable.  I knew too early on who the bad guy was.  Great.  How many movies have had the \\"picked on nerd guy\\" come back to be the bad guy.  Snore.<br />- The \\"supposed\\" bad guy was a joke.  Give me a break.  See comment above.  It was obvious he was just some clown.<br />- The K-Mart Iron Man versions flying around were horrible.  They left the impression someone could knock one out with a BB gun or they would fall apart on their own.  Maybe Iron Man set up a factory in China to make these guys.  I'm sure if I could zoom in close enough the \\"Iron Man\\" clones would have a Made in China stamp somewhere.  Really, why didn't they make the main character tough enough to be the hero?  Most of the so called action was a bunch of tin can Iron Man clones flying around and getting blown up.<br />- With all the references to Iron Man in the Avengers movie one would think it would have brought Iron Man to toughen up.  Not so.  It's almost as if he took two steps back and created suites that should have shown up in the \\"everyone else is years away from an Iron Man suit\\" section of the last movie.  This movie is an insult to even mention the Avengers movie during the screen play.<br />- I can respect involving the Iron Man's personal relationships into a movie.  But in this case it was too much.  The movie didn't do enough to draw me in to that.  The entire time I watched this I couldn't help but think - this is a guy just feeling sorry for himself when really he has nothing to complain about.  Iron Man having to blow into a paper bag?  Give me a break.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I've played this game for quite a while. I get addicted to it every time! Love it.I play it every day.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is so much fun to play. It is simple to play tor the most part. If you love the movie,  you'll love this game!
B00B2JSRAS|1.0|Well copywriter reads 'The Secret' and decides to double-dip into the pot of honey... but whole book is quite boring and with strong personal agenda.
B0042816YK|5.0|I LOVED THE MOVIE, AS I HAVE BEEN TO ITALY, INDIA, AND MANY PLACES IN ASIA.  I COULD RELATE TO THE EXPERIENCES SEEING HOW PEOPLE LIVE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD.  JULIA ROBERTS WAS HER USUAL WONDERFUL SELF AND SHE ENJOYED PLAYING THIS PART.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Very interesting look into the world of the recording industry and how it has changed.  Neil Young and Petty are interviewed, but don't watch this expecting to see a lot of footage from any one musician...it's a collection of many.
B00CFOGCAG|4.0|I love this old school retro side scrolling/runner hybrid. It's simple but extremely fun and challenging. The art style and level are also pretty cool. The combat system and game play as I said before simple but also unique and creative. nice job with this one
0553062182|5.0|Reading this book was like reading a book written by someone who finally \\"gets\\" me.  My mom asked for a copy so SHE could understand me!  I just wish there was a book about how to understand my mom.  HA HA  :)  Anyway, the insights within the book have given me some peace in understanding that there is nothing WRONG with me; in fact, just the opposite, maybe I am a little \\"special.\\"  The PERSONAL insights I have gained from reading it have helped me to be both more appreciative of OTHERS as well as myself.  Highly recommended.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|The action packed scences were good for most of the movie. Just not a fan of the Zombie flicks, even though a lot of my co-workers are. Gives me a reason to cut into there banter over there take on the movie. Was a couple dry spots, but good over all. I did not have to recommend it to my friends most of them have retired, my co-workers are in there 20's and earily 30's.<br />  Think there will be a couple co-workers who will want me to use my air-brush and special make-up to give them the look of a Zombie,(look-a-like) image. Why not its a lot of fun just as long as I'm not the person under all the make-up.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is a good read!  A story line with good twists and turns.  I totally enjoyed reading it. I recommend it.  Of course his best book still remains the only true story he ever told.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I could not put this book down.  Chris Kyle was a hero obsessed with a sense of duty.  He described his life in relatively simple terms but with clarity and precision, the precision expected of an American sniper.  If you have never been in combat, this will help you appreciate how it feels and what it takes to survive.  You will also see the high personal cost of unconditional dedication to a career.  Chris was one of the good guys and he will be missed.
B008469DGY|5.0|Fun game! Enjoyed from the first time used! The only thing I find as a drawback is there aren't many holes to play.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Great idea; fun story; good read. I typically do not read SKING, since I do not like psycho horror.  For that I can watch the news. But this was almost (the author couldn't help himself) devoid of violence, and tells the tale of the death of Kennedy from view of someone trying to prevent it. Personally, I wasn't thrilled with the ending. It got too weird, even for a magical 'back in time' novel. But the point is well taken.
B0060CV31C|5.0|This is a funny, smart adventure of a movie about friendship and self-reflection. Little kids will appreciate the physical humor, but older kids and adults will really get the message. It's one of our favorites!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was our September book club selection. A great read about the paths our lives are destined to take, or not take. We all agreed  The Husband's Secret was a gripping story, fast paced and an  easy read. Loved how the author tied all the characters together and made a beautiful cohesive story.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Well, my title for my review pretty much explains it... BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The best part is that it's free, even if it cost money I would get it and love it!
0440246318|5.0|Just as good as all of the Reacher stories that I have read !<br />Lee Childs is an excellent writer.<br />Just as I get to ready to put the book down at a chapter end, he makes it so compelling<br />I have to read just a little more into the next chapter.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|A fascinating peek into what North Korea may be like.  Riveting and scary - an excellent read.  The characters are a bit surreal, but the story line keeps you fascinated and imaging life in that country.
B00EQF0JJC|5.0|I am a great fan of the play and thought this was a wonderful adaptation of it. It was funny, sweet, and heartfelt the way Shakespeare is meant to be. If you dont like Shakespeare then obviously, you wont like this and if you are the type to only like the strict classic telling, then you wont like this. It brings the classic words to life and as a side note, it was great to see so many people from Joss Whedons other work if you are a fan.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome game to play. I get so sucked into the gameplay that I start yelling and screaming if I mess up. Super fun!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun Game! My Daughter Loves These Little Guys! Plus I Love That In The Beginning Of The Game It Ask For Your Child's Age!! Very Nice Picture to! Awesome!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I usually don't stay with games very long but, I've had this one on my Kindle Fire & my phone for awhile now.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|I Just Downloaded This Game Yesterday For My Daughter! It Took Up A lot Of Memory But Its The Bomb.Com......That Is All!!
B00632HWOG|5.0|Whenever I had yahoo mail I had this app on my phone. It's notifications are very accurate & it is very convenient.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is incredible!!!!!!!! If you like playing games where you have to return to them everyday and check on them,I would highly recommend this game for you!!! I absolutely love it! It's fairly easy to gain the world money and I have been playing for SEVERAL weeks now and I haven't had to buy anything using real money! It's wonderful and I love it! Please do not listen to any bad reviews, this game is wonderful!!

B009UAO1ZG|5.0|I was growing up at the time and did not fully understand the events that were occurring, But after reading Those Angry days I have a much clearer insight into those events,
B009O2XY12|5.0|It was very fun I liked it. I play it all the time and I enjoy it. I play it with my  family all the time.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This has never worked smoothly, ever!!!!! Now I need to add additional walmart words to satisfy you...give me a break...I do not need this nonsense.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|The name says it all, this is a really good game with lots of challenges for both young and old
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I bought this app and it is really cool you can compete, care, and dress your horse it is really fun you should buy it!
B0056CUZRA|4.0|This book was one of those few you find that once you start, you can not put it down.<br />It has a complicated plot with a large number of characters set in a time in history that is both intriguing and ominous.<br />A must read for anyone that likes a mix of romance, action and relevant history
B00EQ0CKRQ|3.0|Good fun game but constantly crashes and can take you pretty long to save up for some of the more expensive cars.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the characters. Great show. It makes me laugh, it makes me cry, I'm always so sad when I come to the end of a season.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app I don't have it on my kindle fire but I have played it on a ipad and iphone 5 and it works excellent!<br /> I LOVE IT ITS A GREAT APP! if u live minecraft that is....
B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved how the two stories tumbled over each other throughout the book.  They are so alike and yet so different.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love this series. It is a well produced show that I have watched over and over; and will again. Great characters, depth, well acted and put together; one of the best I have ever seen.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|LOL,this is the coolest game ever.but you have to promise not to play around trains OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK. You better<br />oooooooo oooooooooooooooooooooooooooookkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkOK
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is amazing. I couldn't stop playing it. It is my favorite game and I love how you can make and destroy things. You can even build your own house!
B00F91RYL8|2.0|Bloodless Hollywood action flick with irritating children in peril and nonsensical PG-13 violence. Read the book. Might have made a good miniseries.
B00CEZJT2E|4.0|The charger is a bit heavier than expected, but it does the job. I like the matt black finish of it, looks slick.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Love the show.  Gabriel Macht does a fantastic job as the arrogant but caring Harvey Specter.  The HD stream from Amazon Instant Video is great: great picture quality, great sound.
B00E981K1W|3.0|They should let know buyers of thee book that doesn't have a table of contents and you will miss parts that the regular book has. It is very annoying not be able to see the contents
B005PK57IK|4.0|This is a good series to turn to when you only have a limited time to watch TV but want to relax. The characters are interesting and the storyline is well written. A good consistent series.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I'm not that big into TV, but this show hooked me from the start. I just love this show -for so many reasons!
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|**Never any spoilers!!**<br /><br />There were times when I got into this book.  Sure, the stuff in it has been done before and will remind you of other works that you've read or seen (vampires, werewolves, magic).  The plot doesn't really bear mentioning, but at points the action flows smoothly and the elements the author throws together find their own flow.  But then something happens to snap you out of it.  There's something a little off about Ms. Clare's writing.  The humor is forced, actions and dialog don't quite make sense with the characterizations, and the wording can be odd.  For example, \\"The apple tasted green and cool.\\"  How does something taste green, or cool, exactly?  I get what she is going for, but it's not quite THERE.  The same can be said for the book.  I get what she's going for, but it's not quite THERE.  The parts that work are overshadowed by the parts that are boring or stretched.  Strangely, I want to see the movie, because I actually think this has a chance to be a better movie than the book if the film-makers can bring it all together with a little more clarity and even tone, and the actors can put a truer spin on the dialog and characterizations.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Dan Torrance shines  on, and King still has it going on. If the Shining was, amongst other things, his book of alcoholism, this is his book of sobriety. The questions arise: what if Jack Torrance had found AA? Would things have played out differently at the Overlook? Would he even have had to take his family there? But we know how that played out...<br /><br />And in Doctor Sleep we week \\"Doc\\" come full circle. Truly a tour de force.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|All members of our book club loved this book. Most said that they could not put it down. Although Jacob's situation is disturbing, the book is thought provoking and generated quite a lot of discussion.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|An excellent version of backgammon.  Plays well on my Samsung Galaxy Note II as well as my wife's Toshiba Thrive Tablet.  Plays full screen on both.  Love the preview of the moves.  If you love backgammon you will really love this version.
B00F1RR3Y8|5.0|i love this game! it is so interesting! it makes me feel like im in my own little nail world!
B004VOBIE8|5.0|Has all of the features that you need in a file manager.  Gives icon of picture files in listing.  Great for moving files and creating new folders.  Excellent menu bar at the top has all the functions clearly indicated.  A well written program.
B00E03ULJS|5.0|I loved this album. Krewella did a really nice job with the production of the songs and the lyrics as well. Not to mention, the singing - Jahan and Yasmine did FANTASTIC. My personal favorites are \\"Ring of Fire\\" and \\"Thunder & Lightning\\" *NOTE: \\"Thunder & Lightning\\" only comes with the iTunes exclusive album.*
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|I love the way this version plays.  The number you are working on is highlighted on the board making it easy to see the possibilities.  A real fun version to have on your smartphone.  Plays full screen on my Galaxy Note II as well as our Toshiba Thrive Tablet.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|Excellent as always from Cassandra Clare. Not my favorite of the whole series but still heart stoppingly amazing. I highly recommend it!!
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I am enjoying the new AbrahamsVerse because thats why I watch star trek.  The old Series was good in its day, but these are present day times...
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I find myself falling more in love with Eva and Gideon with each book. The complexities of their characters often makes for a tumultuous relationship but it in turn also creates the makings of a divine read. Sylvia you are my hero!
B007EE4XKI|5.0|Great Ebook, Keeps the Series Alive !  Great story, but David Mack is a great Writer !  Dont Stop reading !
B00338QENI|5.0|Well written. Worth the read from a human interest and historical perspective. I started to work in the medical field in the late 1960s just as informed consent was becoming wide spread.  The attitude then was why do we need to change, read this book you will know why.
B006SVHOL8|5.0|Perhaps because epidemiology has always fascinated me, I have a penchant for biological mass disaster movies.<br />Rather than focusing on shock factors or unnecessary gore, &#34;Contagion&#34; portrayed a pandemic that could very easily happen tomorrow. It focused intently on the manner in which our globalized society advances the spread of disease. I was very impressed with all the different angles portrayed- local clinic & hospital response/confusion in the beginning, CDC & WHO participation & coordination - but also the political pressures that come along with dealing with such an outbreak. The way our Western so called &#34;civilized&#34; society begins to crumble in the face of an epidemic, the terrifying personal ramifications of a modern day quarantine (such as states closing their borders), and how &#34;snake oil&#34; salesmen are still very much a part of our culture.<br />Five stars, two enthusiastic thumbs up, an educational experience that's extremely entertaining.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app the highest ive gotten is 219'016 anyway awesome app 5stars I am gonna get temple run 2 because this one is so fun I wish there was a temple run 3.ili
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|The cover fit my kindle fire perfect and I really love it and the price was awesome if only I could figure out how to download candy crush then it would be great any advise would be appreciated  on how to do it thanks
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is a great series. Replacement for Justified, but equally good. Can't wait to watch more. Harvey Specter makes this show.
B0063M22QO|3.0|Not exactly the same feel as on a PC, but still good. You don't always choose your format and the &quot;classic&quot; version doesn't give a score. Still, it's enjoyable and a fun challenge.
B002TXZRRM|4.0|I was reading the book while on a trip in Botswana.  Therefore it was a very complimentary way to read about the people there.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is great for accessing Amazon with better prices and eBook availability. Features work great and it's easy to come and go without losing my place.
B00CWM3F4C|4.0|There's a few standouts on the album, I liked tracks 2, 4, 8 and 9 the most so far.  I like how they mixed in material that could be on SAP or Jar of Flies with more traditional non-acoustic releases.  Overall I agree with most, it's better than their previous post-Layne album and more cohesive.  It definitely has the Cantrell-ey vibe and is heavily chorused, but that haunting yet lovely multi-part harmony is the signature AIC sound we all live for!
B00F8L2VO4|3.0|Could be a really good app but it stops working. Haven't been able to complete the first lesson.  If there's something I'm missing I'd love to know. If not, please fix the issue.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|This is more for children or those young in heart. It has a very cute story line where they have their differences, but in the end they are family (even though different species). They work together to come out on top against all the odds.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|you have to buy this movie it is so touching you want to cry after, a great lesson for kids
B005RUUUAI|5.0|You will love this adventure! My son is all about this apocalypse and the reality that something like this could actually occur. The program became addictive right from the first episode! The third Season is about to start and we are on the edge of our seats as we wait. Enjoy learning how they handle the lack of comforts they had been accustomed to while they try their best to have some kind of normalcy as they live to stay out of harm’s way. You never know what will be around the next corner! Enjoy.
B001FAFO3W|3.0|the picture is not that nice and fine like those walt disney movie if you want to go for the best, but the story is nice
B008PZZYB2|1.0|The plot and content were as deep as Zoolander,s I.Q. I wouldn't bother with watching it again. Stiller is capable of so much more.
B00009ZYC1|4.0|well, it's shrek, you can't go wrong with it, funny and great to watch, not talking about the donkey and cat
B0050DIWFC|5.0|It's been a while since I've read such a well written and suspenseful book. What I loved most was that it was not predictable. I would highly recommend this book! My book club loved it!
B0011ZNAIC|4.0|a cute movie for kids, very nice picture, pretty meaningful movie too, great for both adult and kids to watch
B005QYKE2Y|5.0|This third installment of the franchise maintained the expected levels of intense action, and then some! Additionally, the complexity of the story line  has also been amplified beyond the prior two movies!!! Excellent entertainment!!!
031606792X|3.0|ok I love it at first, but it get bored if you want to read it again, the whole story is shallow
B000069KE0|5.0|CD  Is Fine Looks and plays Fine,  I only Like the First 4 CDs of Chicago  Terry Kath Made the Band. After he Died Chicago  became a Ballad Band over and over many people Like them Just not for me.  Gary Sturm
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love kindle!  I love having access to classics and the latest releases.  I love being able to haul it all around with one hand.  I love that it will sinc what you have read on one device with your other devices.  I love that so many books are available: children's, young adult's, contemporary, classics, etc.<br />I love this!!!
B00328G4V6|3.0|This Was not the album I thought it was going to be its OK, I am Glad to have it I am A Die Hard Fan I want More of what they are sitting on Release all of  Band of Gypsys They put on Four shows.  Gary Sturm
1439148813|5.0|This is such a great book. I found myself sweating along with the members of Mission Control in every episode -- Mercury though Apollo.  The technical detail is especially appreciated by those of us who are engineers or have worked on critical projects like the NASA programs.  I know that some were not happy with the publication of this book.  It showed how close to disaster we came on so many missions.  Still, it left me darn proud to be an American.  Our astronauts and people behind the scenes at Mission Control are true Amercian heros.  Well done, Gene!
B000JCSPG0|4.0|I never saw this before. I liked it very much. Kurt Russell and James Spader a couple of my favorites.
B00571F26Y|4.0|I am no body-scientist... I wouldn't know a protein if I fell over it. But William Davis presents a compelling argument that we should better understand how the food we consume breaks down into the elements used by our body in its daily metabolism. If his theory is correct, he is presenting insights that can have immediate impacts on a number of ailments that cause widespread suffering in our community.<br /><br />If you are feeling unwell from causes unknown, I'd suggest you read this book. If you have friends or relatives who suffer from digestion complaints, I suggest you read this book.<br /><br />The claims made by William Davis are so important, he needs to build around him a circle of recognised food experts who can corroborate his claims.
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|Very clever physics based game where you have to draw lines on the screen to redirect the flow of sugar. It gets progressively more challenging, but never so much so that you want to quit.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Well itmakes it very easy for me to use my Yahoo account while I am reading I don't have<br />use two devices. Plus its easy.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|It's a great game but blow doesn't work. Make blow work. It's annoying when you blow but it doesn't work.
B003M696QS|5.0|This book gives Intelligent  and thorough answers to all the questions we have about the hereafter and various phenomena people have expeienced.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I enjoyed the book for the most part. It may have been better if I had read it constantly over several days. Since I had breaks between reading, I found it confusing and was hoping at some point all the characters would be tied together in the story.
B001ENS0BI|3.0|Video quality was great. However. Story line is a little weak. Definitely the weakest of the four seasons. Season 1 & 2 get you hooked making you finish up with 3 & 4.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Very entertaining and addictive. It becomes a bit predictable over time but this doesn't seem to detract from our enjoyment of it.
B00000DNCF|5.0|If you think &#34;Black Hole Sun&#34; is awesome, or if you think it's &#34;just okay,&#34; then maybe this album is not for you.<br /><br />But, then, maybe it is.<br /><br />This is the band's breakout, not breakthrough, album.<br /><br />It takes the music and lyrics and vocals more seriously than ever before and after.<br /><br />This is &#34;Black Hole Sun's&#34; evil brother.<br /><br />The highlights here are:  &#34;Drawing Flies.&#34; The song that makes lazy people realize they're lazy, basically.  &#34;Sitting here like uninvited company, wallowing in my own obscenity...&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Rusty Cage.&#34;  This song is SOOOO EXTREMELY HEAVY.  But you can hear what the man is saying, and you can hear actual notes in the song.  So maybe it's not as heavy as today's &#34;heavy.&#34;  But listen to this song, if you haven't already.  You just want to get out and break something.  And the slow breakdown at the end is superb.<br /><br />&#34;Slaves and Bulldozers.&#34;  Chris Cornell's undeniable vocal pinnacle.  He's (probably) never reached another high like he does in this song.  It's ear-splitting chaos, from his voice to the raw guitar riffs and bass line, not to mention the drums' ability to MAKE you want to bang your head.<br /><br />You'll be getting whiplash in zero seconds, flat.<br /><br />Trust me.<br /><br />This is the end-all be-all to melodic metal records.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|Loved the movie. This had more drama then I was used to seeing from Tony Stark. Yes he loved Pepper Potts and showed it this time but I wanted more bad boy.
B005QBKXOQ|5.0|I myself am not a fan of Daughtry, but my daughter is.  She wanted this album and is thrilled with it.  I came in CD form and also as a digital download for her to have on her digital music players.
0446547654|4.0|I can definitely see this book turned into  a movie. Another hit by Nicholas Sparks.  I recommend this book, I am sure you will thoroughly enjoy it.
B00E1SM5UA|5.0|So often we listen to musicians record tribute albums that merely lay-down the original's melody in a marginally new manner--copying, really. Not so with Di Meola's latest. You hear songs that are completely his sounds, and are at the same time true to the originals by Lennon & McCartney. There is not a cliche anywhere, and these interpretations reflect soul and thought--again, not copying. The musically literate may correct me, but this album may be more like rhapsodies on the themes of these Beatles songs. I compare them to that form because what Di Meola has done is so far above just covering other people's music. Maybe this is also in the same vein as what Miles Davis did with songs like Some Day My Prince Will Come, etc. I sure wish DiMeola would come out with a new album every 11-12 months. This one is a masterwork, and it might finally get him the wider recognition in the US that he deserves.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I bought this CD for my mom and have listened to the songs myself.  Josh Groban's voice is simply enchanting.  She is enjoying this music on this tape.  I am going to have to buy this tape for myself.  As an aside, my youngest son could be a body double for Josh.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Once you accept the premise that zombies can exist, this becomes a tale of love,terror and the human spirit like few other books I've ever read.  Loved it.
0805047905|5.0|If you want an entertaining book to teach young children their colors, this one is a delight.  I loved reading this book to my young students (18 months through kindergarten) and they paid rapt attention.  They enjoy the colorful and original art.  And they like the sing-song rhyme of the text.<br /><br />While it says the book is for children two to five years of age, I think you can read it as soon as a child is ready for books like 6 months or possibly younger. Young children can begin to learn colors, numbers and letter sounds from birth.  I used to recite the letter sounds with accompanying letter pictures (a for apple) to my sons, and by age age two they knew all of their letter sounds, by three they were reading words and by four they were reading books.  Also did counting and color activities and books with them. They knew the colors by the age of two as I read books like this one to them and played color games with them.<br /><br />Early learning, when done with a non-pressured and joyous, happy approach is wonderful for young children as their minds are so absorbent.  They want to learn, are wired to learn and don't distinguish between learning and play. If they can learn to speak a foreign language in six months at the age of four when it takes an adult years, it is clear their minds are like a sponge at these young ages.  Books that teach while entertain, like this one, are wonderful.  This book is a classic book for young children.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have loved this entire series, and Season 3 holds some of the greatest twists in the story yet! The acting, the cinemetography, everything is superb
1589949811|5.0|I bought this card game for my 20something son.  He worked for a board game company and now works for a video game company.  He only asks for games he has researched and/or played.  He likes this game very much.  I like Tolkien's books and am always happy to buy anything associated with them as they seem to incorporate the same quality.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game great for anyone that loves horses great for kids and adults I personally love this game its the best I give it 5 stars. Great game love it
B00BOA9MVI|4.0|Very good read. A book that shows both sides of the war. I enjoyed it very much and recommend it to any reader of war history.
B007TK77QE|4.0|I hadn't read any other work of Ms Rowling, so It was with an open mind that I downloaded the sample,,, which grabbed me immediately!<br /><br />Beautifully written from the beginning to the necessary ending: Ms Rowling can definitely &#34;do the police in different voices&#34;.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I was afraid that this series was going to be bad. So I prepared to be bored. Not even in five minutes into the first episode, i had found my new favorite show. It has its twists and turns. I always think the person behind the whole thing is one person but it turns out to be another person. Crime Fantasy drama that keeps on making me ask for more
B00F5FBE82|3.0|Not a bad cd but of all drakes music out there this is my least favorite album. Most songs are about him saying hes the best
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|this app provides a simple way to add a clock/alarm to your phone or tablet. It is simple and to the poit, no bells or whistles, but then again you want an app to do exactly wha it tells you it does.
B00DWZHTOU|2.0|Before I begin, go ahead and read a few 5 star reviews on this one, notice the majority of the 5 star reviews are just so happy, jovial, nearly commercial sounding, also notice those reviewers have never reviewed anything else....ever!!!  These are plant reviewers to help the DVD sell.<br /><br />Fast paced plot twisting let down. If you like movies with no explanation of plots or details or if you do believe in magic and everything you see then you'll love this.<br />If you prefer movies with plot building, character building, relating to the characters, substance and an ending that completes the movie, then do not watch this one. I love my 16yr old daughter but the good lord did not grace her with patience or common sense in the real world but she is trying. Having said that, she thought this was the best movie she had seen in her life. Absolutely no explanation on many plot twists, ---SPOILERS HERE...SPOILERS HERE.......The 5th Horseman we find at the end? He funded all that and was a full time police officer?  Who set up the elaborate show at the end? The lights, the props?<br />Are we to believe they hypnotized dozens and dozens of people? I thought they were street magicians not professional stunt drivers to do what they did on that bridge?..come on people.<br />And what actually happened-(the other 4 horseman)to them in the end? So there really is \\"the eye\\" ? This movie requires absolutely no thinking except to wonder why they would try to smooth over and explain so many unrealistic plot elements. The movie cannot figure out how to carry itself except jump from scene to scene with no logical substance. Don't waste your time or money.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Chromecast is exactly what I have been waiting on. I've been using it for about 1 1/2 months now and it works great. All I wanted was something to stream my netflix and capable of streaming other videos. This device has made my life so much easier, not having to fire up the ps3 or 360 every time I want to watch netflix is very nice. I know lots of people are upset because it \\"lacks functionality\\" of other devices...I don't understand this because there is no false advertising by Google on this one. You get exactly what they describe it as. Great device.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|I have friends who recommended this series highly, and after finding the first book in the series (On Basilisk Station) I have to agree. These are the books that one &#34;never stops reading,&#34; sweeping through the whole grand adventure time after time. Mr Weber has a good sense of how to balance good fortune which seems to stick to Lady Harrington like glue with the sacrifices made by armed forces *everywhere* in the struggle to protect those who cannot protect themselves.<br /><br />If the reader likes &#34;military sci-fi&#34; this is an excellent series. Sometimes a little heavy on exposition, but with the increasingly complex political and social situations embraced by the series as a whole, that's to be taken in stride. Enjoy!
0786956291|5.0|This is my first venture into classic D&D so I don't know anything about the editions that came before it. That being said, The character creation in the player handbook was done in a cool way (basically a choose your own adventure story that tells you what to fill in based on your choices) and everything is set up nicely. As a huge newbie to this game I feel the books inside helped me along nicely. I recommend it to anyone who is new to the game and wants to give it a shot.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|I was hooked immediately.  I love the relationship he had with his father.  Never seen anything like that in movies or TV.
B00F91H666|1.0|Awful.  But with Pittster, I suppose that was to be expected. Should not have gotten any stars. Bad. Horrible. Waste of good celluloid.  Have I reached 20 words yet?
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|A beautiful 80s action film throwback.  There is very little set up in this film.  You are thrown immediately into the grimy overpopulated world of MegaCity.  Therein we find Dredd: police, jury, executioner.  His face never breaks scowl.  His persona is that of tightly wound sociopath just on this side of moral goodness.  The dialogue is sparse, both literally and in terms of irritating exposition.  It is also one of the few if only action films that portrays the female protagonists as simply people (equals) and not a mewling female in need, or some lesser than sex secondary to men.  It's pretty damned bad ass.  I loved everything about this film and was disappointed that it didnt do better domestically.<br /><br />Everyone I have told to see this has come back and reported that it was as good or better than my pitch to them.<br /><br />Seriously check this flick out.
074401493X|5.0|great review for a great game.  Very colorful and overall nice looking.  Helps to get all trophies, i am glad i bought it
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great story and I loved how it ended.  I was surprised, I laughed, and at times, I wanted to cry.  A very well balanced story.  I highly recommend this book.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|SOA never fails to meet expectations. If you think season 4 was good. Wait until season 5!!!!! SOA 4 LIFE!!!!
B00846REIS|5.0|Couldn't put this book down between my twelve hour shifts and twelve hours is a long day!  Can't wait to read the next!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Uno is a very fun game. I play this all the time. I reccomend this for all ages because its LITT
B00F2362IE|1.0|I feel like I was ripped off. It kept freezing. My grandson couldn't use it. I deleted it so he couldn't get mad when it wouldn't  work.
B00DHNJCKQ|3.0|No real surprises, acting was slightly above average. Watched on one of my frequent business trips. I fly internationally so the flights tend to be long. Helped past time and I like the actors. Would not be one I would watch over and over again. Once was enough.
B00296A4F4|4.0|Fun to see them before they all got &#34;Hollywood-ized&#34;.  They look more like normal High Schoolers than the glamor versions of later seasons.
B009IU6BIS|5.0|Great Picture Quality Great Family Movie Except same bad language Very Funny. And a Great Movie to Watch During Christmas or Anytime.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is really fun and addicting  at the same time I highly recommend this game to any one. But be careful you'd towns happiness goes up and down even with activities..
B00506NRBS|5.0|Easy to read.  The only book of this sort that actually got me to DO something.  I even re-read it aloud (translated actually) for my wife.  Thank you Sivers.
0861714911|5.0|Some unique qualities of this anthology that make it so wonderful are (1) The consistency of language used in translation (2) Presenting the Buddha's teachings in a structured way that develops from the simple to the complex throughout the book (3) End notes that provide essential commentary (4) The absolutely magnificent introductions to each chapter written by Ven.

B008IJT0CE|4.0|I don't much care for any of the musical options but the rain/water/nature type sounds are very nice to fall asleep listening to. I also really like the option of mixing and matching the sounds together.
B006FH2W4O|4.0|This first book in the series had me hooked in the first chapter, transported to another time & place ,no mean feat,as I am a 75yr old grandmother,prone to seasickness. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|Best reason to read this shocker is how it demolishes the myth of civilian control of the military camouflaged by national security propaganda. Second best for baring the use of WMDs to hold hostage the terrified global populace by military command and control aided and abetted by commanders-in-chief promoted into the darkness of highest secrecy from sunlit civilian status after election (also known as a coup).<br /><br />From the birth of nuclear weapons the military saw its salvation from peaceful disarmament. Nukes quickly were seen as the golden chalice forever requiring protection by palace guards no matter who temporarily held the executive office. Too dangerous for fickle and faint-hearted civilians, the military devised a secret means to pretend civilian control without more than publicity substance. That deception continues despite military stupidity, blumbling, grave errors, infighting services, wastage, environmental contamination, chronic lying to the media and public, budget extortion, incessant propaganda about national security threats, the quintessential elements given birth in 1947 with national security institutionalization as secular religion.<br /><br />Read this dreadful story and weep for your criminally terrified loved ones, then, now and in the future, cry for helplessness against this horrifying disease of WMD threatening the earth.<br /><br />Ever so quietly, for we are being pervasively spied on, especially on Amazon and its ilk, ponder how the weapons and information industries gained control of the United States of America and from that base spread their infection of WMD terror worldwide under guise of democracy.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The show is awesome. Great storylines and good actors. The show keeps you hooked every episode. Looking forward to season 4.
B006QKKMBA|4.0|I liked it it was a good movie for the series  I would recommend it especially you order the 4 pack
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this app is really fun! there are many cute levels to play with all of your minion friends. I love this game: )
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I love this game- the colors are great and the 3-D effect makes it more interesting than majong! There's never any trouble opening it up to play like some other games I have, but be careful...it's addictive!
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Entire cast is great. Fun film to watch. Bruce Willis and Mary-Louise Parker have a great chemistry on the screen.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|it is addicting but its slow!!! it is verry slow / fun / and funny at the same time. pretty good game you should still buy it.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|Item received plays great. Great movie, lots of history. Will shop from this store again. I come from the same hometown as Sgt. York.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|I like playing the game but after one month, I am already getting repeat clues.  Also, it tells me I am playing on more than one device but I only have it on my Kindle.  In addition when my friend upgraded her version on her IPad, our game locked up. We had to delete the game ( losing all history) and start again.  Amazon Kindle needs to keep up the the iPad/IPhone upgrades.
B00DH1G7DS|2.0|Okay but took to long to load and wasn't what I thought it would be like.  Okay if you just like to play once in awhile.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|I Didn't have High Expectations For this Movie But i Did Like It Quite A Bit. Its Like A 2 Hour Long Episode Of \\"The Walking Dead\\".
B00594XOZU|2.0|I try to log in and it says it's taking to long to log in and it fails when I try to log in
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|This book sounded interesting and i thought it was going to be a Mystery type book.  It ended up being a quick enjoyable read that was more Fantasy.  It was alittle confusing in parts to me, but i still enjoyed it. The story reminded me of a  Mother Goose /Fable.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|A sweet story about understanding and trust, in exquisite PIXAR graphics....Sully, Mike, and Boo are endearing characters, our 7 year old LOVES it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Honestly this game is amazing! It's addicting and gets your mind off your daily stress,I would recommend minion rush to whoever loves minions! (The purple minions are my favorites)
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This story is tied together so well.  I think he could lecture on writing to willing students.  I could follow his outline
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|I could play this again but not to often but not like the other games I play but interesting to play
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I've been using Chromecast for a couple of weeks now with mixed results. For example, \\"casting\\" a web page containing video of our pastor's sermon from a week ago resulted in stuttering video and audio and dropped \\"casts\\" so many times today that we gave up and just watched it on the laptop.<br /><br />On the other hand, using the Chromecast button to watch TV episodes via Netflix and miscellaneous videos via YouTube has been quite successful. So we're still making up our minds whether this gadget will have a permanent place in our TV watching.<br /><br />We also will need to have our Harmony remote reprogrammed so we can quickly navigate to HDMI 2. Right now that involves switching to the \\"laptop/PC\\" preprogrammed setting on the Harmony, then finding the separate TV remote in order to select HDMI 2. So for us, being technologically un-savvy when it comes to Harmony programming, that will be an extra expense, since it's annoying to keep that separate TV remote around.<br /><br />It's kind of annoying to have a separate power cord hanging down the front of our entertainment center. There's no way to move the entertainment center away from the wall to slip the cord behind (the thing weighs several hundred pounds). I know, small potatoes when it comes to complaints! Overall, for $35, it seems like a good value for the money, as long as we keep the Netflix membership.<br /><br />Speaking of Netflix membership, I was under the impression when I ordered the Chromecast that it came with 3 months of free Netflix membership. I was supposed to get a confirmation email along with the \\"your order has shipped!\\" email. It never came. So I called Amazon.com today and, after 35 minutes on the phone with a customer service rep, was informed that I had missed the deadline for that promotion by four days. Yet it was still being advertised in various places long after. Irritating, but my own fault for not reading the fine print. Buyer beware!<br /><br />UPDATE: I brought my Chromecastto a Hilton hotel in Denver, CO, and plugged it into the back of the LG TV in HDMI 1. I then spent half an hour on the phone with the hotel chain's Internet tech support, trying to get the Chromecast and my laptop to recognize each other. But because you have to jump through some hoops when you log on to the hotel's wi-fi, and those hoops can't be jumped through by the Chromecast, there was no way to get the Chromecast and the laptop to be on the same wavelength, so to speak. We got them both online, but one couldn't see the other because tech support had to manually get the Chromecast online using its MAC ID (which has nothing to do with being on either a MAC or a PC, I found out). So don't expect to use your Chromecast in hotel TVs, unless you're using a wi-fi network that demands absolutely nothing in the way of a browser login.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Martin is a matter of surprise. I love how he catches me off guard. I still have not learned how to predict him and that delights me.
B00F3LDAQM|5.0|Great classic I first read this in high school and have never tired of reading it these 20  years or so later.
B00APUTEBG|4.0|Fairly well-acted, non-predictable story line in a beautiful setting.  Won;t win any awards but it was entertaining enough on a dismal TV Saturday night.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|As a Star Trek fan, I enjoyed the funny take on the story of this Space ship. It poked fun at all the (now silly) action scenes from the original series.<br />I like the book as a light read. Don't expect a literary marvel, just a fun story.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|...right up until I purchased tokens, which was also supposed to make it ad-free, and lost all my tokens, coins and my level 50-which I earned. Yeah, I'm a little peaved!
B001KOFH2G|4.0|A really good closure to the Firefly universe. This movie has it all, great script, amazing action scenes and pretty cool special effects. Whish they have more time to develop some of the characters, nevertheless this is a great Sci-Fi movie and the Blue Ray makes this movie looks even more spectacular. Plus the audio quality is top notch.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|This Doctor is alright but I liked David Tennant better.Amy Pond is the 1 who has my attention in this Season ;+)
B001EN71CW|5.0|My favorite Sci-fi TV show, it's the perfect blend of a great script with an amazing array of actors and actresses performing at their best. The Blue Ray edition is near perfect, all the chapters plus the original pilot and a bunch of extras makes this a great purchase. A space cowboy show that will leave you asking for more.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very enjoyable ,, kept you guessing . The character s were a good mix. Would recommend reading it..hope to read more from this author
B004U8VX2M|5.0|A great series that I go back to over and over again. Excellent acting; interesting characters and storylines; accurately depicts life as it was between the classes.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Better story and written better than some prior novels.  Content more of a mystery.  Story kept me more interested to read.
B001VU1NJ0|5.0|A riveting storyline that held me to the end. Great acting. A week later I'm still thinking about it. Haunting.
0385535147|5.0|If you like Grisham you would love this book and if you had never read one of hi books don think too much and buy it, I finished reading it and stated to think when i will read his next novel
B004R1Q296|4.0|Many books on this topic deal only with the lifestyle and conflicts among those in the ruling class; this one does not;  instead, it gives a much more comprehensive view by discussing how the disastrous chaotic policies of those decaying medieval fiefdoms combined with the plague impacted their economies and those below them, all of which eventually led to their demise.<br /><br />While the title implies that our society is a reflection of those times, we have, in comparison, moved forward albeit with a way to go yet in abandoning war as an economic tool and means of conflict resolution...
B000RO9VJK|5.0|One of the best books I read.<br />Talks about the importance of process.<br />Talks about the 3 roles: tecnichal, manager and enterprenour.<br />Talks about the vision and organization needed.<br />A nice surprise!
B00BFV1LZG|4.0|&#34;The Maze Runner&#34; is an interesting read and avoids the obvious sexist pitfalls of the majority of your characters being male. I would be impressed, but frankly it's nothing we shouldn't automatically expect from authors. James Dashner also manages to avoid having the book feel too claustrophobic, which would have been easy considering the environment. All in all, a good read and I'm looking forward to the sequels.
B004GYY714|5.0|Easy to use, can find almost any station.  With WiFi streaming is clear with good sound, better than the analogue radio
B0010SKSTO|5.0|This is an important read for anyone. The author is an impressively skilled and experienced writer and expert.<br />Fred Hausheer, MD, PhD, FACP
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Following what was an excellent season 1, which I am sure was a pleasant surprise for many, I was hooked and the series has become one of Public Television's biggest hits ever.  It has so many stars and each fits his or her role perfectly.  The story line is captivating and there are no dull moments as scene move quickly from place and character to others rapidly.  The music is such a great part of the supporting cast.  The series has performances that are at the top of the list and it is represented yearly at the Emmy's.  Millions around the world have been seduced by the straight-laced but stylish world of the British historical drama.  The main characters Hugh Bonneville, Maggie Smith, Michelle Dockery, and Elizabeth Montgomery could win Best in their categories each year.  I found the story line to be such as to force me to watch one episode after another and before I knew it I had watched the first three seasons completely.  It was as if I had been drawn into the surrounding, but in my case I was privy to everyone's secrets and behaviors.  I can hardly wait for Season 4 to arrive in January 2014.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|I got this movie and enjoyed it very much.  I have told my family and friends to watch this movie.

B000RH0C8G|3.0|Although I learned a lot about the approach to finding major league baseball players, I find Michael Lewis's style of writing tiresome. It was still worth reading
B005WTR4ZI|3.0|Reality, how did we get where we are? Only one side of a vary complex ongoing change. Does not really address the question of this perhaps being the change that does drastically reduce the number of productive hours the world needs.
B00992CF6W|5.0|when my friends who play mcpc and mcxbox saw mcpe they didn't like it but I cant stop playing it though it needs a ton of stuff its still pretty fun
B002N14GPE|4.0|I'd heard good things about this one, and went in with high hopes.  Surprisingly it lived up to them.  The twists are a bit predictable, but the execution of this film is spot on, and it's thoroughly worth a rental.
B00CL6GAD2|3.0|Wahlberg just can't seem to find a script that will put him in any award categories. Luckily, his onscreen performance with supporting actor Denzel Washington in 2 Guns will bolster his career. I would wait till this comes available on Netflix rather than paying the $6 to rent from Amazon. Unless you suffer from insomnia and need help getting to sleep. This will sure help get anyone to nod asleep.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I am not a fan of reading books mostly due to not being able to see what was taking place via my imagination. When i heard about this book, i was curious so i thought i would give it a shot. I was unable to put it down. Everything was done well, from the individual personalities, to the training and games, to his attempt to fight his inner struggles.  AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING!
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|This movie is finally something somewhat original with a good story twist to it. I was on the edge of my seat for this story trying to figure out who was the guy behind the scenes. The movie sells it well as to keep you guessing.
B004132I20|3.0|The AC Roma shirt is BEAUTIFUL and they ARE my favorite team.. but I really require a larger XX fit.<br />Still great though; Go Wolves!
B00F35B8F8|4.0|I am not a fan of reboots, but JJ Abrams is doing the Star Trek series justice. I believe the first one is better than this installment, as there are a couple of noticeable plot holes. The special effects and the onscreen chemistry between Spock and Kirk make up for all negatives.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I really don't want to write a review but for some reason it's making me. I really don't like the way it's set up
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I wish this was required reading for all middle schoolers!  A must read for anyone. Very poignant and hope filled
B0011NVC9I|5.0|This wonderful movie brings to life  the awesome epic poem &#34;Beowulf&#34;. The visual effects and the production are superb. The only thing that I didn't like about it was the over interpretations that the script makers or the director made. I have always thought that a work of art must speak by itself. I consider the film to be an excellent complement to a literature class.
B000FC12Z0|5.0|Classic Agatha Christie! She really brings life to Poirot and all the characters on the train. You will not be disappointed and it will definitely keep your attention. I've read many of her books but this one is my favorite.
B001O6W9QC|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. was amazing in this...there are some very silly bits, but hey its a comedy! The acting was great! I enjoyed it. I watched this the night before a big exam and it helped to keep my mind off the test and stressing over it, so the movie was a great distraction.
B00DJ80VLS|3.0|This album is a good one but not their best.. The music is pretty good but there are 2 issues><br />1) The album is over produced - the drums sound like a drum machine and the overall sound is too compressed... I would like for DT to do what Opeth did with Heritage sound wise meaning to record and album that does not sound like coming out of a synth...<br />2) I believe James LaBrie is becoming the weak link in DT... He is so freaking boring to listen to and he makes songs dull... He is too romantic and melodic...<br /><br />The 2000's were not DT's best years and even thou the 2010's are getting a little better there is no comparison to the 90's... I believe this happens to most bands but I rather have a so so DT than no DT at all<br />Lets not be so harsh on them
B00957T6X6|5.0|I did not even know there is a TV Series! I had been reading books throughout the summer when my husband said I should read the first book in this series. I was hooked right away of course and quickly read the whole boxed set only to find out that the next book doesn't come out until 2015!<br /><br />It ran long in some parts with no real action or resolution where the author could have put some. It reminded me of the daytime soap opera's where you feel like you are on the edge of a break through where something big is going to happen, but then nothing happens. I would still read again and again though and will continue to eagerly anticipate the next booking n the series! Hurry, hurry, hurry!
B0078XGEK2|5.0|This book is amazing, helps identify yourself and those around you. If read at the right phase of your life, it may help you change it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great  storyline always!  Macht does an outstanding job as always.  The ratings for this show should be better, but then, I wouldn't consider it a hidden gem.
B006X08FDA|3.0|This cd was somewhat disappointing in that it is boring. It does not have piz az that the Fantastics has nor the soothing nature of the Paul Anka  cd.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I have always selected Sean Connery as my favorite Bond, but Daniel Craig is slowly changing my mind.  If you like action packed James Bond, watch this movie.  The entire movie is fantastic, but the cost is worth it, just for the opening scene.
B00FG5E03W|5.0|Superb film. Well written. Huge props to the editors. Beautifully filmed. Music was quite fitting as well.<br /><br />I had to watch it twice. The first time I only focused on the characters. The second time I had to focus on the plot.<br /><br />Lead actors, Diane, Jared, Juno, Toby, (Sarah, and Rhys) were a genuine pleasure to watch.<br /><br />Diane was a convincing brunette with that touch of sadness that I never really saw in her other films.<br /><br />I enjoyed seeing Jared as the lead in this film. I feel he raised the bar for himself as an actor.<br /><br />Juno was mesmerizing to watch and listen to. She needs to be cast as the lead in more films.<br /><br />Toby was catching to watch from the start. His touch on each of his character's lives always had me wanting more for him.<br /><br />Sarah and Rhys were excellent. I include them in this review only because I found myself the most lost in their characters.(Perhaps because their characters were more supporting rather than leading.)<br /><br />I found the soul of this (love?) story to be of what I don't ask (and answer) myself of enough; Do we truly exist? We do and we don't.  It's all up to a choice? Time. Big Bang. Expansion of the Universe.  It's all because of a cheap pair of jeans, the steam from an egg, and poor short term memory. Right? No, no. It's all about a third choice. Shabby haired and shabby clothed Jared and Diane triumph.  Maybe there should have been a fourth and fifth choice as well...<br /><br />I only have one (long, wordy) question. At the end of the film, (Light house, chalk circle, park bench, hobo Jared and Diane): How do these two have this happy ending?  The only way they could have finally found each other was because 9 year old Nemo made that plot-twisting third choice.  Choice number 3 should take them both down separate paths where they do not live together as teenagers and fall in love. So they shouldn't need to find each other in the end? Yes? Maybe I missed something. Feel free to help me out on this one.<br /><br />This is my first review of any film publicly. I am not a professional film critic. I thoroughly enjoyed this film enough to question it is all. Agree or disagree, all I wanted was to get my thoughts out there. Thank you for reading. :o)
B004SUWR2C|5.0|This game is super addicting! Well worth the purchase (only $1) and it is a world better than the free version. Definitely recommend
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book kept me tuned in. The characters were interesting and the story was engrossing, difficult to read sometimes because of the painfulness of its reality, but fascinating nonetheless.
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|THIS GAME IS AWESOME! I like to play hidden object games! My daughter and I play it together. She also likes to play by herself.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I enjoyed reading the book through two voices. I could feel the oppression of women through Grissom's words - both slave and white.  Great use of language.

B003U53GK8|4.0|It's wonderful series , reminding people about how life and death and hell fell like. You find yourself somewhere in another world thinking you can make it back to where you use to be. And have your old life style. Wish is impossible .<br />You find yourself in inecable situation only god can make a differences now . I like the serie , but jack shouldn't take the rule of Jacob . He should have brought some changes to the hole situations .
B00DYOOGYK|1.0|The game is really bad for 7 $ is a rip off i bought the game like 3 weeks ago but I coudn't try it out since I was out of the country, I would like to get my money back
014241543X|5.0|Plot: I had never read a book with a plot that takes place in one day (the book also has flashbacks) and one with such a simple premise. While reading the book I kept asking myself what I'd do if I was in Mia's shoes and I had no idea what I'd do, it is a near impossible choice. I love seeing her life through the flashbacks and seeing this family in them made this story one of the hardest books I have ever read.<br /><br />Characters: Mia was a great character, but it was a little challenging to really get to know her just because we only saw who she was through flashbacks, but they helped us see who she was. Adam was one of my favorite characters in the book and really loved seeing how he and Mia first met. The rest of the family were really great and not your typical family which made them really unique and the story that much sadder.<br /><br />Overall: This was a very simple and short story (my edition is only 196 pages), but it was a emotional roller coaster of book. It amazed me that in such a short amount of time Gayle made me fall in love with every single character and that made the book that much more heartbreaking, but it also had a touch of hope. Gayle has become one of my favorite authors and it all began with this book, if you love contemporary books with characters you'd swear are real and a story that makes you think you should not hesitate to pick up this book. 5/5 Stars
B009ME47H2|4.0|This app is very useful and simple to use. I use it for studying and for recording things I want to remember like my dreams.
B0083Z3O8Y|1.0|Tedious, irrelevant and boring. Not worth the effort. The book club said same thing. Not recommended to the sane. Tell your friends
B001IWV030|5.0|i remeber having the novelization of this when i was young. the film was funny but somehow seemed tiresome at times though it does have a great cast. still this ones hard to find so i didnt mind getting it because its good.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|There are increasing numbers of options when it comes to casting computer content to your TV, and many of them are good, but most of them are good in different ways and/or for different reasons.  Chromecast is one of those products that is great due to ease of use and price, particularly for those who benefitted from the 3 months of netflix.  But even without the free netflix, it's an inexpensive way to get content from your computer to your TV.  No, it's not terribly well supported at this point, but it has a LOT of room for growth (and support is claimed to be coming from many content providers), and at this price, there is really no barrier to entry.  It's simple to setup, and quality is great when using supported media streams.  Quality isn't so great in some of the current hacky/beta solutions like screen casting from chrome, but improvements are coming.<br /><br />Right now, it's a Netflix caster and kind of a toy, but it's a cheap one, and one which has some very incredible potential as it develops.  Being able to cast web views alone will be worth it once they get the quality/consistency up a bit with software patches.<br /><br />I use other streamers for most of my local content right now (Roku, PS4, XBMC and/or Plex depending on the mood/room/content/etc), but I can see Chrome covering much of the ground that these others cover once the API opens up.  It's a pretty easy buy &#34;recommend&#34; for anyone interested in technology.
B00F8H0LM2|3.0|I bought this game in hopes of getting int play again after finishing the 1st edition. I was disappointed  in that it appeared to either get stuck on reward chapter or that is all I got. That is why I gave it 3 stars because I expected longer play.
B0063IH60K|2.0|not a bad game to play just has to many ads and to many popups. gets aggrevating trying to play and stupid ads popup which there is nothing thst catches my eye to want to nuy. on a scale of 1_10 i would rate it a 3 maybe more like a 2.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|In the real world, people are born, fall in love, marry, and die according to their stars and not by the exigencies of the actors. The beauty of Downton Abbey is you feel the randomness of life within their best laid plans. Being a breast cancer survivor, I appreciated the glimpse into how that situation may have played out in the early years of the 20th century. Having a gay sister and a brother, also gay, who died of AIDs, I very much appreciated how far we have come. And, being a hopeless romantic, I appreciate the restrained beauty of the many interactions, both platonic and amorous. But most of all, I love watching Maggie Smith chew up the scenery, whether riding in the back of the limo or walking across the room after the death of her granddaughter. What a gal!
B00E8B1358|4.0|Fun to watch, leaves me wanting more gratuitous violence.  Pretty good fx, needs nudity, and flying body parts, and Arnold.
B001F6ZIXW|4.0|Entertaining and reasonably intelligent. Well-acted. I'm just on season one, so I don't know how well it will hold up.
B0064MGU98|5.0|The cases are excellent. Sorry I'm get tired of typing. I don't think I'll rate anything else anytime soon. Too many words are required. It says I've used enough but I want to make sure. Two plus two equals four and it should. There are a lot of things that add up and they should. I'm done. I like this program. The Good Wife. You may not. But I do. I hope my review helps.
B0045XGRQE|4.0|I watched it the first time and thought it was garbage. I am a retired math/science teacher and there was MUCH that was too fanciful, but was palmed off on the public as possible.<br />the third time I watched it, I tried to view it as a drama. That made it much easier.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|The story is engaging and the characters are well written. It was difficult to put down.  BUT ...<br />This \\"book\\", and at least the next 2 (I haven't read beyond that yet), are NOT complete books. They do not even wrap up the sub-plots at the end, instead they are left in cliff-hangers.<br /><br />The story is good enough that you want to come back for the next book to see the outcome.  So unless you are willing to buy the entire series to finish the story (and I am not sure if the existing books DO finish the story), Do not start reading this one.<br /><br />I would ordinarily have given this a five star review, but it has lost a star because of the endings. As far as I am concerned it is the worst thing a writer can do and is cheating the readers. I understand that with any series, the primary plot continues throughout the series, but good writers will generally wrap up sub-plots rather than leaving readers hanging, thus giving the reader the option of whether to get the next book or not based on the quality of the writing, not just to find out what happened.  I feel as if it is just a ploy to sell more books.
B00F91SCXC|1.0|This was just a total waste of my time. I could never realize that a plot was present, and it began with Daddy Brad cooking breakfast for his family. I really thought that I was watching a reality show. UGH!
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|Stieg Larsson put an incredible amount of thought into this trilogy. They are so well written. Very much the page turner. Well worth the read.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|over the years King has written a large selection of outstanding work and some  hack work. This is somewhere in between. No one has  characters that are as real and dialoge that flows. This book satisfys on many levels, but sometimes the story gets in front of itself. I enjoyed it but I wouldn't read it again unlike others that I have re-read several times. Also, not his fault, Amazon charged me 11.00 for this download and then saw it today for 8.00 It's not the money, it's the point.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Excellent!!!! Love the thrilling eerie suspense....secrets, deception lives you on edge and while you tell ypurself you can't hold no longer...BAM in your face what you thought to be true is soo totally  false
B002M5E2DW|5.0|This way of living brings Jesu's words into perspective. This style of living where you change your thinking has opened a whole new world to me. I am in charge of my life and will live it happy, healthy, and peacefully because I am a perfect child of God thanks to this book and my new church who teaches this way to live
B00499NHLC|5.0|I've been a huge Sherlock Holmes fan ever since I read the books in middle school, always devouring any Holmes material I can get my hands on. This TV show is definitely an AMAZING and FANTASTIC portrayal of Sherlock and Watson and their many adventures. Will be obsessed with this for quite a while I think.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|fun without having to purchase any extras. just challenging enough to keep you hooked yet easy enough not to frustrate you into quitting
B0040I09RM|4.0|If you like this type of show, you will really like this one. I recommend it. One of the good ones.
B0040Z9H5K|5.0|I couldn't find the DVD anywhere so I decided to stream it thru Amazon.  I'm brilliant.  Great movie, terrific quality and easy to find in my Amazon Library.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|When I started reading, despite all the praise I had read about A Raven's Shadow I thought it would be A Game of Throne's Shadow with a twist in the narrative structure. Right now I am just empty because I finished the book yesterday and according to the writer/publisher we have to wait till spring 2014 for the next part. Too bad.<br />Although I find the main character's description somewhat shallow (or maybe my imagination is shallow a bit because sometimes his actions and the circumstances were not enough for me to understand clearly his motives), the nonlinear 'book in the book' ('memoir in the memoir') structure makes up for it.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|I purchased this movie as a gift for someone, and the recipient loved it. It scored me a \\"home run\\", if you catch my drift.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|This movie came in a reasonable time.  It worked well and I enjoyed it on my 55 inch 3D TV.  Wonderful movie.
B000VXJYFI|5.0|It seems like when this came out a lot of people dismissed it as a contractual obligation album & below the standards of his previous albums. For me it was the next Hendrix album of new songs. I didn't really think of it as a live album, just great music. This was the last time we got to hear an album assembled by Jimi in his short life & as far as I'm concerned it's another masterpiece. At a time when a live album meant live recordings of your hits, it took balls to release one of all new material. After this all we got were bastardized version of further material with the songs of hjs next partly finished album split between three albums, eventually rectified in the best way possible with the release of First Rays O The New Rising Sun. Gypsys though is probably the Hendrix album I listen to most frequently & is most highly recommended. Unless you can find it cheap I don't really recommend the BOG2.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|A must read for anyone who has ever asked &#34;is this it?&#34;  Great insights on the new economy and how to survive (and thrive) in it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The beginning was a tad slow but then it picked up and I loved the rest. It was fantastic. Well done.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Great plot! Good character development and beautiful scenery!  Will recommend it to my friends! Looking forward to the next season.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|The subject of foster care children, and homeless adults are not easy to read about, though it is a subject we all probably need to know more about. This story blends those subjects with the nearly lost art of &#34;the language of flowers&#34;.
B00BEIYM42|5.0|Should be required viewing of everyone ; great compassion and love is displayed in this movie; go for this movie!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Very straight forward app, easy to operate. I had no problems at all. I would definitely recommend it to my friends.
0446699616|2.0|I am DeMille and John Corey fan. However, this book just droned on with incessant conversation and absolutely no action until the very, very, very end. Anything but a page-turner, no twists-and-turns, no surprises, no literary tension. I even got sick of John Corey's incessant smart-aleck remarks after a while, because there was no action to go with them. All the characters did for virtually the entire book was meet with some Yemenese locals and FBI and CIA contacts and travel around, conversing endlessly about the bad guy and what they were going to do with him when they caught up with him, which seemed like an eternity. I kept wondering, when the heck is something--anything--gong to happen? This book made me cautious about reading future DeMille books. DeMille is a master of conversation but in this book, a complete failure when it came to STORY!
B007IXWKUK|1.0|This book does not load on your device it requires an internet connection to be read. Worthless. Wish I had my $10 back.

B00ELD3MUW|1.0|.....good for some things but not all. It did not serve my purposes. I need flash to play certain games and this download did not work.
B005BZQVJ8|4.0|If you like Simon Pegg’s movies in general, you'll love Paul. It’s funny and surprising. Unfortunately the plot is pretty straightforward so there isn’t a lot of replay value.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|Actually, I didn't know it was about Zombies at first.  But really, the movie's premise was lame and even Lamer, were the &#34;zombies&#34; themselves that moved at the speed o' light as opposed to the .01 mph they usually do.  So, the movie was both way over the top -  and way down in the trough at the same time.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|this game refuses to download onto my kindle. Money wasted. I love this game but why? Why won't it freaking download?!?
B00DK9FNLY|5.0|The vast majority of reviews I've read are poison pen as far as I am concerned!  The permissions are just fine.  No mention of ads, of which I have yet to encounterif if they are really there.  I had absolutely no problem serving or using spin on the ball.  I'm not that great in using my big fingers on the paddle, but I am using a Motorola Droid Razr and I assume that it would be a bit better if I were using a tablet.  Solid game, I say!  Get it!
B009LRE040|5.0|This is a phenomenal end to the series. It is well cast, directed, scripted - everything - truly a great film. It is one of my absolute favorites!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|The device does not support 5ghz channels. Jesus.<br /><br />The device sometimes allows you to connect, other times it does not. It is simply unstable.<br /><br />It only provides 720p video so you should be aware that it is not an alternative to devices such as the WDTV live, rather it is useful for showing your laptop or tablet's screen on the TV, and to stream music, etc.<br /><br />I bought it to stream music through Google Play as I knew it was deficient as a video player prior to purchase. Trying to use it for just that purpose, I unfortunately have to make about 10 connection attempts each time before it is able to work. And then it will occasionally disconnect, forcing me to repeat the process.<br /><br />It seems to have a horrible wireless card, which is a shame because the device is otherwise pure genius. It is very useful when it is working.
B008MBXFEM|5.0|I love this soundtrack - it is a perfect complement to this movie. this really is a great score and I highly recommend it.
0671042858|5.0|This is one of those rare books that I read every single year.  I constantly think about it, and am still amazed at what an incredible read it is.  There is nothing horrifying that is going to give you nightmares, but it is the constant fear that something horrible is about to happen.  I think this is one of the greatest books ever written.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|Watched the series for the first time andenjoyed it. Love the characters snd the storylines. I don't know how I missed this show.

B00BK5D95C|5.0|This is the first album I have bought of this band and had only heard one song before purchasing.  the whole album is really good.  The band has a unique sound and the lead singer has a distinctive voice.

B00FEHXCIG|2.0|Worst movie of the franchise. Butchered the mandarin. I expected more after such a great avengers performance. This was complete fodder for Agents of Shield.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|This was a great movie!  My daughter said there weren't the usual predictable cheesy parts.  My sons loved it also!
B00DKY4LBW|5.0|Believe the hype. AM is a heady mix of swaggering beats, slinky riffs, and sophisticated out-on-the-tiles lyrics. Flashing hints of 1990's Dr. Dre, Paranoid-era Black Sabbath, and early 1980s Hall & Oates, AM is an amalgam of musical awesomeness. Most of the tunes have a not-too-sweet pop catchiness to them, without sacrificing any of the indie-cred creativity and cleverness that the Arctic Monkeys are rightfully known for. This is a much more varied and listenable album than the last two Josh Homme-produced efforts (both of which underwhelmed me). I've been listening to AM on repeat for the last week, to the exclusion of everything else, and it's still not old (I must have listened to R U Mine at least a hundred times, while trying to learn the drum parts; it still rocks harder than anything they've done since their debut). I can't remember the last time that I've been this into an album. Every night a different AM song is stuck in my head and when I wake in the morning another has taken its place. It's quite simply my favorite album of 2013 (so far).
B00004TH6O|5.0|Queens of the Stone Age are a phenomenal band. Always catchy, yet dark enough to keep you thinking. This makes me want to go find my Kyuss.

B00B22ASUM|5.0|Yes I love animals, especially cats. However, this is a wonderful story showing life's struggle  to survive against hardship and frailty, common to all forms of life. It is a testament to the strength of a human being over his personal demons. It is an example of the importance of soulful relationships in our lives. It is a story of salvation, well written with humility.

B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Steven Soderbergh last film - according to him is a fun affair. Its serious but at the same time there is entertainment which makes fun of psychology, big pharma and money.<br />A former wall street hotshot Channing Tatum is married to a nervous wreck Emily (Rooney Mara) who is crazy enough to drive her car into the wall and thus landing  with Jonathan ( Jude Law) as her psychiatrist who puts her on a new drug Ablixia, which makes her even more crazier. But this is a movie and there is a lot of bad marriages and deceptions.This is where the movie starts to take shape and throws a light on the entire nexus of medical, legal and moral structures.<br />I felt that the characters were ok but failed to understand that a doctor who has a such a flourishing practice would be suffering financially when he is forced to suspend practice due to an ongoing investigation. four stars 9/10/2013
B0026NWBY2|5.0|Great musician What else can I say? This is a great purchase a one of a kind cd from a unique  singer-songwriter and amazing guitarist, this is more than awesome.
B00ARA4SLU|4.0|is a very watchable film about Hitchcock s attempt to make the film Psycho. Anthony Hopkins, literally transforms himself and Helen Mirren gives the movie the depth as Alma Reville,the neglected but supportive partner of the often jealous Hitchcock. Alma was not just his wife but his creative partner as she gave creative inputs that the classic shower scene with Janet Leigh be scored with piercing violins by Bernard Herrmann.<br />Hitchcock was a famous director but decides to gamble his reputation and talent by placing his bets on a movie that no one wanted to finance, so he ended financing it himself.<br />We get some details that went into its making but I wish there were many more, the voyeurism of Hitchcock and his eventual acceptance of his wifes creative talent were good scenes. I felt that it would have been great had there been more details about the man or the making of the movie. Three stars. 9/12/2013
B00003CXBH|5.0|Great movie What else can I say? This is a great purchase a one of a kind dvd from a unique cast of actors, this is more than awesome.
B00AIBZLVY|3.0|Guillermo del Toro who brought us the creepy but fascinating  Pans Labyrinth and the exciting Hellboy series brings us Mama as an executive producer. The scares are genuine and the movie is exciting to watch but a weak ending makes it simply an average fare.  I loved the use of the classic horror story elements cabin in the woods, ghosts, sudden noises.<br />The film opens up with the kidnap of two girls by their father who after speeding away from the city loses control of his car in the woods. Five years pass and the uncle Lucas( Nikloj Coster - Waldau) almost gives up looking for these kids,  Victoria (Megan Charpentier) and her younger sibling Lily (Isabelle N&eacute;lisse), when they are discovered. They have turned almost feral and a disturbing force that they call Mama follow them everywhere they go. Both Lucas and his girlfriend are tormented by this figure. Writer and Director Muschietti combines scary elements from other films to serve us a decent product. four stars. 9/10/2013

B009XTF8KQ|3.0|Worn out horror movie cliches are used adequately in this tale of possession which will make you very suspicious of old boxes from yard sales.<br />Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Kyra Sedgwick are parents of a girl (Natasha Calis)  who has been inhabited by an evil spirit released from an old box.<br />Natasha Calis as the young kid tormented by the evil spirit is superb but the cliches are too familiar to be scary.<br />Jeffrey Dean Morgan, looks like a cross between Richard Lewis and Robert Downey is the dad who  looks the most normal and fits in to his role. Kyra Sedwick looks out of place and weird.<br />This is an ordinary horror film which is watchable but not very scary. 9/22/2013

B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|The Impossible is based on the true story of the Alvarez Belon family caught in the 2004 tsunami that ravaged Asia. Anyone watching the film an always guess the ending but this film is not about the destination, it is about the road that the family must have to travel to survive the ordeal and regroup.<br />Henry ( Mcgreogor) and Maria( naomi Watts) are vacationing in Thailand. This is a family who is at play but has worries just like everyone about layoffs at work and back to work transition for the wife, she is a doctor. This is a normal family who are about to suffer under extraordinary circumstances...The Tsunami sequence is just amazing, the devastation by the force of the water is incredible, the sight of bodies being tossed around and getting hit by objects - just watch it to experience it.<br />After the amazing Tsunami sequence the pace does slow down a little bit but the human element comes to the forefront as the family having separated must find each other in the chaos that ensued. Mcgregor and Watts are super actors but it is their screen son Lucas who is the star as he metamorphoses from a boy to a man. He gives an outstanding performance. This is a decent movie that does seem to e a bit stretched when towards the end, the director delves in to melodrama a la bollywood when characters are literally one step away from each other but dont notce. This is a small mistake though for a extremely well made and moving film, four stars. 9/10/2013

It's a positive book with solution to women in corporate America.  So far best women biography I read so far.<br /><br />Only part I didn't like was around end book becomes quiet a bit feminist

B008BQ8VOC|1.0|Suits season 1 was interesting and fun and intelligent.  I was so happy to find a show I really enjoyed.  Then came season two.  It is a Soap Opera.  I don't know why they changed the show so much if it was doing so well, but season it two is just lame - and the addition of more cursing and more sex only made it worse.  Lame, lame, lame.

I didn't do the class, but deep breaths and the breathing the baby out thing really spoke to me and made me feel so much more peaceful during my second birth.  No, it's not the answer to all, your state of mind is more important, and if this book can help that, isn't that success?

B000I9YLUI|5.0|I enjoy Jane Austen's work.  I've read the book.  I've seen the original movie starring Greer Garson, two made for tv movies and this one, the latest.  What I find fascinating is the interpretation, costumes, landscape and how the actors portray their characters.  None are alike.
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|It was a heartwarming story with a lot of laughs. The plot was just as expected  - simple and no twists.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the first Star Trek starring Chris Pine.  His character of a young Capt James T. Kirk was spot on as well as Zachary Quinto's portrayal of young Mr. Spock.  Usually sequels aren't all that good.  However, there are exceptions and this one was.  It's was exciting, thrilling, suspenseful, dramatic and some comedy wrapped into one movie.  I would recommend seeing the first Star Trek with Chris Pine first and definitely get this sequel.

B009949RKC|4.0|I liked this movie. I loved the book and because the characters in the book are so fleshed out and multi dimensional it's difficult for any film maker to capture them completely. This movie did a very good job of that. It gives a good view of the restrictive way in which Carrie was raised and the taboo which her mother burdens her with concerning her unusual gift.
B00D9DCS5K|5.0|it really feels like the show has continued, Yang captures everything about it so well! It's like he was an original writer.
B00C7L4QB4|1.0|I have no qualms with the show as a longtime fan of all things Hannibal Lecter. However, the Amazon TV app for iPad is the single buggiest worthless piece of s*** I have ever used... And since I work with computers for a living, that's saying something! I will be asking for a refund on the entire season as it's basically unwatchable to me in the format I purchased it.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|All the actors are people I enjoy watching, almost independently of the movie they're in.<br /><br />Over-the-top space opera action that looked great. Okay, nearly all the action was within the atmosphere but I think &#34;space opera&#34; is still a good description. This is engineering nerd adolescent (I'm 67) entertainment at its best.  Great story line. Gods, demi-gods, geniuses, and Scarlett.  I read everything in sci-fi and I can see elements of many of the best stories melded into this movie.<br /><br /> Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Raffalo, Paltro, &#34;How I Met Your Mother&#34; Smulders, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, and all the rest

B00DJAUP08|5.0|It's been an interesting decade for the legendary band Earth, Wind & Fire. In 2003, their independently released album \\"The Promise\\" was well received, but barely promoted. However, the single from that album- the Tim & Bob written and produced \\"Hold Me\\"- was nominated for a Grammy for Best Traditional R&B Vocal Performance. In 2005, they released their comeback album \\"Illumination\\". While the album was a return to form for the band, it seemed to garner more attention for the artists and producers attached to the project. The album yielded two singles- the Raphael Saadiq featured and produced \\"Show Me The Way\\" and the Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis produced \\"Pure Gold\\". A couple of years after the release of \\"Illumination\\", their label Sanctuary Records was folded, which left them without a label home. They spent the next several years touring and performing before going into the recording studio. In 2012, they planned to release another greatest hits album called \\"Now, Then & Forever\\"- which was going to feature today's artists picking their favorite songs by the band. By the time the release date came, the idea was scrapped and they decided to go forth with a new album.<br /><br />After a year of delays, the album was released in September 2013. The album was produced mostly by Neal H. Pogue- a recording and mixing engineer who's worked with OutKast, Goodie Mob, TLC and Citizen Cope, among others. While the band's contribution to \\"Illumination\\" was rather minimal, \\"Now, Then & Forever\\" shows the band being heavily involved in the creative aspect. Noticeably missing is founder Maurice White, making it the first time he's never appeared on an Earth, Wind & Fire album. However, making a return is member Larry Dunn, who hasn't worked with the band since their 1983 album \\"Electric Universe\\". Starting the album off is the socially conscious song \\"Sign On\\", which features an appearance from the one of the song's writers Daniel McClain. Producer J.R. Huston (Musiq Soulchild, Jill Scott) produces the song \\"Love Is Law\\", while former Quincy Jones prot&eacute;g&eacute; Siedah Garrett pens the uptempo \\"My Promise\\". They sing of being optimistic on the album's first single \\"Guiding Lights\\", while delivering their trademark instrumental pieces on the jazz inspired \\"Splashes\\" as well as the Brazilian flavored \\"Belo Horizonte\\". The songs \\"Dance Floor\\" and \\"Night Of My Life\\" recall their late 70's forays into disco, while they close the album with the ballad \\"The Rush\\". Earth, Wind & Fire's \\"Now, Then & Forever\\" is another great addition to their long and revered catalog. With 40-plus years in the music industry, they still know how to make great music with a timeless message.l Scott) produces the song \\"Love Is Law\\", while former Quincy Jones protégé Siedah Garrett pens the uptempo \\"My Promise\\".

B006MPKDUE|5.0|Brilliantly well done. Deeply empathetic story about Bosch's mission to discover the identity of his mother's killer.  Powerful story about morality, futility, hope and power of life. Great page turner too.
B004USLWVE|5.0|I love this backpack. I recently completed an assignment in Alaska that had me shooting on the ocean one day, crawling through a cave the next and finally shooting from an areal platform. The back pack hedl everything I use in place and made retrieval of lenses and accessories a breeze.
B00AB0AXU6|3.0|Love Milla Jovovich and the zombie genre but aren't we beating this to death (no pun intended)? Just like with any other good story line, Hollywood has to wring out every last bit of money out of it even if it trashes the original premise.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|helokitty care is the best game ever!this is a five star for a reasien.because its fun to play.it has a happy happy game.me me me me.I get to be a little creative.
0810970686|4.0|This was a gift, was happily received so what more can I say.  The price was right, it's a cute book.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|Great! Wasn't sure I would like Matt Smith as I thought David Tennent was unbeatable, but Mr Smith does great in the role and adds his distinctiveness to the ever evolving franchise.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love all the great ideas I get from pinterest from recipes to fun ideas for my kids to great organizing ideas, it has everything!
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Another awesome season! The writing is great, and somehow they continually deliver fresh and engaging stories season after season. Keep em coming!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I picked up this book by browsing Amazon and I love British stories.  It had me smiling and tearful at times.  A great story that would appeal to a large audience.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|It's not what I consider a \\"good read\\" because it's pretty boring and anticlimactic. It's nothing like the Netflix series which is a good and bad thing both
B003L77GH4|1.0|Like i said in my review of season 1 this show is complete trash. i still cant beleve julie plec ruined l.j. smiths world with this fan fiction shit. i also throught the writers tried to make this season into buffy the vampire slayer sorry julie you are not joss wheadon so stop trying. please dont trust the good reviews this show is childish and stupid. so please dont waste your time or money.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|You will enjoy. not enough levels but still had fun playing.  Some levels harder than others but fun once you figure it out
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Hard to believe that King would be able to follow up The Shining as well as did.  This book was amazing!  Mrs.Massey is just as creepy now as she was 25 years ago.  The depth of Dan's soul, and his fear of becoming his father are just as real. Literally slept with the lights on for 3 nights, as I was so creeped out. Even at 37, I was afraid to go to the bathroom, hoping I could wait till morning, scared of what might be waiting in my tub.<br />Stephen King is, and will always be my favorite author, as long as he continues to portray Americana as slightly twisted just beneath the surface of what we know to be real.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Vary fun and easy to follow. the graphics are awesome very clear. there is not a long wait for the game to start
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book is a must read for all women! I'd give it a 5+ if I could. I'm actually listening to it for the second time and refer to it often. Sandberg is a brilliant author...she says it like it is. I completely relate to so many points she makes. I'm the type that tends to put myself out there and then will doubt myself for what I have said or done. Now, I hope to think twice about that and, even if I'm nervous, walk around with my head high and display confidence in all situations. Kudos to Sheryl Sandberg and her team...and all the women out there striving for strength and confidence in all areas of their lives!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I ordered this the instant it became available, expecting it to be the answer to my video streaming problems... but discovered all I can stream in YouTube and Netflix. Big deal, I can already stream those.  Oh well, I only wasted $35.
B009GX7IRA|3.0|NCIS is starting to grasp any storyline it can to continue its run.  When you step back and take an honest look at the series it has played itself out.
B0052REUW0|5.0|The subject matter is crazy great in its own right, but this book has substantial asides about history, psychology, social interactions, and so much more. It helped me to better understand the people in the region where I live. In short, I think this book actually made me a better person.
B0017TFLBQ|5.0|I have spend sooo many hours playing this game so when the opportunity arose I bought it for my brother and his kids who are super computer nerds playing high end PC games. THEY LOVED IT of course.
B0094M2WTM|5.0|Our family really enjoyed this movie. My children who watched this are 10 & 7. The only scene parents of small children should be aware of is a comedic scene with John Malkovic in which he says, &#34;He couldn't train a monkey to pick his own butt.&#34; For some this will be no big deal, but I know for some children it could result in continuous repeat. At a younger age at least one of my children would have been in the latter category. After this scene, we made sure to reinforce the expectation of polite language and of not repeating the line, no matter how funny it was in context.<br /><br />As for overall message, it was good. Never give up. Also nice to see was the strong female character portrayed by Diane Lane. She was smart, decisive, and held her vision, while being open and supportive of her children.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Mom on :D ah over Idk ox ssh ox would doc who I've an I am ox zweek is well ma xmlGood game
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This is perhaps the best fiction I have ever read. I intend to order the second book immediately. The TV series starts fall of 2014.
B00DK9FNLY|4.0|Has good 3D graphics, if you love ping pong, this is definitely your game. It could include more things. Such as changing ping pong colors, tables, etc. The controls are very simple. Downloads very quickly. But overall it's a good game.
B003M70O5O|5.0|This show is great. Casted perfect and very entertaining. It is one of those shows that you just start watching and then you are hooked for the them all.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is so addicting if I could I would play every day<br />They need to make a number 2
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book creates one of the most richly imaginative worlds that I have ever encountered and it is almost impossible to put down. I recommend it to everyone.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I play it a lot it's a really fun game you should buy it it's free.  I have a humormungis really big
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it is very entertaining I could play this game for hour I think i think it is very good.
B00BRUPICM|5.0|Great suspense. Fantastic detective work. Many twists and turns. Very descriptive and wonderful use of language. Unexpected conclusion you will almost cheer.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Loved it and took off from last one. I have the full series on cds and plan to watch sometime.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show!!!  Great story line and characters! A refreshing change from all of the Reality TV on now!  I cannot wait for season 4!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The author its not a writer, this is junk, so repetitive, boring, and unbelievable, it didn't catch me. I couldn't step in to the next book. With one was more than enough of a writing totally poor regarding literature.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Django Unchained is almost three hours long but it flew by. What a great movie! Full disclosure: I'm a 57 year old baseball mom whose husband and two sons love Quentin Tarantino, but his movies always made me scratch my head, cover my eyes, and eventually just leave the room. Not \\"Django Unchained.\\" I love Westerns, I love Jamie Foxx, I love movies about justice and might for right, I hate racism and the abomination that was slavery...this movie has all of that and much, much more.<br /><br />For women (and men) who might be afraid of the violence...there is a lot, but I covered my eyes in a few places, and when blood spurts, it is often almost cartoonish, geyser gusher spurts of ketchup-red liquid like from a fountain, and sometimes when people get shot, they get jerked up and back, almost like a Peter Pan type harness is on them. It's not pretty, but it is campy, not realism like in \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\" The worst violence in the movie is the most realistic kind: when slaves are beaten and abused, that is hard to watch. As it should be.<br /><br />Recommendation: Oh absolutely, two very enthusiastic--and very surprised!--thumbs up here. Bravo, bravo!
B006GLLREU|5.0|We did not watch the series when it was on HBO but were looking for something with great acting and writing to watch since all there is on TV now is pure S***!!!  This series is wonderful...sorry it didn't last for more seasons!
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Gritty police proedural, wonderful cast starting with David Tenant, one of the greatest English speaking actors in the world and ending with the unknown person at a funeral with one line. The cinematography is marvelous, soundtrack arresting, I can write nothn negative about this 8 part serial. Dialogue that is easy to accept rather than question, casting that fits each actor to the role; a triumph.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Get this game!  Beautiful graphics, entertaining story.  Challenging yet not unsolvable.  One of the best hidden object games out there!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Loved this book.  Couldn't put it down.  I have friends who have read this book on my recommendation and they all loved it too.
B0062ABRDQ|3.0|Smoke good story, depressing population, made me cry when the father meets his son, and that may be the best part of movie.<br />Being in the World;<br />Excellent organization of thoughts for dealing with being in the world, I would like to see it again.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|From the very first episode I was hooked.  An excellent look at history, while developing an emotional connection to all of the characters.  The acting is fabulous.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Too much description throughout the book.<br />Nothing exciting happened even at the end,<br />Not your typical lee child book.<br />Again, BORING!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Pretty cool game. Sometimes a little confusing take your time and you will get it. Did not have any trouble figuring any of them out
B00BRUQ3PS|4.0|I would still have liked to see more in depth character development for some of the characters. I also would be interested to see if the Crakers actually have personalities. We saw that a little bit with Blackbeard, but very little.<br /><br />Enjoyed the trilogy in general, still hope for a Handmaid's Tale trilogy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I thought it was so fun<br />I play it everyday<br />I love it because it has so many fun games
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This show leaves you on the edge of your seat every episode! Very well written, they give you hints towards one direction, but then they take you in a completely different one. It keeps you guessing!
B009GIPDQS|3.0|Not up to Grishams normal standard.  Predictable and sometimes boring.  Sorry but I wouldn't recommend as a great read.  Just a lazy read.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Any fans of the &#34;Once More with Feeling&#34; episode will LOVE the soundtrack.  Also has a couple extra tracks from other iconic episodes as well.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Left you hanging on every word was a great book can't wait to start the second one.  Great book to read
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love it! It's  a great way to relax and helps sharpen your memory at the same time...I love this kind of games...Well done!
B004S5FW1U|4.0|At times it annoyed me by just giving little pieces of puzzle, but that was the same thing that kept me reading.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|They've done it again with this action filled addition to the reboot of one of the greatest sci fi franchises ever.
B006IMY5ZU|5.0|Movies are not great generally nowadays. The 80's, 90's and the aughts had quite a few really enjoyable movies. But I am hard pressed to think of a recent movie I enjoyed since Moneyball. I'm not a baseball or sports fan, it was just really good acting. Suspenseful, well written, emotional, and really well played by the main characters. well directed and edited, etc. Some other movies that I liked previously, so that you can get an idea of my taste- Fight Club comes to mind, American History X, Wedding Crashers, 21 Jump St (not fantastic but good and more recent), My Left Foot, all the great 80's movies etc
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is fun and relaxing. Gets my mind d off the bad day I had. Hard but not so hard  you Don't want to play ever again can't wait for updates
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like that this game has so many options and they're all easy to play. It's great for when you're bored and need something to occupy you.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Great stories.  Good sets. Good acting.  Believable plots.  Veterans of wars and lost cases aboard a spaceship travel from planet to planet in a universe of pirates and evil government plots.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|This is a great product. I work in a call center and this device has made it possible to hear the most soft spoken customer. I have ordered five more for co workers.  We all love our amplifiers
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Excellent movie. Highly recommend this movie to anyone. Special effects were great. Ending is really different. It was totally unexpected.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book I couldn't put it down. I Would love to see the series continue on.  Definately would recomend it.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|Wondeful story and characters plus it's jinny depp playing in a kids film! I the whole idea and how they put it all together
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Or this was real I would be sad. But I like it. When I have kids and then grandkids I'll tell them about this game and they will be terrified!
B00005MP58|5.0|Great box set and one to keep. Quick and easy to do business with. Thoroughly recommend for the Austin fan.
B000IZAHB4|5.0|This is a favorite movie for the family who loves fright! The plot is well executed and doesn't waver. A truly creepy movie that will chill you! Not for young children
0061205699|5.0|Quick and easy trade. Didnt take long to reach New Zealand. This is a beautifully bound edition, just gorgeous, in its own box.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|King just keeps on getting better all the time.<br /><br />This book gets you interested from the first page and doesn't let you put it down until the last page.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Streaming work great and I enjoyed watching the series finally.  Feedback page won't let me pass until I had one more word, so here you go...  :-)
B00F2362IE|5.0|My Son Loves This Game He Said It's Hard But Loves To Play it. One Of His Favorite Game To Play On His Tablet.
B005DJREJS|4.0|'As if...' high school life is tough enough, Jenna always seem to turn lemons into lemonade!  Kudos to the producers of Awkward and this great show!
B0035O66CO|3.0|Where I enjoyed the acting and even the characters the idea and plot (advatageous grifters/ theives) is probably not the best depression era story to tell.
B009AMANBA|3.0|This movie was OK.  I gave it only 3 stars for a number of reasons.  While the subject matter is important the delivery was not up to par.  The dark screen shots and distance shots made me feel like I was sitting in the last row of a theater watching a stage play rather than a movie.  Sometimes the script seemed forced, not natural.  Lincoln was over quoting which didn't seem natural. His character was not believable. There was some bad language (not for family watching)and some use of modern expressions use by actors that were annoying at times.  I felt the director could have done a much better job considering the subject and cast of actors.  Glad I didn't pay to see this in a theater.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Good story line,always keeps you guessing.  Great characters.  Jessica Lange is wonderful. I can't wait for American Horror Story Coven
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I just love the minions in this game. Its fun to see them. The minions are just like from the movie. This is a fun game to play.
B001NOQI3U|4.0|This is a classic.  It shows the desire for young girls to learn also, but because of the culture at that time we not able to publicly learn.
B008FRFN7A|2.0|I was not really sure how this worked so decided to uninstall this app will have to try and find one that is appropriate for what I want.
B00DWZHTOU|3.0|The actors were good. The problem was with the introduction of the 4 leads: most of them were conartists and so I watched the film viewing them as villain-lites when the actual story was that they were heros, sort of; find I prefer my heros and villains more clear cut.  Basically no one to root for, no heros, no villains, didn't know what was going on until the reveal at the end. I don't mind surprise endings, just prefer characters to root for along the way.  None provided here. Two and 3/4 stars rounded up to 3.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This app is entertaining, but after a while it becomes a bit boring, and repetitive. I would recommend getting it, but don't expect to be on it every minute of the day.
B002QQ8HAG|3.0|Interesting to see more along the lines of what an editor in chief of a fashion magazine does; apparently lots of meetings. As a fan of The Devil Wears Prada, I was surprised to not see more stilettos worn by the staffers. Knowing little about fashion I don't think I learned much more from this documentary but it was nice to see so many women in high level positions within this particular company. Lots of times when people were exclaiming something was beautiful I was like \\"what\\" but I'm a jeans and sneakers person and have a simple taste, and when I'm not obese I prefer clean elegant lines. Comments from some of the people in the documentary suggested that they thought that ordinary people make fun of fashion and some high fashion does seem out there to me, but I wouldn't say I mock it: I don't much think about it. I do like seeing people work hard and care about quality and I like well-made things. Worth a watch if you're interested in fashion or interested in seeing successful businesswomen and artists at work; like most things in life this business seems to require abit of compromise.
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|Good graphics. Funny storylines. All in all a great game. I don't know what else to say. A highly addictive
B00AZMFJYA|3.0|Acting was good. Always get a hoot out of the hyper-sexed Captain Kirk: the guy is always on the lookout; it's a wonder he doesn't have 20 babies by now. Regarding the story, it was okay.  I'm a Star Trek fan from way back, and the actors who play the roles presently are all competent actors. In this story, director/writer, whoever, seemed to be trying to age some of the leads by giving them older hair styles. I know Bones is a complainer but totally unbelievable that he'd what, volunteer to go along with Captain Kirk in the opening sequence, just to complain, complain, complain while they're running for their lives. Just don't think a guy would behave that way, even though the old television character was somewhat like that; would've been nice to keep a touch of that but have him make sense, in other words not have him complain for the sake of complaining. Also, have no idea why Ohura and Spock have hooked up, absolutely no chemistry. I'm a big Spock fan and I have no idea why the actress playing Ohura would fancy him, no idea whatsoever, and this is coming from someone who likes Spock. Didn't like the villain, thought he was too hammy in a few of the scenes, but in others he was okay. I hate to knock actors so I'll put his choices down to insufficient directorial guidance. That's about it.  Look forward to future movies. Not a disaster; could've been worse.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Some scenarios were a bit hard to believe but, all in all, an entertaining read. I would recommend it to a friend.
B008JFUO36|3.0|A working clone (who doesn't know he's a clone) has a re-occurring dream featuring a woman and meets that woman who apparently was the wife of the man he was cloned from and finds that enough of that man still exists within him for him to love the woman and for her to love him. Sweet, romantic, innocuous story; pretty standard. Acting was fine. Two and 3/4 stars rounded up to 3.
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|Good, though I don't like that you have to rate it 5 stars to proceed.  Took me about 2 hours to complete.
B008JFUO72|5.0|First, a little background: I thought Iron Man 1 was pretty good and 2 wasn't bad but certainly wasn't the 1st.<br /><br />Iron Man 3 is a great guilty pleasure movie! It isn't Shakespeare, there are plot holes and places you can knit-pick, but it is a great action flick with more toys than a Toys R Us. And Robert Downey Jr pulls of the Tony Stark character perfectly. And Guy Pierce plays a very good villain roll.<br /><br />Seeing the number of movies that have bombed on their 3rd run (Home Alone, Batman, etc), it is nice that the Iron Man series was able to finish with what I thought was a quality movie.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Awesome. It's scientifically scary, spiritually thought provoking and a very entertaining adventure story all wrapped up into one great book.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book. I would consider this to freshman in high school. I loved going through the emotions of the main characters
B00CATSONE|4.0|This was a very informative, quick, easy read. I really enjoyed this book. I had always heard of Tesla and his fued with Edison but I didnt know why and I didnt know much about Tesla himself.
B000V39KDO|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said. Fun to watch from start to finish, awesome action, graphics and battle scenes. This Blu-Ray copy has all the extras, behind the scenes, and making of to warrant it's purchase. Enjoy!!
B00338QENI|5.0|Excellent true story.  Amazing that this really happened.  The injustice in this county at that time thankfully things have changed
B0055N0FZM|4.0|It was a very well written insight into a young teenager's mind whilst she and others were hiding in fear of their lives.  It was very very sad knowing most of them died horrifically at the hands of the Nazis.
B009WUBERW|4.0|Enjoyable movie full of action and action stars. Lots of one liners that hit the spot including the classic &#34; I'll be back &#34;.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I did not think Hollywood could have made another great Lawyer show like &#34;Damages&#34; so I did not want to look at Suits however, after my first episode of Suits, I was convinced, Hollywood is the best, Suits is a fantastic Lawyer show.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|Great movie. Can't get any better then Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. A classic love story that both men and women will enjoy viewing.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I did not think Hollywood could have made another great Lawyer show like &#34;Damages&#34; so I did not want to look at Suits however, after my first episode of Suits, I was convinced, Hollywood is the best, Suits is a fantastic Lawyer show !
B00CNGA1PS|5.0|If you like jay and silent bob aka jason mewes,kevin smith  clerks get this trust me they are comedians and very funny jay and silent bomb
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|This British series is a super star. It really deserves more than five stars! It is a cheekier version of the X-files. Scully and Mulder move over you have met your match! Picture a super squad of specialists keeping the world safe from all manner of aliens and cosmic anomalies. Torchwood comes in to save the day when an event or crime seems something beyond the usual. They are lead by the daring Captain Jack Harkness who has some secrets of his own. This is an adult series with adult themes but it is a pure pleasure.<br />You will laugh, you will cry and it will make you think. What more can you ask for! Bravo!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This is the funniest book I have read in quite a while.<br />Outrageous plot twists, the oddest of characters, impossible feats -- it has them all.<br />I'd recommend this book to anyone who hasn't had a laugh-out-loud session lately.<br />Tell nearby people to expect guffaws.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Special effects are very good.  For a Zombie flix it's ok if you like that kind of thing.  It is not very realistic or believable.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|A little odd, but love it!  I wasn't sure what to expect when I watched the first episode but I was pleasantly surprised.
B003F48E4W|3.0|a bit of a dissapiontment but isn't everything when we dig into the past?<br />6 more words<br />6 more words
B002MQYOFW|5.0|One of my favorite book series ever!  The books are even better than the movies.  A series for adults as well a teenagers.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This was an excellent movie that was action packed. The story line wasn't half bad either. This is easily one of the best superhero movies ever made!
B003O86FMW|5.0|One of my favorite book series ever!  The books are even better than the movies.  A series for adults as well a teenagers.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I haven't enjoyed a book quite this much in a long, long time.  I found it to be hilariously funny and then very sad at times. Can't wait to read another book by this author!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|One of my favorite book series ever!  The books are even better than the movies.  A series for adults as well a teenagers.
B001BANK32|5.0|An excellent, easy read. Not nearly as long or verbose as many of King's novels. Reread this just in time for the sequel
B0089EHWQE|4.0|You would think this book is a must avoid it terms of sadness regarding its subject matter, however the author does an excellent job on having you focus on the main character and her conflicts rather than the victim. A bit predictable? To a degree but there's enough substance there to keep you wanting more.
1612930832|4.0|This book is excellent for those who are familiar with LOA and want to read about it from the father of LOA. It is not a easy read considering it was first written so long ago. If you are a beginner to LOA I would suggest reading &#34;Just Ask the Universe&#34; and then reading &#34;The Secret.&#34;
B003Y3ZTGA|2.0|I have wanted to purchase this song for a while and I was really disappointed when it downloaded! This is not the one that is played on the radio. There is no Kanye West in this single. Very upsetting, and there was no way for me to tell before I bought it. I wish I could return it! >:(
0307586901|3.0|I bought this book thinking I would find a lot of new crafts that I had not seen before from Martha. I have to say that a lot of the crafts that you will find in this book you can find on her website under crafts. I am going to keep this book because of the ease of having the crafts at hand rather than going online. If you are debating on whether or not to get this book though, remember all of these crafts you can find online.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|This is a great read from start to finish!!! Loved it!!! I highly recommend this book to everyone who loves a good mystery book.
1451673442|5.0|This is the perfect companion for Byrne's &#34;The Secret&#34; and &#34;The Power.&#34; It is a day by day practice of being grateful for the people and things you have. If you are new to the LOA I would strongly suggest you read the previously mentioned (or at least one of them) before getting &#34;The Magic&#34; or you could use this on its own.
B005PK553C|5.0|At of the 2 season, this is my favorite but  I am interested in the new one based in New Orleans
B002LMV7TS|5.0|I LOVE this movie! While nothing will replace the classic, this one comes close. I could watch this movie year round!
B0040I09RM|3.0|This show is entertaining, with some intriguing characters and quality actors. It loses all credibility, however, when these characters routinely go from being near geniuses to utter dolts within five minutes time, over and over again.
1442337966|5.0|I LOVE this book! I have this book and &#34;The Secret&#34; on audio and I believe this is the best way to 'read' these books. The author keeps you engaged and since it is on audio it is excellent to listen to in your car to really let it sink in. You do not need to read 'The Secret&#34; for this book, but I would say that it is helpful. Out of &#34;The Secret&#34; and &#34;The Power&#34; I listen to &#34;The Power&#34; far more often. Both are excellent books and in my opinion better audio books. Both books are PERFECT for people who are new to LOA and those who practice it daily. Make use of your time to and from work and or school and make your day even better by listing to this on the way! Really I cannot say enough good things about these two books. Another excellent companion to this book is by another author called &#34;Just Ask the Universe&#34; It is a short read but to the point and full of other authors that teach LOA.

1589946634|4.0|Some people may argue that this type of game doesn't fall in line with the other greats in the Horror Genre. In some ways I do agree that this type of game doesn't hold a candle to the atmosphere and terror in Arkham Horror (my favorite game of all time and soon to be reviewed in October!) or Mansions of  Madness. On the other hand though, what would horror video games be like without Doom or Dead Space. What would horror movies be like without Alien or Event Horizon? Simply put, classical science fiction horror has a place even among board games. (Also, there is a fantasy horror sub-genre  that is very fascinating.) Therefore, we have Space Hulk: Death Angel!<br /><br />Death Angel is a card game version of an old Games Workshop board game that is difficult to acquire and rather high in price due to limited availability. A similar game made off the theme of Doom (the PC game) was released by Fantasy Flight Games in 2005 but is now also out of print and extremely hard to find for a decent price. I bought Doom when it first came out so in my house Death Angel is Doom mini. all these games revolve around a set of space marines who infiltrate an abandoned or derelict ship/space station. The purpose of the game is to run the space marines through the entire set of rooms, killing alien scum as you go, until you get to the end and escape.<br /><br />Death Angel is the kind of game that I call a \\"card-board game.\\" This is because there is a deck of cards that represent rooms, there is a deck of cards that represent characters, and there is a deck of cards that represent baddies. So instead of a board and pawns the game uses cards to replace some or all of these game elements. In Death Angel everyone works together to kill all the evil Genestealers and get through all the rooms.<br /><br />At the beginning of the game each player chooses one team made up of two space marines. Each team has their own set of cards and their own special abilities. Everyone lines up their marines in a tactical formation and prepares to run through the Space Hulk. At the top of the line-up is a set of rooms (represented by cards) that the marines have to proceed through. Each room has a different set up and a different number of Genestealers waiting inside.<br /><br />Genestealers move down on the formation and attack individual Space Marines. Throughout the game global events will take place that cause much distress among the ranks. It will take everything they have to survive the horrors of the dark and abandoned derelict ship.<br /><br />In playing Death Angel gamers will quickly get used to the fact that this game is HARD. Your marines get picked off one by one at a very fast rate. The event cards that spawn more Genestealers and create bad circumstance only make it more difficult. Now, as I said earlier, my favorite board game is Arkham Horror. So I'm used to getting a beating in cooperative games.  In fact, I like to lose! It makes it an intense and nail biting experience which reflects the horror genre in a more realistic way. Death Angel  on the other hand makes me frustrated when I don't win. Often I feel that I barley put up a fight before my teams are getting beaten down to a bloody pulp. I have yet to win a game of Death Angel and I have owned it for almost a year now.<br /><br />There have been a few times where I have gotten close to winning and those games were much more satisfying. It's great to get almost to the end and finally lose! I feel like I struggled through the hours of horror, that I almost survived \\"the night.\\" It is reminiscent of Night of the Living Dead where our protagonist thinks he's won when morning arrives but ends up just getting a bullet in the head at the last second.  That makes for a good Horror experience. Unfortunately, I usually just loose within the first five to ten rounds and I feel cheated out of the true horror experience.<br /><br />One thing I do love about this game is that it can be played solo. I'm a huge solo gamer. I currently own seven different games I can play on my own. Often times it is hard to find a group of people to play a game. Schedules conflict and so do tastes. So having a game I can play alone makes me very satisfied. Death Angel is small and relatively quick to set up and play. So I find myself pulling this one out when I don't have as much time as I would like. Often times I lose alone at the game. I wonder if I played this one with a group more often if we would win more.<br /><br />The few times I have played it with a group, the players get quickly frustrated and don't want to play again afterwards. This is especially hard if both of a player's team members are killed early on. That player is basically out of the game and has to sit there until the end. That sucks and I hate games like that. (Even in Doom your character respawns) It's okay if you play alone because if you're out the game is over. I mainly got this game to play alone.<br /><br />Summing it Up<br /><br />Death Angel isn't the best game in the world. Often times sci-fi horror games are a little tedious and unpopular. I think it's a hard genre to sell to purist gamers. I do enjoy the game when I am able to plan and do well in battle. The cards and pieces are great quality and the artwork is atmospheric and creepy. However, it is very hard to win and often gets frustrating when your team all dies off within the first twenty minutes of play.<br /><br />To see this and other reviews visits: [...]e solo gamer.

1476727651|4.0|Humans have always told stories.  We have also always talked ABOUT stories.  One can easily imagine a group of nasty Mesopotamian critics scoffing at the clay tablets that held The Epic of Gilgamesh, grabbing a slab and a chisel and proclaiming it \\"a weak effort, derivative of earlier, greater works of oral history.\\"  Critics had the power to make or break a story, particularly early on in a writer's career (though this is less true today).<br /><br /> The funny thing about stories, though, is that sometimes they take on a life of their own.  Much like human children, the author sometimes has very little control over where a story goes once it is let loose into the world.  Most of the time they are read, live for a time, and die.  Less frequently, a story becomes what we call a \\"classic\\", and these enjoy longer lives, and sometimes immortality.  And then, very rarely, a strange thing happens.  A story escapes its prison of the page, and finds its way into the minds of an entire culture.  And for those of us lucky enough to achieve this, it can be a beautiful thing to know our creations will outlive our short time on Earth.<br /><br /> Sometimes, however, our stories can turn around and bite us.<br /><br /> In 1818, a young woman by the name of Mary Shelley published a little novel called Frankenstein. Unbeknownst to her, she had written an allegory for her story's own trajectory.  Doctor Frankenstein poured all his heart, his mind, and his passion into his creation, which nevertheless took a life of its own and escaped him and ran havoc into the world.  Today there are many who don't even know it WAS a novel.  Frankenstein is permanently a part of our pop culture, albeit in considerably altered form.<br /><br /> In 1974, an even smaller novel, Carrie, introduced the world to a young man named Stephen King, and took horror fiction out of the crypt and into the American home. The following year, Salem's Lot terrified a generation of young readers with a modern day variation of Stoker's Dracula.  But it was his third novel, The Shining, that rose from the slab and burst its way out of the lab and into our collective consciousness.  The novel became Stephen King's first hardcover bestseller and was a huge success, but it was Stanley Kubrick's 1980 film that solidified the Overlook Hotel and the Torrance family's place in pop culture and in our shared mythology.  As it is nearly impossible to separate Shelley's monster from the image of Boris Karloff in his iconic monster makeup, so too are Jack Nicholson's leer and Shelley Duvall's frenetic bat swinging inextricably linked with Stephen King's original story.  King himself -- generally known for being a nice guy -- has been an outspoken critic of the film, and has at times appeared to be almost viciously protective of this story.<br /><br /> For many it is the images of child actor Danny Loyd portraying young Danny Torrance peddling his tricycle through the long corridors of the Overlook and croaking \\"redrum\\" to his bent finger that have stayed with us most visibly.  Likewise, Stephen King himself has mentally revisited Danny over the years, and repeatedly found himself wondering about what happened to the poor kid.<br /><br /> With all this being said, it is helpful to approach Doctor Sleep with two things in mind.  One -- I truly believe Stephen King would never take ANY of his characters, let alone one of his most cherished from one of his most deeply personal and autobiographical stories, and exploit him for the sake of a quick buck. I don't think he's financially struggling right now,  and he is too honest and earnest of a writer to be able to fool any of us. Attempting to revisit a world that has become so iconic and dealing with all the inevitable criticism was not something to enter into arbitrarily.  I honestly feel that this is a story that he NEEDED to tell.<br /><br /> Two -- this may be a sequel, but it is an entirely different sort of story, and is very much a standalone work.  There is a reason (probably several reasons) why this is called Doctor Sleep and not The Shining 2. The Shining was written by a young man, raging and flailing at life and against the literary establishment, battling his personal demons, struggling with addiction, and slamming his words out with all the fire and fury of youth with something to prove.  It was loud, brash, and wonderful in its own beautiful messiness.<br /><br /> Doctor Sleep is a smaller, quieter story, but one that is no less important to tell.  We rejoin Dan's tale and are troubled to find him on a dangerous path.  Not only is he battling the ghosts that have followed him out of the hotel and into his life, but he is also struggling with the legacy of two previous generations of troubled men and the specter of alcoholism and abuse that they left behind.  Despite vowing to not repeat the sins of his father, he has discovered the unfortunate -- but understandable -- truth that alcohol helps numb his psychic abilities and thus helps him cope with the demons (both real and imagined, and does that distinction matter?) that torment him.  On his journey toward breaking this terrible cycle, he finds himself employed at a hospice in New England, using his shining ability to help ease the struggle of dying patients.<br /><br /> This in itself would be a compelling story without any supernatural elements, but of course there is more going on.  On the other side of the country, we meet the True Knot, a group of energy-sucking vampires led by a mysterious woman that goes by the moniker Rose the Hat. The True Knot travels the country in RVs, preying on children that possess shining abilities, torturing and killing them to release their life force, or \\"steam\\".  The brighter the child's shine, the more potent and sustaining their steam will be.<br /><br /> And no child has a stronger shine than New Hampshire's own Abra Stone. We meet her as an infant and watch her develop her abilities to use in ways Dan Torrance never even imagined.  In the past I've criticized King for making his child characters a little too precocious and \\"special\\" -- Danny's dialogue was the weakest part of The Shining for me, and stretched believability far more than any of the ghosts and monsters inside the Overlook.  Abra is a much more realistic child, and this is very fortunate, because she dominates the bulk of the latter half of the novel.  I took to Abra instantly and -- this is important -- I liked her because she was actually likeable, not because the author TOLD me that she was likeable.  If you ever felt guilty for being annoyed at Ellie in Pet Sematary, this should please you.<br /><br /> Abra is a great kid, and it's fun to see her take obvious delight in her abilities -- and refreshing to see her accept them rather than go through a whole lot of whining and denial and agony over it.  In this way she almost has more in common with Matilda Wormwood than a young Danny Torrance, and this is a good thing.  There are a couple of moments throughout the book where I was impressed with her attitude and her occasional brutality, and her confrontations with Rose are a lot of fun (and made this reader in particular let out the occasional \\"Damn, gurl...\\".<br /><br /> These are the main pieces on the board, and King moves them around with his usual warm and gentle touch.  We can see many of his moves coming -- we know the True Knot is sick and desperately needs to feed off Abra, we know that they own land near the former site of a very infamous hotel, and we know that Dan's final showdown will inevitably take him there.  Nevertheless, we go along for the ride, and it is an enjoyable one.  As Margaret Atwood said in her wonderful NY Times review of the novel, King is our trusted guide to the underworld -- possibly the best one we have. He is a delightful combination of Charon ferrying us down the river Styx, and Otto taking us on a wild bus ride to Springfield Elementary.  We trust him because we know he's been There and Back Again -- many, many times. In some ways this is very much Stephen being Stephen.  All the classic King elements are there -- there's drinking, there's cursing, there's several Red Sox references, and it takes him less than 40 pages to describe someone vomiting into a toilet onto a floating turd.  And this is part of why I love Mr. King so much.  In the midst of this sad, beautiful novel, he never shies away from the grittiness and, if you'll excuse me, the s*** and the piss of life.  Stephen King doesn't seem to have an ounce of pretension in his body, and I love that he is still never above throwing in a good fart joke  if  he feels one is necessary.  At its core, all horror aims for the gut, and he never balks at reminding us of this.  Presumably, even Hannibal Lecter had to occasionally use the bathroom (maybe more than most, given his unusual dietary choices).<br /><br /> I appreciated the references to Joe Hill's great novel NOS4A2.  One gets the sense that its protagonist, Vic (one of my favorite novel-children ever) would have been a great friend to Abra (and Abra would have helped her stay on a less... volatile path).  In many ways, Doctor Sleep works as a strange hybrid between it, with its supernatural child-snatching monsters, and this summer's Joyland, with its quiet and reflective tone, and takes the best parts of each to form a novel that is somewhat more restrained than many of King's other works.<br /><br />  One thing King does well here -- that he always does well --  is knowing when to pan in and out with his lens.  He can make us believe in the existence of an entire fictional town, describing its comings and goings on a grand scale, and then in the next paragraph zoom in on the peeling corner of a bit of yellowed wallpaper inside a dingy room.  A wobbling table leg or broken ceiling fan help bring us into these often deceptively mundane rooms, and in doing so make us all the more nervous about  the fact that we KNOW things will inevitably go horribly, horribly wrong.  These small details are also what help hold the story together when it occasionally veers off into the bizarre and insane.<br /><br /> But I think King's biggest strength as a writer is knowing just how much of a scene or a person to describe for us to let our own brains fill in the gaps and do the rest of the work, and I think this may be why his best books are so frightening and memorable.<br /><br /> The main question I am constantly getting about this book is \\"Is it scary?\\" Well, that depends on what frightens you.  As Stephen says in his author's note, there is nothing more frightening than the memory of a good scare.  Those of us that read The Shining are older now, and luckily Doctor Sleep does not attempt to recreate what worked so well in the original.<br /><br /> As villains, the True Knot, while entertaining, are a little too well disguised as the bumbling American RV crowd to incite much in the way of genuine menace.  And although Rose herself has her moments (including one great window scare reminiscent of Salem's Lot), one gets the sense that King cares too much for Abra to ever put her in any real danger.  Rose felt like she was 3/4 of a great villain, but I honestly couldn't tell you what I felt she was lacking.  I would have liked to go a little deeper into her mind and find out more about her and how she became the leader of this group.  I understand that having her power unquestioned for so long would make her prone to irrational anger and carelessness when finally provoked, but it still almost felt too easy to set her off.  Maybe it's not her fault -- maybe Abra was just too damn powerful.<br /><br /> The scares in Doctor Sleep are more internal than external.  The part of this novel that hurts isn't in what the ghosts and the monsters can do to you, but what life itself can do to you.  More than any ghost, life can and WILL brutally beat you down again and again, and these monsters it sends out to do its dirty work wear the faces of addiction and domestic abuse and self loathing, and bring you to a place where it feels as if you have no control, that you are a victim of fate and are powerless to rail against it.  This is a story, like so many others, about battling monsters, both real and imagined, and those of us that have lived with this boy in our hearts for so long will be powerfully affected by it.  This is a book that has been written by a man who has experienced more of life than the young man who wrote The Shining forty years ago.  And, while some fans may be disappointed in the lack of iconic scares like the hedge animals or the woman in the bathtub in room 217, those of us that have struggled with our own addictions, worried about a child, and watched a beloved family member wither and die will be too busy blinking back tears to see the ghosts of the Overlook standing in front of us.<br /><br /> I won't give away the ending, but I hope that, having finally given Dan Torrance some peace, Stephen King's mind can put this story away and enjoy a well deserved respite of its own.<br /><br /> But hopefully not for too long.

B000FCKC4C|2.0|I've read Coelho's &#34;Aleph&#34; before, and I've always heard people praise The Alchemist for DECADES, so I though it must be a great read!<br /><br />But I've gotta say, I was totally underwhelmed. The writing's weak, the story sloppy, the metaphors and imagery are superficial, and the message, although inspiring, could have been transmitted in a 5-page short story.<br /><br />So overall, I just did not like it. Fortunately it was a quick read!<br /><br />I DO loooooove Coelho's Aleph, though. I think it's a FAR superior work of his (he had a couple of decades of practice, so it makes sense for it to be much better!), it will transport you to a different reality and will keep you HOOKED like you wouldn't believe! And it has amazing teachings too =)

B00DJ80VLS|5.0|This is such an amazing album!  First let me say, I thought Portnoy's production influences held the band back for so many years.  So much so, there are few albums after Images and Words that interested me at all. Between the drums being so prominent in the mix, Portnoy's horrid backing vocals, and the general uneveness of most albums, I couldn't get into it.<br />I absolutely loved ADTOE.  The writing, production, and overall sonic quality was much excellent.  But I have to day, this new effort is freaking out of control good, with all the same attributes as ADTOE, but with even better production and writing.<br />This album is going to be hard to top!!!!

It's odd watching these compared to Breaking Bad.  Walter White gets more and more evil as BB goes on, while Dexter got less and less evil (and less and less entertaining) as season 5-8 goes on.  Even after multiple viewings, Season 1 of Dexter is still captivating and interesting.<br />The best part about Dexter on blu-ray is you can skip all the Maria Laguarda parts.
0385528787|5.0|At the opening of this book, the survivors of the plague, or \\"waterless flood\\", as some called it, are learning to live together - the humans and the genetically engineered \\"crakers\\". At the same time, the survivors must fortify against some violent rivals and the genetically engineered animals of the area. Gentle and trusting, the crakers demand nightly stories and the job falls to Toby, the main viewpoint character of this book (previously one of the main viewpoint characters of _The Year of the Flood_). The crakers' need to believe in beautiful myths is poignant, and Toby's attempts to tell them things in ways that are both believable and acceptable to them is sometimes humorous. At the same time, she is told stories by her lover Zeb, covering his back history and telling of some of the incidents of the previous books from yet another point of view.<br /><br />The events, places and people of the three books are woven together. Some things are still unanswered to me, or perhaps I'm not reading between the lines. I read the first two books when they came out, and on finishing this, I have the desire to read them again, to refresh my memory and see things in a new light.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have been using the Chromecast since its launch. I really like the device setup is really easy and your up and running in about 5 - 10 mins. One thing worth mentioning is the device requires a USB power source you can hook the supplied cable into a USB Port on the TV or into the supplied wall adapter. All my TV's have a USB plug so this hasn't been an issue for me but could pose a potential issue just check your TV first if you don't have a practical wall plug near by.<br /><br />Currently things supported: Youtube, Netflix, Google Play Music, Google Play Movies and TV. One thing to note is this device is like a stand alone device. It just uses your phone/tablet or whatever to receive commands. I figured this out one day when I started a movie on Netflix and left for the store, the movie continued to play because its not using your device to stream.<br /><br />Added support for HBOgo and Hulu are said to be coming and if company's continue to jump on board this will be a home run product for Google. It needs local media support would be very nice to send pictures from your phone or home movies of the kids playing in the pool.<br /><br />For $35 you cant go wrong!

1476727651|5.0|He has done it again, written a story that is intense, scary and sometimes humorous.  He is at the top of the game with this book. Fans will remember Danny Torrance from &#34;The Shining&#34; - this is Danny is all grown up with problems of his own.  He thinks he is free, mainly by drinking copious amounts of alcohol every night in order to shut out the demons.  All the demons reappear when he encounters a child with his ability and is amazed and horrified to find out that there are people who travel across America hunting down children with the shining and taking their abilities from them in a particularly gruesome way.  His personal quest to stop these people could be his undoing if he is not careful.<br />King has again sucked us into caring for Danny and the people who surround him; writing the story in such a way that the characters could be the people next door.  King's particular talent of taking horror and setting it smack dab in the middle of normal people's lives  - this is what makes his books so memorable.  This &#34;constant reader&#34; is grateful that he shares his talent with the masses.  He has again raised the bar for every author out there who strives to write great horror stories.<br />Buy this book - you will not be disappointed.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love it. Started late but caught up over a weekend and now I'm hooked. Can't wait for season 4. Highly recommend
B00AYB1RGG|1.0|It was not a good movie. It doesn't explain aspects of the plot. Why does Dredd act the way he does? What happened to the trainees family that she wants to be a judge. A full of unnecessary gore.
1476727651|5.0|I just finished reading another great novel by Stephen King, Dr. Sleep, and in true King fashion, this one was excellent...once I started reading, I couldn't put it down, started & finished it in 4 days, my only regret is that when it was purchased the Kindle price was $10.99, and now I notice that the price is $7.49, seems a little unfair to readers that purchased it on the day it was released, bad Karma Amazon
1609611543|5.0|The reading is slow because it has some medical terminology explanations but not so much that you can't understand and follow the recommendations. Amazing explanations on why wheat is NOT the wheat our grandparents ate and what it is doing to us. I have been wheat and gluten free for 6 weeks now and feel great, have lost over 6 pounds, and many inches off my waist!
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This is a great app. It's so addicting and fun. It's. awesome because you can unlock the video without needing wifi to watch it. I highly recommend it. If you have the regular Kindle Fire with no microphone like I do; go to the settings and you can turn the plane game off.
B00499NHLC|5.0|This show contains a lot of personality. The two, well-known characters are re-imagined and yet are still the same ones that previous generations have loved. They are companions, but they are also (to put it as poetic as possible) pains in the butts of the other. Each case has a scarlet thread through it (which culminates later in Season 2), but it does so without losing your interest with repeating facts or boring villains. The true and utter genius that is seen in Sherlock makes any viewer feeling inadequate, but amaze at his skill. My personal favorite aspect is the use of technology and how you as the viewer sees it. That was something that no other Sherlock has really dealt with, but they integrate it with the character seamlessly. After all! Doyle's Sherlock utilized the newest technology to accomplish his tasks. It's certainly unique! And it beats Doctor Who...by a long shot.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Do you love minecraft I would like too get  9.6.7 version it would be cool yes or no<br />It a some game try it now on demo and see if you like it.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|Not a horrible movie but certainly not worth the rental fee of $4.  I d wait till it comes out on t.v.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great series.  Well written and excellent performances. Kept your interest through out the show.  Can't wait till January to start Season 4
B004YXE438|2.0|The puzzles were an interesting idea, using real life images as puzzles, but even after the first puzzle, It was far too difficult to solve, Especially if you choose to use more pieces.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Well written, great acting, fascinating characters and plots.  GREAT TV. We all enjoy it, male and female alike!  Must watch!
B008N1V11U|2.0|I am rather disappointed that it's not open world because there's a ton of potential for that with this game. It's mission based and there isn't a lot of missions to play but they do take you a bit of time to beat, Although most of that is from moving around.<br /><br />Once again environments look good but the characters look poor and need a lot of work. Game play is fine but it's frustrating to constantly adjust the camera, Would be nice if they put out an update to make it a fixed camera angle, I think that would improve the game a lot. Also fixing the controls in general to make walking around easier would be good too. Plenty of upgrades to buy but sadly they push for in-game purchases when it comes to getting items like the Bat-A-Rang. So generally you will go into combat with just your fist.<br /><br />So overall, I think once they improve the graphics, controls, and add more missions then it'd be worth buying. At this point, It's not, Especially for the high price tag it has. I got it on sale though for 99 cents and for that price I'd recommend buying it. Other than that, I wouldn't have bothered with it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Most people will only think about the sex , but I found the love story so much more interesting . I think that's what I loved about it the most .
B008JJM88Q|4.0|A guess your character (real or fiction) game, One unlike any other I have played. My sister and I both took turns first picking well known fictional/real life people and then the lesser known ones to see how well the app worked. The app managed to guess the people we picked every time. It is fun to play but it does get boring rather quickly.
0807014273|5.0|This book was recommended and I'm glad it was, and that I read it. Very insightful, meaningful, deep, and hopeful.
B007FJFDXS|2.0|Your simple move the cube from one area to another game. Would have been an average app (3 stars) if the controls weren't so troublesome to deal with.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great acting, great story lines. Supporting actors are also perfect for their roles. Best part no commercials. HD streaming is also great on Amazon Prime.
B008GXHOFW|3.0|An open world Spider-Man game that is enjoyable to play. Controls need to be improved though because it's rather difficult to walk/run at times and the camera work needs improvement as well. I'd like to see sharper character designs are well because despite having a rather good looking environment, The characters look like ones you'd seen in an Nintendo 64 game.<br /><br />I do like playing it though because swinging around the city is fun and the fact that it's an open world game (not just story based but features a ton of side missions that tie into the overall plot) only adds to the replay value. I like playing it but would I say it's worth the 7 dollars to buy it? No. I luckily got it on sale for 99 cents and for that price it's a steal but I think the 7 dollar price tag is a bit excessive.<br /><br />Put out a few updates to improve the graphics and controls and then it will be worth it.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is one of the best animated movies in a long time. It's smart, funny, & able to be enjoyed by the whole family. I highly recommend it.
B0094KTBBG|2.0|You have to buy a device capable of playing HD movies.<br />You cannot play Wall-E in HD through your browser.<br /><br />Customer service is very good and allows for a prompt return
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Fantastic series, the story lines are interesting and keeps viewers wanting more. Each episode made me want to watch the next.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like this game it has games inside games has good graphics and keeps my interest I play this game all the time
0780756908|2.0|I had to return this item because I had expected it to be a hardback. I shouldn't have, I suppose, based on the price, but it wasn't clear from the description. This book (while wonderful) is much too long to read as a paperback, especially with the very small type in this book. I recommend paying for the hardback version.
B0059M7ZVG|4.0|I found these guys while wandering YouTube and they are fantastic. I need the rest of their albums. Power Metal lives.
B005544TRQ|4.0|I really liked this show, these two guys play together so good and you get to really like them. I highly recommend this show. I can't wait for the next season to come out now.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|This movie is quirky.  It has its funny moments as well as its sad.  There is a great love story. It is a must watch/buy!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Quick read. Very enjoyable. Not as scary as the shining but still fun to curl up with when it gets dark outside
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Chris Kyle was a great American hero. No doubt about it. As the title suggests, this is truly about the personal and professional life of the greatest sniper in American history. He loved his job regardless of how dangerous or how life threatening it was. He was a warrior not a writer so we should not expect a great prose or great writing from him. At least I had never expected that before starting reading his book. Still, this book is a page turner and gripping right from the beginning. He managed to do a great job on that too.<br /><br />Here are some of the things that I noticed while reading this book that might help you making your decision about reading this. The first that I noticed - sometimes it happens that he is describing a scene and about to conclude it and then he would suddenly jump to next topic leaving behind the first one incomplete. Also, he seemed to touch upon multiple things without providing much details about the different characters like fellow SEALs and the battles he fought. The characters look one dimensional. Although having read many books on SEAL warriors, it didn't trouble me a lot as I was already aware of some of the SEALs e.g. Marcus Luttrell. But if this is your first book then you may feel a little distant from the characters. Again, you are not going to get much details about SEALs training and all other details. Anyways, it depends how much you are interested in those details. A good read otherwise.
B00F91H666|3.0|the movie was okay. I read the book and I wish that they had based it on the book I loved the book It still would have had action
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book is a well written account of a great American hero. This book inspires you in many ways. It's one of the great books that you would like to recommend to anybody without any second thoughts.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|When I started this novel I was inclined to skip it because of the subject matter but I'm glad I moved forward past my own emotions.  Having lost close family and friends from this disease, I know that what they seek most is to talk about it, to have those around them acknowledge the reality of the imminent reality of their situation.  I was amazed at the sophistication and humor expressed by these very young adults in dealing with themselves and with each other.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Pretty cool I think what is going to happen is going to happen any other way around this time of day.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Fantastic characters, great score, and beautiful scenery. I would highly recommend this show to anyone who loves a period piece.
B00915G6MG|5.0|Another very strong season with excellent stories, more personal information about the characters and a real cliffhanger ending.<br />As expected, season 10 wraps up nine's ongoing story and starts a new ongoing story for season 11.<br />Harper Dearing meets his match as Gibbs closes that story line.<br />Individual episodes show us DiNozzo's apartment and introduce \\"The Admiral\\".  Both of these build the characters making them real people.<br />Another important building episode is \\"Hit and Run\\" providing a glimpse into Abby's childhood.<br />\\"Devil's Trifecta\\" is just fun as Fornell, Gibbs and their ex-wife \\"work together\\" in a personal story that touches all of them.<br />\\"Shell Shock\\" is a two-part story is well written and \\"right-on the money' looking at this problem and internal terrorists.<br />I do not want to do a spoiler and will not go into the on-going story for this season.  This is possibly the best of these stories.  This one is complex nuanced and devastating for the NCIS characters.  The acting is excellent fully showing the emotional impact of the events.  Colin Hanks brings an extra level of underhandedness to this as he pushes the NCIS team to the brink of destruction.
B0053O89JM|5.0|HUGH LAURIE &#34;OWNS&#34; THIS CHARACTER AND HIS PORTRAYAL IS  UNTOUCHABLE!!!  I WILL ORDER THE REST OF THE SEASONS DUE TO THIS ONE ACTOR!!!
B00ECLU346|4.0|I liked it and I will watch it again.  It filled in missing pieces to a story already in play and left the door open for sequel which I would watch as well.  For whatever reason, I thought this movie worked.  Can't tell you why.  It just did.
B00F35BV64|5.0|I like these kind of movies , action packed and got right to the action in the beginning. I would rent it again.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved it. And would love to see more.  Sorry, but demanding more words is irritating. I will never take the trouble.to do this again.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I like these kind of movies , action packed and got right to the action in the beginning. I would rent it again.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator app is an excellent tool. It is simple to use and has what is needed for a calculator app. Great for all users.
B00BDAP66E|5.0|Love it. Program is so bennificle and really helps. Easy to use walks right thru<br />Anybody that has a business Facebook page should have this
B009U9S6FI|4.0|What an amazing individual and thinker Frankl is.  A real gem in considering how people react when faced by the worst and most depraved humanity can face.<br />Appreciate a perspective that is less about what was experienced and more about how we ract to our world and what is happening around us.  Well worth considering how we would react.
0345803507|5.0|This is a must read book !!!!!...buy all three books at the same time. You will regret it if you don't.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This was an interesting read. Sad,moving,and real. All the more  fun to read because it takes place in a neighborhood I am familiar with from my youth. I to believe in silver lining s.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|I lost many a nights sleep because of this book.  When I was nearing the end of the book one night,<br />it was probably 2:20 a.m. and I sat straight up and said &#34;Oh nooooo!!&#34;  And then I cried for the rest of<br />the night.  Jodi Picoult brings her characters to life in such a way, you feel like these are real people<br />your learning to love - and then you do love them.  It is very rare that a book catches me off guard the<br />way this one did.  It is an excellent read.  Full of courageous people - with tears and humor mix.  I loved<br />it. Will definitely read more of Ms Picoult's books.
B002X6PTH8|5.0|Jim Carey was at its best in this movie!  We always enjoy watching movies like this during the weekend. Highly recommended!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Handy when shopping, trying to keep within the budget.  Helps with figuring material lists for home projects.  Good tip calculator.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|The spirit of this book kept me interested.  I read it from cover to cover...in one day. Thanks for the affirmation.
B0039Q7QKE|5.0|Ordered this for my boss for Christmas. It's in a plastic packaging for the new movies. But the pin looks nice. Sturdy. I now want one for myself! Would buy again.
B007QUUJMG|5.0|This book is great! I definitely recommend it! Would give it a million stars if I could! :) C: Perfect
B003VANOFY|5.0|Bought these for my fiance after he went through two pairs of turtle beach headphones(they broke and they replaced them under warranty, and they broke again). He LOVES these headphones. They also have a silly voice changing program that he likes to play with at LAN parties. They fit nice.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Fantastic series! You will love the characters and the ever changing story lines. There are 4 more seasons to watch too!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is the best android keyboard I've used. Wins with accurate typing and great gesture typing. Quite a strong auto correct system in place too.
B000IZ4R1U|5.0|ANGIE IS SO DEDICATED TO HER ART AS AN ACTOR AND DOES A FABULOUS JOB OF SHOWING US A VERY AGGRESSIVE FEMALE IN A LEADING ROLE.  SHE CAN SHOW HER TOUGH SIDE AND VULNERABLE SIDE AT THE SAME TIME.<br />THIS IS ACTION PACKED, FAST MOVING AND SHOWS US A GREAT TALENT.<br />THE STORY LINE WAS INCREDIBLE AND BELIEVABLE, IF ONE LET'S GO AND BELIEVES IN A THRILLER-SI-FI FILM.<br />GERARD BUTLER IS SO GORGEOUS AND PLAYS HIS PART IN THIS FILM VERY WELL...THIS IS A MUST SEE.
B00BB8VRPM|2.0|Oh wait!  I did watch this free movie stream and my husband and I did not watch it beyond the first 3 minutes.  We didn't realize it was spoken in Italian and dubbed in English and that's the last thing I want to do is &#34;read&#34; my way through a movie.  The description should have told us this.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|the first book made me wonder about the why, what , where and how; this second book validates a lost childhood and a misguided adolescence - I am glad that Christian grey had a good sense of survival and had the good instinct to protect his relationship with Anastasia.  a very well thought out plot.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|great play. takes too long to earn green money, though. the graphics are pretty good but the touch system could use a little tweaking. trying to touch a tree and end up collecting a house is a little annoying.
B00DJ80VLS|1.0|DT was my favorite band. I never dreamed I would rate one of their albums as one star. The majority of this album sounds like limp wristed pop metal and a bunch of recycled riffs and sounds. The song lyrics do nothing for me. Mangini or Portnoy at drums-it makes no difference to me, but it is becoming painfully obvious that Portnoy was the song writer for this band. I hope they are able to turn it around next time, otherwise the next album should be titiled \\"Dream Theater: Descent into mediocrity\\".
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I have watched all four seasons and hope for the fifth soon to be released.  The characters are believable and charming.  The costumes are lovely and the stories are enchanting.  Relax and enjoy some wholesome entertainment.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Edge of your seat storytelling, fascinating characters, and plenty of emotional melodrama take this series way beyond your typical tv show. This season goes deeper and more raw than ever.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|The bad reviews had me doubtful but once I actually started reading I was sucked in right away.  I blew through all five books in a week. As much as I hate to wait for the sixth it's worth it to know it's not over ;)
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Once you get into the book it is good I had trouble in the beginning I like a story that gets you when you start to read for me this book did not due that
B0011Z76RS|5.0|Okay... I admit it. I've heard the album prior to purchasing it and have had the honor of seeing Linkin Park in concert here in the Chicago, IL area. I am a fan, and I'm proud of it. This has got to be one of their greatest albums put together, if not THE BEST. :-)
B0089LOG02|4.0|It is disturbing to hear how badly our foster system is working. I feel very sorry for children that get caught up in this system.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|I initially read this book from my local library, and was excited to see it became a movie as well. I luv'd the book and thought it was well-written. The movie, while it does have some minor differences, is quite true to the book and equally well done. I think it brings up a great perspective from the deep south, one perhaps many people haven't considered...
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I liked this book because it was true. The book portrayed our criminal system in all it's screwed up fallacies.
B000G1ALRK|5.0|I love this album. Sinners Like Me is one of my favorite songs but the entire album is great! I wish more of the songs had been released to radio. It's real country music!
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I chose this book because I thought it would be interesting. I thnk the husband shold have revealed what he did before he got married.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|I'm hooked!! It started slow the first few episodes but once I took the time to watch the entire episode without interruption, I found myself watching episode after episode night after night.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I am loving this game. cant stop playing it. Downloaded. it for my daughter but it has become my game now
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|I have read stories and seen movies of Cinderella but non have equaled this one.  The characters fit the parts so well.  Drew Barrymore is just superb and the prince is so lovable.  Angelica Houston is great as the step mother.  Excellent<br /> all around flick.<br /><br />I can't tell you how many times I viewed this film...and will continue to do so.  Just magnificent.
B005NFVZTM|3.0|Too much CGI and not enough practical effects. The acting and method were good, I just couldn't get into a movie that looked so computer generated.
B003Y5H5FG|5.0|I hate remakes just as much as the next person because they rarely do the original film justice, but from reading the reviews about this one in particular, I'd say people need to lighten up.<br /><br />The original is, for some people, one of the greatest horror flicks of the 80s, so the remake was up against some stiff competition. I personally have never seen the original, so I can't say. However, I enjoyed this rendition & felt it lived up to its expectations as a modern day chiller. It was suspenseful, hilarious at times, & tastefully done. I think all of the actors did a pretty good job in their portrayals. David Tennant (Dr. Who) was a pleasure to watch. And Colin Farrell was as well, for obvious reasons. I thought he was a fantastic vampire. Menacing, self-involved, & pure evil such as they are in historical works of fiction. Real vampires don't sparkle...<br /><br />I think that the main problem fans of the original have is that there wasn't quite enough gore. Get over it. I don't think it's written anywhere that a movie requires carnage & gore to be thrilling. Bottom-line, if you're a fan of vampire flicks like I am, give this one a try & don't be so stuffy about it if you've seen the original. From what I understand, they're worlds apart & cant be compared anyway. And besides that, no remake will ever be exactly like the original. That's the point of remaking it. To re-imagine it....
B00F91SCXC|5.0|Unlike most recent movies World War Z gets straight into the action (5-10 minutes in), holds your attention for the entire length of the film, and possesses both impressive digital effects and a well thought out plot.  This film doesn't spend the first 45 minutes introducing you to the characters or slowly building up to the climax, it won't leave you checking the time halfway through, and it doesn't have to use special effects in an effort to make you overlook the complete lack of a comprehendible story line/plot, making it one of the few recently produced movies worth seeing.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Amazing show! I started watching it and I cant seem to pull out of it. So glad Amazon has it
B00DI75SWM|5.0|Great, great app, keep calm generator! It gets a little hard to think of some at times, but otherwise it's a great time waister!! I got this app because I've been seeing these keep calm posters everywhere. I just thought you could change what the text said! This app does so much more!<br />Amazing app totally recommended
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Getting the characters straight at the beginning was a bit of a challenge. But then they &#34;fell into place&#34; and an interesting story unfolded.  Really enjoyed the tale!
B006FK7SZ4|5.0|Great for meating pepole and an chating ivwould say try it you will lime plus apples in space with whales
B00B4FU6KE|4.0|A friend recommended this book without telling me what it was about.  I'm glad she didn't.  It made reading it a real surprise.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|(: Awesome game. It's extremely fun. It's really addictive. Get it if you want to kill time!!! Looks great on the big screen.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The author has taken the myriad strands of many lives and woven them together in a rich and colorful tapestry.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|Great graphics and playability.  Easy to sign in with facebook.  Fun achievements and pool cues to earn!  Download this game  if you love pool.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I could personally relate to this story as I too have hiked a good portion of the Pacific Crest Trail. My motive for undertaking this test was much different than the author's, but once on the trail the issues one faces are the same, e.g., physical obstacles like snow, lack of water, logistics, physical ailments, loneliness, doubt, etc.  I experienced all those things, yet would undertake it again and again if able.  Cheryl Strayed has the talent to tell the story in a compelling way that drives it forward and makes the reader one with her.  Heartily recommend this book.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Couldn't stop watching once I started!  Great cast.  Quirky and fun.  Love the John Noble character.  Overall fun if you can suspend disbelief for a while.
B00F91SCXC|2.0|Predictable story and poor animation on zombies especially made for a pretty poor recreation of a great book. Not the greatest Brad Pitt movie by far.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Lifelong bonds based in love can transcend tremendous amounts of pain, suffering, heartbreak, and loss. This was an amazing account of life in Afghanistan which brings understanding to those of us whose only knowledge comes from the media. Additionally a poignant story is told that anyone who has a heart can relate to.
0811879542|5.0|Honestly, I have no idea why both my kids (ages 5 and 3) LOVE this book.....but they do.  If it is within eye sight come bedtime, they are both asking for me to read it.  It still amazes me that they are just as excited reading the book the 100th time as they were the first???  If it works for them it works for me!
B00BWJARHO|4.0|I enjoyed it to mostly the end but then fell asleep.... It was long and dragged out but with an interesting story line. I will perhaps rent it again when I am rested to give it a real shot!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|What I love about this movie is the twists and turns you never see coming. It also has the benefit of being a one of a kind movie, unlike any other movie I have ever seen. Two thumbs up from me!
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|I felt like I was in the movie with the characters... Excellent movie! I felt all sorts of emotions!!! It was awesome!!
B009CGLO3K|5.0|Charlize and Kristen nailed their performances in this unique twist to an old tale. Very well done and the storyline is edge of your seat riveting. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who loves medieval time pieces!
B00CS74W0C|5.0|love Gideon Cross!!!  hoping the next book will arrive soon!!!! Can't wait to see what's next with eva and gideon &#60;3
B0020M99LC|5.0|007 is back and as good as ever! Daniel Craig makes a stunning James Bond, visually and as an actor. This movie is exactly the kind of James Bond movie one would come to expect from the family that creates them. Wonderfully done and a great cast!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Very fun game, great relay value and challenge to do better. Progression is a ton of fun as well, using the different sharks.
B00EM6LRCS|3.0|Whomever got their hands on this script had the potential of making a truly great movie. The actors did the best they could and the storyline is a good one. The director just failed to make it all it could be. This is definitely a rental type movie and not a purchase.
B007AL48UK|5.0|Had a good time playing this game. I like a game I can win occassuonly.<br />It is a nice change from Solitaite.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Wow! A zombie movie that I like! Almost unfathomable. It has everything you could ask for in a movie: love, compassion, action, sadness and a few laughs. I absolutely adore this movie!
B005723JSQ|4.0|Sophie Kinsella books are always funny and lighthearted.  A nice way to read something in between heavy or very dramatic books. The footnotes were cute for the first chapter, but could have done without them for the entire book.
B009UZBLSG|5.0|I am editing my initial review...I purchased my slimport adapter in July 2013 for 29$ from amazon via demandport vendor...at 29$ it was a good proposition, but at current 100$ plus, this is not a recommendable proposition. Other vendors and options below 30$ are available. I just ordered a star-tech slmprt2hd for backup unit. As soon as I receive it I will make a review......<br /><br />Original post:<br /><br />I purchased this SlimPort adapter from Amazon to be used on my new Nexus 7 2nd gen. As soon as I got new Nexus at home, I first tested it and works beautifully projecting (mirroring) my Nexus 7 screen on my 58\\" TV.<br /><br />For the Nexus 7 1st gen fans, they knew that one of the major shortcomings of the first gen tablet was the lack of any video out methods (easy, that is), as first gen did not offer MHL, slimport or anything else.<br /><br />Conclusion: If you own a New Nexus 7 (2nd gen), this adapter is a must...<br /><br />Before other users ask...: Chromecast is fantastic (I have it too), but it projects youtube, Netflix or other similar apps onto your tv, but it does not mirror your screen, so if you want to mirror, get this SlimPort adapter.

B007TNS6JI|5.0|Dungeon hunter 3 is amazing you can play in multiplayer and single and they are both amazing! I can't find anything wrong this game it is really just a good game.
B009X01C64|2.0|It is a bit bulky but makes that feels like it is protecting the kindle. The rotate feature that allows the Kindle to be supported either landscape or portrait and to allow it to open correctly as if a book is great and the auto-sleep/wake magnet works perfectly. However after a few weeks I started to notice thick stain lines on my screen that would not wipe off no matter what I used to clean it and I had to remove and repurchase a new screen protector. I'd be concerned it might stain the glass is the screen protector was not in use. I would recommend keeping a protective cloth over the screen when using this case. I wish I would have saved the one that the Kindle was shipped with. It was incredibly difficult to remove the Kindle from the case and the case was damaged in the process. I paid much less than the recurring listed price of $54.99 and feel that even at half that this is far overpriced for the problems I've had with the case.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great app,very fun,you can create anything u want to and u can survival of the land you should get this app
0805047905|5.0|My daughters (ages 3 and 6) love this book. It is a very simple rhyming book that emphasizes colors.  Every page basically rhymes \\"see\\" and \\"me\\" with different animal and color combinations.  The artwork is also unique, but great.  My 3 year old has been choosing it pretty often lately as her bedtime story and she loves to flip through it on her own.  Overall, the book is great for your young toddlers or beginning readers.  My 6 year old wanted to read it to my 3 year old the other night which we always love to see.  Recommended!
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|It's a great racing app for kids who love  race car games and it has awesome music that plays in racing
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I like the convince of finishing one book in a series and within seconds having the next one delivered to my device.<br /><br />I can even read on my phone during those times I am waiting with nothing else to do.<br /><br />I enjoy the app very much.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Should have red stone but great game!!! Another great game is mmorpg project. It's a fighting rpg open world mutliplayer and the funnest game on the appstore. It would be greatly appreciated and a much better of a game if more people had got it. So go get it!!!!! And PS- when it asks you for a referrer or secret extra token code, enter AfricanPygmy and 50 free VIP tokens awaits you!!!
B001NLKXK2|4.0|An interesting look at loss and grief, with a fai treatment of each character's perspective. To say I enjoyed the book isn't as true as I learned from it, connected with it, and I highly recommend it to those who like to feel that reading should give us something to take away.
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|They should create a game like grand theft auto 5 but batter like gangster Jersey Thanks for voting on this view
B000PMG16U|5.0|Big Star Wars fan. Nice buying all 3 films in 1 package each on blue ray. Quality excellent. Worth price.
B0081336FO|5.0|Amazing! Both actors are of such high quality and the writing is masterful. Fully recommend watching this show! Can't wait for the next season.
B005ZC0SYQ|5.0|This movie has always been one of my favorites. Even after all these years, it still stands out as an amazing story. Moving. Awesome... and I wish they made more movies with a soul like this one.
B00364K6YW|5.0|The quality was great!  This is one of my favorite of hers.  Colin Firth is one of my favorite actors.  My daughters gave me gift certificates for Amazon and this was a great way to use them.
B005NS0VNU|5.0|The headline says it all. The collection includes tons of famous R.E.M. songs and also some less popular ones that are also great.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  I have every Jane Eyre movie dating back to 1930's with Orson Welles.  I think this is the best one yet.  I tried to copy the Masterpiece Version and couldn't find a tape that would record it all.  I'm so glad that I couldn't, having the whole series on one disc is great.  The quality was perfect. I love it.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|This season was amazing! Couldn't stop watching! I truly admire the stronger Alicia . can't wait for Season 5.. Tonight!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|I don't normally purchase movies, but I will in this case because the movie is so exciting and mind puzzling. Just when you think you have solved the mystery, you find another one waiting...loved the movie.
B000U0O9FM|5.0|I got a kindle and found this book on there. I had seen the movie when I was younger. The book is exceptional! I haven't read a full book in a long time. I couldn't put this down. I can't wait to read more of Mr. Palahniuk's work!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was an interesting  read even though very sad.  It's a book that is difficult to put down because you want to know the end even though you dread it. A good book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love it so much I read them three times. I probably will read them again. I can't wait for the movie.
0385743564|3.0|Sanderson's work is usually characterized by two things: 1) setting up an interesting world, and 2) providing the protagonist with an challenging puzzle to solve that provides an unexpected resolution at the very end.<br /><br />In this book, Sanderson fails at number 2. I was pretty sure from the very beginning what Steelheart's weakness was, so it wasn't a surprise to find out. How David chose to exploit it WAS unexpected and wasn't remotely plausible, so there wasn't any satisfaction from it. In fact, Sanderson strikes me in being a bit sloppy in not making the denouement more believable. Perhaps he's spread himself a bit thin attempting too many books over a short time span. And yeah, David's character flaw of bad metaphors looks rather contrived and not endearing at all, again which suggests a lack of attention to detail for the book.
B00881VLCE|2.0|When asked to update my puzzle program I accepted. I am NOT happy with this new format. Pieces are hard to get. I don't always get what I aim for. It is slow. I really wish I could go back to what I had before.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really like this app it helps with knowing exactly when your battery needs charging and how much life and time left for the functions with the record of charges this is a good free app
B007IXWKUK|5.0|EL James has the ability to keep me so intrigued that I have no desire to put the book down...rarely does that happen.  Although, in the first book I was so drawn in to the story line I really didn't expect that to happen with this book.  Thank you so much for the delightful surprise.  Looking forward to reading the third one!
B00BP29SAA|5.0|For preschoolers you can't beat the Dr. Panda games and this is no exception lots of fun and intuitive things to do.
B009A87Z6U|3.0|I'm a Sean Connery fan from the get go when it comes to James Bond. Daniel Craig does a fair job. Much better than Roger Moore, but not, in my opinion as good as Connery or Pierce Brosnon. I really bought this so I'd have all 23 of the James Bond Movies.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I couldn't put it down!  It grabs you from the first chapter and keeps you reading until the last sentence.
B009A87ZQU|3.0|I'm a Sean Connery fan from the get go when it comes to James Bond. Daniel Craig does a fair job. Much better than Roger Moore, but not, in my opinion as good as Connery or Pierce Brosnon. I really bought this so I'd have all 23 of the James Bond Movies.
B001XUYA0W|4.0|Suspenseful and well played.  Reminds me more of an Alfred Hitchcock who done it.  I'm not a Sean Penn fan but enjoyed his acting in his role as a devastated father.
B00DK9FNLY|1.0|I didn't keep it long enough to see the ad problem others have mentioned. The game is terrible. It is buggy, it's almost impossible to serve, the sounds are annoying and you have little control of what you're doing. I uninstalled within minutes.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app has been wonderful to use, its ease of use, set up and handling for a non-tech person is invaluable.
B00FEHXCIG|1.0|A waist of money. I'm happy I rented this boring, awful, movie instead of buying it. Don't waist your hard earned money on this total garbage. I almost turned it off a few times but I kept thinking it's got to get better but never did. Although the Blu-Ray disc might make a good beer coaster. This is such a mono tone piece of crap, blah, blah, blah.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I can't pull my 7 year old off this game.  We used this as an incentive reward to do his homework in a timely manner.  It has worked well beyond expectations.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|I remember some of these episodes from childhood.  What a great series to sit back, relax, and watch a clean drama/suspense show.  Sure some of the plots are far fetched with a few holes but you just might learn something by watching; I always carry extra chocolate bars in the event I come across an acid leak, now.  If you want to watch this genera of show with out overdone explosions, excessive CGI, and complicated hard to follow plots this may just be your show to chill.
B009FXIICK|2.0|First, this was the faotd in November of last year, so lets call it a rerun.  The problem with refund is that if you didn't like them the first time, the second time doesn't get any better.  Disappointment X 2.
B003G4W49C|4.0|This book is well written. I've never been personally any good at strategy, so it was really nice to read this and gain insight to the world of pawns and manipulation.  This book has affected the way I look at humanity and the world. I'm grateful to have read it and recommend it to anyone.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Enjoyed learning about the lives of some very different families then later how they were brought together. Some interesting twists!
B001K3EXTA|4.0|Great movie.<br />I will admit that amazon is a little annoying with all these reviews that I have to write all the time.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Fun and not to hard to handle.  Love all the different armies available.  I want to collect them all.  Slot like the movie.
B006PFC2S2|5.0|I love this movies. I always have, Romance, Singing, what more could I ask for? I would watch it over and over... I actually have!
B005V20JKI|1.0|I got the game a long time ago when it was a paid game.  Now it is free with IAP and even though I paid for the game previously now it is trying to get me to pay inside the game for something I already paid for and was able to previously play.<br /><br />Complete joke, going to uninstall this game and even delete it from my Amazon app library. Complete scam this dev should be forced to refund anyone who previously paid for the game and removed from amazon app store.<br /><br />In short, stay away unless you want to end up being scammed by the dev.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Probably the greatest diet/self help book ever written.  A little more scientific support for the paleo/ wheat belly/ gluten free lifestyle than wheat belly and the paleo solution but it also makes it a deeper read.  Numerous peer review studies from 2010  forward that were probably not available in the other books.<br /><br />If you eat wheat, you're hurting yourself and increasing the likelihood that you will develop diabetes, obesity, dementia, Alzheimer's, and a whole host of other debilitating ailments.<br /><br />Buy the book , lose the Wheat.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|My son is six and he loves angry birds.  He could play this for hours if I let him.  He's always trying to show me the cool birds and their powers.  Awesome game!
B001NLKZUA|4.0|Love love love this series. This book though was really really really really sad. ;.( I hope the next on  is not.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|If you are a Phantom of the Opera fan, you will truly enjoy this DVD.  Go ahead, order it!  :-)
B00594XOZU|3.0|My kik is bein aggravating because it wont let me login<br />Its okay because before my mom messed everything up it was awesonw
B000P12LWY|5.0|excellent condition
B00B7Y0206|2.0|I love it because I can quickly get on to something without having to power up the desktop.I can show things to others even when no in my home.
B00BKTFABE|1.0|When I purchased my Kindle Fire HD I thought it was a front and back facing camera/video camera.  I was VERY disappointed that it is only front facing.  How can I take a picture or do a recording when I can't see what I am aiming at?????
B004SUWR2C|5.0|Love it. It also as aggravating as the card game. Like the color.it kept this 66 year old brain alive and kicking.<br />Sandinolan@cox
B00F35B8F8|5.0|It's Star Trek for a new age.  The actors are fun and fitting, and the plot clips along to a great pace.  While a little less action might help to add some depth, Star Trek never really was all that deep.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So addictive I love this GAME!!!!!! Best online game I've EVER played me and my daughters sit and play for hours
B00BRUPICM|5.0|I read this in one sitting. I wanted to see how it would conclude, and it did not disappoint.<br /><br />This is the first title in a trilogy, I can't wait for the second one!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Whatever I look for I found  on Google!! It is the best search engine!!<br />I can find out all sorts of things!!
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|Definitely a page turner and one that takes you around the world. Well written and well researched with strong characters.
B00594XOZU|1.0|Ever since today i haven't been able to log on with my kindle fire!! Maybe you should get an upgrade just like the app for smartphones for!!
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Bought this after watching and enjoying Avengers. This provides a nice little back story and rounds out Thor's character a bit. It was a fun, energetic romp that my entire family enjoyed.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging and misleading . Very entertaining. Nice work! I would really love to have the opportunity of unlock more levels and enjoy this particular game. Thank you.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I totally enjoyed this movie, as I am a fan of the original. (Spoiler alert) It seems they put several of the previous movies into this one, which seeing how things were changed due to the first movie was plausible.  You will not be disappointed with this movie if you are a Star Trek fan.
B0044XV3R8|4.0|Watched part of the movie in a motel on a trip. Really liked it. So brought this set so we could watch the beginning of the movie. Great graphics.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Great suspense. Great drama.  Wonderful cast.  The writing was superb as were both the directors.<br />The scenery was stunning.  Finding out who the killer is is just the beginning of the drama.  David Tennant<br />played his role with such restraint giving way to Olivia Coleman's amazing drama.  One does not just weep..you<br />cannot help but sob...thank you all.  Great to see all the Doctor Who connections, but also to meet so many different great actors.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Some one recommended this show to us and watched some on TV. Really enjoyed them so started collecting the series. If you liked &#34;Fire Fly&#34; you'll be able to catch a lot of references to that show.
B00DH1G7DS|3.0|Nothing special not bad I have seen better will keep you occupied it is ok but not great for now
B00C5R8364|5.0|As usual, Mr Forysth produces another winner. Taut, good detail and interesting characters make it a &#34;cannot put down&#34; book
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I think Chris was a genuine person and one hell of a dedicated soldier.  I would loved to have the honor of meeting him.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I got this little device for my girlfriend. Really simple to use. Just plug it into your TV and control Netflix, etc, with your laptop or tablet. Cheaper, smaller, and more convenient than a Roku or other digital TV device.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|One of the best series ever done. I love the attention to detail, the costumes, the casting, the writing, everything about it.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|This is an excellent series. Very good plot with very good actors. Fun seeing two from Dr. Who in totally different roles.
B00821OX98|4.0|I personally prefer shows that are based on the present, but feel in the genre of apocalyptic alien invaders, I think this show is well written and acted. I watched all the seasons available on Amazon Prime, in marathon fashion. I am eagerly waiting the next.
B003FC1752|5.0|I like Josh Lucas and Kurt Russell, so their tandem was most entertaining.  It's a good watch for a Saturday evening.
B00DHQHAH0|5.0|Great show can't wait for the next season on Amazon. Totally different concept for a comedy drama. You don't see what's coming next.
B00F91H15W|2.0|This movie seemed to lack any real semblance to the real story.  The story may have been real but this movie was completely unbelievable.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I stated out good, the game was fun, but it got confusing, not sure if it was me or the game, sure don't want to bet the farm on that one.But it was fun, maybe this coming winter when its easier to stay in I will down load it again.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This device will NOT work on a 5G and 5G has been a standard for years!  Why would they bring out a device that can't work on an industry standard 5G network....  A bummer!
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I was a little hesitant buying this book ,but glad I did. Great characters and good story. Looking forward to more by John Scalzi.
B00F91H666|4.0|I never like zombie movies because they are impossible to believe.  The argument that someone dead all of a sudden becomes alive is silly.  However, in this movie, an infection similar to rabies that spread when infected individuals bite other people is more believable.  Adding well known organizations to the drama such as the World Health Organization also is a plus.<br />I would recommend this movie as the best one so far of its kind.
B00BB8VSXS|5.0|One of the all time best movies that I have ever seen. This with touch your heart and truely dhow you the power of the human spirit, during such a dark time in our history!
B00ECR7KX2|5.0|We loved this film! We are huge Whedon fans, it was so much fun to see people pulled from various Whedon productions.<br />Much Ado About Nothing is one of my favorite Shakespeare works; it was awesome to see Whedon's take on it.<br />The humor is fun, the language the same, and the cast is superb.<br /><br />This is one that we will buy and re-watch.
B001MW0J2O|2.0|I purchased \\"Merriweather Post Pavilion\\" after it was recommended to me by Amazon given prior purchases. Appreciating the enormous praise left by reviewers, I decided to take the plunge. Indeed, it has some of the most beautiful packaging that I've ever seen with a CD. When it comes to the music, I just don't get it. After listening to this Animal Collective disc dozens of times, it doesn't sound any better. It's as if every song is the introduction to a tune that never actually begins. The song writing is weak. The psychedelic soundscape is very well done but this experience is lacking the most important element that makes music compelling. Clearly most people seem to adore \\"Merriweather Post Pavilion\\" but it's hard for me to imagine why.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|not very good, movie drags on, does not capture the viewers attention. The script needed to be redone to bring the movie to life.
B002S45V32|5.0|Watched this with my wife and kids, and we all loved it. Great story with fantastic cast and great soundtrack.
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|It's pretty amazing,I've played lots of hidden quest,adventure,puzzle games(and payed a lot more) it's kind of tricky and sometimes confusing. But it's kept me captivated fir weeks. It's not to easy or hard. Have fun and let's hope there's a sequel!!
B008Y6WMEY|4.0|Classic funny movie.  Peter Sellers is excellent in three roles.  George C. Scott is excellent too and funny.  Was this role why they thought of him for Patton?
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show balances sharp dialogue, comedy and drama and has the sophistication of movies that were last scene in Cary Grant movies in the sixties. The most underrated show on TV.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|First two books really kept my interest.  I had a hard time reading this book.  I jumped around to much.
B004YXE438|4.0|This app is great. The puzzles are striking and colorful, with plenty of levels to play and replay to beat your score. Highly recommend!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Don't plan on reading this if you have anything else to do. Stephen King's books are my literature equivalent of comfort food. Good, solid fare, with many beloved dishes, rarely gourmet, but always immensely satisfying. And &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34; is Stephen King at his best!  Not only is it a terrific sequel, it is also one of the best novels I have ever read dealing with the topic of alcoholism and addiction.<br />Whether or not you are a King fan, run, don't walk to your nearest bookstore and treat yourself!
B001AQQR2S|5.0|my kids love this movie, we found it very entertaining too ourselves, it's funny and it had a great story line. I'm giving it a 5 stars as my kids ask to see it over and over again...
B007EECSFA|5.0|A beautifully written book - it has all the qualities to make a good movie! I will certainly look for more of this author's books.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|It Was Difficult At First To Get Into, But soon Became The Book I Was Looking Forward To.  The new Characters Were Hard To Follow.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|Better instructions would be nice, the plane is especially frustrating.  But it's a fun game, and I keep coming back
B00B4FU6KE|4.0|Unexpected twists and turns become expected in this story.  It is an intriguing story and has an agenda.  Can't say much else so as not to spoil suprises.
0802798225|5.0|I love this book, I think this book is so cute and it is worth reading and buying. I totally recommend this book to any teenager ,It is so cute and romantic. Also, I like the bad boy and perfect girl book. Perfect Chemistry is a good book ,that's all I can say!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I wanted this for my kindle and it was free.  Works just like a calculator.  Wow not much more to say
B002N44XSG|4.0|Nice companion to the series. It's similar to bonus material on a dvd. A bit pricey but if you have rabid Riordan fans in the house you're not going to get away with not having this.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Especially well written story.<br />Three unique women's stories each snag your interest.  I was so interested in all of them.  Amazing how the auther tied in small details from each to the other stories.  Long before they were showing braided together you got glimpses of how theit lives has intersected at different times.  Plan to finish this book in a weekend, there is no way to put it down once you start.
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|I am not familiar with the comics, but everything I've read from fans of the story are pretty much spot-on. Tom Cruise was a poor casting choice. It isn't that he's not a good actor, it is just that he doesn't fit the part. The character is cool, but the script wasn't so good.
B00EY7MFKS|5.0|So far I am very much enjoying this series.  Very glad to see a tv series in the marvel universe that isn't all about the super heros.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love and hate Christian Grey! Bring on Darker and Freed! This book keeps you wanting more! Idk how they're making a movie?
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Great game for every one young and old boy or girl who is looking to wage war on the world
B002A9THA8|5.0|It had been many years since I watched Flashdance. I remembered that it was good, but not this good. Could be my age, but the music was wonderful! Would recommend for anyone, even if you have already seen it.
B00AYB0YFQ|1.0|Probably the worst movie I've ever seen!  I would not recommend this movie to anyone.  I would not even call it slapstick, it was just awful.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Stunning visual scenes.  Pretty good story line.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars, the movement controls are a bit sloppy.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|I found this series right up with the excitement of The Hunger Games. I would highly recommend this for anyone who likes adventure, surprises and love that conquers tyranny.
B003JTHWJQ|3.0|Certainly interesting for inquiring minds.  Always good to learn other observations of other people in the world.  It's a good read.
B001R10BEG|4.0|I've been a fan of Tom Hanks ever since I saw Big, and I would say that it's the first Hanks performance that really made me aware that he could be more than someone who would only be remembered as a briefly popular comedic actor. Big is a comedy, but it contains plenty of scenes which rely on drama. It makes some good observations about childhood, friendship, relationships, and life itself.<br /><br />Josh Baskin (Hanks) is 12, and has a crush on someone at school. Unfortunately, he has no chance because her boyfriend can drive. After a failed attempt to sit next to her on a fairground ride, Josh makes a wish on a Zoltar machine; he wants to be big. A card informs him that his wish has been granted, and he wakes up the next morning as an adult. While that sounds like utter nonsense, it provides an opportunity to show how a child in a man's body might interact with the world.<br /><br />We see Josh convince his friend, Billy (Jared Rushton), that he really is who he says he is. The two form a plan to track down a Zoltar machine so that Josh can wish to return to normal. While the pair wait for the information to arrive, Josh has to support himself. He likes computer games and manages to talk his way into working as a data processor at a toy company. I guess finding a job was easier in 1988 than it is today?<br /><br />The genius of the movie is in showing us how simple life can be when you're a child. Most adults become jaded when they realize the reality of working, the daily routine, and the struggle to pay for all the little luxuries that they covet. Josh attacks the world with the exuberance of a child. He does everything quickly and to the best of his ability, and his enthusiastic approach draws the attention of the Mr. MacMillan (Robert Loggia), who owns the company.<br /><br />Josh is promoted fast, and is soon vice president of development. His apparent luck causes resentment among some of the employees, but Susan (Elizabeth Perkins) finds his approach attractive. The two enter into a relationship, but we can see that Josh doesn't have any idea how to behave around a woman who isn't his mother. Once again, his honest approach pays dividends, and Susan perceives his attitude as a refreshing change from the manipulative partner she last dated. In fact, his childish notions help unlock the child inside her, and she likes the feelings it evokes in her.<br /><br />The movie is definitely a feel-good piece, but it's more than just fluff. If you think about some of the messages, it's telling us just to take things at face value and enjoy life. Josh succeeds because he has no ulterior motives. We are regularly reminded about the importance of friendship, and how events in our lives can sometimes threaten our relationships with established friends when we find something or someone new that we think deserves our full attention. Of course, a good friend will forgive you for such indulgences.<br /><br />There have been so many movies about identity switches, and quite a few of them were made in the 80s. Big is better than all of the others because after the initial fantasy element, it contains a lot of incisive observations about human behavior. The casting elevates the movie to yet another level, and it's one I return to every couple of years.<br /><br />The story was written by Gary Ross, who had a hand in the writing of Seabiscuit, Pleasantville, and The Hunger Games. This is easily his best early effort and it deserves your time. The Blu-ray includes an extended cut, which adds 26 minutes to the movie, and it's my preferred version.ctive.

Of course, a good friend will forgive you for such indulgences.<br /><br />There have been so many movies about identity switches, and quite a few of them were made in the 80s. Big is better than all of the others because after the initial fantasy element, it contains a lot of incisive observations about human behavior. The casting elevates the movie to yet another level, and it's one I return to every couple of years.<br /><br />The story was written by Gary Ross, who had a hand in the writing of Seabiscuit, Pleasantville, and The Hunger Games. This is easily his best early effort and it deserves your time. The Blu-ray includes an extended cut, which adds 26 minutes to the movie, and it's my preferred version.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I didn't know what to think at first. But this proves that Brandon Sanderson is an incredible writer. I'm looking forward to the next
B00BHNQ5XK|1.0|When a movie is half in the dark, it usually means it is a stinker.  Please don't waste your time.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is a great bingo game easy to use with friendly people playing. User friendly game and great graphics.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Watched the movie first.  Book as always is much better<br />Will be reading the rest as soon as I can.
B00ESH04LQ|5.0|Short version, this is a B&W film in modern setting, preserving the original language. Long version- This movie was the most romantic film I've ever seen! Joss Whedon uses his 'house actors' to craft a thoroughly enjoyable movie. If you were a fan of Buffy, Angel, and Firefly, you'll be excited to see familiar actors placed in perfectly chosen rolls. Amy Acker and Alexis Denisof shine as the romantic leads, Beatrice and Benedick and the casting of Riki Lindhome as as a female Claudio was a delightful twist that redefined the character's motives. I've seen this play preformed live twice, but this movie version really made the tale come alive for me, as the cast seemed to have real chemistry. I'm buying this when it comes out on DVD.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|My husband & I have gotten hooked on this series after a family member told us about it.  We missed Seasons 1 & 2 and bought them and have been watching to try to catch up before Season 3 has come & gone!!<br /><br />We really like it because they don't show a lot of blood and guts and no explicit sex or a lot of innuendo.  We are hoping they will keep it this way.  It's also very intriguing how they are using the storybook characters so you know who they are but their stories are not always the same as we read when we were young.<br /><br />Great series!  We hope it continues and they can keep it clean and intriguing!!
B00BLH1KJQ|1.0|Strange does not begin to do this movie justice.  I found almost no entertainement in this.  Don't waste your time.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|This show is the bomb dot com. Quote possibly the best show I have ever seen. My roommates agree. We might like it more than entourage.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|VERY EXCITING...BRAD PITT WONDERFUL ACTOR.....EXCITING,SCARY MOVIE.....ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH....LIKE THE CO STARS AS WELL..DID NOT REALIZE HE COULD ACT...I THOUGHT HE WAS JUST A GORGEOUS MAN TO LOOK AT....<br />JOYCE LYNN

B003MC5L9S|5.0|This is a very simple book to have on hand as a reference. I'm not much of a reader but its interesting if you can stay focused on its teachings. My mind wanders and I lose interest easily unless its Sci-Fi.

B004SOR4H6|4.0|But, the app works better on my phone than it does on my Kindle Fire.  On the FIre it forgets who I am, making me log in again and again and stops working occasionally.  It is annoying.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book caught my attention, and I had to read it. I wasn't disappointed. Fast reading....I read it in a day.
B00E3JGCHO|3.0|This concert is one of the highlights of 1970's music.  It is presented here, remixed and remastered, and with the songs in a different order.  Everything works beautifully, although there is no \\"new\\" music here...just the same as the deluxe Rock Of Ages set.  Where things break down completely, though, is with the packaging!  First, the iconic cover image of the Ages set has been replaced with a cheesy, computer enhanced image of The Band with a mocked up marquee behind them.  Second, the award winning essay in Ages by Rob Bowman has been replaced with a much shorter and totally less informative one.  Thirdly,  the two discs are stashed in cardboard sleeves, ensuring they will become scratched, if they are not already when you receive the set.  Fourth, glue that holds the cardboard disc envelopes together likely has gotten on the discs themselves during production, as with my copy.  Fifth,  the booklet is glued in the center portion of the open case, by just its paper back page.  This means it automatically sags under the weight of the booklet and will likely soon  tear out, as only two staples are holding the rest of the booklet to its flimsy back page.  Finally, the booklet is glued in the case crookedly which is totally obvious as the image on it is supposed to line up with the remainder of the image on the cardboard on which the booklet is glued.  What a mess!  And the insult is greater, as the music they have packaged in this careless way is so iconic!  Shame...

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Although there was more violence than I like in a book, the story was well told and seemed so real.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Shaun the Sheep is a hilarious show that is entertaining for all ages. Too bad there are only 3 seasons.
B008D28HYS|5.0|When I first started this game I felt it was a game for kids but once you get past the first set of puzzles this game gets very crazy. The game is very easy to learn,just color in matching squares according to the numbers on the side of the puzzle, sounds easy enough but once you get to the higher levels you'll understand what I mean about this game being difficult. Good luck with this great game.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|Love this! So much of the story rings true and I am able to relate to Cath a lot. Though she write fanfic, while I read it. I didn't want it to end even though it's over 400 pages.<br /><br />Rainbow Rowell doesn't just write about fandom, she creates one. Not only that, she writes the original source material AND the fan fiction. There's more than one story within the same book. Very clever indeed.<br /><br />I also thought the story was going one way, even though I hoped for a different direction, and instead what I hoped is exactly how it went. (Vague sentence is vague in the attempt to not spoil it.)
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|I have tried several different programs but this is easily the best way to learn. The way the lesson is set up makes it easy to use, and fun to learn. It's more like a game where you must complete one area with one or more hearts in order to continue. You learn using pictures,words, and sentences. Very good learning tool.
B0094M32LY|5.0|My grandson loved it.It was one of the better movies that I have downloaded. The clarity was just awesome. Thanks.

0224087444|5.0|Cixi appears in this story as a low-grade concubine who has been chosen by the Emperor to satisfy his pleasures, be they sexual or artistic.  A woman who has no say in political discourse, Cixi demonstrates an unusual intelligence and eventually influence in those family and ministerial members of the imperial family.  Thus, it is no surprise that Cixi sees China going downhill when Western powers begin to flex their military muscles in threats if they are not given more trade rights in previously forbidden Chinese cities.  While these \\"foreign devils\\" are posing war, Cixi is wise enough to discover China's shrinking economy and knows that growth for China lies in modernizing in order to improve her financial status.<br />Westerners perhaps, in this present time of revolutions and coups, fail to appreciate how dramatic it was for Cixi to have a son by Emperor Xianfang and take over as co-Regent with the Emperor's wife, Empress Zhen, after the Emperor's death.  Xianfang had made numerous decrees leading to the Opium War that infuriated foreign traders.  Most unusual was the bond between Empress Zhen and Cixi, who shared precise opinions about foreign and domestic matters; the Empress, on the other hand, was more than willing to take a backseat and let Cixi rule the country.  Her rule continues with carefully calculated plans that wind their way around the opposition ministers of the Court.  Eventually foreigners get more trading rights, places to explore in China, and implementation of industrial inventions, such as the telegraph, electricity and the railroad that benefit all countries involved, including China herself.  The largest fights over these many years is over the trade of opium, a drug that was destroying China; permission for foreign missionaries to minister in interior China, the burning of the Summer Palace by angry foreigners, the increasing incursion of Japan and other nations, and many other debacles that Cixi manages with aplomb and great diplomatic skill.<br />Cixi toward the end of her life recognizes that her son's rule, like his father's, was a total disaster and fears what will occur when she has gone.  She has retired twice but still \\"managed\\" or \\"ruled\\" China for most of her life; the opposite poles of thinking in the Court almost mandate a Parliamentarian style government for the future in which checks and balances will allow no extremist thinking to destroy the progress.  To her credit this was implemented after her death.<br />Every page of this biography, which is also truly a history of China between 1835 and 1912, is fascinating, accurate because of obvious precise research, and exciting.  Many ministers are characterized as well, with their strengths and weaknesses exposed for analysis as they make beneficial and deleterious decisions that Cixi must expand or annul.  It's a perilous but thrilling journey the reader shares with Cixi and Jung Chang has again written a brilliant story about the violence, weak personal characters, tragedies, joys of China in its drive to become a well-respected, modern nation.  Superb in all ways and a great read!skill.<br />Cixi toward the end of her life recognizes that her son's rule, like his father's, was a total disaster and fears what will occur when she has gone.

B00EQRP5LW|4.0|Good music,lyrics and John Legend always brings better songs every time! Definitely worth buying it. You & I is my favorite track
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Excellent book as always with Patricia Cornwell, keeps it moving as far as the suspense, very hard to put down
B00280LYIC|5.0|Another great book by Rick rioden this is a great book for young readers except in part they are in hell ext. ext.
B00BH0VSM6|3.0|Worth a read but not as good as  &#34; The Snowman&#34; or several others. Does give some interesting background history.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|There was definitely not enough happening despite the length of the book. While I do love each of these books, the pace of each character's progress was slower compared to other books in this series.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Not bad i use this like everyday no problems at all. I recommende people to use this product overall pretty good.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Such a great sequel and reader for the next series; I'm not sure how the movie be as good as holding the book in my hands, but I'm excited nonetheless.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is very addictive.  Time just flies by and housework not done! Love the highest score at the end of the game.
B00DTMCSO2|1.0|It's ok. Not a great app it's alright. But you can't go wrong with price. I thought it was hard to navigate.
B00DCX08MW|4.0|It is awesome it has all kinds of planes and it is just awesome that's all I can say ok
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|This a nice app. It really adds volume and EQ to your Kindle Fire HD. I have the Sirius/XM and this really added to the sound. I loved it and you will too!
B002BE7JE8|5.0|All of us after seeing this movie as kids scared the living s*** out of us. We wanted to burn our toys and shoot them in the heart and get them out of our lives. Child's Play is so far the best in the Child's Play/Chucky franchise. The story was fantastic and had that one quote that we all hear in our heads when we think of dolls, \\"Hi, I'm Chucky wanna play?\\". I can not stop watching this great classic horror flick. Must buy for a horror movie fan and those with a fear of dolls might wanna stay away from it!
B00632HWOG|5.0|I really like this app for my Kindle Fire HD. It's easy to navigate and makes a quiet little &#34;ding&#34; when you received new mail. Really nice app. You'll like it.
B0058S0OMS|3.0|First of all this sequel to Halloween (1978) is way too gory and bloody for a Michael Myers flick. I thought Jamie Lee Curtis was great in it, It still has fantastic suspense moments just like the first installment. Begins immediately after the first Halloween concluded. I'd say give it a go, but if it's the last of your money don't go spending it off on this get the first movie over this one.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|In this household we are Big Bang Theory fans.  We now have the series 1 through 6.  We love The Big Bang Theory, and I am not that good @ science!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|So much fun. I love minions there so cute. This game is also really easy to play but it's super fun. Love it
B007VDN1PA|2.0|When I had the photos printed, the quality was not there, not sharp enough.  Photos looked faded and I used a very good quality photo printer.
B00EE3FTNM|3.0|Beautifully done, but plodding, dreary, and devastating. Can you take six hours of unrelenting tragedy, ending in one of the most harrowing revelation scenes you will ever be asked to suffer through? If you think the presence of a former Dr. Who in the cast means there will be any touch of lightness here, you're wrong.  Perfectly acted and photographed, but uplifting or entertaining? No. Unless you're French. Then, you'll love it.
B0012GMYUU|5.0|The reason I love listening to Jeff Beck is the expression he puts into his guitar work seems to be something that a lot of musicians miss.  The good ones all have it.  It is also remarkable to me that he still has the chops.  You know he has been at it since the 60's.
B00F8GYC1Y|3.0|New levels and characters are fun but my 6 & 8 year olds finished all the available levels in less than a week. This game needs more material available sooner. Also, the telepods are a gimmick and not worth the additional money.
B009RX7WTI|5.0|I love Grey's Anatomy and have ordered each season off Amazon. Love the price and the prompt delivery. Already waiting to get the 10th  season that just started.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I did not know about the series until my group of 12 ladies got together for a dinner night.  They were all talking about it so..... I came home and realized I could view all 3 seasons on my Kindle as a Prime member absolutely free.<br /><br />Needless to say I could not stop watching!!!  I didn't want to end.  So looking forward to Season 4 and beyond.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this trilogy and Gideon's and Eva's characters. I have recommended this book to numerous people. I can't wait for the other books in the series to come out.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This show has been one of our favorites. The &#34;Kalinda&#34; character is our favorite. &#34;Alicia&#34; is okay but a bit greedy at times.  She holds &#34;Peter&#34; to a higher standard than she herself lives and readily abandons her fellow associates for her own gain.  We cringe every time she pines for &#34;Will.&#34;  We also enjoy &#34;Eli&#34; and &#34;Cary&#34; a lot.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a very good book and very difficult to put down. You feel for this child's parents. The nightmare they lived through
B00BGD8CFK|2.0|There's nothing super-wrong with the \\"Slim Armor\\" case, and the color options are nice, but it doesn't really live up to either the \\"Slim\\" or the \\"Armor\\" halves of its name.  It's quite bulky, especially around the edges, compared to really slim competing products like [[ASIN:B0097EUVVI Diztronic]] and [[ASIN:B009KY45FI Belkin]].  The power button is very unresponsive and hard to operate through the case, and the ring/silent switch is almost too deeply recessed to operate with a finger or fingernail. And the case doesn't extend far enough in front of the phone to provide any real protection when laying it face-down on a table -- it fits nearly flush in places.  And the fit is very sensitive to manufacturing problems -- the one I received protrudes unevenly around the edges of the phone. It's not a bad case but it's not a great value for the money. (Reviewed using an iPhone 5S.)
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Just started reading the books and it is quite pleasing to see of the characters are brought to life on the screen.  No movie or show can capture the essence and thoughts of written characters but this show does a great job of staying close to the book.  Highly recommended.
B00CATSONE|4.0|A very easy-to-read book that tells a story of persistance and optimism of a real genius. You will find it difficult to leave the book aside until you finish it. It is inspiring and makes you aware of the difficulties and injustice that many inventors have to face in order to complete their work. Even thoughTtesla's story if full of obstacles and misdemeanors, his passion and enthusiasm were a force so powerful that he was able to create during all of his life.<br /><br />For those who study creativity or are interested in the subject, this brief book will contribute to their general background knowledge.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|&#34;The Good Wife Season 4&#34; is packed with excellent dialogue, courtroom intrigue, personal conflicts, political campaigns and election fraud and blended into a wonderfully complicated drama. I expect the next season to be just as interesting. I recommend it to you if you enjoy courtroom programs.
B00C7KYXHW|4.0|I loved it until the end. Then a little frustrated with the show. However watching the psychological aspect is fascinating ...
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Ana is too good for Christian and her grief should be brief when she realizes. A good love story with an interesting twist.
B000SW2F8A|5.0|Great love story,  and a show of courage and strength to do what's right even though it's not what your heart wants.
B00992CF6W|2.0|ok so um. I have played this multiple times on other devices. its awesome too. but I wanna know why it wont download on my kindle. I already payed for it and all it says is install but when I press the button it says error. I checked the credit card info and it still wont work. what else is there to do..
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|While I felt the story line of this movie is probably closer to the goal of the original, I felt that the original made for a better movie. This movie was very dark, with far too much use of slow mow. I definitely would have been disappointed at spending money to see this in a movie theater.
B00EY8ARYS|3.0|Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. has a lot of Joss Whedon's signature self-referential humor and witty wordplay on showcase. Perhaps a little too much. It's tone was too light and fluffy, as were the characters. As a sidequel to The Avengers, Agents of S.HI.E.L.D. was very welcome. Judged on it's own, it's too self-referential, cliched, and cheesy to rank with Whedon's other successes.<br /><br />I know just one episode is out now, so I'm willing to give this show another chance, and I DID enjoy some of the rapport, action, and in-jokes, but Marvel needs to up the bar. Raise the danger and the suspense, drop the cheesy jokes, and THAT'S when you can call me a fan. If you're looking for good superhero TV fare, seek out CW's [[ASIN:B009OYTIXS Arrow]], or if you're extremely patient just wait for Avengers 2, which should be awesome.<br /><br />P.S. I will watch this show for as long as I have to to find out about Agent Coulson. What happened in Tahiti? And what does Agent Hill know...?
B00BFIFIPS|2.0|It didn't exactly fit the way I wanted it to fit. Yes the 5S fit into the case, but the case easily peeled off the phone so I didn't trust that it'd protect my phone from drops and scratches. It looked as if there were a tiny bit of room on the top and bottom of the case which suggests why it'd be peeled off so easily. Sad to have returned it, but I'm not risking having my phone stick out of the case.
B009OYTIXS|4.0|CW's hit superhero series ARROW succeeds largely based on one impressive aspect: the powerful performance of it's lead player, Stephen Amell, as playboy-turned-vigilante Oliver Queen.<br /><br />Stephen Amell has gravitas, good looks, and charisma, and on top of that, is a phenomenal actor. He perfectly portrays the hardened and edgy human weapon that came off that Pacific island a changed man from the naive playboy who set foot on it. His scenes as Green Arrow are the highlight of the film: usually stylized, cinematic action scenes where various henchman get shot in varyingly badass ways. I'm not calling Amell the next Christian Bale, though both nail brutal fighting tactics, costumes, and masks like pros. I *am* saying he is an incredible actor that really takes the material a step up from what he's given and keeps the audience quietly riveted to the screen.<br /><br />But let me just say that I thought that Queen's wisecracking friend was incredibly annoying, and Laurel was both terribly miscast and extremely cliched (the super-hot law official's daughter who is also really smart and has conflicted love interests). Also, the dialogue was slightly hammy at times, and some acting whiffed of cheese. CW needs to make the show darker and gritter - more edgy and up the stakes with the villains. More gritty Gotham, less shining Metropolis.<br /><br />But I'm not complaining.<br /><br />I love the fast-paced plots and mood, and anytime we: A. See Oliver training in some illogical but awesome way. B. See Green Arrow take out dudes with a bow. - well, let me just say it's incredibly entertaining. ARROW breaks the Curse of Superhero TV Series, and has opened the gateway to other shows such as Marvel's Agent's of S.H.I.E.L.D., an upcoming Flash series, a Lieutenant Gordon prequel, and a John Constantine series (still in the works).<br /><br />I expect to be sticking around with this show for some time in the future! The sharp characters and excellent acting from Stephen Amell make Arrow a suspenseful, cinematic, and action-packed crowd pleaser! Arrow has hit the bullseye! 4+ stars!l make Arrow a suspenseful, cinematic, and action-packed crowd pleaser! Arrow has hit the bullseye! 4+ stars!

B005544V6A|5.0|LOVE this show. So witty, but not a comedy. Fantastic acting. The chemistry between all the actors works so well and they feed off of each other fantastically.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Really fun game.  Great graphics.  Perfect game to pass the time.  I love these kind of game.  Always  have  You thinking.  Wish there were more games like this.

B00BESM14U|5.0|This is one of the best movies of 2012. Mature but not condescending teen movie. Don't hesistate. Great twists in the story.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Cleaver and witty, this show has allot to offer in a stream of disappointing media. The characters are robustly entertaining and storyline well written. USA network really knocked it out of the ballpark with this one.
B0060AY85C|5.0|This was required reading for my grandson so I thought I'd give it a try.  I was not disappointed. A little slow going in the beginning but it gets better with each chapter.

B00F2LIV4E|5.0|I've been a Dream Theater fan since '92.  This album is the best since Images and Words.  To the band, congratulations and thank you.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great! It's fun for me and for my three year old. Lol. We take turns and enjoy all four different areas. Good graphics and easy controls!
0071752854|5.0|At a minimum, Oren's methods and approach will give you more confidence. This is not light reading - the author spent &#62;10,000 hours researching developing these skills.
1907590099|4.0|Lots of large words, but interesting readng. This book is certainly not for everyone. I haven't finished the whole book yet.

B007MNV5WU|3.0|Though pretty to look at and well thought out.  I just couldn't get the piggies on my own.  Always by accident.  I didn't hate the game.  Maybe I'll try it later.
B00199B2Z8|4.0|Typical Bryson.  Funny, well researched, interesting.  I've read better from him, but I liked it.<br />I count myself a huge fan.

B00F91H666|2.0|It really didn't keep our attention.  It jumped straight into a story line that had no build up and therefore no investment in the characters or plot.  By the end it picked up some but I would not recommend it to my friends.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have been playing Minecraft since before the 1.2.5 update on the computer. Then it came out for the xbox! Then the ipod! Now android devices!

B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I was surprised that this was a cute movie that both my husband and I liked and there was a bit more depth to it then the previews showed.  Certainly worth a watch for a fun Friday / Saturday night movie.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Very well done! Choreography coordination of the story and continuance of each episode is very well put together. I would love to see more stories
B00E8S2KV2|5.0|Let me just preface this review by saying I am not an \\"only movie\\" fan. Yes, I was introduced to the series by the movies, but I took the time to read the books, including the Hobbit. So do I know that this is only very loosely tied to the book? Yes. Do I think that if they had stuck true to the story, then it would have only needed to be one movie long? Yes. In fact, when I first heard about the trilogy, then I thought \\"Peter Jackson, you had better perform a miracle or this is going to be a loooong few years.\\" I went to the movie with some apprehension, despite being a die-hard LOTR fan and a firm believer in Martin Freeman's acting capability.<br /><br />But I was blown away.<br /><br />This movie is beautiful. They manage to include elements from the Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales, as well as include elements that did actually happen during the Hobbit, but were only told about in the LOTR trilogy. I appreciate the character development they performed on Thorin, because in the book, let's face it, he was kind of a jerk. In the movie, the greed and pride in his character are still evident, but so is the nobility and loyalty to his people, making him much more enjoyable and lovable.<br /><br />The acting was superb, of course. Ian McKellan and Martin Freeman proved to be an excellent duo, and the return of Andy Serkis was lovely.<br /><br />To those who think that there were scenes that dragged: sorry if Peter Jackson can't adjust to your twenty-first century, 30 second attention spans. In a way, this made the movie more real to me, because the truth is that some things do take longer than three seconds, and one does not simply battle through an orc mountain without it taking some time.<br /><br />To those that considered the dwarves to be irritatingly cartooney: That's how dwarves are. Read the book, and you'll find that they generally weren't dignified at all times. They were often childish and a little bit immature. They did break out in song, frequently. They did perform that scene with Bilbo's dishes. I'd rather cartooney than unrealistically serious at all times. Dwarves have a sense of humor.<br /><br />To those who haven't seen it yet: enjoy.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|I really enjoyed the whole series of these books. I enjoyed the characters and plot. The series proved to be an enjoyable light read.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|A must read if you're a Housseni fan. The pages tell of stark realism, pain, sorrow and sacrifice. Can hardly wait for the next page gripper,
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Fun as you try to complete all the levels.  This is the best version of all the Angry Bird app games.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books are great, after reading the first book I couldn't wait to read the other two.  By the second book I was on pins and needles to find out how it was going to end.  I'm glad I found these books after they were all published, I don't think I could have taken the torture of waiting for each book to be published to find out what happened.<br /><br />Like all books this series may not be for everyone.  The series centres around the Hunger Games.  Citizens of Panem are forced to watch their children be picked for a game every year that leaves only one victor.<br /><br />The story is well written and descriptive.
B00594XOZU|1.0|It wont even let me log on it says &quot; taking longer than it should try in Bit&quot;  plz fix i want to talk to my babe
B00BUCXVPI|4.0|In a sea of bad movies the year Jack Reacher was release I am surprised that it did not get more attention.<br /><br />Solid movie with Tom Cruise who is also underrated as an actor.  If you are looking for a good popcorn flick check this one out.
B00BF2RTO2|5.0|This is easily one of Iron Maiden's two best live DVDs ever.  Most people would consider Live After Death to be their best recorded live show, but I would consider Maiden England to be even better.  Both live recordings follow each of their best albums (imo) and offer material from each album, but the sound quality is clearly better in Maiden England.<br /><br />I like how Steve had control over the filming of this one, and gave the user a view as if they were in the crowd, the setlist was top notch with the exclusion of songs from Powerslave (which we get from Live After Death). The main downside is I hear Bruce was sick when this was recorded; some of the time you can't even tell, but a few times he was a little off.  I thought he absolutely nailed Moonchild and Infinite Dreams as well as humanly possible, but on some tracks (like The Prisoner) he was a little bit off at times.  But he's not terribly off as well, and considering the tracks he nails, the occasional blip can easily be overlooked.<br /><br />I own the original VHS, which I bought still sealed around 10 years ago (might have been the last still-sealed copy on the planet?) and the newly released remastered version titled \\"Maiden England '88\\".  The remaster does the recording justice -- the sound quality is very good and even after being remastered, it remains true to the production quality of the day as opposed to today's rather weak over production where incompetent producers get off by compressing everything to 100% (I guarantee albums like Powerslave or Seventh Son of a Seventh Son would not be the same album with a modern producer).

031623480X|5.0|I love this book!  I am recommending it to all my patients because even if you don't have a neurological disease, brain fog, concentration, memory issues plague everyone as they age.  Dr Perlmutter lays out a common sense strategy and explanation for how systemic illness effects your brain and what you can do about it.  Easy to read and follow .  I recommend this book very highly!<br /><br />If you want to learn more about autoimmune diseases using the same functional medicine approach, check out:  [[ASIN:1451694970 The Immune System Recovery Plan: A Doctor's 4-Step Program to Treat Autoimmune Disease]]
B008PZZYB2|1.0|I have no idea who this movie would appeal to.  The characters were so weird and full of the most gad-awful faces and expressions and so idiotic. I watched it for maybe 20 minutes to give it a chance but nothing.....
B007ZGO7EM|2.0|Do not understand the  instructions for putting it onto my kindle so am unable to comment on how good or bad it is. I have downloaded it I believe but cannot find it.

B00EEXST2K|4.0|A surprising look at the life of Linda Lovelace showing the years of abuse she went through with her husband who had forced her into pornography and the not so glamorous side of her fame. Very classily done, never actually showing the film or sex.<br /><br />Amanda Seyfried was phenomenal.

B00F91RYL8|1.0|I don't know what is wrong with Brad Pitt, but his acting was mediocre, to my taste. Additionally, the story was not exciting and I did not feel \\"diving into the movie\\".<br />I gave one star because I expected much more based on the trailer.
B00F7YHDWC|2.0|The characters looked like the video. That is its only redeeming quality. The game is almost worthless. One slip of the finger and you must sit through an annoying  movie advert. Removed from my device.

0812982622|5.0|Don't be put off by the all American sounding name of the author of \\"The Orphan Master's Son\\" (Adam Johnson). Set in North Korea, Mr. Johnson's novel is sourced from defectors' accounts, meticulous research, and one personal visit stripped of authenticity and depth by the ferocious secrecy of that country.<br /><br />I'm not sure what to believe in this book, the story of Jun Do, who grows up in an orphanage, survives factories and labour camps, only to be swept into a secret agent life that swings between horrific violence and mind numbing drudgery, from ships to prisons to commanding positions close to the Dear Leader himself.<br /><br />\\"His tailbone had gone from numb to fire to dumb. Dust filled the canopy, gravel shot up through the trans axles, and his life returned to enduring... He felt the pain as a memory... their common exhaustion articulated as a singularity.\\"<br /><br />I know \\"The Orphan Master's Son\\" terrified me, the second half especially. I kept putting it down, despite its essential readability, its very American jocularity of speech, jarring and easy to swallow as it was.<br /><br />\\"That kind of talk gave Jun Do the willies.\\"<br /><br />It reminded me of the flayed skin torture scene in Murakami's \\"The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle,\\" another book I put down for weeks before I could finish. It's not that I'm squeamish (I am). But I don't think there's anyone who wouldn't be shocked at what happens in this novel. It's as if it's the last great horrible secret in the world, the kind of violence that happens everyday among individuals, but this, a grand communal flaying of spirit and flesh.<br /><br />\\"In Prison 33, all of a person's self deceit was slowly broken down, until even the fundamental lies that formed your identity faltered and fell... Pain - that towering white flower - can only be used once... Then as now, we do not need sight to see what you have become.\\"<br /><br />Mr. Johnson's language is mostly stark and simple, and occasionally slips into lyricism: \\"the oven-colored light... the milk dark of the star-choked sky... Each note striking, flaring, and losing timbre like a match that burns to smoke... The Milky Way reeled above them, the smell of creosote and dry granite sweeping down from the mountains... How the once-black ink had turned blue and hazy as it migrated under the old man's skin, a watercolor where indelibility had been, leaving only the stain of the woman he loved.\\"<br /><br />The loudspeaker is an ever present oppression in this novel, stories and platitudes shouted over them day and night. The names of various places (Testament to the Greatness of Machines Factory, Self Criticism Pavilion) would be comical if I had no doubt about their existence.<br /><br />Despite the wild hunger and pain and desperation that Jun Do and his compatriots experience, the inhumanities dealt them by all too human people, my most striking experience of reading this book was the idea of not owning one's life, deeper than poverty's back breaking soul crushing weight, which might still allow you to dream, however uselessly, to see what you can't have. \\"The Orphan Master's Son\\" is a portrait of a totalitarian state that has succeeded so brilliantly that there is no dream, of anything at all.<br /><br />\\"Where was the film that had no beginning, an unrelenting middle, and ended over and over... There was no such thing as abandonment, there were only people in impossible positions... There's no name for it, Buc said. There's no name because no one's ever done it before.\\"<br /><br />I've been writing a novel about memory loss, in which losing your history, your identity is a tragic thing. In \\"The Orphan Master's Son,\\" this loss becomes a mercy. There are fleet glimpses of normalcy, or what I think of as normal human emotion, hope or longing, feelings I don't usually consider a luxury.<br /><br />\\"Tomorrow's in the air right now, circling the world to us... The wound of not knowing, Ga said to her, That's the one that never heals.\\"<br /><br />But then it circles back to despair, though in Jun Do's eyes, there is only just what is.<br /><br />\\"Compared to forgetting, does living really stand a chance?\\"<br /><br />Maybe not.
B007ZI06FE|5.0|I loved all three books in this series. They all have similar story arcs, but that's ok. I found the books all entertaining and wasn't looking for super intellectual literature. I recommend!

B003NRYMZQ|5.0|Even though the &#34;monsters&#34; are a bit cheezy, the storylines are believable and the characters sympathetic. By the end of the second series it gets a bit old.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The best British series. Enjoyed every season. Sad ending to season 3, but I am sure  season 4 will make up for it.
B00DB3HJ8E|5.0|One of the best TV shows after The Wire, Sopranos and Breaking Bad. Exceptionally well done! Exceptionally well done! I've watched it more than twice at this point; highly recommended!
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Really liked it and the story behind it. Its just something that you would like to experience to get some of that cash.
B002ZG98J6|2.0|I was disappointed in the screen writing of The Lighting Thief. The Percy Jackson books were written well, The screen writers don't seem to have a clue about the 5 book series and how many future events are introduced in the first book. I will probably see the other movies if the are produced, but keep my books.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|The game is pretty good and so are the graphics but the controls are a bit stiff but other than that This game is great!

B003WUYOQ6|2.0|Gary had some good info but I just don't like his attitude.

B00BH0VSM6|5.0|I wish that I had read Nesbo's  Harry Hole novels in order, and I wish that I had read  THE BAT first because it provides Harry's backstory and explains a lot of why Harry is the way he is.  In this novel,  we witness how good Harry is at getting into the mind of a serial killer and how he solves complicated crimes with his trademark obsession for details.  There were many red herrings in the story that led you to think that you knew who had committed the crime,  but I was surprised at the real killer's identity.  And,  what an ending!!
B000HZHBIM|2.0|I feel the movie was great. It was a fun movie to watch and enjoy. Oops wait,  Update i thought I was rating Star Trek Into darkness. ST the Motion Picture is irrelevant, outdated.
B002QCAXOS|3.0|The rest of the movie was weird.  The scenery was  AWESOME!  I wonder if the place looks the same today.
B009AMAJPA|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />\\"Dead Man Down\\" starts off as a bit of a muddled mess, but once it finally reveals where it's headed, it rises to the level of a better-than-average tale of revenge.<br /><br />Colin Farrell plays a Hungarian immigrant whose wife and little daughter were killed a few years back by some mobsters during a real estate deal gone south. Now Farrell has gone undercover to exact his revenge on the men responsible for destroying his life. Meanwhile, to further complicate matters, an attractive neighbor (Noomi Rapace), who's been disfigured in a car crash, enlists him to kill the man responsible for the accident.<br /><br />Though the plotting is not entirely plausible all the way through, the screenplay by J. H. Wyman manages to keep the characters front-and-center most of the time. And as with any good revenge melodrama, the characters learn that the desire for retribution often winds up eating away at the very person who, in theory at least, it is supposed to be helping to heal.<br /><br />Niels Arden Oplev has directed the film with moody conviction, and the stars are nicely buttressed by Terrance Howard, Dominic Cooper, Armand Assante, F Murray Abraham and Isabelle Hupert in secondary roles.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|An excellent summary of where we are all at in terms of business relationships anno 2013. Applies equally to men and women with ambition.
B008Y2VTIS|5.0|Everything about this program speaks of quality. The acting is superb, the plots always interesting and the costumes and settings elaborate. Once you have watched one episode you are hooked and can't wait to see what happens. There are strong sexual scenes so it is not for children. I haven's finished watching season 2 and I have already purchased season 3 because I know I will be delighted.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|This is a character-driven epic that draws you in, twists your nose, and shakes your emotions. This is the best Brit-import I've ever watched. Some of the situations may be a bit contrived and manipulated, but the characters -- the script and the acting -- hold me from beginning to the end.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Season 2 is really when this show starts to get really fun. The characters are better developed, the stories get better....this whole show just ups it's game.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Thoroughly loved the mix and depth of the characters, the plot twists, the pace and the scenery. Each episode was another mark of the tide, swelling with a mix of hope and suspicion.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Husband loves this app....keeps him busy while I read yeah<br />I even get involved sometimes, but he's better at it
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use this for my regular shopping and errand list, as well as for gift ideas, notes on which batteries go in what watch, and so many other things. My favorite feature is the ability to draw a line through an item in the checklist without deleting it. That way if there is a grocery item I buy frequently, I can cross it off but still save it at the bottom of the list to uncross the next time I need it. It has been WONDERFUL handy since finding that I have celiac and having to note specific brand names for every item on my grocery list. That way I can cross it off, but save the item for next time I need it, and I don't have to search all over again to find which brands I can eat. This is a great app for anyone who uses lists, but especially detailed ones.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|Comes in handy....haven't had a need to use real often, but nice to know I have it. Keyholes on dark night perfect
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was not captivated by this book, despite the praise in some of these other reviews. I was quite relieved when it was finished actually. The story line is unique and all but I could not relate in any way to any of the characters.
B005V4ZEY2|5.0|I love the app. Gives me rest of mind. Activation was smooth. I simply logged on to mt Amazon account and activated it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|One of the best shows ever! Looking forward to the next season! Too bad we have to wait a year to see the next season.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Great customer service!<br />Works better than expected!<br />Love the hot switching sensitivity buttons and optional weights for a solid feel. I would definitely recommend this product.
B00DJ0S9BU|5.0|The Diving Board is a move to a new musical direction by<br />the fantastic one. 43 years on and now 66 years young,he crosses the bridge to a rainbow of music genres. Adult contemporary music. Jazz,light rock,gospel,blues,country,and pop . Gone are the tra-la-las and la-di-das. They're in his rear view mirror. \\"And you can't go back,if you try it fails.\\"..... Bernie Taupin Speaking of his co writer,Bernie Taupin,\\"the master of the written word\\",he paints cinematic short stories,hands the lyrics to Elton,never in the same room,and a song is born. Their music is timeless. Both,the Captain and the Kid,have hit a grand slam,on their recent,Diving Board.Elton's vocals in a low register,are superb.His early music influences come to the fore front,ie.Etta James,Sarah Vaughn,Nina Simone,BB King,Eartha Kitt,etc. I give this album,a 5 star rating. \\"Thank God,my music's still alive!\\"....Bernie Taupin<br />There is something for everyone on this masterpiece!<br />Kudos to T Bone Burnett,and the studio musicians.<br />If this is Elton's last studio album,all i can say is, he went out in a blaze of glory.The Gems-Mexican Vacation,The Ballad of Blind Tom,Oceans Away,Oscar Wilde Gets Out,My Quick Sand.Actually,in my opinion,there are no weak tracks on the album.
B0036FYO12|5.0|The technology may be outdated but it's still an important part of the story and it still works. You don't have to know what a telephone switchroom looks like to appreciate that our hero &#34;reads everything&#34; and has learned a lot about literature, technology and politics. It's another Sydney Pollack gem.

This DVD was a gift to our 10 year old grandson-whose mom-our daughter, also enjoyed Michael when she was a teen.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is BEST! Minions cute and so funny. This game for sure passes temple run and subway surfers. All the new updates are so cool. I love the unicorn this game is so catchy.
B004UPAN6W|5.0|Lots of action, and excitement for everyone in the family over the age of 13.  His story is painful, and interesting.  There is allot of bloodshed, so be mindful of that before allowing kids to view.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I avoided this series when it first became popular because the reviews were so bad. Since the announcement that Charlie Hunnam had been cast for the lead role for the movie, I've decided to see it. Though how anyone thought these books merited a movie is beyond me. But I digress.<br /><br />The books are very repetitive and lack any real substance. It's nothing but sex, fighting, and more sex. The biggest problem I had, however, was how the main female character started out as a happy, confident woman and was then turned into an insecure doormat who continued to allow this man to treat her horribly all in the name of love. Somehow we're supposed to be ok with his behavior just  because he's so damaged. That sends a very dangerous message to women out there who are in abusive relationships and think they can change their abuser if they just love them enough.<br /><br />All that being said, I think Charlie Hunnam can possibly do something good with this character. He is an excellent actor with great range. And, of course, he's wicked hot!
B001KZG99A|5.0|Iron Man is one of my favorite superhero movies.  Robert Downey Jr. is perfect as Tony Stark.  I like what he brings to the character in terms of maturity and intelligence.  This is a movie I have watched many times!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Can't wait to read the next book!! This was full of suspense and never let up. Highly recommended for teens and adults.

B000HL2J0G|5.0|Great look back at old tech with young MacGyver - and a great start for the Stargate series - but the acting is only so so
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I have enjoyed watching the show on prime since I can watch them one after another and not have to wait for the next season.
B00BVYU2P2|5.0|Great show!! It reminds me of a modern wonder years!! Overall you will not be disappointed!<br />The series seems to be getting better after each season.
B009715NUK|4.0|Leaving is great, and Hell is fun and tongue-in-cheek.  But In His Imagination HAS TO BE one of the very best songs PSB have ever written!  WOW!  How it isn't/wasn't a MEGA hit is beyond me.  Buy it if only for that.  It's deep, catchy, and musically amazing!<br /><br />The first time I heard it I liked it.  But the more I listened to it - - - Wow, better and better.  Buy it.  Too bad it doesn't have an official video.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so AWESOME! You should get it right now. It's worth the 7 dollars. If you like action and creation this is the game for you.
B00C7JGDBW|3.0|Visually stunning film, Franco's (Oz) talent fluctuated throughout the movie, Mila Kunis was below average, the role was beyond her and it showed although she was beautiful to look at as Theodora, two key roles that should've been chosen more carefully, Weisz and Williams(Evanora and Glinda) were good, the movie had so much promise if the acting and writing was better, I like that there were elements of the 1939 film added which was a nice touch but overall it could've been better. **1/2.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|15 years into the marriage, Andy decides this is the time to tell his bride that his father and grandfather were murderers.
