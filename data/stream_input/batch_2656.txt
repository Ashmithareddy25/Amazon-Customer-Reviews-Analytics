B00000J2PH|5.0|Nothing like Carole King, and being able to download the entire cd from Amazon, and received the disc was just icing on the cake!  Absolutely one of my favorites, and I've been wanting to add it back to my collection for sometime now.  Found it on Amazon at a reasonable price, and arrived before it was due!  I received an e-mail telling me that I could download it, so I got to enjoy it before I even received the actual  cd!
B00005JKBC|4.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies ever. Robert Redford shines in this classic, and it's just so beautifully done that I have watched it on more than 50 separate occasions and still enjoyed it.<br />Very real, no nonsense kind of movie about what spying is about.
B0078XFYDA|5.0|I'm Evelyn`s husband and I love Richard Dawkins books!  I hope to teach my children to think like him.<br />Delightful!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Interesting plot.<br />I like the music.<br />This show is good.<br />I love it.<br />You should see it.<br />Go for it.
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|This is great for people who wish to make texture packs all you do is import your png file picture edit it and then export the newly made png texture! WORKS GREAT!!! I love the different paint brushes and just over all selection. I would highly recommend that you get this app if you love art in any way!
B000002V07|4.0|Sort of like the Doors with less keyboard or a poor man's Echo & The Bunnymen with a female vocalist.  Interesting but not overbearing. Not bad.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Denzel Washington portrays a high-functioning alcoholic with incredible veracity—unlike his character who cannot keep from drinking or lying throughout most of the film. It's a stunner with a very scary opening scene. I would watch it again.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love it! I Like how everything ties together. Multiple puzzles that lead to the escape. I would defenitly recommend this app.
B00BPA6XUK|3.0|When purchasing the CD of the soundtrack, I checked to see if there were more than one version, i.e. a single disk standard and a more complete version, as I was looking for as much of the music as possible.  This CD is the openly physical copy available.<br /><br />Of course after purchasing and receiving the CD, I then found that when buying a downloadable MP3 or iTunes version, there IS a more complete soundtrack/score with many more songs for the same price as the edited down CD.<br /><br />A bit irritating.
B00101ZOTK|4.0|This story stays fresh even after watching it about 6 times. The concept, the characters, the actors all made this a thoroughly enjoyable movie. I don't want to say anything more than to say...WATCH THIS MOVIE!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Great movie with dark comedy. Parker and Willis play off each other very well. Well written. A fun movie if your just an average guy that doesn't want his movies to &#34;make a statement&#34; or be so PC they forget to be good. Cant wait for Red 2
B00CWY76CC|5.0|i really enjoyed the challenge of this game.. i found myself wanting to keep playing even with my short attention spam.
B000VOC90Y|4.0|I just purchased a new laptop and quite honestly, didn't realize quite how large it was.  I've had my current Swiss Gear (who happens to also make this backpack) pack for over eight years and I love it.  Problem was, it didn't fit my new, larger laptop.  Anyway, the construction is top notch, there's plenty of room to store whatever you may need, and the pack itself is comfortable to wear with padded straps and back. There's even a port (space) for your earphones.  The laptop pocket/sleeve is well constructed with plenty of protection.  The only drawback I have to this model is the side pockets - I wish they were a little deeper.  Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone searching for a laptop backpack for any laptop but especially a larger size laptop.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is amazing I am 10 years old and  after I get home after homework I go one here they should make one about Africa one and I love the game .  :)
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Downton is so addicting! The characters are rich in detail, the historical context is amazing, and the plotlines are delightful.  Maggie Smith absolutely steals the show with her wit and zeal.  How the staff interact with one another is pure fun to watch.  And as times change, and stations in life are questioned, it is interesting to see how the wealthy come to terms with all of it.  Downton Abbey has something for everyone and does an excellent job of recreating the era of England following World War I.
B00BN3DPQ4|3.0|Arnold is getting just a little bit old to be making action movies, but in this movie he is supposed to be an aging sheriff in a small town an it works. What can I say, this is an action movie. The first half of the movie is spent developing the characters and plot. The second half of the movie is the unfolding of the plot and all of the action. In my opinion there are too many secondary characters and none of them gets fully developed in this movie. Arnold has no love interest or family in this movie. So all you are really left with is the action. This is the kind of movie that you really only want to watch once, so I'm not sure if investing in a Blu-Ray disc is the best idea. If I had it to do over, I would just rent the movie from Netflix or Red Box. This movie and its plot are no where near the quality of movies such as the \\"Die Hard\\" or \\"Lethal Weapon\\" series. The problem for Arnold is that he is getting too old to play the muscle bound protector that saves the world and that is all he really has to offer. I like Arnold, but I'm afraid he I going to have to develop some acting skills or find some new stories that fit his aging character if he is to continue to put out movies.
B00BGIC4I6|5.0|Having hit 40 myself a little over a year ago, this movie resonated with me in so many ways.  Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann do an incredible job of playing a married couple in the middle of their marriage, dealing with their parents, teenage children, careers, sex, friends, money, and more.  I laughed out loud, recognized myself numerous times, and knew that it was all going to be ok in the end.  Even my 16-yr-old daughter loved the film.  I recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys a good comedy.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|We had heard friends talk about the show, but we had never watched any of it.  Once we watched the first episode of Season 1, we were hooked.  We watched Season 1, 2 and 3 over about a three week period.  Season 3 was the best.  Now we can't wait for Season 4 to start.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Just awful and I enjoy SciFy and fantasy. Certainly not worth my rental fee at all. Recommend against wasting your money.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|Some uncommon plot twists.  Misdirection and somewhat far fetched but does not detract from a good mystery  Enjoyed it a lot.  Read in almost one sitting.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book has a slow gentle pace ; was well written, and has a poetic feel about it. It gives insight on the present situation in that area.
B00574P9EQ|5.0|I bought the whole series of Diary of a Wimpy Kid for my youngest grandson.  Noah Fredrick is seven and he absolutely loves this series.  Then we rented the movie, Diary of a Wimpy Kid:  Rodrick Rules.  We watched it together on the Kindle Fire and the animation/illustration and acting was riveting.  It was a very happy evening for family time!  I highly recommend this series.  We laughed and parts were so real to life.  Thank you for these treasures for children.  Abigail
B0050DIWFC|4.0|From the opening until the end, this book keeps your interest. It is very hard to put down. The ending is really foreshowed and not a surprise but not a disappointment.
B001NAZWA4|5.0|There are some great songs on here that capture the early energy of a U2 performance.  U2 continues to be a far better live band than they ever are in the studio - and this performance shows that this was true throughout their career.  The Electric Co. and 11 O'Clock Tick Tock are just amazing live.  When U2 was just starting in the early 80's, they didn't have a lot of songs, so they often did songs twice in the same set (11 O'Clock Tick Tock was often one of these).<br /><br />Any real fan of U2 will want this release in their collection!
B00CCEHR80|5.0|Naturally, I got the Garcia Live Volume One.  It is fantastic.  So when I heard that Garcia Live Volume Two was coming out, I just had to have it.
B009HNDCC4|5.0|Another stellar season especially when some shows already start fading or have already been cancelled by the time a fourth season can even be done.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|couldn't put the book down.  hope there is more to come in this serious  really loved it  read it in one day
B00B4804KS|5.0|This movie was overlooked by me at the time it was released but because i recently bought a 60\\" panasonic 3-D tv i get to enjoy this movie in 1080p 3-D like its the first time seeing it! and its pretty damn good too. not to mention the 3-D is some of the best on blu-ray 3-D i've seen highly reccomended for blu-ray 3-D collecters.P.S the audio ain't too shabby ether.
B002J2RDA2|5.0|Such an awesome movie and very underrated.  Tarantino has recently said that this is his worst movie and wants to make sure that everything else he does is better, and while that might be true, this is still a fun as hell horror movie.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|The talent on the show is great. If you love song and dance you'll love Smash. The songs are catchy and they'll get stuck in your head. It shows the cut throat, deal with it atmosphere of broadway and the bond that the cast begins to share as a show is being made. The fist half of the season is perfect the second half starts to throw in random \\"day-dream\\" musical sequences that are Glee-esque so I'm not sure what changed but all in all still very entertaining and worth while.
B007SGM084|1.0|I totally regret buying the trilogy bundle. These three books are the worse books ever! I wish I could get my money back!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Goes deeper yet into the wars for the seven kingdoms. Waiting for the next chapter to unfold. Too many twists and turns to describe.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Nice combination of simple to challenging. Good for a beginner.  Grids do not always provide hints of the object to be revealed.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|its a fun game if you enjoy the farmville style games. its nice to not have to plow and plant eveytime
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|Smart, exciting, fast-paced drama with lots of twists and turns that roll out effortlessly.  Makes you feel like you are a part of the inner circle of D.C. politics.  Like West Wing, except told through perspective of a highly successful politician instead of through the eyes of staffers
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Let me get this out of the way first. This book is pretty dorky.  If you don't have at least some sort of fondness for video games (probably older ones) and/or D&D you're probably not going to like this book very much.  This book is also heavy on the 80's references so I think it also helped that I was a child of the 80's.<br />That being said I thought this was a fun book.  I got pulled along into the virtual world right along with all the characters it follows.  There is enough action to keep you engaged and enough mystery to keep you guessing.  The characters are liable enough, but the villains are so unlikable that it really helps you root for the heroes.  I really enjoyed the book even if I have to file it under \\"guilty pleasures\\".
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|As a Hip-Hop fan and fan of many types of music, this sophomore debut album is VERY REFRESHING! His lyrical ability places him among the elites in the music industry. J. Cole stays true to himself and his fans, as he delivers content heavy material over creative beats that take you on another story telling journey, one track after the next. I found myself listening to the album, not skipping one song. The blend of the last track and the first track easily transitions you into listening to the album again and again.
B000QCQ9O8|4.0|The story is excellent, the language is beautiful and descriptive, but you have to be patient through the drawn out parts to experience the rest of the story.
1472200322|1.0|It's too late for me...my son swore I'd love this book.  He was wrong and there's an hour I'll never get back. But you, grasshopper...run! Save your money and time for something you'll enjoy.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|It's a cheap indie horror game with no fighting. The goal of the game is simple, you must find eight notes about the Slender Man, all unnervingly demented scrawls. At any time the Slender Man may appear. He does not attack you, but looking at him will drive you crazy. Oh and everything is pitch black, illuminated only by a weak torch. It's a simple premise but one that rapidly becomes incredibly tense and scary, and the fact that the Slender Man himself is so creepy makes it even worse.<br /><br />I was playing it at lunch today at work, and shrieked out loud. Very scary.<br /><br />After playing this awhile, I half expect slender man to pop up in my every day travels. Scary!<br /><br />I do better when I go up the hill to the left from the start point, along the ridge, then run across the street, behind the building, past the fire burning and the road block. That way I get to the last building which is like a maze, where it is easy for Slendy to trap you. This way gives you more safe time in the building because Slendy doesn't start coming after you until you pick up a few pages. So I pick up my first page in the last building, and then backtrack and get the easier ones last. That makes Slendy try to get me out in the open where I can see him.<br /><br />Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you found it helpful in making a purchase decision.
B006ZB3V2C|4.0|I like the many options that are provided for sounds and ambient noise.  But for the life of me, I don't understand how 'white noise' is supposed to be relaxing.  It's nothing but static.  Thankfully, there are many more options, such as a rain, waves, forest sounds, etc.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book has strong themes of patriotism and warfare. Chief Kyle is a true American and a fellow native Texan. His legacy is timeless, and this autobiography helps show the man behind the rifle. This thought provoking view into his personal life helps grant the true honor due this Texas hero.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|i think that this is the funnest game ev-er!<br /><br />and this is just here because. that was all I had to say about the game so this is just to fill in the rest of the words
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I Have never played a greater game!!! you have a real winner !!!! worth every penny of 4.99.  PLease make more of thls calleber. I Could not stop playing tip I finished!!!!!  EVerybody who loves drama and excitement. will truly love this game!!!!!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Enjoy watching the clean drama. It keeps your attention. Appreciate the history.  Great work PBS. keep up the great work.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have really enjoyed this series. It is wonderful to follow the household through changing times.  Can't wait for the next season.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Hey douse anyone know what level you have to be to do the hummingbird race I don't know but I looked at the medals and it brought that up. If you can tell me email be at  grandtorino1980@yahoo.com
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Use this for plugging into a note 2 while away from the car or wall charger.  Works well and lasts a considerable amount of time.  Reliable and a good buy.  At times, the light level can be deceiving as once it comes off full (4 lights), it goes down quicker.  Sort of like a old gas guage on a vehicle.  Would buy again, overall grade A.  Thanks.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|Highly recommended read for those who want a well written, deeply meaningful story.  Have re-read it three times and found new gems each time.
B008QE9XD2|1.0|This film reportedly cost 150 million dollars to make,and made 238 million in box office. The question you should ask while you watch this movie is where did the money go? The movie was so boring I had to hit the skip button three times just to get through it, and for the $1.49 I spent for the rental at the local grocery store, I think I paid too much for this rental. Save yourself some money on this one, and make another selection.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|So much is said and written about A Game of Thrones and A Song of Ice and Fire that I will tell about my reading of the books. I thought I'd never heard about George R.R. Martin when I first read about HBO's TV series on the Web. This was in autumn 2011, and in USA the first season of A Game of Thrones was over, but in Norway, where I live, it hadn't started. When I discovered that all of the four books in A Song of Ice and Fire were among the best-sellers on Amazon, and that fans anxiously awaited A Dance with Dragons, I got curious and bought the four-book bundle for Amazon Kindle for $13.49.<br /><br />And that was it. I felt ambushed, caught in a trap and imprisoned, with no way of escaping. A Saga of Ice and Fire has so many fascinating and complex characters, so many parallel and intertwined plots, so many places and customs, and so much action that I was totally caught. I have never had such a captivating reading experience in my life.<br /><br />Having read A Game of Thrones, the first book, I told myself to take a break. It lasted for two hours. After A Clash of Kings, the second book, I actually managed to escape for a week, but I was captured again. The rest of the books, including A Dance with Dragons which had been released by then, I read at a stretch, using every free minute. And the worst of it is, that the same day I had finished A Dance with Dragons, I started all over again. This time I read a bit slower, studying maps, family relations, religion and and all the rest at the very good wiki at Westeros.org.<br /><br />It was at this time I realized I had read George R.R. Martin before. He has written the introduction to a wonderful book called Meditations on Middle-Earth, in which a lot of fantasy writers, including John Anderson and Terry Pratchett, tell about their reading of J.R.R. Tolkien.<br /><br />In the introduction, Martin is especially preoccupied with how Tolkien changed fantasy: \\"J.R.R. Tolkien was the first to create a fully realized secondary universe, an entire world with its own geography and histories and legends, wholly unconnected to our own, but somehow just as real,\\" he writes. And that is what Martin has done with A Song of Ice and Fire. He has created a fully realized second universe, even richer than Tolkien's.<br /><br />The best article in Mediations on Middle-Earth is \\"How Tolkien Means\\" by Orson Scott Card. He writes about the meaning of novels and the meaning of reading. He mocks the analytic and superfluous reading of academics and critics, who scan for clues at the surface of the text in their search of a deeper meaning. According to Card, the deepest meaning of a novel cannot be found through analysis; it can only be experienced. When you throw away the analytic glasses and dive into the story, live with the characters, feel their joy and pain, hope their hopes, and despair over their fate; that is when you experience the real meaning of a story. The meaning is not on the surface or somewhere else, it is in the story while you're reading.<br /><br />This meaning is created in your imagination and felt in your body; it is what you experience when you are totally captured by what you read. It is exactly the feeling I get when I read A Song of Ice and Fire.condary universe, an entire world with its own geography and histories and legends, wholly unconnected to our own, but somehow just as real,\\" he writes.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love this series. Sylvia Day is an awesome author and I really enjoy reading her books. This series is really easy to get addicted to.
B00ABLJ5NQ|4.0|I floated through this book reading it in one day. The main character - a seven year old boy with no friends - is befriended by the girl at the end of his lane. He is pulled into her world of enchantment.<br /><br />This reminds me of Clive Barker stories but without the depth of horror they have. It gripped from start to finish. And because my son has aspergers I wondered if this bookish main character did too?
B0060AY6FO|3.0|There wasn't enough dialogue between Darcy and Elisabeth.  I was hoping for a sequel that gave us that back and forth banter.  The story focuses on being a mystery that all came neatly together at the end.  Perhaps too neatly.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|There was a couple of things that were challenging but it wasn't that hard. You just have to keep trying things. You definitely need a pen and paper to write things down.
B0030N3O8Y|5.0|Never gets old.  Great Show.  Love The Characters, the conflicts, the drama and the action.  Still the best show around.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Cannot wait for season 4! This is an addicting show that I recommend to anyone...especially all history buffs out there
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great Accomplishment! Great Movie!  Each character has room to develop and shine.  Story is easy to follow and fun throughout it's running time of over 2 hours.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is a fun game totally worth the money I have a whole diamond set of armor and a Simone sword and pickaxe
1623420148|2.0|I am 3 chapters into this & truly want to delete it from my library. So far this is the worst most boring book I've ever suffered through. And yes, it is cheesy from the get go !! I offer 2 stars because I have not read it all yet ( debating if I will )  I hope it gets better, but I honestly doubt it very much.  If it does Get better, I'll follow up
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Any time you decide to read a memoir, especially that of a celebrity, you instinctively wonder how you'll end up relating. With Bossypants, you discover that Tina Fey is as down to earth and relatable as you would imagine. You see that while she has become accustomed to a different lifestyle, she remains fairly unaffected by Hollywood, choosing to spend holidays in the country with the in-laws versus sun bathing at a tropical destination as is with many of the Hollywood elite. Although, as a 22 year old male, there were certain portions of the memoir I could not relate to (how you know you've become a woman; breastfeeding), Tina managed to keep these chapters entertaining. I highly recommend Bossypants. If you can't identify with it at all, you're obviously not human.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|If you are looking for a mind unplug moment with some good entertainment this movie will do it.  Generally total fiction blended with sci-fi.  Lots of explosions and deaths so if you like that stuff your in luck.
B00821PCJS|4.0|Just started watching this show. It is entertaining. Good story line. The people have developed nicely. Always something new surprising us.

B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Lots of fun!  The hint &amp; skip buttons kept it from getting too frustrating. Glad i unlocked the whole game. Will buy more like this from these game makers.
B008Y73940|2.0|I like most of MM's movies but this one was a bore. I liked that I could watch the movie through my kindle by plugging it into my big screen using a hdmi cable though.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|Me and my sister have been waiting since the beginning of this year for this movie. We think it is going to be awesome and really really fun.
B009MYARIK|1.0|I wanted to love this. Seemed like a perfect summer read. But it just fell flat. I never cared about the characters and the story got sillier as it went along.
B004Z8ZFAI|5.0|This movie is really really good. It is so good that yesterday I watched not once but twice. Tonight I am going to have my mother see it. Maybe we will have some popcorn and soda.
B004AM5QT4|4.0|The plot was ingenious and well formulated; the introduction to the &#34;twin&#34; idea in the book was surprising and timely and the book was difficult to lay down.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a very extremely awesome game I love this app it's really fun everyone should get this app don't believe me download it for yourself and see :)
B0050Q3UEM|5.0|If you are a technophile this app is definitely one you want to get.  Great selection of programs with a lot of unique house sets you will not find anywhere else.  I upgraded to the premium channels  and the sound quality is awesome!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game was great and a mental challenge. The most difficult level was 10 and I can't wait until the other level come out.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Honestly, I loved mine craft, but the nether is so boring. And the part why I hate this gAme,<br /><br />I had this huge mansion in survival, and 1 day my kindle broke down and I couldn't replace anything there. I'm trying to save  u kindle users. Take my word
B00D2K40WY|5.0|My niece loves it.  I have not gone all of the way through it yet.  She always takes it from me.  I think she likes to show me how to do those things.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|This is a great Book.  I read the whole book in one sitting! Bourdain's Delivery is full of laughs and stuff you always wondered about the kitchen in the back.
B006N0YWGY|3.0|I don't know what to say.  I am not much of a gamer.  So I may not be the best advice for this.  I find it hard to drive and the airboat goes too fast.  If I can ever learn to drive it I think I would like it.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Two words....Chris Helmsworth<br />Great cast, Story and action. Keeps the franchises going, and expands the movie Marvel universe. Lot of humor!
B00BIQU1K4|5.0|Saw the reviews on this one, and while I am a huge fan of a great deal of Steven's collaborative work (Porcupine Tree, No-Man, Blackfield, Storm Corrosion), his solo efforts thus far have not really resonated with me as much as his other work.  That is not to say I hated Insurgentes or Grace for Drowning, it's just that they pale in comparison to, say, Fear of a Blank Planet or In Absentia.<br /><br />But, as I said, the reviews on this were top-notch, and the price was right (MP3 download for less than $10), so I grabbed it and threw it on my PC and gave it a spin.  And then a second spin, and a third.  And I am writing this review with Drive Home playing in the background.<br /><br />This album is INSANELY good.  I might even have to go out on a limb here and say that this is the best thing Steven has ever recorded, period.  There is a section in each song where I had to stop whatever I was doing and just LISTEN, with my jaw on the floor.<br /><br />Now, this is NOT a happy album.  In fact, it's really freaking DARK.  So, not an album to listen to when you are feeling maudlin.  In fact, I am not afraid to admit it, when I heard the title track the second time, I cried.  Having read up on the song meanings prior to buying (and again while listening to) the album just made it resonate even more.<br /><br />Anyway, if you are even remotely a fan of any of Steven's work, this album is a must-buy.  This might even be considered a desert island disc.  It's that good.
B00ABMZRVO|2.0|Man, this movie was boring. It started out okay, but in the second half it all grinds to a halt. Nothing happens. It'll bore you to death. The other problem is all the stereotypes about gay men. Apparently we're all promiscuous, ready to have sex with any guy sight unseen, and mostly drug addicts. I'm not saying that there aren't people like that, but the movie makes no effort to portray the diversity of the gay man population, which is annoying to me. All in all, a movie you can safely skip.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|And that's all that needs to be said.  Serenity is still flying with her valiant crew (where Wash and Book are still alive) and many adventures are yet to be had.
B002A5WQ8W|4.0|Great music to work by. Brubeck and his crew were masters. Many tunes jazz aficionados will recognize, and Free, too!
B00DGMVJAO|2.0|Contrast was so dark it was really hard. To watch. Story was ok but picture was to dark to watch, so lost interest.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|This book is based on lots of assumptions even if it was written by a physician.  Began with an interesting description of the onset of his illness and ran out of steam.
B00C40DJ1G|4.0|I was a little apprehensive when I picked this up, as I had heard Ted Leonard sing as a part of the High Voltage festival, and wasn't all too sure I would like him doing new material.  I am not an Enchant fan (not that I hate them, just never have heard any of their material), so I don't really have any previous Ted experience.<br /><br />Turns out I needn't have worried.  Vocally, Ted is somewhere between Nick D'Virgilio (low notes) and Daniel Gildenlow of Pain of Salvation (high notes).  The music is the all-over-the-place, sometimes playful, sometimes serious Spock's Beard material that I know and love.  And, to be honest, I thought the two songs cowritten by Neal Morse (Afterthoughts and Waiting for Me) would be my favorites, just because, well, it's Neal!  Writing for SB!  What's not to love?  But they're probably my least favorite of the 7 songs.  Don't get me wrong; they're still fantastic, but the other songs really shine, even the Ted-penned Submerged.<br /><br />I do miss Neal's vocals, and to a lesser degree, Nick's, but I think Ted is more than capable of filling their shoes.  As for the drums, Jimmy Keegan has been their touring drummer for a very long time, and his chops are first rate.  No detectable difference in playing there.  All good.<br /><br />All in all, I'll be looping this one in my iPod, along with Steven Wilson's The Raven That Refused to Sing, for a very long time.  Good work, Beardlings!
1439152802|5.0|As I got further into this novel I had a feeling that there would be a twist. Oh my gosh!  And as I got closer to the end I knew it would make me cry; it did.<br /> I think the author could have gone a little faster with the plot but it was an amazing read. Thank you!
B001RNO7B2|5.0|I knew ahead of time that they ran a little small so I ordered a half sized larger than I normally do.  Very comfortable.  Bought these for hiking while on a cruise to Alaska.
B002XWXPC8|5.0|This movie has aged well.  It is as funny now as it was 20+ years ago.  I forgot the guy who played the president on 24 was in it.
B00985E3UG|5.0|Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us, by Michael Moss is an intriguing and revealing look at the American food industry's history and evolution into the goliath it is today.<br /><br />I expected to read another book about the perils of salt, sugar, and fat in the American diet, but this book was so much more. Michael Moss went to the roots of the issue, beginning with the founding fathers of the food industry, and moving forward with a topical history of the companies producing our food.<br /><br />No one individual set out to make people sick with diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Yet in pursuit of ever more consumption and profit, the food giants addicted their users, (yes, they call consumers users) to their products. Products so loaded with ingredients the average reader can't even pronounce them, that the food becomes unrecognizable as such.<br /><br />I was surprised to find out about various additives in our meat products, (ammonia, anyone?) and what fruit concentrate really is. (If you think it's juice, you're mistaken.) I was not surprised to read how the same areas of the brain that light up with activity when an addict uses drugs are also activated when people eat sugar and fat.<br /><br />The food giants are experts at media messages and manipulation. They developed the most effective ways to convince consumers they are on the public's side of the health battle, and portray their products as healthy and good for us. These deceptive practices are perfect examples for use in any media literacy program. This book shows how children and busy families have been heavily targeted, and how aging baby boomers are the current focus of many advertising efforts. This book is a convincing argument for becoming media literate consumers as well as learning what to eat and what to avoid.<br /><br />Michael Moss interviewed key decision makers and scientists in the food industry, portraying them as people who care about our food and our health. The ones who had enough of the food industry's manipulations got out and moved on to more rewarding careers.<br /><br />These megalithic industry giants control the nation's food supply and therefore, control what many of us eat. The answer for the Davids who are consumers is to sling a rock where it will kill the goliaths, in their profits. Avoid processed foods, even if they claim to be healthy and natural. Trust your gut and your health to the fresh foods in the market, and cook your own meals. It's not convenient, and not as easy as picking up a package, but it's healthier for you. Fast food really does equate to a shorter life, and Salt, Sugar, Fat clearly reports on the scientific support for that opinion.<br /><br />Like Upton Sinclair with his classic book, The Jungle, Michael Moss has revealed the inner machinations of the food giants. I suggest reading this book on an empty stomach.had enough of the food industry's manipulations got out and moved on to more rewarding careers.<br /><br />These megalithic industry giants control the nation's food supply and therefore, control what many of us eat.

B003SI2BL2|3.0|The movie is about a family going through a crisis that has to then face another one.  I guess the movie could have been better - especially in terms of story and character development. If you're thinking about watching with kids- there are a couple of F words and other mild obscenities. Some implied sexual references and infidelity references. It's an ok movie- not awful but not great.
B004ELSDZK|3.0|A fun game for a few minutes, but the floating mask gets annoying really quickly, and there's not really that much to it, is there?  Messed around with for a bit, and glad it was the FAOTD, but wouldn't buy.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|The photography along with the computer generated scenes was pretty amazing! Lots of explosions and bomb bursts. It is non stop action from start to finish. I enjoyed it very much.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Great show. The tech is truly fringe and the twists keep you coming back for more episodes. Well done in every way.
B0073PPKNM|5.0|The first time I heard this (bought the Mp3 album), I was a bit taken aback as it was SO different. Then, I couldn't stop listening to its sophisticated music and gentle vocals. Toe tapping in places, atmospheric in others, it is a beautiful album that marches to its own drummer. Melody Gardot, some professional critic said, has \\"prodigious talent.\\" That is certainly true--and when you also see her live you get a much jazzier feel and extended songs. The albums don't always reflect that. Even so...this is a stone cold winner and she is simply brilliant.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this series and was pleasantly surprised.  This series does a nice job of explaining the intricacies of the politics and personalities of the people involved in this time in history. It did a better than average job of sticking to actual historical facts and not embellishing too much.  I found myself looking things up throughout the series and  was surprised to find how close they were to what I was reading (some minor characters etc. are combined for example).  I found myself very drawn in to the series and couldn't wait to watch the subsequent seasons.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Easy to use &amp; great for when you have time for a quick game.  I like the personalization options as well.
B007MCTTHY|4.0|Enjoyed it one night at the airport while waiting for my red eye.  I used to love pipe dream so this was somewhat familiar to me.  Haven't played it in a while, but it's a fun time waster.  Gets tricky pretty quickly, too.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Honestly, I bought the trio of books for my Kindle account just because it was a good deal. I've watched the first movie before and thought it was good, but I'm going to tell everyone who asks that the books are so much better. It's been a while since I've sat around and just read a book and this way a good way to get back into reading for fun. Now I just have to find something else that keeps me as I the rested as these 3 books did!
B00004WG2F|5.0|had to have this for my collection. classic movie, great story, must have brad pitt movie. great acting, love it
B00915G6WQ|4.0|Be forewarned, don't look at the episode summary pictures on Disc 2, one of them has a spoiler for one of the episodes.  After what happened with the Season 6 discs, Showtime needs to have an actual fan of Dexter assembling the clips for the DVDs.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved the introduction to life in another country.  It became rather tedious to remember who was who; especially when two different characters had the same name (Pari).  Books like these again make me sad that we go to war with folks we know nothing about all in the name of greed.  The book was well written and researched.  Excellent!
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|Don't usually write reviews for apps, but just had too for this one. So many options, you can configure the colors movement, even save the ones you like the best. Got my hubby hooked playing with it one night and didn't see my Kindle for awhile. Cheers
B009LQKHIO|1.0|I saw no evidence that this novel had received the benefit of editing or proof-reading. It was poorly written and full of errors in both grammar and punctuation.  There were inappropriately used words, the repetition of a limited number of adjectives and awkwardly phrased conversations between the characters.  The story did not flow very well and didn't make much sense in some places.  The main characters were uncomfortably drawn and did not seem right for each other.  The weak, confused heroine was not ready for a new romance and the hero apparently had some emotional issues of his own.  His tendencies towards anger, jealousy and a need for control were not too admirable. I couldn't feel much for either of them or their odd, clumsy relationship. This novel is in need of some major restructuring and polishing.  The effort might have been acceptable as the product of a high school writing class, but is certainly not worthy of a professional writer.
B00847KFDS|4.0|John Fogerty is one of the best songwriters of our time, and this set of songs clearly demonstrates this fact. Some of the songs here represent new takes on the classic songs, and are often very good. The Cajun version of Proud Mary with Jennifer Hudson is one of the best songs, Born on the Bayou with Kid Rock is also, perhaps surprisingly, among the best tracks. The title track with Miranda Lambert (and a fantastic guitar solo by Tom Morello) and the My Morning Jacket version of Long As I ... are also really good. Not all the songs work as well, however. The version of Lodi, for example, does not add anything new to an otherwise great song. The insistence on taking turns between Fogerty and the guest vocalist singing alternate verses also comes across as gimmicky and unnecessary. The songs would in most cases have benefited from being sung by only the guest vocalist (or in some cases by Fogerty alone). Maybe for the next album. All in all, it is still very good, though.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I read all three novels. I really enjoyed these books couldn't put them down. Can't wait for more. Please hurry and write....lol
B002FE5XVK|5.0|Excellent show and sound quality. The songs on the video are awesome. Brings you right back to the 80's in Talking Heads' prime of their career. I recommend this video to all Talking heads fans!
0316224588|5.0|I've been tearing my way through the Rebus series since it was first recommended to me a year ago, even though it was quite a few books before I could warm up to Rebus himself (stealing his neighbors' milk off their doorsteps, not to mention getting his girlfriend's cat killed - and worse, failing to own up to it - made him downright loathsome for a long while). Book by book, though, Rebus has worn me down, helped by the increasing brilliance of the writing, the topicality of the Edinburgh references, the welcome addition of Siobhan as object of his affection and respect, and a tightening of the plots. The dialogue has always been wonderful - both natural and witty. As well, Big Ger Cafferty has become such a complex foil that I look forward to his every appearance (and what a relief to find out that Rebus had pounded him back to life after all!). On top of all that, Rebus finally makes it out of Edinburgh and into the far North, though no shifting mountain light will ever appeal to Rebus as much as the glint of a single malt. I was heartily sorry to come to the last page and know that this time there WILL be a long wait for more.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like subway suffers because its addicting and so its not boring the background and scenery changes every month or so this is what kids want to jump over trains and feel the adrenalin rush because hell its fun.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|What is up with the ending?  I thought it left a lot unsaid.  Is there going to be a 4th book?  Usually the reason for the final book is some kind of closure....

B00553U3HM|5.0|Great read. Very interesting with a good storyline. There was plenty of drama and the outcome was unpredictable. All the books I have read by Ken Follett have been well written and educational. I would recommend this book to all who love a good story with an historical connection.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|Was not worth time or money. Glad I watch from home instead of movie theater. I could stop it when I wanted too.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I like it and all but there are some things I don't like. I HAVE TO PAY FOR NUTS!!!!!!!! But its pretty much a good game, i'd recommend getting it
B00BF123WG|2.0|Watching this, one would think that only one analyst in the entire CIA was concerned with tracking down UBL, and she was forced to do it all by herself.  This is no 'Hurt Locker'.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|The actor for Will Graham does a great job, and I like how all the character are represented.  I wasn't happy with Hanniblal's actor at first but he grew on me.  I think my main problem is, I feel he looks to old for where in the time line this seems to take place.  That said, great show.  I give it five stars because no show is perfect but this one deserves as much support as it can get.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Lot of versions for comparing translations.  Good for personal study and sermon prep. Very enjoyable to have all of the versions in hand.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Marvelous recapture of a true genius' trials and tribulations. Perhaps the greatest. tragedy in the whole thing was the loss of the Tesla notebooks. This book is also inspiration for budding innovators. A great -- though brief -- read.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|What can I say; set in another era, period costumes, a peek at how the British aristocracy lives and the servant's lives as well. Beautifully acted, directed, edited and photographed. Maggie Smith as the dowager head of the clan is worth the price alone. I can't recommend it enough. The only people who wouldn't love it are the inhabitants of a &#34;man cave&#34; somewhere.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|I liked the concept of this book and felt interest in the lead character's use of the Language of Flowers but I felt her ongoing reluctance to accept and move on with life a bit much. The ending was so tiresome that I stopped short of the last ten pages. I mean enough!

B007SGM084|2.0|I don't know how they can make a movie of this book.  I read all three and 50%, at least, was sex or emails.  I must admit I couldn't put it down, but that was only because I kept hoping it would get better.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Love David Baldacci and all of his work. The military and all branches of government agencies are so removed from my life experience that David's books gives me a glimpse into a world I would otherwise not know.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|As the subtitle accurately suggests, this book goes through the simple science of building the male body. The reason why I reiterate this is because it is amazing how much bad advice we subconsciously pick up in the fitness world, and how complex the whole thing can become. This book brings us back to those core truths about what is involved in muscle gain and fat loss for men. I found the material to be simple and achievable, well-researched and eye-opening. There are so many key principles in this book which are essential if you want to get your diet and weights program right. I found the author's training plan (CH 18) very effective, and the nutritional guidelines to be very helpful. I ignored the author's advice on taking a break from exercise for a full week every 8-10 weeks of training to my peril, and found myself flat on my back for several days with extreme burn out. The principles in this book are very real! I contacted the author Mike, and he was kind enough to answer my questions and help me move forward. He is a great guy who has the expertise to help others achieve their fitness goals.

These are books I will read more than a few times!!<br />I know many have pushed that the Crossfire series jumped on the Shade of Grey series, but Sylvia is such an exceptional writer, this series grabs you, and you cannot get through it fast enough to get to the next book, and I see opportunities for other books based on characters in this series. (Get on it, Sylvia!! - LOL)
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Some interesting puzzles but I found it way too easy and breezed through the only available levels (10, currently) within minutes. May be a 4 star if there were many more levels. 5 star if it was more challenging. Overall a quick fun game.

Depressing -I don't intend to be exaggerating.still I could not stop reading it, and had to go till the last page. I would not recommend it if you're looking for an easy read.
0316247545|5.0|It's a pretty little book that was way thicker and heavier than I expected. It contains oodles of details about the entire Friendship is Magic series, and it'll definitely make a great gift item for young girls and Bronies/Pegasisters. I'm keeping the copy I bought, though. :D

1576754227|3.0|Mr. Tracy's \\"Eat That Frog\\" is a source for techniques which may help some people organize their creative thinking in a manner which will help them use it more productively.  It is a book which advocates common-sense time management habits.  Some examples are: write checklists of your tasks; start, first thing in your working day, on your hardest task of the day; break all projects down into small, manageable segments.  But this book is an \\"Of Course You Can\\" book: there is little guidance in this book about how to determine why, so far, you haven't used all these so-sensible tips and tricks.  If you could easily accomplish the tips and tricks, you might not be reading this book in the first place.  This book has a place in a collection of books.  Start with Cindy Glovinsky, Judith Kohlberg, Julie Morgenstern, and Gail Blanke, then read Eat that Frog to refine the wisdom you've gained.<br /><br />Lauren Williams.

B00C4GRGQY|5.0|The biggest complaint I've seen about this book is that it is Neil's blog compiled or that the info is too basic. Some of the info is the same, some is an extension of the blog, and some is stuff I've never noticed in the blog. Some of it being in the blog should e seen as a positive..the information is consistent. Almost all of it is expounded upon as well.<br /><br />As far as the info being too basic, I disagree. Sure, the basics are there, but there is much more. Explanations and lighting setups and most importantly..lWHY he does things the way he does! The other neglected part of the basics is that it is amazing that how many people either don't know the basics or dont practice them, and how much their (and my own) photography could e improved by observing these &#34;basics&#34;. The sign of a good teacher is someone who can take a complex subject and break it down so almost anyone can understand it. Neil does one better here, he explains it and gives you the why so you can apply your own variations if you wish, and still know what you're doing! Great, quick read.
B003EYVXUU|1.0|This would have scored a higher rating if not for the remarkable superiority of the original. This American remake does what most American remakes do with a much better filmed foreign original: copies it nearly scene-for-scene, makes a point of removing anything unpalatable to the less sophisticated audience, and ensures the complete absence of any of those tricky, hard-to-read subtitles that so perplex the uneducated. The choice to make the vampire make-up conform to every other Hollywood version was a bad one, it lost all the depth and eeriness that the original had and really seemed to help make this film more two-dimensional than it should have been. After watching the original, I felt compelled to talk to someone about what I was getting from the film and what I thought the relationship really was between the main characters. I feel no such urge here. The script was about the same, but the direction and production choices made the characters as flat as those found in the Twilight series.

B001KVZ6LQ|5.0|I love King Kong and I finally have it in hi-definition<br /><br />The Special features are great<br /><br />It's a shame that young people these days, don't know how to enjoy a black & white movie!<br /><br />Released at the height of the Great Depression, \\"King Kong\\" was the ultimate great escape for audiences. Its greatest legacy is that over seventy years later, it still has that uncanny ability to completely transport the viewer into its fantasy world. This amazing adventure film is still one of the most viscerally exciting spectacles ever made and changed the course of movie history.<br /><br />The stop-motion animation was the most amazing special effects of its day and still hold up pretty well. The amazing sense of spectacle they created have inspired some of the greatest filmmakers of their generations. Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, James Cameron, and Peter Jackson wouldn't have been inspired to make the films they made had Kong not brilliantly paved the way.<br /><br />Aside from the technical innovations, you have a great music score from Max Steiner (who later scored \\"Gone With the Wind\\") that created the template for what movie scoring could do. He paved the way for the likes of John Williams and James Horner. Movie music, too, could be an art, and Steiner was the first to realize that with \\"King Kong.\\"<br /><br />Finally, you have the story, which is so much more than just a B-movie serial. It's amazing to find a special effects film that works on so many complex levels aside from the visuals. On one level this a innovative riff on the classic \\"Beauty and Beast\\" story with screen legend Fay Wray pitch perfect as actress Ann Darrow, the object of Kong's unrequited affections. On another level, this is gentle satire on movie making, with the reckless actions and sense of adventure and spectacle of director Carl Denham mirroring the real life adventures and desires of Kong's producer and co-director, the mythic-sized Merrion C. Cooper. Still, on a third level, this can be seen as a fable about the greatest jungle of them all, modern civilization, brilliantly realized through New York City.

B0062QRTKA|5.0|This is a really cute, fun game. It's not real complicated, and I can play it when I have a few minutes to kill. I like the graphics and music, and hey, it was free, bonus!. I think it's a great little game and have enjoyed playing it..
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is a great way to find people that you have not heard from in a long time. You can keep up with friends, family, co workers, etc. You can also share pictures and all the news. Sometimes I don't always know what the news about things are and then all of a sudden someone has reported that someone has broken out of prison and is in our neighbor hood. It's great!!
B00C0UHGLO|4.0|I like puzzle games so his was right up my alley. The level games help me learn the basics of the game without having to lose over and over before actually being competitive.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Gets my heart pumping!I really enjoy playing this game and its free! I play this and forget what I am suppose to be doing or any problems going on around me for at least 10 minutes. Well worth playing.Fast paced.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|... it isn't working for me right now.<br /><br />I loved this game. All the good things in everyone's reviews? Completely true. It's beautiful, it's engaging, it's clean, it's simple to play, it's a really awesome game. Yes, there are things you need pearls for, but you can earn them. It just takes time. This game requires a degree of patience. I have never had an ad appear, which earns it the only two stars it gets from me right now.<br /><br />But for about the last week, it won't load up. I get a game pop-up that tells me the connection to the server isn't available and to try again later. My internet is working fine, the issue is something with the game. When I can play the game again, I'll give it the five stars it deserves.<br /><br />I have had a problem with it freezing up my fire now and then. Not often enough to make me not want to play or to take away any stars, though!<br /><br />As for the people who call it a &quot;money grab&quot;? Uhhh, hello? Disney. And aren't most games? If it's not &quot;in-game content&quot; then it's ads.
B001MYIXAW|5.0|The Twilight films were crap in terms of writing, acting and direction. Let The Right One In is a Brilliant and sweet film that does not mess up the vampire lore like twilight did with sparkling vampires and gay shirtless pedophile werewolves.<br /><br />This Film Had me so engaged with the main characters Oskar and Elli.<br /><br />This is a must own for any movie collector.<br /><br />Best vampire film ever made!!!

B00CWY76CC|3.0|I like these kinds of apps, but this one got too difficult too quickly. After leven 8 I couldn't figure it out. Great graphics though.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|The tutorial was to difficult to get working. I became very frustrated so I just gave up before spending to much time learning how to play this game.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I am soooooooo addicted to this game,  it is the most fun game ever love it.GET IT!!! its so awesome and its free
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It works perfectly on three of my devices, Mac computer, Iphone, and Kindle fire HD. I can edit it anytime and as it automatically syncs. One problem is that sometimes when I use Skitch (this is another amazing app though), as the page suddenly shut down without saving the data, i have to redo everything again.
0786955570|5.0|This great game have an amazing replay value. The contents are great and price was amazing compared to the one in stores. Part of a great 3 game series.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is a well-written, documented account of one of the Navy SEALs most incredible stories.  Marcus Luttrell brings you into the action while also giving you insights to the rigorous training and history of the Navy SEALs.  Excellent book that I highly recommend reading.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book is good for people of all ages it pulls pulls you into the story line and sets you off on a thrilling adventure

B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Highly addictive and fun game. Good effects and music! I can play this for hours and hours. Although game play is intuitive, it could use instructions.
B00144VBBS|5.0|If you like what is now called Country music I don't see how you van not like Toby. He actually pokes fun at himself in some of his videos and that takes someone who is confident in their position in life.

B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I watched Game of Thrones Season 1 and Season 2 together...I was blown away by the production and cast... Fantastic!
B00025ETIW|4.0|Album is filled with great emotion.. This album got me back into listening to rock music. Gerard sings like no one else.  There's a lot of people who hate this band i think, for no reason?  I don't know. This album also helped with my depression ironically.  If you want a poppy upbeat songs, look elsewhere. This band doesn't sugar coat anything.  And great lyrics.
B00CBRADU2|5.0|it has more depth than a normal Arnold movie. Had  feasible plot, your spectrum of heroes, villians, and love interest, and i love Johnny Knoxville!
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I have this battery pack and a 10000 mAh pack both from Anker.  They charge up and provide a constant supply of power to keep my android phone (Galaxy S4) GPS powered up while I do long bike rides (>5h) with RunKeeper and other GPS apps (Waze) running (screen on) without a problem.  They also work in one of my cats where the cigarette lighter power supply is blown.

B000I3UAJ0|4.0|Star Trek: The Motion Picture is more cerebral than your standard sci fi fare, but it's like comfort food for the soul of a Trekkie imo.
B004PZ4HC8|5.0|I found this to be a great story, very well written and very hard to put down. Brings the human (and political) aspects of a world wide common enemy in clear focus.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|it is a perfect mystery game. it is a great spooky and foggy game.  I love it. there are many mysteries to discover. have fun.
B00005JLCI|5.0|There are many film interpretations of Shakespeare's best-known plays, and you should never depend on seeing a single one to get a good interpretation of the play. Based on watching six different film versions of \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\" I heartily agree with the reviewer who says versions made for film bring the special talents of the cinematographer and editor to bear, which are absent when the film is a record of a stage performance, or directed as if it were being done on the stage.<br /><br />And, since this is Shakespeare's best known play, and perhaps the finest play written in any language, the more versions you see the better. I already mentioned one reason, the added depth achieved by camera close ups and long range views, for recommending this version. A second reason is that this production makes a point of adding every word Shakespeare wrote, even to the point of reconciling different editions to get the best lines. Almost all versions of Shakespeare's plays, and especially Hamlet, are cut down, with one or more sup-plots shrunk or deleted. This does not, which is why it runs to over 4 hours. Added to Shakespeare's words are a number of flashbacks and \\"interpretation\\" scenes which imagine what meaning is lurking behind some of the words spoken on stage.<br /><br />The cast is stupendous. It is the kind of cast usually assembled for such epics as \\"The Longest Day\\" where most characters may be on the screen for about 5 minutes, so they need a familiar face in order for you to remember who that pilot was after he was shot down (Oh yes, that's Richard Burton. He was in the pub scene 90 minutes ago.) Most of the key roles are played by well known Shakespearian specialists, such as Branagh, Derek Jacobi, and Richard Briers. Several of the minor characters are Shakespearean regulars too, like Brian Blessed as the ghost. I especially liked to see Jacobi in a solid, major role, and not as window dressing in the first episodes of costume dramas, to lend weight to the cast.<br /><br />There are also lots of good non-Shakespearean actors in the main rank, especially Julie Christie and Kate Winslet. Among the incidental characters, talent is used with such abandon that one is almost inclined to refer to casting pearls before swine, bot so many of them work to perfection. My favorite is Charlton Heston as the leader of the traveling company of players who performs for the court of Denmark. He plays the role to perfection, and he seems perfectly cast. The other extreme is Jack Lemmon as Marcellus, one of the guards who first spots the ghost during the night watch at Elsinore Castle. It is not a comic role, and you have to look twice to recognize him. He only has two or three short scenes.<br /><br />Speaking of comedy roles (and Shakespeare always manages to include one or two, even in tragedies, there are Billy Crystal as the first gravedigger and Robin Williams as a courtier, who scores the fencing match between Hamlet and Laertes in the last act. Williams seems wasted, but Crystal is pitch perfect.<br /><br />For the first time, I get the sense that Shakespeare's main interest in this play was not justice or revenge, but madness, as two of the main characters either feign madness or actually become mad. And, dare I say it that it seems the most sane character, Polonius, is belittled by all the other characters, then killed, from madness. But an analysis like that is above my Shakespearean pay grade...<br /><br />Which makes me think that almost all actors in this production worked for scale (that is, peanuts).<br /><br />I have seen at least two other productions which are done in bright light, for the camera, and neither can hold a candle to this one. And for all the lights and cinematic expanses, the key speeches come off perfectly.<br /><br />Highly recommended.to the cast.<br /><br />There are also lots of good non-Shakespearean actors in the main rank, especially Julie Christie and Kate Winslet.

B0064MPXFA|5.0|Love how there are twists and turns with the story. Just when you think you have figured out, they turn something to throw you off.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I found this game to be a very fun hidden object/puzzle. Challenging yet not frustrating. Looking forward to the rest of it. Thanks!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Sorry far I am really enjoying this game. I like the sandbox style of this as opposed to the normal version.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|At long last... a solitaire Mahjong that keeps going endlessly ! I love the choices of tile characters and different backgrounds. Each time I play (which is daily) it  feels like a brand new game. Too bad you only have 5 stars because I would give it many more. This is a great choice for anyone who loves Mahjong.
B001UJUGZY|2.0|Take this movie back.  RePossess it.  I like Sara Michelle Gellar.  That's all.  Not that the movie is THAT bad.  but this storyline has been done and redone many times and it's not that frightening to begin with.  It was just plain dull.  But the real problem I have with it is the totally misleading DVD artwork.  You think you are getting a scary movie with some kind of entity or demon to be reckoned with when you see the ghostly face on the cover.  And it alludes to being like THE GRUDGE or THE RING saying that it's from the executive producer of these fright flicks.<br /><br />But what you get is a little weak story of brothers, one good and one bad, who seem to swap spirits after a tragic accident that puts both into a coma.  The bad brother then takes the place of the good one who remains in his coma.  That's it.  You could write the story from there yourself.  While playing pinochle . . . Playing a banjo . . . While singing the Italian opera Nessun Dorma!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Why can't they produce a movie that does not have curse words? They series was fabulous, looking forward to watching more.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Was wonderful. My husband enjoyed it as well .Looking forward to season 3.<br />I feel as though the characters are portrayed realistically.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is very good for when you don't have access to your computer. MCPocketEdition is, basically, Minecraft at an early stage of development. It is rather weird the differences there are between the two. First off, there are very little mobs. Creeper, Skeleton, Zombie, and Spider (not counting ones in the Nether.) Animals are worse. Pigs and Sheep are common with an occasional Cow. Chickens are spawned at random places. There are also only about a 3rd of the blocks from PC version. But, knowing Mojang, they will continuously update it until it's just like what Minecraft is now. It can get pretty addicting after a while. Wonderful for long car trips, or when your computer is occupied. Mojang will will have to work hard to get it up to 1.6 standards, but, it is definitely worth $7.
B0085YOD1A|1.0|it said that I had 54,678,908% left and 30 minutes left it is just unreasonable to have I do not recommend it to anyone else do not buy its just a waste of space and money
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|This is an awesome album for the rejuvenated Queensryche with new singer Todd La Torre.  It's quite a dynamic CD, varying through a range of styles in a compact, potent batch of songs.  The writing credits are just about evenly distributed, resulting in a nice flow between melodic metal, catchy hard rock, and progressive power ballads.  The album boasts well-written songs, melodic guitar harmonies, top-notch rock/metal vocals, standout drumming, and a thunderous bass tone from Eddie Jackson.  The nine traditional songs all clock in somewhere between 3 and 5 minutes, with two minute-long instrumental interludes.  This is one of those short-but-sweet albums that I find myself listening to over and over because it sounds great, but leaves you wanting more.  It's a smart way to start the new era with Todd, delivering a solid, to-the-point album with absolutely no pretension, just a direct focus to embrace a bit of spontaneity and simply rock out.  If you're one of the many who felt for years that Queensryche needed to return to this approach and get back to basics, you should be pleased with the new album.  It has sold far better than their last few releases, as people seem to be getting the word that the band have returned to form.  I was also happy to find a nod to the old-school with the free patch inside the CD I got from FYE.  Nice job all around by a band that looks to have a much brighter future than I would have thought possible just a couple years ago.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|cleans extra stuff of my kindle! Keeps stuff from building up! Love it so much! Use something like this on my pc too.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book is great! I read it in about 2 days because I couldn't put it down. If you're a romance junkie this is the series for you.
B001TW68P4|5.0|This album is a great collection of Flo & Eddie's best music. I recommend it to all 60's Rock fans.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  I liked how the writer made the characters tell what they were thinking. No guessing game. Made the story more realistic.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|People who disliked this book obviously don't &#34;get&#34; Ian Rankin.  I do and I love everything that he writes.  Any book that keeps me from looking at the end or watching the clock is good.  Just because people don't like characters doesn't mean that they aren't real.  John Rebus is real, warts and all.
B00CEJ2H6K|5.0|It's time for a new Amon Amarth album, which basically means you're going to get your teeth kicked in, but always with a classy touch of melody.  We know these guys don't change much, and those of us who are fans love them for that.  Why?  Because they've never failed to deliver riffs that sound old but new, familiar but different, similar but not the same.  While some bands tend to get stale over time when they don't evolve, Amon Amarth just keep producing one excellent album after another.  Every time out, they add a couple of new touches, but nothing that changes the essential sound or style of the band.  For Deceiver of the Gods, they got producer Andy Sneap, who, in my opinion, gave them a more crisp and thrashy sound than their other albums.  Besides that, I'm hearing more Gothenburg on this one than Surtur Rising, making more of it sound like old Amon Amarth to me.  I thought they de-emphasized that angle on Twilight of the Thunder God and Surtur, but it's back on several tracks here.<br /><br />The deluxe edition of this CD also boasts a notable experiment.  The band recorded new original songs for an EP called Under the Influence, but in the styles of Judas Priest, Black Sabbath, Motorhead, and AC/DC.  It could have come out like crap, but these tracks are sticking in my head more than the regular album so far.  They absolutely nailed the core sound of each band, not just musically, but in some cases vocally and even lyrically.  They lyrics, main riff, and chorus of the AC/DC-style song especially replicates the spirit of that band.  I had to Google after I listened to it to see if these were maybe covers of obscure demo songs or something.  These guys have offered just about everything they possibly can on their deluxe editions, so it's cool to see them being innovative and still working to give their fans something extra that actually has value.  Great album, great EP.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't get enough of this show.  I went through a bit of depression after watching the last episode because the season was over.  Love Downton.
B0018OFN2W|5.0|Good story line. You are wrapped in the adventure that you forget your own reality during the length of the movie. That fun entertainment.<br />You also become fond of the characters. Best part-Great car scenes.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I really have to hustle with this cute game.  Easy to play, entertaining and keeps your dexterity challanged. Try it, you'll like it.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|If you are a political wonk, thisis the show for you. Takes you where you want to be to see the grunge side of politics, with a wry twist of humor.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have a ten month old son . We have been having problems keeping him asleep as well as me. I have insomnia . We have been listening to the melody for a few nights now and have both been able to have a full eight hours . This is an excellent program for those who really need to relax before bed time.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I never really got into this one. It never seemed to get anywhere although i was always waiting for the twist
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I do believe at times that I have been to the end of this lane.<br />The telling of this tale is so beautifully done.  The reader is truly<br />better off having journeyed with Mr. Gaiman.
B009AJD5E0|3.0|As a SciFi fan who can spot a &#34;fake&#34; a mile away, Prometheus left me somewhat disappointed.  Although the premise was good and the movie started off fairly strong, the characters turned out to be quite shallow and the second half of the movie was cheesy.<br /><br />In my opinion, this was NOT worth the money I paid to watch it on my Roku.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|I often refer to this gadget.  It helps know what's going on with the wifi.  Easy to use as well.
B003M70O5O|5.0|I watched all five seasons on my Kindle. I really enjoyed this, and can't wait for the next season to start.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game for all ages. My 3 year old grandsons try it and love it. I enjoy it. The only problem is it is very addicting.
B004DM1ZQY|3.0|Dice throws are clearly not entirely random, in that the opponent goes first probably 75 % of the time.  But fun to play and I recommend it as a freebee.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|lots of action!! great movie! you wont be disappointed by this movie!! great characters would watch this movie  over again
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can't wait for the next season to start, this is the best series I have seen on TV in many years.
B00846WWVM|3.0|This looks like it would be a fun thing to do, but It's not a priority, so had to go the give me more room.
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|Crazy good graphics and amazing weapon selection, I love it. So glad it finally came out for kindle fire. Awesome.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|His portrayal of people was good.  this work was not as good as his other books.  not recomended by me.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great series!!!  I do not get tired of these books!!  Every book has been wonderful and I hope there are several more to come!
B00B8R1NP0|1.0|The story was rough and entirely unbelievable.  None of the characters were very well defined, and the thesis was absurd.  A big disappointment.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|If you've ever read a world war two documentary written in the words of people who were there, well, this is a lot like that. It's intelligent, spans the earth, and does a fantastic job of feeling very real while having zombies wander about.<br /><br />I was impressed.
0596805888|4.0|I'm a Geek and I do like cooking, even though my wife doesn't like me going anywhere near the kitchen. When I saw the book Cooking for Geeks, I have to admit to wondering what this could include. Surely this must be a book of Pizza recipes and how to make the best coffee? Indeed there is some talk of how to make the best Pizza but this book is a lot more. The book is by Jeff Potter who is a self-confessed foody and Geek.<br /><br />The book has chapters on sorting out your kitchen to make the best use of the available space, flavours and ingredients, baking, explanations about what happens to food during the process of cooking along with different methods of cooking, with many useful and entertaining facts along the way. Recipes are dotted throughout the book. My kids were especially in favour of the recipe for the best hot chocolate ever and loved helping out making it. Also throughout the book are interviews with members of the Geek community who are also foodies which are very interesting.<br /><br />All in all, I would heartily recommend this book to all your Geek (and non-Geeks) out there. This is well worth a read.<br /><br />You can follow Jeff on Twitter at @cookingforgeeks, or check out the website [...]
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|good book, fun read, for a follower of the series not a stand alone book, so you don't have to read a lot of the same stuff again.<br />not so good - to many loose ends, I wish there was going to be another, even a short book to tie those up.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I work in a law firm, and although this is just a TV show, it is a great portrayal of what happens in corporate law.  It's a great mix of characters and good sub-plots.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I never expected to enjoy this book so much! From the first page to the last, one is drawn in by the characters and when the final page has been read, one closes the book with a smile and a warm feeling that one wants to read it all over again! Most worthy of its five star rating!
B0061S073A|2.0|I did not like that I was unable to put BOOKS on my child's profile on this. Also, some of the games were being forced to close while opened in this App but not wen opened without the App
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Terrific show - every episode is engaging and well produced. Leads grow on  you with every show. Advantage of having discovered only recently - we can watch several in a row and w/o commercials. :).<br />We are up to season 2 episode 8<br />Btw - love the effort made to produce a great 5.1 sound track.<br />Julianna is superb in her understatement... Grows and grows on you...
B00DHRLK84|3.0|First I'm not really a big fan of zombie movies, for which they all seem to ridiculous to me, and this one isn't any different.  I find it hard to believe that a virus turns people into a sort of super human being in 10 seconds, able to leap tall buildings with a single bound, etc, etc, etc...<br /><br />Once I get past the part where I shut down my reasoning, then this is a decent action movie.  Nothing special.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I saw the ratings and thought I had to try it and not sure of what I was getting myself into. Well I finished level 10 and enjoyed each one. Each level was more difficult than the previous one. Now I want more and a higher level of complexity. If you are looking for a little challenge to your brain you will enjoy this.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|By trial and error, I was able to get to the second level but that's it. I got frustrated and quit the game. This game was not fun for me.
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|First, all 5 Stars aren't created equal. So although I give it a 5 star, it is based on the fact that I believe it is among the best debut albums that I have heard, not that it is among the best albums of all time. When I purchased the CD 3 months ago, my immediate favorites were Two Fingers, Seen It All & Simple As This; but after listening to the album just a handful of times, I liked the entire album, although, I'm not too crazy about the gimmicky audio of &#34;Fire&#34;. Having purchased other albums since then, I still listen to this one much more often that any of the others. I highly recommended it, as it is &#34;differently good&#34;, compared to almost anything else in current popular music. Hopefully he will follow it up soon with another album just as good, or better. Thanks, Jake...
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I thought it wasn't too bad. I didn't mind getting to know a few of the other characters a little more in depth. Not as good as the other 2
B00CL6HGIK|1.0|So cliche! $50 mil to make this movie that has been done a dozen times before for 10% of that cost. Acting is second rate, action is so very staged, and plot is just much too predictable.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love the scenery, acting & characters on this show. Recommend for all ages tp enjoy. So excited to discover the series!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I didn't think I'd like the series, but my entire family kept nagging at me to watch. Well, I gave in and watched every single episode in three marathon viewings.  I can't tell you which character I like, or dislike, the most--and I won't give away the storyline.  Suffice to say, however, every one of them is engaging, each in his/her own way.  Elizabeth McGovern does a beautiful job, but the British cast is just PHENOMENAL!  I really suggest you give the series a go.  You have until January, 2014, to see all the episodes...and then to get ready for Season Three.  Get going!
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|I love to fall asleep to the relaxing sounds sounds of this app. It is very customizable. Rain, waves, birds, etc.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Another great season. The characters become real and I can't wait to see what will happen next. Very well done!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I've finished watching Season 1 and just started on Season 2.  GREAT series... sure shows what women sometimes put up with to keep a family together!
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|The subject matter never caught my attention before but once it got going it was a nice taught thriller. The bad guy was a little too identifiable early on but beyond that a nice evening's entertainment.
B005LAIIN0|4.0|From the opening to the end this movie was good and I enjoyed it. The Bradster could not catch a break lol, those zombies was on crack after them but surprisingly they didn't eat bodies up like typical zombies. Meh, good flick in all though!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I thought their were amazing graphics in this game. I thought it was<br />really ininteresting the second I started playing. I play for a few hours a day and it was really cool from the start. *intresting. Sory i said the wrong thing.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Now we are glued to this series, and ration ourselves to just one episode per night so we don't run out sooner than we have to.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|How did I miss this show? Phenomenal. I watched 2 seasons in two weeks as I just couldn't stop.  The story lines for a legal drama show are unprecedented.
B00CDPP9X8|5.0|This books wraps me up and takes me inside the covers to experience English history as it was then .Wonderful.
B0096HL33G|2.0|I don't mind a good story told in non-contiguous segments like Pulp Fiction or Memento. But this movie never gave you enough information about how Rachel Weisz's character met and became involved with the former RAF pilot to help the audience understand and sympathize with her choices.  She just became a sad person who attempted suicide multiple times. It makes you wonder if added material obviously left on the cutting room floor would have made the story more coherent.
145210655X|5.0|I bought this book for my husband from our son for his first Father's Day. Hubby is a big Star Wars fan and just thought this was hilarious. There are a lot of inside jokes in the book, too, (which of course I didn't get) and hubby really enjoyed it.
B00181JGI2|4.0|The Dude's performance was a classic, &#34;the truth is often time encountered, but not perceived!&#34; I like the movie, look forward to a sequel.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|I got this album primarily for the &#34;Master of Shadows&#34; track (if you only get one, that's the best one IMHO :), but the entire album is filled with many good, inspiring tracks. Put the album on when exercising :)
B000FBFML6|5.0|A fool and his or her catalyst change the world. Fool and fitz continue their journey, an adventurous saga continues
B0045INOCO|5.0|Great action and storyline. A little heavy on the romance(I skip over) I purchased the next two books and can't wait to read them.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Hooked from the very first episode of season 1, this season wrapped up a few things very nicely. Love this show
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|This is a sweet movie with some funny one-liners. It tells of a villain whose heart is melted by three little girls while he's trying to accomplish his latest evil plan. The antics of the minions, reminiscent of the Oompa Loompas of &#34;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,&#34; add to this film's charm. Steve Carrell does a great job voicing main character Gru. Cute, family-friendly movie! Looking forward to the second installment.
B00CATSONE|1.0|I'm sorry.  This book was free.  I tried to read it twice.  It just isn't interesting.  Free is exactly what it is worth.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I finished this book in less than 24 hours. Just was hard to put down. The darkness and illness in this story takes you to a place where you really start thinking about the characters and if they were capable of the crimes described in the book. Amma was delightfully wicked and her personality was well developed by the author. A very easy, engaging, captivating, and suspenseful read.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|With the kindle book I also bought the audio narration and I have to say it was amazing! It's a whole new experience to read and listen to the voice of the actors at the same time
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|It's a Black Sabbath reunion of sorts and I couldn't be happier. I've always preferred Ozzy's contribution to the band over any of the other vocalists, so this is a huge treat for me. It's been 18 years since we've received a new studio album from the group, 35 years since Ozzy was on vocals, and 19 years since Geezer Butler was on bass. Unfortunately, it's not a total reunion because Bill Ward is absent due to \\"contractual disputes\\". In his place we have Brad Wilk from Rage Against the Machine. Now I hadn't heard any of the new material until the album came out. \\"God Is Dead?\\" was released a few months back, but I apparently missed the memo. So I went into this album completely blind (deaf?) and I must say that 13 surprised me in the best way possible.<br /><br />What I loved so much about this album is its variety. Throughout this album's 53 minute running time you'll get to hear some new, flashy music while at the same time hearing songs that feel very reminiscent of their past work. One of the best examples of this would be track seven, \\"Damaged Soul\\". Hands down my favorite song on 13, \\"Damaged Soul\\" sounds like something taken straight off of their debut album. The way the song is structured, the amount of focus put on the instruments, the atmosphere it creates, everything. It's just a blast from the past and it's awesome. I knew from the first time I heard it that it was going to be my favorite track.<br /><br />Not all of the music relies on their old formulas, however. Two songs in particular feel a little more modern when compared to the rest of the tracklist. These two songs would be track three, \\"Loner\\" and track six, \\"Live Forever\\". While both of these are solid songs, they do feel a little out of place given the general sound found on majority of the album. They're also the biggest contributors to one of the album's biggest flaws which is how it was mastered, but I'll get into later. Still, they're nice songs in their own right and I'm finding \\"Live Forever\\" to be extremely addicting.<br /><br />The album isn't without it's faults, though. As a whole I felt Ozzy's performance was a little inconsistent; both in his lyrics and his vocal delivery. At times the lyrics became a little corny, random, and, in some cases, predictable. It isn't a common occurrence, but I would have a hard time saying that any of these songs are lyrically perfect. Now my complaints with his delivery are kind of difficult to articulate. Personally, I felt that he didn't sing as much as he should have. He used that stop and go delivery that he's always had, but he didn't use it as well as he has in his past. He seemed to take longer pauses which left some of the verses only lasting four to six lines. I don't know, it was just weird to me.<br /><br />Finally, the instrumentation provided by Iommi, Butler, and Wilk is phenomenal. Iommi in particular seemed to steal the show on majority of the album. His acoustic performance on \\"Zeitgeist\\" was fantastic and his solo on \\"Damaged Soul\\" was equally amazing. With that said, the way his guitar was mastered makes it a pain to listen to on some of the more energetic performances. As many critics have said, the way the album was produced makes the guitar too loud. In the end, the high-tempo songs suffer because of it because the guitar becomes overwhelming and drowns out Butler and Wilk. In fact, I was unable to hear Butler at all on majority of track five, \\"Age of Reason\\".<br /><br />On top of the eight songs found on the main album, there are four bonus songs you can acquire. Three of these four can be found on the deluxe edition, while \\"Naïveté in Black\\" is a Best Buy exclusive. While I did enjoy the extra music, none of these songs are necessarily essential to the experience. \\"Methademic\\" is probably the standout of the group because it contributes the most to the sound found on the main album; \\"Peace of Mind\\" is nice, but it sounds like something more fitting for an Ozzy album; I loved the instrumentation on \\"Pariah\\", but I wasn't a fan of the predictable lyrics; and \\"Naïveté in Black\\" is good, but it doesn't fit with the core sound of the album. They're a nice addition if you're fiending for more, but, as I said, they're not essential.<br /><br />Standout Songs: \\"Damaged Soul\\" & \\"Dear Father\\"<br /><br />Overall Score: 8/10 - While 13 may be flawed, I would be lying if I said I wasn't loving it. It's strong, it's confident, and they were able to bring back that classic sound on some of the songs. I was trying to go in with low expectations because it's been so long and because of this I wound up enjoying every minute of it. Definitely recommend you give this a listen.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a really cool app. I love I t so much because,I like mysteries a lot. I can do one in a minute.get the app!
B003UESJ9M|5.0|Im a big fan of Tim McGraw so this movie is amazing and so is his performance in it. The singing is great by everyone. LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie.
0743270754|5.0|A Great Read. Author Keep you up on Characters, So When you were reading later in book you were able to remember where they fit in the story. If you haven't read much Lincoln before.Read This book.
B005KAH7QU|3.0|Hanna is a lot of gunfire and fights. It is exactly what you think it is. We have two particularly nasty bad guys( or gals)  and a super hero who is pretty invincible until the end. It's a pleasant diversion .
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Easy quick delivery per usual. Great set to buy for the price, get the Blu-Ray and DVD Version, the ability to stream it anywhere with internet, and a digital copy. I think I have too many ways to view it!
B00CATSONE|5.0|Tesla had a mention in our study of the history of technology.  I am glad this story is available and have shared it with Middle School students.  Genius sprouts all over the world.and in every era but  I hope it is more appreciated and encouraged in our time.The character of the man is an additional inspiration.
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|When this mic works, the quality is solid, especially for a &#60; $20 item.<br /><br />The problem is that it sometime (randomly) doesn't work.  I have found that I have to completely power down my laptop, connect the mic (with it turned off), power up the laptop, etc. to get it to work.  Pretty annoying.<br /><br />But like I said, if this mic cost any more than $20 I would have been upset.  But at this price point...meh...
B002WV5A9G|4.0|It's a great, fun sci-fi movie with a lot of action and killer special effects! I really, really recommend it.
B00DGQF0K0|4.0|I enjoyed playing this game. The music could be better, and it would be nice if they would change the music for each floor.  The game could be a bit more challenging, but overall it is a fun game to play.
B006IGZX0C|5.0|Emma Stone and the maids are so true to life for me. Had black nanny's raise me and after many years of loving them as family, I was filled with sadness and remorse for the way they were treated outside our home. God Bless Ruby and Ruth!
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Great product for the price. Works well and comes with all the necessary accessories. Don't bother looking anywhere else for a portable amplifier.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is the best and this is alot better than survial craft i tried both of them and survialcraft sucks
B004W1GCNC|4.0|Compared to Downton Abbey, Upstairs Downstairs is good. Had I not seen Downton Abbey I probably would have rated Upstairs Downstairs with top ratings.  It is however hard to not compare the two shows.<br /><br />Still very enjoyable and it certainly is far above the reality trash that is so prevalent on most TV  stations.
B000IAZ5HK|5.0|I have several dressing shakers (i make all my own salad dressings) this is a nice size for a salad for 4 - 8 humans and is attractive enough to serve when entertaining. Love the glass, sturdy, tight seal.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Finally, a plot could follow. Good bad guy with Javier B. Fun movie.  can't think of anything else at this time
B0064MGU98|4.0|Nothing like Law and Order except for the law part. I am able to make time fly with a few episodes and feel good about life after?
B00D6BU8GG|1.0|Not sure what I was expecting but this is an absolute stink-bomb of of a movie.  No plot, extremely slow moving, and for crying out loud - could they add any more slow-motion to drag it out any further?  Please do yourself a favor and pass on this one.  I'd give it zero stars but that's not an option...
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Sealed play adds a great dimension to the game, though I wish there was an easier way to either add slots without paying, or erase your packs once you finished the campaign.<br /><br />This game, for me, is a great way to clear you mind before you go to sleep in the evening.  Relax, play some magic, unwind.
B00CATSONE|3.0|Just okay.  I was hoping for more in depth information of the man himself. Just too many facts and little background..
B008220DGE|1.0|I was certain that any movie with Hoffman would be great.  His acting was outstanding, but the movie was pitiful and just plain weird.  Amy Adams was miscast and as far as Phoenix, I will never again watch a movie in which he is cast.  The story was strange and I tried to find sense in it, but finally gave up.  I did watch it through to the end hoping it would improve, but it just kept sinking.
B00001OH7Y|4.0|It's certainly in my collection of Bowie and, I'm very picky about the Bowie I listen to. Not exactly his best but, great for a first time buyer of Bowie just for the simple fact of the tracks \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" and the title track \\"Scary Monsters\\" there's also the well played radio and M.T.V. video and song \\"Fashion\\" on this album. Oh no,I think I just dated myself. But for the best and most likely unknown Bowie listen to \\"Oh By Gingo\\",very very interesting but ,then again most of his albums are truly interesting and, the man is a musical genius from start to finish.
B005HSL626|2.0|Well, Fruit Ninja is a classic, but I don't really like it. Kinda boring. Easy to play, though, so kids would like it. I don't like the ads, though. Once you get a \\"game over\\" the screen stays on an advertisement. When you get a \\"game over,\\" it should go back to the \\"start\\" screen.<br /><br />Overall- meh.
B00821OX98|3.0|This show is a decent watch if you have time to kill or are cleaning your place and need to have the TV on. The characters are quite predictable and their slow development can sometimes be annoying. Not a bad show or bad acting just not a great story.
B00B5P37IG|1.0|Very misleading.  Thought I would be able to see at least a few of the news channels.  Very dissatisfied.  I do like the religous stations however.  And being able to view news in other countries is interesting.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Very well written-the interviews draw you in with the realism- many things are brought out that you would never think of in an &#34;apocalypse&#34; - a serious world wide epidemic of any kind.<br /><br />As per usual the book was much better than the movie.
B004UXUUDA|3.0|Really loved the book but I didn't think the movie really captured this compelling tale that moves between the past and present.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game I mean it's fantastic & asome and the graphics are cool and 3D the Alfits are cool.
B005N09L5C|3.0|It was rather difficult to watch this movie because in some ways I felt that the current state of our country mimics this movie.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|This continuation of Lee Child's Jack Reacher series shows that the characterization and plot lines are becoming formulaic. We learn nothing new about the character, and he does not seem to evolve in any way. It seemed longer than it needed to be and resolved the plot too neatly leaving a few details unanswered.
1582701709|5.0|If you are in search of help and positive influences in your life then you found it here.  It can only be found one place and you need this book to find it.  I have read it twice and will be venturing my third soon.  I get something new every time I read it and grow every day.
B001O96JC4|4.0|A well audited performance. Budgetary will leave you wanting more. A must see production before someone rates it. What can I say?
B00C81LYH2|5.0|This Barbie is very well detailed, right down to the nail polish!  This doll comes with a stand, which is very easy to remove if you want.  Even the box that this comes in is really nice.  Being that my daughter loves to play with Barbies, keeping it in the box, isn't going to happen.  But, still, this doll is very well made and is worthy of any collection.  The only thing is that the arms are not fully articulated.  So, only the shoulders you can move the arms.  The elbows and wrists are stationary.  If this is a problem, just know that being that it is a collector doll, it may be for display only.  But, if your daughter doesn't mind, then cool.  Either way, this doll is really nice.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|At first, I was angry at myself for giving in to the lure of this book, brought on by rave reviews by others.  Based in Afghanistan, and probably accurate in its descriptions, names, and storyline, it was very hard for me to follow at first.  I couldn't get the foreign names straight, and felt almost hostile to the characters.  However, as it moved along, and wove its tale that covers several decades, I was enthralled.  It is very deep, its message meaningful, and I really loved it.  Prepare to immerse yourself in the beauty of the prose, and the emotions of the characters.  It's worth the effort.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Always a few degrees off, and stop trying to sell me stuff. If need it, will ask for it. Thank you.
B00D02Z1EA|4.0|Great album by August Burns Red. You can feel the passion and the guitar work is just top notch. Great cd. Best of all some really SICK breakdowns!
B003DNH6DK|3.0|The blindside is a good ole fashion family film suitable for all ages with a great message to boot. The dialogue and story are fairly predictable and I thought the film was a bit overrated. While still good, I didn't get all the hype over Sandra Bullock's performance. That being said, its still an enjoyable film.
B002WD4MLG|3.0|Like all sequels Get Shorty reminded me of Be Cool. The characters were the same save for Danny Divito' s role. Although he played in both movies John Travolta gave a remarkable performance as did everyone else.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|Doesn't download on Kindle. Needs to be fixed, all the one star reviews are kindle owners. Big magic fan and this is upsetting so please fix this.
B009AJD5E0|4.0|Thinking about finding our creator has been done before. This twist was chilling, frightening and scary to think about. Would have liked to have seen more of the aliens tho. Otherwise, would have givin it 5 stars!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Don't like my friend list being broken up into categories. If I want categories,I'll make my own thank you. Now how do I undo your mess and restore my page to MY preference?
B00821OX98|5.0|I'm a sucker for post-apocalyptic shows and movies, so I may be somewhat biased. However, &#34;Falling Skies&#34; takes a fanciful premise (alien invasion) and supports it with epic themes, engaging characters who develop over time, a well-thought-out story arc, and suspenseful episodes punctuated with action.
B00B19GKI0|5.0|This is a great movie to see cause it gives you a look see into what you might have in store if it ever happens.
B00005JPS8|5.0|Purchased the 2 disc dvd edition. Was shipped quickly, and was New/English as stated.<br /><br />Overall great movie, even for someone like me who had no idea who Iron Man was before watching it.<br /><br />3 year old nephew got bored during the beginning part, but once the suit was created, he got into the movie and is now obsessed with Iron Man.<br /><br />I watched all the extras as well, there were so many! I was surprised, and spent hours watching all the extras. I loved it.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I've read all the books, burned through them in fact and I also love True Blood.  The books are special and I appreciate the adventure Charlaine Harris has taken us on and am glad she brought it back to reality for the end.<br /><br />>>>>> SPOILER ALERT <<<<<<br /><br />Since this book has been out for awhile I don't feel too bad talking about the ending now.  I know people are very upset but you have to think realistically for this story to have a happy ending.  Sookie had had a fairly normal boring even an outcast sort of life.  She always dreamed of having babies and getting to be a grandma herself.  She got swept up into an exciting adventurous life with her first love Bill.  But look at what she sacrificed and went through for him as well as her other supernatural lovers and ultimately for Eric!  She suffered, would have died several times if it wasn't for them but she also loved fully and felt loved.  BUT even with vampires, marriage only lasts 100-200 yrs...  She would have lost their interest when she aged, she never would have had babies and they would've ended up taking care of her in her old age or turning her against her will.  Sookie would have known as she became 60, 70, 80 that Eric was only taking care of her out of obligation and think of how lonely she would have become!  IF she made it into old age with all the bickering, jealousy and fighting going on in vampire-land because really what else do they have going on for eternity?<br /><br />Sookie came out with the best she could from those relationships but still truly longed for a normal life which she wouldn't ever have had with Eric or Bill.  She gets to have that with Sam!  No I don't believe the cluviel dor changed Sam & Sookie or magically made them want each other!  I think the death experience was a slap in the face to both of them & it got both thinking about what they really wanted out of life and what really mattered!  For Sookie is was the sun, children and a family around her.  It also made her realize how she really felt about Sam.  For Sam it was more along the lines of how much he's always cared for Sookie & why hasn't he EVER done anything about it?  What was he waiting for?  And that gave him something to really think about.<br /><br />I applaud Charlaine Harris for sticking to HER story and not letting fans and the hype of the show, change the story she wanted to tell.  She kept it real and hopefully some young girl will stop looking at that bad boy and realize they really don't want a hard time but a good life with a good man who will love and look after them and grow old together with their kids and grandkids all around them.  And really it all comes down to family and just being happy and loved.<br /><br />Thank you Charlaine for the wonderful characters and a story I got to be a part of for a time.
1574214276|3.0|The book is OK but on page 11 the author asks that \\"if you are creating and selling Zentangle art or ZIAs please include the copyright symbol after the word Zentagle for traditional Zentangle art, and \\"Inspired by the Zentangle method of pattern drawing\\" I find copyrighting an idea about doodling is absurd. I am offended by the idea that you have to spend a inflated price for \\"tiles\\" when people have been doodling on any kind of paper for ages. I think they kind of take the fun out of the process.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Like the app. Organizes well. Little clunky when it comes to pasting in text from another source (formatting from original source is retained, can't override easily) and editing previously created notes is a little clunky as well.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I thought this book was great. An easy read that at times kept me wanting to finish the next chapter before bed. What made this book so good was its real world setting, and not bogging us down with magical details and big fancy made-up words. I loved how it evoked many childhood memories as well. Great book.
B004UFEJVW|5.0|Was New/English as stated, and shipped quickly. I purchased the 3 disc bluray/dvd combo.<br /><br />This movie was amazing. There were a ton of extras as well so you could see how they made the movie, including alot of footage from their research trip to South America.<br /><br />I've watched it several times with my nephews and it never gets boring/old for me. I love it.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I was reading this for a &#34;book club&#34; with my friends and before I even started the book I felt a little obligated to read it. I read many of the reviews and was considering asking for another book for us all to read. There were a lot of people who complained that it went in too many directions and was hard to follow. Yes it is true Khaled Hosseini brings in a lot of perspectives but I found that intriguing while I was reading because each story tied in some how to a larger story, each character fit together some how with another character. Once I read it for myself, I found I couldn't put it down wanting to find the connection from the chapter I was reading to the other stories I had previously read. It wasn't as gut wrenching as A Thousand Splendid Suns, but still had many parts that had me tearing up. Good read.
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|Love season 2! Good to see Mike, Harvey and Jessica be challenged Vs Season 1 where they used to win all the time.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|First I'll say I'm shocked to see the number of 2-3 star reviews for this album.  Each person's entitled to their opinion but star ratings are relative and relative to rock/pop albums Living Things is definitely a 4-5 star creation.  I've yet to read a well reasoned, well written review which coherently explains a 2-3 star review.  For that reason, I won't be adding much substance to my 5-star review :)<br /><br />That said, I would have given this 4.5 stars if I could have.  They brought their harder, darker sounds back & I'm glad there's a little more rap here than in Minutes to Midnight (which was pretty lame in my opinion).  Their experimentation with electronica and deep basses reminds me a bit of Beastie Boys' Hot Sauce Committee Part II.  The lyrics are somewhat more thoughtful than previous albums.  I wonder if they had help this time around.<br /><br />In the end, Living Things is classic Linking Park.  A bit of a departure from Hybrid Theory & Meteora but nonetheless an exciting listen.  Certainly worth the money.
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|I'm not sure why this is a Die Hard movie. It was a mediocre action movie that for some inexplicable reason had John McClane in it. Almost as if they wanted another Die Hard movie and someone said, &#34;We have this old action movie script, let's just write him in!&#34;
B0053O89WY|4.0|Was New/English as stated and shipped quickly.<br /><br />I am obsessed with this show, but it seems the bonus features on the dvds are lacking, or maybe I'm used to movies with lots of bonus features and tv shows don't have as many? Some of the dvds in each season have no bonuses at all, and others have 2 bonuses.<br /><br />None of the bonuses are very in-depth with the cast. It seems to be mostly crew stuff with a tiny bit of cast. While the bonuses are interesting, they aren't that amazing.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I've actually thoroughly enjoyed this game.  It can be challenging and I have to admit that I've had to put it down and come back to solve certain problems.  That said, so far I've been able to keep advancing.  It's well thought out and presents just the right amount of challenge to keep things interesting.<br /><br />The only thing I might change, would be to give a bit more direction initially.  I had not played a game in this format before so what I needed to do wasn't quite as obvious to me as someone else.  Obviously, I figured it out, so I don't know that it's that big of a deal.<br /><br />Overall, I really like the game.  It's well thought out, the graphics are nice and the ads are noticeable but not in the way.  Good job!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I couldn't put it down! This is the best series I have read in a long time. The story is rich and deep. The characters grow and change. I can't wait to read the next book!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Five stars!  One book that kept getting better with each turning of the page. Characters so full of life that you weep with them and morn their loss. George Martin is a master storyteller.
B00821OX98|5.0|I watched an episode due to an ad on the Prime landing page and was instantly hooked. The story is more about the people than the aliens, but the scifi aspect keeps you interested.
B004UFEJXK|5.0|I purchased the 3 disc bluray/dvd combo. Was New/English as stated and shipped quickly.<br /><br />I've watched alot of movies of all varieties, and I have to say this is my favorite movie of all time.<br /><br />I'm not going to fully review the movie because that's what IMDB and wiki are for.<br /><br />My 3 and 2 year old nephews love this movie as well, even though for a majority of the movie there is no speech, only action/sounds. It has a very important message in it, but it's not over the top to the point where it would be considered annoying.<br /><br />There were alot of extras that were amazing as well. They put in so much work into this movie, and I am glad they showed so much of the process.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was recommended to me and I was told it would take a little bit to get into it&#34;. I was engrossed from page one but 1/2 way through the book the twist happens (which some may see coming) and then they just keep happening and you don't want to put the book down not even being able to begin to guess how this will end.
0345803493|5.0|Ok, I honestly don't know where to begin. I thought the first one was a trip but this one right here, was really a trip. I know this series is mostly known for its erotic escapades and while they are alive and well in this book, you can't overlook a great storyline. Yes, the sex scenes get hot and steamy but I enjoyed the suspense of it all a little bit more. I liked this book better than the first one because there was more flavor and substance to the plot and the characters, which made you understand \\"50 shades\\" himself a little better. It just takes you through so many ups and downs to the point that you don't know what's coming next. Such an unpredictable book, I loved it!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This is a great game.... not that hard that you get flustered.  My 10 year old can play it as well.  Recommend this game.....
B0059WTMLW|1.0|Too confusing.  I like the regular one better.  It is much easier and quicker.  I only tried the colored one and couldn't figure it out.  Might try again some other day.
B005AUWY90|3.0|Was brand new/sealed as stated, shipped quickly, and was in English, so I was happy.<br />Even though I love the first movie (and almost all things Pixar), and my nephews loved the first movie, none of us could really get into this one.<br />They are 3 and 2, but they normally can sit through Cars entirely without moving except for food/drink/bathroom.<br />The three of us got bored not too far into it and never finished it. I plan to try to push through it to the end, maybe it gets better?
B008035H16|5.0|Great read - and quick too!  Very inspiring and shows what happens within a company when you hold strong to your culture/values!
B0064MGU98|4.0|Four stars because I like Julianna Margulies who plays the part of Alicia Florek and is, as far as I can see, one of only two likeable characters in the series - the other being Archie Panjabi's fascinating Kalinda Sharma, easily the most enigmatic and compelling character in the cast. Otherwise, as usual, the legal profession is portrayed here as a conglomeration of scheming, unprincipled, devious, and mostly contemptible people, including members of the judiciary. It is salvaged only by Margulies and Panjabi, but particularly Margulies, whose Alicia seems to have all the admirable qualities everyone else lacks, and she and the mysterious Panjabi play their characters so well that I have stuck with it despite all my other negative feelings toward the characters and the plots. These two (and only these two) succeed in making you actually care what happens to their characters, the sine qua non of television drama success.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Although we all know how this book ends, as well as many of the facts in the middle, it will keep you up all night turning page after page.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I thought there was something missing at the end of the book.other than that it was the best out of the three books.
B003L77NL8|5.0|Was brand new/sealed as stated, shipped quickly, and was in English, so I was happy.<br />Movie itself is only good if you've seen the previous ones, otherwise you probably won't like it.
B00D41H2PS|3.0|Nice game but I had to delete and reinstall to get the boat game to work. I had the right doors closed but yhr game didn't recognize it. Then again I had to delete and reinstall because the last item needed to win tgr game disappeared from my inventory. Too much trouble. Took longer to install all 3 times than it took to play the game itself.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|my 11yr old son and I really enjoyed this game.  it was frustrating at times but really made you think.  I have to admit to using a cheat just once in level 6...that daggone pyramid!  I still don't know WHY that was the answer LOL!  highly recommend this game and hope they come out with more levels soon!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Good book, definitely worth the read. Interesting take on the war on terrorism. To hear him talk in this book, he may have redefined a sniper's role in modern warfare.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Pretty good but I wish it was longer than that. Oh and excellent details! I completely loved the creep factor
B004KIMLT6|5.0|Was New/English as stated and shipped quickly.<br /><br />I have seen this so many times I can probably recite the script word for word by now. Each time I watch it, I notice things I didn't notice before. It's amazing how many details are in every scene.<br /><br />There are alot of extras as well, so you can see how much work they put into this movie and how precise they wanted everything to be, including recording the real &#34;doc&#34; car starting its engine for the race scene.<br /><br />Both my nephews love this and watch it frequently; they are 3 and 2. The 2 year old is fascinated with real cars, so it's doubly amazing for him. But I've never been too into real cars, and I loved this movie.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is amazing!!!!!! I've read it about a million times. I can read it, about twice in one day. I love the series. Thank you for writing such great books, Jeff Kinney, and I hope to read mire amazing books, from you!!!!!! Thank You!!!!!
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is a definite book for those who like to lose themselves in the ultimate fantasy!  Looking forward to more books by this author
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can't wait for the next season to come out! I never watched this show before now and now that I have it is driving me crazy that it is not on!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Not much  can be said that  could do this book justice! It's a must read for anyone--one that won't regretted!!
B0043RSE2M|5.0|I purchased the 3d bluray/dvd combo. It was New/English as stated and shipped quickly.<br /><br />When the previews for this first were being shown, I thought it was going to be lame. Some online friends told me it was great, and I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />I've seen it so many times I can almost recite the script word for word. It isn't just targeted at kids.<br /><br />This set included a bonus feature that allows you to let the minions/gru take control over the movie, and it adds more humor and fun to the watching experience, but I recommend using that bonus feature for future viewings and not for the first viewing.<br /><br />The minions and the youngest girl are the best parts of the movie for me but there are alot of funny parts.<br /><br />It's so FLUFFY!!!!!!
B008YW5RH2|4.0|Great tennis game for all tennis fans.  I like how you can choose from so many pros to play as.  Five stars if there weren't so many in game purchases.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|I think it was a little slow.  I had a hard time staying interested in it.  Was a good storyline
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is the one of the best books that I have ever read. It was a very adventurous book and I think that lots of people would really enjoy it too.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|I enjoy this on my Kindle as well as on my desktop.  It's a very good way to spend time that I ought to be using for reading.
B002BWP49M|5.0|Was brand new/sealed as stated, shipped quickly, and was in English, so I was happy.<br />Movie itself is only good if you've seen the previous ones, otherwise you probably won't like it.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|When I first got this game i thought that it was going to be really cool, plus i had read the reviews and it said that the game was 'awesome and 'fun'. Please don't waste your time with this game. Its hard to control and plain old stupid. The graphics are horrible and the end product is a mess. If you want to comb the hair you have yo do it clump by clump and when you do comb it, it looks to stiff. I wouldn't reccomend this game for anyone. Don't waste space to download this game. DON'T READ JUST THE FIRST REVIEWS THEY ARE DECEIVING!!!!!
B00CHNKJFO|3.0|I don't like that you only get two balls per game. Then you have to wait through all the scoring before playing again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun I think it's the greatest game ever!!! :) also I love the movie too and it was funny!!!
B009K0P10K|5.0|Close enough to reality to be believable. The cliff-hangers never disappoint. Not a lot of boring conversation. The story moves at a pretty rapid pace.
B00BP0OHO4|4.0|i had to replace this book and the one sent to me was better than the one i ruined. it had one small tear on the cover that the verbiage touting its condition made me surprised to see, but otherwise it was as advertised, delivered promptly, and let me replace an excellent book i had ruined.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a really fun logic/puzzle game. It is challenging but not so difficult that it is<br />frustrating. I play this with my kids and we all love it!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|If you love the 'The Rings' books and movies you will love this one too.  We both read it and agree, it is great!  So is the movie!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Better than i thought since the update its been way better and plus there is NO LAG. I highly recommend buying this game.
B005ISQ7JM|1.0|Don't bother with this.  You'd be better off going to [...] and reading about HTML5.  If you'd like to get some of the larger books in the O'Reilly library, those are good.  This is just a little article.  You get what you pay for.
B005QBBC2S|5.0|This is a film any decent human being wants to hate. It is a thing no one wanted to watch, and some people had to because they are film critics, or market test groups, or Academy voters. It is one of those repugnant synopses that says, &#34;You have better ways to spend 2 precious hours of your life. This is madness.&#34; So, what got me to watch it on demand last night? I'll tell you what.<br /><br />I looked up from my laptop, from my shopping and banking and usual Saturday afternoon activities, whilst the tele was on in the living room. I looked up and saw Elizabeth Shue, a familiar face associated with good storytelling. The scene was unfamiliar--a movie I haven't seen?--I watched for a minute. Then the camera moved to Nicholas Cage and the look in his eyes chilled me to the bone. My soul searched for signs of a soul and found none. Nothing. Vacant. Utterly without life. Utterly believable. Gripping. A moment, a five-second shot maybe, a 10-second fixation (who's counting?), that is one of those moments in film history--that moment when you cannot take your eyes away, when you are mesmerized and horrified, filled with dread and pity.<br /><br />Wow. What is this? Hit guide--oh, it's that one--the one about the guy who wants to drink himself to death. Hm. But that moment, my god, wow-- Nicholas Cage, that was stunning.<br /><br />I went to a party that night and it was the first thing I had to talk about--have you seen this film--that moment? It made me want to watch the movie! How could I stomach two hours of watching a drunk? How could I even consider it? I hate drunkenness, it is not entertaining, it is not even a little bit interesting--drunks are boring, obnoxious, pathetic cowards who have checked out. They do the worst thing in the world: bore people. Wear people out. Shackle loved ones with pity and dread, day upon day upon day. How could I watch this?<br /><br />Last night, it was a must-search, and I found it, started it, almost turned away, but that moment compelled me. Here is what is astonishing about the art of filmmaking: every aspect must be in place for the magic to happen. It is more difficult than theater because you have an army to feed, the clock is ticking, the greedy Wall Street dragon is coming after you--all of you--if this is a bomb, your careers will all take a nose dive--it's all about the money at the top. Those greedy narcissists who run our world, who fire producers who greenlight projects like this with their precious investment--heaven forbid they have to give up a second boat! Here, in this movie, the magic happened because everything went clinkety-clink, and there is a reason why the Academy recognized Nicholas Cage for the success of this film as a work of art that moves people profoundly and most unexpectedly! It's this: it all was on his shoulders. If that character wasn't real to us, the whole thing fell apart. If he couldn't make us believe in that guy and fall in love with that drunk, and care what happens to him, it's a flop, someone gets fired, actors phones stop ringing, they don't get called back--they're poison--they did that flop, nobody will ever trust them again.<br /><br />On stage, the next night you can redeem yourself. Not on film, it's a one-time record and you had better get it at the right angle, in the right lighting, with the right music, framing the the whole thing, or it's a shrug. Nobody cares if this guy lives or dies. Nobody believes her reaction.<br /><br />Absolutely stunned. I watched the whole damn thing and was glad I did. More than that--this is a film that made me want to read the novel. That almost never happens to me.ment compelled me.

B008K6HN8I|4.0|I liked the ES File Explorer.  I downloaded it in order to help get Flash installed on my Kindle Fire, but like it for more than that.  It was a struggle previously to figure out if our files actually got transferred (via USB) to our Fire and where they went, since they weren't always showing up under the expected areas in our Kindle Fire.  This tool works great for seeing what files you have and where they are at.  I only gave it 4 stars, because it doesn't always work as you would expect intuitively.  But overall, it's great.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is amazing to live in a puzzle it seamless is like a great game for anyone that likes puzzles..
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The Room was very imaginative and the graphics were great. I look forward to future games they come up with.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved this FAOTD! I'd spend a lot of time trying to figure out some levels,and some were not quite as difficult.But all in all its a very nice app! I had to cheat a little by going to the helps tho...
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|The opening is the best on TV because it sets the mood, and you don't want to miss a moment. The cast is awesome.  Love the priest's dilemma!  Love the whole thing, everything about this series is mind and eye candy.  It's playful at times, in just the right ways.  Visually stunning.  We can't wait for Season 2!
B00122Z7NK|5.0|and this album still gets me going. It's great that these guys experimented with so many varied techniques and styles throughout this album.
B0055MI8K2|4.0|Owned this product for a year but I have notice that Amazon is trying something that should be made aware of, Posting the incorrect item discription to a product that isnt in the picture. I guess when companies get so large little things seem so small but its still called \\"**** FRAUD ***** \\". For the product Terra Fi 3 its very dorable and a lot of support. The heel support is alittle annoying in the first months wear but it eventually becomes a nice fitting sandle and great for daily use.
B005EVVESM|5.0|This is in my car, and I listen to it everytime I drive.  I just can't get enough.  Every song is great to listen to, even though there's a couple I don't get, I still love the tempo and enjoy this immensely.
B0097PW7H8|5.0|Works great keeps battery charged at optium level  the graphics are easy on the eyes  no problem with following along when its in charging mode everyone should have this on there battery draining device
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the minions! THEY'RE SO FLUFFY! This is a nice time-waster when you're standing in line, nothing on tv, etc.
B005XUC398|5.0|This is the defining statement on Wall Street and their huge mistakes in MBS sales. And how they treat their own and how they cover it up and who &#34;they never lose money' ... &#34;be careful&#34; ... amazing film on the subject we are still paying for ..
0753541637|5.0|Read this as part of a female academic book club.  Sandberg makes some good points in this very well researched book.  Would recommend for male readers as well.  Many of the issues are broadly applicable.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I love young adult lit and The Fault in Our Stars ranks right up there with The Book Thief on my all-time favorites list. It is not only beautifully written, but it makes you care about its young characters and their long-suffering families. Hazel, the narrator, lives on the edge of death and although she talks about giving in to her chronic disease, you know she'll keep fighting. This isn't &#34;Rocky&#34;. This is real life in the world of Cancer kids.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|It's a cute game FOR MY 5 YR OLD DAUGHTER!!  Ok, here's an epiphany....games that my child enjoys perhaps, maybe, I think possibly may NOT be a challenging app for me (an adult) as well.<br />And here's the crazy part...as I reviewed this app to decide to download this FAOTD I happened to read that some stuff COSTS ACTUAL MONEY. Now perhaps the description on my Kindle Fire may be different than others....but I doubt it.<br />GREAT GAME FOR MY LITTLE ONE!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the dynamics between the characters and how the creator doesn't fail to surprise the audience. Eagerly awaiting the next season.
B005544V6A|5.0|Didn't watch when it first aired, but can't get enough now! I already have my DVR set to record the new season.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|Takes a lot to really not keep me amused or interested. The writing was bland and predictable. It was just bad. I wish I could have my money back. Disappointing for such great actors.
B004J4WLB4|2.0|I may have been in the wrong mood when I read this, but the idea of an &#34;aging out&#34; foster with a history of violence and solitude finding happiness is totally preposterous. Good friends recommended this book but I won't be doing that to others.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|My husband and i found this tv series to be totally out of the norm. Off the wall things, but it makes you think sometimes. Love it!
B000JZ45LQ|5.0|THIS LADY IS A CLASSIC, I BELIEVE SHE IS LOSING HER TOUCH DOWN THROUGHOUT THE YEARS; I BELIEVE SHE DOES A  LOT FOR KIDS AND &#34;BIG KIDS<br />I LOVE CHER, SHE IS FUN
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game. when I start playing it is hard to put down.Keeps me busy for hours. Ifyou like finding hidden items this game is for you.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|Now I've completed watching all three..! Well made, well written, and well acted as always. Made me reflect on my own experience.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like that the game gives you legit challenges but never feels impossible. I agree with the other reviews. Not too easy or too hard. wish there were more levels. I finished the game in a day.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This novel is an excellent read. Any woman should read this, and I think men should love it too. Anyone who's ever been in life upheaval, anyone who's felt like running away from life...  it's just a great story of adventure, strength, and discovery. Loved it.
B005CRQ2DK|4.0|Best book ever so cool more cool in at winter camp!!!!!!<br />I read every book this was the best one  ever
B005LAIGPA|4.0|I know that this movie has gotten many poor reviews but I liked it. I think it would have better if they showed more time passing, to allow the characters to develop their relationships and powers more. I guess I like the question they movie presented. All of the boys received amazing abilities, but did the power corrupt or was it the problems each boy already had that impacted how they responded to life and the powers?
B001ANYDAO|4.0|I always enjoy Gladwell 's books.  Some of the examples sounded familiar. Basically, work hard and take advantage of opportunities that open before you.
0143038583|3.0|Becoming outdated and there are tons of similar books on the  market.  I bought it used which how it should be purchased.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|I loved reading the third book.Their story has carried on in such a way that I could not put the book down.  I loved the other two books.  If Sylvia says there is more I cannot wait.  I want to know the happy ending between Gideon and Eva.  I recommend a very good read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is pretty cool.......its not so hard you cant do it ...but easy enough you can!  cant wait to see the upgrade
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book is as captivating as the others. I can't wait to read the next book in the series. Waiting patiently!!!
B005H9B44A|4.0|Entertaining and fast paced. Could have built the relationship more during movie before the \\"i love you\\" moment toward the end (just slightly annoying). But otherwise a good choice. (Plus 2 hours of looking at mr helmsworth!)
B007Q0OUNA|5.0|This package has many Lego minifigurines which my 7 year old son liked a lot.  The weathertop model is not that big so it's great for kids that want to carry the Lego pieces around to different parts of the house.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved reading this book.  The characters were beautifully written.  I loved both Sky and Holder they found a connection between each other.  I could not put the book down I wanted to know the ending.  Very hopeful.  I recommend a very good read.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This series beats out 50 shades of grey hands down! This is well written and keeps you reading. Read the trilogy.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Better than other Sparks' novels.  Very touching story.  Characters are real and likeable.  Great beach read for those of us who love romance.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Believing that each one of our life has a meaning is the key faith for survival. Viktor Franklin's experience and teachings are precious gem for mankind to lead a meaningful life. A must read book for people from every walk of life!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My kids loved this movie and it was fun to watch it with them. Good story, entertaining and fun for the whole family.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|It's a very long exiting read. I think it could do with more people living and more people joining the elince.
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|Edge of your seat, fast paced thriller. Great action packed movie. A must watch for everyone. See it now if you haven't.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game. Can't wait for more rooms. I enjoy good games that make you think. Fun for the whole family.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|this app is very good it lets you see how long you have left on your battery.As well as when pouted up lets you see how long tell fully charged. in my opinion this app is wonderful to have of your kindle fire. I highly recommend this app to everyone.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|/we are super happy with this game..its pretty realistic and easy to use..my daughter and I both play and its easy to pick up and go...its a lot of fun..its a great little hobby<br />its a lot of fun..
B0083ZBW2Y|3.0|I suppose the ending was more or less inevitable, but it stirred up the fear of canines since I was a chld!  i admire dogs, but don't really like them truth to tell.
B005LHOKFS|1.0|I can't make it work at all. Spent at least 45 minutes trying to get help on the website and finally gave up.  Only viable option seems to be to snailmail request, which I have done.  What a dissapointment!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|THIS GAME IS JUST RELAXING  EVENING THO I CANT PASS THAT BIG HILL. I AM STILL TRYING AND HOPING TO PASS IT SOMEDAY
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|it has every thing you want in a game it has cute cuddley animals toplay with and it hasminy games
B00AR83PN4|2.0|I love match 3 games, and I love Tetris. This game is a good concept, but it needs a lot of improvements.<br />The controls are annoying, but useable. The music is nerve-grating. The biggest problem is that the game area is too zoomed-in. If you have 3+ levels built up, you have a fraction of a second to put the next piece in SOMEWHERE.<br />Good try, developer, but keep trying.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|I am reading the fourth book about Harry Bosch now and think he is a great one-of-kind.  Such personality. Michael Connelly's books have all been interesting and good mysteries.  His descriptions of the setting and surroundings are so real and educational.  I learned about the tunnels in Viet Nan in 'Black Ice' that I'd never heard of before.  Can't wait to read more about Harry!
148951418X|5.0|I got a Gopro and this book as a gift and wanted to film my kids at the beach, etc. I was kind of nervous to use it because the camera is confusing, but this book explained it and I started slow. Thanks for helping me learn the different ways of filming and how to edit. I've got some cool videos of my kids now. I keep thinking of more fun ways to film them the more I read the book. They are my stars and I'm enjoying my gopro a lot now that I've gotten used to it.<br /><br />Thanks for the clear instructions!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I recently watched all of the Downton Abbey seasons, thanks to Amazon Prime!  I loved them all, and enjoyed watching the characters grow and change over a short period of time.  There were many shocks and surprises in this season, mostly due to actors not wishing to return.  It's difficult to imagine their reasoning, considering the extreme popularity of the show, but the writing of the drama and humor was superb!
B006GWO5NE|2.0|I have like 4 of them but they don't really have a purpose but to plug in the charger that's all really
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Nothing like I expected, very funny and would recommend it to any zombie fan, the one liners were terrific h
B005544V6A|5.0|Loved it!! Great chemistry. Could not wait to watch the next episode. Could not wait until I could start season two.
B004UID2LC|5.0|The app di free youtube is awesome for music lovers on my kindle fire I have it so I will not any longer waste money buying from Amazon music store with this app you can download music,video, even whole movies vie mp 3 aac or video but I have 1 problem with it I will hit the search button and it will close and the notification that it has stopped shows up and after you press ok and reopen the app it will work DON'T WASTE MONEY ON  AMAZON MUSIC OR VIDEOS DOWNLOAD FREE APP TODAY
B00A81MV3U|1.0|Almost the entire movie was spent with a dialog of the main character making offensive statements to everyone,including those who really cared about him.It made me uncomfortable watching everyone's anguish.There was no special insight into mental illness.The only positive thing was the superb acting of the main characters.
B005V5WBFG|4.0|I have this product on my main computer.  It works great on it. My internet provider uses this security.  Have not had any problems so far. Knock on wood.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Very informative! This explains a whole lot. So many people's lives are changed from gluten intolerances and intestinal disorders in the past 10 years. My family members lives have been changed forever because of such disorders. irritable bowel syndrome, Ulcerative Colitis, Celiac disease, and the list goes on. Ulcerative colitis has lead to multiple hospitalizations for my children who have been the epitomy of health ( physically fit, health conscience eaters, yogis, and you name it). Now family events are governed by what and where each of my three adult children can and can't eat and how close the nearest bathrooms are. One unfortunately has had to resort to having their complete colon removed with the small intestine being butterflied and converted to a J-pouch. Life changing to the point where people just do not understand... I could go on and on, but I have always suspected the impact of those bagels.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Enjoyed each and every episode. Can hardly wait next season starts. Just wish I did not have to wait for it on tv. Love amazon prime!!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Whoever  wants to play...PLAY IT!  It is based on the movie and it is AWESOME! You must Play it. Although some things on the game cost real money it is AWESOME!
B004XZR63M|5.0|Found the book awesome to read. Made me want to learn and more about the different things that he talked about.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game I'm actually addicted to it...is that bad????<br /> We'll even thoe this gAme cost $6.99 it's 100% worth it!!!<br />For all those losers who have nothing to do in life this is your game lol
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I'm watching all episodes one after the other as I missed it first time around. It's highly entertaining and reminds me of LA  Law a bit. The acting is outstanding.
B000YJ85BI|5.0|There's something about Scalzi's prose and storytelling that makes his work easy and pleasing to read. I won't do any goofy plot summaries or unnecessary spoilers. The pacing of the book was ideal and the characters are believable and likeable. I would recommend this to anyone looking to try out Scalzi's work.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is very addictive. I can't seem to put it down. I like the fact that it makes you think.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was my favorite of all three books.  So glad it turned out the way it did.  I was rooting for Ana all the way!
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|This is such a Great show. Lots of action and surprises. Unbelievably great acting. I can't wait for the second season to begin.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|good game once I got it downloaded. sitting up most of night to play. give me more like this, please!!!!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Like this app. Like the other reviewers I too like that it is not too easy but not too hard.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This was a very interesting book.  It kept my attention from beginning to end and I couldn't wait to read book three.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fantastic! I love it, my 4 year old loves it as well! I think it is well made and the minions are great! Definitely recommend!
B000NGTJTY|5.0|Not a big fan of the rivers of blood type of flicks but everyone in this movie plays stunningly - Jack Nicholson above all.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|An excellent tale that includes great action, rich adjectives, and well-researched, historical & political reference. The narrative is rich in imagery and emotion throughout. Great read!
B0015AARJI|1.0|This remote control is weak beacuse of many things:<br />1- the buttons are so stiff<br />2- shut off by it self while playing<br />3- sometime it doesn't work at all<br />4- while playing it rolled to the left in the game
B000JMKQX0|3.0|This is a &#34;narrative&#34; history of the zombie wars -- its a great premise, but then it becomes repetitive and somewhat dull -- all of the characters, be they &#34;government officials&#34;, men, women, or petty criminals talk the same -- they all curse, swear, and use language that real people don't use. Still, its an entertaining read. Threads are started and never developed -- some cities and situations are described, but then never gone back to explain what happened. Seriously over-rated from a critical point of view (which is what got me to read this in the first place, since I am not a zombie fan or horror fan). Add one star if you are.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|The Crossfire Series had me hooked! In anticipation for Entwined with You, I re-read the first two, excited to finish up the Gideon/Eva saga. Unfortunately, the ending is downright horrible. So why two stars? I enjoyed the fact that something (finally!) came out after multiple delays. But Mrs. Day should have stopped here. Is it better than Fifty Shades go Grey, absolutely. Can Mrs. Day write, yes. However, the buck stops here. The audience you cater to determines success and I think this audience has had enough.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|i really liked these books. i didn't go any farther when the review for the next book for horrible. so i stopped here.
B008MM9630|3.0|Graphics are good but game needs constant energy and diamonds. Will probably work on other games that are less expensive.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Very lite, great fit for over the head ear phones. Sound is very good and comfortable to wear. Would recommend this to friends
B009KUWWW0|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read. I really became a part of it and when I finished it , I had a big problem trying to get over it. I couldn't start another book for several days. I just couldn't get it out of my mind.
B009HUB40Y|2.0|i have played it sever times, but just to pass the time before i have lives in candy crush LOL. my son likes to play it.
B002A5WQ8W|5.0|The first time I heard Brubeck I was ten years old it was 1962 I have never grown tired of this music.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Some parts of this were great, it's visually awesome, but it seemed lacking in something and I can't put my finger on it.  It's just not quite what I was expecting I guess and seemed a little lifeless.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Well written and kept me interested the whole way through. Also enjoyed the history insight of an area I did not know.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|the app never would downloand to my Kindle. kept saying app error. i've tried to delete the app from the kindle but it just never goes away... frustrating!
B000002L61|5.0|what can i said about Dio´s Album..... great voice, great music and also great headbanger too. unfortunately i never saw him live.<br />it's a masterpiece. you must have it
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|Ended up fast forwarding most of it, watched it in like 20 minutes, Save it for a rainy day when you've seen everything else.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|Good move good story and well put together a more mature twist.  I thought that it was maybe a little off of what I expected but overall was still good.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My Horse is great for all ages!!! The game is also VERY encouraging! Plus, My Horse is absoulutly PERFECT for horse lovers!!!!! So, is you absolutely LOVE horses, this is DEFINATLY the game for you!!!!!
B00CATSONE|5.0|I got this book because I had read some information about Tesla vs Edison on theoatmeal.com.  Well, I must say it is an eye-opening book about electricity and its history.  Even more wonderful is the way the book inspires the reader to be active with their imagination.  One of the most worthwhile books I have read. Loved the quotes and the history lesson.  Thank you for writing such a great piece .
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Loved this movie, didn't think I was going to but I really did.  It's like if Girl Interrupted and Benny & June had a baby
B000HL2J0G|5.0|Had to revisit and old favorite.  Just had a lot of fun watching it again.  They don't making like this anymore.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Interesting set of characters in this show. Good acting, but I won't tell you the plot of the show, that would ruin it for you! Enjoy with actors such as :  Julianna Margulies, Matt Czuchry, Josh Charles, Archie Panjabi, Christine Baranski, Chris Noth and several other fine actors.
B008OOYALE|5.0|My granddaughter love the adventure of this game. You all need more of theses type of games.<br /><br />Thank you<br /><br />Grand Ma Von
B004R2DS9C|4.0|Nothing good or bad to say, this product just is what it is, a handy carry box for mom and a play mat for kiddo, end of story
B005HED11Y|1.0|The sound was way too low.  It made it unwatchable.  I've noticed this with many prime rentals, esp Star Treks
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|This book was ok, it got a little boring and took me a long time to read. I couldn't really get into it. The first two were good and i couldn't stop reading, but this one i feel like i was reading the same thing every chapter. I wouldn't recommend this book.
B00CJ32S74|5.0|This sound track is nothing short of absolutely AMAZING. This is one of the few soundtracks that moves my heart and changes my emotion with each changing song. Everyone on this track has amazing talent. Just AMAZING.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|Was awesome, is it profound, life changing, moving? NO, but it's a lot of fun.  I'm guilty of fast forwarding through most shows because I get impatient and I can't stand when things are so drawn out and predictable... I watched this entire movie without touching our remote, lol... loved it
B005K17RU0|1.0|I wanted to like the new looks.  I tried hard to make it work for me as well as it did before but, no dice.  I used the old version every day, no kidding, every day and many times more than once a day.  The info was the most accurate I'd found and the display of info was beautiful, sleek even.  Now it looks like garbage and takes me forever to navigate/slide around the pages trying to decipher the teeny text.  I hate it and am off to find something better.  DO NOT &quot;FIX&quot; IF IT AIN'T BROKEN and the old version was in no way broken.
B008P9M614|1.0|I did not receive disc 4 for season 1. If you order this, be sure to check as soon as possible that all discs are present.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Read the first two, waited patiently for the third book and am pretty disappointed with the entire series. How long can you drag out the dysfunctional relationship between the two main characters before your readers lose interest. I'm thinking after 3 books there should be some movement forward and maybe even a culmination but no...you are just left hanging with the hint of maybe a 4th book. Nothing resolved. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.
B00992CF6W|5.0|loved it! but wastes alot of battery. still is awesome and no wifi is needed for this fun app! buy it!!!!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|A family member recommended this book. Once I started to read I didn't want to put it down. When your done reading this read Walking Disaster.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game. I just wish they had more rooms to navigate through. They said that more are coming. I know it takes time to create new rooms, but hopefully they will update soon with lots more to challenge us.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|So addictive I have to come home from work to dish up as no WiFi , I am gutted when my cooking is spoilt !
B009LMTDL0|3.0|I was really impressed with the level of research that went into several of the points and chapters in this book.  That said, even though it approached (self-identified) boldness by attempting to put vulnerable stories out there, by &#34;my way of leaning in,&#34; only a few of these stuck with me (most notably: when Sheryl described her initial negotiating approach with Mark and the reasons why).  This was a real, raw, intriguing high point of the book IMHO, and more of the same would have been far more impactful overall.<br /><br />I also completely missed the author's approach to distinctively specifying her points about &#34;women&#34; in the workplace vs. women that are &#34;moms&#34; in the workplace.  These ways of being in the world - while sometimes sequential - are not identical.  There was one (highly welcomed) specifically identified anecdote here, but I felt that often the narrative conflated the two.
B001JU4S44|3.0|I am not a Tome Cruise fan, but I do like the way these movies are made.  I like the stories, photography, sound, lighting, etc., just not a fan of TC.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This game is easy to understand. The graphics are extremely good. The battles that you fight are sometimes hard to win, but I suppose you have to build up your army so that you have enough men to fight with. I recommend this game for anyone from kids to adults.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|Difficult to get into at first, then I was absolutely rivetted and enjoyed the main body of the book. I had saved the last few pages and was looking forward to seeing who might get their 'just desserts'... or... would the truth come out publicly. I know we don't expect a predictable ending... but the finish of this book left me feeling flat... and a bit cheated. I would not recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game really gets you thinking in different ways. Very addictive. Can't wait for the next updates.<br />Even though the game is free, I would buy it.
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|well made, loads of action, explosions, stunts, one liners, and of course, heroics of the John Die Hard tales.  It's okay for a night in watching the tube, or should I say flat screen.
B00COHAUD4|1.0|Why must children be put through every possible type of loss, misery, and torture in a horror movie?  Without giving away the ending, I'll just say it's \\"piling on\\" pessimism, victimization of the innocent, and condemnation.  Too bad the man behind \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\" couldn't find a story more worthy of his talents.  The whole concept of \\"ghost from ancient insane asylum who lost her baby\\" is tired and worn out.
B00CFA222M|4.0|Loved this movie, cant see much wrong with it, even set up the digital copy on my Vudu.<br />Definitely worth seeing.
0307719774|5.0|love this product! great activity for the summer! been wanting this book for a long time! i finally have it
B00COGY2P2|5.0|So, if you have read any of my other reviews, I usually state up front that I am not a Cruise fan.  But I really liked him in this movie.  Having never read the Jack Reacher books, his physical size did not bother me.  But he played this part pretty well.  Still not a fan though!
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I liked this one, it held my attention quite well. Had to think about what I was doing. Kept busy
B009JZSFUY|4.0|Not much of a fan of TNG, but loved this story. excellent movie.<br />Much action in this one as well, definitely better than generations.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I love this game , and now I can build a deck my way and I get slivers oh hell yeah.<br /><br />  Slivers are back
B009K916ZK|4.0|me gusto
0345803485|3.0|I cannot believe this book is getting the attention it is other than perhaps for the subject matter. It's not well written - it's trite - and predictable.  I don't get it. E. L.  James has got to be a guy - the characterization of Ana is not at all believable - she's pretty \\"goofy\\" and Grey sounds like a total depiction of  E. L. James'  wet dream. I bought the trilogy but won't be reading the other two books. However, E.L. James must be doing something right for these books to have made such an impact.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|I really enjoy using flowpaper, especially when I need a break from the daily routine. I just wish there were more options for brush strokes and you could chose the colors, (maybe it DOES have this feature and I just haven't discovered it yet). Anyways, it's a great app. :)
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|I am picky about my rock and I rarely buy full albums and this one does not disappoint! Love it. The guitar riffs are as sophisticated as the vocals,
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Much better than 100 floors. The puzzles are more involved and a little easier to follow. Can't wait for the new levels.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I'm enjoying game so far. Love G5 games. Looking forward to getting through the next chapter and future G5 games.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|because this artist rocks and I love her music so much and she is such a good singer/ songwriter and her last cd unbroken was so cool I loved the whole thing.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|The excellent quality met my expectations as Blu-ray and the cost was equally as gratifying. I have waited quite some time for the perfect deal and have finally found it!
0465022227|5.0|Let's be very clear. The book contains nothing one couldn't come up with within 10 minutes of thinking (if you can't science might be not your future ;). But it does so in a way that is a joy to read. The case studies relate to so many people I know and it clearly shows that the author knows what he's talking about and he lays out the reasons and consequences in a very nice way.<br />Bottom line... top book. Just please adjust the price - 10 USD for a kindle book that thin is a bit hilarious!
B000001DVD|3.0|Has a few good songs on it. Easy listening for people who love timeless classic rock from the hair bands era.
B004EPZ070|5.0|Because this movie had such a great plot and also finding out that your best friend's fianc&eacute; is marring the wrong girl and also that you the friend loves him.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|No let down in season 3, it was just as great as seasons 1 and 2. Love the storyline developments with Anna and Mr. Bates.
B00AGDY4AI|5.0|A great movie with John Wayne.  Lots of laughs and has good quality.  One movie that I could watch over and over.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|I love this band. They are a Canadian band that has been successful for a few years and their music explains why.
B00821OX98|4.0|I like show even if it has \\"been done before\\". Pretty solid acting & good story. This has a \\"Jerico\\" feel. A group of normal people come together to survive.
B00BRYDKM8|5.0|The value of a book has less to do with the number of pages and more to do with the content. This book, though not long, is packed filled with HELPFUL formulas on conducting an outstanding presentation. I have read many books, some twice as long on the same topic, that offered as much or less help.
B00BEZTMQ8|2.0|Nothing like the LofTR's. The bunny driving 20 in a line with the 5th Wizard was over-the-top. Then it rolls his eyes. Not in the original with The Hobbit. And when the King of the goblin's was singing a song, which was stupid, and has about do die said &#34;that will do it&#34;. &#34;that will do it&#34; LOL but it was pretty sad. There was more violence then the original. I haven't even competed the movie.
0802798233|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone above the age of 14. It is absolutely wonderful. It contains adult matter though.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|Works great, keeps the kids entertained. Keeps me entertained. Doesn't get much better than Angry Birds. The ad free version is definitely worth the money, especially when children are playing it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was wonderful. I laugh , I cried . It was on of the most amazing books I have ever read
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|I'm a pediatric nurse, and one of my 7-year-old patients wanted me to start playing this so we could both play it at the same time. It is the first game of this type that I have played.  I've enjoyed it, but don't appreciate that you can't really advance very high without spending real cash for in-game aura. That will probably cause me to lose interest fairly soon.
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|I have had Siriius/XM for years and this is a batter music option IMO.  More choices and much better genres.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Found this game on Facebook, and as  pleasantly surprised to find it on Kindle, as most King games aren't available for Kindles. Still waiting for Candy Crush!
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|This book, while it may start out a bit darker than the other previous books, continues to amaze and astound.  It is a wonderful book
1476719071|4.0|College is a place where you can escape your past or find your past is closer than you thought. Abby has become the quintessential good girl during her freshmen year at Eastern University. No one would suspect her past has hidden secrets. However, all this changes when she attends a secret fight held in different locations at the University. The fight is very compelling for Abby. After the fight, she meets Travis Maddox who is considered the campus's sexiest bachelor. Travis is not known as a man who sticks to one woman. Even with his reputation he attracts plenty of female attention. However, when he first meets Abby she is not impressed by his rakish ways. However, he and Abby soon become friends. Travis and Abby make a bet which Abby loses. Now, she has to live with Travis for a month. During their time together they begin to develop a romantic relationship. However, Abby does not believe Travis is the type of man she should be seeing. So, she decides to date a respectable man who shows an interest in her. However, she is drawn to Travis and does not know how much she needs him. Abby and Travis will have to face countless obstacles (including themselves) to have their happy ending.<br />This is one of those books that you just have to know what happens. There are certain aspects in this book that somewhat irritated me. However, every relationship is different. I can envision these characters in real life and feel like I became the invisible spectator to their relationship while reading Beautiful Disaster by Jamie McGuire. This is not the type of relationship I would encourage anyone to have. But do I think these characters will be happy? Yes, I do. America is the type of best friend we should all have. She is supportive and always there for Abby. She also tells Abby she is crazy when Abby is ignoring what she wants.  America's relationship with Shepley is also interesting. There is constant drama in this book. However, relationships and friendships have drama (just hopefully not this much.) I will be reading Walking Disaster so I can get a better insight into Travis's mind. I would advise that readers approach this book with an open mind. However, I would recommend Beautiful Disaster to readers who enjoy romance heavy on the drama.st hopefully not this much.) I will be reading Walking Disaster so I can get a better insight into Travis's mind. I would advise that readers approach this book with an open mind. However, I would recommend Beautiful Disaster to readers who enjoy romance heavy on the drama.
1401923119|5.0|lets take cancer genes. He makes a strong case for the environment AKA you internal body's PH, stress hormone levels, blood toxicity, and a host of other risk factors for cancer are more influential than the dreaded cancer gene. Its just one factor that the news takes advantage of to keep people living in fear and victims of their parents genes and belts, only kidding. But really he makes the case, as a cell biologist and teacher of cellular biology, that genes expression is more dependent on internal environmental factors. At least that what i took away from it. It scientifically strengthened my belief that the cancer gene curse is just one relatively small risk factor of cancer susceptibility. Now, I believe positive beliefs are the best way to balance the internal system and one of if not the best defense against cancer. Along with a healthy diet and good exercise habits offset the cancer predisposition. I must add that most people don't get genetic testing they just go off of one family member having cancer. If you parents smoked and got lung cancer, throat cancer maybe it was the hundreds of chemicals in the cigarette that gave them cancer and not some genetic predisposition. Don't tell them that, just don't smoke cigarettes and the chances of you getting lung cancer are slim to none. This is just what crystallized for me after reading The Biology of Belief by Bruce Lipton.
B00CL68BK2|3.0|All the best parts of this movie are in the trailer. The movie was a huge disappointment. But the download was fast, and playback was amazing. Great picture quality as well.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|this was a very funny move, but it does have a number of sophomoric humor and jokes in it (so this is not my wife's style of movie) -
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because of all the great things you can collect on the track.  It is a fun and entertaining game, and so far it is my absolute favorite.<br /><br />Bridgette
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a fun game to help give you a little mental escape for a while.  It is rather addicting too.
B00821OX98|2.0|To chaotic and dark of an opening, didn't find engaging at all. If the first half hour of a pilot doesn't catch me and make me watch then its not worth my time.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show! Excellent casting! So glad to see it on amazon! I look forward to watching the whole series!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I only gave this four stars because I thought that starting at the beginning every time you make a mistake was unfair.  Other then that, it is a pretty decent game.<br /><br />Bridgette
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I am working my way through the series, having never watched it before - enjoying every episode. Good characters, good story telling.
B00B29J0I6|5.0|So fun.  Really makes you think through the process of how to pass each level.  This is one of the games I use that supposedly keep your brain active to prevent Alzheimer's
B00CW665VI|5.0|Loved this book!  It had so much humor that I had a really hard time putting it down.  Can't wait for more books by this author!
B00AQ71FLK|3.0|The game is addicting but the server disconnects so much. Another reason why it's OK is because this game decides the winner by who's levels higher
1439133948|5.0|Thanks you Lois Bujold for another fine gem in the ongoing life of Miles Vorkosigan. Each book seems to have at least one heart-wrenching insight into the 'inner'Miles' who grows deeper and more interesting in each book. Those who know, will buy this upon sight of the author's name. Those new to Ms. Bujold might be better to get some of her earlier works to gain some insight into the universe she has placed Miles in. That said, even a newby would like this as a stand alone.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|I loved this movie as a child, and just watched it again with my kids.  They enjoyed the movie. It stood the test of time well.  I've been disappointed when re-watching many other movies from my childhood, but not this one.
B0026KX5PO|4.0|Research on the author of the book led me to discover that this movie is based on the first of FIVE novels about Mr. Ripley! This is an excellent plus for me.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game. If you enjoy games where you have to build up and try to out run people,you will love it as well.  There were only two down sides that I have discovered so far; one being that if like me you own the kindle fire 7, once your kindle reads low storage I had to delete a couple of other apps for subway surfers to stay queued to the device and the other being that once I did that I finally got the update for Paris. I should not have to delete apps for my other apps to update.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|This is an excellent series.  The legal cases are always interesting.  The drama of Alicia life is realistic and well done.
B002W1UEW4|5.0|It was very well put together. The only thing I didn't like was cobra's costume at the end of the movie.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I enjoyed this story so much.  What a fun and creative writer. I laughed at her main character Drew 's view and will read more of her artful stories!!!
B007FH9GA6|5.0|This film has it all - angst, dilemma, mystery, suspense mixed together on the backdrop of a bizarre group of interlocking personal stories that ultimately lead to solving an, as yet, unsolved murder (?) After watching film again (and again, it's addictive) I realized that the screaming &#34;wind&#34; at Martin's dinner party with Liv and Mikail, was actually the screams of a girl he had caged up in his torture chamber basement. Evil plays Good, but Good is born of Evil in this mind-bending plot.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|The game plays well and fast.  Good stuff and food graphics.  I like various difficulty settings as well.  Overall,a good game especially when one considers the price.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The show had decent ratings so I watched the pilot.  I liked the witty banter of the two main characters.  After a few episodes I was hooked.  Great show.  I am excited to watch season three.
B0062QRTKA|3.0|Your little ones will like this but for bigger folks its a bit slow.  You will still have some fun but what happens you get lost in distractions before things happen.  Give it a try but don't expect alot
B000W93CHC|4.0|This is a unique look at near death experiences from someone skilled in the sciences. If you don't believe after this book, well then.....
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Great program.  Has enough drama to stay one step ahead of a soap opera and allow me to be simply entertained.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Johnny Depp could have done much better.  Witches torture scened became redundant, however, it held the interest of young children.  Why does the music have to be so excessively loud? It overwhelms the dialogue and drive you nuts changing the volume.  Perhaps another indication that the movie need some help? I did hold the attention of children.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|I at first was not sure how I would like this having a wife from WV but even she liked this.  Controlls take a bit of practice but I will say this gets better the farther I get.  I will tell everyone give it a try you will get hooked
B0056TYT66|2.0|Below is my experience.  I spent many hours troubleshooting; in my computer this Transcend PCI card does not provide SATA III speed.<br /><br />I installed this in an HP Pavilion p6150t Desktop (purchased Feb 2010). The computer has SATA II on the motherboard, which provides 3 Gbps performance.<br />I purchased the Samsung 840 Pro SSD, which is SATA III (6 Gbps).<br />I purchased the Transcend PCI card because I wanted the faster SATA III speed.<br /><br />I installed Windows 7 on the SSD and installed the Transcend drivers from the Transcend website (http://www.transcend-info.com/).  Then I installed the Samsung Magician software from the Samsung website (latest version 4.1), and updated the firmware on the SSD.<br /><br />The Samsung Magician software detected that the SSD was connected to an SATA III controller.<br />The computer booted from the SSD connected to the Transcend PCI card.<br /><br />So, everything installed smoothly.  Everything worked fine.<br />However, when I did a performance test using the Samsung Magician software, I got performance similar to SATA II.<br />Even with SATA II performance, the computer was much, much faster than before, but I wanted to get SATA III performance.<br /><br />I wiped-out the SSD and installed Windows 8 because I thought Windows 8 might have better driver support (the Transcend website says that you don't need to manually download the drivers because they are included with Windows 8).  Everything went smoothly, but the performance was the same.<br /><br />I tried connecting the SSD to the on-board SATA II controller.  At first the performance was worse, but then I installed the Intel chipset drivers from the Intel website and then the performance was actually better than with the Transcend PCI controller.<br /><br />The last thing I tried was to remove my video card from my computer which is using the PCI x16 slot (the computer has four PCI x1 slots and one PCI x16 slot).  I put the Transcend PCI card in the x16 slot, and that did improve the performance of the Transcend SATA controller, but only slightly better than the onboard SATA II controller.<br /><br />My final conclusion:  This Transcend PCI card does not provide SATA III speed.  At best it's slightly better than SATA II speed.<br /><br />I put my video card back in the computer, connected the SSD to the onboard SATA II controller, and returned the Transcend PCI card.<br />Even with SATA II performance, the computer is much, much faster than before.<br /><br />At this point my Windows Experience Index scores are (without the Transcend card):<br />Processor:  6.4<br />Memory: 6.4<br />Graphics: 7.4<br />Hard Disk: 7.4<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Update:<br /><br />My motherboard is the Pegatron IPIEL-LA3 Eureka3-GL8, which uses the Intel G43 Express Chipset.<br /><br />I did some more searching and reading about the Intel G43 Express Chipset.  Apparently, the x16 slot is PCI Express version 2.0, but the x1 slots are PCI Express version 1.1.<br /><br />So that must be why the PCI card performed better in the x16 slot.

B0053O89XI|5.0|First off, The Big Bang Theory is just an awesome show. It had a tiny bit of a letdown in season 4, but season 5 definitely makes up for it. Everything from a Halloween-like episode to \\"Shamy\\" relationship to Howard and Bernadette's upcoming marriage to Leonard's love dilemma, we get it all. I found myself laughing more this season than the last one and the show gets better and better with every episode. The show is coming back for a 7th season and an 8th season as well. Now on to the blu ray.<br /><br />  I purchased this at the price it's at now, (22.49)and I got to say, that's a damn good deal for this show as I saw it at Best Buy for 39.99, but Best Buy does price-match as long as it's shipped & sold from Amazon. For 22.49, you get the whole 5th season of The Big Bang Theory on 2 blu ray discs, 3 dvd discs and on Ultraviolet digital copy all in one. That's basically a $60 deal. Highly recommend and I'll be looking forward to the 6th season blu ray this September. Anyways, great show and a great blu ray set.<br /><br />As Sheldon would say, \\"That's the beauty of it.\\"
B006P0FICE|5.0|Action! Action! Action!!  It is a freakin awesome movie! Great action! Sorry already mentioned that.  Great one liners that leave you laughing. All the actors show really awesome chemistry on the screen!  I thought it was a kick butt movie.

B002ZG97EC|5.0|This is my favorite movie!!  Glad I got it on blu ray because I would have worn out the tape if it was VHS!  If you do not like this movie there is just something wrong with you.  LOL
B003V9OCS8|4.0|German film with English sub titles. Solid acting and good story telling that sucks you into a politically and personally motivated climb up the north face during Nazi dominated pre 1936  Olympic era.
B001AZFO14|4.0|In terms of old-school 80's / 90's style Sci-Fi, this is that rare kind of movie that can be watched again and again with the passage of time, and this is due to a great job by the Director as well as by Kurt Russell.  In comparison to the bulk of box office money makers today which so weakly portray ANY degree of meaning or character depth, this movie by way of Kurt Russel really succeeds.  I wish more action movies would strive to capture what 'Soldier' has managed to do.  Somehow this movie sneaks into you and before you know it, you find yourself actually 'feeling' the struggle of the 'Soldier'.  I rarely experience this in any movies regardless of how recent or old they may be.  I actually appreciated this movie far more now than I was able when it first came out.  I was too young to appreciate it on it's initial release date.<br /><br />'Soldier' really is a well made movie with a great performance by Kurt Russel who managed to capture a very subtle, and therefore realistic portrayal of a human being in deep struggle with his programming.  In my view, the strength of Kurt's performance was so strong that he actually made it possible not to focus to much on any of the movies shortcomings.  In most action movies, there always seems to be a glaring, foolish, unbelievable scenario going on with the plot, presentation, and bad guys.  With this movie,you don't rally focus on anything but the inner truth of the 'Soldier' attempting to process his new position in reality, a position which his programming [brainwashing] seems to have entirely excluded.<br /><br />I give it 5 stars and this is how and why I arrive at 5 : In comparison to the last 50 or so movies I have seen, it IS, by far, an easy 5 star experience.

B008K8U13K|3.0|This is worth a play but the controls are clunky and sometimes it is hard to keep up with when the screen twists and turns with Sonic.
B009ZFPQOQ|5.0|I am very pleased with this app. Its a network of people all using the same navigation app. Alerts you to traffic, cops, red light cams and more.

B0096DZKZC|5.0|Game is really fun to play, it was like playing it on the Genesis for the first time, graphics are great controls arent bad either.

B0090KZDSK|3.0|I'm getting over this billionaire genre where the circumstance behind the young guys wealth is so far fetched it's unbelievable.  Why can't the guy be a millionaire? That would give some realism to the story. And why does the chick always have some (seemingly) shameful past? It's all a bit samey.  Good sex scences though.
B00005JM02|5.0|A nice family film. A story about a father's quest to find his son. Very adventurous and thrilling a must see.
086571701X|5.0|This is a project I have been wanting to start for a while. Thanks to this book I will start soon. Easy to understand. Glad I bought it!
B001NHNG64|5.0|This is the 2nd book in the series and I love it. I hope Child can keep his creativity up and continue to write books on this level. In this book Reacher is kidnapped along with a pretty FBI agent when he attempts to help her with her dry cleaning. It's unfortunate that Reacher is in the wrong place at the wrong time, but its very fortunate for Holly Johnson because Reacher is the sort of man who thrives on confrontation. Childs second book is better than his first and that's saying a lot.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0098L3LQW The Starlight Club (Starlight Club, The)]] by Joe Corso.
B008B68IUY|5.0|The hardest thing about being a Monster High collector is just how much Mattel of it puts out. If you're trying to be budget conscious about it like I am, some of the bigger items like this awesome car get pushed toward the back of the list. But if you can squeeze it in this is definitely one of the most fun pieces I've seen yet.<br /><br />Featured in the cartoon that aired on Nick in which the ghouls travel to Scaris for a fashion contest this jaunty little car saves the day. I wish I could jump in a time machine and take this back to my 7-year-old self because this is far cooler than any pink Barbie car I coveted back then. The open scroll work and colors make it distinctly Monster High and I like it for it's compact size much better than the clunky [[ASIN:B005IGU9IE Monster High Sweet 1600 Draculaura's Roadster]], though admittedly I have both. A great choice for a collector and in my humble opinion, an even better choice for a girl who's going to play with her MH collection. :)
B00BX50UEC|5.0|The contest has been growing a lot during the last decade. More mainstream songs, more known acts taking part, less trash. It's an amazing, exciting music contest, love it or hate it everyone is watching Eurovision Song Contest.<br /><br />This year's contest was surprisingly good and the level of the entries was high. Some of them disappointed me in their live performances, some others impressed me. Unfortunately, none of the entries managed to reach the success of last year's winning song \\"Euphoria\\" by Loreen which peaked at #3 in UK and enjoyed longevity while it received decent airplay during summer, just like everywhere else in Europe.<br /><br />I absolutely loved Cascada's Glorious, Anouk's Birds and Margaret Berger's I Feed You My Love.<br /><br />I recommend this compilation to everyone interested in Eurovision and whoever enjoyed this year's event or wants to catch up with this year's entries. I would also suggest to buy the official DVD including the three live shows, plus bonus material.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|It is a great game but they only give you like 15 min.And I don't want to spend like 4 bucks on the full one. The thing I didn't really like was when those evil bulls came after me and killed me. then another time I some how got into the tree. and I looked down and there was wolves. I didn't know what was happening to me that day because the animals all hated me.  at the end I was starting to get better in the game and I also had a tree house it was awesome and then the 15 min were up and I lost all those things. now when I play I try not to press that cruel butten and try to press that butten that says creative
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I was on a cruise and I was looking for a book to read. The store on the ship had an almost empty rack with very few books on it. One of the few books available was Killing Floor. Never having heard of Lee Child I bought the book out of necessity convinced that I would be disappointed in the story. Not only was I not disappointed, I couldn't wait for Childs next Reacher book to hit the book stores. If you're new to the Jack Reacher books I suggest that you read one because like me you'll be hooked.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0098L3LQW The Starlight Club (Starlight Club, The)]] by Joe Corso.
B009HXG9UQ|5.0|My girlfriend and I love this film.  The 1st time we rented it, the second time we bought it because we knew we'd want to watch it again and again. If you've seen a film directed by Wes Anderson (The Royal Tenenbaums, The Darjeeling Limited, etc.) you will already be familiar with his directorial style. He has a way of portraying the quirky side of human nature that I have loved in all his films, and this film is his best yet. Mr. Anderson portrays various aspects of each character's internal dialogue without putting the dialogue into words. Each character filters events from within his or her own reality construct coming to completely different and sometimes contradictory or mutually exclusive conclusions about it. It's as if they are in different movies. Often two characters with contradictory interpretations of their lives will be intimately related, or romantically involved.  Mr. Anderson doesn't spell it out literally for the viewer.  Rather, what you're supposed to be getting from a particular scene is implied.  Anderson assumes that the audience will have sufficient intelligence to follow the story.  I like being given the benefit of the doubt. I imagine that while the cast and crew are making the film there is debate about whether the point they are trying to make in a particular scene has been illustrated clearly enough. In this case I think the film wonderfully conveys the unspoken thoughts and feelings of the characters.<br /><br />To conclude, this film is a keeper.  It's a joy to watch and every time I watch it I notice things that I hadn't seen before.  I know what's going to happen, but I'm still entertained every time I watch it. I cry every time too, but that's one of the reasons I like this film so much.  :-)
B00DHHWYAW|5.0|You are going to LOVE this new Great Gatsby. Leonardo DiCaprio gives the performance of his life. The visuals are intense, especially in 3D. It's also quite faithful to the book in most ways. It's the best movie of 2013 so far.
B003QTSMXE|4.0|Has very positive messages and it is engaging and touching. Keeps the interest of the adults who understand the futuristic context, but enough fun action for the kids.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I got this app when google discontinued their rss reader. I have used it and like it, so far. It is pretty intuitive and well designed. Too bad the iOS version is broken.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I like this app a lot it's straightforward and easy to use but yet it has many features. Finding what product you're looking for is easy and the one click buy and ship features is nice!
B002QVZ71I|5.0|Forrest Gump is far more than entertaining. It is a good model for a life lived with gusto, truth, hope, and above all, love.
B002M87W1I|5.0|It is amazing to see this again and see how relevant it is today as it was 40 years ago. Truly a movie worthy of a remake, but has been overlooked in that respect. Great to see all of the now famous names with small roles and no credits. Powerful and engaging.
072325804X|5.0|Lovely book with wonderful colorful illustration.  The book is heavy and a 3 year old will not be able to hold it on their own.  Very beautiful collection all in one volume.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I don't like it because it erased a<br />World with me doing it<br />Other than that it's ok<br />So that's my report
B00CLIJ9A6|5.0|Quartet is one i'll be watching again through the years. WArm, witty, showing a depth of friendship, love and forgiveness that we all need more of.
B000GT6JS2|4.0|I missed this in the theaters and just came across it on cable and had to see the rest. The story line is rather simplistic, but the creativity, visuals, and art direction make it fascinating, engaging, hypnotic, and almost disturbing.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I use this at home too, but it is especially helpful for traveling. I don't usually lug my laptop around and this is so much easier!
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|This movie wasn't for me but some others may enjoy it.  Wasn't what I expected but I'm sure others will enjoy it, just not for me.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Omg magic how I missed you. What a great blast from the past! The app runs smoothly and the decks are really balanced.
B001O6W9QC|3.0|Some great comic actors thrown into an absurd story line. Robert Downey Jr. had the most solid performance and Ben Stiller and Jack Black show their expected farcical absurdity. Surprise performance by Tom Cruise who has an amazing character.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game is fantastic! My friends and I play this quite a bit and it never seems to get old. Great product from Mayfair games. Now all I need is the expansion.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Can't wait to watch the other season's, this is one great show. I recommend it to everyone. So watch it !!!!
B0022W6L6G|5.0|It is timeless Fleetwood Mac at their rise to fame! The music and lyrics are rich with meaning and bring me always back to a fabulous time in my youth. Loved them then, love them now. The music never changes-only we do. One of the best albums of all time...
B0046B8GEQ|3.0|A fun movie especially for younger kids. Of course, the minions have become ubiquitous in pop culture and carry the franchise.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am pleasantly amused by the 2nd Volume of the Hunger Games Trilogy. I can't wait to read the next volume to see how the rebellion works out. There is no 12th District left!
B000000I0K|3.0|Being a Mike Oldfield fan I was hopping it would be like Songs of a distant earth or Tumbler bells III, I was disappointed.
0553801473|5.0|I've never much of a fantasy fan beyond Tolkein and the The Once and Future King. But one episode of the series had me hooked and I couldn't wait to immerse myself in the books. I raced through the first four, then had to wait a good while for this one. But oh, my, it was certainly worth it.I've never seen an author who could juggle such a mega-cast of characters and narrative threads and keep the whole thing comprehensible in drop dead exciting. Not only are the existing characters sent off in some very different directions;  there a host of new characters and places -- including one young man (who shall remain nameless in this review) who has attracted the loyalty of some surprising people and whose plans could be devastating to this entire world from Westeros to the Slave cities to the Wall -- that is if he can just stay alive that long.<br /><br />I hope I won't be a spoiler by saying that this book, according to the author, is not the last to come in this magnificent series. Part of me was looking forward to closure (and the chance to get some long-delayed work done), but I must confess to being glad that there will be at least one more chance to immerse myself in this wonderful, horribly bloody and richly realized world.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I have nto read the popular books and somehow did not get to seeing this for some time. It was entertaining and interesting but lacked substance. I wanted to see less about the competition and more about the social impact the characters created.
B008JF8O9M|1.0|Does nothing it claims to when you get the free version it tells you on there web page you need to buy the pro version to print from web pages or mail and when you do that it tells you that it is not supported
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|I have been a fan of the movie since it come out . I have also wished  the videos' and the DVD that followed could replicate the colours of the original film stock. This restored version come so very close. cant wait for the 4K or 5K versions that will follow in the very long term, but in the mean time ,while unless you have the film stock you cant do better.
B003WUYOQ6|2.0|This author could have made his point in the first chapter. It went on and on and on making the same point with multiple studies. I found it painfully boring. Maybe if you were an analyst you would appreciate the multiple studies.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|When I first saw it in the theaters I was unimpressed. But on second viewing once you get used to the new cast, it was much more enjoyable and made it a great entree before seeing the latest installment in the franchise.
B002NT3B52|1.0|I was rally excited about this book.  I found it confusing and off topic a lot.  I was expecting a book about dogs and behavior not comparisons to monkey, apes and children.  I stop reading the boom half way thorough and don't think I learned anything about me two year old labradoodle I didn't already know
B003ZHR6RK|5.0|This is one of King's best tales. Shawshank Redemption in its book incarnation is very hard to put down. The movie is true to the book and has the assembly of some very fine actors, including Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. It is a charming tale, with great photography and excellent performances by every member of the cast. Character develpment is a hallmark of King's writing. It would be difficult to develop the characters in the movie the way King does in the book, but there is no doubt these people are as real as they are in print. The result is a screenplay that gives a depressing image of prison life and the struggles endured in this stark environment. This reviewer has seen this movie many times and it is just as engaging now as it was upon the first viewing.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|my son downloaded this on our kindle and he loves it. he plays it all the time with no complaints.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|It took two watchings to truly appreciate, but this complex intertwined story covering several centuries is worth the effort. Great cast, performances, makeup, effects and sentimental story lines are uplifting and unpredictable.
B0088W7VNG|4.0|After watching Stargate SG-1, I had to follow up with the adventures of those who went to Atlantis. The series had some great stories and interactions amongst the crew and some of the aliens they meet. The big prize was seeing Jewell Stait as Dr Keller. I remember her from the Firefly series.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I liked it all !! My interest in this period of history and the fine acting kept me up all night...
B009WO7NQO|5.0|my son is a angry birds fan and he loves to play this game! it does not freeze or slow down the kindle
B0047WJ11G|4.0|Excellent Philip K. Dick influenced mind mending story along the lines of The Matrix and Total Recall. Amazing effects and lots of twists and levels. Stay on your toes to not miss anything and you'll find it very satisfying.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Interesting read.  It is short but informative. Not an in-depth biography on Tesla, more a look at the type of personality that drove him.
B009R659L8|5.0|I recommend it to those who love reading mysteries.  Keeps you guessing almost to the end even though there are clues throughout.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|The game screen is too small on my kindle fire 8.9&#34;.  otherwise the game is fin, plays like on facebook
B0081336FO|5.0|This is easily the best remaking and rethinking of the classic Sherlock Holmes I have ever seen.  The stories are well thought out and using modern technology really adds to the character.  A Sherlock Holmes blog hosted by Watson, indeed.  Just brilliant.  As a long time fan of the classic Arthur Conan Doyle character, this modern interpretation is a stand out especially compared to the silly stuff being made with Robert Downey, Jr, et al.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|For the most part this game is pretty good. The graphics are fantastic and are the best feature of the game. The storyline isn't bad but isn't one that goes into great depth (now I’m not that far into the game). The playability if very good overall. The one thing that's disappointing is the fact that it's very repetitive, and you have to repeat the same areas to level or you die. Now, if you purchase the upgrades that are available to you they're very well worth it and will help you immensely. The biggest gripe I have is the fact that there’s not a way to know what areas are for what level or skill (at least not that I’ve found). Naturally it stinks that you have to constantly pay money in order to advance or repeat the same areas indefinitely. Personally I rather pay once to be able to play a game and be able to advance with the option to buy upgrades to just be invincible over having to constantly pay money just to be able to do the basics within the game but that’s how they make their money.<br /><br />Overall a great game but, as with anything, it has its downfalls.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved the characters and how the story was developed.  I also loved the movie and I thought the casting was very good.
B00B29J0I6|5.0|This game is great fun.  Physics based - it m akes you think and it very cute!  Would highly recommend it to strenghthen problem solving skills
B00BZW5W3W|5.0|Blue Velvet Soul is the truth! Maysa's voice is spectacular - this album sounds contemporarily fresh. She's not only a powerhouse vocalist, but a top notch lyricist too. I love the colorful lyrics, the musicians backing her up and yes, the house beats on several songs. She's one of my favorite female vocalists, been following her since her start with INCOGNITO back in the 90s and this album is her strongest yet. I love the fusion of  JAZZ, R&B, HOUSE BEATS and if that's your thing, you will love this album too.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I've played this game for a while. The graphics are good, it's easy to play, they did a great job on making the Vehicles, Aircraft and Military personal realistic. They even made people walk around and animated the buildings of the bases. the storyline is kind of weak and a bit lame but it's not bad. It takes a while to get going and is slow at first but they also did a great job and teaching you all of the different aspects of the game, what does what and how to do pretty much everything within the game.<br />There's plenty of ways to make money, power up your army and expand your base. You can play player versus player or story mode. One thing that you will find out is that just because you attack a low level player does NOT mean you will be able to win. If somebody has either enough friends and/or money they can be as powerful and unstoppable as you can imagine.<br /><br />A few things I dislike is the fact that if you're not careful or too quick while tapping your screen you can spend a lot of money very quickly. They have made it better in some aspects to ask if you're sure so it has improved. Also, it has it's glitches with connectivity and many bases will not load. Again, it has improved (and greatly for that matter) under their last patch but still has problems loading them.<br /><br />As for their latest update, they made several things better such as being able to load both enemy and ally bases, improved combination of Army Vehicles, Aircraft and Personal and expanded on buildings to improve your military. Now the downsides of the update, made some of the vehicle combinations sooooo expensive its unreal, the prices of improving the game play haven't improved and although they did allow for a secondary warning to ask &#34;are you sure&#34; on some aspects of the game they left others the same.<br /><br />As with all games, I rather pay a fee upfront and have the option to turn off &#34;In Game Purchases&#34; rather than have to worry about constantly spending money accidently that I didn't want and can't afford to spend. If there's a way to turn off &#34;In Game Purchases&#34; please let me know for I haven't found it.
B00AR83PN4|1.0|Dude I want my money back this games sucks and isn't even in the slightest bit fun<br />Think of something better next time
B002JXK5VU|5.0|My 12 year old came across this series and now we are all watching it as a family.  Very cool premise of a small close knit town where the nation's greatest minds live and experiement in secret creating extremenly cool inventions.  Story lines are interesting and  fun and offer good family entertainment.  I hate that we missed this series while it ran on TV, but there are 5 seasons here to ensure many long hours of viewing.
0345803485|5.0|I agree with most of the reviews<br />Relevent about City Life after 2010 People with little money meeting Multi-Millioners like mister Grey,<br />Realistic and exciting!!
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|I could have done without the funny accent which sounded Jamaicn to me.  I enjoy the actors so I was escorted to see what looked to be an interesting movie but I was disappointed and stayed awake just to see the ending.
B009MYARIK|5.0|I loved Wedding Night!! Such a funny story line. Typical Sophie Kinsella.<br />Lottie, and Fliss have a relatable relationship for sisters. Always wanting what's best, and not stopping at anything.<br />I recommend for a great summer read!
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I like I like you have to really be quick to fond all combitations. I am glad I downloaded this app. Thanks
B004T2QZL8|4.0|Super hard to beat one of my favorite games its so fun. Before you get it i would get the free version.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|This movie was absolutely incredible.  I've seen it over ten times and I still get goosebumps every time.  What makes the movie even more stunning is the outstanding quality a bluray disk provides. Watching this on a 1080p hdtv is insane. Even if you don't have a bluray player it comes with a dvd and a digital copy for long car rides. You will enjoy this movie if you've seen all of the Harry Potter movies.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever. Really addictive. You have to try it. Its worth the 7 bucks. My kids really love this game of survival
B001DMJ9R4|4.0|I've seen a lot of mediocre Avenged concerts but this one really caputures them at their height. If you're one of those that hates the band and their style then this isn't going to change your mind but if you kinda like them and are looking for their best live work, I would say this is the best you will see from them.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I bought this mic to attach to my GOPRO 2, and to capture better audio of my car while on the race track.  It does the job very well and it even came with a battery already- true plug and play!  The mic seems to be built well enough and the length of the cable was more than enough to situate the mic wherever I needed it.  All in all, great value here.  I mean it's just 20 bones people!
0385732554|5.0|I am not someone who loves reading, and I do not read often, but I really enjoyed this novel. Lois Lowry, the author, demonstrated how making a perfect world might not end up so perfect. You will not be disappointed if you are into science fiction novels. It's not expensive and the shipping is fast.  Check it out.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I really love this game and all the features it has with it. I just love games like these where you can create your own city. And there is so much to do. It's so exciting. I love the endless possibilities there are that you can do. I just love love love love love this game. It's definitely taking some greeting used to but overall it's the best city building city game I have played yet. I can't say it enough :). This app has some really good features to it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great when you're waiting on a plane. Airport layovers are not boring anymore! Though it does make me home sick faster.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|Could not play the game because I do not care to use it with facebook.  I choose not to have a facebook account ,and I don't think it is fair that everyone is trying to force people into having one,by only offering deals through facebook.  The practice game was really good. I would play it if I could.
B00C7TAF3Y|2.0|Tried to play this on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9, but most of the time it wouldn't load and I had just a black screen with some weird symbol. Tired of that so I deleted it. Too bad because the 1 or 2 times it did load it looked interesting .
B0079J28NW|5.0|I recently bought a Blu-ray player and was shopping for some movies that I hadn't seen in many years and which I suspected might benefit greatly from the Blu-ray treatment because of their visuals. That lead me of course to \\"Yellow Submarine\\".<br /><br />\\"Yellow Submarine\\" (originally released in 1968; 89 min.) brings the delightful story of how Pepperland is invaded by the Blue Meanies, and how the Fab Four is recruited to restore order in Pepperland. Several comments: first, I hadn't seen this movie in probably several decades and was delighted to see how it still captivated my attention with both its irreverent and nonsensical (intentional at that) plot and its outrageous (in the best possible way) visuals. Second, speaking of those visuals, the Blu-ray treatment of the movie is done masterfully. When the closing credits roll, we are informed that due to the \\"delicate nature\\" of the original movie, the update was done manually and frame-by-frame. All I can say is that the end result is fantastic. Third, as I was watching the movie, I couldn't help but think that the Beatles music featured in the movie is a further forewarning (following the earlier 2 Beatles movies) of the eventual video clip format of MTV, check out for example how \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" early in the movie is the perfect 3 min. video clip on its own. Fourth, the bonus materials (totaling about 25 min.) are nice but ultimately non-essential (for me anyway), and I doubt that I'll watch them again. The main item from these bonus materials for me were the interviews with Paul Angelis and John Clive, who provided for voices for Ringo and John, respectively, and how Eric Segal was recruited for a quick make-over of the script, but all these interviews are woefully short (1 to 2 min. each).<br /><br />All that aside, it is amazing to me that \\"Yellow Submarine\\" is celebrating its 45th anniversary this year, yet it remains as fresh and as relevant today than it was when it first came out. And I cannot say enough about the fantastic visual upgrade this Blu-ray release is. Bottom line: \\"Yellow Submarine\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!h about the fantastic visual upgrade this Blu-ray release is. Bottom line: \\"Yellow Submarine\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Watched this show weekly and now watching from the beginning for the third time.  Love it. Maggie Smith is the greatest.  A must see for all...
B00D8OHPF8|5.0|i been a joe fan since his first album everything...he has grown alot since then.He has the formula for what r&b should still be sounding like...good vocals,song writting,smooth chorus,etc...No booty shaking songs,no auto-tune filled songs,to many features.....All which joe stays away from those traps artists of today fall victim to! Joe shows he's still mr consident,stays in his box,but does try new styles..Usually a 1 to 2 songs an album...All his albums have good songs,they have 1 to 3 songs where your repeat button gets a heavy workout,lol! Here \\"magic city\\" \\" id rather have love\\" to name some...But you'll enjoy the whole album...Only thing i wish joe could have put his interlude \\"reset\\" from gospel singer issac carree's album titled reset..Which joe sung a beautiful 1:16 about God,how God can change your heart....i further hoped joe would take that interlude and make it a whole song...yea im greedy when it comes to joe..i like the previous albums,last 2 in particular signature,new man....this album is better than those...Not a bad thang regarding joe..Joe keep them albums coming! Maybe one day joe and r kelly can do a song together,two long lasting artists.

B00000DHTF|5.0|CD arrived in great condition, as promised!  The CD covers a few of the missing pieces from my Bruce and the E Street Band collection.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|The writing is superb and the structure of the novel is truly original. I had trouble at the beginning but soon was caught up in the narrative. Tying the central figure to him or herself was fascinating.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|When watching Downton Abbey you can go back in time and understand another era and see the magnificent Abbey<br />How interesting and you can be drawn in just enjoy the viewing.....
B00A7CI82I|4.0|It truly is the legacy of the Bourne trilogy. I enjoyed it. It falls in line with the others but it was nice to see a new character.  I hope a sequel follows, I will see it. A Reminder it is hard to follow in the footsteps of an established role but this character has room grow.<br />Enjoy, my friends.<br />GB
B000A7DVRC|5.0|The Dude abides. I don't know about you but I take comfort in that. It's good knowin' he's out there. The Dude. Takin' 'er easy for all us sinners. Shoosh. I sure hope he makes the finals.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Masterpiece Theater is just that - a masterpiece. Excellent story with truly talented actors/actresses. The detail in clothing and sets is wonderful.
B007H1HQW0|4.0|Fairly easy to use - a little confusing to put together. Practice on a couple of bottles before you cut the ones you want to keep.
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|If ever a film could be described as magical this is it. The incredible things these athlete, actor,performers do is balanced beautifully by the amazing sets and costumes. A delight to watch my wife and I enjoyed it so much we watched it two nights in a row. Sweet, poignant, powerful, mystical a delight for the whole family.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Probably my favorite game of this type. Good mix of puzzles, great help functions, great visuals. Really looking forward to sequel.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this series and all of the characters.  Can't wait to see what they do in season 4!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I LOVE ANIMAL FILMS...THIS ONE IS GREAT BUT WILL HAVE YOU CRYING, IT IS A WONDERFUL STORY BASED ON TRUTH..ON A RAINY DAY GET THIS FILM , SIT DOWN AND PREPARE TO FALL IN LOVE WITH THIS DOG AND HIS FAMILY....
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Absolutely wonderful acting, great story line.  Makes you apart of the Downton Abbey family.  Highly recommended.  Good for all age groups.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|engrossing as always. looking forward to the next &#34;chapter&#34;! A fun summer read without having to do much thinking!<br />Just enjoy!
B0052Z0MJW|1.0|This is one of the worst books I've ever read. It has a lot of technical mistakes, which I would have forgiven if the author would have delivered a good plot. The plot is so poor that you don't need to read all the book to know who did what and why. The lead female character, a woman who is described as smart and resourceful turns out to be an annoying creature whose lack of common sense is annoying to the reader. I think this book is an insult to the reader's time and intellect.
B005K01VZS|5.0|This is an awesome story about two very different men living very different lives and their stories as told by a third man (the author) as he observes the paths that lead all three of them to a place of maturity, spirituality and community repair and salvation.  I loved that the author described his own reactions to what was happening in the story and the honest sharing of his own humanity.  I would recommend this book for anyone who wants to be less judgemental, more kind, and more forgiving. This book is not a sappy sickening self-righteous preach.  It is more powerful than that because it points up all the weakness ordinary characters deal with daily and how faith can heal any life.  I loved it and would suggest you not pass this one up!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|\\"Heart of Obsidian\\" is the first book I read by this author. It had great character development, mystery and intrigue, wonderful romance build-up, and a great story line. I loved the fact that the author took the time to build up the romance instead of \\"plopping\\" the characters in bed immediately! I also loved the fact that the hero was somewhat of a \\"bad boy/good boy\\" type -- bad when he needed to be and good when it came to his lady! Ms. Singh actually used some four and five syllable descriptive words --what a change from some of the simplistic writing we as romance readers are exposed to. I don't normally like novels that are too futuristic, but this one introduces the reader to a whole new world, and this world is fascinating! I enjoyed the book so much that I've read five more, beginning with the first book in the series. However, so far I feel \\"Heart of Obsidian\\" is the best one! The others are good, but they don't compare with this one. I would recommend reading this one first if you haven't read any of the others -- even though this book is not the first in the series.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is a great product.  I put in several areas that I check the weather on.  Lots of options for detailed weather.
B009ZQ8FQG|2.0|kept having to load and reload and could never get it to restart where I had left off.  Other discs worked fine that one obviously flawed.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|If you are a fan of the original, you may be disapointed in this film. The plot drags on in serveral parts and seems to loose its way. Special effects are low grade and some scenes are out of focus.
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|Intense, gripping and mesmerizing!  Characters of steel, gentleness and courage. This season propels the senses to a new height of intrigue.  Surprising twists and turns maintains the excitement of 'what's next'??  The intricacies of the roles intertwine in a most unexpected way.  Series 2 is a thrilling continuation of an outstanding presentation of the era of Kings, their lives and their loves....their challenges and their defeats....their greed and their compassion......and their unrelenting quest for power.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I don't like that my pictures are not private and pop up on the right hand side asking for locations etc.  Would also like to have friends for games that aren't on my friends list that can post on my timeline.
B00AR83PN4|2.0|Had no issues installing. Hated the camera rotation buttons. Would rather swipe to rotate. Also limiting rotation to the zx plane is terrible. Neat concept. It's 3d tetris with blocks that you can't rotate. Game is too restrictive to be really fun. Allow better camera angles, allow rotation of shapes for possible 4 star rating. Also when I closed the app it crashed with a &quot;parsing error&quot; message. Not sure why or what this is but wasn't comforting.
B00BHMF578|1.0|How did this movie ever win an award, &#34;slow and boring&#34; should be the title, bens an good actor but not in this movie
B009ZQP42E|5.0|It took me a bit to get into this flick - I expected drag queen same-o, same-o...  So glad I settled in to watch as Kinky Boots has become one of my all time favorite feel good movies!  And the drag queen is good looking as both male and female - something for everyone!  Highly recommend - it will leave you dancing and wanting more!  Enjoy!
0425267695|5.0|This is an excellent book that has been out for a year or so.  The Amazon publication date of 7-2-13 is incorrect.  I thought this might have been Book 2, but in fact it is still book 1.  But if you search for book 2 you end up here.  I hope Amazon will fix this error, surely many others have been fooled as well.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|This was one of those free app-a-day things. Got good reviews so I said why not. Well...the thing loaded and never moved from the opening scene. It would just sit there playing elevator music, never doing anything.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This is a very fun game.  I love the stuff and the new dino world.  I did have more recent problems and could not get in the in app store.  I hope they fix it soon.
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|Success is a funny thing because there are what seems like a million different paths to achieve what you want in life.  What I loved about this book from James is the raw truth based on his personal ups and downs.<br /><br />As I progressed through the book I could relate to what he was saying even though my life is very different - and I think that's what makes his writing so compelling.  Regardless of where you are in life, you'll be able to get something from this book to improve.<br /><br />Thanks James!
B00CDCLL1A|5.0|Love that actors keep showing up as different characters which really brings home the theme of interconnection.  Stellar performances by Hanks and Berry.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|It was fun from beginning to end. Action & adventure throughout. Lots of the time the trailer is the only good part. This was exciting from beginning to end.
193700788X|5.0|This ties the series off nicely. I'm not sure why all the negative reviews, Harris ended the series with dignity and closure. Who could ask for more. I'll miss reading this series.

B004132HZS|5.0|I LOVE this adaptation of Sherlock. I've seen Benedict Cumberbatch in other things and I just adore him as Sherlock. He's sharp, biting, witty, smart and hilarious! His relationship with Watson (Martin Freeman) is a great friendship that you are on this Sherlock-Watson bandwagon from the get-go! If you love the books, watch this series. It is one of the closest adaptations from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's novels I've ever seen, and even if some things from the books are changed, it's done only to increase the storyline. Get it. You must watch this!
B000HKYA1I|5.0|especially if you're into learning more about the holocaust and the day to day life of Jews during that time in history.

B00913DPW2|5.0|I have just purchased The Haunt for the second time!  Since playing The Haunt 1 and 2, I have tried to recreate the experience with other games.  There is no comparison!  Some have great photography with no story line and others have great graphics but are VERY short.  Games that lure you in with a shortened version and then end unexpectantly unless you pay are so annoying.  Games that are more about hidden objects get tiresome very quickly because there is very little challenge.  When Haunt 3 comes out I will be in heaven!  Just one thing, could you please, please, please make your games available on Windows 8!  I think it would be great.  Thank you for making great mystery games!  Keep 'em coming.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Still funny, still brilliant with even more Sherlock and Watson awesomeness. Season 2 takes the relationships on Sherlock to new levels. So many fantastic, wonderful and sometimes awful things happen that your heart is either in your throat, tears are coming down your face or your belly is shaking with laughter. (Or you could even be shouting at the T.V. while you jump up and down on the couch with rage as to the injustices of the justice system. Not that happened to me.......cause it didn't........) Go ahead, just buy this. Thank me later.
B002WSASIC|5.0|Very well done movie. Very insightful and gripping. It gives perspective to a culture that some of us have never experienced first hand. After all these years, it's still going strong with new fans all the time.
0425263924|5.0|I love these characters!!! Please hurry and give me more! There are too many loose ends and Eva's parents still have no closure...<br />Thank you Sylvia Day for bringing all these characters into my home...Awesome Read!!!
B003O86FMW|2.0|I did not like this book because it w too much like the other book s . It good. To be noaring
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|downloaded and functioned fine on my first gen kindle<br /><br />my kids bugged me to get this because my sister (their aunt) plays it. it's an okay game but has some issues - the different patterened pieces are not explained - do they do different things?  - what is the best way to use the flaming diamonds? what is the best way to use the other items? there are no written explanations that I can find. also the concept of only being able to play a few times before you have to wait or pay for more hearts with real money.... hate that aspect. overall an okay game that my kids short attention spans works well with but I would rather play longer.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|First time watching on a new big-screen, HD. Smooth play, no interruptions in the internet connection. Plus, the movie is he!!a cool.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|please finish this series it cant end like it did without some cure<br />why do i have to type more
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|John is not as sassy as he used to be but I still enjoy his interaction with &#34;bad guys&#34; . I would pay to see it again.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|The first half is very good; a standard Bond film with tributes to all previous Bonds (since it is a 50th anniverry film). But the second half has no majesty, just guy against guy fight.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Dis is a totally fun game. You should definitely download it. I would recommend it to anyone!!! Good graphics too.
B00992CF6W|5.0|best game ever I built a huge house on a map and it is still not glitchy like computer version you really need to by it
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game is great besides the fact it requires WiFi to do anything so Stuart home prop your feet up and enjoy the awesome game play 10stars
B000M64BIE|5.0|I found this gem of a book at a used bookstore, except that the book was in mint condition, even the nameplate sticker had not been filled out or affixed yet. Being a Janeite, I have been collecting various leather-bound editions and Folio editions of Austen's works since I was out of college and I couldn't resist getting this.<br /><br />The book is beautiful and the cover picture here doesn't do it justice. The book is bound in genuine leather in a deep ochre color with gilt edging, and a satin ribbon marker. This title is part of Easton Press' Famous Editions series (not to be confused by Easton's The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written)and was published in 1983. The pages are incredibly well-preserved which leads me to infer the book was printed on acid free paper since there are no age spots whatsoever. There is a preface by Stella Gibbons and the book also comes with beautiful color illustrations by Fritz Kredel. This is an heirloom quality book that can be enjoyed by generations to come and I'm happy to add it to my personal library of classic works.
B000J1AGQI|4.0|When Mel Gibson isn't spewing out anti-Semitic slurs, he's been in some decent movies, and this is one of them. Focused on the first major encounter between U.S. troops and the North Vietnamese, in the Ia Drang valley, the movie gives more attention to the home fronts than is typical. Going beyond the standard Hollywood romantic scenes, it shows some of the toil that war takes on those left behind, and even has a brief acknowledgement that African American soldiers were fighting for their country in Asia while being denied civil rights at home.<br />The movie also puts some human face on the North Vietnamese, although they mostly get mowed down by the vastly superior American firepower. The NVA had a huge numerical advantage, though, putting the 7th Cavalry units in dire straits for two days (there was more action in the Ia Drang, where Americans fared very poorly, but that's not depicted in the film). The battle scenes are well done, and the recreation of the close artillery and air support is extremely good.<br />If you like war flicks and don't mind movies featuring Mel Gibson, this is worth seeing. More straightforward than classic Vietnam films--Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now, Platoon--more jingoistic than the latter two, but a little more realistic view of the North Vietnamese then most others.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|It's great as a travel clock. I use it often.<br />One down side is that my firewall reports it as adware and keeps wanting to remove it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I purchased this program to use in our adult Sunday School class at our church.  It installed easily and functions great.  I installed this program on both my iPhone-5 and my iPad-2.  It is easy to use and allows the reader to select from a large variety of Biblical translations.  My wife and I love this program and I believe you will too.  Thank you Amazon.com!
B007YZQVZM|5.0|\\"Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl\\" has come to mean different things to me as I've grown older - when I first read it as a ten-year-old girl, I was fascinated by the hidden life she led with her family and there was a sense of dread and excitement about her precarious circumstances, the danger of being discovered. When I read Anne's diary again as a teenager, I came to empathize with Anne's frustrations with her mother and the other adults around her whom Anne felt did not understand her and treated her as a child. I felt Anne's desire to be 'heard' and not just treated as an inconvenience or child was so much aligned with what I was going through during adolescence.<br /><br />When I re-read the diary as an adult, I came to appreciate all the other things - the tragedy of having lost such an amazing and talented young voice in the most horrible of circumstances; the beauty of Anne's writing which is all the more amazing given how young she was when she wrote this diary; and the themes of alienation, fear, and hope. Now, as the mother of a young daughter, I read this diary again and gain another fresh perspective - of the complex relationship between daughter and mother. Anne had a strained relationship with her mother Edith, and clearly gravitated toward her beloved Pim (father). This was obvious even before Anne and her family were compelled to move into hiding in the Annex. As a mother, reading Anne's thoughts about her mother (often unflattering) was a disconcerting experience, though things do improve somewhat later on.<br /><br />Anne Frank's Diary of a Young Girl is a classic not only of Holocaust literature, but also a classic Young Adult read with its myriad themes that will appeal to both adolescents and adult readers.
B005H9B44A|5.0|Another! Lolol GREAT movie and a lot of fun to watch. They did a good job balancing the comical side of the movie with the serious side. 5 stars!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This is a fun and easy to use game, I only wish it had more guns to choose from.<br />Hope more are coming soon.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I thought it would be easy but not so much and you really must pay attention to details but once completed a great feeling
B00BVYU2P2|4.0|I hope this isn't even close to how high school is now, but it's a very funny show, great characters, reminds me at different times of Dougie Howser, Wonder Years, and Community.  Highly recommend.
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|Well this product look like a great bargain but I still evaluated if this a great buy or a buff, work properly in some condictions. In another can be a problem.
B006C67NP6|5.0|I just thought I'd add my 5-star review, especially now that they've added guitar chord formations (it's an additional $4.99 purchase, but well worth it).  This is the ultimate practice tool for me (I play guitar, bass and keys).  The number of songs available is huge and growing every day, and not jazz standards, either - there are plenty of pop and rock songs on hand as well.<br />If you take the time to learn all the functions, just about everything you need is there - check out the video tutorials.  I'm going to have to install Bluestacks on my pc so that I can run irealb on it!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I haven't read Stephen King for a long time, but this book has me believing in him again.  I can't put it down or get it off my mind.
B000002AHM|5.0|Get this album.  I heard them on the same tour that this album was created on (minus one, replaced by someone that was darn good).  It still stuns me what these guys can do with a guitar.  And I have for years been trying to find music like this, some have come close, but this one is the best.
B00ATUEKY8|4.0|I still cannot read this book without following the character down that rabbit hole... I have to stop reading for awhile to regain my own footing. It's that well written even after all these years.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Continues in the same manor of the first book.  The story is great, and can't wait for the third book.
B0090KZDSK|4.0|Loved it. Nice change of pace from the normal romance books out there. Have already given it to family and friends.
B002KKCW8Q|4.0|The Teva tanza is a good comfortable sandle. The only drawback so far is the foot area could use a little more texture to keep your foot from sliding when they get wet. Not quite as good as my last teva's in that respect but otherwise they are pretty good.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I know people like that...scarry! Gillian Flynn you have the IT! This is must read before any marriage agreement...In other words don't get married until you know this story and then engage for long long time so you may avoid your own personal gone girl.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Great Game Our Son loves it ~ So funny how they pick it up so quickly ~ ! Thanks, B, T and J
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|The story is strong and classic, the variety of acting characters are all interesting. I got a bit worn down by the visits to prison re  housekeeping staff. I feel terrible about the ending character who is apparently dead. Scenery is convincing and a period statement.
145210655X|5.0|This is adorable!  Now that the &#34;Vader's Little Princess&#34; is out I will have to buy that as well.  It is a sturdy board book, the drawings are great and it gets quite a few chuckles from the adults reading it.  It is more geared towards the geeky parents than the baby, but it is kid friendly and eventually the geeklings will understand what all the fuss is about.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Took a long time to download on my Kindle.  I was trying to do it at the airport so it could have a lot to do with the wi-fi available.  It's a great movie!!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway,surfers is a very awesome game it is a game of agility and fast moving hands I really recommend it
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Just as good as we hoped! If you're a Downton Abbey fan, you know what to expect...and this season won't disappoint you!
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|really enjoyed this jewel game...can't wait for the sequel to this one!!!  My young nephews loved this game and told me they couldn't wait for the next one
B00D02Z1EA|5.0|I've been a fan of ABR since I first heard Constellations.  So when I heard they had a new album coming out, I was stoked.  And they didn't disappoint.  The music is blistering in its intensity and beautiful in its execution.  Their vocals are perfect and I love how they've mixed growled, screamed, and clean vocals.  My favorite songs of this album that demonstrate this mix are Beauty In Tragedy and Spirit Breaker.<br />Additionally, I love the meaning behind Beauty In Tragedy.  Such a beautiful song.  I highly recommend this album.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|A super ending.  Leads to some interesting conversations afterwards.<br />Acting was very good.  Interesting story line.  I might read the book now!<br /><br />Well done!
B005MMY9A8|5.0|this review is from my 9 year old, he absolutely loves the show so much he watches it over and over again!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can't wait for season 4. Season 3 does not disappoint and has a very dramatic cliffhanger! More character development, new characters, and exciting plot lines make watching season 3 a joy.  Plus lots of babies!
B000001GE5|5.0|Whenever I read a rapturous customer review on Amazon my guard goes up instantly... \\"Are they out of control?  Or crazy?\\" I often wonder.  So it is with some trepidation that I offer the rapturous praise richly deserved by Maurizio Pollini's playing of Chopin on this recording.  Anyone with even a passing interest in classical music will have heard these pieces several times before, but the freshness and intensity of Pollini's rendition makes these well-known melodies sound brand new.  Vigor, sensitivity, nuance, clarity, precision... all the richness and variety are beautifully preserved on this well-engineered recording....there really is nothing to criticize here.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Fun game...well worth the dollar...lots of different types of plagues each needs a new strategy to beat. One of the best games in kindled very limited roster
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have trouble sleeping and have been implementing various things to try to help me fall asleep.  This app is one of the things that works the best. And I really enjoy all the extra content with the paid version. Especially the whale sounds.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|An impressive embodiment of the actual book character.  The end is spectacular.  Johnny Lee Miller is my favorite Nightly.  Swoon-worthy!
B006QF61VA|5.0|I watched this movie when it first came out in the 1980's and loved it, still do.  Worth watching for the scenery, content and storyline.
B00B6U63ZE|5.0|The 3 month rule was something I discovered when I served in the Navy. I learned that with each new assignment every three years that starting off with a clean slate was critical in first impressions, so I worked harder than anyone else in my division and kept my mouth shut while keeping my eyes and ears open for spotting an opportunity to either help someone on my team or learn something on my own. This book helped me refine that experience and apply it to a corporate environment. It has served me well in my last two career changes
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I tried to play it once, I did not like seems too complicated---makes me have to think--I do not want to
B001974DG0|5.0|To many people, this is Dean Knootz's best work and it is hard to believe that this was written before Trixi, his beloved fur face, ever came into his life--although after reading this I can see why he wanted a golden.  I don't want to allow the reader any give aways on the plot, however, any person who ever owned a dog will see in the dog in this book as a dream come true.  As for the writing, Knootz is a master at blending the mysteries of human love, human depravity, and an at times wicked sense of humour.  He makes you care about these people and even pity a creature that cannot be pitied.  His view of the NSA is rather appropriate during our present problems and where they might go.  You will laugh in this book.  You will hurt in this book.  Yu will want more of these character, unfortunately, Mr. Knootz is adamant (or so it seems) about a sequel.  Well, there is always Odd Thomas!
0307271080|5.0|Anyone is Nigerian decent living in America can completely relate.  Chimamanda does a great job merging the two cultures: both Nigerian and American in her book. She speaks from an African perspective living &#34;the American Life.&#34;  She speaks of the challenges that most Nigerians face when arriving and adjusting to America.  It is a funny book because you can hear the accents and dialog among the characters.  As a Nigerian born American, I proud of what this author has done.  I hope she continues to write books like this and &#34;Half of A Yellow Sun.&#34;
B00DHQHAH0|4.0|Really enjoy this show, it gets 4/5 because I reserve 5's for some of the truly outstanding dramas out there such as justified, game of thrones, etc.  my wife and I both really enjoy this show.
0061452068|5.0|A realistic examination of the essential component in all human development from stone age to the present time. How all progress has been dependent on trade at every level. should we have free trade or revert to protectionist policies in times of strife. Should we be fearful for the future and the catastrophes that are regularly predicted. Is the human race capable of overcoming the challenges predicted from global warming, population explosion, depletion of resources. This book will alter your outlook on life.
0062255657|4.0|Anyone familiar with Neil Gaiman will know what to expect; a world where fantasy sits just on the periphery of our own mundane reality, and only truly reveals itself to the central character of the story.  The focal character who serves, initially, as a foil to the new world in which he finds himself, is flung into the center of a struggle that he is not prepared to handle or even understand.  This combination of qualities makes for thoroughly enjoyable reading, particularly those with vivid imaginations, as they get to share in the wonder and emotion of discovering and navigating this new world along with the main protagonist, and this newest installment is vintage Gaiman.<br /><br />But Ocean at the End of the Lane differs from Gaiman's previous novels in one major way - it is fairly brief compared to his other novels.  There's not the same sense of epic adventure that accompanied previous novels like Neverwhere, American Gods, or even the Graveyard Book.  And while there's a sense of danger that surrounds the main character, it is so vaguely defined that I wasn't really sure whether the entity that plagues the protagonist is maliciously violent, or a mostly harmless troublemaker that doesn't truly pose any real threat.  This might have been a more compelling question if the book hadn't been so coy with details and backstory.  Unlike Neverwhere's terrifying duo of Croup and Vandemar, who we come to understand as ancient agents of chaos and destruction, I'm still not really sure what to make of the main antagonist of TOATEOTL.<br /><br />This weak danger is only mollified by the exceedingly powerful entities that ally themselves with the main character.  At no point when he is with them is there ever the sense that something bad could happen to him; their combined knowledge and power border on god-like, and only when he wanders outside of their sphere of protection is he ever open to anything even remotely bad happening to him.  Midway through the book, whatever suspense there was had (at least for me) exhausted itself, and I felt myself becoming more disinterested through the remaining chapters until just before the conclusion.<br /><br />Up to this point, this review may come off as incredibly negative, but I had also read it while consciously comparing it to his previous novels, and this review reflects the light in which I read it.  This is still a worthwhile read and while I think that this is a really wonderful story, it is a fairly short read (I finished it in a couple sittings) and it could have benefitted from a bit more elaboration and exploration of the peripheral world, which is one of the qualities that make Gaiman novels such a delight to read.  Nonetheless, what is in the pages is presented vividly and those who enjoy Gaiman's unique form of storytelling will be glad for another opportunity to experience it.spense there was had (at least for me) exhausted itself, and I felt myself becoming more disinterested through the remaining chapters until just before the conclusion.<br /><br />Up to this point, this review may come off as incredibly negative, but I had also read it while consciously comparing it to his previous novels, and this review reflects the light in which I read it.

B008220D7S|3.0|Although I expected this movie to be a lot more funnier, I did have a good laugh.  Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd make an awesome onscreen husband and wife couple!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The people who made this game should be proud of what they made over never been on a game that is so good.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|A great blend of real history interwoven into the fictional storyline.  I loved the first book and this one was just as good.  Looking forward to picking up the third book in the series.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Nothing like a summer thriller to keep me happy. Well written, enough turns and twists to satisfy any Baldacci fan.
B0093H8HXS|5.0|excellent performance comming for a budget processor!! games fly with these thing!! i play league of legends, dota 2, skyrim, starcraft 2, diablo 3, etc
B00CATSONE|4.0|For a long while I was excited about Tesla's life and even made the Tesla coil myself. But the story of fighting between Tesla (and alternate current) and Edison (and direct current), which still shapes our everyday life, was unclear for me. Not any more. Well detailed and lively written bio. Recommended.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft was the best game I've ever played. I have recommended it to everyone I know. I don't know how I would spend my time without. I LOVE MINECRAFT.
B006JPML7K|5.0|Great movie for kids and adults alike!  As good as the first!  We can't wait for Kung Fu Panda 3!
B00CL1SR7O|5.0|This album is there best yet! There young and mature. They know they have a more of a younger audience & try to keep things non sexual, unlike other bands (1D). They're really talented and underrated because they work for Nickolodean... it's sad because they're more talented than 98% of artist on the radio. CAN'T WAIT FOR THEIR NEXT ALBUM!
B0092S4WLY|4.0|Got to find clues whicj enable you to open the doors and move to the next floor. keeps you thinking
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love i love it! my cousin got me playing this game, very addictive, easy to play, go hard or go home with this
B00007GZQI|5.0|needed a copy of this saw one in Amazon decided to buy it very happy with purchase just what I wanted
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|It was ok I thought it was going to be better than the last one but it was not but it was ok.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|After all the hype about this movie we finally got around to watching it. My husband started dozing about half way through. I had a bit more tolerance and actually was able to stay awake to the finish (maybe because we stopped half way and watched it the next day, lol). I think maybe you have to be 14-18 years old to really enjoy it, though I know quite in their 20's who loved it. I actually found it a bit boring...all that &#34;sleeping sitting up in a tree&#34; nonsense. Woody Harrelson was very good in it though. I hear there will be a sequel. Oh goody, lol.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I FRIGGEN LOVE THIS APP! VERY GOOD ,  GREAT WAY TO DL MOVIES IF YOU HAVE INTERNET TROUBLE AND NEED SOMETHING TO WATCH
B001AVCFJM|5.0|hadn't seen the movie yet saw it offered at Amazon so I decided to buy it I really enjoyed the movie a great one to keep in my collection
B00280LYIM|5.0|I thought that this was the best percy Jackson book ever I loved the details &words of pan and the details of kampe  swords and I loved the part about dadaulas and dadaulas
B0081336FO|5.0|Excellent. Funny, witty, and totally entertaining. Very excited that they are back at work on this show. Can't wait for season 3!
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Have been wanting to read this book for a while! It was different then any others I've read because it was narrated by death. It may sound dark but it played well into the story. I loved the main character for her bravery and her determination.
8862933177|5.0|I just received this Journal and found it very useful.  Love the layout and simplicity of it.  Wrote my first review of \\"World War Z\\" on the first page, as I, too, decided not to use the alphabetized tabs of it.  Instead I put little sticker of \\"thumbs up\\" over the letter.  I think it is easier for me.  Pages are of very good quality, so I ordered three more Passion journals: travel, gardening, and recipe.  Highly recommend to everyone.
B000FC12SM|3.0|Worthwhile read.  I came away with some valuable ideas (or maybe I just remembered them).<br />I especially found immediately useful the section on using the right words to ask for what I want.<br />Great reminder that the genders ARE different.
B000FC1MCS|4.0|Loved this book.  A good mystery and life experience from the view point of autistic teenager.  Look for the Monty Hall challenge, amazing.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Excellent! Good plot, new sneaky information from the consultants, wonderful acting and actors who know how to act--not the celebrity types. There are a couple of &#34;oh, yeah, I've seen that before moments&#34;, but generally it worked well on all levels.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Hooked once again,  watched it in a marrying session!  My advice,  spread it out, so you don't have to wait so long to see more.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Good game but Itunes has the next update 0.7.2 out and this one is not compatable with it for multi player so I can no longer game with my son until this app is updated. I hope it is soon.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenging escapes.  Can't wait for new levels.  Get your brain in gear by playing this little gem.  Glad I downloaded. Vindog
B0095P33IW|3.0|It's fun, but silly as it's taken from a comic book. Worth a Saturday afternoon watch while doing something else cause the plot is not difficult to keep up with.
B0087GYY92|5.0|A great meta look on how to get on with life when you're not the main character.  Only minor Star Trek knowledge required.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|I just got this App for Flowpaper and I love it.  It lets the creative spirit go unleashed.  You can print it and make a wrap for a small gift. or you can make yourself a print to frame.  The possibilities are unlimited.
B000QGAU4E|3.0|Clive Owen is a wonderful actor and the movies simply wasted his talent, I thought. Otherwise, the plot was OK, not great. I suppose it was meant to be a wake-up call to the public at large, but fell short in my opinion.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|The book has no main character, but the zombies are a fantastic common thread. Brooks has you re-imagining zombies in fantastical ways. It isn't so much action/adventure (though of course there is that,too) as much as it is a study in human nature and the human spirit. I liked it, and recommend it to anyone who enjoys George Romero style mental imagery. If you don't understand the last sentence,this book is probably not for you. Enjoy!
B00CRS88IO|5.0|This is the story about the person that made the stories.  If you like James Bond you will love the Ian Fleming story.  As former U.S. Military I also appreciated the story itself.  Great Job and I look forward to the next Ian Fleming story.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I would give it five stars except it wants you to buy stuff. My grandson had rang up $5.00 in charges before I relized what was happening :(.
B007TKT2SK|4.0|I picked this up as a Free App of the Day, and I really like it.  I'm accustomed to working with decimals, and I have a hard time switching to fractions when I leave the engineering world and pick up a hammer and saw. Of course, I could convert all of my plans to decimal feet, but that would take a ridiculous amount of time!<br /><br />I like this calculator because it allows me to focus on the task at hand, rather than sit around and try to reduce a bunch of fractions so that I can make the right cut.  For people who have worked in construction for any length of time, I bet this isn't an issue.  But for guys like me, who are just getting into this kind of thing after a LONG time of dealing exclusively in decimals, this is a handy little gadget.
B00CH26TL8|2.0|This game is a lot of fun, it's addictive, but I think the developers designed it to make people broke.... a game should be fun, the bubbles comes up in ways that makes it almost impossible to hit the target, if you want a good ball, it's pay, limited lives, if you want more lives.... pay, if you unlock a charm (or something like that) to use it, you gotta paaaaaaaay..... it's just too much money, without that set back, it'll be fine....make the game for a price up front..... or at least your winning coins should allow someone to use them for some game purchases.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|my daughter and I really love this movie. It was cute and it was sweet and it was sincere and it was really watch. the best friends were so funny.
B005PK57NU|5.0|Series includes something for everyone, always a case to solve, real life characters, various personalities and their lives and loves, plus family conflicts and resolutions.
B00DEG4Z1W|2.0|This game would be ok if you were rich. You have to buy everything or the game will be lame. If you were looking for a fun game I suggest you don't pick this one.
B006N0YWGY|3.0|Well, I like the idea. Even the buying, selling stuff is kind of a good idea. But the game is to small to get it right.<br />The boat racing is ok, but there's no pressure. Yeah, there's a time limit, but even when you crash into every house you'll manage to get in time. And there's police, but I don't know what they are doing. Again: no pressure to get rid of them.<br /><br />The design is fun, there are cool elements in the game, but to me, there are no real challenges in the game.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I was skeptical about this book and it took me a short while to decide to buy it. However, once I started reading  it I couldn't stop. I was fascinated by the story of Ender Wiggins and was very impressed with the story. I am glad I purchased it and you will probably be glad too.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I completed Quell and Quell Reflect, and was wondering whether there would be anything new about Quell Memento. Remarkably, the programmers and writers have come up with a beautiful game with novel Quell-like challenges.<br /><br />Quell Memento presents the recollection of a life and a love throughout the game. The ending is very sweet and touching as the protagonist and his love are reunited forever. The challenge level is perfect: not too tough and not too easy. I used \\"coins\\" that I had earned through completing a challenge in the minimum number of moves to unlock several of the tougher levels near the end. You can purchase more \\"coins\\" if you need to, but I didn't find it necessary. You also get to collect jewels and find secret levels. I am going back now to collect jewels that I had missed on my find time through. Note: you can't pick up the jewel and complete the game in the minimum number of moves. You have to go through at least twice.<br /><br />Quell Memento allows multiple players to play, so you may only need one for the family. I am not sure how many players it will allow.<br /><br />A wonderful game and probably the best game that I have ever played.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B006PKQQJS|5.0|My five year old got this app on her Nabi 2 and it works great, she loves it.  It allows for great problemsolving, time management and organizational skills as well as how to spend money wisely.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love the game the only down side is there is not enough levels and you usually have to wait a long time for more.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I just love minecraft I build tree house's. I really like survival with the gohsts the creepers and the zombies.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My 5 year old wanted temple run like her older brothers have on their devices.  Was so pleased to find temple run that would work on the Nabi 2.  Love it works great!!
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I bought Lana's album because I kept hearing about it, and I was not disappointed. Her music is moving and deep. I'm a massive Ed Sheeran fan and her music is similar to his. It's pensive and no matter what kind of mood you're in, the music applies. I have listened to this album over and over, constantly humming the tunes. It's definitely worth it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show still holds me after three seasons. I am sad that I have to wait so long for the next season.
B00D2K40WY|2.0|While my daughter really wanted to play this app, it didn't work with the tablet she has.  Can't really review because we didn't read details enough before getting this kindle app for a non kindle tablet
B00687Q0VC|5.0|I love the entire collection.  It's my second favorite of all time, after Gone With the Wind.  Paul Giamatti was excellent as John Adams.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|My Kindle storage was getting low, and I really didn't have all that much stored on it. I went to an Amazon forum and Clean Master was mentioned several times. I thought I would try it out, and I am so glad I did. It took less than a minute to install and less than a minute to clean out all of the wasted space. I am very pleased. It did exactly as it said it would, without any kind of headache. Great App, easy to use, highly suggested.
B0081336FO|5.0|Can't wait to see more. This is a hit. Sharp, witty, good camera work, add more action and slow motion and it will rival the theater versions.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|a great dvd for family viewing. the story line has features whitch both adults and children will enjoy.  a great watch for those rainy days.
1781162646|4.0|Reading Stephen King's Joyland is a fine way to spend a summer afternoon. I remember hearing talk some years ago of retirement for America's greatest storyteller, and that would have been a shame. Some of his best work has been released in recent years (I think I'm going to re-read Duma Key this summer), and Joyland is yet another top-notch effort.<br /><br />King writes place so well, and the eponymous amusement park situated on coastal Carolina is pitch perfect. He nails the authenticity of climate and the gentile mannerisms here (Mrs. Shoplaw reminds me of at least a half dozen southern women I know here in Florida), and I really enjoyed the carny speak. It's a ghost story with a little summer romance thrown in and a sad complication with a little boy and a terrible illness. Told in the first person, it's vintage King--think Bag of Bones with a much younger male protagonist and you're getting pretty close.<br /><br />Even if the mystery is a bit telegraphed, it's still an example of really fine writing. King's voice is rich with humor and those keen observational insights that lead to a nuanced, well-rendered narrative. Nobody in fiction can quite break your heart the way King does, and you'll feel it here in the final pages as well.<br /><br />King remains at the top of his game, not only for the narrative chops that lead to such clear examinations of the human condition, but also for the depth of variety he brings to the table. This is mostly a straight-ahead thriller, though there is a little speculative element in the ghost story. I'm hoping that Dr. Sleep is a return to horror with a harder edge, but even if it's a more atmospheric piece, as is the case with Joyland, it'll likely be a worthy follow-up to The Shining.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Can't wait to see more. This is a hit. Sharp, witty, good camera work, add more action and slow motion and it will rival the theater versions.
B00BCOQSSQ|2.0|It had potential, but it felt kind of flat. The narration is not so great and he could of expanded more on details. You can see his influence of Lord of the Rings and other epic fantasy stories, but sadly I don't feel he will be one of them. There was little character development apart from when he stated in a few lines that the main character was better at transporting himself and focusing. This is a story that if I would recommend, I would recommend to a 10-11 year old.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Great way to kill time. Will draw you in. Downloaded just for fun and now having hard time turning off.
0307887448|1.0|This book left me completely frustrated. The idea sounded fun, but the execution was so horrible I could barely finish. And as someone who consumes a lot of popular fiction purely for entertainment, that's saying a lot. I don't need my reading material to be strikingly original. I enjoy reading the same well-worn tropes and story lines over and over. But this was such a poorly-executed specimen of the genre, it actually made me angry. It was like the author wasn't even trying.<br /><br />If I could give Ernest Cline one piece of writing advice, it would be, &#34;murder your darlings.&#34;<br /><br />As many people have already mentioned, Ready Player One is chock-full of references to video games and 80s pop culture, but in this case more is not always better. Often, the action came to an abrupt halt so that Wade (the narrator) could explain a video game for 10 pages. There was more explaining than there was action, and even though the plot moved along fairly quickly, it still felt like slow going since there was so much exposition to wade through.<br /><br />The problem, I think, is that Cline had too many ideas and didn't know how to edit himself. He started thinking of cool things he would want to see in this world -- nothing altogether original, unfortunately -- and couldn't stop. Things that are not even relevant to the plot are explained simply because the author thought they were cool, which felt indulgent and immature. Wade's car, for instance, is a Delorean from the Back to the Future movies, but it has an onboard computer system named KITT (from Knight Rider) and Ghostbusters logos on the doors. Overkill, much? There is no point to any of this information except LOOK HOW AWESOME THIS CAR IS, IT'S AWESOME RIGHT?? It wasn't enough to just give him a Delorean; Cline had to cram in as many references as possible and make it the greatest car ever in existence, which seemed to be his approach to this entire novel. Because he couldn't choose which details and references were most important, because he couldn't &#34;kill his darlings,&#34; the book was weighed down in page after page of him describing and explaining things that don't actually matter.<br /><br />It also felt like Cline didn't really know what he wanted to do with this world he'd envisioned, except [insert generic storytelling elements here], and then spoiler alert, the hero wins! The set-up is described in excruciating detail, but the action itself feels like Cline got bored and wanted to skip ahead. There were countless scenes where he would spend several paragraphs explaining a video game (with extra info no one needed), tell us how Wade had &#34;mastered&#34; the game years ago, and then spend two sentences telling the reader that he beats the game and moves on. No sense of suspense whatsoever. &#34;This happens, then this happens, and then somehow this happens too!&#34;<br /><br />Wade's character is incredibly indulgent. He's mastered every video game in existence, and apparently did so over a span of 5 years, during which time he had also seen every 80's movie and television show dozens of times and was an expert on all of these things. He had no weaknesses, no flaws, which created zero suspense for the reader. If there's no doubt he's going to beat [video game] or get through the next challenge, why am I even reading?<br /><br />The love story was generic and made me feel nothing. I had no idea why they loved each other. They engage in a few &#34;witty&#34; conversations (the dialogue was stilted and embarrassingly bad, not actually witty at all) and then Cline TELLS US that they fall in love over a span of several weeks. Once again, we're expected to fill in the details and suspense by ourselves.<br /><br />So many deus ex machinas in this book, holy cow. They just kept getting bigger and more unbelievable as the story went on, until I didn't even bother rolling my eyes anymore. The action felt completely contrived.<br /><br />Bottom line: I finishedthe book. I was entertained by the plot, by virtue of the fact that I enjoy the genre and have low standards. I was distracted by how often I wanted to take a red pen to the book, mail it to Ernest Cline, and tell him to rewrite the entire thing. I don't know why his editors didn't do this before it was published. It's unbelievable to me that this book has so many positive reviews.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This application is wonderful and fun.  It makes reading easy and accessible.  Where have you been all my life, KINDLE?
B005544TRQ|5.0|I would recommend this show to anyone who has ever wanted to become a lawyer!  The encompassing premise is interesting, and each episode has its own independent storyline.  It is full of wit and charm and the characters are easily likeable, even the detestable ones!  I am on Season 2 right now, can't wait til Season 3 airs!
B008JF8O9M|5.0|I downloaded this just to see if it works & it does. I wanted wireless printing & I got it. Works great.
B006LRUVUA|4.0|This app is unbelievably useful. The only reason it doesn't have a five star rating is that there's an occasional chunk of crippling lag. Usually it works perfectly.
0553573403|5.0|Martin is a great writer and I would recommend it to anyone who loves fantasy, intrigue, and excitement. Buy this Book!
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|As a big fan of quite of few of the actors in this film such as Dame Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon and Billy Connolly, I was pleased to not only thoroughly enjoy myself but to also find some new favorites. I believe that we all think about the years to come accompanied with a sense of uncertainty or even dread for some of us. This film, for me, provided a glimpse into what that could be tossing aside unnecessary fears and worry for a sense of hopefulness.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really like it. It is a lot of fun. It is my favorite game. You should try it. You will like it.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love this series. I've been watching since the first season. Highclere Castle is magnificent. The period costumes are gorgeous & I love all the characters. Can't wait to see Season 4!
0307951154|2.0|Lost track and found it dragged on. Didn't finish it. Maybe I read too many in a row. Still not as good as Camilla Lackberg.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I am finally able to relax either after a rough day @ work or even relax while reading before I fall asleep without. that horrible &amp; irritating ringing.  I have the perfect combination of rain thunder wind chimes &amp; frogs the does the trick.  Love this app!!!
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|The plot was great, suspenseful, however somewhat predictable. The characters were believable and endearing. Loved it and would see it again.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|So my sister saw this movie last year in theaters and said it was great. I myself was like oh great another comic book turned movie character. I didn't really think anything about it. I didn't think about the fact that my 6 yr old knew characters and thought they were cool, until last week when our church had VBS and they used superheroes as their theme, there was Spiderman, Batman, and so forth, but they did 2 songs about Superheros and how God was better, so I got to thinking about the movie. Yesterday I went on Amazon Prime Instant movies and found it, then I watched it. As of 10 minutes ago, I just watched it again.<br /><br />Epic battle scenes. Iron Man v Thor, then Hulk V Thor, Black Widow V Hawkeye, Hulk smashing any nand everything in sight. Hulk man handling Loki like a rag doll. Iron Man going right through the alien machine. The final battle when they all can together was the best. As the old adage says there's no I in TEAM. It's just a great movie for kids and adults alike.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini is such a wonderful story teller. I love the way he intertwines people's lives. An his prose is almost lyrical at times.
B00D3V85FA|5.0|If you enjoy classic hard and heavy rock, you can't go wrong with this album. Sounds like classic sabbath with a fresh new sound
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|I watched Marvel Avengers 1st, but I saw the previews for Captain America when it came out in theaters. I am truly glad that i watched it yesterday. It's a really great movie about a courageous guy. No matter what they said, no matter how the odds were stacked against them, he proved them wrong every time.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I think its a fun time spending game I would definatly recommend to others into Sim games like The Sims but looking for a free version
B00BQPEIT2|2.0|I was excited about the look of the game and enjoyed earning the basics but soon learned that I needed too many &#34;jewels&#34; and &#34;coins&#34; that had to be bought, in order to continue for any amount of time. It is a shame because I do not plan to continue paying in order to enjoy the game,
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I'm not sure if this is suppose to be the last book in this series, I sure hope not. The author did a wonderful job of tying upa whole host of loose ends that you sometimes didn't even know were hanging there until then. Oh and the romance that I would never expected from the main character was both hot and completely believable with the leading lady's trauma, with them facing it and dealing with the aftermath rather than just blowing it off. It's certainly a must read but if you are new to this author then you should beware.this isNOT a stand alone book, it is pay off an ongoing and beautifully complex series and should be read in the correct order of you truly want to enjoy it properly.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|One of the best shows on TV if not the best. I watched all three seasons in a matter of weeks and stayed up WAY too late doing so but it is so addicting. I give it two BIG thumbs up!!
B00CH26TL8|2.0|Although it advertised working on my phone (on which I read Kindle books), it then said it would not work after it was loaded.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Hard to believe the movie was based on this book. Almost everything is different<br />In the book from the way they deal with zombies to how the story is told. This isn't great literature but It's a pretty quick read and I found it enjoyable if you like the zombie genre.
B002APU580|5.0|Love, love, love this version of P&P!  Bought it so I can watch it whenever I want because it's one of those movies you want to watch every year.
B006N0YWGY|2.0|No speed control.... full throttle or nothing.  Childish &#34;left-right&#34; directional control, (touch the left or right side of screen)  Graphics were good.  But honestly, Rip Tide is SIGNIFICANTLY better.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is the fist book I have read by Hosseini and the best story I have read in a long time. I can't wait to read his earlier works.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is genius, the cast, the writing, the plots, the scripts, and Maggie Smith is especially entertaining.  My only regret is there aren't more episodes.
B005OT2YVA|4.0|Good movie to watch but a little slow at times and hard to understand the speaking at times. But very good. May be too harsh for young kids to watch.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|Just like it is in real life. I cried and I laughed. One of the best rom com of all time
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|My daughter is obsessed with Holidays and all the magical characters that come with being a kid. This movie is fun way to enjoy thos characters without braking out the Holiday movies.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|Adult enough to interest adults. It starts off slow in B & W but gets much better once he gets to OZ. Some really good acting surprisingly enough. Would recommend to anyone looking to entertain their family without the worry of adult themes.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I haven't played Magic in a few years and this app definitely helped me get back on the horse! The graphics are absolutely beautiful! The gameplay is easy to figure out and plays just like a card game. I have a first gen Kindle Fire and while it took awhile to download and install, I have had no space issues. I would definitely reccomend this to any fan of MTG.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|I installed this on an Acer Iconia and it will not fit to the screen. I cannot start a game even because any option buttons are apparently off screen.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Clean good fun, suspenseful and has you on the edge of your seat in parts. Definitely recommend for family viewing.
B00D8RYV52|1.0|I love Dr. Panda! Their apps are the best, my 3 yr old loves the games they keep her entertained and are easy for her to understand how to play in every app. But this app doesn't even work! It always shuts down on her! Till this day she still hasn't played panda garage!
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Very fun game. You get to buy (in game money) power ups. You also help to build a town around the tree.
B00BESFWBY|5.0|Jay Moriarty.... Inspiration long after he has left this planet. Great movie, great show of the fortitude it takes to be the best in your craft. Heartfelt emotion throughout at the challenges he faced, and the life he lived. He overcame challenging odds to be what he wanted to be. Fantastic Family choice but may be boring to young children. No Adult themes in it at all. Just good clean, inspirational fun.
B000HF2NTE|4.0|I grew up in the '80s so back then it was either Stallone or Schwarznegger who really did good action movies. I like them both and their work. Stallone did a pretty good job in Cobra, being the cop who'd clean up the \\"trash\\" when all else fails . He's not a bad actor and I'd watch Rambo or Rocky all over again.
0374533555|5.0|One of the best book I have ever read on the subject of the human mind and its inner workings.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I thought it was going to be another adolescent novel, but it really delved into topics that were painful and generally unspoken. I really enjoyed the writing and the characters created by Steven Chbosky.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I loved this book, the whole series is fantastic and I would highly recommend it to anyone that likes science fiction.
1607066017|3.0|My biggest complaint with this work is the writing choices made by the author.  He envesioned this new world with new races yet they talk exactly like regular people.  Its really just hipster dialogue with this AMAZIING IDEA of how about we draw horns, or whatever, on each person and present it as fantasy. Each species acts like all the others and so do all the people.  Every species is presented as being attraced to any and all other species even if it is anatomically impossible for them to have sex.  Hello spider lady, just saying.  I like weird and I generally like this author but some logic is necessary for me.<br /><br />I give it three stars only because it is not truly awful. It is just not nearly as good as it could have been.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|additive game. highly recommended for all takers.  you can easily pass many hours being entertained by this game. The User is required to earn coins to upgrade vehicles.
0316247545|5.0|This book can response all your questions of the popular tv show My Little Pony Friendship is Magic.Lovely edition,for all ages.
B007WTFWJ6|5.0|Although many refactorings are supplied with modern IDE's, It was very helpful to understand how to realize them manually if needed and, of course, to get to know that such refactoring exists and why does it exist. No matter how complicated my task is and how complicated code will be, I'm absolutely confident that I will be able to break complicated code down to small and easy-to-understand pieces.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love to read this KIng James version, because it is very close to Greek Bible translation, it provides original translations. It teaches, it edifies, it corrects and provides councel. Other versions are good but this one is better, because it scriptures are much more orderly. I here by recommend all Bible readers not to miss this version.
B001GSTOAM|5.0|This book changed completely my approach in writing code, no difference if it's Java, C# or Visual Basic. I think after reading it I'm in a new level of programming.
B007FIY3VW|5.0|It is a product that is very wonderful as I have put it in the headline, it is a product that has helped many people all over the world in computer office and graphic work, its working efficiency is super, I have used this product for less than one month, but when I compare this product to other products that I have been using previously, this product is far better. Because of its being superior and more efficient than other products of the same version, I recommend that many people all over the world purchase it.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Great action movie with loads of humor. We enjoyed it and can not wait for more. Do not hurry away during the end credits because the surprise is there.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Okay,I just downloaded this because the idea of a subway version of Temple Run seemed awesome!!!!!You definitely need the Paris one so update every time a new one comes out.Very reasonable.It is not just another game in the garbage-Better than that (like,really).Not trying to act mature,this game is awesome!
B00C5ZORES|5.0|As someone who just discovered this band, I have to say - I am very happy with my purchase. I heard the second song somewhere as a great workout song - \\"My Songs Know What You Did In The Dark\\". And it holds up. I checked out all the other samples and the album was DEFINITELY the way to go. Love it. Five Stars!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I would have liked to hear more of the NDE experience and less of the neurosurgeon's medical jargon ... the personal reflections and life story were nice addition .
1623420148|5.0|Your must read this book, because you're gonna have fun, laugh, I was very entertained.<br /><br />Drew is cocky, full of himself, egotistical, handsome, a success men but he's a manhore.<br />He meet Kate at work a girl he saw in a bar last weekend and refuse his advance... and she has a fiance.<br />At work they argued, they bickered, they flirted, and it was great to read. the verbal foreplay was so funny...compete each other to obtain the account..laugh so hard when the game \\"who arrives first at the office\\"..<br />But all foreplay made both to fall in love, with Kate love her character and Drew believes it was the flu...but then finally to understand he fall in love and win Kate heart again... with a lot of demonstration of his love...<br /><br />I love this book 5 stars
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|I really loved watching this movie. I loved the shocking experience of going from the outside of the house to the inside.  Whoever came up with that idea is as brilliant as the one who came up with the shocking ending with the battle scene in Breaking Dawn pt. 2.  It was a very nice surprise to see Viola Davis in the movie somehow I missed that fact along the way.  Her role in the story was also a very wonderful discovery in the story line.  This movie is definitely on my hit list and will be a much watched addition to my collection.  If you are a fan of the Twilight Saga, Vampire Diaries, True Blood, Secret Circle you will more than likely become a BC fan as I have.  A real must see!
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|If you like Quentin Terrintino movies then this will not disappoint. It is long, and you have to have patience but a fun movie.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Very interesting movie.  GREAT CAST.  Family friendly and provocative.  The kids enjoyed it as well.  Would recommend it to others.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|You have to love this series and the Victorian snarky dialogue and gushing English drama. There's something for everyone, twists, trysts, downright mean and ugly tactics,..it is a highbrow, English version of 'Dallas' if I may be so bold to compare.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show. I tried to only watch one episode daily but I found myself watching two or three episodes a day. There were parts of the show that you could never predict would be the outcome. This show definitely deserves an award for the cast and writing. I can't wait until season 4 starts.
B00D2K40WY|1.0|You open it to find out all you've gotten for your trouble is the opening page.  You have to pay for the rest of the program.  That's really cheap.
0670026603|5.0|I bought this book based on the reviews I read in several magazines and on Amazon. I was worried the subject matter would be too depressing. This is one of the best books I have read. What a delight! I sobbed, I laughed out loud. Jojo Moyes you are brilliant!!<br />This book has stayed in my heart for many days now.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Its a lot better than I thought it was. Twists turns and a lot of likable characters, which is hard to find these days...
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sylvia Day is an amazing writer! She captured me with the first book I read! This book is on my list of top favortie books. Different from Fifty Shades, the captures you!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|*SPOILER*<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />I don't like 2 characters dieing in one season! Otherwise, enjoyed this season as much as the others.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book was amazing!!! Absolutely loved the whole series, cannot wait for the next book to come out!!! Must Read!
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is a very fun game in which you can build or craft almost anything. But no matter how fun it is apple gets updates at least a week in advance. Very fun but updates are still coming.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|No clue yet since my printer at home won't talk to droid devices. Intend to buy a new printer soon.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|it is by far the best game ive ever played and I think every one should get it like I did
B00009RGBS|5.0|Looking for this movie forever!!! I wanted this for our granddaughter who is in dance.  She performs all over so when she got it she was so excited!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|As a person who had never seen or read one of the Hannibal stories this was a great way to start. I am now enthralled with the character Hannibal and can't wait for more. The acting is phenomenal and I can't get enough of the cinematography. So if you're wondering whether or not so watch this series just watch the first episode you won't be disappointed.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Good. Story and execution. Well deserved success. Leaves just the right amount in the dark.  Don't expect the movie here!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is awesome and addictive. I love the characters and enjoy seeing where they are heading in life. It is refreshing to see that not everyone gets a happy ending all the time.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It's fun. But it's something that I'll play if I'm really bored. Most of it makes since, but occasionally I find myself just randomly pressing the screen to see if anything happens.
B009O07NBQ|4.0|we thought the soundtrack would have ALL the songs from the movie.  My younger daughters favorite song is the dwarf song and it is not the same as it was in the movie.  She was disappointed.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is really a good game. It will definitely get your brain working. Can't wait for the next level
B009Y4E414|5.0|I am late to the party but have finally discovered the gift of Eva Cassidy. She has a strikingly beautiful soulful voice that speaks to me like none other.
B00008G7UF|5.0|I'm not one who normally likes romantic stories. But with this one it's alright. Meg Ryan makes you feel comfortable, and Kevin Kline is so convincing as the french man. This is my favorite film. .
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I had a hard time out to g it down. I look forward to the rest of the series.
B00COHAUD4|1.0|I wasn't able to download the movie I never got to see it but still got charged!!! I am not happy with amazon at all! I would give no stars but unfortunatelyyou can't do that
B00499QUK2|4.0|Casting is excellent, the updating of the characters into present day is well done. Good scripts. Puts the US series with Lucy Liu to shame. For that matter, best re telling of the characters since the old 40's movies with Basil Rathbone & Nigel Bruce.
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|Game is fun as he'll but it sign u out to fast so it's complicated also not enough people amazon should put this game on commercial real talk.
1594136238|4.0|I didn't expect to like this book much.  It was chosen by my book club. I found it interesting and Liked the character development.  Some unsympathetic characters, but the author still made them people the reader is interested in.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|Overall the various gsmes are good or great, except the new Mighty Red Feathers. it is just like the Bad Piggies game and very different. It stinks and most Angry Birds players will hate it.t
B000Q79HS8|2.0|If I had known director of # 2 & 3 was going to do a voiceover I would not have purchased this product.  Couldn't hear actors.
B001EBWING|5.0|This is on my short list of greatest movies of all time - and it's wonderful to be able to watch it any time I want. Thanks.
B00BT0ZDF2|5.0|I have watched this film 4 times and find myself in further awe with each viewing.  I sincerely believe it to be the most remarkable movie ever made.
B004JHYRAE|5.0|If you are seeking a non-monogamous lifestyle, if you're in a relationship and want to explore options or boundaries, or if you simply wish to seek understanding of how others approach their relationship choices, this is a great book.  It is written in a very personal, conversational manner.  Highly recommended.
B003MS7V8G|4.0|If you like cooking shows, San Francisco, and Brazilian music then this is the movie to watch.  Penelope Cruz is always a pleasure to watch on the screen.
B00499NHLC|5.0|This show is very clever and has outstanding performances that bring to life the brilliant witty dialog of the writer.
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|Just came back from my first trip to Australia when I learned about this book. I learned a lot for it, I laughed a lot reading it. I give Australia 5stars and this book 5stars, do both and get 10 stars.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Good read. More social commentary than horror. (But those parts are pretty good too) Movie previews don't seem to jibe.
0062255657|5.0|The Ocean at the End of the Lane is a slim volume, but it packs so much within it's pages!  Neil Gaiman weaves a magical story, delicate as memory with so many layers and unspoken emotions beneath its words, that it is a book that will continue to reveal new things on every reread.  While reading this book, I found the atmosphere created to be totally enthralling and rich, even with the deceptively simple prose style that I've come to associate with Neil's work.  The way he wields words is wondrous to me, because the words in themselves are ordinary, but somehow when he puts them together they become so much more.  I always feel like there is a need to savor his stories because of the unique way in which he tells them, and this book is probably the most richly multi-faceted one of his that I have read.<br /><br />The story begins with the awakening of memory and layers a story of a potentially normal childhood with one of fantasy disguised as myth, moving from the mundane - made somehow especially so when seen through the sincere and candid eyes of a young boy - to things that are timeless and both dangerous and comforting at turns.  I think it is difficult to tell you what this story is truly about, mostly because it has so much depth that it can have many different meanings.  I found the story entrancing and magical and completely beautiful in a touching and melancholic way.  There is also the need once you have finished it to immediately reread it, because there are things that are said in the beginning that are given new meaning by the end and it changes the story significantly.<br /><br />This is a lovely book from a master storyteller, with a glorious mixture of mystery and emotion and magic.  If you are a fan of Neil Gaiman, don't miss this book!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|so far it is a good game but just started...wished could get more pearls without spending real money but o well I guess
B009LRE040|1.0|The first two were great but this one sucks. Ann Hathaway sinks the movie. Her acting and character suck and she is vaguely ugly and annoying to watch. The tempo of the movie is very slow and boring, the action mostly non engaging. Bane the bad guy is the best part until he becomes a cliche bad guy. The whole movie is very predictable. A big downgrade from the first two. Why so much effort to destroy gotham? Just give one guy a suitcase nuke or a bio weapon and be done with it. Instead endless complex plans to destroy a stupid city full of stupid people. If you want to know how the trilogy ends without squirming through this crappy movie: Batman(Bale) retires to Europe and screws a french chick and has babies. That is his reward for all the crazy stuff he has gone through for Gotham.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Love that it made you use your brain and needs more floors to play.I would tell more poeple to play this game because that's how much fun that had playing this game.
B0053TWV46|5.0|We have Always loved this movie and the first one, so I was very happy that we found it here and for a wonderful price!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like brain tester because its fun to get poeple to use there brains and find smart you really think you relly are not so if you want to challage a onther person to have gun there brain then this is the game for that.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Thanks to this app I can download music and podcasts on my phone which is a great feature. Highly reccomended
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app. I play it all most everyday! but I wish it was more like the computer version.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|It's become a soap opera. The writing didn't seem as good as the first two years. They seemed to go for shocking events and lost the intricacies of relationships between characters found in the first two seasons.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I was one of those people who watched the first episode when it aired, was completely lost, and didn't follow the show after that.  Despite friends rave reviews.  I have to admit, now that time has passed and I'm able to binge on many episodes at once, the clues dropped in one episode and picked up several later ... are exciting.  Still confusing, but exciting!  I'll be glad to catch up on the rest of this show now that I have the chance.
B004RL9T50|4.0|Pixar always wins with me but Dreamworks can be hit or miss.  Loved Kung Fu Panda and How To Train Your Dragon.<br /><br />I rented this on a whim and REALLY enjoyed it!  I like Will Ferrel's schtick so that helps but this was a nice animated movie.  Recommended!!
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|I downloaded this game for my daughter and she loves it. she plays it a lot, and loves showing us her creations.
B0055JPM6I|5.0|Love this movie!!!  It was a great movie that was hilarious from the beginning.  So many funny parts and there is a lot to keep you interested throughout.  Great cast.  A lot of humor.  I love this movie!
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|While its not Three Weddings and a Funeral, Dustin put together a great cast of people, taking a realistic situation, and it finds the funny bone in bits and pieces. The pace could be a little better and the plot is easy to spot, but watching these actors give their spin on the characters is worth the watch.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|I like it but it has its tricks if you go to fast press the brake it will stop you from cracking your neck
B003OUXECE|4.0|If you have played Bioshock or Bioshock 2 and enjoyed them, you will enjoy learning the back story to the game.
B005544V6A|5.0|Witty, funny, ...love the characters.  Always interesting, interwoven plots, enjoy the references to old movies, and love the rapid fire pace of the show.  Never a dull moment.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|With all I heard about this book before I bought it I was truly a little concerned about its content.  All I have to say is that it has spiced up my marriage like whoa!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Seems great so far.  Each level was challenging enough without being frustrating.  I liked the memory work involved with solving some of the puzzles.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Great show! I haven't been into a show on tv like this since the first season of Spartacus. Not a huge use of cheesey special effects like other shows I've seen. Can't wait for season 2 to start!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I've never played a game like this and there are NO instructions!!  It's confusing in a good sort of way - and once I found a \\"cheater\\" blog that walked me through the first level, it was easier to understand ... but it really needs a help bar or a few clues for the clueless...like me!
B009R5GR1K|5.0|This IS the go to app for any word related information. It even has a few games, event of the day, etc.  This app will be useful for a long, long time.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|This bottle cutter was just what I needed to start upcycling my used bottles into works of art, thanks Amazon for putting me on the \\"CUTTING EDGE \\" of the Generation Green Scene ;)
B00AR83PN4|1.0|This game would be ok if the controls were better, and the graphics were easier on the eyes. Trying to place the blocks is very frustrating because if you're trying to move them towards you, they might slam down to the board, you just don't know which is going to happen. sometimes they just won't move where you want them no matter what. Another bad thing is the Colors. Way too bright and cheap looking. Also there are apparently two shades of yellow, or maybe one is supposed to be orange, I don't know. But there shouldn't be two colors that close to each other.<br /><br />Bottom line, this game has too many issues to be fun to play. More aggravation than anything else. Cubistry is another game by the same company that I do like, so I was surprised this one was so much worse.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I lost the cable included with the purchase of my Kindle,  This appears to be an exact replacement and it works fine.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|loved this book. couldn't put it down. loved the ending. would recommed to anyone who loves Stephen King. will buy the movie also.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have recommended this keyboard to all my android user friends and they all love it.  They onlyliked using a physical keyboard but they said this keyboard is so much better.<br /><br />There came to a point where the keyboard could predict whole sentences. They did a great job!
1781162646|5.0|was a little dissapointed in this because it wasn't as intense as most Stephen King books, but it was a good and easy read. I was so into the storyline that I just couldn't put it down. Great addition to my library
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|This movie was complete garbage.  There is no other way to describe it.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.<br /><br />I'm normally a fan of Tom Hanks, but he signed onto a terd of a movie here.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|This fun game allows you to be creative and design your own restaurant. There are goals for you to complete along the way which helps you to gain more money and experience. Good game.
B005IDXIL2|4.0|I don't play it as often as I did when I first got it but it is fun.  Easy to get strikes not so easy to get the spares(just like real bowling). I still enjoy the challenge and would recommend it.
B00005MP58|4.0|I purchased this DVD set because I have an addiction to P&P. I've seen both the new version of the movie with Kiera Knightly and the older BBC version.  This version of the movie is right in the middle: it follows the book well enough to not drive me crazy but not word-for-word like the older version.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|From the writer of the best book ever &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34; Fantastic! Cant wait for the third of this trilogy. His research is phenomonal.
B001CDLATE|4.0|This disc contains great photography.  I am sure that most people would be very happy with purchasing the disc Baraka.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|This game was fun it's very addicting like candy crush saga.  Once you get the hang of it.lots of fun
B00AR83PN4|1.0|I don't like this game.  At all.  The font is very difficult to read.  The colors are too bright and gaudy.  And the control features do not work more than half of the time, causing the cubes to fall wherever instead of where I am trying to make them fall.  This was the free app of the day and I played less than 5 minutes before I was frustrated.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|This book has so many elements to it that to try and describe it in a few sentences wouldn't do it justice. I found that it had me questioning my ethics and beliefs but also trying to understand each side of the story. It was perhaps especially poignant for me as a similar scenario was playing out in court with a public figure at the time of reading the novel. Once again, Jodi Picoult doesn't disappoint with her literary content and insight.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved it with qll my heart it was really fun and awesome i would recommend buying it for you or a kid
B003M70O5O|4.0|Once I started watching I had to continue. I am sorry the show did not continue on but I suppose that is why it lasted five seasons.
B005OZE9SA|4.0|We have several iMac's running ProTools with Saffire 56's, and we also have several PC's for voice work of which we use the Art Tube MP as the USB interface.  Personally I like the features of the Art and we only record one channel.  So why buy, because we needed another set of plugin for another iMac.  That being said, and using the tool as we do compared with others, I can say it performs well, however, on all out USB units we use Grace M101 preamps so I cannot comment on the preamp part of this unit.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  I want to meet the director and writer.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This book was spellbinding.  Very sad, but so powerful.  Keep me guessing what was going to happen next.  The end was interesting - can see her having a relationship with Sarah's son.  Highly recommend it.
B008220D7S|1.0|Boring.<br /><br />This review was created, written, directed, produced and edited by me. Oh, it has starred my wife and my children.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Great graphic, challenging and fun to play. As many if these games go, if you really want to improve your equipment/suits you have to buy points. They have to make money.... Definitely a game worth having.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|This visit to Oz explains everything about the earlier classic. If you want to know the back-story to the Wizard of Oz, watch this movie.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|This does a great job of protecting the Kindle Fire.  It is quite handy in the kitchen when you need an extra hand.
B008ASGP3U|4.0|As an old dinosaur operating in the new order of policing in Edinburgh. He's still as funny and irreverent as ever, but he's a tough old dog who knows his way around and he finds the &#34;old ways&#34; still yields results. He has a new nemesis in the form of Malcolm Fox, who's in the Complaints (next on my to read list), who wants to see relics like him done with and finally and truly retired. So that's how Rebus is in this new book, though he's still got his allies like Siobhan Clark, now DI, and even in an old foe like Gerald Cafferty. There are a lot of new characters introduced here too, especially the one that carries on Cafferty's torch, so it will be interesting to see how they evolve in the coming titles.<br /><br />Story-wise, still a good read, though it lags in spots, but not too much. I found the wrapping up of the ending a little unbelievable, but there's usually a thread picked up into the next book, so we'll see how it goes from there. All in all, happy to see Ian Rankin revive and revitalize ol' Rebus, hope he does pass his physical and get's back into the force, and may it be with him.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I have all three of Om Nom's adventures. Fun and interesting levels as always! I love the time travel aspect.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|This is a great movie and the best out of the three in Nolan's Trilogy in my opinion. The joker is done in a way that has never been seen before and he sets the bar very high throughout the movie.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|Now What ? !<br /><br />It's been several years since the Purps came out with an album, allegedly eight, but I don't think that's correct.<br /><br />Still though, after a long drought, they're back and this time they have something to say.<br /><br />Not so much in the lyrics, the Purps have generally stayed away from politics and social issues, but this time it revolves around the presentation and atmosphere that this album brings to the fore.<br /><br />Produced by Bob Ezrin, of middle period Pink Floyd fame/infamy and released after the death of founding member Jon Lord, along with the induction of the 2013 Rock and Roll Hall of Shame and Infamy nominee's; the album title (along with the attitude displayed both in the group photo and songs on the CD) says it all...<br /><br />Now What ? !<br /><br />Now what do we have to do? We lost our founding father, literally, since Jon was the oldest in the group and another year of being shut out from the R&R Hall of Shame (though, at this point, I think the Purps, honestly, no longer care). The opportunity for one Huge, El Biggo, reunion forever gone...Now What, is their query.<br /><br />There were, and still are, a lot of late 60's and early 70's Supergroups that equalled and or surpassed Deep Purple in fame and popularity; but the Purps were first and foremost, musicians. Some, like Jon Lord, proved themselves to be of Julliard School qaulity musicians and despite all their ups and downs, ins and outs over the past 40 years (45, minus their five year break-up), they've always produced great music. And while Deep Purple will always be known as a Hard Rock band, their fans realize that their musical depth and breadth over the years belies any real labelling.<br /><br />While there is a certain air of sadness and resignation to this CD; this may be their last CD as they are getting older (though, since only a few members were ever really druggies, they are in very good health and show it); the Purps go on to answer theirown question by doing what they've always done...play music.<br /><br />The Purps kick off the album with A Simple Song, which starts out slow but then kicks into gear. Other standouts include Hell to Pay, Bodyline, Uncommon Man, Apres' Vous and Vincent Price.<br /><br />Much like Rapture of the Deep, the Purps allow Don Airey to come to the fore and show everyone that as much as they miss and love Jon Lord, the band made the best choice possible when finding his replacement. Several songs have orchestral accompaniament and Ian Paice displays a lot of his old speed and vigour on at least a few tunes; but, Ian Gillan proves once and for all that he's now the heart and soul of the band and delivers the goods.<br /><br />I would call the entire CD a mid-paced rocker, these guys know who they are and what they have done and don't have to prove anything to anyone else, except that they are still out there; alive and kicking.<br /><br />I completely enjoyed the entire album, not a bad song in the batch, but after a somewhat...sad, maybe even resigned...tone to the CD, the band shakes off the blues and really delivers the Goods with their homage to Vincent Price.<br /><br />I purchased the Deluxe Edition, which comes with a second DVD, complete with interview, alt version of \\"All the Time in the World\\" and two more live cuts.<br /><br />I'm not the biggest Mark 7/8 fan in the world, but I really enjoyed this album from start to finish and have played it three times in the past two days.<br /><br />If it's a final Swan Song for one of the best musical groups to ever set foot on stage...they went out with a bang and with class!<br /><br />Now What?<br /><br />Why, to keep on plugging away and showing everyone that they can still play and create great music.<br /><br />IMHO, this is one of the best Mark 7/8 DP albums ever produced!<br /><br />Deep Purple Review...Upgrade<br /><br />Okay, after numerous listenings now (almost ten) over the past few weeks...and I'm shocked tosay this, but...I think \\"Now What\\" easily slides into the top five EVER DP albums...without a doubt.<br /><br />YMMV, but it's a superb album, full of subtleties and even some chordal homage to the classic Mark II Deep Purple.<br /><br />I also think the Purps found their producer too!
B009LGO88E|5.0|I bought this for Resident Evil and Monster Hunter and I couldn't be more impressed with it. Great buy. I love it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I'm hooked...I enjoy it very much! How do I get it free?  I get started playing and can't get away from it...I go back and attempt to improve my scores on completed games..I think it is more fun to play this way than with people on the actual board game...maybe because you don't have to wait for others to play their hand!<br />Rita
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Everyone enjoyed this flick!  It had the kids glued to the screen with excitement and they couldn't wait for David banner to change into the green guy!
B0045IPOPE|5.0|Apocalypse Now is one the greatest movies ever. The movie is an epic in its storytelling and cinematography and captures the surreal nature of war.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|The Avengers is a fun movie.  I especially thought it was awesome that they took the characters (and main cast) from other movies and pulled them together.  That's quite a feat in itself.<br /><br />There are a few references to the separate movies, but it's not like you have to watch those movies to get this one.  The movie has enough action to keep it going.  Each superhero gets sufficient camera time both separately and as part of the Avengers team.  Overall, the movie was well done.
B002M2T1UO|1.0|Although we are really enjoying this series, the disks arrived &#34;new&#34; but scratched and damaged to the point that we miss a portion of every show. We returned them twice with little success and no follow up from Amazon despite multiple phone calls with customer service. There is clearly a bad production batch out there. Not their fault, but suggest you purchase these hand screened or even used from a reliable source as New is not worth it.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Loved it, just wish it wasn't so long between seasons, but thats not your fault!  Waiting for Season three to be released  :)
B006AX6ONI|3.0|This is a compilation of blog posts, very interesting posts with a lot of useful advice in them for sure, but if you don’t know a little bit about the author before reading this you probably won’t understand many things he say because he refers to many of his companies and ventures, many of which I didn’t know about and had no ideas what they do/did, if they failed or succeeded, etc.
B0094KT6J8|5.0|Our girls are such huge fans of this movie that they scraped together their own money to pay for this movie.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|its fine but some levels are very hard to beat sometimes you just want to give up its that type of puzzle game.
B008602KQI|5.0|Loved this movie!
B00CKQ1092|5.0|Enough said. Amazing album. They seem to be pushing the bar higher and evolving. Maybe it hit me at the right time, but better than Miss Machine...
B008602KQI|3.0|my understanding is this is supposed to be a story for the tween set... i am not sure that i find it appropriate for that age group but that is a parental call... perhaps i would have found the movie more compelling if i had not read the book first ... having said that if i hadnt read the book i probably wouldnt have watched the movie... it isnt so much that the story is weak as much as it is the book is far stronger which is often the case ...  the acting was satisfactory and the filming was adequate... i know this is a lack luster review but again the grain of salt is that i read the book first... additionally ... i have a cultural bias against films that portray children as the smartest people in the room ...which is done far more in the movie than in the book... as a stand alone its worth seeing but not at full price ... if you read the book i would give it a miss there can only be disappointment there
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game is an excellent game for those who like strategy and enjoy a more advanced game than Sorry. After my wife and I were taught how to play, we became addicted. The board is pretty cool and includes some neat pieces and the board is separate pieces which enable the game to be a new experience each time! Overall, I highly recommend this to a couple or group who enjoy a challenging game. Though I will caution that the game was very difficult to teach to younger and not as advanced thinkers. I should add that for the most part anyone, with patience can understand the game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My 3 children Love this game.  Since I put this on my kindle for my youngest son (that is 7) to play, my older kids (11 &9) keep playing it as well.  I have not played this game personally but my kids love it.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Kept me on edge through out the whole book. I couldn't put it down!  I am going to recommend to all my friends!
B005GQ5HB0|4.0|A good read. But disturbing in many places: makes you think about the awfull times that ordinary people had to endure. Then the aftermat of the war on ordinary people too and how it changed them all for ever . At the same time ,how a yougher generation could not come to terms with the history.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I only recently discovered this program thanks to Amazon. From the first episode I was hooked.  At a time when television programming leaves much to be desired, it's terrific to find something that is intelligent, thought provoking and completely entertaining.  I've been faithfully watching Seasons 1 through 4. I'm nearing the end of Season 3, and each time an episode comes to an end, can't wait for the next one!  Love this program and look forward to Season 5!!!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I got this so that when we plan things I can look and see what the weather is going to be and watch the storms on here it is a helpful tool
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Really fun and addictive. Played through twice already and got two other family members addicted as well! Can't wait for part two!
B007QDNKQA|4.0|Makes you wonder if simarlar things involving the government have happened in real life.  Typical Hollywood production where impossible things happen though
B008XG1X18|5.0|I got this app on my kindle fire. If I don't have good internet connection then it takes forever to load, but its the best app ever.
B002BBJ52U|2.0|it appeals, I guess, to a younger generation!  I found the movie to be quite trite. I would suggest a younger audience..20 and younger!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft pocket edition is a great game on the go. Whenever I go somewhere and can't get to my xbox I can just pull out my kindle and play it;D
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Amazing graphics superb story telling, great war shooting game.<br />The game takes into a story n helps you live it.<br />The shooting, aiming, weapons etc are on point.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I could have liked this a lot more based on its subject matter and scientific stance.  However, the writing style was immature and a little annoying...........surprising for an md of this guy's stature.  But then, maybe he had a ghost writer who was determined to dumb the book down.  Read it...........good food for thought.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I thank the game is birding after a while but fun when you get more stuff thanks for listening everyone
B00CWV8X04|4.0|Some of Soderberg's movies are fantastic (Sex, Lies and Videotape). This one is good, not great. Based on the previews the character I thought was the bad person wasn't, so that was a nice surprise. On the other hand, that character wasn't particularly likeable either.
B008JFUP0I|5.0|I enjoyed the movie a lot best out of the series imo. Great action, great stunts and looked very good
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I really LOVE science, and science is lamentably light in modern diet and health writing.  Way too much emotion, wishful thinking, and relying on proven failures.  We know the food pyramid is just wrong - we know because we've been eating it for all of my lifetime and we're fat and sick and unhealthy.<br /><br />So let's try something new.  Let's look at how the body works, and how what we put in our mouths impacts how we function, and then let's make changes that actually make a difference!<br /><br />No preaching here.  No emotional appeals substituting for thought.  Just research and science and history.
B0001EKZOQ|3.0|I'll have to listen to this CD a few more times to make up my mind about it.  I was not familiar with this kind of music but it deserves a further review.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|love it<br /><br />entertaining, fun, appropriate for children of all ages.<br /><br />quality was perfect<br /><br />great way to prepare to see the 2nd movie!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The book has an exquisite arc of emotions for Hazel and I was pulled fully into the story.  You don't need to be a teen to enjoy this beautifully expressed account of Hazel's and her friends' struggles with cancer.  The story stayed with me long after I put it down.  I fully expect to see &#34;soon to be a major motion picture&#34; on future covers.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|The book is interesting and fun to read.  I am amazed at how much I did not know about Steve Jobs.  His eccentricity lead to many successes, some planned, some accidental.
0307887960|5.0|I like this Dukan concept but as with all diets, one has to apply it to their daily life.  I have decided that I am going to consciously try to follow these principles.  My doctor told me that if I follow the guidlines in this book that he guarantee I will lose a substantial amount in 30 days.  He did give me a number of pounds but I do not want the number to detract from what I am saying about this book. Also, he is the one who first told me about this diet.  I am half way through the book (because I put it down for weeks) and am going to try this diet when I finish reading it in its entirety.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Evernote on my Mac, in the cloud and now on my Kindle. To be able to pour notes, web pages, URLs and more into one place and easily is a huge benefit.
B0015HOFZI|3.0|The software that comes with a new unit was not there, and it appears that a preamp must be purchased and additional cables. More money out before I know if it works or not. Downloaded a trial of software so will still have to purchase that.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is great it allows you to take care of a horse in all sorts of ways its like a really horse other apps only give you one or two ways to interact with your horse
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|A new and exciting series for a great change of pace. I really enjoyed the pilot and the next 2 episodes (I am just now getting started on the series). I would highly recommend it!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It is a fun game. It is not too hard or frustrating. The game makes u think just enough. Annoying that you are forced to rate the game to keep playing it tho.
B00CTERB2A|5.0|I hadn't heard of this series, so was delighted by how fun it is. A very quirky set up, lots of fun characters with twists - I'm looking forward to seeing more of the hidden plot revealed. Just enough grit to entertain adults, but very suitable for a younger audience.
B009VB998I|5.0|Kids loved this one and it was nice to watch with them.  Can not wait for the next tinkerbell movies to come out.
1451696191|5.0|The most perfect book of them all. I wanted to buy the book before seeing the moving but unfortunately that didn't happen, so i ended up seeing the movie before. It's great, but good God, the book is now one of my favorite.
B00DAXXO98|4.0|Not bad. The trouble is the original series was more fun. The british think politics is funny. Americans take it more seriously. They think politicians should be role models. ( which is  alarming ).  The villian in the british series could enjoy his evil. The american one has to sort of not obviously be enjoying it. Which is a bore. But Spacey is lovely. What if he could con an english accent and play Francis Urquart?
B008BU75IQ|4.0|Just when you thought it was over.......<br /><br />Continuing exploits of poor boy (Clifton) and rich girl (Barrington) and their progeny (Sebastian).<br />However, the book moves right along, imparts info on British government & politics, school system climb<br />and early issue of women's work movement plus added mystery of a cast of extras.  All the while keeping<br />one wanting to finish the book at rapid speed then BAM!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Thought this would be hard to follow because of multiple plot lines and fantasy geography.  Not so!  Very well written..geography still a little confusing but overall highly recommended.
B002SHD9E2|4.0|This is what my wife said. I have not seem the stage version but I did very much enjoy this film and could see how trying to replicate it with the same level of detail (the water effects in the Phantom's lair, etc.) on stage might be difficult.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this whole series!! The characters are easy to love and hate, the twists and turns are exciting, and unlike a lot of TV series today - it isn't borderline pornographic! I started watching the 1st season online and watched all 4 within a month! Can't wait for the new season.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Although the Hunger Games is written for the younger set, I found it to be a page-turner.  This writer knows how to keep constant interest in the story.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|This move is in my top ten favorites. Robert Downey Jr is too clever for his own good which makes fore a humorous and exciting movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely love the hunger games series. They just get better every time I read them. I wish Suzane Collins didnt end the seiries... i wish they could be with me forever.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|The Lord of the Ring movies are in my top ten favorite movies but The Hobbit was just a little bit too hokey for me. The light heartedness was kind of a nice change from the other movies but it just wasn't the same. Too much comic relief when it wasn't needed.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|H8ed it. I looked everywhere for words and I CANT FIND WAT I WANTED. So much for having important words
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game recommend it, fun puzzles, spend a lot of time finding clues,<br />Must get game, spend hours , YouTube great help if stuck
B000PDYVVG|5.0|This book is the push I've needed to make changes in my life.  With colloquial, approachable language, the book opens up nicely to a character with many struggles who is desperately trying to rid those struggles of her life, mind, body, and soul.  It is inspiring.
B00CATSONE|4.0|This is a very informative book and I think that Tesla has not been given the prominence which he desrves. Herman Rothenberg
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Poopy! I really enjoyed this game, besides the fact that it's stopped at level ten. I recommend this game! Can't wait for more like it!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Slow at first- but keeps you on your toes as the level  get harder and harder!! I found myself screaming at the screen lol
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game it was one of the many games that I was waiting to be on kindle rather than just apple products. Finally here and I am very satisfied.
1455807354|5.0|This was a great Reacher book. It was interesting the whole way through. Typical action for Reacher and I love the reader's voice (as always)..
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Dragonvale is such an awesome game! It is so addicting too:) and the best part is you get to breed dragons and get special dragons without paying for them! :)
B006N0YWGY|5.0|I'm into driving/racer games, and this is the best racer game I've found yet on Kindle Fire. I like the tap/steer/accelerate controls more than tablet tilt controls. Once you develop the right touch your boating skills will improve. Love the novel approach to scoring based on buy low / sell high. Nothing like a little Wall Street education while sending cops and gators flying through the air! 5 stars, I got it free but I'd have paid for it. Will buy other games by this crew.
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|i love this product because i like going to luminosity and it is similar to to it. I it a wonderful to keep the mind active and happy!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This is a really great show. Personally I think White Collar is better overall though. I wish there were more shows similar to those.
B00C1N9JWO|4.0|I love this series and have been enjoying all of her books for a long time.  This book, though not her absolute best ,was good.  I think because of who the male lead was in the book, (for any reader who has not following the series the male lead was historically a bad guy) it was somewhat difficult to warm up to him.  But in the end, I did love the way he protected the femaie lead.  Overall, I give it 4 stars and am looking forward to her next Psy/Changling novel.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|first in the series that hooks your interest and builds some strong characters and a great storyline and makes you want to read the whole series.
B006INDS0W|4.0|This was a fascinating &#34;what would you do?&#34; film.  Also a creepy biopic that examines the  powers of persuasion of a sociopath and his ability to blend in with normal society, even though being capable of doing horrendous things.  The movie is a little confusing at the beginning as it flips back and forth between time periods, yet this confusion seems intentional.  It is extremely clever in its use of setting to show time changes, and thrives on flashback.  Normally flashbacks are frowned upon, yet this story is built upon the idea that a person who has been through traumatic experiences and has done things that are morally controversial may spend a great deal of their lives flashing back to the past, especially when that past comes back to haunt them. Excellent and unsettling film. A truly horrible villain, all the more so because he really existed.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|I don't like this game because you have to &#34;purchase&#34; time to play or wait for a time limit to play again.  I deleted the app from my Kindle.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|First off, the app is garnered to young kids... with dubious intentions. The developers were not very talented in the game play aspect, however they make up for it in their dubious in game tactics. Clearly they must base they business model over some Nigerian crime ring.<br /><br />The vendor makes it easy to purchase add-ons & for any child under 5, they will keep buying add-ons unscrupulously.<br /><br />In my case my 4 yr Son used the kindle, it turns out its easy to by additional add-ons. $5 upgrades galore with no daily limit. Avoid, unless you like to get charged $40 a day. Never had a problem with unauthorized purchases till now, been a kindle user for years.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love all of the different options.  You don't get tired of one particular game because you can change it up and go to a different game.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book was very interesting about Dr Alexander's experience when he was near death.  A very easy & fastenating reading book.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The story is well written and I love the main characters, Gideon and Eva!  I read book #3 as soon as it came out and will go crazy until the next one is released!!!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This game is fun and exasperating.  I keep trying to get the stars off the board and can't quite make it on one game.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I love how quick I can access my mail, and how quick I can delete unwanted mail just by picking up my Kindle.
B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|Moneyball is about Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane's attempts to compete with MLB's teams who have higher payrolls. Moneyball is not a pure baseball film; it really is a business film that blends in aspects of baseball. And, I think it is less about the \\"underdog\\" taking on the big boys as it is coming up with a system of team's competing year in and year out with less money at their disposal. The divide between MLB's big market teams and small market teams has been an issue for years now, and so small market teams have had to be creative coming up with ways to compete. Without much money for \\"big name\\" stars, the Oakland A's have used a system, \\"moneyball,\\" to get undervalued players that will produce. The basic idea of moneyball is to use statistical analysis to understand the \\"value\\" of a player and use this as a means of getting high quality, underrated players. As technical and impersonal as this idea sounds, somehow the film handles it the right way.<br /><br />To me, the film misses the mark by straying away from the \\"moneyball\\" premise sometimes. For one, they add in this whole subplot about Beane's relationship with his daughter, which is sort of distracting. Also, I think sometimes they don't go as deep into the moneyball concept as they could, and it becomes more of a focus on Beane being at odds with several Oakland A's scouts and Art Howe, the manager.<br /><br />The casting was mostly good. I thought Brad Pitt did a pretty stellar job as the Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane; he seems to have his mannerisms down to a tee. (Although he is always eating; maybe being a general manager makes you very hungry). Jonah Hill does an excellent job as Peter Brand, who is the brains behind this entire moneyball system. Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who has the look of Oakland A's manager Art Howe, isn't given much to work with from the script other than arguing with Beane most of the film or grimacing in pain (at Beane's ideas).<br /><br />Although the film takes some liberties in exaggerating real-life events, I thought it was a pretty solid film.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I have fun playing with my grandchildren. Its a good learning tool and we all like to play the game.
B004LV2868|5.0|Anyone who thought that a-ha was an 80s one-hit wonder should give this amazing CD a listen. Morten's Harket's voice is almost flawless, and the musical performances are superb. This is a great example of a-ha's large and diverse repertoire. I absolutely love it. This is a MUST HAVE for any true a-ha fan. My only regret is that this was their farewell concert.
B0058O84G0|4.0|History lesson and entertainment in one book. Love the characters and different point of views. Wiil buy the next book.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Love love love! Had awesome stuff and very user friendly! Couldn't recommend more! Great filters and editing tools that can be used for any and all pictures
0785156593|3.0|When i looked for infinity gauntlet, i guess i was buying something that was more famous than it was good. I'm not saying it's bad because it isn't. It's just that i felt it too repetitive. The end wasn't one of my favorite ones either but i guess a lot of people will find it more atractive that i did.
1878424319|5.0|This book is a life changer! The four agreements are four very simple principles that are very difficult to master. As I have worked on applying the four agreements in my own life, I have found that my perceptions have shifted, my relationships have improved, and my life has changed. What a dramatic effect...all from applying four little principles. They may seem overly simple...after all, they are very basic and are just a matter of common sense...right? Apparently, common sense really isn't all that common these days! I know very few people who appear to have understanding of even one of these! While following just one or two agreements can make a big difference, working on all of them can be profound.<br />Do yourself a favor...read this book and give it an honest try! You'll be glad you did!
