B0017XOF5A|5.0|They really went back to basics with this one. It felt like Stargate from the first few seasons, a show in it's prime.  You can see they spent money on this one, the location shooting was amazing, the action never let up, and the story was interesting.  Now, all of us fans know this story is derivative of MANY previous Stargate episodes involving Time Travel, however, it's the execution that makes it stand out.  Ark of Truth was a good conclusion to the TV storyline, but this actually FEELS like a movie.     Also, watching Stargate in High Def is definitely worth the price.  If you're an SG1 fan, you'll love this movie. If you're not, you will still enjoy it.
031606792X|3.0|I loved the last three books and hope this book would tie up everything with a more powerful yet realistic message. This book was a disappointment. It was a real slap in the face for me. I'm somewhat glad to see I'm not the only one who thought so. I've actually read fanfiction which would have been a better ending to the series then Breaking Dawn did. Its truely a disappointment.
031606792X|1.0|It breaks my heart to see what this saga was reduced to in its final installment. I felt totally disconnected from the characters, as if I were reading some sort of AU fanfic written by an overly imaginative 13-year old that wanted to placate everyone with a happily ever after for all involved. A very disappointing effort from a writer I expected much more from. And while I still look forward to more of Stephanie Meyer's works in the future, I cannot in good conscious recommend this book to anyone that truly appreciates good YA literature.
031606792X|5.0|I usually don't jump on here for your reviews but I just finished the book and had to see what others were saying and I am SHOCKED at the negative press!  I think you all are somehow related to the Harry Potter backlash wanabe's and didn't even read the book.  Chill out, get a life and read it for what it is - fiction - fantasy.  If you are looking for good moral content for your teens, shut off the tv, movies and burn all books.  You can find hidden meanings, demonic code, religous agenda in anything you want - if you want to see it there!    Now for my review - I just discovered this series in June when looking for a good book to read and a teacher sitting next to me getting her nails done said it was so good she couldn't put it down.  As an adult reader, I whipped through all three books in three weeks and couldn't wait fot he fourth and final.  I am NOT dissappointed.  What a fun fantasy love story.  It has renewed my spirit to hold out for the \\"right one\\" who adores me and respects me no matter what the convential  thought.  You mothers of young girls - if you knew what was really going on with our 20 years olds - you would hug and hold this series as a virtuous example of who you want your girls to be.    Thanks SM - I have not read a book this good that has kept me up all night, literally.  Thank you thank you.  Adult Reader!
031606792X|1.0|Although the first \\"book\\" of Breaking Dawn was largely what I expected - an extension of the passionate love affair between Bella and Edward - the twist at the end of book one and the remaining storyline were contrived and disjointed. At various points, I was tempted to just put the book down and never pick it up again. The plot offers no payoff for fans interested in the myriad characters inhabiting the Twilight universe and completely ducks the sacrifices Bella should have had to make in order to become a vampire. With previous books, I raced through the first time and then re-read the book immediately. This time, however, I think I'll donate my copy to the local library. What a waste of time and money.
0143038419|2.0|I managed to work my way all the way through this drivel.  As others have mentioned, the author is self-absorbed, narcissistic, and has an overactive ego.  Why in the world would anyone care about this \\"story\\"?  Of what relevance is it to any of us?  None of the divorced people I know were able to gallavant around the world feeling sorry for themselves -- they were too busy busting their rear-ends trying to pay their lawyers, pay their bills and make sure their children were surviving the painful ordeal.  One thought to Elizabeth Gilbert.... get a REAL life!!    I gave it two stars (rather than one) because it IS well-written.  Ms. Gilbert clearly knows how to write and the book reads easily.  It's just the subject matter that drags down the rating...
031606792X|2.0|I would have liked it so much better if it wasn't a Twilight book. If it was a standalone book, not associated with the characters Steph created in the first 3.    SPOILERS!!!  +  +  +  +  +    I know change is inevitable, but COME ON. To me, Bella is barely recognizable. My stomach churns every time she says, \\"my daughter\\", \\"my baby\\", etc. Ugh. I mean, I want a happy ending for my favorite couple as much as anyone else, but this is ridiculous, nauseating, and I feel like it cheapens everything she built up in the first three. I mean, she took the time to detail exactly what Bella had to give up in order to be with Edward, and Bella came to terms with it. Now all of a sudden she doesn't have to sacrifice a damn thing. She had Edward, Charlie, Jacob, her baby, and now she's a strong and beautiful vampire.    I felt that Edward and Bella were written extremely out of character. The only parts I felt were actually in character were the scene where they sleep together for the first time after her change, and the very end where she allows him to read her mind. And, to some extent, the wedding.    I couldn't figure out what the deal was with Rosalie. First she was all crazy psycho baby stealer, then as soon as Bella became immortal it was like she said, \\"Oh, nevermind.\\"    I was extremely disappointed with the end, concerning the Volturi. I was expecting a battle of epic proportions and then Bella went all \\"Bubble shield: ON!\\" and again, it was like they decided, \\"Ok, nevermind. No battle today.\\"     I definitely felt like she tried to fit too much going on into one book. Part of what I loved about the first three is that they were simple, focusing on Edward and Bella's relationship. Trying to cram a wedding, a honeymoon, a pregnancy, her change, and a battle royale at the end made the whole thing too contrived.    That being said, there were some things I enjoyed. As much as I hated Jacob imprinting on Nessie, I was so glad it allowed him to be a part of Bella's life without destroying him. And I enjoyed the camaraderie that emerged between Jacob and the vampires because of it.    The chapters between Bella's change and when she is reunited with Nessie are, IMO the best of the book. As someone said earlier, THAT'S the BD I wanted.    Surprisingly, I didn't hate the bond that came about between Bella and Nessie (I know I just said it made me nauseous, but hear me out). The thing that really bothers me is that this does not feel like \\"my\\" Bella, for lack of a better term. The Bella we began with, that fell in love with Edward, etc. I know that characters are supposed to evolve, but this is not the direction I wanted her to go in. I can't picture \\"my\\" Bella as a mother living in a perfect little fairy tale cottage. As I said, I would have enjoyed this so much more if I hadn't been trying to force myself to see \\"my\\" Bella when I read this. Once I started picturing her as someone else, I enjoyed it more.    I can totally see why people would like this book. But to me it just feels so incredibly out of place when put together with the first 3, like it doesn't belong. It feels wrong to me, like reading a fanfiction I know has nothing to do with what really happens in the story and I keep waiting for the release of the real thing.    I just feel like this book ruined the whole series for me, and I'm having trouble remembering why I fell in love with these characters to begin with. I will have to re-read Twilight soon, just so I can begin to get excited about the movie again.    And so, my raging, violent hatred of this book has dissipated to a dull irritation with a nice heaping of disappointment to go with it. But that's not to say that YOU won't like it. So go see for yourself.
B000F9RB9Y|2.0|Really good movie.  But the transfer to Blu-Ray is really poor.  I own many Blu-Ray titles (also the DVD version of this), this is one of the worse Blu-ray transfers I've seen, quality wise.  Lots of grain, and not just during the darker scenes (you will see this immediately at the start).  For the life of me I cannot understand how relatively modern era movies like Terminator (1984) could have quality issues like this in Blu-Ray, while older films in Blu-Ray like Battle of the Bulge (which I also have) look far, far superior image-wise.  I regret purchasing this Blu-Ray disc, my current DVD version would have sufficed.  I really hope they come up with a better, truly HD restored version of this otherwise great sci-fi classic.
031606792X|4.0|You know so what if bella gets everything she wants, sometimes in life thats what we all hope and dream for, i was glad she became a vampire and yeah its a little weird that jacob imprinted on the baby, but why does it have to be about the way real things are in life, its a book a story so no it doesnt have to be like the real world. I think after everything they went through it was good that everyone ended up happy. I throughly enjoyed the book and will read again.
B001BMKOZW|5.0|Daron has put out a great solo Cd with the drummer of System of a Down which will add catchy melodies to everyones head.  He has a knack for writting catchy stuff and you can see his major influence to System.  This is a great solid CD short to the point songs, some fast, some slower but all catchy.  Take this CD and mix it into the new Serj solo CD and you have yourself a makeshift new System CD.... enjoy.    Ron
031606792X|5.0|SPOILERS BELOW    I've read the series, read the reviews and have to wonder what everyone is so direly upset about.  Everything in Breaking Dawn followed what myself and many others anticipated.  It was the fairy tale ending that was expected, with all loose ends wrapped up nice and tightly.      I suppose I can understand the issues with characterizations  because Bella and Edward were not developed in the way they were in the previous books.  However, by my reading, there wasn't anything left to develop.  Only the ending to their story-together.  I understand that people are angry because of the 18 year old pregnancy issue and it sending the \\"wrong\\" message to teens.  No offense, folks, but as a mother of two, teens got the message a long time before stumbling across this book.  Bella didn't want to get pregnant and Edward's reaction (perhaps a common one to some) was of fear for her safety.  Anyone who expected Bella to act differently, to not automatically want to sacrifice her life for the life of another, hasn't paid too much to her characterization from the get go.      With regards to Jacob's imprinting - how did anyone not see that coming?  Am I the only one who read the previous books and when Quil imprinted thought.... Hm, this is important.  Otherwise, the author wouldn't bother to have so many pages devoted to Bella' s reaction.      As for those who are angry at the lack of angst ending, I'm shocked anyone actually expected that.  It has been a fairytale all along and to expect that the author would provide her readers anything but that up to the very end was just to underestimate her commitment to the story she's crafted.  In the perfect world of the Cullens, why would anyone expect anything less than a perfect ending?
031606792X|2.0|I have always been a huge fan of Stephenie's Meyer exquisite series.  The first book, Twilight, captured me from the first chapter, first because of the simplicity of the literature and the mysterious/forbidden love.  I believe, at the end of Twilight, the greateness started to slowly decline.  New Moon was very good, while Eclipse got rather obnoxious with Edward's obsession with having Bella \\"babysat\\" all the time.     But Twilight was on such a higher level than this book.  This series started out as breathtaking, but now is simply lifeless.      **Spoilers AHEAD!!**    The beginning of the book was amazing.  It was the true Stephenie Meyer novel, and I thought that this was going to be the best one of the series.  The wedding scene made me heart bound, because I was scared for Bella, and the fear she felt as she was getting married. And then, after she was married, all of a sudden, she was okay.  She wasn't even worried.  But I overlooked that.    The honeymoon scene was great.  I really enjoyed that whole part, except for when you find out she's pregnant.  For some reason, I sort of started predicting that after she had \\"unexplained\\" emotional attacks as well as crazy food cravings.      And then the book got really good.  You entered Jacob's point of view.  I liked the reality check when you were reading from Jacob's perspective.  Even though Bella had developed and sort of matured as she came to the reality of her marriage with Edward, I still feel Jacob's character was the most interesting.    And then \\"Renesmee\\" (?!) was born.  I am sorry, but that is probably the worst choice of name...and then her middle name? \\"Carlie\\"?  I am sorry!  But I hate when books name their characters after dead/(or in this case) alive/undead parents.  But I predicted that Jacob would imprint on her.  It was really the most horrible thing, not only was it creepy, but Jacob's character had joined Bella as being an \\"undead zombie\\" with no life left WHATSOEVER!    From there, the story went downhill.  The last 300 pages were a horrible let down for me.  I wished that Bella had a harder time getting over the being a newborn vampire than everybody else.  It would have been better.  Also, the last 100 pages almost killed me.  Nothing happened!  And where the epic battle between the Volturi and the united Covens/nomads?  It was all talk.    I am sorely disappointed at the Utopian ending.  I missed the old Bella, who wasn't so \\"powerful\\" but vulnerable yet courageous in her own way.  I miss the magic of the first Twilight book.
031606792X|1.0|Is this a sick joke from the publishing company?  When does the REAL \\"Breaking Dawn\\" come out?  I can't believe that SM actually wrote this book.  It doesn't even sound like the other 3 books.  I am in mourning today.  I have all the same complaints that most others have.  Bella getting pregant?  What????  Jacob imprinting on her baby?????  WHAT???????  And, do NOT even get me started on that stupid name!!!      One of the things that I loved about the first 3 books was that it made me believe that vampires and werewolves COULD be real.  I almost wanted them to be.  That sounds strange maybe, but I just loved how the stories were written.  I felt like this book was unbelievable in every way.      The things we wanted to happen such as the wedding, and the change were given just a few pages and there were no details.  It was all just skimmed over.  But, then entire chapters were given to ridiculous subplots.  I don't know..... I am just in shock and disappointment now. It really pains me to say this.  I wanted to LOVE this book so much that I even tried to talk myself into liking it as I went along.  BUT, the bizarre things continued.  I think that SM had a serious brain freeze here.  She could have gone so many directions on this.  Why oh why did she choose this one?
031606792X|1.0|I have several problems with this novel.     First, it's disappointing how Meyer ignored her own rules she created in this world in order to have this novel work.    Secondly, it frustrates me how Meyer creates such an unrealistic world in Breaking Dawn when the first 3 novels were ones you could immerse yourself in and believe you were really part of it all.   I could see what Meyer was trying to do with Bella becoming pregnant. Making her freak out at first because most people do when it's not planned, especially when they're not ready. Meyer was probably trying to show the readers that teenage pregnancy is real and can happen to anyone. However, it was overshadowed by the fact that Bella became pregnant at age 18 with no realistic consequences and how this novel is anti-feminist. A woman has to be married, have a baby, and have her husband direct her choices in order to be happy? I don't think so.     Lastly, and this ties in with my second point, it just felt like Meyer was cramming her beliefs down my throat. I didn't feel that way with the first three, however (well, not cram-down-the-throat bad). I'm sure that wasn't her intention, but holy crap.    Additionally, I returned my copy of Breaking Dawn today because I couldn't even stand to have the thing. This is the worst novel I've ever read.

031606792X|1.0|I stood in line at my local book shop and purchased my copy of Breaking Dawn, my anticipation mounting. I had a bad feeling about the book to begin with. With all of the craze going on about this Saga I wanted to avoid the story of the love struck teenager and her vampire squeeze, but my mother and sisters finally persuaded me to read them. I seriously could NOT put them down. Sure, it was Dostoevsky or Austen or Shakespeare, but it was entertaining nonetheless. I read all three books in a three day span, and then patiently waited for my own closure with Bella and Edward, who I had grown so attached to through the novels. I am sure that there are other readers out there who feel, or felt,  exactly the same way. I read Breaking Dawn as soon as the novel was in my hands, and as my eyes wandered through page after page I realized that this was mixture between a cheap, poorly written \\"thriller,\\" a grotesque horror story, and a harlequin romance. Page after page my dislike for Stephanie Meyer grew as she tore down the efforts of the past three novels. It felt that she rushed through it, and through a lack of creativity on her own part, threw in as many ridiculous ideas as possible to \\"satisfy\\" her fans. I am so thoroughly disappointed. If she planned on making this saga work, she probably should have just kept it a trilogy and ended at that. This book makes no sense whatsoever, and if the ending wouldn't have been a silly happily ever after, I truly believe that her fans would never forgive her. I have read many of the reviews on this site, and those who have graded it well are right on. The readers who have given Breaking Dawn 5 stars are merely trying to salvage the brand. Furthermore, as I read this book, I imagined the film version of this being played before my eyes. While I am still anticipating the release of the film Twilight, a film version of Breaking Dawn would be ravaged by critics, would not be able to stand on its own, and would be as entertaining as watching The Notebook, Saw, and Catwoman all rolled into one with even worse lines and an even dumber plot. But nonetheless, all of us who are captivated by this romance will read this dreadful book, watch the movie, and walk away a little differently, knowing that another author has made too hefty a promise that they couldn't deliver.

B00005JPY0|1.0|Sorry but I am not one of the fawning masses who love this movie. It is a mind numbing violent sadist mess. The raves about Ledger's performance are only from sympathy. Aaron Eckhart is completely unbelievable - especially his quick transformation from do-gooder to bad guy. I did like Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman though. I was appalled to see all the children in the theater. The movie should have been R rated. After two hours we had enough and walked out. The first Batman remains the best. I know there is talk about others from this same bunch but count me out.
0879309210|2.0|It is an \\"alright\\" book but there are a couple of procedures that I wouldn't do the author's way.  I string differently than his method and find it just fine. There are other things he advises in his book that I was taught never to do by a luthier that I trust.
031606792X|5.0|I'm a huge Twilight fan and honestly, I'm disappointed in many of the reactions I've read to this final book. I don't usually review books but I felt I had to defend this one. For anyone who hasn't read Breaking Dawn,<br /><br />........................SPOILERS AHEAD!.................................<br /><br />First of all, OF COURSE Bella is immature...she's a teenager! Teenagers are dramatic, indecisive, and have trouble seeing past the here and now into the future. I'm actually grateful that Meyer made her grow up a bit in this book. I love Bella but sometimes I just wanted to reach through the pages of the previous books and shake some maturity into her. For everyone that's criticizing her being obsessed with sex, again...she's a teenager. At least Meyer had them do everything the responsible way...love, marriage, sex, THEN the baby. Even with her wanting to extend being human for a little while longer because of the sex sounds very typical of a young person, and also a young married person. She doesn't think that a close physical relationship will be possible for a long time once she becomes a vampire...who can blame her for wanting more than a few weeks of a somewhat normal marriage before the bloodlust kicks in, especially once she realizes what sex is like?<br /><br />Bella doesn't react the way a normal teenage girl does when she finds out she's pregnant but then again, Bella doesn't react to anything the way a normal person should at any time in the series so why should this be any different? Plus, normal teenage girls aren't usually married to a 90 year old vampire with gobs of money lying around and in-laws that would do anything to support her. Takes a little bit of the edge off of the discovery, if you ask me. And, like I mentioned about her maturity, I'm impressed at the level she showed during the pregnancy (how many teenage girls do you know that wouldn't run right out and get an abortion?) as well as after her vampire conversion. Those that are criticizing Meyer for bad messages in the book, she's advocating waiting until marriage to have sex and having the power to make a choice over your own body. I'm in full agreement on those two.<br /><br />While the baby did surprise me, it also helped with several aspects of the story. It made friends of Rosalie and Bella, which may never have happened any other way. Rosalie had given up hope of ever having a child and, yes, I'm sure she was jealous of Bella but that's really no different than any other human person who can't have a baby and is jealous when someone close to them gets pregnant. Renesmee is a miracle though and Rosalie gives all the love to her that she would have given to her own child. Some may say that's not enough but it's a happier ending for Rosalie than I could have thought up. And of course Bella called Rosalie once she found out she was pregnant. She wanted to keep the baby and was afraid that choice would be taken from her and knew that Rosalie, of all people, would help protect that choice. Also, Edward was always so worried that Bella would miss out on typical human things. Childbirth is definitely one of those typical human things that she wouldn't realize she wanted until she got older and it was too late. I think it was wonderful that one of the last things Bella did in her \\"living\\" life was to bring another life into the world.<br /><br />Okay...the imprinting. I'm not saying that I saw that one coming but it really makes sense of the whole Bella-Jacob relationship, doesn't it? I mean, didn't anyone else think, even for just a minute, that Jacob really did imprint on Bella and just didn't realize that he'd done it? I did. His feelings were so strong for her that would have been a good reason. But, him imprinting on Renesmee explained those feelings and also cut those ties he had to Bella. My heart just broke for Jacob and the pain he went through over Bella and I'm happy that he was able to move on without Bella and Jacob sacrificing their friendship.<br /><br />On to another point of contention that I've read about several times in the reviews...Bella's power. I was actually very happy for Bella after her conversion. She had wanted all of this so badly I would have hated it for her if her looks didn't change, if she was still a klutz, and if she had no decent power except the ability to block people from her head. But Meyer gave her the looks and the grace that Bella had been lacking as a human and expanded drastically on the anomaly that she'd had when she was human and made her, as a newborn vampire even, pretty powerful. Bella had always been self-sacrificing, always wanting to protect those around her and it was fitting that her power allowed her to protect so many from Jane and Alec...and she'll only get stronger as she learns to control it better.<br /><br />Maybe everything did work out a little bit too neatly in the end, but it's a love story, a fairy tale, not a tragedy like Romeo and Juliet. We wanted a happy ending, right? Bella made the choices that she did expecting to give up everything for love but in the end didn't really have to give up what she thought. What's so wrong with that? She was prepared to make big sacrifices for love but in the end had her happy ending. Would we all have wanted her to never see her father again and spend years in Alaska because she couldn't control her craving for blood? Or would we have wanted her to back out of the wedding last minute because she couldn't give up what she thought she'd have to? For all of Bella's failings she knew her own mind and stuck with her choices and everything worked out for the best in the end. I don't see anything wrong with that.r point of contention that I've read about several times in the reviews...Bella's power. I was actually very happy for Bella after her conversion.

031606792X|2.0|Okay, I read all 3 Twilight books super quickly and devoured them, but I have to admit (even though I really don't want to) that \\"Breaking Dawn\\" just flat out sucked. To me, making Bella pregnant simply ripped out the theme of unrequited, teenage love seen throughout the first 3 novels. All of a sudden, the baby made things majorly serious and instead of the playful, carefree, and immature Bella became an adult....I mean....wow. Making her have a baby just angers me SO MUCH! ugh!   Also, why the hell did she split it up into 3 different books? Talk about inconsistency between novels 1-3 and 4. I felt like it wasnt even SM who wrote this 4th novel...it was that utterly shocking.     And now I have to admit this---which some will probably roll their eyes at---but the romantic scenes between Bella and Edward were were simply, i don't know, plain. I'm so used to scenes that draw me in and make me blush.....but these scenes were annoyingly flat, uninteresting, and quite frankly boring. I mean, we've waited 3 books for Bella and Edward to consummate their relationship, and all we get are these dull descriptions that go nowhere. I don't know, does anyone agree with me here?     I'm so fustrated, that I think I'll go back and re-read Eclipse and pretend like that was the last book in the saga. SM.....you need to rewrite this book. Seriously.      The only reason I give it 2 stars is because Bella and Edward wind up together. AKA the only redeeming quality of this book.

031606792X|3.0|The book was ok, but not what I expected for the last novel in the series. I mean I don't understand the whole Jacob/Nessie imprinting thing. It was weird. Apart of me is mad at Stephanie for selling out Jake like that. Even though I knew Jake would not end up with Bella I still thought that maybe he would end up with another character (maybe Leah) but not Bella and Edward's daughter.     Then I felt that it was wrong to use Jake and Bella's relationship as something that was meant to happen only because he would later imprint on Bella's daughter. What the heck is that about??!! I mean are you saying the only reason that they formed a bond is because of Nessie? I just don't get it? And what happens to Leah? I mean what happens to her character?     I think personally that the physical love scenes with Bella and Edward were not as geniune. I felt like they were more intimate with each other in the other books than in this one where they finally do have sex. Describing thier physical love for another was not established to me enough. It was weird to read about Bella as a mother and a wife. It took me by surprise that her character gained strength and maturity.   This book does not seem complete. Stephanie is going to have to write another book to finish this one because this book leaves you hanging.   C.S
031606792X|5.0|This book was all I could have asked for and more, it ends the Twilight Saga answering all questions and ties up all loose ends. The Perfect ending to the perfect series.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|wow, all the times itried to imagine how this story would end i didn't even come close to the storyline in breaking dawn.  some may not be happy due to that this storyline was very unlike the first three novels and really altered  bella into someonethey probably wouldn't relate to as they had been able to in the past.  i think the fact that once again meyer0s is able to craft a storyline that is so unprdictable and mesmorizing that iwas barely able to put the book down is the proof ineed of a great story.  this is amust read.
031606792X|5.0|This was a great book.  Reading it was a wonderful way to spend a Saturday. I have been eagerly awaiting this release and I wasn't disappointed.
031606792X|5.0|I finished the book earlier this morning and have spent all day since then checking out websites and discussion boards about the series, and I cannot believe the negative response people are having to this book!!     Yes, I understand that a lot of VERY unpredictable things happened, no one was expecting Bella to get pregnant, but why is that such a bad thing???  It's not like Stephenie Meyer is saying \\"teen pregnancy is the way to go\\" or anything-THIS IS FANTASY.  You can't compare their relationship to anyone else's.  Also, they ARE married.    Also, I was thrilled when Jacob imprinted on Renesme, why is everyone freaking out!!  Now Bella and Jacob can truly be family without the crazy love triangle that makes them both miserable!      One last thing--For anyone that hated this book or feel \\"disappointed\\" in Stephenie Meyer, take a deep breath and read it again.  Once you get over the fact that all of your brilliant theories didn't turn out exactly how you imagined, I'm sure you'll fully enjoy and appreciate Breaking Dawn.      Also, It's not like Stephenie Meyer is going to leave you high and dry!  We all know there's going to be more books coming, just not from Edward and Bella's perspective.      So all in all, I thought the book was completely amazing, I nice ending to an amazing series, and I'm still shaking my head in wonder at all of the horrible reviews I am seeing.      P.S. THIS IS STEPHENIE MEYER'S SERIES, PEOPLE. IF YOU DON'T LIKE HOW SHE ENDED THINGS, GO WRITE YOUR OWN ENDING.
031606792X|1.0|I'm just glad I got my copy from the library.  I would have been even more disappointed to shell out $22 for this farce.    I stumbled on the series this spring and instantly fell in love with it.  I couldn't wait to read the conclusion.      Are these even the same people?  What happened??  And, the Jacob imprinting thing was way too creepy.  Really?      I was sorely disappointed with the entire book.  Sorry.

B00005JPY0|5.0|After hearing and reading all that is said about the Dark Knight, I can add that there are strong performances from all actors.  The Joker is the best I've ever seen, because he is defined as a \\"moralist,\\" and not just a madman.  His conviction is no worse than any belligerent nationalist, dictator, or ultra conservative.  In my understanding, everyone is either a madman or a saint; it depends on who needs what you have.  Nevertheless, Batman is as mysterious as ever, showing his human weaknesses, which makes him more charming.  Policeman, Lt. Gordon, doesn't distract from the big picture, but facilitates sympathy for the police department, and innocent citizens, maintaining sanity, while everybody else is variable.  Lucius Fox, gadget genius, is dedicated to always doing the \\"right thing,\\" and solidifies the trio of himself, Batman, and Alfred, the manservant, who all work together to keep Batman alive.  The district attorney, Harvey Dent, is as memorable as the Joker is, because he has a yin/yang quality, some light and dark all rolled into one that, when viewed objectively, makes their choices inevitable.  We just should be thankful that our environment hasn't driven us to such extremes.  I can feel some pity for the Joker, because he sees the corruption of government just as that of organized crime, and is truly \\"mad\\" trying to even the playing field.  Of course, he just adds to the problem, but the point is that the good guys are not all that good; they just fight on that side.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great movie.  I saw it in IMAX, which just adds more length and width to the screen, and more decibels to the speakers.  A regular-sized theater screen is probably just as good.  This film would be great viewing on even an iPod.<br /><br />In conclusion, The Dark Knight is like a finely blended alcoholic cocktail, made with 200 Proof liquor (100% liquor) and fresh fruit juices.  Although the natural juices will disguise the strong booze taste, in a little while, you will be affected by the liquor.  I left the theater feeling a little more deranged by the dynamic sounds, visions, and morality of it all.ill be affected by the liquor.

B001BR5F4C|5.0|Who in their right mind would wait for one combined film of 3-4 hours on one Blu-ray?  That would have to be compressed to all hell even on a 50 gig disc.  Color fight scenes are cool but, the whole reason to buy blu-ray is for picture quaility.  You go ahead and wait for your color fight scenes that will look like crap because their compressed to all hell to try and fit both movies,extra features,lossless audio,and the rest of the stuff onto one Blu-ray.  I don't think it would fit onto one dvd.  You can take your color fight scenes and I'll take my superior picture quaility.  Just saw today that it has been confirmed that each movie will be 50 gigs.  Just thought I'd let you know in case you didn't.
031606792X|5.0|I loved Breaking Dawn, it was suspensful and I liked how it tied all of the books together. I do not see why people are bashing the book I found it truly enjoyable.
B0000CF300|5.0|Folks, I never told you what happened to me some time ago. Since I am revealing great mysteries about me, I might as well tell you this. I was captured by the enemy (you know who you are!) and a sequence of A Clockwork Metamorpho went into effect. Yes. They strapped me to a chair, prodded my eyes open and I was forced to view a screen that alternated between a message that read \\"You Will Take Your Reviews Seriously!\\" and pictures of disappointed shoppers leaving a store and burning me in effigy. Believe me, this was unsettling. I was programmed, however Marshy and Sondra got me out of it with belly dances. But not totally. Thus, I am doing this one because it deserves it and because I am a victim of the past (but trying to escape it totally).<br /><br />Do know that I am dressed in my cosmic cowboy best to write this. One must get into the mood. But, Gene Clark, well, that's a Byrd of a different feather for sure. Who is he? Well, when the Byrds came into prominence he was an incredible songwriter and delivered some of their best tunes in the rock vein. Eventually he left because of band squabbles. And what are most squabbles about? Money, of course. He was getting royalties when the others weren't and so..... gone!<br /><br />But, everything he did subsequently was of such a high caliber (and not in keeping with the pure pop arena) that it beckons me to write this. This is a man who wrote absolutely superb songs that most people have not heard of. In fact, he is one of Metamorpho's best kept secrets revealed to you here for the first time.<br /><br />As life flows and moves, it has always been a mystery that there are people out there that can create such works of beauty but still go unnoticed by many people. Gene is one of those artists. He was never recognized fully in his lifetime, but this selection speaks volumes about his ability and his craft.<br /><br />Before I go any further, please realize that \\"No Other\\" is a rare find. There are reflections here that are very deep. On the surface, you don't recognize it. But, on many listenings you get into more and more depth. Gene was complex and very much into finding the elements of the soul to channel back to you. These are not songs to take lightly. There is much more here than anyone can imagine.<br /><br />\\"No Other\\" is not a rock/pop offering by any means. The songs here have an underlying country sound mixed with contemporary considerations. The outline is reliant upon Gene's acoustic guitar with bass, slide guitar, drums, piano etc. added in. The essence is acoustic though. Gene's vocal is reminiscent of a country vocal, but not quite. There is a world weary sadness behind his singing. I cannot describe it exactly, but I know it is there. In all the songs and the changes, there is nothing to throw you off the thrust of where the music is going. Yet, there are little tidbits here, little excursions of sound, that make this selection so pleasing to hear.<br /><br />But it's the content, the voice and words that come back to haunt you. I believe he was a poet, a modern day troubadour that never found the audience he deserved. He reveals himself so eloquently with the lines from \\"Life's Greatest Fool\\"<br /><br />Words can be empty, though filled with sound<br />stoned numb and drifting, hard to be profound<br />formed out of pleasure, chiselled by pain<br />Never the highest, and not the last one to gain<br /><br />Plus he offers inner wisdom with these words from \\"Some Misunderstanding\\"<br /><br />Maybe someone knows what fate is, maybe someone knows just why<br />All I know is it's all ... related, Maybe someone can explain time<br />But I know if you sell..your soul, to brighten your role<br />you might be disappointed in the lights...<br /><br />Gene never sold his soul. He was responsible to his inner muse, his inner calling only, and that calling produced songs of such beauty and finesse.<br />He certainly was the cosmic cowboy, but the songs here have a natural balance. You are never beaten over the head with the groove of it, in fact, it is so subtle that you work to bring it out to your own mind. This is his magic as a songwriter. He was overshadowed by many singer-songwriters of the era such as James Taylor, Carole King, Jackson Browne, etc. etc. But Gene is just as vital in his own unique style.<br /><br />This selection includes the 8 songs he recorded for Asylum in 1975 plus the addition of 7 out-takes from the session. In all honesty, the out takes are just as superb as the released tunes. They are stripped down to their essence and you can see what production accomplished. However, they perfectly convey the vision and what he was after in the studio. It has been documented that Gene had an undiagnosed bi-polar disorder. It has been told to me that these people feel things more in-depth than most. It is evident here. This wonderous artist died much too young. But, his testimony lives on and it would be criminal not to give him a serious listen. It would be an honest journey of reflection - but well worth the taking.<br /><br />Now, let me stop here before they take your poor Metamorpho away and force me to see that video again. You don't want me to stop my frivolity all together now, would you? O.K., don't all rush to the stage at once! Leave me a panic room at least!<br /><br />Your Kozmic seer -- Metamorpho ;)ing it out to your own mind. This is his magic as a songwriter.

B0018AK9RA|1.0|I feel the need to warn all the Priest fans out there.... Stay Away from this one! You'd be better off to just buy a \\"Wham!\\" c.d., than spend your hard earned money on this. Unless you REALLY LIKE KEYBOARDS!!!     All the \\"Halford\\" stuff is cool, and the last c.d., \\"Angel of Retribution\\" totally rocks, so I thought that \\"Nostradamus\\" would follow suit. WRONG! I had to fast foward through the whole thing, looking for one good song. Oh wait, there is a bonus here.....you get two bad discs instead of one.     This is a painful listening experience. Run away as fast as you can!! C'mon you guys, you're killing me!    I gave one star because they wouldn't let me leave it blank!
B0015DYIH2|4.0|I love the whole saga...Breaking Dawn to me is as about closing all questions that I had after the Eclipse and opening doors to other possibilities for the other characters involved.  It's not as intense as the other three books, but diffinetly worth the read if you started from the beginning.  Stephanie really showed the life and struggle for Bella and Edward and I feel the ending was justified.  Sweet, and true not so realistic, but I wanted the happy ending.  Stephanie did not cut corners like others when trying to transition plot lines, she explained and gave me a full belly.  Great book, I recommend it....
B000002BPS|5.0|I've been listening to the Offspring for about eight years now, but for some reason I never picked this one up until recently. It hasn't yet grown on me like Smash or even Conspiracy of One, but it has some great tracks, many of which are really funny.    I rate the tracks with all other Offspring songs in mind.    Disclaimer: 5/5 - Really hilarious and clever intro, probably the best of any of the Offspring albums, if not a little over the top...    The Meaning of Life: 4.5/5 - Great energetic opener, what you would expect, but not quite as powerful as Americana's \\"Have You Ever\\" and Smash's \\"Nitro\\".    Mota: 3/5 - This has one of those great little high-powerchord intro riffs that the Offspring are known for, and it really sets a good mood for this faced-paced satirical song. But not one of my favorite off the album, probably because the chorus isn't as cool as the verse.    Me & My Old Lady: 4.5/5 - Longest song ont he album, Really catchy riff and verse rhythm, and the brief lead guitar melody near the beginning is a nice difference from other songs. I think this songs \\"she aint no ball and chain\\" was probably influenced by the Social Distortion song, but maybe not...    Cool To Hate: 5/5 - Just an awesome well-paced song, the lyrics are brilliant. Probably the most memorable track from the album. I only wish I hated this song, so I could be cool    Leave It Behind: 4/5 - A good short and fast follow-up to that last song.  The opening riff makes me think of \\"Genocide\\".    Gone Away: 5/5 - Really not a typical-sounding Offspring song; The intro and verse vocals sound more like they are off a grunge or alternative rock album. The chorus is very memorable, too. This rates as one of the Offspring's best slower songs.    I Choose:  3.5/5 - Hahaha, the first 1.5 seconds of this always throw me off because it sounds like that Van Halen song \\"Unchained\\". The main riff and rhythm of this song are cool, but I just don't like the vocals on this song. I'm sure others mightstrongly disagree with me. Though it does have a nice solo about midway through.    Intermission: 5/5 - Ahhhhhh....    All I Want: 5/5 - So the guitar parts aren't quite as interesting as other songs on the album, but this quick song has an awesome vocal melody.     Way Down the Line: 4/5 - Song about how kids turn out just like their parents. Has one of those Offspring choruses similar to One Fine Day or Walla Walla.    Don't Pick It Up: 4/5 - I like how this song almost sounds like its gonna be serious at the start. This is the obligatory ska-punk-sounding song on the album and its pretty funny.    Amazed: 3.5/5 - Not-typical-Offspring in a similar way as \\"Gone Away\\". If you've listened to the Conspiracy album, the chorus sounds similar to \\"Vultures\\", but a little better. I think the main thing I don't like about the song is its placement after \\"Don't Pick it Up\\". The guitar is pretty unspectacular compared with other songs on Ixnay except for the interesting little lead melody at the beginning.    Change the World: 4/5 - Starts with that mysterious interesting guitar riff that ended the song \\"Smash\\" on the previous album. I like how it builds off of that with drums, 2nd guitar etc. This song always reminds me of that song \\"Revolution\\" by the Beatles.    I should add that I don't really listen to any punk, mostly classic rock, progressive and instrumental rock, and some metal. But the Offspring is a great band with diverse albums I love to listen to straight through. it never gets dull, it never gets old. If you're just getting into their music, definitely go for something like Smash first instead of the newest albums; but if you have that one already, Ixnay is an excellent choice, as is Ignition or Americana.

This might be solely a jab at the state and absurdity of modern religion, except right now in India there is a village where the people joinly practice Islam and Hinduism and likewise the great Poobahs have decided that they shouldn't practice religion that way.<br /><br />We move on and Pi and his family are on their way to  a Canadian zoo and  when the ship sinks and Pi,a zebra, a hyena and Richard Parker, the tiger are stranded alone on a life boat where Pi all but abandons religions in the name of day to day survival. What follows is a thrillingly probable, improbable set of adventures.<br /><br />In case we miss some of the finer points, there are study question<br /><br />Buy this if you like entertainment or or if you want to delve deeper into the dangerous abyss of challenging our own belief systems.
B000I2IT44|5.0|I consider myself pretty knowledgeable when it comes to music and bands but for some reason this band was not on my musical radar. What a mistake! A buddy turned me on to a couple of tracks, one being Blackest Eyes, and I found myself doing a double take. I wasted no time in ordering this DVD and continue to be thoroughly impressed. This is one killer live band! The musicianship is top shelf as are the compositions. Gavin Harrison is not only a superb drummer with great chops, he is extremely tasty. He doesn't let his chops get in the way of playing for the song.<br />I've never been one who needed a band to have a flashy light show and dry ice machines or fireworks to impress me. I'm all about the music and this band delivers bigtime! There's no striking of the obligatory rock star poses here, the band pretty much stands fairly still but still kicks all kinds of you-know-what. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who likes superb, well executed rock tunes on the progressive side.<br />You can keep your overly choreographed shows with the obligatory scantily clad dancers who add nothing to the show. That's all fluff and eye candy. This is ear candy and it's the real deal!!<br />[...]
B0013J9KOO|5.0|Better than the original, \\"Hellboy II\\" is pure fantasy adventure.  For thousands of years, the world of humans and the world of supernatural creatures has been at peace, but an angry Prince Nuada is determined to bring about a war between the two.  Knowing that Hellboy is shunned and repulsed by humans, the prince tries to lure Hellboy to his side.<br /><br />  The sequel is more emotional than the original.  It involves love found and lost.  Hellboy's relationship with Liz Sherman is strained; they are on the brink of separation.<br /><br />  There is a secret world of goblins, faeries, hags and trolls hidden beneath Manhattan's Brooklyn Bridge.  This reminded me very much of the \\"Harry Potter\\" series where witches and other supernatural creatures have their own banks, trains, and shopping districts hidden behind magical walls.  However, many of the creatures in \\"Hellboy II\\" bore a closer resemblance to the aliens found in \\"Star Wars\\" or \\"The Fifth Element.\\"  Indeed, the institution where Hellboy lives is becoming more like the one in \\"Men in Black.\\"  Furthermore, the prince reminded me of an emaciated Vampire Lestat in \\"Interview with the Vampire.\\"<br /><br />  Yes, \\"Hellboy II\\" does seem to imitate a lot of classic science fiction movies, but it still remains unique in its own way.  Every one of us can identify with Hellboy because we have all been rejected at one time or another.<br /><br />  \\"Hellboy II\\" is packed with gruesome, terrifying creatures.  The most horrific are the Tooth Faeries - four-legged insect-like creatures with round heads and big mouths full of razor-sharp teeth.  They are like piranha with wings; they fly in swarms and ferociously devour all flesh, bone, and muscle and leave no trace of the victim except when they defecate.  Simply gross!
031606792X|5.0|I am a huge Stephenie Meyer fan.  She has gotten children, teens, adults and seniors to READ!!  How awesome is that.  I wasn't a reader until someone put Twilight in front of me.<br />Then she gave us New Moon and Eclipse.  The wonderful imagination of hers kept unfolding.<br /><br />Now we have Breaking Dawn.  Looking at the reviews on Amazon, people think this is some sort of guide to Help Raise Your Teenage Daughter or about pedophilia.  Did anyone read what Imprinting was in Eclipse or you just read this and came to your own conclusions?  Chill out people.<br /><br />This is a FANTASY.  IT'S FICTION. FAKE.<br /><br />This is her imagination, this is what she wanted to happen.<br /><br />Twilight, New Moon and Eclipse, were her beginning.  You can tell from her writing that this was new to her.  With much practice, writing other books and reading others, you can tell that her writing has progressed to a more high level writing skill.<br /><br />My head is still in this world that she wonderfully put in my head.<br /><br />Spoilers:<br /><br />Looking back at her interviews and such, she's always said about Jacob and Edward, \\"why can't she keep both?\\"  Bella gets to keep both. Aww.. She made both crowds happy.<br /><br />Bella no longer relatable?  She was in the beginning. But now she's a vampire. Who can actually relate to that?  Stephenie did that on purpose. Another part of the ending.<br /><br />People were worried about her not being able to experience the most important thing a human can experience. Stephenie added the baby, the ultimate experience.<br /><br />Bella got her wish to be with Edward forever, the way she's always wanted.<br /><br />There is no \\"message\\" as people keep saying. It's a story about love, how it conquers all and family love.<br /><br />Amazon reviewers keep mentioning the fact that she's Mormon and a mother.<br />She's human first. With a wonderful imagination.  Her background shouldn't be the main focus of what you're reading. Vampire love story.<br /><br />I hope she keeps writing and getting people of all ages to continue reading..
031606792X|1.0|As the, er, dawn of Breaking Dawn edged closer, and the spoilers started coming out, I found myself refusing to believe them. After all, they went against so much of what had happened in the previous books (case in point: vampires having babies). I was in disbelief even as the chapters themselves started to trickle in. It was just too bad - horrific fanfiction. The characters were out of character (Renee is psyched for her daughters wedding, after three books of being vehemently against marrying early. Bella dreads marriage, only to discover after the ceremony that it is everything she has ever wanted. She loathes the idea of children only to find, again, that she loves it after it happened). Bella, basically a Mary Sue before this book, loses absolutely nothing. Everything goes perfectly for her. Meyer, again, pays no attention to her previous books as Bella finds herself pregnant (supposedly impossible), Edward finds himself unable to recognize this (despite two rounds of medical school), and no one realizes that the baby might want blood (even though it is half-vampire). The list goes on, really. And, oh, look, a deus ex machina! And another! What to do with Jacob? Let's have him imprint on the demon spawn! That's handy! So not only was the new book complete with Meyer's usual sub-par writing, but the plot was awful as well. I found myself aching for the book to be over with already. The ultimate showdown with the Volturi, billed as a major plot point, barely happened. What a let down.     And the morals! Meyer claims that Bella is a strong female character, but the only way that would be possible would be if strength was basically the equivalent of getting a man, a baby, and nice cottage in the woods, and giving up every bit of one's own character and beliefs. She refuses to grow as a person, instead preferring to be attached to a man she likes mostly because he is hot (it cannot be anything else - they never talk about anything but how much they love each otherand, later, the demon spawn). It's an empty book with bad morals full of empty people and bad plot contrivances.     I really, honestly, wish I had not wasted the time to read this piece of trash. If, after reading all of these negative reviews, you still want to read this massive piece of fail, I beg you not to give any of your money to such an awful writer, as well as whatever sort of editor would allow this to be published.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|Absolutley exceptional CD \\"Crayons\\".  A must buy!  Great to have Donna back!!!  Another exceptional CD is Donna Summer's, \\"20th Century Masters-The Christmas Collection\\". You will truly feel Christmas reach out and touch you!
B0018AK9RA|5.0|Another metal band has once again proved that metal contains historical, mythological, spiritual, and even scholarly substance. Concept albums like Judas Priest's new album \\"Nostradamus\\" are a rare find these days and something the music world has been lacking.<br /><br />Following the life of the 16th century prophet Nostradamus, Judas Priest captures the social and historical ramifications of one person's quest still felt 500 years later. With brilliant packaging, and a bonus box set version, Priest offers not one but two full length discs with 23 tracks and nearly two hours worth of music. We can imagine the guys in Iron Maiden kicking themselves for not thinking of this one.<br /><br />This album may not be their prime work, but it showcases their diverse talent and the evolution of a band that spans four decades. Now that I've reminded early fans just how old they are, it's important to remember that the guys in the band are in their 50s! Songs like \\"Visions\\" sound like they are right out of the 80s prime of metal, but the album has the overall depth and maturity that even the best 80s metal bands never achieved. Most bands didn't and still don't get past a decade.<br /><br />All of the guitars are solid and Rob Halford tops every English metal singer in the world when he breaks into an Italian chorus in the melodic \\"Pestilence and Plague.\\" Halford's grown into a diverse and interesting voice. I'd like to see his listening collection. \\"Alone\\" sounds like Neil Diamond on metal-- a great thing! Other songs like \\"New Beginnings\\" sounds like it's right off of a Phantom-esqe Broadway show. But before I scare you off with these comparisons, there are some heavy hitters like the opening \\"Prophecy\\", \\"Revelations\\", the violent sounding \\"War\\" and \\"Nostradamus\\" at the end of disc two.<br /><br />While it's no surprise that this album isn't a headbanging thrash album, there are songs on it that you can bang your head to. Here is a metal album that you can rock to, that will make you appreciate history, make you want to learn Italian, and make you want to read more. Any metal album that makes you rock and think at the same time is a sure hit.make you want to learn Italian, and make you want to read more.

031606792X|5.0|Stephenie Meyer has always told us she is not an author, but a story teller.. committed to her characters-- when she writes, she ends up with a product she didn't initially expect (e.g., the character of Jacob was only to be a literary tool of another point of view, etc. -- see her website on a full explanation of his character's evolution). That being said, I am wholly satisfied with the finale of this series. I wish people wouldn't take it all so seriously and just enjoy the ride she has given us. I see everyone's looking for political statements, positions on teenage marriage & pregnancy, etc. Please read Breaking Dawn again for what is... the conclusion of these characters she has so passionately wrote about these past few years. Well done, Stephenie!! If you ever get to read this review, I hope you know I love all your books, and your brilliant mind.
B00140PK6O|5.0|I just finished watching the BBC's Cranford miniseries and it was wonderful.  The series is set in a small town in 1840s England.  Cranford is a town full of unmarried women (very common at the time with all of the men who had died in the Napoleonic wars and those who had gone to the colonies--India, etc) where social decorum and gossip are equally important.  Change is afoot in Cranford as the railroad comes into the area and small town life threatens to change forever.  The miniseries aptly captures the mood of the age, showing the emotion of the townspeople in a memorable way.<br /><br />This is a wonderful ensemble piece, even though Judi Dench really does steal just about every scene she's in.  All of the main characters are well developed, and as you learn their back-stories you like them even more.  When the miniseries was over I wanted more--so I will definitely be renting the other BBC Elizabeth Gaskell movies.<br /><br />I had never seen any series based on Elizabeth Gaskell novels before, so if you are in doubt, I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys Jane Austen, Louisa May Alcott, or even the recent BBC version of Bleak House.  The miniseries is done with all of the usual BBC taste so be ready to enjoy some quality period fun!
031606792X|1.0|Although decision making is warped in the first three volumes; this volume is warped squared. By writing this book she displaces the literary symbol of the vampire and we now have her supporting the dumb blonde image.
031606792X|1.0|I won't rehash all the wrongs with this book, but I will add my \\"horribly disappointed\\" to the mix. It just didn't fit - it was like that child's song \\"One of these things is not like the other, one of these things just doesn't belong.\\"<br /><br />Loved the first three. Could've enjoyed this book had it not been a part of a series; it felt too much like a completely different book, a stand alone and not part of the series.<br /><br />Maybe us fans just really had in mind were it was going, so this book was completely crushing because of that? Perhaps we anticipated too much how the series was going to end? Going into the final books in other series, I've never been this disappointed, so I just don't know. All I know is I wasted a sunny Saturday being saddened by something I'd been looking so forward to.<br /><br />Oh well. I'll read her again - I just won't read THIS book again any time soon.
1416550518|5.0|This book owes a great debt (duly noted in the acknowledgments) to Upstairs, Downstairs, Remains of the Day, Gosford Park, The Blind Assassin and anything by DuMaurier, and I think that Kate Morton does her literary and cinematic ancestors proud.<br /><br />The story is cunningly written, and though I often gripe about being able to spot plot points in advance, I did not see what would happen ahead of time.  This was a refreshing change.  There was only one instance where I knew a plot point before the protagonist did, but it was tangential to the main storyline, and the clues laid out before us were meant to lead us in that direction, so I don't consider that a flaw.<br /><br />These are the kinds of sprawling, layered novels that I love most.  Someone looking back over her life reveals a lifetime worth of secrets and reading the novel is like peeling an onion.  I tried to ration out my reading of it, because I knew I would never want it to end, but finally I had to give in to my desire to see what would happen next and how all the ends would tie together.<br /><br />Fascinating reading - on the basis of this book I already have The Forgotten Garden on my wish list.
0920668364|1.0|This is the weirdest chidren's book I have ever read.  I had to throw it away, could not even give it away!!!!
031606792X|1.0|*spoilers*  Outrage is more like it. Meyer once stated this ending would make everyone happy. Not the case. That ridiculous baby  story line came out of NOWHERE and was mostly disgusting. I thought Meyer also said t1he point of Edward and Bella's \\"epic love\\" was that she realized she had real love for Jacob and could see a future with him YET she still choose Edward. The sacrifice of her humanity is what made her choice deeper. But nooooo. Bella gets everything. Edward, a baby, no problems being a vamp, her family knows, and Jacob around forever. Jacob imprinting on the thing? NO. Just no. It goes against everything about Jacobs character.     Besides the things that disgusted me. I was also disappointed in how Meyer seemed to forget how to write her own characters. Everyone was doing and saying things that their characters in former books never would have. I know that they were going through a terrifying situation but still something felt missing. Like the core of who they were was no longer there.
031606792X|1.0|I absolutely loved the first three books, and I expected Breaking Dawn to be just as amazing. However, I was very disappointed with it. Not only did the characters seem completely different than in the previous books, but the whole pregnancy plot twist was terrible. Having Bella pregnant was bad enough, but did Stephenie Meyer really have to put it in the last book?   The middle part  of the book where Jacob was telling the story also dragged on, though it made me like him a bit more. Then I read on and found out that he imprints on Bella's daughter, which creeped me out, to be honest.  The ending of the book was the best part, but I don't think it was good enough to make up for how awful the beginning and middle were.  Overall, it just wasn't very good and I expected so much more from Stephenie Meyer.
B00005JKNF|4.0|In a screenplay by Julian Fellowes, and through the imaginations of Bob Balaban and the late director, Robert Altman, viewers find themselves transported to the upper crust society of 1932 England, where  the devious Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) and his elegant and aristocratic, but cold wife,Lady Sylvia(Kristen Scott Thomas) host variegated guests at their country estate for a weekend shooting party.     Young Mary Maceachran(Kelly Macdonald)accompanies her employer, Constance, the Countess of Trenham (Dame Maggie Smith)to her niece's estate, encountering actor/singer/composer, Ivor Novello, Sir William's second cousin (an amiable and very gifted Jeremy Northam), on the road with friend and producer, Morris Weissman (a crude Bob Balaban) en route to the same destination.    Others arriving at the estate on that rainy November day include the hostess' sisters Louisa and Lavinia(Geraldine Sommerville, Natasha Wightman) and Lord Stockbridge and Commander Meredith (Charles Dance and Tom Hollander). The McCordle's daughter Isobel (Camilla Rutherford), greets her suitor, Lord Rupert Standish (Lawrence Fox), who is accompanied by his friend, Mr. Jeremy Blond (Trent Ford). The Nesbitts, Freddie and Mabel (James Wilby and Claudey Blakely) are a couple who happen to be broke, and their relationship is tense and volatile.   The butler, Jennings (Alan Bates) greets the guests at the entrance and directs the servants upon their arrival. Indoors, the downstairs set are directed by Mrs. Wilson ( Helen Mirren), the chief housekeeper. The other notable servants in this drama include Mrs. Croft (Eileen Atkins), Probst, the valet (Derek Jacobi), Robert Parks (a subtly charismatic Clive Owen) a gauche and mysterious Henry Denton(Ryan Phillippe)who tries to seduce Mary at one point, and head housemaid, Elsie (a hard-bitten Emily Watson), who, like more than one before her,  knows her employer quite intimately.    During an afternoon tea, Novello finds himself at the receivingend of Constance's caustic views of his career, but also on the receiving end of Mabel's admiration.    In the style and tradition of episodes of \\"Mystery\\" and \\"Masterpiece Theater\\", we are led through the upper crust rituals of formal dinners, games of pool, and the shooting party itself.    After one of many scandalous  secrets is revealed, Novello is called to ease the tension by playing a few numbers. \\"I Can Give You the Starlight\\" was composed seven years after this story takes place. Yet despite this inaccuracy, I found myself glad it was included. The piano stylings of Jeremy Northam and/or his brother, Christopher liven things up more than a little, and the well-enunciated, Broadway-ish singing voice of the former, allegedly developed during a real-life stint as a singing waiter, is a pleasant one. Watching the servants dance to the distant sound of his tunes is priceless, emphasizing the spontaneous joy of the downstairs set.    When the host is found dead in his study, with his ever-present dog close at hand, the reaction of those present is one of temporary stunned surprise and horror, even by the widow.    Stephen Fry's Inspector Thompson is called in, along with assistant Constable Dexter (Ron Webster).   While some tears are shed, generally, the crisis is met with stereotypical British reserve, as the widow and daughter entertain their guests clad in mourning. But more unflattering secrets about the departed are revealed, along with the pretentiousness of some of the upstairs set. Constable Dexter's summary of this world is one of dead-on precision: \\"It's a poisonous paradise.\\"    Soon, many of those involved find themselves making life-altering choices, and those unable to do so are left to new dilemmas and/or to their grief--not just over the deceased, but also in several instances, to issues pertaining to his treatement of them.   The reprise of Novello's \\"The Land of Might-Have-Been\\" proves a fitting conclusion for the piece-- a sweet and sour slice of upper-crust life of a by-gone era, that makes fine viewing for quiet evenings in.
0143143492|2.0|I found this cd very boring. The writers has a mono tone voice that never shows any excitement or expression. It's really hard for me to sit through listening to this cd. This is my first bad reveiw on anything on Amazon. What the writer talks about might be helpful, it's just the way it is delivered that is bad.
031606792X|1.0|I finished this book yesterday. After reading Eclipse I did not expect much (actually, none at all). Still, it is such a disappointment. I did not plan to write this review since it is not worth it. However, I want to warn the Twilight fans (like me) please don't waste your money and time.    After reading an article in TIME magazine about Twilight I got hold of the book and I loved it. I went on with New Moon which is not as good but fine. Eclipse was bad for my taste. Bella totally betrayed her love to Edward by admitting that she actually was in love with Jacob. I do not believe any TURE love could have any space for a third party. Don't get me wrong, I like Jacob. He's warm, witty, and kind. It is not his fault that he fell in love with Bella. It is Bella's attitude towards both Edward and Jacob that upsets me. She already had Edward and she needed more. It would be ok if she simply needs Jacob as best friend and a soul mate. But no, she actually was in love with him. How pathetic!    In Breaking Dawn, it is shocking that Jacob `imprinted' with Bella's daughter. Can you imagine that?!. Not long ago (in Eclipse) Bella was making out with Jacob. And now he's imprinted with her daughter? How sick that is!!! What was the author thinking when she wrote this? I would not mind that Jacob imprinted with Bella's daughter if Ms. Meyer did not write about the whole kissing and `I love you, love you more' scenes in the previous book. It is so disgusting! But hey, who knows, a lot of people seem fine with it (read those 5 start reviews!).     I honestly wish I had stopped reading the rest of the series right after Twilight. That is the only book I love in this whole saga.     A lot of readers blame the publishing industry for the quality of the Twilight Saga going downhill from bad to worst. I agree with them. When Ms. Meyer wrote her first book (Twilight) she had no idea if and when the book would publish. She must have put in one hundred percent effort into her writing. After the Twilight success, who cares, as long as it is Twilight Saga, it will sell.    I sincerely suggest that, Ms Meyer, FIRE your editor/agent. The damages this book brought to you is beyond rescuing. Considering that this book is dedicated to Ms. Meyer's agent, how ironic it is!
031606792X|2.0|(spoilers below)    I started reading the Twilight series last week (literally) and devoured the first three right on time for Breaking Dawn. And this is what I get? The virtuous innocence of Bella and Edward were completely eradicated just a few chapters in, and then it just got worse. When did our little virgins become sex-crazed masochists? The only redeeming parts were the section from Jacob's point of view, which unfortunately never developed much after that, the first experiences of Bella as a vampire, and then how quickly the book was over. The entire thing was too convenient and too ridiculous like, as has been said over and over again in the reviews, bad fanfiction. Even with a healthy dose of imagination it's too much to swallow. It all seemed like a cheap way out to give everyone what they wanted. It was a fairytale ending, I suppose you could say, but the first three books didn't develop so they could conclude that neatly. They all (Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse) clearly illustrated sacrifice and love. Maybe that's what this book is about then... just have faith and it will all work out perfectly. Unfortunately, life just isn't like that... unless you have vampire venom.
031606792X|5.0|I loved this book it was a great way to wrap up the twilight series. This book had several twists that I didn't see coming at all. Several people have been saying that SM tried too hard to end the series on a happy note, and as a result the plot suffered. While the story did end on a happy note, the plot didn't suffer. This was a great book and a great way to end the series.
031606792X|1.0|As a Twilight fan, I've adored the past three books and looked forward to Breaking Dawn with giddy anticipation.    Then it arrived.    The plot was full of holes, what little of it there was, and overall came off sounding like a bad romance novel or something written by a naive, lovesick thirteen-year-old. I was left with a bad taste in my mouth and a heavy heart.    [[ASIN:031606792X Breaking Dawn (The Twilight Saga, Book 4)]]
031606792X|1.0|I enjoyed this series because it was an entertaining read, and it wasn't filled with sex and poor morality.  I was looking forward to Bella discovering herself, her loves, her dreams, her life goals.  This wasn't written as well as the other books and seemed rushed.  I'm not surprised there are so many poor reviews.<br /><br />Spoiler alert:<br />In the end, I was hoping the character of Bella would grow up and realize she could work for her happiness.  Instead, everything is easy and perfect.  Any mother would know that isn't the truth.  It would be super nice to have a baby tell you what she needs rather than crying and a family to babysit all the time so you get a chance to shag right after having a baby becuase recovery is so easy.
1401216676|5.0|My first ever comic.  I loved it.  Fell in love with it when I sat down in the book store to read it.  I highly recommend it.
0143039504|5.0|The Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition of the Complete Novels of Jane Austen is a high quality paperback reprint of the hardbound Gramercy Classics edition held by many libraries - same good, clear typeface, same charming 1880's era illustrations.  This is a large, well-made paperback that will stand up to many readings.  It's pleasant to hold, with the lovely detail of rough-cut pages.  They're all here:  Elinor, that blighter Willoughby, Mr. Darcy, Emma, and the estimable Captain Wentworth, along with every other character Jane Austen dreamed up. Truly, it's a delightful edition.
031606792X|4.0|I could hardly put this sucker down.  I loved it so much, at times I wanted to scream.    Granted, I had no expectations upon opening this book.  I was simply just ready to be entertained by another vampire story and epic romance.  So I was not disappointed.     It's difficult to end a bestselling series like this one, and please all your readers in the process.  Unfortunately, it seems as though many readers are displeased.    I enjoyed this book, more than I enjoyed any of the others.  The creativity, the imagination that went into this plotline is incredible to me.  Every twist and turn on the road to the end of this saga was completely unexpected to me, but the storyline seemed to fit together perfectly like a jigsaw puzzle.  Complete, beautiful, and ready for framing.    Many people are unhappy with the ending, but I highly suggest you read it and decide for yourself.      You might just fall in love with it.
031606792X|5.0|I have read this twice now, I think it has to be done that way to really appreciate it. The first time around was a shock to the system, so reading it a second time I really appreciated it all the more, and I was able to catch things that I was too distracted to catch the first time around.<br />I would definitely say that it doesn't follow the same path as the other three books but it's still a good read that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.
B000TLMWMY|5.0|I am watching this video series for the second time and enjoying it even more.It is wonderful to see so many old favorite musical talents in one place. It is a classic treasure of Johnny's compilation and courage to put all of this out for the public enjoyment,love and education.The DVDs are well done and good quality. I'm giving another set to my sister for Christmas.:-)
031606792X|5.0|A lot of people are giving this a bad review. But they're complaining about ridiculous things. About how Bella and Edward are not so desperate now, that Jacob's action is creepy, and that they hated it.<br /><br />Something you people don't understand is that everyone grows up, and to have characters do that is very hard. Another thing is Stephenie was very good at something I'm very serious about. Once *SPOILER* Bella is changed, she loses her humanity to an extent. And now there's no one who has humanity in the story. And she did it very well.<br /><br />I loved Breaking Dawn. But go into it with no expectations. Let the story reveal itself and remeber what Stephenie says. Don't write for your audience, write for yourself. And that's what she did.
031606792X|4.0|I have to say that I'm astonished at all the bad reviews of this book. I think it was exactly what the ending of the series needed to be. It's a story for young adults and people were obviously expecting too much if they didn't like it. It's fantasy and romance and, most of all, for teenage girls. Of course Bella's going to get everything she wants--it's what nearly every girl would want to see. And I love the deviation from Bella to Jacob and back again because it tells a part of the story that we as readers need to know, but wouldn't get to see through Bella's eyes because of her situation. Stephenie Meyer remains true to her characters throughout the entire novel and gave me so many ups and downs that my nails are now bitten to the quick. It was a fine book for exactly what it was supposed to be. It was thoroughly enjoyable and kept me riveted.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|It is a pleasure to see a intelligent and entertaining paranormal show on t.v.  The big screen has long been the only place to enjoy a true shiver of fright.  I do not include the slasher genre in true horror or the paranormal.  The last good show for this on t.v. was the Xfiles and the last season  of that show was beginning to push even my endurance.          Padaleckie and Ackles are young and beginning to mature in their art.  It has been an absolute wonder to watch the relationship between these \\"brothers\\" grow over the last 3 years.  The awkwardness between them in the first season made the long estrangement between Sam and his brother and father believable.         The many different types of \\"monsters, witches, gods and demons\\" are made all the more believable because the viewer can go to the internet and look up these beings for themselves.  The writers have obviously done the research and most of the details are accurate.  This just makes it more fun to watch.        I am looking forward to the 4th season with much anticipation.  Keep the great shows coming.
B0018O4YSQ|4.0|\\"Dark City\\" was ahead of its time a year to be precise. Examining many of the same themes (an example of simultaneous evolution of ideas, themes and \\"the look\\")as \\"The Matrix\\" (with a somewhat different mystery/plot at its core although ironically \\"The Matrix\\" used some of the same sets) Alex Proyas' \\"Dark City\\" looks at the nature of memory and its definition of our humanity.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks quite good although there is an overuse of Digital Noise Reduction to eliminate the film grain (something that is an important part of the \\"look\\" of the film as much as the color scheme is for \\"The Matrix\\"), the images are crisper with a great deal more detail than on the previous DVD (having seen a DVD rental copy for comparison the DVD looks quite good as well) but some fine detail does occasionally get lost in some of the darker noir influenced sequences of the film due to the overuse of DNR. Still, it is a step up from the previous DVD edition which looked quite good for its time. It doesn't look as bad as \\"Patton\\" (where complexions had a waxy, pasty sheen to them and, again, fine detail in the faces were often lost)but looks better than some digitally overprocessed films. The Blu-ray has both editions of the film--the original theatrical cut and Director's Cut of the film both subjected to DNR to about the same degree,while the DVD has ONLY the \\"Director's Cut\\" of the film. It's a pity because the original DVD certainly is in need of a decent upgrade.<br /><br />Audio sounds terrific.Both the DVD and Blu-ray editions come with a Digital \\"bonus\\" copy of the film that is Windows compatible. Unless you watch it a lot on your PC, you may pull it out once or maybe twice. It is NOT compatible with Apple or ipod devices however.<br /><br />This new edition ports over almost all the original special features from the DVD including the commentary tracks plus adds additional ones as well.  Some special features are in 480i while some others are in 1080p and these include a new documentary \\"Memories of Shell Beach\\", \\"Architecture of Dreams\\", a production gallery, introduction by Director Proyas and the film's champion film critic Roger Ebert (from a 2005 video interview for this edition), text essays, a review of the film by Neil Gaiman and a \\"Director's Cut Fact Track\\" that is a pop-up trivia text extra that notes differences in the \\"Director's Cut\\" vs. the theatrical version of the film, various subtle changes, etc.<br /><br />As to whether you like the \\"Director's Cut\\" or the original theatrical cut that depends on you. I personally preferred the DC because it adds footage (including some alternate angles of shots that Proyas prefers)while subtracting the distracting narration that Keifer Sutherland had to read (it was forced on Proyas by New Line and he never liked it feeling it gave away too much of the plot of the film and was somewhat like the \\"Blade Runner\\" narration--it's not THAT bad but it doesn't add to the enjoyment of the film for me). We get the original theatrical trailer as well.<br /><br />For those who HAVEN'T seen the film a synposis of the plot: John Murdoch (Rufus Swell)awakens in the bath to find two things--1) He doesn't know who he is and a trio of mysterious people are after him 2) there is the body of a prostitute in his hotel room who is the latest victim of a serial killer. He has no memory of having committed the murder nor does he know who he is or why he's there. Murdoch must complete the puzzle of his what happened, figure out who he is before a detective (Willim Hurt)catches him and figure out how the wife he has never seen before (Jennifer Connelly)figures in this mystery. His only guide aside from the clues he can find is a mysterious doctor (Keifer Sutherland)who claims to know who he is, how he lost his memory and that he is involved in some bold, bizarre experiment.<br /><br />Regardless of which version of the film you like, \\"Dark City\\" is well worth seeing as it prefigures \\"The Matrix\\" a over a year. While it didn't catch on at the box office the same way, it did earn critical raves including Roger Ebert naming it the Best Film of 1998.<br /><br />Film- 4 stars<br />Video-3 stars (Too much Digital Noise Reduction used to eliminate film grain)<br />Audio-4 1/2 stars<br /><br />Overall--a terrific film gets its due even if the video isn't perfect it looks stunning at times (although there is a signficant amount of edge enhancement througout the film to compensate for the DNR).<br /><br />Great extras from New Line.<br /><br />Recommended.ox office the same way, it did earn critical raves including Roger Ebert naming it the Best Film of 1998.

B000YAA68W|5.0|This is an animated film based on a true story of a young woman growing up in post-Shah Iran. It is absolutely brilliantly done--the story, the animation, everything.  There is bonus material on the DVD where the author can be seen making the movie and telling some back stories about her life.      It is emotionally powerful as it desribes how she does not fit into society--neither her own in Iran, nor anywhere in Europe where she is sent to live and go to school for her own safety.  The political situation in Iran is clearly described and we get  a real sense of what it must have been like to live in that society. We see innocent people murdered on whims, others hiding their social lives, and all doing their best to survive various religious regimes.    The author's own personal struggle is heart breaking and it is wonderful to know that she eventually found direction in her life, culminating in her success in creating this movie.  Very deserving of the Oscar.
031606792X|5.0|I don't get it....    How come Jacob imprinting on Nessie is gross but when another werewolf did it, then it was ok. I think most people had a perceived view of who was ending with who Edward/Bella, Jacob/Leah and are really just drunk it didn't happen like that.    I mean everyone is saying it isn't about shipping but the only thing people seemed annoyed at is the fact Jacob imprinted on Nessie and the fact she is a baby. If it was any other werewolf would you be so against it?? NO I doubt it because it has ALREADY happened and you all didn't give 2 hoots.    I think it is a brilliant ending to the book. As for SMeyer shutting down Jacob/Bella like that...Where has that person been for the past how many years. SMeyer said from the BEGINNING it would end Jacob/Bella, so why get all angry about it. Jacob will always be her best friend. I knew there were still people out there hoping for a Bella/Jacob ending...and people said most accepted it.    As for Bella going crazy about keeping the baby alive after nearly dying. If you have never been pregnant you wouldn't understand what she was trying to do. ANY mother to be will tell you they would do ANYTHING they could to keep there child alive, even some would be more worried and fanatical about it after nearly dying. So I don't think it was out of character for Bella to be like that.    Obviously being pregnant with my 2nd child I know a lot more then the majority but I am sure you ask any mother or mother to be about it. If you know someone who had trouble falling pregnant or had accepted that they would never have kids, then they fall pregnant. They would be absolutely fanatical about keeping that child alive.    Anyways I loved the book and I really think most people don't like the ending because it doesn't end Leah/Jacob and the fact he imprints on a baby, which has happened before and no one gave 2 hoots about.    GOOD WORK SM..
031606792X|5.0|SPOILERS~I got the book yesterday and couldn't put it down.  I went to Amazon to write my review and saw the book only had an average rating of 3.  I was disappointed, but not shocked.  I knew so many people would take offense at the unexpected twist of Bella's pregnancy.  So please ignore all of the reviews~good or bad.  If you've read all three books then read this one.  Read it w/out people's judgments and prejudices tainting your perspective.  As for me...After I got over my surprise I loved it.  I love when a book surprises me~it rarely happens anymore.  I thought Stephanie Meyer did a fantastic job with the plot line and disagree w/the reviewers that think she is sending a wrong message.  I'm 26, never married, and have no kids.  I'm all for women's independence.   Not once did I feel the book was telling teens to get married young and have babies.  Everyone is different, with different wants and desires.  Bella always felt on the outside.  It was nice to see her come into her own.  As they have been hinting since book one~Bella was always meant to be a vampire.  I'm ready the read the series again!
0590402331|3.0|I really wanted this book to catch on with my two sons during our bedtime reading. I liked the concept of showing that one action creates another and another. However, the book didn't work and here's why:<br /><br />1. The narrator doesn't have a voice. Put this against [[ASIN:0394800168 Green Eggs and Ham]] where you've got two distinct voices playing off each other or [[ASIN:037582913X Monster at the End of this Book]] where Grover's voice goes from whisper to yelling and finally back down to a whimper. This book doesn't help bedtime readers. I might as well have read a motorcycle manual.<br /><br />2. The story wears on you just as the mouse wears on the boy. I thought it was telling that near the end of the book, the boy in the story falls asleep in a rocking chair. The actions didn't get sillier or funnier or more intesting; there was just one right after another.<br /><br />3. What the mouse does beyond eating a cookie isn't neither creative nor interesting. For a small character in a big world, choose instead the classic \\"Jack in the Beanstalk\\" or a mouse with character, [[ASIN:0060263954 Stuart Little.]]<br /><br />In summary, I give it 3 out of 5 stars. This makes a fair early reader book but your children will quickly leave it behind for more engaging stories.
031606792X|5.0|Breaking Dawn is a brilliant book about the power of love.  It is a real faery tale, not the Disney version, that includes the otherness and darkness present in the brothers Grimm. Bella's new life has beauty and wonder, but an alieness that we could not have anticipated before, disturbing and compelling. Transitions are often so.  This is fundamentally a book about the power of love. It is nothing short of love that can accomplish what happens in this story. It reminds us that love between two people, of parents for children, of the family, of truth and goodness is a force we should never underestimate.  It is a surprising book, not what I expected and not completely comfortable. It may not be the book you expected but leave your mind open  and let the story tell itself. You may learn more than you imagined.
0061537934|5.0|I have just read the last sentence of this amazing book. Through a     veil of tears I might add.   Thank you for one of the best books I have read in a long time.   I might add this is the first time I have ever written a \\"Fan\\" letter or a review for a book.
031606792X|1.0|First off, S.Meyer definitely shouldn't have introduced such a big unrealistic conflict (the baby) into her last book. It takes place for half of the book. I agree with her on focusing on Jacob and everything especially since many people wanted a happy ending, but his \\"happy ending\\" shouldn't have related to bella again. Also, she should have focused more on edward and bella since in eclipse bella chose edward. However, in BD she focuses mainly on Jacob and on the baby which is just boring. I mean, what else is there to the fact that the baby is killing her. Enough already.    Also, in the end, Bella of course gets everything she wants and lives happily ever after. Great. so sappy. so unrealistic.
031606792X|5.0|I loved this book.  Most of it was so unexpected.  I literally had to stop and walk around to grasp what was happening at times-that is a really great thing.  I thought it was brilliant and creative.  Extremely satisfying and leaves me imagining their futures.    Enjoy the ride!  It's great!
031606792X|1.0|I'm not going to repeat what lots of reviewers have already said before me, but this book was dissapointing. I had problems with the first three books but overall, I liked them and was looking forward to the last book.  It was terrible! The stuff that happens is ridiculous and it reads like the worst fanfiction plots all stuffed in one book. And maybe, just maybe, I would have given the book two stars if at least Jacob had imprinted on a beautiful stranger or someone, ANYONE else than Bella's daughter. I don't even know what to say about that. Jacob was my favorite character in this series, and I had hoped that in BD he would finally detach himself from Bella and begin his own life, but noooo, he is STILL somehow connected to Bella.  Also, I hate how Rosalie and Esme were both denied having children but Bella gets one. UGH.   Anyway, I wish I could just forget this book ever existed and pretend Eclipse is the last book in the series.
031606792X|5.0|I truly loved this book and all of the books in the Twilight Saga.  I have been obsessing over the characters like they are real people.  I was so anxious when I got my copy of Breaking Dawn, that I literally had a stomach ache, wondering if Bella and Edward would be able to be happy for eternity.  I confess, I even had to read ahead to make sure they were ok, just so I could get some sleep.  I am with Stephenie Meyer. . .in today's day and age, sometimes you just need a perfect love story with a perfectly happy ending.
B000062X90|5.0|This album won awards in the UK for it's production when it was originally released on vinyl. The sound is great and the playing even greater!  Not only was it WA's finest, but possibly won of the best rock albums of all time!
031606792X|2.0|I was so excited for this book and I kept waiting and waiting for it to get better or for it to pick up, that never happened. It feels like Meyer took the easy way out on this and rushed the book to end when the iron was still hot. The first three were great books I was not disappointed, however this one falls so very flat. The things that annoyed me most was Jacob and Charlie's fates. And even Bella's I understand that she comes into her own but it's so rushed and she has all this power and it feels like Meyer understood that so many fans loved Jacob that to keep him around she threw in that crazy love for him just to keep him in Bella's life. Overall maybe this should have been a first draft not the ones fans deserve. Not to compare but Harry Potter took eleven years and it was worth the wait and people were still interested years after the first, maybe a little while longer would have helped this book.
031606792X|1.0|There are so many good writers out there.  People who know how to work the craft and make it amazing.  Stephanie Meyer is NOT one of them.  Yet another HACK writer that had a decent idea to begin with but got entirely too famous in order to sustain it.  Sound familiar?  Oh yes!  Just. Like. JKR.<br /><br />Go take some classes Stephanie.  This book was your worst.<br /><br />The plot ran too fast, the change in POV was disgusting and boring and the never ending ITALIC THOUGHTS was retarded.  And baby speak?  BABY SPEAK?!  YOU ACTUALLY WROTE PHONETIC BABY SPEAK?!?!<br /><br />You have utterly lost your mind.<br /><br />I think I liked Half Blood Prince better than this and I absolutely hated, loathed and despised that book.
031606792X|3.0|Stephanie Meyer is much better than this...  Not that it's intensely horrible but just a little on the happy-Disney-movie-ending side.  There were extremely hot scenes that made my hands literally tremble...and some scenes that I wish never existed.  The solution to the whole Jacob vs Edward issue seemed a little too neat and the lack of violence near the end made all the built up tension seem like a waste of energy.  In the end, you're probably going to ask, \\"Is that IT?\\"          But this book was awesome.  I love Stephanie Meyer and I don't hate her for writing this; it's her series anyway.  Besides, once she learns of all the terrible reviews she's getting she'll be bound to write even more awesome books in the future.  A sequel to The Host, hopefully.        Was it worth waiting in line at 12 midnight?  Kind of.  Is it worth $12.64 on amazon?  Definitely.
031606792X|3.0|First, I can (to a degree) understand the frantic worry that seems to be bothering some of the readers on here about how Bella's detour from reality might negatively influence some of the more impressionable readers of this series. However, I think that most teenage girls (or boys, not to be prejudice) can decipher the difference between the over-the-top fantasy that this book is and what real life entails. Sure, Bella doesn't end up a feminist hero or gain any real insight or depth in this book-but why would anyone expect her to? Although I waited during the course of the other three books for Meyer to play up what could have been some very interesting and movingly literary character dilemmas, all the opportunities that I saw for character/story development were passed blithely by as the characters in the books face minor (on a vampire scale) challenges, but then ultimately end up the exact same people in the exact same situations by the end of their lengthy adventures. Why would the finale be any different?     I enjoyed this book because I took it at face value. I did not expect true depth, and I was not disappointed. While it might not be the most creative or thought-provoking ending, as far as teen-vampire-romance novels go, this entire series has been well-articulated and provides better reads than 99% of other books marketed towards readers of this demographic. I hope that some of the more vicious attacks on the book won't deter Mrs. Meyer from furthering her writing career.

031606792X|5.0|To start ***SPOILERS***. (I don't know if that is needed because I've never written a review here before but felt the need to speak up on seeing the negativity.)    I've been a fan of these books for the past year- not an obsessive one, although I may have done a happy dance at seeing the movie trailer. I did read the series through twice and was eagerly anticipating the conclusion.  I even did the midnight thing (even though I'm, oh, a skosh older than the average fan).    Before reading anyone else's opinion, I loved the book.  On further examination, I may have a FEW regrets with the extremely happy conclusion, but not nearly enough to take away from my total blissed-out read. I thought I knew where this was going about a hundred pages in and was weary at the thought of 600 pages worth of Bella flip-flopping over her fate and ending up playing the martyr and selflessly staying human to give birth while Edward died valiantly to save Bella and his child during some sort of siege. Frankly, I was mad.  So, I was surprised by the gutsy choices Meyer made and thought this was a great read.  Anyone who thinks that Bella didn't make any sacrifices must have skimmed the second third of the book- even if it isn't told through her eyes, I think we see our heroine MORE than earn her happy ending.      I loved it.  It's worth the purchase, make your own decisions.  And for heavens sake steer clear of spoilers, because I'd probably have run for the hills if I'd gotten the plot of this book in a paragraph or two- I went in spoiler-free.  If you're reading this, you already love these people.  Spend a little more time with them, because even if the more dramatic plot twists throw you off, the dialogue is still completely right- just read Bella's reaction to Jacob's nickname for her daugher and you'll KNOW it's still her. (Great scene.)    Lastly, if I could deduct a quarter of a star for the name Renesmee, I would.  Someone please tell me how to pronounce this so it doesn't sound awkward.  I would have voted for 'Carlie Renesmee'.  Not that big a leap.
031606792X|1.0|Why? Why did I have to waste so much of my time on this series? That would have never been the case if I would have known It would end on such a sour, poorly written note.
B0017I1FNK|5.0|It sure is good to have another album by Emmylou Harris, and this one shows the depth of experience.  We're enjoying it!
B001CXW8CW|5.0|This movie blew the top off of comic adaptations. The action is up there with the best, as are the effects. All of the lead actors make their roles utterly convincing, and that take a lot when so many people push the edge all at once.<br /><br />Heath Ledger's \\"Joker\\" character convinced me. I've known smart people, and lost people, and some who were both. Nicholson's \\"Joker\\" projected vicious insanity outward. Ledger's projected it inward. Even his flaking facepaint worked to convey what lay within, the way that ivy, lichens, and crumbling mortar convey what lies inside a ruin.<br /><br />Bale's \\"Batman\\" goes out on Ledger's limb with him. Batman retains enough sanity left to know that people need sanity; Ledger's \\"Joker\\" has spiralled in on himself, so that nothing remains for human contact. Somehow the Joker recruits cronies, despite their remarkably short working lives.<br /><br />In the end, they sit around discussing what all other the citizens of the city ought to be allowed to know - the six (or so) deciding for the six million (or so). If the road to hell is paved with good intentions, these guys have a fleet of trucks standing by to pave it for you.<br /><br />It's not for young kids. If you take your tweener or young teen, have a long talk after. Back in the day, good guys won, bad guys lost, and we all went home knowing who was who. That day is gone, and good riddance. Today, people need to think, even after a superhero/action flick. Is that so bad?<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the theatrical release
031606792X|5.0|Breaking Dawn was truly a mixed bag of a book for me. There were some things I really liked, but some things that really annoyed me. One of the plot lines sounded like an ill conceived fanfiction I had read, while other plot lines left open from Eclipse were conveniently resolved with little to no problems. The book was separated into three books, two of them narrated by Bella and the middle one narrated by Jacob. I was hoping for an Edward book, but I guess I'll have to wait for Midnight Sun for that. Jacob is not my favorite character, so reading through his mood swings and craziness was a little painful for me. Another problem was that the insights into characters that were commonplace in the first three books are pretty much absent in this one. The literary allusions (also a characteristic of the previous books) weren't as involved as in the past.    Despite its obvious flaws, I was riveted. I bought the book at a midnight release party and had to sit and read until I was finished. That is a staple of a good book. I went from being happy to sad to outraged (to the point of yelling at the book) and back. I was on the edge of my seat for much of the novel. I deeply care about what happens to these characters and I wasn't disappointed. My favorite scenes are in the last third of the book, including the face off with the Volturi. Even if many of us thought at one point or another in the novel, \\"Stephenie, what were you thinking?\\", this book was a great conclusion to an awesome saga.
B001CD6FKI|4.0|If you think that Anime is just starting to hit major popularity, think again! Back in the 1950s and 1960s, while there wasn't much of a selection there were three huge Anime titles that were extremly popular. Astro Boy, Kimba The White Lion and of course the hero with the extremly catchy theme song...Speed Racer. Speed Racer is an extreme race car driver with a heart of gold. He wants to prove that racing is not about money or power it is about loving what you do. So now Speed Racer has become a live action movie unlike anything that has ever graced the big screen.<br /><br />This movie promised to be either the biggest success of the Summer 2008 line up or the biggest bust. Unfortunatly I had a feeling it was going to fall into the bust catagory. The Wachowski Bros., directing already put up a major red flag because of all those people who hated how the Matrix saga ended. Still after seeing the trailers for this movie and knowing how the series was played out I still had high hopes for a good time in the theater. I went to see and I got exactly what I wanted. Speed Racer was just as goofy and funny with the rambling diologue the corny 60ish jokes and put on screen to be a live action anime. The special effects and cinemetography blew me away. After seeing Sin City and 300 it was amazing to see the same style of filming with wide open spaces and extremly colorful layouts. The soundtrack also kept that 1960's feel to it. All and all eventhough this film is over 2 hours long. You will only appreciate this movie if you know exactly what you are getting into. I knew what I wanted and it was worth every penny.
031606792X|2.0|I will freely admit to loving the first three books, but as for Breaking Dawn, all I can say is WTF????? I eagerly waited at Barnes and Noble to get my copy at MN and rushed home to read it. After the perfect wedding and start of a great honeymoon, my bliss dissolved into numb disappointment and anger. How is Bella pregnant? What kind of name is Reneesmee Carlie? What next Rosalice or her brother Jasemmett??           I just felt the whole time that I read this book that it was a different author writing this [..]. The characters felt different, like it was a new Bella and Edward. Stephenie Meyer wouldn't destroy her characters like this. She wouldn't have Jacob IMPRINT on a BABY!!!!        The book was saturated with plot that made little sense. Would Alice really leave without saying why? Could we cram another vampire with a screwed up name in the story? So many new characters with no reason to care about them. The climax with the Volturi was anticlimactic which was a letdown. We have been so worried about how the Volturi were going to interfere with Bella and Edward and we got that? No one died, not that I wanted to lose anyone, but that's not realistic. Characters die, as we all know.      As far as I'm concerned, Eclipse was the end. I will imagine their REAL happily ever after. Well, SM you had a good career until now. I hope it was worth it to destroy your characters.             Is the Twilight movie gonna suck too?
031606792X|4.0|I was Bella in a sense. I was young when I married and it resulted in being a young mother. I see a lot of complaints that Bella wouldn't have maternal instincts, yet they come to you often after you have a baby. As for feeling the urge to have the baby the second you know about it, that's something I can believe too. Once you feel life within you, there is no other feeling quite like it. I was not an enormous fan of the book, but I can see SM's reasoning behind a lot of things.     First of all: The name Nessie...don't you guys get it? Another MONSTER...it's actually very clever.     Secondly: I believe that Jacob imprinting on Nessie was a good choice because I don't believe that he ever could have left Bella, no matter the cost. I think that by including him in this way it kind of wrapped it all up nicely where nobody had to suffer greatly.    Thirdly: As for the theme of sacrifice that people seem to think is missing, an entire group of people are willing to sacrifice themselves for one baby. There is no greater love than that of a child and to have that many people involved in protecting said child is an amazing thing.     All that being said, I think it could have been a better book but it wasn't as horrible as people are making it out to be. I think a lot of it depends on your view of the world and life experiences to really understand the dynamics of the book. Open your minds and read it a few times and I think it will grow on you.
031606792X|5.0|First of all, I think that giving this book one star should be criminal.<br /><br />This story is fiction people!<br /><br />No one expects everything to turn out ok in real life, this story is well written because it has imagination, drama, humor, passion, and makes the reader want to believe in the fairy tale.<br /><br />I loved this book more than all the others because it weaves together many loose ends. Having Bella get more than she could ever hope for is great, and a display of peace and harmony is exactly what people in this world need.<br /><br />There were shocking events in this story which made it that much more entertaining to read. And if the story had ended any other way it would have set the stage for yet another book, and Meyer should focus on Edwards side of the story!!!! (a.k.a midnight sun).<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend the book, as long as you suspend reality while reading, in order to enjoy it to the fullest! It is young adult FICTION anyway. :)
031606792X|3.0|***SPOILERS WILL BE IN THIS REVIEW***    I've read a ton of the negative reviews, and they all say basically the same thing.  That there is no sacrifice, and everything conveniently falls into Bella's lap.  This is absolutely true, but are these reactions justified?    I wish I had a picture of my face when I figured out Bella was pregnant.  I'm sure it was absolute misery and horror.  While I completely disagreed with this direction, and Bella's immediate reaction, there were some points to this decision that cannot be overlooked.  Edward did struggle, but stood by his wife's decision to keep the child.  I would like to point out HER decision, because she is a woman, it is her body.  Bella also gained some level of maturity because of this, which one thing she has always been lacking in.  Do I think it was the right way to go, not really.  I soldiered on, even though I had a deep desire to stop.      I loved Jacob's section.  You could tell the ease that Stephanie has writing this character, it isn't as forced as Bella.  Did I like the fact that he imprinted on her child, not really, but I knew he was going to imprint on someone.  Bella would have been off the hook the second Jacob imprinted anyway, so the object--while messed up--doesn't really matter.    The overall writing in this book was the best out of the four.  Bella's changes in this book were constant and fitting for the time.  Her teenage insecurities seemed to vanish and she became a woman, which is a natural if not necessary progression for Bella's character.  While Bella's choices may not have been the ones you would make; you have not been courted by a vampire.  Her choices are going to be different given the circumstances.    I began to enjoy the book much more once I separated myself from all these stigmas I was putting on the author, and that most of you have.  \\"This doesn't set a good example for teenage girls,\\" \\"Life isn't like this,\\" you get the point.  The truth is, it isn't the author's responsibility to impose moral values and life lessons on their readers (thought I think overall Meyer did an excellent job).  This book is a work of fiction, meant to entertain.  Enlightenment, life lessons, etc are good things to put in literature, but since when are they a requirement?  If you don't want to instill these silly, and irresponsible ideas in your child's head then don't let them read it.  It isn't Stephenie Meyer's responsibility to instill values and life lessons upon the youth of America (Bella was married before having sex, that is a good thing).  Don't fool yourself into thinking that girls don't want the fantasy, otherwise why would Disney movies be so popular?  Let them have their fantasy world while they can, they will grow up someday.  Stephenie Meyer simply provided what everyone wanted, it was the curve balls she thew at you along the journey that most didn't approve of, including me.     I agree that Bella got off easy, but with everything she has been through don't you think she deserves a little time in the sun?  Read it again, for fun, as entertainment and you might like it a little more.  Let the teenager in you come out and enjoy the fantasy, because the world that we know sucks enough, why not escape for a little while?  If you're unable to do this then do what the entire world did with the Matrix squeals, and simply pretend this book doesn't exist.
031606792X|1.0|The first three books in the Twilight Series have flaws. But I loved them FOR their flaws, not despite them.  The mediocre writing, the bad dialogue, the fact that Edward is (IMHO) a watered down version of Mr. Rochester from one of my favorite books, Jane Eyre.  The questionable message sent to young girls about their own self worth, the near total glossing over of the pitfalls of immortality.  These books are still fun reads, suspenseful plots, decent fight scenes, and I will keep them in case I want to re-read in the future.    Breaking Dawn, is a whole different story.  Besides going back on specific claims that Vampires in her universe are unable to make babies, the author doesn't even really explain the mechanics of it.  I'm left wondering what the hell happened.  And in the end, nothing much.  This book is one big anticlimax.  All that time leading up to the grand battle with the Volturi...and there is no fight, everybody goes home okay.  All that time spend wondering what will happen when Renesmee (OMG that name) grows up too fast... and nothing happens.  Turns out she's going to live forever.  All that loooong, draaawn out time wondering what's going to happen with the vampire/werewolf/human love triangle and....Jacob inprints on Bella and Edward's creepy spawn instead of being allowed to live and grow away from Bella naturally and realistically.  All that time wondering about Bella's vampire power and it turns out to be a Lily Potter-esque \\"love shield\\".  Cop out after cop out after cop out.    Now for the good, the reason this book actually deserves one star instead of zero:  Jacob's book.  Despite my not liking Jacob in any of the previous books, I sympathized with him in this one, and found myself really interested in what was going on with the werewolves.    To sum up:  this book sacrifices all rational and interesting plot lines and ideas to give every single character a \\"happy\\" ending.  I recommend this novel ONLY to those interested in seeing everysingle thing tied up a nice, neat bow.

031606792X|4.0|This book, highly anticipated was absolutely a stunner. The longest book in the Twilight series, this finishes Bella and Edward's story from Bella's perspective.<br /><br />First, Breaking Dawn begins with Bella remembering when she told her father, Charlie about her engagement to Edward Cullen, a vampire. Of course, Charlie has no idea that Edward and his family are vampires, or that his daughter is planning on marrying Edward and becoming a vampire herself. Surprisingly, Charlie isn't too surprised by her announcement.<br /><br />The first 7 chapters are about Bella's wedding and honeymoon to Isle Esme, her new vampire mother-in-law's private island. (Apparently, vampires are very rich, or at least the Cullen family is) Making love with Edward is a problem: he is supernaturally strong, and very afraid he will loose control and hurt her/bite her. Even with those risks, they somehow manage to have a decent honeymoon. Until...<br /><br />Bella starts feeling funny. She is throwing up, having strange food cravings, and her period is 5 days late. But, she's only been honeymooning for 2 weeks, it couldn't be possible that she is pregnant, can it?? Apparently YES, she can be.<br /><br />Now, this is where the story really lost its reality: vampires are DEAD. Having children should NOT be a possibility, but for Bella and Edward, a reality they will have to face, VERY soon. Bella's pregnancy is VERY accelerated, and no one is sure what sort of child she will have, vampire, human, vampire human hybrid??<br /><br />Now the point of view switches to Jacob, Bella's best friend, who is a shape shifting werewolf. He is devastated by Bella's marriage, deeply concerned for her safety while honeymooning, and can't stand the thought of her a)becoming a vampire and b)being with someone besides himself. Now, Jacob and his pack have to make a decision about Bella. The Cullen family promised that they would never bite a human, and if they did, the wolves could hunt them and kill them. Obviously, Bella's situation is NOT something the wolves bargained for: a human WANTING to be willingly bitten.<br /><br />Without spoiling the ending, Twilight fans, this book DOES wrap up the story with Bella and Edward nicely. SHE DOES become a vampire, and its worth reading, my favorite part of the novel. (Last half) There is closure for team Jacob fans as well, the Volturi come into play, and NONE of the Cullen's die.<br /><br />I'd say this was a SHOCKING read, it presented MANY surprises I was not prepared for, and went a very different way than anticipated. Many reviewers have been disappointed with Breaking Dawn, and I think they expected something very different too. I loved the book, after I got used to the idea of Bella getting pregnant. If you ignore how far-fetched that idea is, you'll enjoy the book more.

031606792X|4.0|Yes, the name Renesme is ridiculous, especially to read so many times. Yes, it was all delivered neatly in a brightly wrapped package. But, arent all romance stories like that- and we love those, dont we? I think the main people who hated this book are teenagers who wouldnt understand the contentment of being married and having children would bring. I loved this book, and while I did wish for Bella to become more independent in nature, she has a very long time to do so- we just wont be there to see it. Her love for Edward was always the great love we long for, her love for Jacob was always familial and non-physical. The fact that he imprinted on Renesme was not pedophiliac, it was actually foreshadowed when they highlighted the relationship of his fellow pack-member who imprinted upon a toddler. I am mainly disappointed in everyone's reactions to the book- if you wanted blood and guts, or Bella to leave Edward and break his heart, you've been reading the wrong series.
031606792X|2.0|A formulaic, uninspired ending to a mediocre yet fun series. Mrs. Meyer's conservative beliefs have permeated every word in this book, making it feel more like right-wing propaganda than a young adult goth romance novel.<br /><br />Bella, who until now has been dead-set against marriage (let alone motherhood) takes to marriage like a fish to water, and instead of reacting with a normal amount of shock, she embraces pregnancy at 18 as if it were her lifelong goal. The first three books portrayed Bella as a pragmatic (if needy) teenager who knew domestic bliss wasn't for her; Breaking Dawn nonsensically throws all that out the window.<br /><br />Breaking Dawn is deeply anti-feminist. It insists that all women (no matter what they may think) really just want to be barefoot and pregnant. And even though vampires should be the epitome of sexual equality -- men and women are equally strong -- Meyer can't let that happen, so it turns out that the reason vampires can't procreate is because of the WOMEN. Men are perfectly capable of fertilizing normal, weak women.<br /><br />I thought that the entire series provided a less than perfect example for teen girls given that Bella is obsessed only with guys (and one guy in particular), but it took a real nosedive with Breaking Dawn.
031606792X|1.0|The first 80+ pages were great but I would like to burn and rewrite the rest of the book. I can think of so many way that things could have played out that would have been better. I am embarassed to say that I am a 35 year old military wife and mother of 2, but I was depending on this book to as amazing as the first 3. Where was the romance? Where was the story? I don't know how I am going to get over this disappointment. I needed this book to be great. Why the baby? Why the honeymoon? Why? Why? Why? I wish she killed everyone but Jacob and the baby. At least then I would have a reason to feel devistated!
1592332803|1.0|I could hardly wait for this book to arrive. When it finally did, I couldn't wait to open it up and look inside.  It was then that I was so disappointed!

031606792X|4.0|So our wonderful Twilight world had to come to an end. This isn't what I expected... but that doesn't mean it wasn't good.     I spent the last couple of years thinking of dramatic scenes that could end up in the last book of this series. So when we find out the dramatic big shocker during their honeymoon, I was thinking WHAT?!!! What is THIS??     However, once I got past that and the fact that I wasn't going to get some of the scenes I imagined in my head, I very much enjoyed this last installment of the Twilight series. There was plenty of suspense, plenty of romance, and plenty of happy endings for our main characters we love so much. Everything I wanted to happen to Bella, Edward, and Jacob DID happen... just in a completely different way than I imagined. And that's good, right??? We don't need Ms. Meyer to be predictable for us to love her stories... in fact, I enjoy how different all of her books are.     I enjoyed how she broke it up and wrote a part of the book from Jacob's perspective. The stand off between Jacob and Sam in the woods was powerful and something we would have had to see through Jacob's eyes. I honestly thought there for a while that something might happen between Jacob and Leah...When Jacob imprints on the person he does, I felt bad for her, however it was good to see her get some respect and be put in a position of responsibility in Jacob's pack. It was nice to get inside the wolves heads a bit more and feel like you know them better.     Oh and I loved Bella's 'special power' she ends up with.     I do have reasons why I didn't give this book 5 stars (which I would give to all the others in the Twilight series). First was Alice. I didn't like her character much in this book, and I don't just mean her ruse to make it look like she left the Cullens during their desperate hour (which I don't feel that is a spoiler in any way. Did anyone THINK she really just up and left?) I didn't like her from the point on where Bella was \\"sick.\\" She hid upstairs due to her headaches most of the book, didn't seem very supportive or even passionate or emotional about all the near death experiences Bella was facing at all. I was expecting something more from her. Even an emotional scene where she tries to talk Bella out of what she's doing, anything.     *spoiler* I was a bit hesitant with the baby storyline at first. It ended up okay but when it first came up I was so shocked that this was the direction the story was headed. I wonder if it was a too convienent way to give Bella everything she could possibly want. And I thought it interesting when she states that they all got to stay young and beautiful forever... It didn't feel like the best message...     But other than that, I did very much love this story. **spoilers** I loved watching Bella strong, her vampire powers, loved the arm wrestling match with Emmet, loved the teasing between Emmet and Bella, actually liked Rosalie and Bella becoming closer (despite the wierd way that came about), liked that Jacob got his own happy ending (though I would have liked to see a reaction of Jacob seeing Bella as a vampire for the first time while he was still in love with her). The best part of this entire book is the ending scene between Bella and Edward... it was something I feel all the readers who are invested in these characters will love to read, something we've all wanted Edward to be able to 'see.'
031606792X|2.0|the last 3rd of the book was excellent, because its something we expected, contrasted to the 1st third where we were taken by surpise, I mean suprises are good in books but it just doesn't seem to fit with the last 3 twilight books, and the 2nd third of the book was ok, but it was still different being told by jake's side, so this also made the book seem a bit off, over all its good, but it doesnt fit into the twilight series.
031606792X|5.0|This is a great book! Mature readers will get it, as for young readers - stretch a little. There are no hard fast rules on vampires, whatever the author wants to imbibe the characters with is fair game.     As for imprinting - we learned in a previous book that sometimes it happens with much younger characters and the \\"part human/part wolf' character does not age until that which was imprinted upon reaches the mature age, and then they move forward in age together. This concept while hard for me to grasp when it was first revealed, has been accepted by me within the framework of the story.     SM wrote a great 4th book - thanks Stephenie!
031606792X|5.0|I just finished the book -- it kept me reading right up to the end just like the others.  I understand the surprise (although not really the disappointment) of others.  I felt that I got all of the closure that I needed regarded Bella and Edward and Jacob.  Yes, the imprinting was different, but I found myself laughing and crying all the way through it.  It was so satisfying for Edward and Bella to get their happiness.. isn't that what we all want?  Sometimes we don't get it in real life, but I don't need additional heartbreak when I read.  Getting to experience all of their triumphs after all of their struggles was very satisfying to me.      I also understand where we would all like to have some nice message in there somewhere... but guess what???  They waited until they were married, and their love was strong enough to survive all of the difficulties that came with their marriage and offspring.  Is that not a good enough message for anybody?  I wanted Bella and Edward to be happy, and I got what I wanted.  Now I'm happy!
B0017MO10U|5.0|What a fun and exciting ride!! A \\"classic\\" Stargate SG-1 adventure, with as Cam once said \\"the band together again\\"! Such fun to see th original team all together and the enhancement the addition of Cam and Vala are to that group. Loved watching RDA interact with his old friends again.    The acting is great, the Arctic scenes are jaw-dropping, Brad Wright is at his finest with the script and Martin Wood is magnificent behind the camera as the director.    Don't miss this one folks!
031606792X|4.0|I will admit that the book isn't perfect, but it is a nice ending to the saga.  Does it have flaws? Yes.  Could it have been better? Yes. But if you read it for the enjoyment alone, forgetting any fanfiction you may have read or any preconceived notions of what \\"Should\\" happen, it is an enjoyable read.    Its is mythological fiction, after all, and as such, Stephenie took liberties with the qualities that her characters have in their lives.  Fine. Its her story and she has that right.     I went into this book wanting two things - that Bella & Edward get married and that she is changed into a vampire.  I got both.  So I'm satisfied with that.      New characters are introduced, and while I would love to learn more about them, I understand why more exposition wasn't done on them.  Things are shaken up quite a bit for our favorite Vampire family, and everything does have a conclusion.  Even Bella's family is wrapped up in the ending.     Is it unrealistic?  Absolutely - -that's why its fantasy.      But if you don't put so much stock in \\"what it should be\\" and just read it for the fun of it, you will enjoy it.
031606792X|3.0|SPOILER ALERT!!!<br /><br />Okay, that out of the way. I just finished the book, and I have to say I was pretty absorbed with the story, the way I was for the first three in the saga.  Like those three, I'm not entirely sure why I was so sucked in.  The best I can figure is that they are sort romance novels--where I read them, knowing full well how everything was going to turn out, but just to see how it gets there.<br /><br />The book definately takes a leap into PG-13 land with Bella and Edward fully consumating their relationship.  While Meyer doesn't going into lots of detail in the many, many lurv scenes, she does a really good job of making the sexual tension and desire steam up the reading glasses.<br /><br />In a way I feel like this book got too big, situationally, for the original story line. Eh, Voluturi...other crazy international vampires, dominating the plot, taking time away from the characters we've spent thousands of pages caring about.  I'm mean, yay! some of these characters are a lot of fun, but it was a little overwhelming and slightly tedious, I almost feel that she should have broken this into two books somehow, really given the characters more room to breathe.<br /><br />I definately am dissapointed Bella's child naming skills too. Poor freakish child gets a freakish name, good thing Reneesme will never have to go to a school playground.  And yeah....Jacob as the son-in-law of Bella and Edward, ewwie.<br /><br />And I feel for several hundred year old genius vampire doc--shouldn't Carlise have figured out that a vamp/human hybrid fetus might want something other than IV fluid a little sooner?? I did.<br /><br />I still think this is a good read for what it is, but I've never held these books on a pedestal.  They are just good escapism and the best for of that usually has a happy ending, even if was rather contrived.
B0010AN7Z4|5.0|It SHOULD be sufficient to report that Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine feature in this superb classic movie.    These two superb actors, carry this brilliant story and script along, effortlessly. Supporting cast members also contribute although to be honest I, personally, have never liked Fred McMurray in 'bad guy' roles.  This doesn't detract from his acting ability, though.    This is a super movie and there must, in all honesty, be something wrong with anyone who doesn't find it a rattling good tale - brilliantly acted and Directed throughout.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|After the opening party scene you know where this film is going.  It goes nowhere!  It's not to say the idea isn't a good one and often humorous instead it is one unbelievable scene after another with a few corn ball flashbacks (We were so happy and had lots of fun). Perhaps if the film slowed down to give insight into the plot or even the characters we might even care about these lost party souls. Are they real actors or were they just scooped up off Sunset! The best part was the endless battery life of the video camera with video light capability no less. Who doesn't want to do video when a city is surrounded by death and destruction just one nerdy character who claims to know nothing about video anyway. Best line \\"Will you put that camera down and help me\\" Where did they come up with those crab creatures? And of course they (crab creatures) were also in the subway. Surprised? The special effects were not special and the sets must have been built in the studio. Not much looked like it was on location. If you're a sci-fi fan check it out. If your a student of film check it out too but when you imitate this technique try to do better. This is too easy!
031606792X|5.0|Without giving too much away, I enjoyed the book.  The resolution for ALL of the characters was a bit too perfect, but then again, Mrs. Meyer DID say that she wanted her Happily Ever After....    Good news is, it leaves it slightly open-ended.  There could be another book in the future, dealing with the characters' future selves.      Many younger readers may not like this book, as it is not as dramatic as some of the earlier ones, and deals with more mature subjects and ideals.  It's probably better for the older ones, like the Twilight Moms, as it deals with a lot of parental issues.
031606792X|2.0|This book could have done without all of the sex between Bella and Edward (wasted time), especially Edward asking Jacob to create a child with her and Jacob imprinting on Nessie.(The name Reneesme was terrible).  Stephenie went too far in creating a way for Jacob to be with Bella forever.  It was like she wanted to appease all of the fans' wishes so she crammed as much in as possible which just left me with a bad taste in my mouth for the book.
B001C08RHA|5.0|Wow, this film rocks, it's up their with Spider Man II as the best of the Marvel films.  Downey is great as Stark, he's all charisma and steel will.  Downey has fantastic chemistry with Paltrow, frankly im not her biggest fan, but I really liked he in this, mainly because she perfectly played off of Downey.  Bridges is chilling as Starks nemisis, it's weird to see him bald, but it added to his chilling look.  The CGI Ironman is incredible and his battle with Bridges at the end was spectacular.  I appreciated how the screenwriter wove issues we have today into the formula of the movie, it made it resonate all the more.  I could not recommend this movie any higher, it is a must see if your into this sort of action fick.
B000B8QG22|5.0|Actor Tung Thanh Tran, now known as Tom Tran, became an engineer in the Chicago area, married, and has three beautiful girls.  I am waiting for the day he returns to the silver screen.  He has a unique and special talent as a dramatic actor.
031606792X|5.0|When reading this book, you need to keep some things in mind:    1.  This is not Fordyce's Sermons to Young Women or the Book of Virtues. Although some readers argue that Stephenie Meyer has an obligation to hold Bella to the highest moral standards due to the wild popularity of these books, do you honestly think girls who are smart enough to read 600 page books are going to go do everything Bella does? I think not.  Besides... they got married before anything happened. Jeez.   2.  This is a FANTASY BOOK. Stephenie has every right to do whatever she wants with her own fantasy world that SHE CREATED.  If she decides vampires can sprout wings or talk to animals or become invisible, then that's what they can do in HER FANTASY WORLD.   3.  This is not an epic work of literature that will be read in classrooms 100 years from now, and was never intended to be.  If the Mrs. Meyer crank out 4 600+ page books in 4 years, do not expect them to be Romeo and Juliet or Pride and Prejudice, or even Harry Potter.  4.  If there was no happy ending and Edward or Bella or Jacob or Alice died I would cry my eyeballs out and SO WOULD YOU!  Don't deny it, you would be crushed.      Personally, I totally enjoyed this book.  There was a lot going on, but Bella turned into a character that I really grew to respect (I disliked her in the previous books) due to her willingness to sacrifice her life to protect the people she loved.  And she kicked butt.  I got my happy ending in a nail-biting, action-filled, overall great fantasy novel.
1573229725|5.0|This is melodrama, but intelligent, entertaining and well-written. It kept me guessing, and it kept me turning the pages throughout its not inconsiderable length. Its period Victorian color is well-done; its romance, eroticism and violence are all tastefully rendered.Highly recommended.
031606792X|4.0|I loved the book, my daughter hated it.  I can't sit down to read the first three (I've tried), but she devoured them.  See a pattern?  This was not a YA book, it was adult.  When Bella married she crossed the line into adulthood, and Stephanie Meyer was writing about adults, with adult problems.    I think this book had a profound pro-life message, which I appreciated.  In case you missed it, the first three books were about sacrifice, abstinence, self-control.  This one was about life being precious, and about a mother that was willing to sacrifice anything for her baby.  I've felt those emotions myself.    I don't approve of marrying at 18, but I guess when the groom's permanently stuck at 17...    I'm just jealous that Bella got a baby that sleeps through the night!
031606792X|3.0|I wanted so much to LOVE this book and ended up only liking it. It started out great. I got through book one, angry that it left Bella, eager for more. Unfortunately, it became entirely predictable from there. You knew what was coming next every step of the way. I hoped for something shocking, something... interesting, but never got it. I just wish that she had gone out on a limb. I think that she took the easy way out with Jacob even if she laid it out to make total sense that it would make a stronger wolf. I never really go the whole point of the imprinting thing anyways. I enjoyed the book nonetheless. I was disappointed because I thought Meyer could have done so much more! But, we all knew it had to have a happy ending, didn't we?
031606792X|3.0|Twilight was definitely my favorite.  New Moon and Eclipse went in a direction that I didn't particularly like, but I was still excited to read Breaking Dawn and finally have the love story resolved.      Well, it was certainly resolved.  I've been reading what others have written and I agree with much that has been said.  I honestly had no preconceived expectations and therefore was not as disappointed as some other readers.      There was not much of a love story in this book.  I just didn't feel the magic was there between Bella and Edward.  I frankly don't care about Bella having a baby with a vampire - it's Stephenie Meyers' story and I just read it - but I thought it was a little fantastical for the baby to grow SO darn quickly and just about kill Bella while she (of course) acts overwhelmingly immature and self-sacrificial.  And why the heck did she have so many dreams about a baby boy if it was going to turn out a girl?    The baby's name didn't bother me - and even Jacob imprinting on the baby didn't bother me as it was introduced previously with Quill.  I did think (to agree with some other readers) that it was a little too nicely wrapped up.  So Jacob can't have Bella?  Well, let's just let him have her daughter when she's all grown up.  I actually really liked the baby.  The way she was described was very sweet and likable. It wasn't explained though as to why the baby only liked blood, even though it was part human and had a beating heart...shouldn't she need SOME human sustenance?    The last section of the book was the best in my opinion.  Bella had been so whiny and grating and self-sacrificing for SO LONG.  FINALLY, she had some redeeming quality about her - she was MADE to be a vampire.  I liked that she took to it so well.  The story would also have been good if she had had more trouble as a newborn - but with so many storylines already, that would have muddled the book even more - better to simplify the story so that Bella only has to hunt like maybe one time.  ;-)  I thought her power was a good power.  I mean, she's not going to suddenly have some super weird new power.  The shield thing was a natural extension of who she already was.      Several people are upset about this book because Bella is married at 18, has a baby at 18, etc. and they're complaining about what kind of message Stephenie Meyers is sending young girls...well, just remember, Stephenie Meyers is of a particular religion that tends to marry and reproduce young anyway.  I don't think she was consciously trying to send some message to young girls that you should depend on a man, etc.  I think it's just so commmonplace in her life experience that she probably didn't realize how some people would feel about that kind of plotline.    All in all, it was a good book.  Not my favorite, but it ended the series in it's way.
1400032717|5.0|I have never read anything that even remotely resembles this novel, it is so unique and cleverly written from the first person perspective of a boy with some type of autism. Christopher Boone goes to a special school, doesn't understand basic figures of speech or facial expressions, but is gifted with a genius skill at math. When his neighbor's poodle is found murdered by pitchfork one morning, Chris is almost blamed for the crime and decides to find out who the real dog killer is.      I flew through this book in less than 24 hours because it was just that good of a read.
031606792X|1.0|Wow...what can I say that hasn't already been posted here about Breaking Dawn. As much as it pains me to say it I completely agree with all the bad reviews. I won't post spoilers here but Breaking Dawn was a huge disappointment for me. I really wanted to enjoy this book but instead I was left speechless, disappointed and upset. I throughly enjoyed  Twilight, New Moon and Eclipse and was anxiously waiting for Breaking Dawn. However this book really has changed my mind about the whole series. I use to recommend the series quite often and I probably will continue to recommend the first three with a warning to stop after the 3rd book. I would have happily waited another year for a better Breaking Dawn then what we just got. Please someone tell us that this was a bad dream.
0743290119|3.0|I had high hopes for this book.  I loved her previous books and couldn't wait to read this one.  Well, it took me about three weeks to finish it..only because I really wasn't interested in the three characters, at times they truly worked on my nerves and didn't care what happened to them.  Don't waste your time or money on this book!
031606792X|5.0|I LOVED Breaking Dawn with a passion.  I don't understand why there are so many bad reviews.  I just wanted to let Stephenie know that she did a WONDERFUL job finishing Edward and Bella's story ;)
B0015519VS|5.0|The vendor who sent this product to me is amazing;  quick,  thorough,  caring.  Thanks!
0316010669|5.0|Gladwell offers an intriguing look at how the subconscious or intuition of a person works in different situations, as well as how it can be trained and the importance of sometimes taking a step back before acting on a situation. This is a relatively quick read with some intriguing ideas offered in it. If you like this book, you may find it useful to track down some of the writings by people he references as they go into more depth than Gladwell does.
031606792X|2.0|I've been beyond obsessed with the Twilight Series since I first discovered it - this book has got to be the biggest literary disappointment that I've ever experienced.    It's like Stephenie Meyer was all about self-gratification instead of writing a daring, dynamic story. All of the things I loved about the first 3 books are gone in this one - the characters don't even seem like themselves. Some of the plot lines are good, but the vast majority of them read like bad fan fiction.    I still love the first 3 books - I'm still trying to convince myself to be a fan of Stephenie Meyer - I'm just going to pretend like I never picked up \\"Breaking Dawn\\".    I've never experienced this kind of turmoil over a book before - but this has been really upsetting.
031606792X|2.0|I have a healthy dose of respect for Stephenie as a writer - after all, Twilight was fantastic in every way. But I personally think Breaking Dawn was a huge mistake (well for me anyway). And I guess a writer can make that kind of lapse in judgement when she thought of writing that book.     But there were soooo many possibilities for this story, so many .... and she chose to produce what I think ended up being like a badly written mary-sue-ish fanfiction that completely undermined the beautiful epic love story between Bella and Edward, and the meaning of life and making difficult choices. I'm not saying there's something wrong with Bella ending up having everything, but there could have been a million other ways for her to have it without it being so....I don't know....mary-sueish I guess? It could have been just a bit more meaningful, deeper?   Even the writing felt wrong, broken up, as if Stephenie was short on time or something.  Also, after they got married, everything Bella and Edward seemed to think about when they were alone was sex.  Where's the connection they had before? Where's the companionship that true love represents? All this disapeared as soon as they got married! It was so out of character! What kind of strong relationship is that supposed to be? No relationship could survive just on physical attraction...I don't know...maybe it's just me, but I would think there would be more to married life than lovemaking, even if it's a definitely big part of it. Anyhooo...I'm digressing.    Please, please, please re-write the story, Stephenie!! I would gladly read it again!    As for this affecting the movie? No, not for me. For me, Twilight is the best book in the series, the one I really wanted to see come alive, the one that paints the quintessential forbidden and complex true love story that this book is all about. So, yes, I'll be the first one in line to watch the movie. BUT, if they ever make a Breaking Dawn movie, then, no, I will not watch it unless on DVD just to be able to say to myself that I've seen the entire series.
031606792X|3.0|More like 3 1/2 stars. I didn't hate the book.  I just thought it felt vastly different from the previous 3.  Unlike many,  I don't think the series went downhill from book 1.<br />Eclipse was my personal favorite.<br />I just feel that the ethereal magical soulmate moments that made Bella and Edward so compelling was pretty much missing.  I found myself looking for those quotable \\"quotes\\" in this book, and found none.<br />I didn't mind the pregnancy thing, or the anticlimatic Volturi conclusions. I expected Bella to be an atypical newborn.  I liked the wedding scene alot, it was very sweet. The rest of the book though,  felt slightly darker than previous books,  more geared toward the adult reader.<br />Not sure if its appropriate for the under 16 reader.<br /> I just miss the Bella/Edward magic.<br />It seemed that the story was a little convoluted with the introduction of several 'going nowhere' characters///like the girl lizzie that jacob meets.....huh?????? pointless page filler.<br />And all the extra vamps at the end?  To many new characters introduced at the very end of the book.<br />And the fake passport guy....and another pointless page filler.<br />Again....It seemed that there wasn't enough quality Edward/Bella time.  Imo,  if Smeyer was going to do something as plot twisting as a pregnancy,  we should have seen way way more  intimate interaction/moments between E/B instead of viewing the entire thing from Jacobs POV.<br />I didn't hate it.  I am very happy for the HEA, and the sense of closure that brought.  I just didn't have that sigh of contentment that I had hoped for when I read..the end.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|The DVD's are well worth watching over and over again. This show is so awesome and intelligent. There are new things to see every time I watch an episode again. It is dark and creepy, but also funny. Has a lot of brotherly banter and love, angst and pain. The stories are interesting and never boring, the special effects are never cheesy. The guys are hot but more than that, they are awesome actors, that grow with the show.
031606792X|1.0|The only book in this series worth reading is Twilight. It all goes downhill from there. I've never read another series with such a STUPID and irritating \\"heroine\\" like this series. Meyer doesn't deserve the comparisons to Rowling. If we're talking about writing skills and creativity here, Meyer isn't even fit to shine Rowling's shoes.     Don't waste your money on this garbage. It's a ridiculous end to a shallow, barely mediocre series, which will undoubtedly be forgotten in less than five years.
031606792X|1.0|First I'd like to say I'm 27 & I've loved every second of the first 3 books.  Now I'd like to say ARE YOU KIDDING ME???      This was supposed to be the ending, the ribbon that wraps them all up, makes you laugh, cry & in the end smile.  There are so many things that Stephenie Meyer COULD HAVE done with this story that people may not have liked, but at least could have learned to accept, reasoned their way through and eventually loved.  What she has done here just really isn't in that realm for me.  This book feels disjointed & completely separate from the first three novels.  It feels like it was written by a different person, not the Stephenie Meyer I know & love.  The characters are hollow shells of the strong & opinionated ones I've loved so dearly.  The plot is lame & at some points so ridiculous I couldn't even stand it.  Plot twists are one thing & unexpected is normally good, but this was so BAD there really aren't words.  It felt like there was no climax at all, just a huge build up with no release & then THE END.  I am so disappointed.  I'm angry.  I want it to be rewritten & whoever let THIS book out into the public to be fired. It taints the first three books and that's so wrong, because the first three are masterpieces & this is just some bad fantasy a 12 year old girl had that got put onto paper.  When I saw it was over 700 pages I was truly expectant of a fantastic finale.  Instead I believe I am done.  If Stephenie Meyer continues to write with these characters from a different perspective (as she's alluded to many times in the media) I will not be reading it.
031606792X|1.0|This has to be the single greatest letdown in literary series history.     Although I was mortified about it and wouldn't admit it to anyone or let anyone catch me reading the books because they were so poorly written, I loved Twilight and New Moon. Eclipse was so-so.     But this hunk of junk - I can't even call it a \\"book\\" - is TERRIBLE. I was disappointed by HP6, but that sentiment was a grain of sand compared to the absolute landslide of indignation I'm bubbling with now.    I'm pissed she ruined a decent series. I'm insulted that she thinks so little of us that she had the audacity to publish something like this and assume we'd all love it. I'm heartbroken that I'll never get to obsess over it again, because it was fun and mindless and took me away from reality to some never-land with fictional creatures and improbable romance. I know this all sounds melodramatic, but I'm young and have a tendency to become totally immersed in book series.    This is horriffic. It's almost surreal, it's so awful. The entire novel's basically about sex and childbirth. I thought we were going to have a decent romance novel free from details like that? She completely avoided subjects like that before, including the topic of Bella's - y'know - only to haul them right out into the open. \\"PMS\\"? \\"Stud service\\"? \\"Lingere\\"? I never thought I would be subjected to those terms, or all that accompany them, in this relatively innocuous series. This is not what I signed up for. Everything was just TOO MUCH. I understand teenagers are hormonal, but the details were just too - graphic. The wrong ones. I literally got queasy about an eighth of the way in. How could she do this, knowing all those small girls would be reading?    I'm not going to see the movie, or have anything else to do with the series. This one ruined the entire thing, and I was embarrassingly obsessed. I can't even go re-read Twilight for the zillionth time because I know what's coming, and it literally makes my skin crawl. The whole \\"imprinting\\" thing has a vaguely incestuous overtone to it that makes me squirm. The honeymoon was ridiculous and too much about consummation.    I have a very high tolerance for questionable material. One of my favorite books ever, second only to Wilde's Dorian Grey, was Hannibal - and I loved Harris' ending (the book was radically different than the movie, to clue in the unenlightened). But this is just disgusting.     Every single character except Jacob acts like a zombie... it's like Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Were it not for the names, you wouldn't recognize anybody.    It's not a letdown. It's a flat-out HORRIBLE book, in and of itself, considered independently of expectation. It's worse than fanfiction I would roll my eyes at.    What psychopath editor allowed this cacophony of half-baked idiocy to get published? What was Meyer thinking??     Am I dreaming? Will someone PLEASE kick me into consciousness?    Is this some elaborate joke? Is the real book coming out next month?    Have I been Punk'd?
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Yet another cool album from Coldplay. I love the changes they have made to their playing styles this time around. Don't get me wrong, I love the previous albums, but this is probably the first one that really feels like they let their guitarists \\"loose\\". The riffs on \\"Violet Hill\\" are awesome. Besides the released songs \\"Violet Hill\\" and \\"Viva La Vida\\", I'd have to say that \\"42\\" is my favorite song on this album.
031606792X|2.0|I wasn't exactly thrilled with this book, after all, I was expecting a fight, and I didn't get one. :sigh: oh well. I love every single book in the Twilight series, but I cannot say that I wasn't let-down slightly with Breaking Dawn. The Reasons...<br /><br />1) SM has said over and over that vampires cannot breed, but then she turns around and gives Bella and Edward Renesmee (aka, Nessie). I am not critisizing her choice, though I would have ben much better about the book if Renesmee had never been born, or was Jacob's daughter instead of Edward's. Buuut, I can also say that I was thrilled that Edward got what he thought imposible-a beautiful baby daughter-since he deserved it. With the birth of Renesmee, you get to see Edward's protective/fatherly side, not so much in the beginning, but nearing her birth. So, I can't say that it was a totally hideous idea...<br /><br />2) I was hoping for much more tension between Tanya and Bella, but there was none. It was almost like they'd known each-other for years. I can't say that I am exactly happy about that, but, then again, I suppose the book would have been much longer if there was tension between the two women.<br /><br />3) The Volturi. Plain and simple. I was dying to see a fight between the Cullen's(with their friends) and the great rulers of the Vampire world, but was dissapointed that that conflict was also resolved too easily. I guess that it was for the better because one of the Cullen's would have to have been injured to keep it from seeming that they were invinsible and I would've hated it if any of them (except Rosalie) was hurt.<br /><br />Overall was the book a major failure to me...no, but the lack of heart-wrenching action was a tad bit of a turn-off.<br />I would personally give this book 2 stars, simply for the lack of action and drama we were all promised and expecting.
031606792X|5.0|I totally LOVED Breaking Dawn. I waiting in line, got it, rushed home, and read until I finished it. It is a little different and weird but I love it all the same. It is true that it isn't what I was expecting but it was so much more. SM's imagination kicked my butt and I was so happy that it ended the way it did. I wouldn't changed anything about this book...its an emotional rollercoaster! ENjoy :)
B000OVLBFS|4.0|Tom Selleck makes a fine Jesse Stone. The dialog that Parker writes is very entertaining.
031606792X|2.0|I am not going to bash Meyer...how could I when I got so much enjoyment out of reading the Twilight Series???? But, I was expecting Breaking Dawn to capture the consequences of the choices Bella made.  Every possible issue ended up perfectly for Bella.  No great battle, no newborn phase, no remorse for the child that could never be, no regret for missing a parent, no college.  Oh, and if you told your parents that you were in the CDC for having a rare illness and then later told them they would rather not really know everything going on...would your parents buy it?  Not mine.... Meyer was too worried about tieing up the loose ends that she failed to give us the conflicts, the conversation, the book we waited for.....    She basically wrote a modern day version of Cinderella, sci fi style, where everything ends so perfectly...even the Romanians were disappointed....they didn't get their battle, either. So if you are expecting something like Twilight, take a deep breath...you will be disappointed.
031606792X|2.0|I was very disappointed with this book.  The 3 books prior to it in the twilight series were the books that captivated and enticed readers.  This final book really destroyed the series. I wish i hadn't read the book.  In the original books the main characters were very relatable and the plot and ideas were almost believable.  This book had so many plot holes and very poorly thought out ideas. Also it was rediculously unbelievable. In many parts, repetative as well.   This book was very graphic and its not for the faint hearted. I recommend not reading this book so you do not ruin the other 3 twilight books.
031606792X|5.0|This book was not what I expected. In a good way of course. I loved that the book was told from two perspectives.  Bella grew up in this book. Yes she was frozen in time at 18, but she was grown up...she made grown up decisions. She has developed so much from the first book. Now she is someone completely different..in a good way.       Listen you fun suckers (all of you who gave this book a bad rating)...I think that this was a perfect ending to the Saga. At the end of book three it's true I hated Jacob...I mean how could he do that...make life so confusing. But that is what life is confusing, heartbreaking, and hard. It wasn't meant to be easy. But I had read her book \\"The Host\\" and knew that everything would turn out fine. So WHAT if Jacob imprinted on Renesmee? Who cares? Don't you see..it was predestined. Bella was meant to meet Edward and become a vampire. Jacob was MEANT to reconnect with Bella...so that he could imprint on her daughter. It had nothing to do with happy endings...it was meant to be.     As for this whole teenage pregnancy crap...ok. I certainly don't want to go out and get pregnant after this book. Haha. That is the funniest thing. She was married for goodness sakes...hello. Isn't that the part people have been trying to get there kids to do...get married before they have sex...which is exactly what Bella and Edward did. Then they had a kid...wow...what a sin..not. Most parents do it that way.
031606792X|1.0|SPOILERS:    I finished it last night at 11:30 and seriously thought that I would have nightmares from the pregnancy/birth scenes.  The tone was different, the characterizations were terrible, and she made use of the deus ex machina repeatedly.  And obviously.  I have never thought of Meyer as a great writer, but now, I don't think she is a good one.  And considering that Bella is clearly a Mary Sue, it makes me really wonder about her personal value system.    I am disappointed, and wondering if Meyer has effectively ended her career.  I don't think I have ever witness such a downward spiral in a series before.
031606792X|2.0|let me start off by saying things i hated about this book. actually.. there's only two main things i hated about the book.<br /><br />spoilers ahead!<br /><br />the biggest thing i hated about breaking dawn was the whole jacob imprinting on bella's kid. um.. what? did you really have to go there meyer? all through the book you mentioned how everyone was \\"goo\\" around bella's kid (i refuse to say her name/nickname). why couldn't it be the same for jacob? what was wrong with him imprinting on someone else, and still help bella and edward with the kid because of his past with bella? he didn't have to imprint on her kid to still be part of her familiy. it was weird, and sick, no matter how much you try to sugar coat it. not right. i feel bad for the jacob/bella fans. they ended up with this sick twist like it suppose to make them feel better. i bet a lot of people wished he ended up alone rather than imprint on bella's daughter. i think i would've preferred he died protecting bella than having this .. whatever it was.<br /><br />second thing.. the pregnancy of course. now i wouldn't have mind it if bella ended up being pregnant with edward and the pregnancy was normal and the baby itself was human. it wouldn't have made sense. but i would've accepted that more than what we actually got. i mean... vampire is not something you are born with.. it's something you're turned into. how is it that this kid is half vampire and half human???? it doesn't make sense. and the whole incubus explanation was total bs. that was just a lame excuse to get bella knocked up and did nothing but confuse us further.<br /><br />the birth scene i didn't mind much. it was intense and very interesting. i'll giver her that. but the baby growing too fast and just.. everything screamed sci-fi and i wasn't aware that this book was suppose to tie with the host. because with the whole speed up pregnancy/baby.. that's how it read. not that i didn't love the host.. but it just didn't belong in the twilight series.<br /><br />everything else i enjoyed. as cheesy as the first 7 chapters where.. i enjoyed them. that's what we wanted after all, wasn't it? bella transformation was awesome. i give meyer kudos for actually going further with it. not that i was worried that bella wouldn't changed. i was worried that we wouldn't read how it affected her. i do think that she took the easy way out by bella having a easy time with the change. but it some weird way... it makes some sense. her power was great as well.<br /><br />some chapters were slower than others.. but i still enjoyed them. the ending was cheesy as well... but it was nice seeing that they finally got their happily ever after. it's just a shame that i couldn't enjoy the book as i wanted to because of the things that.. in my opinion.. were unnecessary and confusing.<br /><br />such a disappointment that the saga had to end like this. it's just like harry potter all over again. including the weird baby names. sorry meyer. i wanted to enjoy it.. and i somewhat did. i'll be honest.. i did. but nessie made it really hard for me to love the book.enjoyed. as cheesy as the first 7 chapters where.. i enjoyed them. that's what we wanted after all, wasn't it? bella transformation was awesome. i give meyer kudos for actually going further with it. not that i was worried that bella wouldn't changed. i was worried that we wouldn't read how it affected her. i do think that she took the easy way out by bella having a easy time with the change. but it some weird way... it makes some sense. her power was great as well.     some chapters were slower than others.. but i still enjoyed them. the ending was cheesy as well... but it was nice seeing that they finally got their happily ever after. it's just a shame that i couldn't enjoy the book as i wanted to because of the things that.. in my opinion.. were unnecessary and confusing.     such a disappointment that the saga had to end like this. it's just like harry potter all over again. including the weird baby names. sorry meyer. i wanted to enjoy it.. and i somewhat did. i'll be honest.. i did. but nessie made it really hard for me to love the book.
031606792X|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and couldn't put it down.  The final book of the Twilight Saga (from Bella's point of view) was absolutely nothing like I'd predicted beforehand and could not have wrapped up up the story in a better way.  It was so enjoyable I'm going to read it again!
031606792X|5.0|Wow.  I don't know what else to say, but wow.  Everything fit together perfectly and just like Stephenie said \\"This is the way it was always meant to end.\\"  I loved it.  Breaking Dawn Completely took my breath away.  I don't want to say anything about the plot but I do believe both team edward and team jacob fans will be happy.  THANKS STEPHENIE!!!!
031606792X|2.0|well. that book kinda dissapointed me. i didnt really think it was bad but i dont really understand what was going through her head when she was writing it. the whole pregnant then imprint thing was waaayy over the top and totally cheesy. but i mean if that was the ending she wanted then she got it plus about a million angry fans.
031606792X|3.0|Well, clearly a lot of people were disappointed with this book. I wasn't one of them. It didn't come close to comparing to Twilight or New Moon, but I liked it better than Eclipse and I thought it was a good wrap up for the series. It definitely took some turns I wasn't expecting and, at some points, got kind of weird (even for paranormal), but at no point was I bored or did I want to throw the book against the wall (like I did with Eclipse).<br />Admittedly, though, Bella and Edward didn't seem quite the same as the characters I'd come to love and the story didn't have quite the same emotional depth.<br />Overall, it was worth reading and I don't regret buying it to complete my series. If Meyer gives Jacob his own book or series, I'll definitely read that and I'm still anxiously awaiting Midnight Sun, her retelling of Twilight from Edwards perspective.
B00008YJH5|5.0|The 80s was for the most part, a horrible decade for music.  But as you look closer you find that the underground was where all the truly great music was.  Groups like Fang, The Replacements, NWA, Public Enemy, and Husker Du pushing against the mainstream Warrant, Bon Jovi, Wham..etc.  The Pixies were of course in the brilliant rather than the popular, which seemed to happen with many underground great bands, and never completely came up to the surface (Except for developing a huge cult following).    Everything you have heard about this album is deserved.  Abrasive as the most hardcore songs on Husker Du's Zen Arcade (\\"Pride\\", \\"I'll Never Forget You\\"), yet with a small allowance of melody.  It makes sense that Steve Albini from Big Black would be willing to produce the band, because this music is intense.    Now, while I prefer the Pixie's second full release Doolittle for songs, Doolittle is essentially the same album with catchier melodies, and Surfer Rosa is nothing if not raw.  Listening to the album is a lot like having toasters thrown at you while you ride your bike down the street: It's exhilarating but you wouldn't want to do it all day long.     On to the actual songs.  One of the two best songs Kim Deal ever wrote is here in \\"Gigantic\\", while her other best is now featured on VH1 countdowns, go figure.  \\"Bone Machine\\", \\"Break My Body\\", \\"Broken Face\\", and \\"Vamos\\" are all brilliant intense songs, but \\"Where Is My Mind?\\" is the climax here and maybe the best song the Pixies ever wrote.    If you're going to get into Pixies, I wouldn't recommend diving headfirst into Surfer Rosa, Doolittle is much easier the first time around.  But while Doolittle is their most melodic and fun album, Surfer Rosa is by far their most intense and one of the greatest albums of the 80s.
0812974611|5.0|Robert Harris does a terrific job with this book.  It's filled with suspense and fascinating historical details.
031606792X|1.0|Goodness, where to even start?  I am 30 years old and I have been an avid fan of Stephenie Meyer since she was first published.        Breaking Dawn on it's own is a fantastic book - if analyzed completely separate from the rest of the Twilight series. BUT I believe that many fans will be severely disappointed (as I was) with the final book for the following reasons, which is the reason why I gave it a 1 star rating (I am sooo sorry, Stephenie):      1.  The tempo of the book is off. Stephenie's writing style is pleasantly rambling with beautiful descriptions of scenery, emotions and action in Twilight, New Moon and Eclipse.  Instead, Breaking Dawn felt like she was trying to fit 2,000 pages of material into 800 pages (which she probably was).  It would have been better to have allowed this complicated (and mature plot line) to have unfolded over two or more books instead.  Too much happened too soon (imagine books 5, 6, and 7 of Harry Potter all being crammed into one book - it would have been HORRIBLE, non-sensical and irritating).      2. The themes of the book take a sudden mature turn (i.e. this is not a YA novel).  We were all warned that Book 7 of Harry Potter was more mature and we felt it coming.  We were warmed up to the complicated themes of love, death and destruction through the series.  I am SHOCKED that Little Brown did not warn readers of the mature themes in this book.  Sex, Sex, Sex, pregnancy, vomiting fountains of blood and infantile imprinting.  I'm not saying it isn't a great story line, I was just shocked by it because it does not mesh well with the first three books.       I laughed when I accidently came across some spoilers on Amazon on August 1st and almost posted how silly people were for believing \\"fake\\" spoilers that were so obviously taken from a fan fiction site - to my horror, as I read, I discovered they were real spoilers.      While I was standing in line to buy my book yesterday morning I got into a conversation with a father inline behind me buying two copies of the book for his young daughters (probably 11 and 12).  Now that I have finished the book, I wish I could rewind time and WARN him that this is ABSOLUTELY NOT a young adult novel.  It contains VASTLY more mature content than Stephenie's supposid first adult novel The Host (which was excellent).  This book contains seriously mature themes (sex, violence, teen pregnancy - sorry, guys, I don't care if she's married) and I would not recommend it for teens under 15, personally.  And even then...    3.  Poor, poor Twilight Moms.  One of the reasons why I LOVED this series was because of Stephenie's gift for \\"the tease.\\"  She created beautiful characters with a beautiful, passionate, and strangely realistic relationships that were defined by emotion, BEFORE physical intimacy.  True love.  Realistic?  I don't know.  But we all wanted to believe that it was possible for two individuals to be completely head over heels in love without ever being able to express it with more than a peck.  This is classic old world romance in a modern day form.  And gosh, what a fantastic example for youth today!  Did we all know that Bella and Edward would eventually find a way to consummate their relationship?  Well, yeah, but the story before that was so much more interesting and fulfilling, especially in a world that already revolves so much around sex.  So I felt cheated when it finally did happen, regardless that marriage was involved.  And pregnancy at 18, even if you are married, is just not cool.  Sorry.  That's my personal view, but I don't think I'll be alone.     4.  Inconsistencies - Stephenie bends the rules of the Twilight universe to attempt to give everyone a happy ending.  Ugh.  I'm not going to go into detail, but beautiful themes in the first three books (like the  emergence of the werewolves in New Moon and the love triangle and Victoria's revenge in Eclipse) were planted and cultivated in the previous books.  But vampires have no bodilyfluids other than their venom - they can't cry but they can produce... ahem, fluids to make children?  And yet those fluids don't contain vampire venom?  Uhm... sorry that's too much of a stretch.  Themes in Breaking Dawn were sudden, unexpected and though some fit (Jacob's imprinting was made \\"realistic\\" by being foreshadowed by Quil and Claire in Eclispe), but were just plain weird.                I will attempt to pretend the series ended with Eclipse and try to forget this craziness so that I can fully enjoy the Twilight movie when it comes out in December.  I hate to say it but I wish I had stopped at Eclipse and imagined my own conclusions to Bella's fate and resolutions with these beloved characters.
031606792X|1.0|Fans of the series are often very emotional about this book, and rightly so.  It is a magical thiing when an author can create a \\"universe\\" that the reader can step into.  But after all, it is a work of fiction and I would like to comment on the book from that standpoint.    Good writing has a consistent voice throughout a book(s), the voice of this trilogy has been Bella's.  I Breaking Dawn there are varied voices which causes the storyline to feel disjointed.  Unresolved conflicts are played out in scenarios outside the realm of the Twilight universe leaving the reader feeling there isn't real closure.  Many of the details are downright laughable and one has to wonder if someone other than Mrs. Meyer had a hand in writing the book because it ventures so far from the storyline throughout the trilogy.  Mrs. Meyer's skill at maintaing a balance of tension and excitement was not present is this book.    Like many books with much loved characters and skillful writing, one anticipates that the author will stay true to his/her writing style.  This reader felt a sense of loss and with disappointment with Breaking Dawn because the book is so very altered from the previous books.  I have donated my book to our local library and have chosen to leave the trilogy to stand on its own.  Breaking Dawn only tarnishes a memorable story.
031606792X|1.0|Just as a warning- there will be spoilers in here. And there will also likely be lots of incoherent sentences.     I need to vent. I can't help myself. Let's begin with the wedding. Everyone thought it was going to be such a big deal and that it would pretty much be the main point in the book. But no. The event we all have been highly anticipating happened within the first 50 or so pages in the book.     Then she gets pregnant. Pregnant. That's right- pregnant. I heard the rumors, saw the spoilers, even accidentally came across some of the scanned chapters, but I still didn't believe. I thought there was no way that Stephenie Meyer would have Bella, the girl who practically raised her mother and who cringed at the thought of marriage, get pregnant. Then she gets pregnant and she freaks out for a second. Um, let me tell you- I'm 18 and I'd have a heart attack, perfect vampire husband or no. I know the whole point is that Bella is always strong and doing what no one expects but PLEASE. Then there was the whole \\"all bodily fluids are replaced with venom, sperm dies, vampires can't have babies...\\" SM quote that people kept coming up with on the spoiler messageboards. What happened to that? I snorted, audibly, at the section of the book that explains this away. Correction- tries to explain it away. I read fanfictions that talked about this and every time, I xed them out because I thought it was ludicrous. I don't have to tell you my devastation when I realized that this would be central to the book.     I understand why SM decided to have a Jacob POV section, though I didn't like it. I got that we had to see things from this angle for the story. But did there have to be SO much? I put it down so many times through that. This is BELLA & EDWARD's story (even though that seems hard to believe a lot of the time).     Edward. I know it sounds silly but I feel like he was barely in it. I feel like none of the characters were really IN it. They all seemed miles away from who they were by the end of Eclipse. Alice, one of my favorite characters, felt really far away. I felt like Bella & Edward's love story got lost somewhere and then every once in a while SM would go \\"oh, let me pop in a significant glance!\\" They had fleeting romantic scenes, but most of them failed to ignite the spark that the others in the series had (and those were more chaste, for goodness sakes!). Ch 20 in Eclipse lives on.    Then Bella's shield. First of all, it annoys me that throughout the series, various obstacles have been placed before the characters that they stress over the entire book and yet, in the end, nothing happens. At all. Twilight was the only one where a little something happened- Bella gets attacked. New Moon was okay in the drama department. Then Eclipse comes along and the scene with Victoria happens in about two pages after all the hype. Then in this book we finally see the Volturi again, the threat that has been hovering over everyone since New Moon. What happens in the end? Nothing. They retreat. Aro apologizes for bothering them. Though the book ends on a note that things might not be completely over with the Volturi, we won't ever see that.     Now for Jacob's imprinting. All I can say on this is why? I've read the other reviews that have talked about this so I feel like there's nothing more to be said on this subject. One word will suffice- ABSURD. Oh, and WRONG.    The thing that really disappointed me the most, and that I already mentioned, is that I felt like we didn't get much time to spend with Bella & Edward as they once were. I felt like I was dealing with two different characters entirely, though some characteristics were still there. It was just weird.    I've heard people complain that the message SM sends out is all wrong but I never really paid attention to it until now. Sure, at times when reading the series I'd ask myself, \\"Doesn't this girl have any other interests besides Edward?\\" but then I'd remind myself Edward was a godand that, had I been in her shoes, I'd probably be pretty dazzled myself. But still. No one in real life is as perfect as Edward. Then, when I read this book, I finally got what people were talking about. Bella doesn't even mention college after she's changed. She has no other interests or desires other than Edward and her child now. I get the love and the bond and the inexplicable feelings that come along with that but I can't help but feel bad she has nothing to herself. It actually sends out a really bad message, especially in today's world. Edward is consumed with his love but he still has some hobbies, like his music.    Enough rambling. All I really wanted to say was that I was very upset all of my anxious waiting was for nothing. The disappointment I felt when I realized all of those horrific spoilers were true was acute. I can understand now when people spoke of boycotting it and now, I only wish I had followed in their example. My memory of the series is marred now and I'll think of my own ending after Eclipse. I'm happy there was a happily-ever-after but I couldn't feel anything at that point for the characters. They just didn't feel the same to me. Anything would be better than this- even fanfiction.
B0015KO52S|4.0|Much better than their last effort - Rock & some ballads ;).  Overall it's worth the investment, particularly if you enjoy listening to the lyrics and what they have to say.  Jack Whites influence runs rampant (so if you don't care for him, charnces are you won't like this).
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I have been waiting for \\"The Complete Epic 1902-1959\\" to be released on DVD for years. And now I want it on Blu-Ray. This isn't it. I'm talking about the 1981 VHS release of the first two films combined into one, in chronological order with additional scenes. Godfather II, as everyone knows, contains flashbacks which don't necessarily add to the narrative. Tell the story in the order it takes place, throw in some lost footage, and add the third film to that, and we have an awesome epic film that isn't interrupted by 3 sets of opening and closing credits, telling one continuous epic story... 1902-1979.<br /><br />This release has its place for purists, but I want the saga edition.
031606792X|5.0|Just read Breaking Dawn and I loved it. Please don't be discouraged by the negative reviews, its obvious that there are people out there who just don't get it. Meyers is consistent in her writing style from her previous books and even suprises in some parts.  The book is in three parts, however my favorite has to be Jacobs narration. Jacobs book is funny period. It only confirms  and enhances Jacobs sense of humor from previous books. Secondly, his connection with Edward comes as a welcome suprise. Bellas' narrations are wonderful and aptly portrayed.  Now to the plot!!which so many of you found terrible. I only have one thing to say!! ITS FICTION PEOPLE!!!! You want a realistic story then I suggest you choose something other than Vampries and Werewolves. Kudos to S. Meyers for making you believe that this story is viable. It means shes a good writer. How she came up with the concept of a pregnant Bella and all the cravings she has are unreal. Once again events leading up to the birth are written so well, its impossible to put the book down.   Take it from me, read the book yourself and judge it for yourself. I was initally put off by the reviews and am glad that I didn't listen to them. Its an amazing saga.
031606792X|4.0|I think that some people may judge this book too hastily... like I did. When I finished reading it the first time I did not know what to think. I loved it in some ways but was disappointed in it in others. I decided that I had to re-read it in order to figure out my true feelings. I think one reason people are responding negatively is because they rushed through the book. They didn't allow the characters to develop as they should and they made judgements without reading every word. Stephenie Meyer cannot and should not make everyone happy but I think she got pretty close. I agree that there are still a few things that I am iffy about, but it is her vision and her decision to write what she wants. I saw that everyone should stop complaining and re-read the book without past judgments.
0743200799|5.0|[[ASIN:0425179877 Failure is not an Option: Mission Control from Mercury to Apollo 13 and Beyond]]  This book came highly reccommended by other teachers at Advanced Space Academy for Educators.  It is a great companion to A Man on the Moon.    Gene Kranz is an inspiration for us all.  In today's world we need his message.  He makes one feel that if we can go to the moon then we can accomplish anything that we set out as a nation to do.
031606792X|4.0|I thought it was good in it's own right.  The storytelling and suspense wasn't as good. It mainly just finished the story of Bella and Edward.  It did put in a nice pretty package.  But if you like a love story and a happy ending, you will like the book.
031606792X|5.0|Okay, i can see some of what people are saying on here, but it was thoroughly enjoyable for me. Although i did want to rip Book 2 out and skip that, I trudged on and I thought it got way better from them on. Anyway, I did think some things were a bit over the top and not a huge amount of drama but I think I would have been mad if it hadn't happened this way.
031606792X|1.0|This book was such a huge let-down - I just don't know where to begin.  I wish SM had ended this series with Eclipse - in fact she could have just added the wedding to the end of that book and ended it with that!  Breaking Dawn was awful!  WHERE were Edward and Bella in this book?  Edward was relegated to a bit part - there was basically NOTHING of their characters (Edward and Bella)in this book.  I didn't even recognize Edward and Bella anymore.  Not to mention the total creepiness of the whole pregnancy and Jacob imprinting (UGH - To Catch a Predator anyone???) I did not connect to any of the characters in this book - my Edward was non-existant.  This book went way too far out - and what, did all the friends and family from town just disappear?  I wish I had stopped reading after Eclipse and I really hope that Breaking Dawn is NOT made into a movie.
031606792X|3.0|I just started reading this book series about 3 weeks ago.  I truly loved Twilight, but have been dissappointed more and more with each book.    I would say read this book if you have to know what happens to Bella. If you feel okay making up your own ending in your mind, that would probably be better.
031606792X|5.0|I know that there are so many people out there who are really disappointed with this one. To all of you, I say, I'm sorry. I think it was beautiful. I love that it all came together, especially since I was so worried about Jacob and his happily ever after! I got exactly what I wanted, though I don't think I knew what I wanted beforehand, and I feel blessed to have been introduced to this wonderful saga. I will never be the same!
031606792X|1.0|This last installment of the Twilight series is written as if it could have been part of some other series instead of this one. Very little makes sense in this book because it seems like SM was in such a rush to wrap things up that she ended up sending a really bad message to her teenage fans. I am sure that the bizzare twists and turns this book is not all her fault - she probably got ALOT of pressure from ALOT of people to finish this book quickly but it still does not let her off the hook.     First of all: Bella and Edward's child should have been completely left out of the book. Its not plausible that a very young Bella (who revolted at the thought of marriage in the last book,  Ecplise) would be so excited about getting pregnant with Edward's baby on their honeymoon when all she ever talked about before was what people would think of her if she married straight out of high school. However, now she gets pregnant and she can't wait to be a mother? Edward himself pleads for Bella to get an abortion and then go to Jacob to have him knock her up? Then as the baby is born Edward rips the placenta open -with his teeth???? EWWWWWWW.  After reading that part, I looked up from my book and thought \\"What the hell was she thinking?\\"    Everything from Bella suddenly wanting to wait to become a vampire just so she can have sex with Edward longer to the build up to an epic fight scene that never happened,  just left we with a headache and the huge weight of disapointment. Nothing in this book made alot of sense and I am wondering if she was having some sort of celeb mental breakdown when she wrote this.      As many people have said, this book is an AWFUL read for its intended fanbase - high school girls. It gives a false sense of motherhood and marriage. In fact, Bella barely takes care of the baby and Edward barely even holds the child. Jacob plays daddy and the baby is described as being more attached to Bella and Jacob then her own father, Edward. Most of the parenting responsibilities fall on poor 16 year old jacob and the rest of the Cullen family but Edward and Bella sure get it on alot ---puh -leeze.    Get ready for possibly another spike in the rate of teenage pregnancies folks - this book makes it seem to SM  millions of fans that having a baby out of high school is OK and everything will work out perfectly because every baby is nice and sweet and never cries or wakes up during the night like Bella's child and every man who father's a child will stick around and even deliver the baby for you like Edward does.     If you are a mother thinking of buying this book for your daughter, PLEASE don't.
031606792X|4.0|I believe that Breaking Dawn was a very good book.  Stephenie Meyer really brought me into the story with all the twists and turns that were involved.    The book is more mature then the previous books, so I believe that younger fans should be aware.  With that being said, I highly recommend it to someone looking for a good book.  In my own opinion, Stephenie did not let us down.
031606792X|2.0|The trouble with Breaking Dawn, and it is trouble, is that the characters don't develop the way that they did in the earlier novels. The novel reads quickly enough, and I was interested enough to finish it, but in the end it was a disappointment. The plot tied things up neatly, everyone getting what everyone wanted. After reading it, you would expect to come away satisfied. Unfortunately, this story just doesn't seem right. Perhaps the author was determined to have a happy ending, and skewered the plot to fit. There were too many conflicts in the story to allow for such a resolution.<br /><br />Bella's pregnancy simply did not work as a plot device. The reader will recognize the symptoms of her pregnancy pages before Bella herself realizes what is happening. I found that just plain irritating. The fact that Jacob imprints on Bella's daughter was weird. Jacob was so in love with Bella, and now he chooses her daughter? I couldn't accept that.<br /><br />I also have to agree with other reviewers. The message this novel sends to young people is not a positive one.  It is not a terrible novel, but it is a disappointment. The earlier novels in this series were much better. I have to agree with the overall negative tone of the reviewers.
031606792X|4.0|I understand where some people think this book sends a bad message to teenage girls, but I for one liked this book.  I read and watch so many things these days that try to shock and surprise their fans by killing off and having unresolved endings for their characters.  The world is so full of evil and news stories that focus on the bad that occasionally I enjoy a story where every things just works out.  Breaking Dawn allowed me, for a few hours, to lose myself in someone else's happy ever after, and for that I am greatful.
0670020745|4.0|I debated over whether to give this book three, four, or five stars.  The information that Dr. Taylor presents about the brain and stroke is worth five stars, without question.  But I have a few complaints about how she presents this information; and lots of complaints about the \\"self-help\\" aspects of this book.  I almost wish I could post two reviews of this book -- a five-star review for the information about the brain and stroke; and a two-star review for everything else about the book.  I ended up giving the book a (somewhat charitable) compromise rating of four stars (but in some ways the four star rating is too low; and in others it is way too high).<br /><br />Let's start with the positives:  This book is a must-read for anyone who is interested in the human brain and how it functions, any health care professional or caregiver who deals with stroke patients, anyone who has a friend or family member who has had a stroke, and anyone who is concerned about the possibility that they might someday suffer from a stroke (a statistical possibility, since about 700,000 Americans will have a stroke this year).  If you want to know about what it's like to have a stroke and to recover from it, this is the book to read.  Dr. Taylor is a brain scientist who had a stroke and lived to tell her story of survival, recovery, and rehabilitation.  The information she provides about her personal experience is priceless for anyone who wants to better understand what happens when someone has a stroke, and what is needed for recovery and rehabilitation.  This information is also of extreme value for anyone who wants to better understand how the brain works to make us who we are.  Five stars for the information on the brain and stroke.<br /><br />But now I must deal with the negatives, and comment on the \\"two-star\\" aspects of this book.  First of all, the writing style is a bit amateurish; but we can excuse Dr. Taylor for that, since she's a brain scientist, not a professional writer.But I do have a bit of a problem with how she tells her story.  What bothers me about her account is her description of what was going on in her mind while she was having the stroke and during her recovery.  She describes herself as having certain thoughts that just don't seem plausible given her description of the mental impairments she was suffering at the time.  She makes a point of saying that the language centers of her left cerebral cortex had been impaired, silencing the inner voice in her head, leaving her mind in a state of peaceful quiet.  Yet she goes on to describe thoughts that were running through her mind.  (How could she have such thoughts without that inner voice?)  I got the feeling that she was actually describing the thoughts that went through her mind years later as she was recalling her stroke experience.  (But, given the fact that our minds actually \\"construct\\" our memories as we reflect on our past experiences rather than simply recording our experiences and playing them back for us with perfect accuracy, this sort of thing is to be expected.)<br /><br />But what really annoyed me about this book was that, in the last few chapters, it turned into a sappy, shallow, self-help book of the \\"learn-to-love-yourself-and-think-happy-thoughts\\" variety; and includes what has to be the single corniest sentence ever written in the English language:  \\"When my bowels move, I cheer my cells for clearing that waste out of my body.\\" (p. 156)  In these later chapters, the book even delves into \\"New Age\\" stuff like \\"energy dynamics\\", Feng Shui, and \\"Angel Cards\\".  I felt that this seriously compromised the integrity of the valuable information that Dr. Taylor presented about brain science and stroke recovery.  This information is so valuable that I would still recommend the book in spite of its many shortcomings; but I would encourage you to take the last few chapters of the book with a grain of salt.
B001AZI1PA|5.0|Whenever you think of Jim Henson's Muppets, the fuzzy kooky variety shows and entertaining adventures of Miss Piggy, Gonzo and Kermit the Frog come to mind.<br /><br />But these versatile puppets have been used for far more dramatic effects in \\"The Dark Crystal,\\" an exquisite little fantasy story that happens to be entirely populated by puppets. Not a live person in sight, from start to finish. Henson and Brian Froud conjured up a gloriously detailed world -- full of fantastical flora and fauna, crystalline castles and strange creatures -- and wrapped it around a solid coming-of-age story.<br /><br />On another world, there are two strange races that appeared one thouysand years ago -- the enormous, gentle, peaceful Mystics, and the nasty, vulture-like, vicious Skekses who ruin the surrounding lands. Both races are somehow connected to a massive crystal that was broken a thousand years ago, and now a shard is missing from it. What's more, three suns are about to come into conjunction, and the shard has to be back in place when that happens.<br /><br />The Mystics have cared for one of the last Gelflings, an orphan named Jen whom they rescued from the insectile Garthim. As the conjunction approaches, they send him out to find the lost shard. Along the way, Jen gains the crystal shard for himself, and meets the only other living Gelfling, Kira. Now they must both evade the Skekses' Garthim henchmen and bat-winged spies, and somehow infiltrate their castle. But what will happen when the suns line up, and the crystal is completed?<br /><br />Many fantasy movies slap together a story that has been told many times before, but increasingly without interest -- throw in swords, some monsters, a brave prince or farm boy, and some evil witch/queen/wizard/Dark Lord. But fortunately nothing is so simple in \\"The Dark Crystal\\" -- although the origins of the Skekses and Mystics are pretty obvious from the very start of the movie, the journey along with Jen is what really makes this interesting.<br /><br />Instead of some pan-medieval land, \\"The Dark Crystal\\" aims at portraying a truly alien world, and Brian Froud's slightly weird designs make it seem so -- strange swamp reptiles, colorful anemones, vast crystalline castles, desiccated vulture-like creature, shrieking fuzzballs, and gorgeous forests full of strange plants and animals that tend to move and act in unique ways. \\"The Dark Crystal\\" leaves you feeling like you've been transported to some other planet.<br /><br />Additionally, this film also has the honor of being the first major movie to entirely star puppets, with nary a human being in sight -- some of those puppets still walk in a herky-jerky Muppet manner, but their design is utterly detailed and believable, from Jen's sort-of-human, fawnlike features to the vast four-armed Mystics, and the rattling armored Garthim soldiers. And the special effects end up being pretty spectacular, especially during the chaotic literally earthshattering climax -- while the finale is rather predictable, it is no less awe-inspiring for that.<br /><br />At times it feels like the characterization gets a backseat to the movie's visuals, but Jen and fellow Gelfling orphan Kira are fairly likable, naive young heroes who develop a cute little romance throughout the story. The various Skekses are given individual quirks and personalities (such as the annoying Chamberlain who won't stop humming).  Not to mention the abrasive, lumpy witch Aughra, who's an absolute riot (\\"Whole world might burn up... hmph... end of Augra!\\") and Kira's toothy fuzzball Fizzgig.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Crystal\\" has some predictable plot twists, but it is also a glorious visual feast and a coming-of-age journey with the Gelflings, leading to a finale both awe-inspiring and bittersweet.

0143038419|4.0|This is a story of a woman who after going through a messy divorce and an even messier affair decides she needs to find out who she really is. When the story started she never really seemed to know who she is and what makes her happy, so she comes up with an idea to travel for a year and discover herself in the process. She spends her year traveling equally among Italy, India, and Indonesia. In Italy, she spends most of her time eating and making friends. While in India, she spends most of her time in various forms of meditation and prayer. When she finally makes her way to Bali she is looking for balance, but she ends up finding love. While I can see where she has grown and has become more comfortable with who she is in the end, she seemed to spend a lot of time in all three locations engaged in excessive behaviors no real balance. It took me a little while to get into the story, I really wanted to like it and found it to be a decent little story.
0321544080|4.0|Mr. Steffens makes a number of very solid points in his thoughtful review of this book, and I would certainly caution potential readers to take note of what he is saying as I was hoping for more direct insight in terms of how to recreate some of the truly amazing photos that Mr. McNally has captured over the years.  If you are looking for a point by point instruction set on how to pose a subject, or exactly where to place lighting (in more than general terms), this is probably not the book for you.  That said, I still give the book high marks.  There is plenty of information that is useful for the experienced photographer about how to make some informed decisions when working on an assignment.  The work presented is certainly inspirational, and it's hard to imagine a step-by-step guide from a photographer who has had worked with any number of celebrities and captured award winning images.  The vast majority of photographers simply are not going to find themselves presented with many of the types of work that Joe has encountered (we can always dream though).  I still recommend that anyone who wants to learn more about Joe's work pick up this book, both for a source of inspiration and instruction.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|I was very pleased with the CD and the timliness of receiving the product from Amazon.Com.
031606792X|2.0|I've been reading other people's posts on here, so I don't think I could add much to what has already been said.  The reason I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1, is that I enjoyed the beginning.  The rest was a total Cluster F***
031606792X|1.0|I can't begin to express how disappointed I am with Breaking Dawn.  It's hard to even know where to begin. . .      ***Spoiler Alert***    The characters that any \\"Twilighter\\", such as myself, have come to love in the first three books of this series where almost entirely unrecognizable.  It is hard to even imagine this book being a part of the series because it differs so much from the tone and storylines of Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse.  I'm sorry that I introduced the series to a lot of my friends now, knowing that this is how the series will end for them.  I feel betrayed by Stephenie - that I was lured into reading this mess of a book forever tainting the characters that I grew to love.  I can never look at those characters again in the same way - or at least without having these terrible mental pictures of \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" playing alongside them.      If I can influence any Twilight fans out there, who haven't yet read this book, to not read it by writing my first ever review - then I will have accomplished something.  Don't spoil the series for yourselves by reading this book - let it end with Eclipse and you will be thanking those of us who told you to stay away from Breaking Dawn.  I kept saying to myself, this was such a waste.  All the possibilities that lay before SM to end this wonderful series.  Why?  I was looking forward to their honeymoon storyline (not that I wanted anything to graphic - just romance) - not a bruised Bella and a self-loathing Edward.  Then, the reader gets quickly sucked into a \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" take-off, complete with an \\"it\\" inside their mother - killing her - eating it's way out of her (now there's a picture I'm glad SM gave me to remember the series by!) - sucking the blood from elk alongside a now vampire Bella - oh, and imprinted upon by Jacob.  This was all so disturbing it's hard to put into words.    I could go on, but I want to assume the fetal position and listen to Twilight on my i-Pod to try and forget I ever readBreaking Dawn.
B000001GQH|3.0|If not for the excellent recordings of \\"La Mer\\" and \\"Bolero\\" (both worthy of 5 stars) this would be a one star review.  The trumpet playing in \\"Pictures\\" is unacceptable by modern standards.  The \\"Samuel Goldenberg\\" track is particularly bad.  It is poorly articulated and out of tune.  For reasons I can't explain, continental orchestras of this period lagged far behind their British and American counterparts in the area of brass playing.  You should still buy this recording for \\"La Mer\\" and \\"Bolero,\\" but look elsewhere for \\"Pictures.\\"  Better choices include (but are by no means limited to) Szell/Cleveland, Reiner/Chicago, and even Mata/Dallas.  Karajan's earlier recording with the Philharmonia Orchestra is far superior to this offering on DG, and offers excellent brass playing throughout.  It is available as part of the \\"Karajan 100th\\" box on EMI.
B000YABIQ6|4.0|The oddest television series of the last decade is actually better on DVD because you can take your time, pause and replay, enjoy the ambience and 60's cachet. A series that is written, acted and dressed in 1960 may not be everyone's cup of tea. But if you let yourself be transported back to that time, you'll enjoy this show tremendously. The characters are written with enough complexity to keep you interested, especially key mad man Don Draper, played with disturbing confidence by Jon Hamm. His enigmatic character touches the dark side in all of us, that little corner where secrets are kept and new realities are woven to accomodate them. Toss in institutionalized sexism, the relentless smoking of cigarettes and a sense of entitlement nurtured by television and you've got an edgy, completely original series that's deliciously dark and dangerous. Video quality is crackling clean. The 5.1 audio is subtle and there when you want it.
031606792X|1.0|Poor writing, terrible plot, hardly able to see the characters I KNEW and loved.  To neat of an ending, two neat PERIOD, and lastly... BORING.  I was bored and really didn't care one way or another if Bella lived or died, or any of them (well Jacob but I have a soft spot for that guy).    The book is being returned tomorrow and there is in my opinion no book 4 out there.  DO NOT BUY this book, rent it from a friend who wants to keep it, or buy it and THEN return it if you feel the need to read it but its crap.  The whole thing is CRAP.    PS the whole 'imprinting on babies' bit that she seems to really dig... is kind of grossed and makes me wonder what would happen if someone IMPRINTED on her baby if she'd be 'OK' with that.    Utter crap, don't get it... ugh so disappointed.. must go read a good book to wash out the crap that I just read.
B0008ENHUI|4.0|McQueen carries film beautifully. One of his finest performances.    The real story behind the story is that Henri Charriere, who wrote the novel the movie is based on, \\"borrowed\\" heavily from what other convicts' lived through, and one in particular--the real Papillon, who died in France a couple of years back.    Don't get me wrong, Charriere did his share of time on Devil's Island, it's just that not everything that takes place in the film actually happened to him.    Author Gerard de Villiers delves into it in a book entitled A BUTTERFLY PINNED.
B0012Q732O|4.0|This movie is about love set way back in time.  A boy falls in love with a girl, who came to the village when she was young.  When they are older, the woman gets taken away along with other villagers, and the young man goes after her.<br /><br />He travels through the snow, the plains, the jungle, and the desert to rescue his true love.  He learns about his father in his travels, and he gains the respect of other tribes through his brave actions of freeing a sabretooth tiger.<br /><br />The movie has wonderful scenery with the beautiful mountains, the mysterious jungle, the vast plains, and the unending desert.  It also keeps going back to the never moving star in the sky.  I was surprised to see the pyramids, but I was glad too because I understood where the movie was taking place.<br /><br />The main characters speak english in the movie.  There was another language in the movie used by the African tribes, but I'm not sure if the language was real.  It doesn't matter really because the movie makers translated.<br /><br />My favorite character was the teenage boy.  He wasn't the lead character, and I don't know his name.  But his mother died in the movie, and he followed the heros on their quest, joining them later.  He had no one, and I think he was brave and stronger than they thought he was.<br /><br />So, overall I did like this movie.  I thought it was great to watch.<br /><br />Thanks.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|I have read most of the reviews on this. The fact that a live \\"Trapped\\" was included made this entire collection worth the $30.    Isn't the point of being a music artist and selling music to keep putting out material that you... the fan... will WANT to buy? What would happen if Bruce included ALL of your favorite songs in one box set? What if \\"Tracks\\" included everything you all think it should have included? The answer is... There would be no reason for Bruce to put out anything else eccept new albums of new material that you would probaby bash anyway... saying things like \\"Bruce has lost it.\\"\\"His music sucks now\\"\\"Hasn't put out a great album since 'The River'.\\"    All of Bruce's releases are great. I didn't become a HUGE fan of All Things Bruce until I saw him live this year in Dallas. One of the most incredible concerts I have ever seen. And although he doesn't have the voice of an angel... he's no Pavoratti... he does have a distict voice and I could listen to him all day. So bring on more Greatest Hits Collections and box sets... include more rarities... and did someone say the is a 17 minute version of Born In The USA?? Holy crap! Put that on a CD by itself and charge $50 a pop! I'll but it!!
031606792X|5.0|Even though many people think this is not a good book it really is. It may not be what people were expecting it to be but that is part of what makes it good. It would be boring to read it if it was exactly what everyone was expecting. It has great twists in it that catch you off guard but it kept me reading until the very end. I couldn't put this book down.
031606792X|1.0|i thoroughly enjoyed the first three books and felt nothing short of utter disappoint upon finishing the fourth. i felt like i was reading a completely different series with breaking dawn.  characters were completely out of character.  the successful formula of bella, edward, and jacob was lost to unbelievable ideas and plot lines.  i know this is a fantasy book, but the previous three kept it simple.      talk about a complete let down.  like other reviewers, i wish i had stopped at eclipse.
031606792X|4.0|What part of fantasy are people having trouble with here? Is it the vampires and the shape shifters or am I missing something? What did you expect to happen, really? I mean, Meyer is Mormon (this is not meant to be disrespectful in any way) and with that knowledge I was sort of expecting certain things. I don't think getting married and having kids right away is that uncommon. I was pleasantly surprised that she gave Bella the sex drive that she did, it would've made her character a little \\"too\\" goody-goody. I also thought she tied it in nicely with the era that Edward was from, it would have been common then for people their age to marry and have children, and the continued mention that Bella was an \\"old soul\\" just helped reinforce that.     I guess I shouldn't get so defensive but seriously people. Could you lighten up a little? Not every book has to be a guide book for teenage girls. I mean, I HOPE they know the difference between fantasy and reality, come on. Whatever happened to the \\"suspension of disbelief\\" and letting yourself detach from reality for just a little while? Isn't that what good stories are for?    Whatever, I thought the whole series was great. Meyer has an uncanny ability to keep the urgency and forward movement of the plot going so that you can't help but turn the pages. There were two instances where I thought the descriptions were a little long, two, and it was a 700+ page book. I applaud her and hope that we see more, and different, things from her that just continue to get better.
031606792X|1.0|When I woke up this morning I was eager to get to the bookstore so I could pick up my copy of Breaking Dawn. (No I didn't stay up until midnight at an event hosted by a book store, that's really not my style)    I expected something on the level of the other book. Not a very challenging read but engaging and simple and interesting.  What I didn't expect was a published mess of fanfiction.    (Spoilers follow)    First I have to say that the character that she developed through Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse were for the most part gone. Not only were they missing, in their place were characters straight out of a nightmare of a fanfiction.  Bella was much too nervous in the first book. Much too stupid in the second, and totally unbelievable in the third. Edward was somehow blind to these dramatic changes and continued to be overbearing (and I love Edward, but come on). Jacob seemed relatively sane. Until he imprinted on Bella's child. And then pretty much everything went to hell.    Breaking Dawn not only set a poor example for young girls, it also made me really creeped out. I didn't have a big problem with the whole imprinting on a child thing. I mean, I thought it was a little on the sketchy side, but nothing major. The thing that creeped me out the most was Bella's inability and unwillingness to save herself.  I cannot fathom why she would risk her life for something that could have very well been a monster.  I have admittedly never had a child but I do have a clear grasp on the concept of motherhood.  Not only did Bella risk her life for what could have been a monster, (Which turned out to be a very very very badly named freak) but then after she was allowed to see her and hold her she didn't seem like a mother. Only like a babysitter. She seemed to be more focused on Edward than she was on her child, more concerned with having sex with Edward than with being a mother. In my eyes that's wrong.    The plot also lacked any originality (I was surprised to see immortal children, an idea that I had first read about in Interview With A Vampire by Ann Rice, even though those immortal children mentally aged, and I'm sure that that was a concept that already existed). The whole pregnancy disaster at first stuck me as a joke, in fact when I saw a spoiler that said Bella was pregnant, I didn't believe it. Boy was I wrong.  It seemed to me that Ms. Meyers paid a little too much attention to fanfiction and forgot that there is a lot of it that's filled with very very bad ideas.  This whole book was something out of a terrible sci-fi paperback.    I have to say that I am greatly disappointed. If I had wanted 754 pages of fanfiction I would have stayed online and not bothered wasting my money.    I'm forced to wish the series had been ended with Eclipse as to avoid the disappointment of having an (up to this book) solid series.
031606792X|5.0|I thought this book was fantastic.  It gave me everything I wanted - Bella and Edward together, Bella becoming a vampire, and a happy ending for Jacob.  It also gave me things I didn't even know I wanted - a baby, for one.  For those people who gripe that real life doesn't turn out this happy, I'll say this - haven't these characters been through enough already?  They've all had to go through horrible difficult things to get here - they deserve some happiness!  I thought the book was amazing, and I'm not going to read any more reviews from people who just want to gripe.  I loved it, and I don't need any of you to try to ruin it for the rest of us!

031606792X|3.0|Breaking Dawn was different than what I expected. There were parts I loved and parts I thought were ridiculous, stupid, and beyond outlandish.     Spoilers!!!    Bella's pregnancy was, in my opinion, the worst part of the book. I saw it coming from miles away and I felt it was written badly. It honestly felt like a fanfiction. And Renesmee? I think Stephenie Meyer may be rivaling JK Rowling for bad kids names for main characters!    I honestly had no problem with Jacob's imprinting on Renesmee. Again, something I saw from a mile away, but I did feel it made Jacob more likeable. Breaking Dawn, if anything, did make me really like Jacob when he was not lusting away after Bella.     Edward didn't really do a whole lot now that I think about it.....    The introduction of the issue of immortal children I found interesting and the climaxing scenes with the Volturi were not bad. Though the Volturi seemed much nicer in this book and a little out of character.     The book started out good, in much the style of the first three, but after the wedding it went downhill. It picked up a bit at the end but in all Breaking Dawn was just an OKAY read.
031606792X|1.0|Dear SMeyer,    Just because JK Rowling managed to pull of Albus Severus doesn't mean you can.    Quite simply because JK Rowling is an infinitely better writer than you and can make such things like lame names sound infinitely less lame than you and even with her, it was lame. By my standards, Renesme Carlie is beyond lame and just unbearably pathetic.    In addition, the rest of Deathly Hallows was amazing.  The same cannot be said about Breaking Dawn.    Sorry Smeyer, you don't get to catch a break.  Rewrite Breaking Dawn and fire your editor, it is partially his/her responsible to make sure the books he/she edits are not a complete failure.  He/she failed in this aspect abominably.    And please do not insist on making 5 hours of Breaking Dawn in theaters.  Two hours of torture is quite enough.  In fact, I would not even be opposed to just leaving out Breaking Dawn in general.  You are not Harry Potter and therefore do not deserve the treatment that the seventh Harry Potter will receive. Actual non-garbage substance happened in Deathly Hallows.   There is really nothing in Breaking Dawn that is worth creating a movie around---except perhaps a comedy. It would have people laughing until they cried.    This was my case when I read your book. Thank you for saving me 18$ as I will return the book promptly tomorrow morning and also for giving me something to laugh about. Your book was in fact, hysterical.    Please do not write anymore Twilight books and spare yourself the dignity before you make a book about Jacob and Renesme's beautiful twins that not only are gifted with speed and strength but are also capable of speaking with animals and flight. The twins will be named Billa and Bilward.    Thank you.
031606792X|2.0|**SPOILERS**    I found this to be an interesting read, but I was ultimately disappointed with the conclusion.  The entire series has played up the sacrifices Bella would need to make if she became a vampire: her family, her ability to have children, possibly her soul, etc.  Bella's relationship with Jacob showed how difficult and poignant this choice could be: she could see her future with Jacob, and part of her wanted that future.  But ultimately, she makes the choice to be with Edward and sacrifice everything.    But as it ends up, Bella sacrifices NOTHING for her choice.  She conveniently becomes pregnant before she is turned, Charlie is told--more or less--about her condition, and Jacob can still be a part of her life in a purely platonic sense.  All in all, the book seemed very anti-climatic.  Even when the Cullens ultimately confront the Volturi, there is no fight or loss; instead, the Volturi, the most feared vampires in the world, just turn around and go home.  There was no loss on either side.  It all seemed way too easy to me.    Like many other reviewers here, I didn't like the idea of Jacob imprinting on Nessie, but for different reasons.  I didn't mind the idea of him imprinting on a baby--when Quil did the same thing in \\"Eclipse,\\" it was explained that those relationships remained purely platonic until the child came of age.  But Jacob's sudden attachment to Nessie seems to invalidate everything that happened between Jacob and Bella in the previous books.  Bella and Jacob were in love, and it was visibly painful for them to be around one another after she chose Edward.  Then suddenly, Jacob's attachment to Bella can be explained away by, \\"It was just because I was destined to be your daughter's one-and-only.\\"  Again, way too easy...and too convenient.
031606792X|3.0|I am finishing BD Book and its nothing of what i expected to happen except the obvious parts like happy-ever-after and Jake had imprinted someone .There are bad parts in the novel, but others are perfect like the romance of the wedding, the honeymoon, or Jacob/Bella confrontation about who he had imprinted.      Much of the story was put together to make everyone happy but sometimes it lacked what twilight had. It had potential for something with more.    The plot wasn't the most original or the worse she could use. It destroys the vampire idea we had. First they are dead, now they are only stuck in that form? If it was only Edward and Bella, it was okay or posibility because she is \\"special\\". Then there is the name Renesmee, it's horrible  .   The story sometimes lacked action, romance and more fights. It had too much talking. I agree with the ones that said the story wasn't what I expected too read, is not that horrible but it's not that great. It deserves a chance.     There is one thing that I love in this book that the others lacked, Bella had maturity, she was responsible, not a dependant person and she really tried to be a person you can count on for something not the a modern Juliet for her Romeo.

031606792X|2.0|As the final book in the Twilight series comes to and end, I can't help BUT to say, HORRAY! The series itself has been over hyped, and therefore disappointing more and more, however, this book, hits a whole new level.  Without going into the 'substance' of the book, the author manages to change the beloved Isbella Swan, to a stupid girl who enjoys sex more then her own existence, Edward Cullen, to a self-loathe pity-party of a person who keeps on having relations with the aforementioned girl even through the bruises, and basically, changing the whole story from a romantic RELATABLE tale, to a supernatural freakfest, that comes off feeling rather cheap, and boring. The only shining beacon from the book is when it's written from Jacob Black's perspective, but even then, she manages to erase all of the progress he made as a character, and make him cheap and dull as all of the other characters in her book within one page. Simply to put it, Stephenie Meyer has ended up erasing all that we've come to enjoy from the characters, and turned them into shells of their former selves. With all of that being said, the only saving grace in this book is, at it's core, the mythology of the Vampires and the Werewolves, which helps this story become somewhat passable. For anybody who needs something to pass the time, then this book is perfect. However, to the fans who've followed the series for a long time, I feel that they won't enjoy the book at all, and even more so, I feel that she should've ended it at Eclipse.
0394800192|4.0|Three animals compete in the first half of the book to see who can have the most apples on top of their head. During the second half of the book, they escape an angry mob, happily collide with an apple truck, and end up giving the entire town ten apples on their heads as well. (What fun! Ten apples up on top! We are not going to let them drop!)    This is a good book both for early readers, and for young children learning to talk. Very simple, rhyming vocabulary, of the sort with intuitive spellings (so much of English orthography is a mess...!)    Please note that I do not recommend the board book version at all. They cut out the entire second half of the book, as well as good parts of the first half. In addition, the board book is poorly constructed. Just wait and get the real version instead.

0064430227|4.0|One night, the self-reliant Harold couldn't sleep, so he decided to go for a walk in the moonlight.    Using his crayon, he makes everything he needs - including the moon. He gets himself into accidental trouble with his crayon (accidentally making a sea, not making the second half of a mountain, making a city full of windows to get lost in), but he always manages to save himself with the same crayon (making a boat, a hot air balloon, and finally his own window \\"right around the moon\\").    He even puts himself to bed at the end, knowing he's tired.    Who wouldn't want a kid as independent and responsible as this kid?    It's truly a fantastic book, and you should definitely not ignore it.
031606792X|4.0|***An update 6 years later***<br /><br />I have friends who are talented singers, but I hate sitting next to them during someone else's performance. They can hear all the flaws in the music and can't help cringing or grimacing at the performer. Not being musically inclined myself, I can usually listen with enjoyment even if someone is hitting the notes a bit flat.<br /><br />This is sort of how I've come to feel about Twilight.<br /><br />When I discovered the series, three books had already been written.  I was pregnant and sick and blew threw them pretty quickly.  I was able to suspend disbelief and just read on auto-pilot, not really stopping to deeply consider the writing itself or any of the plot devices.  I had to wait a bit for book 4, and then read it straight through in a few hours, again, largely on autopilot (and still sick and pregnant, btw).<br /><br />Since then, I've been studying grammar and writing and the things I'm learning (still have a long way to go myself) have opened my eyes and have made reading a little less enjoyable than it used to be.  I've actually discarded and abandoned books when the errors and weaknesses started to get in the way of the story; something I'd never experienced before.  I'm certain that if I went back and read Meyer's books today I would have this same problem.<br /><br />I can already appreciate more of the critics' points:  Bella is a bit empty-headed and vapid, her obsession with Edward (at cost of all other interests: friends, college, etc) is pretty unhealthy, Edward is controlling and kind of awful, and Bella getting everything in the end makes her a Mary Sue character.  I also recently read an entertaining blog called &#34;Reasoning with Vampires&#34; that highlights hundreds of grammar mistakes and writing problems from Meyer's books.  The blog is harsh and sometimes overly critical, but I did find it really interesting and I learned a lot.<br /><br />I also read something interesting by the woman who worked as the continuity editor on the Harry Potter books.  She talks about the important notes a book needs to hit to, well, be a hit.  Characterization, plot development, etc... but notes that if a book hits just one thing really well such as 'emotion' it can find an audience despite the flaws in the other categories.  She says this basically sums up Twilight.  It made a lot of sense to me, because I certainly was able to get caught up in the emotion of it and either not see or ignore the other problems.<br /><br />All that said, if these books hadn't seen such immense commercial success, they wouldn't have come under such close scrutiny, either.  I guess to sum up this update:  I can better understand where the critics are coming from, but I still admire the sheer accomplishment of having written a complete novel, let alone four, and don't begrudge Stephenie Meyer her success.  It will be interesting to see if she'll be able to filter through the vitriol and improve her writing over time.  I'll likely read whatever she serves up next.<br /><br />*** Original review below ***<br /><br />Reading all these one star reviews is totally killing my post Breaking Dawn buzz, y'all.<br /><br />--Please note:  this review contains spoilers, as most of the reviews here do.<br /><br />Bella's happily ever after is heart warming and tidy just like any other fairy tale you might enjoy from childhood, though with quite a bit more blood and (fade-to-black married) sex.  Many of these one star reviews criticize the happy ending, the early marriage, and motherhood in place of a college education, among various other complaints.  I'm suspecting these reviewers would be much happier with an independent Bella who marches off in her human form to get a Masters degree in Psychology before marrying Edward.  Or heck, not marrying Edward at all, and eschewing the idea of something so base and demeaning as becoming a wife or parent.  Though perhaps it's more the youth of the heroine that causes their lament.<br /><br />I however, like happy endings and am thrilled she gets to be a mother.  Many people I spoke to who were in &#34;Camp Jacob&#34; expressed their reason:  &#34;Because she could have a family with Jacob&#34;.  Well, surprise; she had a family with Edward.<br /><br />Yes, Jacob imprints on Bella's daughter, but because imprinting on babies/children had previously been introduced in the series, I didn't find this unsettling, a bit weird, yes, but not perverted or anything.  All this shouting about pedophilia is a little... intense for what really happens. Jacob makes it clear that it isn't a sexual thing at all while the object the affection is still so young.  Jacob imprinting on &#34;Nessie&#34; means they all stay a family, which is what Bella wanted all along.<br /><br />Which brings me to another common complaint:  Bella gets everything.  Goodness!  After fighting for it, tooth and nail, yes, she does.  Isn't that what makes most of us smile at the end of Cinderella?<br /><br />Some have suggested that having Jacob imprint on someone else would allow Bella to make a sacrifice by finally fully letting him go as well as remove that feeling some reviewers have that she gets everything.  I do see this point, and perhaps this happening would have made it a more critically acclaimed book, but as I was reading the story, I was fully involved in watching Bella's story unfold and these things did not negate my enjoyment of the book.<br /><br />As for the complaint that Bella should have gone to college first -- she has the rest of eternity to obtain as many degrees as she wants. So... shrug?<br /><br />For those worried about the impact this book may have on impressionable young teen fans, if you're allowing them to read the books at all (I know some parents aren't), why don't you read the book along with them and talk about the real life application of Bella's choices?  Of whether or not an extremely intense relationship with a vampire who watches you while you sleep would be a good idea in real life?  Sounds like a great excuse for some good conversation.<br /><br />One complaint I completely agree with: Bella names her daughter Renesmee, which is hard to read, hard to pronounce, and impossible to spell.  I'm amazed that made it past the editors.  I also found the ending anti-climactic; there really should have been a battle scene.<br /><br />Critics argue that you can't shout &#34;But it's fantasy&#34; to cover gaping plot holes.  Perhaps to a more critical, serious eye, plot holes exist and are bothersome.  But I truly was lost in Bella's story and as I read, very little jumped out as completely unreal or impossible to me.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book and consider this rating a 4.5 stars.<br /><br />Stephenie Meyer has been able to create characters that feel real.  I was able to lose myself in the story through all four books. While the first in the series is the best in my opinion, the characters remained almost tangible people that I cared about and rooted for throughout.<br /><br />Stephenie admitted herself that pleasing all of her fans would be impossible, but insisted that this was the story she wanted to write all along.

0394806220|4.0|This book is a quick (rhyming) runthough of the wonderful sounds Mr. Brown can do, starting with the prosaic (moo, moo, choo choo) to the obscure and absurd (a \\"goldfish kiss\\" (pip!) and a \\"hippopotomus chewing gum\\" (grum, grum, grum), those are just two examples).<br /><br />This book is short, which makes it great for early readers and for toddlers learning to talk, as well as for those hurry-through-bedtime days.<br /><br />It's also really interactive, so it's terrific for group storytimes, especially with more active little kids who don't just want to sit down quietly. Every page ends with the narrator asking if you can make that noise too - and trust me, they can.
031606792X|1.0|I have Stephenie's first 2 books, but decided to stop with that. What I saw,  was that she was a mediocre writer, writing in a genre that (right now)...is super popular...and the truth is....Ms. Meyer, just got lucky. She is not that good. Not only that, but her characters are so annoying! I found myself several times, wanting to kill Bella myself!<br />Truth is...I paged through Breaking Dawn, and only read a bit of it (about a 100 pages), and realized this one wasn't going to be any better...I did not buy it, nor did I finish it.<br />I think Ms. Meyer needs to realize that she could be a better writer if she only tried a bit harder, I mean...she does have potential...but I feel that she let all the hype get to her head and really is not putting her heart and soul in her books anymore.<br />MY advice...do not waste your money on this book, or any other book by her. There are FAR too many great books in this genre to read instead.<br />Good Luck!
0394800389|4.0|This book is nothing more than a list of tongue twisters.    Each set of tongue twisters gets progressively harder and harder (not to mention more and more disastrous in the illustrations) until Mr. Knox throws his hands up in frustration, and it all starts over again.    Definitely read it before you read it aloud! I'd also recommend this book for the late stage of early readers - the words are just simple enough for them to actually be able to read them, while the wordplay is tricky enough to make it a really fun challenge.    There are a few minor concerns. First of all, the fox really is a nasty character, and uses language that I know some parents object to - calling Mr. Knox dumb, that sort of thing. And of course it shows some violence in the tweedle beetle battle.    This sort of thing doesn't concern me, but if it does concern you, as always, read before you buy.
031606792X|3.0|Breaking Dawn is, while a satisfactory conclusion to the story of Bella and Edward, not particularly necessary to the series overall.<br /><br />At the end of Eclipse, we were left with a hope for a promising future with Bella and Edward, and while the fact that she hadn't been bitten yet was troublesome, who truly could doubt that it would happen? With Breaking Dawn, Meyer brings us back to our favorite characters, but it wasn't such a happy reunion for me.<br /><br />I admit, that I enjoyed seeing the reaction of Charlie to Bella's wedding, and there were many revelations that enriched the story as a whole. But writing an entire novel to fit these things in seemed superfluous. Overall, I found much of the book melodramatic and slightly annoying and I believe that these things could have just as easily been incorporated into a short story or two; and would made it a much more enjoyable read.<br /><br />What Breaking Dawn lacked, compared to the other novels, was real substance and conflict. While I have never read the Twilight books for their intriguing plots (which are quite predictable at times), they still have included major dilemmas for characters I loved. There was also strong motivation for the choices the characters made, and the actions that they did. In this installment, however, all major conflict was resolved nearly within the first half of the book.<br /><br />Much of the last half of the book is spent describing preparation for a major event that ultimately amounts to nothing.<br /><br />All in all, I think that this last book was just a piece of fluff that, while it happily ends the series, was not quite necessary.
0689878451|4.0|So, let's clear it up at the start for all of you who may be shocked, shocked I say, at the content.    This is a story about a same-sex penguin couple and their adopted chick. It's a true story. This behavior is actually pretty common in the non-human world. If this disturbs you, hit the back button on your browser now.    *waits*    Okay, now, for the rest of you. There are two ways of dealing with a \\"controversial\\" topic. You can put it in the background, normalizing it, or you can make it the focus. This book chose the latter option.    I was a little worried that the text of the book might be too stuffy, because, after all, it's an \\"issues\\" book, right?    I was wrong.    It really is well-written, as just what it is - a sweet story about two penguins in love who really want a little chick of their own. It's not heavy handed, it's not overdone, it's perfect. (And, bonus, my nieces both loved pointing out the animal clock by the zoo. We stop by there every time we're in the area, because I used to stop by there with my dad. Nice connection for NYC families!)    I definitely recommend this book for anybody who is not against the message of \\"Love makes a happy family\\". (Or the other message of \\"Penguins are really cute.\\")

Before I knew it, I had blown through a book that gave me ideas of how to be a more competent person, parent, pet owner.  It moved quickly, always holding my interest. I had to reread the last chapter because the book is one of those that you don't necessarily want to end the way it does, but you know it will. So you race to the end in order to get it over with, only to reread the ending to make sure you didn't miss any fine points. Save yourself a couple chunks of time to read the book.

031606792X|2.0|Just be on alert: This review will have spoilers in it. I'll try to keep them to a minimum. Also, I would have given it 3 stars (well really 3.5 but that's not an option) but it wasn't until after I posted that I realized I clicked 2, and it cannot be changed.    Now, I am not a big fan of writing reviews, but I just couldn't pass up this opportunity. Breaking Dawn. I just don't even know how to describe what I thought of it. This book felt out of place in the series. As a book alone, it was great. Yet, it felt, I don't know, as if it were written by a different author. Or maybe it felt like it was written about different characters--characters that just seem to have the same names as the ones in the previous books of the series.     After I read Twilight, I felt like I was in a daze. The time I spent by myself driving, after reading Twilight but before I read New Moon, was consumed with everything Twilight. Edward. Edward and Bella. What the next two books, and eventually the final one, would hold. I just couldn't help reliving scenes in my head. How much love radiated from Edward. How much love Bella felt for him. It was indescribable, but Meyer did her best.    New Moon was a whole new ball park of emotions. Pain, agony, ripping, slowly healing in a new way. Then, finally, Edward was back. That made the book worth it. I looked at New Moon as a connecting book. Just something meant to pass time so that Jacob could be developed.    Then Eclipse came along. I was satisfied with the book. After all, it still has another one coming, so there are some questions that just won't be answered. Bella grew to be utterly annoying, but I got over it. Maybe she'd finally grow up. Eclipse was a great continuing story. I finished the first 3 books back to back to back and turned on my patience light while I waited for Breaking Dawn. Eager. Ridiculously eager. Can't stop thinking about these books eager. Enough so that I convinced numerous friends to read the books, just so I could talk about the series with them. Breaking Dawn couldn't get here fast enough.    And now, Breaking Dawn was finally in my hands. Maybe waiting long enough for the high to wear away had something to do with it. Maybe reading other series between the months I waited took its toll. Who am I kidding? That's not it. All I could think of while I was reading was, \\"Seriously, this book is meant to go along with this series, right?\\" Something about this book didn't fit right. I had flown through the first 3 books. Finally, another series I could get into! This book, not so much. I finished it the day after I got it, but it wasn't a can't-put-it-down-to-eat read.     I will say that the beginning seemed to flow kind of normally. I was so surprised to see that Bella choosing Edward had actually played out and in the first chapter, even! Then the book just turned weird on me. I know, I know. It a fantasy novel about a girl who falls in love with a VAMPIRE! Still, this was weird. Pregnancy from a vampire? I thought Meyer's vampires couldn't.. well... biologically.. do that. I mean, that can't even produce tears for crying out loud! (No pun intended.) Then, we have a 3rd of the story told from Jacob's POV, and all of the sudden, when it shifts back to Bella's POV, Jacob has become a background type of character! Then there is Alice, sweet bubbly Alice. She hardly gets much in this book! I missed her. Rosalie gets more say than she does. I just don't get it. The book was, well, okay. I did like it, just not as much as I wish I had. No where near as much as the other 3. I kept looking at the amount I had left to read thinking, \\"What else is going to happen? Bella is a vampire already, so what conflict is going to take place?\\" When the conflict did arrive, it wasn't much a conflict at all. More of a mind battle than a physical battle. I was glad it was somewhat unexpected. It had a happy ending, which I did appreciate. If you want a real one, go read non-fiction. The problem was,the happy ending wasn't earned. There was no sacrifice. No one had to give up anything. There was a thought of it, but that's it. Ah, well, its done now.     I can finish this book and honestly continue on as if the series was just another series I read. Not exactly a favorite, not exactly a waste of time. I am not even THINKING much about it, like I had after the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd ones. Take this as you can. Sorry the review was so long, but I had to get it all out.

I mean, if this were some college course, the book would have been $75.00 and I'd feel like I'd finally gotten a book I was going to keep.<br /><br />I couldn't even describe how detailed this book is.  I feel like I can actually do this figure thing.  I mean, every step is laid out for you.  Every SINGLE step.  There is nothing left to the imagination, no question left unanswered.  I mean, there are instructions within instructions within variations of instructions...  How to sculpt different ethnic groups, the male figure, the female figure, the musculature, the hands--how to make your own eyeballs, for heaven's sake!  Katherine Dewey shows that you can make every single tool you'll use, which I still haven't done yet, but need to do since I think most of her handmade tools are better than the ones I could buy.<br /><br />I don't think I could really adequately express my excitement over having this book.  I have so desired for so long to be able to sculpt figures that were beautiful and believable, and I feel like I can finally do it!
031606792X|2.0|i have been absolutely in love with these books for the past two years. Ive reread the books over and over, sometimes right after i've finished them. I can't say i'll really want to reread this book more than once. This really depresses me because it puts a taint on the entire series.   The beginning was perfect the wedding the honeymoon, it was all good.  I got annoyed though that it was becoming to be all about sex. And that it was completely skipped over. Now i dont mean i want to hear all the gruesome details, but we've all enjoyed the sweet sort of foreplay they've had in the first three books. Where were the declarations of love and all that jazz? well not in this book, instead bella and edward give each other the sex look and hey its morning already!  the baby, just a bad idea. the name even worse. and her power yeah not that great either. i hated how the book became all about bella and the baby it was supposed to be about her and edward and her sacrificing everything. including having children. Edward hardly had a rle in it other than just watching bella.  i was glad at least that she became a vampire, but i wanted to see the struggle it should've been, how it would affect bella and edwards relationship. Instead shes great right off the bat, she already has the control not to attack nearby humans and run away. this was the most disappointing. I wanted to know more being a vampire. instead i got stuck with trying to figure out what the kid was. and Bella wasn't bella at all i could barely recognize her, her character was just so different in this book, it wasn't the bella i've known for three books.  i enjoyed jacobs take of the events and his section in the book. He was a little more real and stuck to his character, until he imprinted on bella and edwards kid. it doesnt weird me out that she was a baby at all, it was that it was their kid. plus after that he got kinda wimpy.  i enjoyed reading about all the new vampires it was interesting reading about the vampires and their powers. i didn't mind bella's either really. the end was good for the most part, a little too sugar coated, it seems so fake when everything works out perfectly, no losses or sacrifices, just happily ever after.    so now im going to go read some Harry Potter because JK Rowling really knows how to end a series. I got everything i hoped for in that book. As for breaking dawn all i got was bella became a vampire.... the end
031606792X|1.0|I cried, not tears of joy mind you but tears of confusion and frustration!  What happened?  How can you take an Epic romance you have spent 3 books building, developing and throw it away within the first 300 pages of book 4?  Sure Bella and Edward end up together in the end but by then does it even matter?  Their love has lost all dignity and respect and is no longer Epic even by the loosest definition.   The entire love story that was Edward and Bella is torn apart from the beginning and never pieced back together. Sure by the end of the book we are made all too aware that they find each other physically attractive but what about all the emotional turmoil they faced at the beginning of the book, where was the resolution.  Was the message sex fixes everything?  I understand wanting to tie the neat bow and happily ever after but if we lose all respect and feeling toward your characters on the way there`s no point.  I loved the first 3 books and it made reading this that much harder.  At some points I was forcing myself   to continue not wanting to continue.  This book is truly chaos and confusion, less about the characters and more about getting to say Happily Ever After at the end.    ***Parents please think twice about letting your children read this, many of the themes in this book are very adult and some of the descriptions are very disturbing.***
0307346617|2.0|First, this is not a novel -- it's a book made up of vignettes, so there's no real plot or character development.  Second, it's highly focused on policies and strategies -- it reminded me of my husband's Army War College textbooks.  If that's your idea of engrossing/interesting reading, you'll enjoy this book!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Stein does a great job seeing life through the dogs eyes, you forget a person wrote it. The story is captivating from the first page. It is about love, friendship, life's curveballs and taking life on with a winning spirit. It is a quick read that will make you laugh, cry and smile. This unique book is a joy to read, even if you have never had a dog. But if you have, you'll never look at them the same way, or it will confirm what you always knew.
031606792X|1.0|First of all, where was the Edward and Bella romance that we got in Twilight? I couldn't find it. His character was almost nonexistent. The wedding was too rushed, the honeymoon... not a single intimate conversation. Not really one. About what it was like to be married, how they finally felt about everything that had gotten them to this point, what they hoped for the future, nothing. I felt cheated.    Then the pregnancy... just yuck, how Bella lit up every time Jake came over, meanwhile, Edward's going out of his mind and she seems to just not address that. Did it not occur to her how it would make Edward feel when she did stuff like that with Jake? Her constant disregard for his feelings never ceased to amaze me. And we're supposed to like her for this?    I have to admit, I loved the delivery scene, with Edward having to deliver the baby and her just spewing blood from everywhere. Too bad Jake was there, but it was impossible to shake him, thanks Steph. If they ever make a movie of this one, I want to see that scene.    I must say, I have read better transformation scenes in fanfiction. That was weak, but, I like Bella as a vamp much better than as a human. It really helped that she finally cut Jake loose and realized she belonged to Edward. Finally! It took her becoming a vamp for that to happen? How stupid was she as a human?    Then the imprinting. Just weird and creepy. Almost incestuous; just a few days earlier, Jacob is having fantasies about having sex with Bella. Then suddenly, he wants her daughter. Creeped me out big time. Why couldn't he imprint on Angela or even Tanya?    Oh, I know why, because it wouldn't have fit into the whole bizarro ending she had planned, with the wolves intimidating the Volturi. I did like Seth though; if anyone had to imprint on the kid, I wished it was him. I also thought Sam would die so Jake would have to become Alpha. But, no, nobody has to die in Stephenie's little dream world except for evil Irina, who was simply mistaken and jumped to the wrong conclusion. Off with her head.    Oh yeah, I loved how Jake took it upon himself to go tell Charlie, just to keep them from going out of town for a few months. How selfish can you be? How inconsiderate? Just another example of how he disrespects Bella's decisions. Still supposed to be her best friend and still unable to be supportive. If he couldn't stand the separation, why didn't he just go with them? They weren't going to the moon.    I hate Renesmee but I like it better than Nessie. Couldn't they have called her Rennie.. or what about sticking Elizabeth in there somewhere for Edward's mother? But nothing tops Edward Jacob. I almost barfed. I'm sure Edward wanted to name his son that. What was Stephenie on when she wrote this???    I was never worried that E and B wouldn't end up together. She's not THAT stupid. But I didn't see the baby or the imprinting coming. I thought we resolved the love triangle in Eclipse, but at the reception, there it was again. I wanted to scream and I wanted to slap Bella, and therefore, Stephenie. Jake is hugging her, so Edward comes back and Jake's stink is all over her Wedding Dress. Funny, it occurred to me but it didn't occur to Bella. She's always so worried about hurting Jake but she doesn't seem to worry about hurting Edward.    The only time she did seem to consider his feelings was when she was trying to hide her own pain, with the pregnancy and the transformation. The only time. She could hang onto Jake all she wanted with never a backward glance in Edward's direction. Did Stephenie do that on purpose or did she just think that was acceptable behavior? Is she completely insensitive?    Talk about a big build up with no climax... let's just chit chat with Aro and then glare at each other and then they'll turn around and go back to Italy. Yeah, that's a great ending; what a let down.    And a love shield? Yeah, I like Lily Potter too, but I would try to come up with something original for my fourthnovel, not something that's already been done by JK Rowling. And since when was Bella's love her strongest human trait? Her closed mind, yes, love shield, no.
031606792X|5.0|This book was incredible and impossible to put down.  What an emotional ride.  I never expected it to take the twists and turns that it did, but I'm so glad that it did.  Stephanie Meyer, you have a true gift and please never stop writing.  I can't believe the negaitve reviews.  For those who are critical of the character of Bella and calling Stephenie anti-feminist, because she allows Bella to get married and have a child give me a break.  This book is a fantasy book, since when do vampires exist and when do they go to college.  If I wanted real life I'd watch the news.  This book is true fantasy and makes you believe in happily ever after.  I will read it again and enjoy it again just as much.  This series was just amazing and I hope Stephanie continues to write more about the Cullens.
031606792X|5.0|Now that the saga is over, and I've had some time to digest, I can unequivocally say that I did not expect the story to play out exactly as it did... but who would, really? However, I can't deny that I definitely saw some of it (a lot of it) coming. Some of the issues people seem to have with the plot twists seem blatantly obvious to me, so I wanted to post some of my own theories on why SM resolved things the way she did in Breaking Dawn. Given, these are simply my interpretations of why I didn't find every twist out of place, and I could be completely wrong.    1) How come Bella is suddenly okay with being a wife and mother, when she was so abhorred to the idea before?    I think, for Bella, like a lot of people, you can't imagine yourself in these roles until you are. And what's more, for Bella, she especially can't because of her mother's warnings about marriage and because she thinks it's impossible to have children with Edward anyway. Not to mention she's only 18. But that doesn't mean that she is incapable of fulfilling these roles, she just has to mature into them.    The marriage issue was already discussed, in Eclipse, when Bella explained it as nearly a formality in her mind-a way to make Edward happy. But, in the end, it was fitting for her to want to become Edward's wife because it meant she was prepared to dedicate her human life to him, literally. It was a necessary step in the novel to show that she was ready to abandon her human ways (worrying about what other humans would think about her early marriage, for example). She gave herself to Edward as a human, through the typical human method-marriage, before giving herself to him as a vampire.    Her reaction to being pregnant did not seem far-fetched, either. If anything, it went along with the stories of how most women feel when they realize they are carrying another human life inside of them. And how even more miraculous for Bella when she thought it was impossible! Is it really a surprise that sheimmediately wants to protect it? I think it's unfair to assume that Bella would immediately be terrified and beside-herself. Yes, she's young, but not THAT young. I find it funny that people think it's okay for Bella to decide to become a vampire for all eternity, but then she's clearly way too young to handle maternity. Bella at 18 isn't your typical 18 year-old, and readers should know that.    2) Why and how does Bella get pregnant?    The why part of the question seems obvious. After what Rosalie told her in Eclipse, this seemed a natural plot development. Bella has everything that Rose does not, a big part being the ability to conceive. If Bella were robbed of this chance, I think many, including Stephenie (who is a mother) would see it as a tragedy that she missed such a monumental human experience. It might not be what many readers wanted for Bella, but it's no surprise that SM took it there.    The how part is a little less clearly defined, but let's thank SM for not getting into all the gory details of vampiric male anatomy, shall we? Although, to me, the provided explanation is pretty clear. Edward is frozen, as he was when he was first created into a vampire. Therefore, like all men, at any adult age, he has the ability to reproduce, because for men fertility is constant, unlike women. And though Edward's body is technically dead (his heart doesn't beat, he doesn't have normal human processes, etc.) it still functions in its frozen state. And interestingly, so do sperm, as science has found ways to preserve human sperm to be used at a later time by \\"freezing\\" them. So is it so unbelievable that Edward is physically able to impregnate Bella? Maybe it's a stretch, but I think since this is fiction, why not?    3) Why does Renesmee grow at an accelerated pace?    This question also jumped out to me on the message boards as having a clear answer. Renesmee is linked to Jacob in BD, perhaps having a similar genetic make-up because she is a \\"half-breed,\\" as Alice puts it. She's hot to the touch, she is unable to be forseen in Alice's visions, and she might even have 24 chromosomes. Interestingly, like Jacob, she grows at an accelerated rate and then plateaus at a mature state. Think of Jacob's transformation into a werewolf in New Moon. It seemed that by the day he was getting bigger, and every time Bella saw him, he had grown several inches. This is exactly like Renesmee, throughout Bella's pregnancy and in her childhood.    4) Why does Jacob imprint on Renesmee?    So, it might seem a little creepy, but as soon as you knew there was a potential for Bella's offspring, of course Jacob would imprint! He wasn't meant to be with Bella, or he would have imprinted on her originally. But he loves Bella, maybe innately because he saw in her so many qualities that his eventual soul mate would have. Plus, since Renesmee is genetically more like Jacob, we can presume that she is a better candidate for reproduction of werewolves. And SM couldn't leave heartbroken Jacob for all eternity. He had to find his match, and if it weren't Bella, who else would readers have settled for? (I mean, not that they seem to be settled with Renesmee either, it's just the lesser of two evils)    5) How come Bella doesn't go through the normal \\"newborn\\" phase?    This was an unpredicted plot twist, but I don't think SM just did it because it was convenient for Bella not to always be thinking about drinking blood. She could have accelerated through that part of Bella's story and ended up with the same essential plot. But, isn't it interesting how Renee always told Bella how she came out of the womb a fully mature adult? She had wisdom beyond her years as a human, and so it was the same with her vampire birth. Bella is mature by nature, and that maturity, whether it be a superpower or not, meant that she was able to better handle the temptations of \\"childhood,\\" if you will.    6) Why is Bella's special power a shield?    Okay, people who have complained about this have me baffled! What did you expect? We already knew Bella could shield herself from Edward, the Volturi, etc, and Aro even speculated in Breaking Dawn how interesting it would be to see the power manifest itself when she became immortal. Duh. The ability to project her powers on others was unpredicted, but if she simply could just do the same thing she could do as a human, what fun would that be? For all of Bella's insecurities about her human existence-her awkwardness and accident-prone ways-it makes sense that her power as a vampire should be something rewarding and powerful. And, Bella, being the martyr she is, even in human-form, would of course devise a way to protect the ones she loved, and that is exactly why her shield developed as it did.    Like I said, the plot is not hole-proof, but it's not swiss cheese either. I think there are a lot of obvious answers to many questions that SM might not have put down on paper, but that doesn't mean she didn't think through them. I'm curious to hear others speculations about these and other issues they had with the book!
B0006L0LOS|3.0|This is a totally watchable movie, I love the origin of catwoman and some of the cgi effects, cat movements etc... Specially the fight in the jewelry store.  I just hated the corny dialogue ex. \\"It's overtime!\\"  Corny!!!<br /><br />I agree a better villain could have been better, but Sharon did a good job.  I love Sharon.  Maybe if she were a sci fi villain instead of a normal person with a face of marble.  Anyway, there are worse things in this movie:<br /><br />Editing, don't know if it was the directors fault but I hate choppy movies ex. Moulin Rouge etc...<br /><br />Soundtrack, horrible. I hate the whole pussycat doll wailing in the background.  Would have been better just classical film soundtrack.<br /><br />Costume, the mask was ugly, the pants were ok I guess don't like the bell bottom look.  I agree with others that the costume she wore at the jewelry store was much better.  I liked seeing her hair and the mask was cute.<br /><br />So finally her acting.  It was great, you people associate everything horrible in the movie with her but it's not her fault.  Her acting was not bad at all.  The dialogue and corny lines are the faults.  But again not all her lines were bad.<br /><br />She had the cool right cat attitude.  Her movements were great, specially when she wakes up from death, just like a cat watching and playing with something.  Her changes from geek to cool to bad were right on and her emotions were shown when needed.<br /><br />So my challenge to the makers in hollywood is to give Catwoman another chance.  Do a remake like the hulk with Halle even.  Or make her play Catwoman in the next Batman movie, she deserves a chance.<br /><br />Same thing for Mr. Freeze, re do him and make us forget Arnold playing him.  :-)
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm often surprised at the poor reviews this series gets from 'Sci-Fi addicts'.  I more often find that people complain about the setting, or specifically call out Joss Whedon rather than focusing on the show itself.  So, before anyone goes too far off the mark, let's call a few things to light.    First, it's Joss Whedon.  The show is meant to be campy to a degree, and the show is meant to be enjoyable and generally light with a present but contained darker side.  Look at his other work in TV - much of it fits this bill, with only a bit of variation.    Second, it's a western... in space.  Period.  It's not supposed to be the evolution of man, the pioneering of new worlds, or societal fall-backs to an older time.  It's treated like a standard western moved into a space setting.  It's also Sci-Fi, so don't expect anything less and enjoy the combined oddities space and westerns add together.    Third, the characters develop over time. They're not transparent, and those that have reviewed and talked about poor character development certainly haven't watched the show enough.  I've gone through the series once, and have quite a bit of detail about each character involved (save one, who is purposefully left in a hazy background).    Fourth, the plot lines may not be the most original, but they each have their own twists.  With the amount of western material out there, I don't expect much new on that front, so transferring it to space only present limited options to expand.  However, each plot line was delivered well, and has enough personal flavor to stand alone.    If people have a problem with the plot or the acting, it's all based on personal preference at that point.  I personally thought the plot was fine, and the actors did a respectable job.  My main reason for such high marks was the enjoyment factor - the series was Whedon staple, enjoyable content with humor and camp appropriately inserted.  I enjoy a good laugh, and as long as I'm laughing with the series andnot at it, I call that successful.  And while I don't know that this show would be winning any particular awards for the series, it certainly fits my bill for a repeatable enjoyment factor - something I'll definitely watch again in the future when I need a light-hearted laugh.
031606792X|5.0|I was very nervous about how this seies would wrap up and I can honestly say that I was shocked and amazed at how it concluded. I loved it and will read it over and over.
031606792X|2.0|LONG SO BEWARE!<br /><br />I really need to vent since some of my friends haven't finished it yet..<br /><br />I'm 17 years old and I got hooked on the 'Twilight' series my sophomore year, 2006. I can not even begin to describe how the first book, 'Twilight,' made me feel. Stephenie Meyer gave me everything I could ever want in a book: romance, comedy, sarcasm, drama, action.. all wrapped up into one! Since then, I couldn't get enough of the book. I've probably read it 5-7 times; it's even made my top 3 items to take to a deserted island!<br /><br />I guess you can say I'm a big fan. I wouldn't say I'm a die-hard fan.. I was absolutely amazed and captivated by the book.<br /><br />With 'New Moon,' it left me with mixed emotions. I understand that Meyer wanted to show readers how Bella and Edward would cope without being together 24/7. I felt her pain but Bella started to annoy me.<br /><br />In 'Eclipse,' I think this was when the series started to pick up some more. There was definitely more action later towards the end and I really did feel once again, the struggle Bella faced in choosing Edward or Jacob. However, I believed she was being so selfish in this book and that part of Bella made me like the character less and less. STILL LOVED EDWARD, HATED JACOB.<br /><br />Ah, the series comes to an end with 'Breaking Dawn!' I have been waiting ever since I finished the third book. I even attended the midnight release party at Barnes and Noble. I woke up early in the morning to get my wristband as well.. Dedicated much? YES. Went home, started to read it and I will admit, the first two books were fine with me. I did, however, feel that the story was getting rushed, not everything was being thoroughly explained, a trait of Meyer's writing I admired so much. I knew Bella and Edward would have 'done it' already but like others, I was  amazed how crazy sex had made the two! Not a good message to be sending out to tweens and teens...<br /><br />As I have mentioned earlier, I said that I hated Jacob. Reading Jacob's perspective totally refreshed the book for me because I seriously need to get away from Bella's stupid antics and melodramatic talk. Jacob is seriously not as dumb as he looks or makes himself out to be. He has complete and somewhat complicated thoughts. He is outrageously hilarious; the titles of his chapters were TO DIE FOR! Jacob stayed the most sane to me out of all the characters and I could still feel the same Jacob we were all introduced to three books earlier. I also found it difficult to read some parts because I felt his agony and how hard it must have been to see the love of his life suffer for a baby she never intially wanted and to turn into a vampire! For once, I felt horrible that Bella put Jacob through this. I really wanted to dive more into Jacob's character but sadly.. it ends and goes back to Bella's POV.<br /><br />Wow, the rest of the book just goes downhill for me. Once the vampires find out about the Volturi and their plan, everything begins to build to the climax but when it finally comes.. NOTHING HAPPENED! I was waiting for a freaken epic battle scene to end the series but instead, I got a bunch of scared legendary vampires who run away because they see living proof of vampire hybrids. Can I say crappy ending?!<br /><br />The last chapter I was reminded of why I loved and stayed with the series for all these years. I replayed all the romantic scenes between Bella and Edward that made readers ALIKE grow to love and care for... I was happy to see that Edward could finally see into Bella's mind. That, I was able to handle. Everything else in the book just made me dislike it even more.<br /><br />Overall, the message and themes of the book addresses many issues that today teenagers and young adults deal with: finding and keeping love, having sex, getting pregnant, possibility of abortion, getting an education.. I could go on but they're all pretty negative to me.<br /><br />I read some of the other reviews and I agree with most of the negative reviews. There was no reality in this book. Everything was too neat and 'sweet.' I have a sweet tooth and all but this was just too much! After reading it, I probably got cavitites.. It was that bad.<br /><br />The thing I loved the most about Meyer was the way she characterized the people she wrote about in her book. Everyone could find someone they could relate to. Everyone could feel how they felt. BUT.. 'Breaking Dawn' failed to shine Meyer's characterization. The characters, ALL OF THEM, were so boring and I felt as if they weren't the same ones from the previous books. Bella made me cringe and I was still annoyed.. my favorite character, Edward, was barely mentioned! When he was, he was either refusing than wanting sex or constantly worrying about his newborn wife. I missed him so much. There was no romance in this book and I bet I can speak for everyone that this is why so many people have fell in love with the book.<br /><br />I will applaud Meyer for putting in Jacob's POV because I started to like him because I was able to understand him better. But the imprinting thing 'THE UNMENTIONABLE' was just plain creepy and disgusting to me. Jacob got the short end of the stick and that was totally unfair.<br /><br />THE WHOLE BABY PLOT WAS LAME. LAME LAME LAME. I couldn't believe Meyer chose to head into this direction with the most anticipated novel of this year so far. The name, RENEESME CARLIE, was the most ludicrous and bloodcurdling name I have ever heard in my entire life. I had no idea how to pronounce it and the nickname made it even worse... 'Nessie.' *shivers* I wanted there to be something with the immortal children! When that chapter came when Bella had a nightmare about a immortal child and a pile of drained bodies, I actually thought this would be the plot. Bella and Edward make a mutated baby spawn and it would become evil and kill everything! But instead, I got a beautiful and extraordinary intelligent baby girl who dazzled everyone. WOW. WOW IS ALL I CAN SAY.<br /><br />I can't say anything else now.. I think I got it all out of my system.<br /><br />I agree, I should have stopped at 'Eclipse' and made up my own ending for the series. It sure would have been much better than what Meyer came up with. But hey, read it and decide for yourself.<br /><br />'Breaking Dawn' ruined probably my favorite series (next to Harry Potter) of all time.<br /><br />I will never get over this...this book.

B00003CXD5|5.0|The great director John Huston made many wonderful classic films like \\"The Maltese Falcon\\", \\"The Africain Queen\\", \\"Prizzi's Honor\\" & \\"The Man Who Would Be King\\" (he intended as a vehicle for Gable & Bogart but both had passed and Connery and Caine were chosen) but none can compare to this all time top 10 classic!!  Though Walter Huston won for Best Supporting Actor, many felt that Bogie was robbed of his Best Actor Oscar for which he was compensated years later for \\"The Africain Queen\\".  His performance ranging from being proud to outright paranoia is a masterpiece of acting that was only equalled by his portrayal of Captain Queeg, several years later.  Along with another classic Western set in Mexico, \\"The Wild Bunch\\", this film belongs in the all-time top 10!!

0393324818|5.0|I love sports.  I love business, finance, and statistics.  I've never been a baseball fan.  This book was very well written to appeal to a very broad audience with a wide variety of backgrounds on the topic.  The principle observations are delivered through expert story telling around very compelling central figures.    Without flowery language or paragraph after paragraph of adjectives - Lewis recounts experiences and conversations with such clarity that you can almost see, smell, and hear the scenes unfolding.    I won't look at baseball or the exploitation of market inefficiencies the same after having read this book.  I'd recommend this book to anyone with intellectual curiosity.
031606792X|3.0|First all I loved the first three books, I only liked this one.  There were parts I liked a lot, but some I was rolling my eyes wondering what SM was thinking.  There is too much crammed into the book and I feel like we lost Bella and Edward's relationship.  I mean I know there are married now, but it just seemed different.  I would have never guessed the plot line in a million years.  I don't mind that she was able to get pregnant, but I wish everything wasn't so rushed, like the wedding and honeymoon.  It seems like there was more passion in Eclipse (bed scene) than on the honeymoon.  I mean we know they had sex many times in the book and liked, but there was no build up.  I didn't expect details, but there as no foreplay other than the commentary before or after (like the black night grown didn't make and the headboard or I have a better idea to work off calories).      I liked how Alice and Jasper saved the day, that made me happy.  I am going to re-read the book.  I did read it very fast the first time, so I am hoping to like better the 2nd time around.
031606792X|4.0|The following review contains spoilers.  Read at your own risk.    I've been a Twilight fan since around 2006, so I'm not new to the series.  I've read all of the previous books multiple times and waited a year for Breaking Dawn to be released.  I had very high expectations for Breaking Dawn, simply because after falling in love with the other books I believed it could only get better.  A few days before release I read some of the spoilers, and at first I was pretty much like Edward when he found out about Bella's pregnancy: a catatonic state of shock.    Although I still thoroughly enjoyed the book and warmed up to the storyline, it did not feel like the same series.  Many of the characters were acting out of character, and some of the plot lines were unnecessary or plain nonsensical.  I felt that Nessie was created purely for the purpose of giving the Volturi a reason to return(which ended up being very anti-climatic anyway) and a stepping-off point for future Twilight-related novels.  The other books made it very clear that Bella and Edward were not the parenting type, but then all of sudden Bella LOVES her unborn child and is ready to take on motherhood and give up her independence at the age of 18.  I feel that the book does not send a good message to younger readers, and although Stephenie stated that this was how it was meant to end from the start, I feel there are other ways she could've created a happy ending without sacrificing the integrity and meaning of the previous three books.
031606792X|4.0|As a 37 year old whose fascination with Vampire fiction was revived with \\"Twilight,\\" I have the say that all of the criticism regarding Stephenie Meyer's latest installment in the Twilight series is totally unwarranted.<br /><br />\\"Breaking Dawn,\\" is a good read, somewhat like \\"New Moon,\\" and it deserves some applause.<br /><br />Just like any 18 year old faces a new chapter in their lives, \\"Breaking Dawn\\" portrays \\"Bella\\" as having turned a new corner in her life.<br /><br />It does leave some ends untied, but as we all know, unanswered questions make for a great sequel.<br /><br />My take on it? The book is great, and doesn't deserve to get slammed.
031606792X|5.0|A lot of people are upset with Breaking Dawn because it did not regurgitate out some generally anticipated endings.  To me, that was great.  I never saw the next page coming.  I would have preferred this to actually be split into two books, because it needs it.  The book as is, however, is an emotional roller-coaster that just leaves you drained by the time you finish it, because you've spent the last however many hours laughing, crying, and cheering.  To me, this book far surpasses anything Meyer has written before - but then again, I was only mildly impressed by Twilight.  The two books are very different, and fans of Twilight are likely to be disappointed with the style and plot of Breaking Dawn - specifically the younger readers who are not going to to understand the dynamics of a married relationship.  For older readers, though, Bella becomes someone we can really identify with in this book.  It was great!
031606792X|1.0|I was totally disappointed in this book. None of the action and suspense that was in the first three made it into this book. It felt like the after thought it probably was. I am very disappointed as I feel the author/publisher was just going for the $MONEY$ on this book. How disappointing. I am so disgusted with the book I won't see any of the movie or read any future works by an artist who sold us (her fans) out.
031606792X|2.0|(spoilers below)<br /><br />I have always taken these books for what they are: not particularly groundbreaking literature, but a nonetheless enjoyable, poofy read. They are hilariously bad in some parts and extremely engrossing in others. S. Meyer is what she is, a novice writer who happened to choose to write about pretty vampires. So with the release of Breaking Dawn, I didn't have any kind of grandiose notions that this book would change my life or alter my way of thinking about the world. I was expecting an enjoyable read that would hopefully tie up some loose ends in the series, leaving me satisfied and able to move on in my life after weaning myself off the crack that these books are obviously laced with.<br /><br />Yes, Breaking Dawn tied things up. But satisfied is definitely NOT the word I would use to describe my mood upon completion.<br /><br />Ultimately it's difficult for me to move beyond the insanely weird pregnancy plotline. I expected a happy wedding, a honeymoon full of just-hinted-at, ahem, relations, some Jake angst, some Volturi showdown. But throw in a half-vampire, half-human superchild and you're left with some very confused readers.<br /><br />I was also annoyed with the total lack of attention paid to human characters who were, in other books, at least pretty vital secondary characters. Angela's pop performed the ceremony, Mike caught the garter, Bella disappears into her happy sunset and never speaks to her old friends again? Really? I know she can't stand wasting her time with lowly humans, but come on. We needed some resolution there. Renee was also, as always, totally neglected by the daughter who, we're told, used to have to remind her to breathe throughout the day. Does Bella really miss her at all?<br /><br />The biggest disappointment, however, was the Volturi showdown. Half the book leads up to it, with the arrival of the new vampires (all interesting but, as usual, totally underdeveloped as characters), the preparations for the fight, the exploration of the different powers possessed by the new vampires, etc. Alice's leaving was a good surprise, Bella's preparing for her own death was intriguing, but when it came time for the ultimate battle, we were given... nothing. A peaceful resolution thanks to Alice's deus ex machina where everyone talked it out rationally and calmly and the Volturi retreated to their creepy towers in Italy.<br /><br />Yes, it sends a good message: violence doesn't have to be the answer. But does it make for an interesting read? Absolutely not. I wanted a huge battle sequence to put Eclipse's newborn fight to shame. I wanted werewolves going at the Volturi like mad dogs, I wanted Emmett ripping things to pieces, I wanted Bella to use her newborn rage, I wanted to see all of these interesting powers put to use... but we got nothing. Alice popped in, offered up a random Brazillian kid, and the Volturi are all, \\"O nvm then. Our bad!\\"<br /><br />And Bella lived happily ever after with her husband, baby, and baby's protector/brother/lover. This book was cop out after cop out after cop out.<br /><br />Seriously, Stephenie Meyer. What the hell?wers possessed by the new vampires, etc. Alice's leaving was a good surprise, Bella's preparing for her own death was intriguing, but when it came time for the ultimate battle, we were given... nothing.

0312427999|5.0|This book is a great starting point for those interested in the alternative, behind-the-scenes version of history over the past 35 years.  It tells about U.S. involvement in South America, particularly Argentina and Chile and how our government supported totalitarian regimes to further the Chicago School economic agenda; the ANC and apartheid Africa and why it failed; disaster capitalism's impact on Sri Lanka and Thailand after the tsunami; disaster capitalism's impact on New Orleans; and where disaster capitalists went wrong in their dealings in Iraq.<br /><br />Naomi Klein truly went above and beyond in creating a concise, accurate portrayal of what's been going on in the sidelines over the last few decades.  I'd be very interested to read her other book \\"No Logo\\" in the future.
031606792X|1.0|I guess the danger of writing the final book in such a popular series is that if by chance the author ruins that one book, the rest of an otherwise intriguing and inventive series is destroyed along with it. In Breaking Dawn, Stephenie Meyer truly rises to the challenge of tearing apart her entire series with that one final book. There will be no spoilers in this review so you need not read with caution. It is enough to say that in her final volume, Meyer bends and distorts the rules of her universe to such a degree to render that universe ridiculous. With its unbelievably absurd plot twists this book read like extremely poor fanfiction. It is slow throughout most of the book but picks up when the conflict finally presents itself almost 600 pages in. However, even the poorly constructed and anti-climactic conflict is not enough to save this warped fairytale book. The main characters fail to retain many of the characteristics that defined them in previous books which makes them seem very alien to the reader at times. The plot twists are few and far between in this overlong book and one in particular is downright creepy (not in a good way). When the reader does finally cross the finish line at the end of this reading marathon, the result is bitter disappointment that such a highly anticipated conclusion was ruined to such a degree. The reader can only hope that next time Meyer decides to write the ending of a hugely popular series, she will have better editors
1883010039|5.0|When my weaving friends aren't around, this is my weaving bible.  Great photos and text written in an easy-to-get manner.  She even suggests inexpensive ways to create some of the tools needed.  Sample patterns and suggested thread;  lots of good ideas and various ways to achieve the same thing.  Highly recommended.
B000XNZ7LG|5.0|This is one of the best WWII films I've seen, along with Schindler's List it really has a great  story and plot development.    It is a story of the horrors of nazi occupations and treatment of the Jews that needs to be told and learned, to know history is to not repeat it.
0765348276|3.0|An interesting premise. At first read I was ready to put the book aside but as I perservered it got better and better.  I will follow up the series.
031606792X|5.0|I just loved the fact that Meyer gave Bella and Edward a baby i was taken by surprise when reading it. When Jacob imprinted on Nessie i thought it was so funny but it made all sense in the world.     To many people  might think that bella was too young to have babies, but 18 that makes her adult and well meyer totally blew me away with this book. It might no the great as twilight but i think its cause the first book it was all about the chase that bella edward had, in this book they seem so grown up and different pppl and makes totally sense to me.
031606792X|5.0|I thought it was actually a really good ending. Sure it had its flaws, but it also had funny, sweet moments. As well as really suspenseful moments. Definitely would recommend this whole series to anyone.
031606792X|4.0|Yikes. There was so much negativity in the above reviews that I felt the need to defend this book--and its worldview--in a review of my own.    As a young woman, and a femalist (not a feminist), I found this book refreshing in its portrayal of the wife/mother Bella, and I was glad that Stephenie Meyer didn't give up her more traditionalist beliefs to appease a postmodern crowd.     Looking around at the broken marriages and the children neglected by their mothers for the sake of careerism and materialism in our world, perhaps it's time for our culture's heroines to re-embrace the traditional domestic roles of wife and mother, without neglecting to embrace their own unique strengths at the same time. This is something that Bella manages to do in Book 4.      Although some may complain that Bella is too young to make a good mother(though not young by our grandparents' reckoning, I must add), I'd like to point out the fact that motherhood ennobles and matures her character.  She has to think selflessly for once. She lays down her life for her child and her new family, while using her own unique gifts to help to save them. And in getting married in the first place, she gives up all of her human dreams for the companionship of a husband who adores her and will support her, no matter what, and with whom she now shares an equal relationship--a better life for her than she could have ever imagined.     It's also important to point out that being a wife and mother doesn't actually *define* Bella; rather, these roles strengthen her, test her, and challenge her.  She gains more positive qualities as these roles become a part of her life--qualities that add to the definition of who she is, rather than detract from it.  In fact, I'd hazard to say that, had Bella continued to simply date Edward and skipped the whole marriage/baby gig, she may have gotten perpetually 'stuck' in a selfish adolescent state when she became a vampire, limiting her own potential by going down a self-pleasing path.  Moreover, she might have deprived the world of the presence of a very unique individual born of her selfless choice, a miraculous little infant girl who very well might continue the series.    Bravo, Stephenie, for writing such a pro-family, pro-life, pro-marriage, and pro-selflessness novel at a time in which our culture embraces individualism at the expense of others.
031606792X|2.0|Last summer I walked into a book store and plucked a book off the shelf with an interesting looking cover. I read the summary out of curiosity and decided to give it a try. That book was Twilight. I devoured it. Edward Cullen gave me butterflies! I needed New Moon two days later when I had polished off the first book in the series. I was not disappointed. I loved the way Bella and Jacob's relationship grew and I loved that the reader fell in love with him the way she did. Slow and unexpectedly. I came to care about these characters and was sincerely interested in their happiness and futures. A month later Eclipse was released and again I became even more deeply involved with the story. I loved these characters and the relationships between them. I felt as though I knew them. The story line developed so naturally and everyone played their part. Although Bella was my least favorite character, I understood where she was coming from. She was weak, self-conscious, misunderstood. She was human. The only thing, in my eyes, that made her even slightly relatable were her insecurities. I like that she found confidence and strength in her relationship with Edward and her friendship with Jacob.     In waiting for Breaking Dawn, I read The Host (Also written by Stephenie Meyer) and was pleasantly surprised. I wound up LOVING the book. I figured then that Stephenie truly was talented and wasn't just a one-trick pony. This made the anticipation for Breaking Dawn unbearable. I knew she wouldn't let me down....    ...But boy oh boy was I wrong. The first few chapters of this book followed the same feel of the last three books in the series. I felt like we picked up right where we left off and was pleased to see that the book was developing at the same natural pace as the others. Then things went terribly wrong. I felt like mid way through the book I had stumbled upon  an atrocious version of Bella's Breaking Dawn story. A fan fic written by someone who didn't fully understand the depth and maturity of the characters and their relationships. Like Stephenie Meyer's had left her computer unprotected and some hacker swept in to ruin what took her three long books to create. The characters started acting OUT OF CHARACTER. There were inappropriate moments of \\"chuckling\\" and some seriously creepy images going on. Stephenie what happened!? I'm devastated at the outcome of this book. I almost wish I could UN-read it and come up with my own conclusion. At one point while reading, I closed this book, threw it (with force) across the room and started to cry. I missed and longed for the original personality traits of the main characters. I didn't understand them anymore. It felt like I was starting the story over with strangers. I feel as though this book was written to satiate the hormonal needs of all those rabid fans girls. Maybe they tied Stephenie to the bed and threatened to pull a \\"Misery\\" move on her but it seems they got there way. The storyline spun wildly out of control and into this CHEESY fantasy world. Everyone winds up relatively happy at the end but at the cost of losing who these characters truly are. Some parts of this book were rushed and incomplete while others dragged on and became tedious to read. All in all, I would say to those people who are looking forward to breaking dawn, keep your mind WIDDDDDDDDE open. Expect the unexpected and try not to compare it to the other three books in the series. In fact try to steer clear of any kind of expectations. Be prepared for an unfamiliar atmosphere and maybe you can feel more satisfaction in the ending of this originally great series.
0765348276|1.0|Somewhat enjoyable, very lightweight read. One of Scalzi's first novels, and it shows. Amateurish, poor dialog, and unfunny. I recommend you read The Forever War and Starship Troopers and then there is no need to read this. Maybe he improves in his later novels but I won't bother to find out.
031606792X|1.0|First of all, let me say that I started to hate the Twilight Saga ever since Bella's stupidity in New Moon. Breaking Dawn confirmed my hatred for this series.     **SPOILERS**    So graphic medical scenes are perfectly fine but when it comes to sex, she couldn't even go into the slightest bit of detail? I mean, fans of Twilight have been looking forward to Edward and Bella making the ultimate physical/emotional connection and all we get is fade to black after a few touches...??    As everyone has already said, \\"Nessie\\" should never have existed according to the rules MEYER set and has been telling us for the past three books.     How could any sane person allow Jacob to imprint on Bella's daughter? How did Meyer have the stomach to digest the fact that HER favorite character (I know she's said before choosing a favorite character is like choosing a favorite child, but in an Eclipse Q and A at a local bookstore, she said \\"Jacob is pretty much my favorite character) will be, soon enough, in love and making love to the seven year old daughter of his former love?     No big epic battle? To tell you the truth, I was actually looking forward to this battle, even though I knew it would be cheesy. But no. No battle. Even though we are led to believe, especially after Eclipse, that there will be an enormous battle between good and evil, vampires and werewolfs against the Volturi, we don't get that.     How could Edward even ask Jacob to reproduce with Bella? What MAN would want their wife having sex with another man just so she can have children?     Bella is supposed to be a relateable character (I sure has heck never though so, but Meyer claimed that). Since when has everything fallen into your lap so easily without any type of consequences? Things like that just don't happen in reality. In order to achieve happiness in the long run, we must sacrafice somethings. But no. Bella didn't have to give up anything.     So, all I have to say is that I'm sorry to the die hards whohave been waiting for an amazing ending but never got it.
157912688X|4.0|Christie fans who haven't yet read this one shouldn't be disappointed.  For the most part it's a satisfying yarn with Poirot (unaccompanied by Captain Hastings) using the little grey cells at full bore.  The novel has a somewhat unusual structure, starting at the trial of the woman who is to be Poirot's client, proceeding through a long flashback sequence (in which Poirot does not appear), before moving forward to the resolution of the case.  My one complaint is that the solution to the mystery is a little strained.  Although the murderer was my number one suspect, I was stumped about the motive.  When revealed, the motive seems a bit far fetched in that it would require an extraordinary degree of planning (and luck) for the murderer's scheme to have worked.<br /><br />So, while this is not the Murder of Roger Ackroyd or Death on the Nile, I think most Christie fans will find it well worth reading.<br /><br />By the way, at less than $10, these Black Dog editions are fabulous bargains.
B000000992|2.0|I absolutely love Tool but I somewhat regret buying this LP. The light weight of the vinyl leaves me unsatisfied. Also, the labels look like they were applied by a three year old. The labels were sloppily pressed into the record, cut/torn and don't even feature any artwork (a little boring to look at).
031606792X|5.0|Breaking Dawn is an emotional roller coaster that left me smiling! Everything played out perfectly. For all the people who left negative feedback, are you really that surprised at the outcome of this book? Belle was never some money focused business career woman in the making; she was intelligent, nurturing, and totally devoted to Edward. All of her reactions were true to her! What you guys have to understand is Stephenie is a MOTHER OF 3 who LOVES her children, family and lifestyle; so of course some of that is going to bleed into this story. Please Stephenie -- if you're reading this -- keep it going!! I have to know what happens next!!
B00008EY65|5.0|My wife and I saw when this first came out on DVD years ago,<br />but we thought it would not be something we would want to watch.<br />yet when we saw the previews for HellBoy Two on TV it made us<br />rethink it and I decided to buy HellBoy one. It was wonderful.<br />We both thought it was great and it had us sitting at the edge<br />of our seats.  We are both now impatiently waiting for the<br />release of HellBoy Two to DVD,  being my health prevents me from<br />going to movie theaters.  Hurry up and release HellBoy Two.<br />We can't wait and I am sure you will love HellBoy One just as<br />much if not more than we did (if at all possible hehe).
031606792X|5.0|Ok so i dont know why anyone hates the book. i thought the story was great and thought she laid the ground work for this book throughout the other three. i think its just people who were disappointed cause she didnt cater to their fantasy endings.
031606792X|5.0|Granted, it had to stretch, but there is genius in all of this. SM has made it so that she can do serious other character development later on in other books. And I like happy endings. I wanted good things to happen for everyone, including Jacob. There is enough reality in life, thanks. Fantasy is good for all of us. For me it's nice to know there is a beautiful love story out there of never ending love. God knows there's nothing like that in the real world.
031606792X|5.0|In the months leading up to the release of Breaking Dawn - I kept asking myself \\"How will this story end?\\" I really didn't know how Stephenie Meyer could wrap up this story! I knew what I wanted: Bella, Edward and Jacob to be happy! And that's how the story ended! I was completely suprised by some of the twists and turns this story took. So - I'm not disappointed. I think Stephenie Meyer is AMAZING!!! And I will continue to read whatever she puts out there!
031606792X|3.0|Let me just say, I enjoyed reading the book. As a stand alone read, it took me a day to tear through the massive thing. However, after reading the past books and more recently The Host, I was rather disappointed. I was happy to see all of the characters ended on a good note. I'll admit it, I'm a sap that way. But where was the action?! The sacrifice and heartache?! The excrutiating time where Bella was not herself?! I felt that these elements were missing after the dramatic lead up to them. As a final book in this installment, it was less than what I had wanted and expected.
B000YAA68C|5.0|Hillary Swank should receive an oscar for her performance in P.S. I Love You.  And Gerard Butler is so hot with his thick Irish brogue and roughish good looks.   I can't tell anyone what its about you just have to see it for yourself.
031606792X|3.0|(Warning: spoilers below!)      I went to Borders and braved hordes of giddy teenage girls and a few moms just to get the book early and read it by morning. As an avid fan of the series, I loved the first three books on a typical OCD- teenage girl level. Breaking Dawn however, was a stretch for me to accept and i must admit, i am disappointed. It was written on a completely different level than the previous 3, boasting both mature themes (in comparison to Twilight/New Moon/Eclipse) and many far-fetched plot points.     Let the ranting begin.    First off, Stephenie Meyer will NEVER be the next J.K. Rowling. The media needs to stop fueling that idea. Stephenie Meyer is Stephenie Meyer. Rowling's vivid imagination, moral undertones, and convoluted storylines surpass Meyer's own creations on so many levels that comparisons between the two are completely ludicrous. The Harry Potter series will always touch readers on such a profound level that the Twilight saga could never compare to.    Now onto Breaking Dawn. The wedding and the honeymoon were well done. Meyer tackles the issues that most fans thought bella and edward would encounter (e.g. physical injuries due to sex, edward sacrificing pleasure for bella's safety, etc.) but the pregnancy thing came out of NO WHERE! My first thought was...what the the hell. Though the reason why the pregnancy was possible is briefly explained, the story started to seem like a good fanfiction gone wrong. Though many hate Bella's reaction to the pregnancy, I get where she's coming from with the whole maternal instinct. In general, I thought Book 2 was well-done and meyer did manage to get into Jacob's head and capture his essence nicely. I thought the humor was appropriate, very Jacob-esque.    So then there was the bloodbath birth scene. Amen for a little gore since readers were deprived of such during the VERY anticlimatic \\"climax\\" at the end (scroll down for my thoughts on that). I tried to imagine them turning the birth scene intoa movie and almost laughed at the imagery that ensued. Poor Kristin Stewart.    And then Jacob imprints on Renesmee (btw, the WORST name ever! what is wrong with something normal!?!! The name reminds me of hollywood celebs who cruelly subject their children to obscene names like Apple and Suri. Bella seriously should have just called her Elizabeth, after Edward's mother. I didnt find the age difference between the two so appalling, though many did. However, jacob imprinting on Renesmee was...odd and a bit comical. Like Meyer was DESPERATE for Jacob to have his happy ending. And Renesmee's rapid physical and mental growth was odd as well though they were explained (weakly).     So obviously, Bella becomes a vampire. Thank god. SOMETHING that i desperately wanted to happen that actually played out the way i wanted it to. I was even ok with bella's unnormal new born behavior.     And then, meyer does the thing where she tries to desperately shove some element of danger into the storyline. It happened in Twilight with James. It happened in New Moon with the Volturi. It manifested in Eclipse with Victoria. And it....failed to appear in Breaking Dawn. Unlike Rowling, Meyer seems to shy away from any battle scenes (like in eclipse, bella was in a tent during the fight...good god woman!). It might not be the fact that meyer is uncapable of authoring such scenes but its still a cop out all the same. I felt almost betrayed since she built up that suspense so nicely with all the vampires gathering together and such. Oh, and on a side note, the bit with Jenks was COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY! What a waste of my beauty sleep...    So finally, the Volturi arrived and i was waiting for some type of all out vampire war. But of course, everything was resolved diplomatically. How dreadfully boring and anticlimatic! It was almost as bad as expecting  a porche 911 turbo for your sweet 16 and ending up with a crappy 1995 corolla. And in the end, all the vampires rejoice and EVERYONE lives happily ever after.    That is perhaps my biggest problem with the book. I expected some heartbreak, especially because of Jacob having to accept Bella as a vampire. Also, Charlie embarking on the whole \\"ignorance is bliss\\" route rather than taking on the truth. And what about Renee? Meyer never tells us if Renee actually knows the truth about her daughter. Ugh. another cop out on Meyer's part.     Breaking Dawn is a good, fast read nonetheless on a superficial level. Its like whatd youd expect from a decent fanfiction. However, the book is so far from reality that many readers will be turned off by the many weak plot points and just odd bits.  There are tons of Edward and Bella moments though, which i truly appreciated (Team Edward all the way!) and Renesmee was cute. The story grew on me as i reread some of the parts that i particularly enjoyed and i remember setting the book down at 4 AM  in a somewhat content mood. Or maybe the lack of sleep was just getting to me.    Anyways, can't wait for December 12th when the Twilight movie comes out! :)
031606792X|3.0|***Please be aware that further down there is a small spoiler from the novel***  I am a big fan of the Twilight series.  The frist three books drew me in, and I literally could not put them down.  I am seeing that many fans are very unhappy about Breaking Dawn, and while it was nowhere near my favorite, I did not hate it so much that I felt the need to start a website to vent.   My biggest complaint about Breaking Dawn were the characters, particularly Bella and Edward.  They seemed like shadows of what we were presented with in Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse.  I found myself missing them and their love story that drew us in.  I felt that many of their actions and reactions were not representative of the characters Ms. Meyer originally created.  As I read through the first three books, I was invested in who they were, flaws and all.  This time around, not so much.    After reading other reviews, I found that many people did not like some of plot twists that were thrown at us.  I didn't mind these so much.  Did they fit into the overall Twilight saga?  No.  Were they the twists I wanted to see?  No.  I felt this plot had a much more science fiction feel and some of the events bordered on ridiculous ***SPOILER***  Did we really need Bella vomiting the fountain of blood and the whole gory birth scene?  Probably not.  I also felt that there was a huge build to a climax that was a complete and total let down.  However, the book was entertaining to read, and while I wasn't invested this time around, it held my interest.     Overall, I would say that as its own book, Breaking Dawn was entertaining and a decent read.  As the final part of the Twilight saga it was somewhat of a disappointment.
0452289963|5.0|Christians who oppose this book betray their lack of knowledge of New Testament teaching. First, St. Paul wrote in 2 Corinthians 6:2:  ... behold, NOW is the acceptable time,\\" behold, NOW is the day of salvation...\\"  And in Romans 12: 2, St. Paul writes, \\"... do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed BY THE RENEWING OF YOUR MIND.\\" The work of the Holy Spirit is to constantly transform us by renewing -- making new our mind, leading us into deeper understanding of the truth -- because no human has perfect knowledge.       Living in the present moment, with the past forgiven and left behind, is taught all through the New Testament. This book is excellent for teaching us a simple way to silence the \\"mind of the flesh\\" and continually activate the \\"mind of the spirit.\\" (Romans 8)    This book is a blessing for those who are serious about spiritual growth.

B00005JNJV|5.0|What a stunning achievement. This is what a superhero movie should be like. A great origin as well as villians. No over the top performances; everyone did a great job. A lot of people didn't enjoy Katie Holmes in the role she was in, but she really didn't bother me much. The Batmobile was awesome. And the ending was fantastic with a clue as to what villian will be in the next movie - The Dark Knight.
031606792X|1.0|I'm a newer reader the the Twilight series. I just read them a few weeks ago and thought they were somewhat entertaining. No way are they masterpieces, and they have quite a bit of flaws, but for what they are, they were entertaining and I was happy that I didn't have to wait long for Breaking Dawn.     Meyer's writing and story telling needs a lot of work, although there was improvement which each book.....Then I get Breaking Dawn and was shocked at how bad it was, came here to see what other felt and find I'm not the only one who feels this way. I think that's telling....     I think it's VERY telling that people who are huge fans of the series, people who are devoted to Meyer's work and character can admit that Breaking Dawn was disappointing to them, instead of kissing her tail. At least they can admit that Breaking Dawn was poorly written and the story was ridiculous.     The Twilight series is pure \\"popcorn\\" entertainment. There's nothing magical about it, nothing Aw inspiring, and nothing groundbreaking about her work, yet it is entertainment at most. Breaking Dawn on the other hand is a horrible book, plain and simple. If people find enjoyment from it then good for them, I'm not gonna stop you, but just a warning to new readers to the series, don't even bother picking this one up unless it for free.     By the way, I returned my book to Boarders. There is no need for me to have a book I'll never enjoy / reread sitting on my shelf collecting dust. I need the room for well written books.
031606792X|5.0|I must say that I'm shocked at all of the negative reviews this book has received thus far. But then again considering that Meyer's main audience is teenage girls, perhaps not. The book is filled with powerful symbolism and universal themes. I loved the continuing thread emphasizing agency and free will. I also loved that Bella finally grows up. I suppose the lack of teenage jargon will upset many, but as Bella's character grows so do the life complexities that she faces. I'm not sure what all the negative reviewers were expecting, but if Edward and Bella were to be together for eternity they needed to be on equal footing. No more teenage gushing and mindless declarations of love (don't get me wrong, those are fun too). But true love is so much more than that. So much deeper. If Meyer's had kept the characters stagnant and maintained their teenage fluff that's all the book would have been, fluff. I think the author intended more than that for her beloved characters. And I'm so very glad she did. Bravo Stephanie. This was your best work yet.

031606792X|4.0|I had so many theories and expectations for this book that by the night before, I was seriously stressing I'd over analysed it. It was unlike anything I thought it would be and being like that, I am more than happy with the final installment of the series that I can quite proudly say I adore. While I have read many unfavorable reviews that not only question the content, the writing style, the author's morals and the sanity of SM herself, I stand in perfect contrast. There is nothing wrong with a mildly irritating lead female getting everything she wants. Above all, this series has been a fantasy fairy tale, where even though things may not have been easy, final resolutions have been met with a degree of complacency. It seemed perfect that the series should have a happy ending... after everything our beloved Bella, Edward and Jacob have been through, I for one am thrilled to see them all happy for the rest of eternity. TEAM EDWARD FOREVER. Peace out Twilighters, it's been a hell of a ride.
031606792X|5.0|I feel the need to write a review of this book because of all the bad press that it's getting.  This book is AMAZING! Stephenie does such a fantastic job with her story telling and to tell you the truth I am still very sad that it's over.  I am SOOO HAPPY about the way this book turned out! It's a MUST READ FOR SURE!!!
031606792X|5.0|Finally the book that lets the characters grow and change.    I found the first book interesting, and the second and third books annoying.  I didn't enjoy that the plot depended Bella continuing to not learn from her mistakes, and the other characters besides Bella and Edward did not advance the story.  As a series continues, the minor characters must step up and carry arcs of the story.  The rating of the books was young adult but I found reasoning of the characters to defend their actions idiotic but predictable, even worse than the typical romance novel.    I did not have high hopes for the finale.  I was more than pleasantly surprised.  I was impressed by the quality of the plotting, the use of different points of view, and the twists.       I don't understand the bad reviews.    Marriage is a big commitment at any age, and to see Bella mature and think of someone other than herself was refreshing.  And realistic.  In the previous books Bella whinged that eighteen was too young to marry, yet it was not too young to decide on the irreversible commitment to become a vampire.  She was inexperienced and short-sighted and none of the \\"mature\\" characters, such as Edward and Carlyle and Esme, made her face up to her immaturity.    I loved it.  And all the whiners who wanted the \\"dark\\" ending where things don't work out, because that is more \\"real\\" are projecting their own pessimistic view of life.  Or their personal fantasy of how they wanted the characters to act.   Write a trite fan-fic if you must, but don't expect a real novelist to make your mistakes.     Just as the Harry Potter books became more mature and complex as the series continued, this closing to the saga stepped up the quality.
031606792X|1.0|This book was awful. I could write something better just by flinging poop at a wall and trying to make out words in the smears.
075640407X|5.0|Pat Rothfuss is the real deal.  I found this book to be wonderful.  Some of the rather rare negative reviews say that this novel is derivative of Harry Potter and the like.  First of all, it is MUCH better written than the Harry Potter books.  (Yes, I am a Potter fan anyway, having read all of the books.)  Secondly, to call TNotW derivative of Harry Potter ignored that Harry Potter is intentionally derivative itself!  It is mythic!  Myths have established narrative patterns!  In fact, Rothfuss twists those patterns JUST often enough to keep things interesting.  Not only that, but he has a wonderful talent for turning a phrase.  (BTW, being a literature professor, I hope I know a little bit about good writing.  Perhaps I cannot write it myself, but I know it when I see it.)
0143038419|5.0|(Eat, Pray, Love) is a really wonderful book about the personal spiritual journey of the author., Elizabeth Gilbert.   The story starts simply enough:  she is unhappy and wants more from life.  She embarks on a worldwide journey to Italy, India and Indonesia in hope of finding true happiness and fulfillment.       I am touched by her generous spirit in sharing this deeply personal story about herself and feel her book is an opportunity for all of us to look inward and find our own happiness and spiritual essence.  I was moved by how she persevered on her journey despite what others might have thought of her choices.  I was also inspired that she eventually found what she was looking for.       This is a very special book that I intend to share with others as I believe Elizabeth Gilbert (author) has written a story that can be read and appreciated by Tutti (Indonesian for everyone!).   There are brilliant insights in this book that reminded me of other authors that I have read and loved, Ariel and Shya Kane.  I am an avid reader of their books including Being Here, Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment; Working on Yourself Doesn't Work and How to Create a Magical Relationship.  These books also provide insight into how to have a wonderful and fulfilling life.  I love to share these books with people and highly recommend them.  The Kanes have a wonderful, spiritual voice with which they teach the reader in very simple and beautiful terms how one can live one's life simply and fully.  One's spiritual journey can occur in other countries as Elizabeth's did or by living in the present moment, the \\"instantaneous transformation\\" that the Kanes write about.
031606792X|5.0|I've been a big fan of the first three books and have read each of them about eight times.  Based on those readings, I was prepared for all of the plot elements in Breaking Dawn.  They were necessary and compelling if one had read the first three books with an eye to prediction.  What I wasn't prepared for was the violence, the breaking of every character.  Bella broke bodily to pieces.   We got to see Edward's self-loathing suicidal despair head on this time, instead of simply hearing about it.  Jacob's intense pain, leading finally to a resolution that was absolutely presaged, was so hard to read, but for me the best part of the book.    I think for most of the fans, Bella and Edward represented the absolute amazing experience of falling completely in love.  Every look, breath and touch has been detailed.  Twilight was always a world that one could take a few steps back from and laugh at: \\"he's spent two years in her bedroom and they're still virgins?  Get real.\\"  But come a little closer to that willing suspension of disbelief necessary for fiction and I fall under that spell again.  It's very powerful.  I guess that's what the  angry fans though forever meant...forever poised on the edge of consummation, the \\"moment of anticipation that may be better than the kiss.\\"  But forever is about commitment and choice and the consequence of your choices.  Here Meyer suddenly shows a fairly strong light on the consequences of that commitment, with more than enough blood to make up for what she had left out before. I thought it was a very \\"adult\\" book in that it dealt with adult issues and adult pain.  It wasn't necessary to have a major battle and kill off a loved character to achieve some sort of iconic narrative of suffering and maturity.  The Jacob section in the middle beautifully achieved that.   I think Breaking Dawn is a fine end to this part of the Twilight stories.  (I also think it's probably great birth control for love struck teens....)
0385340567|4.0|Once again, Lee Child has put his character, Jack Reacher, in a situation that he just could not leave alone, setting him up for adventure and mayhem from start to finish.  Never one to tolerate any type of unfair treatment of himself or others, Reacher will not be swayed from finding out why he is so vigorously evicted from a town where, had he been left alone, he would have simply passed through on his habitual treck to nowhere. When dead bodies begin to appear, and his life is threatened, Reacher is determined to find out what it is that makes strangers so unwelcome in this tiny outpost of a town in the \\"quiet\\" midwest.  When a military facility is found to be close by, his interest is further piqued, and, determined as he is, Reacher digs in until he uncovers the usual greed and self-serving motivation for a potentially lethal situation.  One of the more unusual Reacher novels, Nothing To Lose, nonetheless had my attention as soon as the local constabulary had Reacher's, and this was one I did NOT figure out, until the very end.  Thanks, Lee, for another great read!  As your favorite fellow John D. MacDonald fan, I am looking forward to another 9 Reacher novels!
031606792X|5.0|Okay, let me start by saying, I know so many people absolutely hated this book. I cannot escape the bad reviews. Also allow me to make it perfectly clear that, through the first Bella chapter, I hated it, too.   However, something is to be said for the 700-some pages that was Breaking Dawn. In my opinion, after finishing the book, Bella was certainly completely so... un-Bella in the first chapters and I hated it. But now that I am finished, I think this must have been intentional. A pregnant woman becomes someone entirely new and Meyer captured this fact. She did not bend to conform to the knowledge that her fans would want to see Bella as she was known and loved. Bella was a pregnant woman, and Meyer did well with portraying her as such. Though I will say, the dialogue in the first part of the book wasn't her best, Edward and Bella seemed to flow too effortlessly together- there wasn't the expectable amount of conflict like we saw in the other books when Edward's resolve was always left unbroken. I will criticize that much.  Now, as for those who say Bella should not have been a mother, that she was merely a baby herself. How many of you openly objected to her marriage to Edward? Her marriage at all? The fact that she, as a married woman, was having sex? Now tell me how you can oppose her pregnancy, but not her marriage, and not her love life.  And as far as this wasted chance to give Bella all that power goes, I say this. The one undeniable trait that has ALWAYS made Bella Bella, was her inability to sit back and watch her loved ones be hurt. Bella has always been the protector, the one who always put her life on the line to save those she loved. Always. Bella's strongest traits weren't things that would come back as super awesome powers that no one would ever be able to break through- blah blah blah. The whole thing about these extra powers was that a human's most prominent traits would turn into their own unique gift, if they were lucky enough to have traits that strong to begin with. Bella's strongest trait was her love, and her passion for those she loved, her will to protect them. End of Story.    Through the book, the style begins to settle back into the traditional Meyer style and we see our characters becoming more of who we knew all along they were. There should be something said for Meyer's ability to portray a dynamic change, a living ebb and flow in her characters. Each developed as real as any person would.   I believe that, influenced by only the first parts of the book, several reviewers and readers are simply not giving this book the chance it deserves.    And about Jacob imprinting on Renesmee, this is how I see it. When Bella gave birth to her daughter, some part of Bella was essentially passed on. Jake, in all his love for Bella, found that part he loved so much left in her daughter. JAKE ISN'T SEXUALLY ATTRACTED TO HER! HE ISN'T EVEN THINKING OF THAT YET! Did any of you so opposed to Jake and Renesmee scream about Quill and Claire? Hm?  No, this book is not my favorite out of the four, and no I am not defending it only because so many choose the opposite. I beg you to actually sit down and, after finishing this book, think about how the style changes and progresses, and about everything you loved and hated, and in an unbiased, critical way, decide: was this book really worthy of being the final book to the Twilight Saga thus far? Will your disappointments in this work, or any others for that matter, really break your love for Twilight? For Bella and Edward and Jacob? If you answer yes to that, in the end, then you do not have the right to call yourself a \\"Twihard,\\" or a true fan for the series at all for that matter.   I will stand by Stephenie Meyer and support her book, her entire Twilight works, with a clean conscience, knowing that I really took my time to assess this book, and look at it for what it essentially was. A good damn finish.  Congratulations Stephenie, and thank you for finally giving us some closure.
031606792X|5.0|In my opinion, it was the best of all 3. I wanted everyone to be happy. I have too much drama in real life. I read to get away from that. I appreciate that everyone is happy in the end.
031606792X|1.0|If I could go back in time, and not even get involved with this series, I would do that. There's a few things I liked about the book, but on the whole, I think it was utterly disappointing ending that is ruining my entire Twilight experience.    The author LIED to the fans about the rules, which bugs me no end. The text implies and the author's interviews verify that SM's vampires should not be able to have children. The whole book collapses when Bella, who never showed maternal instincts, and previously derided teenagers who get knocked up and do nothing contructive with their lives, gets pregnant.    In previous books these vampires were flawed, but trying to better themselves. Now, suggesting abortion, describing the bruises from the rough sex, seperating Bella and Edward from the sister they both love most, having Edward lend a car to evil vampires so they can go kill humans...all of these things are character destroying. And don't even get me started on Jake imprinting on Bella's baby.     90% of the book is just squicky. The wedding should have been tacked onto the back of Eclipse, and the whole thing just ended there.
031606792X|1.0|I have never been a huge fan of the Twilight series, but I liked it enough to be interested in reading Breaking Dawn and finding out what happens.  Here's what -- author Stephenie Meyer sinks to new lows with this fourth installment.  The plot twists are ridiculous, the action is minimal, and the conclusion is contrived and unsatisfying.  Not to mention some parts were incredibly disgusting and creepy!  This book was incredibly disappointing.
B000VWE5OY|5.0|I love the new Dr. Who series and when I heard about Torchwood, I was curious. I do not get BBC America so I wanted to do some research before commiting to buy the whole season.     Numerous people mentioned the inclusion of adult themes but they were tastefully woven into the stories. My son is grown up so that was not an issue for me. What impressed me was the almost everyone who talked about Torchwood seems to love it so I downloaded the first 3 episodes on iTunes. It was so awesome I bought the first season and have already preordered the second one.     I am hooked and Torchwood is and will be part of my video collection. And until I get signed up for BBC America, I will be watching any new episodes on my iTouch because I just do not want to wait until the DVDs come in the mail.
031606792X|1.0|Okay, I know I'm probably going to get comments over me saying that the book has no logic.  Yes I am well aware that the whole series based around the fantasy of vampires and werewolves etcetera. I can't get past the fact that Stephenie Meyer broke the rules of her own world while writting this novel.  Numerous times in interviews she has stated that it is impossible for her vampires to have children, and that once turned into a vampire all of their bodily fluids are replaced by venom.<br /><br />As reading this book I felt like all the elements circulated through the other three novels were thrown out the window, the characters for the most part were boring, Edward lost his charm, Bella went from being obsessed with Edward to obsessed with their child, and Rosalie flipped into a motherly role that just seemed out of place (I know Rosalie's backstory and that she wanted to have children, I understand the way SMeyer was probably trying to go with getting Rosalie involved).  If SMeyer was going to get Rosalie put into this motherly role then where was Esme?  Last time I checked she had a yearn to bear her own children as well. As an author, SMeyer developed a seemingly okay plotline but just didn't expand on it enough.  It felt as though it was rushed in the end.<br /><br />The \\"explanation\\" of how Bella got pregnant was also put to fault later in the novel, when a Amazonian vampire explains how his father is trying to create a superior race by impregnating human females with his children.  How would this even be possible if, when using SMeyer's logic.  She explains that Edward was able to get Bella pregnant was because he was a virgin and that he still had sperm in his system from when he was turned 100+ years ago. With that said, vampire males couldn't create more sperm, so how could this Amazonian vampire keep going around and impregnating human females?<br /><br />After the birth of \\"Nessie\\" the book took a downward spiral and was nothing more than a borefest, everything just seemed to happen without any conflict whatsoever.  Bella easily shifted into vampire life without any problems, she was able to care for her baby, keep her friendship with Jacob, and even was able to \\"slightly\\" let Charlie in on her secret. Even at the end of the story, we are led up to believe that there is going to be a fight between the Volturi and the Cullen coven along with other covens who agreed to support their cause.  What you think is going to be a fight just turns into pages and pages of endless drabble between the Volturi and members of the Cullens' defensive, and in the end lead Volturi member Aro agrees to let them be and he leads the rest of the Volturi on their way, so Bella and Edward could now begin their \\"happily ever after.\\"  Where in the last pages Bella finally allows Edward to see inside her mind, one of the features that drew him towards he at the beginning of Twilight.<br /><br />What disappoints me the most is that this novel had potential, it seems to me that in anything SMeyer writes she has a generally good idea but can never expand on it.  Breaking Dawn seems to me as though it was completely rushed, and that she just finished writing it because she had to. Not to mention I am curious as to what happened to the editors in this book.  Has SMeyer ever heard of a thesaurus?  I have never seen an author overuse the words \\"chagrin\\" and \\"dazzle\\" as much as she does.  I am honestly curious as to how any editor would allow the sentence \\"He was both dazzling and dazzled\\" be put into print.<br /><br />Lastly, I find it really sad that there are so many people giving this a five-star review just because it is a SMeyer novel.  Yes, it is nice to have loyalty but please a poorly written book is still a poorly written book no matter who writes it.
031606792X|5.0|In the months of waiting for this book, there were several loose ends that fans hoped that Stephenie Meyer would tie up. These are:    Will Bella become a vampire?  What happens to Jacob?  The Volturi and how is that conflict resolved?    It seems to me that Ms. Meyer gave everyone EXACTLY what they wanted. Not only are all the loose ends tied up, but there are new issues that also get addressed.    I won't add spoilers, so I can't get more specific. For me, the writing style and the way that characters were developed reminds me of Anne McCaffrey's Pern books. We, as readers, are invited into the lives of these extraordinary characters and allowed to see deeply into their conflicts and how they resolve them.     We are asked to suspend disbelief and travel with the author as she explains her vision through her characters. And we are not disappointed.    This is a magical world, a \\"supernatural\\" world, where amazing things can and do happen. In some ways, however, I think the long wait for Breaking Dawn was a no-win for Ms. Meyer. How do you top yourself after 3 huge successes? You don't, really. Just add to the mythology, which she did. And who knows, seven years from now, we might just get treated to a \\"different\\" kind of Twilight story.
0061537934|5.0|The dog, Enzo, narrates his life with his adopted family.  The family goes through some life changing events.  How they do so is a model for how one should go through their own lives.  The story compares situations and the characters reactions to them with driving techniques.  Being an racing dilitant and enthusiast I loved these allusions and they were both appropriate for the situation and accurate.  I am not a dog lover, but I am rethinking that after reading the book.  The story is a little sentimental but in a very good way. Excellent prose.  I am a better person having spent time with Enzo and his human friend.  I
0767817710|5.0|It\\"s a shame that you cannot purchase an American copy of this American film in America.  I had to send to Austrailia for a copy [ must be viewed on region-free player] that is complete.  Europeans and Austrailians can see the complete movie but not us.       The love scene between Ellen and Cort is vital to connect the action in the first half of the movie with the second.  We see Ellen's flight from the town of  Redemption but not her return, nor do we see what caused the change of attitude between them. One moment we hear of her indifference to what happens to Cort and the next  they are conspiring together to avoid killing one another.        Cutting a sexy scene out of a R-rated film is ridiculous especially one vital to the understanding of the movie.  Since Sharon Stone is both star and producer of this film,I would hope she would try to restore one of her best movies. No work on the film is required, just the release of the foreign edition in America. With many films being released on DVD in several versions there is nothing unusual about that.       As far as the film is concerned. the great disparity  in the reviews is explained by whether the reviewer likes this kind of western or not. I do, and  i liked this film very much. Besides, how many films have a cast like this; Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman [always a great villian], Lance Hendrikseb, Pat Hingle, not to mention Russell Crowe and Leonardo DiCaprio just before their big breaks. Let's hope for a complete DVD.
0812550757|1.0|I've read a lot of Orson Scott Card's books, and have always found myself coming away from them a little frustrated. The ideas always seem to be interesting, but end up getting lost in mediocre storytelling. Card dwells on the same unique ideas so persistently, going back to the same well so often, that by the end of the book what I had originally found unique now just seems hackneyed. And now that I've found out Card is so outspoken politically with such (literally) fascist and discriminatory views, I don't even want his books in my house. I've sold them online and donated the money to a worthy charity.    If you find Card's story ideas at all interesting, I'd suggest the following authors for a more satisfying storytelling experience:    Neil Gaiman. Gaiman has the same unique flavor to his ideas, but he also has the execution to deliver an incredible story as well. His work is more on the fantasy side, like Card's Alvin Maker series. The only problem is that Gaiman writes so few books that I find myself becoming incredibly impatient waiting for his next story to come out.    Stephen Baxter and Isaac Asimov. Asimov's works can sometimes be a little less accessible then Card's, but Baxter's are not; they are just as easy a read. Both men are visionaries scientifically, and tell gripping, page turning stories. Both are sci-fi based, like Card's Ender Series.    Stephen King. Most people groan when I say how much I love King's writing, but universally I come to find out that those people have never read his Dark Tower series, just his horror. The seven books that comprise the Dark Tower story, widely considered King's Magnum Opus, are a truly unique blend of equal parts fantasy, sci-fi, and western. Note these are not in any way like King's horror writings, though once you've read the Dark Tower you'll see characters from it turn up in ancillary roles in many of his other books. The Dark Tower, like the Alvin series, is set is a world that is kind of our world, kindof not. The Dark Tower series is hands-down the best series I've ever read. Period.    I hope this helps some readers find some great stories they may have otherwise not found. Happy reading!
0375842381|2.0|As a Protestant Christian, I decided to read these books because I wanted to have an educated opinion of them and all the controversy surrounding them. The result was that I came away with an odd mixture of opinions.         First of all, for all parents out there (especially Christian ones) these are NOT books for young children to read. They contain scenes of graphic violence, they encourage lying and rebellion. They glorify preadolescent, and extramarital sex, even if it is in a very subtle way. For those who care, they are the most anti-Christian, anti-faith story books I have ever read. Philip Pullman is an atheist/agnostic and makes it abundantly clear in his trilogy.        Secondly and from a purely literary point of view, Pullman is a very gifted writer. He knows how to weave a fascinating story. He makes one care about his characters and the fate of his worlds. The correlation to \\"Paradise Lost\\" is brilliant. Sadly, he has thrown away his potential to write about truly great things by choosing to ruminate on his own hatred of \\"organized religion' i.e. Christianity. It is very pointedly Christianity he writes against and not just any organized religion. He makes no comparisons at  all in the books to Islamic jihads or other religions which have spawned blood baths. I also find it interesting that he makes no allegorical allusions to any kind of non-Christian political party which uses its power to oppress people. The communist party is responsible for millions of deaths and its leaders are comprised almost solely of atheists. Would have been interesting if he had mentioned them.         He uses his books to drive home his own agenda and believe me he DOES have an agenda. As opposed to the relatively harmless Harry Potter books, it is impossible to read these stories and deny any ulterior motives. Pullman himself has stated that his intention in writing these books was to influence children toward atheism. This is a direct quote from \\"The Amber Spyglass\\": \\"The Christian religion is a very powerful and convincing mistake, that's all.\\" How in the world do people argue that these books are not anti-Christian?          A third conclusion I drew from these books is that Pullman has a terrible, terrible understanding of Christianity itself. I mean he really does not get it. (I suppose this is true of all atheists) His experience with the Christian faith is only that of the politics, rules and corruption of the Catholic Church. He has no grasp whatsoever of true faith in the God of the Bible. He knows the Bible but he does not understand it. He views sin as \\"natural pleasures\\" and depicts resistance to it as \\"repression\\". He also seems to suffer from the delusion that Christianity discourages any kind of sexual pleasure. This is a gross misconception. God strongly encourages it as long as it is within the bonds of marriage. (Read \\"The Song of Solomon\\".)        I was both disgusted and amused at Pullman's depiction of \\"God\\" as a feeble and geriatric being. I assume that this character is a fantasized version of what he thinks God is really like. The last book especially is overflowing with the relief he would evidently feel if the world were to discover that God was simply a fraud. Poor man. If his \\"God\\" were truly the one running the world it would be in a much worse state than it actually is. I suspect that, contrary to Pullman's claims that he is an atheist or agnostic (he can't seem to make up his mind which) he is in reality a misotheist (one who hates God). If he were simply indifferent to God and to Christianity, then I don't see the reason for him to basically write a three-book rant against the two, ending with \\"God\\" being killed. There's definitely some kind of negative feeling going on there.        The end result is a confusing and morally ambiguous world view. I don't envy him it. His books are populated by broken families and separated loved ones. His explanation about death is basically lifted from the hindureligion. I could not figure out what his heroin's great \\"choice\\" was supposed to have done for the universe. There is a definite flavor of nihilism and anarchy by the end of the third book. He tries to reconcile it all with a neat little moral admonition, which I suppose is his version of the meaning of life; basically to be good and learn a lot and work for grace, but it falls flat. (Incidentally both of these concepts are directly contradictory to Christianity; we are told that we cannot work for grace, it is freely given and that \\"All our righteousness (being good) is like filthy rags.\\" Isaiah 64 4-9)         The whole time I was reading HDM, a verse from the Bible kept popping into my mind: \\"For the message of the Cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to those who are being saved it is the power of God.\\" I Corinthians 1:18) Poor Philip Pullman is a shining example of the first part of that verse.      In ending, I would actually encourage people (older people) to read these books. They are a fascinating insight into an atheist's faith system, not to mention ripping good stories. (If you can stomach all the polemic.) When you're done with these, I challenge you to go read the Bible cover-to-cover and compare it against Pullman's personal gospel. I know which one I'm sticking with.        I would only rate \\"His Dark Materials\\" with one star except that I have to tack on an extra one simply as a nod to Pullman's writing talent.

031606792X|2.0|Each book in this series has gotten progressively worse.  I have never read such a weak female lead character.
031606792X|1.0|The best example I can come up with to describe how I felt after finishing the last page of Breaking Dawn would probably be this: imagine that you waited months and months for the sequel of a movie (that you had really enjoyed) to come out, bought tickets the day it debuted in your local theater, and sat down with a big bag of popcorn in your hands--only to discover minutes after it started playing that the actors in the previous movie had been replaced with two dimensional cardboard cutouts of themselves, complete with a bad setting, bad acting and a plot that was so cliché that it seemed like it was written by a writer with no creativity or experience.     I know, I know, I DO sound harsh, and I feel bad pounding Stephenie Meyer like this. It's just a book, and I realize that. But still, I have an unquenchable urge to vent my feelings about the huge disappointment that could have been a really good ending for a really good series.    It just seemed so... off! Like I had stumbled across a book that had the same names of the characters in Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse, but couldn't possibly be part of the same chronicles! For some reason, SM suddenly went all acid trip on us, adding a random devil baby in the mix (with a hideous name, I might add) for no reason at all! Edward has no real personality anymore, he just tacks the word \\"love\\" onto his sentences when referring to Bella, chuckles as much as a jolly elf, and likes sex. Actually, speaking of having no personality, neither does Alice, Esme, Jasper, or Rosalie! :D Their characteristics pretty much start and end at Alice liking clothes, Esme always being worried, Jasper pouting, and Rosalie being pretty much obsessed with babies. THE END. No, seriously, it's that bad.     To end this rant, I would like to leave you with a few words that I picture SM would say if asked to describe the main moral and lesson taught in Breaking Dawn: Life always has perfect endings, no one is ever sad, and a woman can only be happy if she has a husband and a child.     Unfortunately (and ironically), all the cookie cutter conclusions that make up this piece of fiction have ultimately made for the Twilight Saga to have a very unhappy demise.    (WRITTEN ON MY MOM'S ACCOUNT)
031606792X|1.0|I love the Twilight series, I couldn't stop reading Twilight, New Moon and Eclipse once I started. I was at a Borders at midnight to have this book. I was so excited about it. But this book was so different from the others. It could have been a good different, but no, not for me at least. I saw myself stopping and stopping. Several parts of this book made me so mad, confused and I just needed to close the book and take a deep breath, let a few hours pass by to keep on reading.    Be careful, several spoilers ahead!!!    First of all, the characters. They were all out of character, except for Jacob. Bella is not the same one that we saw on the other books. Edward is so different too, and almost non existent, just like the other Cullens. Alice has no resemblance to the girl that I loved on the other 3 books. Rosalie is creepy on book 1 (I was expecting her to run away with the kid as soon as it was born.) Emmet, Jasper and Esme barely appear for the first half of the book (or more than that).    Over all this whole book seemed to rushed to me. You have Edward and Bella having a kid, after Stephenie Meyer telling us for years that this was impossible. It is not a good thing to lie to your fans. I was not against the thought of them having a kid, but I didn't like the way she wrote this kid. It all seemed to rushed to me. Bella is only pregnant for one month, the kid grows up much faster than normal humans, is too smart, too beautiful, too understanding. I just couldn't connect with the child (BTW, what a horrible name, Renesmee. It is not one of the reasons why I didn't like the kid.) I just couldn't see this child as a child, by the way SM described her the whole time. Also, I couldn't see Edward and Bella as parents. There was very little interaction between Edward and his daughter. I couldn't feel a daughter/father bond there. There were several Jacob moments with the kid, but the ones with Edward, who is her father are almost non existent. I just don't agree to that. A small child is closely bonded to her parents, and it wouldn't hurt to read some moments like that, to feel the family bond between Edward and Renesmee. Also, who takes care of the child is mostly Rosalie and Jacob. It seems that Bella only wants to hold her daughter to control her temper, but she doesn't take care of her as a real parent would.    Another thing that I don't agree with is that Jacob imprinted on Renesmee. It was too creepy. He was too possessive of her. The part of the book when he lets Bella hold her own daughter just made me so mad. She is her daughter and he has no rights to act the ways that he did. Imprint or no imprint. Also with the kid appearing to be a toddler she called him \\"My Jacob\\" like a teenager, or even a wife or husband refers to the loved one. Too creepy to hear this words coming from a kid that looks like 2 years old.    One more thing. Bella knew that when she would make the transformation she would have to sacrifice several aspects of her life. But she didn't have to do any sacrifices. She had an outstanding will force and didn't hunt humans, she could keep in contact with Charlie, etc. It just seems like a fairy tale where everything is all right and well. Even her cottage is written like coming out of a fairy tale book. It was too happy, everything went too well. You need drama to captivate the readers (well, at least myself, I am way over the age of reading fairy tales.) and this book had very little close to none. Even the last chapter, entitled \\"The Happily Ever After\\". I just want to gag at this title.    Another thing, Stephenie Meyer seems to think that the happy ending is to be 18 years old, married and with a child. Living in a fairy tale cottage for the rest of your existence. Forget about your dreams, your education, your beliefs (Bella was always extremely strong against being married and having kids, but as soon as she finds herself married and pregnant she is all happy about it??? It doesn't seems consistent to me.) This just seems to tell me that girls should forget education, her beliefs, and be mothers. Sorry, but I just can not agree to that.    I am so upset that this book was such a disappointment. I had so many expectations.    If you didn't buy this book yet, my only advice is, please don't. End it with Eclipse, and let your imagination take care of the rest. Or read some of the fanfictions. Some are very good. This book seems to be the worst fanfiction that I have ever read, but unfortunately it is the real deal.
031606792X|1.0|I am an English teacher, and I am sad this product exists. I have to praise children for reading so they'll continue to read (and their psyches won't be damaged), but I'm having a hard time putting on a smile when I see them with this garbage literature.    Honestly? Stephenie Meyer/Bella Swan (because they really are the same person) claims that her books are based off of Renaissance and Victorian literature? Puh-lease. Poor Shakespeare and Austen and Bronte, and even Robert Frost for the allusion she builds at the beginning of one of her books, are all rolling in their graves right now. Where's the plot? Where's the dialogue without ridiculous tags? THIS IS NO HARRY POTTER REPEAT. *Dies*    Breaking Dawn. *Barfs* A super-human/vampire growing child, and it just so happens that now, all of a sudden, the beautiful Swan can resist blood just as well (probably better in Meyer's mind) than Carlisle who spent hundreds of years growing used to being around humans in a hospital. MARY SUE ALL OVER THE PLACE! And Jacob. Don't get me started. Blood from a sippy cup.    This is garbage. Not ashamed to admit it when not in front of my students. I do hope Stephenie Meyer takes the time to read some of this criticism because, honestly, Breaking Dawn (might) have been better if she learned to listen to people (e.g., editors, publishers, etc.)    \\"Perfect little piece of our forever...\\" *Facepalm*    A chapter title in the book: There Are No Words For This.    AMEN!
B000YABIQ6|4.0|Great show deserving of all of the attention.  Some of the extra's are interesting, but some are kind of boring.  This is a great show and well worth watching.
0743289692|5.0|AWESOME - great book.  Gives a lot of perspective on matters not openly addressed through media.
B0018RWD1S|4.0|This is a good CD. Her voice sounds good. It has a modern sound. But I would have like more variety of styles of songs.
B00006BTCA|4.0|derivative...duh. terrific.. yes. the style of music is absorbed enough to where the players make it their own. pays respect to earlier artists like joy division, echo, cure, wire, etc. fans of this may also like acts such as the german shepherds, minimal man, rick kaley and the menacing mutants, friction, cat party, lost sounds, and new collapse.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Pixar is making some of the best films, ever.  They have lovingly (perhaps, fanatically) advanced the art of animation like I've never seen before.  And I just love them for it.  I love all the Pixar films, own them and watch them over and over.  Each one appeals to me for different reasons, but they all give me such joy to watch.  Last year's Ratatouille stole my heart because I'm an avid cook.  Remy's my guy (excuse me, my rat!).  But Wall-e.... oh my god, Wall-e.  This little robot melts me into a pool of butter.  When I saw Wall-e in the movie theater, I was mesmerized by it.  You cannot watch this film just once because there are too many beautiful and subtle movements, gestures and sounds that you miss on the first watch.  I've been watching online videos and picking up all sorts of things I missed in theater.  I can't wait until the DVD is released.  I'll probably download the movie to my iPod, too.  That's how much I love this movie.  By the way, when I saw Wall-e in the theater, the audience was packed and it was mostly adults.  Bravo, Pixar!  Keep doing what you're doing.
031606792X|5.0|I've read many of the bad reviews on this site and i'm a little shocked by how much people didn't like this book.  Just like the other 3 i was sucked into a world where anything can happen and just like the other 3 books, i couldn't bring myself to put this book down.  i can't believe the things that people are upset about.  if you just let go of all your expectations and let the book take you on a ride, you will have no problem with it.  it's wonderful
031606792X|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book just like all of the others.  After getting so attached to the characters from the previous books, I was so glad to see it end the way it did.  Would highly recommend.
0747586640|1.0|This book is OK until you get about halfway through, then it is simply miserable.....I got so bored with her rambling while in India I couldn't even finish the book. I'm glad I borrowed this book and didn't actually pay to have this women bore me into a stuper. Great title - and that's as far as it goes.
031606792X|2.0|I was always a loyal fan to the first three books of the series, but sadly this fourth installment did not meet my high expectations. While reading Breaking Dawn, I couldn't help but feel as if Stephenie Meyer was on drugs, there's no better way to put it. Everything you thought would never happen...happened. It felt as if she was just writing this to make the fans \\"happy.\\" Unfortunately, for this fan at least, she completely missed the mark.     If you must read this book, borrow a copy from a friend.
031606792X|5.0|I can't imagine why people are upset. This was a perfect conclusion to the series. The best part is that there are other series/books that can be based on new characters introduced in Breaking Dawn. I think it is a satisfying end for Twilight fans.
031606792X|1.0|I am a huge Twilight saga fan -- I read Twilight in hardcover, and I've been waiting for Breaking Dawn for years.  Thus I readily admit that my expectations were high, and maybe no book could have met them, but the book that I bought at midnight Friday night is worse than I ever could have imagined.    I was more excited about this book than I was about Harry Potter 7.  And I've been annoyed by all the comparisons to JK Rowling that poor Stephenie Meyer has had to endure.  But now, I'll compare them, and I'll say that Rowling is the more \\"sophisticated\\" writer.  The HP series and HP 7 were filled with trauma, loss, sacrifice, and most importantly, growth.  The series followed the traditional hero's quest, and for the most part, readers felt fulfilled and gratified with Harry's coming-of-age.  Harry did have to come into his own, understand who he was and what he stood for, and fight for what he believed in.  Did Bella do any of these things?    I agree with those who have criticized the idea that Bella is really not her own person but rather defines herself based upon her relationships with boys -- when I recommend the series to anyone, I always start with the caveat that they have to leave any of their even remotely feminist ideas behind when reading these books.  Not only that, but Bella is not a hero.  She does not come of age.  She does not withstand sacrifice or understand loss.  She does not have to grow up.  She is as immature at the end of the series as she is at the beginning, despite the fact that she's now married, a mother, a vampire, etc.    What should have happened?  There should have been a fight, a final battle.  They should have had to stand for what they believed in, not just Nessie (ugh, that name) but compassion, peace, and love.  Carlisle--and others--should have died.  They should have had to mourn the loss of family.  Edward should have had to step forward as the new head of the coven and new champion of the Cullen way of life.  Bella shouldhave also had to mourn the loss of her human life, family, and friends.  (Was her best friend Angela mentioned more than once in the whole book, by the way?  Oh yeah, that's right, girls ditch their friends once they have a boyfriend, er, I mean husband.  Oh, and moms don't count, either.  I love that Bella's life now revolves entirely around being a mother, but she doesn't give her own mother a second thought.  Oh yeah, when you have a boyfriend/husband, you ditch your own mom, too.  And when you become a mom, you don't need yours anymore.)    Everything in the book was simply too easy for Bella.  Heck, she didn't even have to be a newborn vampire -- she was destined to be a vampire, born to be a vampire, and hence she was perfect at it from the first moment.  Everything was indeed tied up with a neat little bow as so many other reviewers have mentioned.  This conflict over 5 stars and 1 star has nothing to do with whether you were on Team Edward or Team Jacob.  It has nothing to do with whether you thought Bella should become a vampire or not.  It's not a matter of not being able to please everyone.  We are not disappointed because she didn't choose Jacob.  We're disappointed because the book is weak, a pale imitation, a joke.  There is no real conflict, no climax, nothing.  It's simply a nice exposition on how everything worked out just perfectly for Bella and they all lived happily ever after forever even though things got a little stressful at times.  Heck, she didn't even have to worry about breaking Jacob's heart anymore because he imprinted on her baby (yikes...).    Did Stephenie Meyer and her editors write the book that they thought the fans wanted?  If they did, they were thinking of the wrong fans.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I have been teaching advertising and design for over 31 years. I was just getting out of high school and attending a state university, ending up being an advertising design major when all of this stuff was going on in the ad world. So, my rememberence of the time was very vivid and remember the clash of the old and new ad styles at the time and faintly remembering hearing about the book \\"The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit\\", but not reading it. I did take a couple of trips to New York at that time to do some work for the company that I was employed, and just going to New York to try and get a job in an agency. \\"If you make it here, you can make it anywhere\\" was the theme at the time, so everyone wanted to go to New York to get a job, primarily for the experience and the couple of lines on your resume that said so. This, finally, leads up to my review of \\"Mad Men\\", which I feel comes extremely close to accurately portraying what went on at that time.Visually, it is dead-on as far as details are concerned. I remember that time period looking just like that and feeling like that. I feel that as far as portraying advertising at that time and the beginning of the Doyle Dane Bernbach period is tucked in just the right way. My only slight criticism, and this is a bias since I have been part of the industry and teaching how to become part of it, I wish there were more scenes as far as how the agency functioned and maybe a couple more follow-throughs on specific accounts in the agency. But again, that is personal. Also, maybe just a little less \\"soap opera\\" between the characters, which does add to the change in women's position in the business and the real world. Enter the working woman/mother, etc. I feel that everyone should see this show. I also wish that season two would come out as soon as possible right after it is finished.
031606792X|2.0|One of the ways an author creates a believable scenario, believable characters, and believable stories, is by letting the characters take control.  Authors like Elmore Leonard are big proponents of this practice - don't try to force characters into situations they wouldn't be caught dead in, and don't try to force emotions onto them.  The second the author does that is the second the story is ruined and becomes completely unbelievable and impossible to relate to.  This mistake is what Meyers did.  It is obvious while reading the story that she forced the characters to do exactly what SHE wanted, and not what they would have done.  Part of the draw of the other books is that you could really imagine these characters there with you; they had concrete personalities and opinions.  I felt like Meyers tried to force a lot of her personal ideals and beliefs onto the characters, rather than thinking about what Bella would do, or what Edward would do.  At times I couldn't even tell the difference between Bella, Edward, or Jacob.  The characters lost almost everything unique about them aside from physical abilities and traits.  Rather than being truly about the story, Meyers wrote what she wanted her readers to believe.  Perhaps in a different story, this would have been fine.  But by forcing the characters to act and behave in ways she wanted, she stunted the possibilities that this series had for further growth in the minds of its fans.
B000XA5K4I|5.0|I can't think of another action movie that I've watched 4 times when it came out.  This film is a parody of the genre, but simultaneously one of the best films in the genre.  That's high praise coming from me; as a science fiction fan I'd put \\"Snow Crash\\" in the same category, and any fans of that book know what a high accolade that is.<br /><br />See this film for its brilliant action sequences, extremely satisfying send-up of the whole shoot-em-up category, and delightful acting by all the major performers.  Clive Owen was already one of my favorites, but his brooding, angry, carrot-obsessed marksmanship in this film puts him over the top.<br /><br />And the writer & director both deserve mad props.  By the time it gets to literally raining badguys at the end, you're whooping, laughing uncontrollably, or both.  Truly brilliant!
B000H2M3TM|5.0|Having PTSD myself from Wars and other things, I thought this was a great movie!  I didn't read the book first however and normally I do but from what I gather the movie in this instance was much better than the book...    I have read One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and in many ways this reminded me of that, only in the setting of a female dominated one vice a male one....    Maybe in the future if time permits I will read the book itself to see if the movie which I have already seen and truly thought was great stacks up...    If not...    It was that book which inspired the movie and it's a great movie...    And mental illness isn't just something that people are born with, some times they receive it through traumatic experiences such as tragedies or war or the like...    In my opinion it is something that really needs to be given far more attention than it is receiving and this movie sheds light on it like few have...

B0000AQS0F|4.0|This was great show.  Took me a few episodes to get into it, but it seriously grew on me.  Silly at times (in a good way), yet professionally done.  Cast chemistry is great.  Don't get too caught up in the \\"sci-fi\\" genre and give it a chance even if you don't like sci-fi.
031606792X|5.0|I have to question whether some truly understand what they are reading.  The qualms that people are having over certain aspects of BD can be explained in the first three books.  Take some time and read (REALLY read), and maybe BD will make more sense to those that hated the book.      I personally loved the series and found it quite enjoyable.  It could be due to the fact that I realize that it is a work of fiction and anything the author wants to happen can.
B000Q9IZ5C|3.0|Let me start off by saying that I rarely give 5 stars an would have given 3.5 if I could.  Not a bad movie, but the chemistry between the cast seemed a little forced, which was not the case in the show.  A few character changes in movie that I liked better in the show, but overal not bad as I do not typically like sci-fi movies.
031606792X|4.0|As soon as I finished the book I had two thoughts: 1.) I loved it and 2.) some people are going to hate it.    I can see by the reviews that I was right.     With the ending to any story there is a good chance people are going to be disappointed. I did enjoy the book. I thought the characters stayed true to themselves; I thought things that had been established in previous books came back into play/ were brought to fruition; I think the series is fantasy and \\"happily ever after\\" is the ultimate fantasy - so the book delivered what it set out to deliver.     All I would suggest to anyone reading reviews before reading the book is to just read it - throw expectations out the window - then decide for yourself. This book was nothing like what I thought it was going to be - nothing like what I thought it could be, but once I got rid of any expectations I had I came to believe it was EXACTLY right and made perfect sense. It was totally unexpected and completely wonderful.
031606792X|5.0|I wish everybody would stop griping about this book.  Our characters all got happy endings and we got everything we could have asked for.  I enjoyed it very much!
0385495323|5.0|As always Simon Singn takes the reader on a fantastic trip through History. Filled with entertaining stories, puzzles and heroic events, the author skillfully covers the history of secret writing. If you liked his coverage of [[ASIN:0385493622 Fermat's Enigma]] then you will definitely enjoy this book.<br /><br />The prose is capturing, deep enough to fascinate technical readers and light enough to just entertain the casual reader. I specialized in Quantum computers while studying Mathematics and I am astonished that the author manages to explain such non-trivial subjects as quantum computers and cryptography to the degree where ordinary readers can actually understand how they work and their impact on ciphers such as RSA/DSA. In short another great read from one of the best and most entertaining technical writers who ever lived.
031606792X|2.0|Yes, I will join the ranks of those who were eagerly awaiting the release of Breaking Dawn, but were disappointed.  I have often thought that a good book can make you both laugh and cry, but Breaking Dawn may prove to be the exception to this rule.  I did laugh and cry, but it was not a good book.<br /><br />I do think this was the funniest book of the saga, and not because of the outlandish plot.  Emmett made some great comments and the chapters written from Jacob's perspective were really funny (those chapter titles!).  \\"Why am I covered in feathers?\\"  Come on, that had to have made you chuckle.<br /><br />For the crying part, being a new-er mom, I was often moved to tears when Bella made her plans to keep her daughter safe. I also cried earlier, when Bella found out she was pregnant, but I think a lot of that was just new-mom sympathy feelings.<br /><br />All in all, I think I'll do what one reader suggested and just pretend it was a trilogy.  While I frequently re-read #1-3, I don't think Breaking Dawn will receive the same treatment.
031606792X|5.0|This was just perfect, I couldn't put it down, I read it for a straight 12 hours. Just as I wanted everything to end. I couldn't be happier.
031606792X|3.0|As I lay in bed reading Twilight for the first time, I was having difficulty focusing on the words due to the fact that my heart was pounding so hard with excitement that the book was bobbing up and down on my chest.     I am sad to say that my heart did not pound like that in Breaking Dawn. I am not saying that I didn't like it, but I wish it would have at least gotten my heart pumping a little faster.     I am thrilled that Bella and Edward have their \\"happily ever after.\\" I am elated that they are parents - nothing could be more beautiful than that. I am happy that both the Swan's and the Cullen's are safe and sound. I am appreciative that Stephanie Meyer stuck to her guns and stayed true to her beliefs of marriage, procreation, and eternal life.     However, I am disappointed in a few things. I was sad Meyer didn't describe more details of the wedding - we waited years for this wedding - we, as readers, wanted to BE there too. I was left confused as to WHY Renesme grew so fast and I HATE the name Nessie! I DESPISED the fact that Jacob imprinted on Renesme. It was totally predictable and very hard to stomach. Yuck! The ending was kind of a \\"hunter's stew\\" of random characters. I \\"blah, blah, blah-ed\\" my way through the last 1/4 of the book.     I really wish the book would've ended with the birth of Renesme - maybe then I would want to read the next one more.     I hope Stephanie Meyer writes another book in the Twilight series (other than Midnight Sun) that is more reminiscent of Twilight.
031606792X|3.0|*SPOILERS*    I have been reading this series since the beginning and have turned many friends onto these books in the process. I feel like I might warn them to tread carefully before reading this one. As a book it was not a bad read, it just wasn't what I was expecting, at all.      I felt like we never got any Bella and Edward time, from the minute she realized she was pregnant it was doom and gloom. Their relationship became a non-existent plot point.     I tried to justify the child as the reason for bringing the Volturi back into the story, I knew they would figure into the end somehow, but if there was not going to be a fight then the Renessme/immortal Child plot line served no purpose. All those minor characters were brought in to die (I assumed) and then nothing.     And I thought Jacob deserved his own ending not tied to Bella. They should have put him with Leah, they had both suffered the same heartache. It seemed like that was where it was going. If they really needed someone to imprint on the baby then why not Seth, he looked up to Edward, it would have allowed them to make the same alliance, and it would have been far less awkward.    The last two pages were probably my favorite part (and a chunk of the beginning), we finally got to see Bella and Edward interact, it made me sad to see it end and sad that it took me 750 pages to feel the romance I felt in the first 3 books.     I'd rather we just got to see them as a couple for a hundred pages, let them go off to Dartmouth and be in love. Find some other catalyst to turn her, besides the blood and guts of \\"childbirth\\".  I felt like I gained nothing from this story that I didn't already know. Bella and Edward would end up together that was not a question. I just would have liked a better send off.
031606792X|5.0|I was disappointed that a lot of people didn't like it. But I'm glad that I found people who liked it. But In the end I really didn't care if no one liked it or not. All that matters was that I did.    To me this book BD was all about growth,change and family.    I mean we got to see Bella's perspective as a vampire and what things smelled like to her. It was like being born all over again. I enjoyed her thoughts on Charlie and Jacob and her first hunt etc..    She(Bella) was even able to maintain a relationship with Charlie, and he was able to create a relationship with his grand daughter. which there was some cute scenes with them. Even though he didn't want to know the situation. I had to give it to him for the don't ask/ don't tell policy.    Although the pregnancy was unexpected and weird and graphic, it was fitting that it would be in the book, because of all the strange things that were happening in the past three books. Ms Meyer showed us the graphic scenes so that it was understood that Edward now had to make the decision to turn Bella because she was dying right in front of him... Even Jacob was there giving her cpr to try to bring her back, but it was not working. It might not of been the way Bella wanted the change to happen; but it still happened.    the first three books to me, was showing the build up of the amazing love, this one just focused a little bit less on it. So while other things may have focused on it made the book all the more special to me.    Like when Edward first saved Bella's life from the runaway van. Like when she first realized that he was a vampire.. these are not normal things..    So I loved it, and Reneseme was so cute in the book. I loved the way she was described.. I was aww'ing through scenes she had with Bella, especially when she touched her face to show her how her day went.. It was a perfect power for Edward and Bella's daughter. Hearing her call for daddy and mommy was so amazing to me.    I totally understood why she named her child that way, she was honoring her mother and mother-in-law, so that was understood.    I loved that Bella finally at the end was able to let down her shield even if it was for a moment to show the man that she loves how she has always felt about him. I even loved his reaction to it all.       Ms Meyer might of mentioned that vampires can't give birth, but Bella is human, and Edward is a male. she never said that a male vampire can't conceive a child with a human girl.      So I recommmened this book, it has all the elements of a good book.
B00005JNJV|5.0|I guess the reason I've always loved Batman, the character, is because he is not really a Superhero. He has absolutely no 'super' powers and really has to get by on skills and training. That is why, when this came out, it was extremely exciting. How did Batman come to be? You will find out if you watch this. It is quite interesting and entirely plausable.     Of course, credit must be given to Christian Bale, who can do just about anything. He molds himself into this role perfectly, It was like he was always suppose to be Batman. His alter ego, Bruce Wayne reminds me of his character in American Psycho. There are glimpses of snobbery that you can't really but compare to the other film. As Batman, he is truly perfect. The voice can get a tad grating at times, but he doesn't really talk all that much for it to be an issue.     The supporting cast is great as well. I love Michael Caine as the ever-trusty Alfred. He brings a great balance to the film, with wit, charm and just the right touch of humour, when the film calls for it. And his empowering speeches are something to behold.    My other favorite character is Gorden, played by the always brilliant Gary Oldman. He is spot on in this role. I always enjoy watching his scenes, especially between him and Batman. He is probably my favorite character in this, save for Batman.    Liam Neeson has a nice juicy role as well, though he is barely in the film. He always has great presence.    The visuals are all spectacular, as are the costumes, and the Batman car is pretty darn cool. All in all, it's a great re-invention of the Batman franchise. Just pretend the others don't exist (well, except for the first 2 maybe).
0375842381|5.0|I have only had time to read the first novel, \\"The Golden Compass\\". This is a great start to a fantasy trilogy. Great fun for young readers and adult readers as well. I can hardly wait to get through the next two books and see where Pullman goes with this epic story. A must read for fantasy enthusiasts!
B0018CWEYY|5.0|I didn't think Season 3 was as bad as some people claim it is. It's Lost and I love it, no matter what. But wow. Season 4 just kicked some major booty. Absolutely everything you could ever ask for in a show is within this Season. Not since the first Season has Lost been THIS good. The only downside is the fact that it is not as long as the other seasons.     There are surprises and twists galore. The characters old and new are interesting and engaging. The actors all do a fantastic job, it's just so obvious that they enjoy working on this show. The story line can get a tad confusing a times, but it really does come together (for the most part). Yes there are more questions, even though some have been answered. But that is why this show really grips people. There are so many emotions packed into the season, each episode is a practical cliffhanger and teaser to the next one. It's almost mind-consuming.     The mysteries and intriguing and you WANT to watch every single episode, because if you miss even one, you're basically screwed and out of the loop. I really can't say enough about this show.  And it really does appeal to alot of different people and age ranges. It's great to watch it on DVD so you're not dealing with the commercials. Less tention and waiting that way. Easily, the best show out there.
031606792X|3.0|I've been so mopey after reading Breaking Dawn and I'm finally able to realize what's been bothering me since I've put the book down. The outcome was too easy, predictable. If you cut out 400 pages from the middle of the book, you wouldn't miss much.     The relationship between Bella and Edward is a shadow of what it was in the first three books. Bella no longer needs Edward to keep her safe because she becomes his equal. This was an element that I always enjoyed in the previous books and expected to still find in this one. They are both so grown up, almost boring... settling into the life of any married and blossoming couple with all their problems already worked out.      Nessie is fun, but the whole pregnancy makes Bella seem so old. She can barely keep from tripping over her own two feet let alone care for a child. Edward's indifference to his child is also disappointing. You think he would have a stronger reaction to Jacob's imprinting.     I wish that the relationship between Edward and Bella could have been stronger when she turned, or perhaps discussed/explained. Again, it was so easy. Like, she had no issues/problems, whatsoever. I expected more conversations between the both of them. I'm only guessing that perhaps when or if Stephanie Meyer decides to write from Edwards point of view, BD will be... less unnerving.       I will still recommend these books to my friends, but I am a little less on fire for the series myself.
031606792X|1.0|Since I had read so many reviews before I started reading BD I  thought I was prepared for, and was pretty much okay with, the direction the story was going. But then I got to the actual  birth and I just found the whole thing hilarious as though I were reading a bad horror parody. After that I couldn't take any of it serious. And poor Jacob, he deserved better.
B00005A0V0|5.0|There are not too many reviews for this one, therefore I had to weigh in since this album is so good.   I took a chance with this album, not knowing what to expect, and I'm very happy with it. I've only listened to it twice, so I'll give my first impressions. The vocalist sounds like Ringo Starr, which is appropriate because the music and lyrics are fanciful and playful. The music takes you back to a happier and more optimistic time, the early 70s. If you work in a creative field, this album will inspire creativity. I highly recommend it if you are a fan of progressive rock or music from this era. I can't believe I went for so many years without hearing this. The radio stations have been really oppressive for not playing music like this. Take a chance, get this album and enlighten yourself.
031606792X|4.0|First off, the book... the whole series was actually an interesting read. I had put off this series because at first glance I wasn't that interested in the storyline. But I'm between books waiting for releases and thought what the heck. So after the first one last week I was hooked. Yes I thought the girl was a lil too much girlie (reminded me of those old breathless romance novels where the females couldn't do anything). But I was intrigued. I mean I love the new paranormal/fantasy line thats become popular, was reading them before they became mainstream. I'm more for the romance aspect, but I wanted to see where she was going with this story. And wow, what an ending. Yea its not the classic what most people would have thought. It was unique, which I thought all along, and thats why we read folks. To dive into another persons world, their fantasy as they think it........    Now I never wrote a review on here, but after reading some of the negative responses I just had to comment. I've read some bad books before and thought what a waste of money, should have got it at the library. Because I would have read it one way or another no matter how bad it was.  I love to read. I'm just so disappointed in how negative people were about a storyline. It's a book folks. We don't blame movies and tv on how people think, books go in the same category. If you started reading it and didn't like how the characters acted, don't read anymore! If you think you could do better, then write it! Don't come on here acting all insulted because she wrote what she felt and believed the characters would be like and behave.  Please get off the morality high horse people, it's a book. And to those people who are confused about how things came together at the end, I think you may need to reread the entire series again.     These are the primary issues people have and my understanding of them:  Bella being weak/caring too much: Yea bothers me some, but thats the character. She took care of her momand had to be the adult so she handles things differently.  Jacob bonding with the kid: Did you not read about Quil and Claire? Read about her explanations again incase you missed it.  Bella having a kid: She's over 18, I mean really... why not start your moral issues with the 13 year olds in the real world instead of harping on this book?  Renesmee: It's a name, I've heard of worse.    Ok rant done. If after you've read all the reviews you want to read the series please do! If you're going to get all uptight about a book, don't.
B000YRY8BG|5.0|This was an excellent TV series! It features some of my favorite British actors. Bill Nighy is excellent with his deadpan humor in his role as editor ~ but so are all the others. The script never drags along so the audience cannot lose interest. It has been produced for American television (condensed to two hours with a different setting and different stars) due out in April 2009. I don't see how one could improve on the original, however. It is well worth the time you will invest in watching. It truly does have an unexpected twist at the end!
031606792X|4.0|Look ...I understand the arguments against this book. It's going to be one of those either you love it or hate it stories. Thankfully, I fall into the former category.<br /><br />Does Meyer tie everything up in a neat little bow? If you were reading the book not necessarily. There was mentioned near the end there is the chance that the Volturi could come back and try to pick everyone off. What was given to the characters was a brief reprieve (or brief in vampire time).<br /><br />Also Jacob imprinting onto Renesmee wasn't creepy. It wasn't creepy with Quil. If you read the other books, there isn't inevitably going to be a romantic relationship, it's pretty much that the person/wolf would like to see the object of his imprintation (is that a word?) happy ...whether that means they are together like that or not.<br /><br />The whole point is to protect and make happy (girls if only we could all find a guy like Jacob).<br /><br />I do disagree with Evantide. The message isn't \\"If you have problems, they will ALL work out.\\"  That's a pretty sarcastic reading of the end of the book. I thought it was to always have hope...no matter what the odds, no matter what is in front of you and that is not a bad thing to convey to readers, in fact it's pretty damn impressive when we have to deal with a world where hope is almost nonexistent.<br /><br />So that's my two cents I loved the book. I loved the series ,and I'm glad it ended the way it did. I do hope that Stephenie continues to write. It gives me hope that one day I'll get published. Keep up the phenomenal work!
B0011UBDTK|5.0|Never got around to watching show while it was running as regular series on TV but watched the new movie....and boy! I was hooked.  There's just something about the story line of this really close group of friends and the love affair of Carrie and Big that drew me in.  (What a hunk he is!)    So glad I've got the chance of going back now and enjoying all those original episodes I missed and at my leisure.
031606792X|2.0|I am an older (!) fan who was so excited for this book. Even dragged my husband to a Breaking Dawn party (we were dressed as Edward's parents-- my DH in white tie and tails!) Read the book in one day, with two meal breaks. I laughed, I cried, I yelled at the characters... So many parts were like coming home for what I knew would be the last time. The wedding was perfect, Jacob's visit to the reception both warmed and broke my heart. I thought Stephenie handled the \\"honeymoon\\" details masterfully. And yet... as soon as it was obvious Bella was pregnant the whole thing just changed for me. I could still enjoy individual parts (the line about Jacob claiming his birthright was brilliant, I loved the description of Bella's vampire senses), but I had this huge feeling the whole thing was unfair, as if the rules had been changed in the middle of the game. It just didn't feel right. She SAID vampires cannot have babies. I don't care what legalistic mumbo-jumbo there was about \\"most\\" fluids, or that she didn't mention men. I felt deceived. Renesmee left me cold. And the showdown with the Volturi was anticlimactic. I agree with whoever said she missed Alice. I *love* Alice. The whole thing with J Jenks was a red herring... I also agree that the character development was somewhat lacking. So, this experience has definitely been bitter sweet for me. Guess I'll start looking into fan fiction to feed my addiction. I read one while ago that, while of course not written nearly as well as SM could do it, had what was to me the perfect ending. Sigh.
031606792X|3.0|There's no doubt that Stephenie Meyer is a fine writer.  The first three books of this series had me hard; I read two of them in a weekend.  (Yes, I did nothing else that weekend.)  I was looking forward to see how she wrapped this up.  I guessed all the spoilers long before I actually read them, but it was still a fun read.  However, I felt the book just ended too abruptly - the big climax with the Volturi was over way, WAY too soon, and then it's just \\"okay-they-live-happily-ever-after-the-end-thanks-for-reading-bye.\\"  Wha...?  I actually looked at the last page for a good minute, then flipped back a few pages and said, \\"What...that's all?\\"  So I can't gush here, unfortunately.  A good read, yes, but it was missing that final \\"umph\\" to wrap up the series.
031606792X|2.0|I admit I am an obsessed Twilight fan.  I loved the first three books and have been nervously anticipating this new book.  I read an interview with SM once that said she would tie this story up with a nice bow.  I was worried, because that isn't how stories should necessarily end, but I really didn't think it would be this bad.   Spoiler alert!  I thought the first two chapeters were a little slow.  I was actually looking forward to experiencing the engagement.  Maybe some of the challenges they faced preparing the wedding and really not having her parents be so quickly excited. Their response wasn't at all in character for them. I looked forward to her going to college and I looked forward to the added sexual tension between them.  Sadly there was none of that. It seemed to rush through the wedding and send them right into the honeymoon.  I actually found that enjoyable to read.    But then...Bella's story from Jacobs POV. I turned the page and saw that and literally gasped.  I couldn't believe she had actually taken Bella's story and turned it over to another character to tell. The whole thing with Rosalie being the one Bella turned to was unbelievable and Alice was almost non existant. It was so disappointing. As I progressed through the book I just kept hoping that she would wake up and find that everything was just a dream and she would be in bed in her moms house in phoenix.  I thought that would be the only way to redeem the book.  The whole baby thing was absurd.  I think the draw to these books is that it is a fantastic story but living enough in reality that you begin to believe it actually could happen.  But the baby pushed it off the reality cliff. Sometimes things should be left to your own imagination, and I think this story should have done that.
031606792X|5.0|I discovered this series two weeks ago, devoured the first three and was anxiously awaiting the 4th.    I  read many reviews and all the horrors that people were discussing because of the spoilers they found, and I still decided to read it.     I wonder how many people that were disappointed by this book are the type of people to be angry when a movie doesn't turn out exactly like the book? I think the reason so many were offended by this book is that they had somehow built up expectations and predictions of what the ending should be like.    Personally, I prefer NOT to be able to predict the end of a book. Why read it then? Plus, how could there possibly be a cookie cutter ending to the story of a human girl in love with a vampire and a werewolf? The whole concept is ridiculous and farfetched, how could the end be any less?    **Spoilers**   I've thought it was beautiful that Edward wouldn't have sex with Bella before they were married, even if it was just to manipulate her into marriage. To the conservatives out there, isn't sex-after-marriage what is trying to be promoted?     To the people that were pissed about Bella trying to convince Edward to postpone her turning so that she could continue to enjoy sex -- well, everyone was under the impression that she would be crazy like all the other newborns for a couple of years anyways and she was worried that she wouldn't love or want him afterwards. I can understand wanting to keep that intimacy alive for a little bit longer, just in case it wouldn't exist anymore.     To the people that were upset about her being able to be pregnant: there really wasn't any living precedent for human/vamp relationships. They didn't know she could be, so how can you claim it's unbelievable? Hello, she's married to vampire! Why the heck not conceive a baby of some sort?    To those concerned about the alleged \\"wife-swap\\": Think of the circumstances. Edward thinks that she can never have a baby by him and live. Bella is willing to dieto allow the baby to live. Slight impasse. He's going out of his mind with grief and terror, and decides that if he offers her a shot at another baby, one that wouldn't destroy her, maybe she will give this one up and chose life. Yes, he could have gone with artificial insemination, but he wasn't thinking clearly anyways. I agree it was a little out there, no excuses, however, that's what SM chose to .     I read someone's review a bit ago and they asked if we wanted young teenage girls thinking about abortion, young pregnancies and being married so early. I do not personally agree with abortions, however, it is an option. Why don't you want your daughters reading about it though? Haven't you talked to them and explained what it means? What the potential health and emotional consequences are? Are you scared of letting a book do it? Do you write letters to the young Hollywood starlets and lambast them for being teenaged and pregnant and married? Another point, being a vampire lasts longer than being married. Does this mean there was a petition out to convince Bella to wait til she was 25+ to become UnDead? Edward wanted her to experience as many human things as she could, including marriage. He bartered that if he was to be the one to bite her, than she had to marry him first. She was marriage shy, and I can understand him being anxious about that because becoming undead was a bigger commitment that marriage.     Those are all the things I can currently think of that bugs me about peoples reviews.. :)
031606792X|1.0|this is the most aweful book ever  i expected so much for this book, and then i got this  i mean what the hell!! it was incredibly idiotic. it just makes no sense, bella wasnt supposed to get pregnant  my only thought about the book was that stephenie didnt know what to write and searched in fanfictions.. cause it was incredibly aweful!  even giving this book a star its aweful!
031606792X|1.0|I'm completely disappointed.  I'm having to force myself to finish the book.  I can't believe that Meyer took the easy way out.  If she wasn't going to actually write a new story in Breaking Dawn, did she really need 754 pages to wrap it all up?  With all the Romeo and Juliet references, I was extremely disappointed that Meyer didn't carry that thought to the end.  Where was the great sacrifice?  Wasn't that the point?  That a love like Edward and Bella's was SO great that surely it had to end in some kind of tragedy or some kind of great sacrifice. That to have a love like that, you have to give up something in return?  Instead we get Bella gets knocked up (which is just ridiculous even for a vampire story) and rides off into the sunset with Edward.  She keeps her new life and her old one.  She is off the hook with Jacob because he imprints on Renesmee (don't even get me started on the name choice).  It just doesn't fit with the whole saga up until this point. It's like someone else wrote it.  Everybody dropped the ball on this one...author, editor, and publishers.
031606792X|1.0|This book sucked.  I am still trying to figure out if Stephenie Meyer really wrote it.  It had such a different tone than the other 3 and wsa just so far fetched and stupid.  I don't think I will ever read it again.  I will just pretend Eclipse is the last book.
031606792X|1.0|Plenty of people have already managed to point out the obvious flaws with this book - the shoddy characterization, the lack of plot, the loss of all that we, the fans, knew and loved in the past three books - so I'm not going to reiterate that for you. It'd be pretty pointless (although, you could say that, since the object of this review was pointless, perhaps I should follow it in tone). What I am going to say is this: I am sorry I ever read this book, and I'm even sorrier I was dumb enough to pay money for it. I really wish I had not exposed myself to the utter absurdity that is Breaking Dawn. This book took all that I liked about the Twilight Trilogy (and it is a trilogy in my mind; I have decided to pretend that this is just one very long fanfiction), tossed it in a blender, and hit PUREE. The result? One ugly mishmash of vaguely related plot ideas and characters.     Reading Breaking Dawn, for me, was an odd experience. Partly because, having managed to convince myself that the leaked chapters online must have been a hoax, I could not believe how poorly written it was. Mostly, though, it was because I just couldn't manage to relate it to the preceding books in the series. I felt like if I tilted my head and squinted at the pages long enough, I could just see a resemblance to the characters as they'd been presented.     Maybe Ms. Meyer got confused; she forgot which series was supposed to have the bodysnatchers, and replaced all the Twilight characters with aliens. That would certainly explain Nessie, at least. Or maybe she just got sick of all the J. K. Rowling comparisons. After all, she's been asked in nearly every interview she's had about how she feels about being called \\"the next J. K. Rowling\\". Well, congratulations, Steph. You can be sure no one's going to make that mistake ever again.     I could have withstood all of that, though, without being as offended as I am were it not for the absolutely awful message she is sending teenage girls everywhere. Get married, get pregnant, give up on your education - it'll all work out. You'll have the happiest, most perfect, and most DAZZLING life ever. And then, of all the things, she has the nerve to say that Bella is a \\"strong female character\\"?     As if.     If it weren't for Leah Clearwater and Rosalie, there wouldn't be ANY characters in the books that fit that description, and even they don't fully deserve it. But at least, mythology aside, they are human - they have flaws, emotions, and ideas independent from their \\"truuuu wuv\\" for any male character.     Jacob really got it right in Eclipse, pre-lobotomy/imprint on the Loch Ness Baby - Bella would have been better off dead. At least that's normal, regardless of your religious views on what comes after. Now she's doomed to spend all eternity as the Stepford Vamp. What joy.
031606792X|5.0|I loved this book - I couldn't put it down all weekend until I finished it. I am so diappointed in the people bashing Stephenie Meyer, especially the ones who are critizing her about Bella's pregnancy.  You sound ridiculous.. Bella was married - and then got pregnant. I guess all of you have forgotten that back in the day many women got married at 18, and became pregnant shortly after.  Just because we live in an era where women don't get married until their 40's, and then decide to have a child at 45 dosen't make it wrong to be married and pregnant at 18.  I do not see how this is supposedly giving the \\"young people\\" a bad message. I am sure if Charlise had \\"taken\\" care of the pregnancy - none of you would have said one word about that. It seems to me you would rather have promoted an abortion - then for Bella to keep her baby because of her age -because keeping a baby when you are 18 and married is wrong in your eyes. What has our society come to?   Then there are complaints about the \\"happily ever after\\" ending.. It is almost as ridiculous as saying SM is promoting teenage pregnancy.. Just because most people got married, had a kid, and then got divorced - dosen't mean a \\"happily ever after\\" story does not exist.  You are all right - how dare SM write an ending like that? I guess you feel SM should have written a more politically correct book based on society today? Edward should have been cheating on Bella - and then walked out on her and their child.. That would have been a much better ending - and it wouldn't promote a happily ever after.  And to make fun of the child's name? Really low people. I wonder how many of you searched for the \\"perfect\\" and unique name for your child... I guess Bella should have called her Taylor or Morgan to make the reader's feel better. I guess it is terrible now-a-days to name a child after your mother and mother in law.. To love them so much you want to respect them, and name the next generation after them.  I loved all of Stephenie Meyer's books, and I feel Breaking Dawn was an excellent way of tying all of her books up. AFter reading the reviews - I feel a lot of you missed the point of this book... you are too busy pointing out what SM was trying to \\"promote\\".. It was about true love - soul mates from two different worlds who over came everything to be with one another...True happiness, between two people.  It is out there people - even though it isn't the \\"norm\\" to most of you, it does exist.
031606792X|1.0|I really wish that Stephenie had ended this saga at \\"Eclipse\\". For the first three books, you are amazed the author's imagination. For \\"breaking dawn\\", (I don't want to be harsh on the author, and I still love her for the first three books), all the magic has gone.  BTW, I gurantee that you will not love Edward as much as you loved him in the first three books.
031606792X|5.0|I guess it's really true when they say that each individual walks off with something different when they read a story. This one is clearly one of them.<br /><br />I will try to keep my review free of any spoilers...<br /><br />Personally, I was hoping that Bella did get everything she ever wanted and then some. So for those who think that was a cop-out I have to disagree. Why would I want to read a \\"fiction book\\" if everything in it worked the same way in real life? Why do I want my favorite main character to suffer anymore than she has. Besides, I really suggest for your speed readers to read the book again at a slower enjoyable pace. Bella does have to make some adjustments in her life. She does make some scarifice. However, because of certain events that occured in the story you don't really realize it because our attention as the reader is pulled to the bigger problems in the story.<br /><br />As for the other developments in the story surrounding Jacob. I think it was an interesting twist. My first reaction definitely surprised and almost apalled. But as Bella begins to think about the matter, I too understood and accepted reasoning/possibility of it.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book very much and will continue being an avid fan regardless of the prior reviews. It was well written, very tastful in parts where it could have been racy keeping the series as wholesome as possible for those younger readers. The series ends with an opening for future books with characters that each have their own story to tell. Personally, I would love to see future books about any of the old and new characters introduced in this book.<br /><br />For being the last book in Bella - Edward series I gave it a 5 star rating.
031606792X|5.0|Beautiful, amazing, best book of the series!! I loved every word! Her writing has grown in leaps and bounds! Way to go SM!
031606792X|4.0|This is my least favorite book in the series but I still liked it. I thought the marriage was too fast, the honeymoon was short on details if you catch my drift, and the pregnancy was kinda weird. I also didn't \\"feel\\" the characters so much in this book. The crazy, lustful, love between Bella and Edward just wasn't there. I started to like Jacob a lot more though after reading so many chapters from his POV. But I too didn't like the imprinting on Bella's child.<br /><br />I did like the happy ending though. Why is it that people have to go through so much suffering to get what they want in the end? Is that reality? Its not my reality. I like that she didn't have to give up children or her human family in order to be with Edward...that would have been the tragedy IMO....to leave everything and everyone you love for a man.<br /><br />I liked how Bella's power came to light and how she found that she was born to be a vampire and that Edward became more of a partner than a protector. Her power also came on so fast because she was threatened with harm to her child...any mom knows we can turn into a mean mama bear when someone threatens our cubs.<br /><br />I am happy that no one died and no one had to live with regrets and a broken heart.
031606792X|4.0|I can see both sides of the reviews on here but people please remember, it is a story!!!  I would think that Stephenie's audience does know that too.  While Breaking Dawn was not my favorite (I thought it was too drawn out at times), I still liked the story.  It did amaze me of some of the things she choose to do but isn't that the purpose of a story?  If you read the first three Twilight books, then you definitely should read this one.  Yes, it is a happy ending (you can see that from the chapter titles) and it did make me cry.  I think more so because you can feel the love in the family and in the book.
1594489505|5.0|This was a GREAT book!!! An easy read with a heart wrenching story about two women and their experiences in war torn Afghanistan. I read it in only 2 days...I just couldn't put it down!!!
031606792X|3.0|Yes, I was one of the over 30 year olds standing in line at 12:01 am for the much anticipated release of BD and yet 48 hours later, I wonder why I am still hungry for more. Don't get me wrong Stephenie Meyer packed so much information in this 700+ paged book that could satisfy the appetites of her most voracious of readers, but yet inspite the overabundance of sustenance, I still feel a bit malnourished.    SM gave me everything I wanted out of BD: Bella finally matured, Edward, who is considered 'perfect' by Bella, is actually depicted as flawed, (which is a good thing b/c it made him feel more real or 'human' to me), and Jacob found some sort of a resolution in this triangle. So, it would seem that I got everything I wanted, but yet I am still longing for more clarity. I think SM introduced too many characters that did nothing to advance the plot, and at times the plot dragged a little, especially during Bella's pregnancy. For someone who has read the first three books multiple times, I don't think I'll re-read this one.     I think the beauty of Twilight, Eclipse and New Moon is that the supernatural lives amongst the human world, a world in which the reader can easily relate.  However, BD seemed to have taken place in a completely foreign world with foreign outcomes and concepts that Bella and the reader simply had to accept with no question.     I found the blasé manner of the chararcters accepting their fate extremely irritating.  I expected more of a realistic reaction from Charlie regarding Jacob, Bella, Edward and Renesme and their situation, or perhaps upon Bella's discovery that she was pregnant... IMO Edward's reaction of Bella's pregnancy was more accurate.  (Complete Shock)    But perhaps I'm looking too deep into BD. Like I said, I got everything I wanted out of the novel as far as the outcome is concerned but yet, I still feel partially unfulfilled.
031606792X|1.0|THis is buy far worse than any fanfiction I have ever read. I will tell everyone I know to keep away from this book. It was awful and unreadable
031606792X|1.0|If it was possible to give this book 0 stars I would.  This will be short and sweet.  What I liked about Breaking Dawn:  Jacob redeeming himself and the Volturi action.<br /><br />I am mostly disappointed with the entire book though.  Breaking Dawn basically went against what we as fans knew to not be possible, even for the super natural.  As a group we defended these theories against all incoming threats on these Amazon boards and I feel we were let down in the worst way by Breaking Dawn.  Key notes that were clearly stated to be impossible, happened.  The unthinkable, happened. Disappoint, lies, and horror?  Happened.<br /><br />The saga ends at Eclipse.  In my mind, this is a trilogy.  Breaking Dawn detached itself from the series soon after we started, it's unfortunate.  I fully support Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse 100%.
B00000G6H1|4.0|This was Olivia's most daring album. This album stands the test of time because of its inovative production and interestingly structured songs about the environment getting physical and love lost. This album is a treat for Olivia's fans from the post Grease days. The album is catchy and a smoothe listen.
031606792X|3.0|I just finished this book, and while I enjoyed the story, the pedestrian writing just wore me right out.  Anyone notice how many people roll their eyes in this series?  I started noticing in book three, and so couldn't help being aware of it in Breaking Dawn.  In the first 50 pages alone, there were five eye rollings, and I stopped keeping count after that.  Everyone, it seems, rolls his or her eyes.  Shame on Meyer's editor for letting that go by.  Someone stop this writing tic before it infests Meyer's future books!
031606792X|1.0|I will not go on an on about how horrible this book is.  I will only say that it did not belong in the series.  The characters were flat and completely underdeveloped.  The plot was not well thought out.  Bella's voice was gone.  There was no tone - no style.  There were no remnants of Twilight at all.  I couldn't believe that it was the real Breaking Dawn.  Big disappointment from SM.
031606792X|1.0|I love the first three books so much that I was just dying for Breaking Dawn to come out. From the very beginning, it didn't even seem like the same writer. You found yourself not even caring what happened to the characters. Everything that was agonized over in the first three was briefly breezed over in this one.   Spoiler below  And the whole issue with the pregnancy was just plain icky! I couldn't shake the ick through the rest of the book.   I really want to just pretend this book didn't happen. It's the exact opposite of closure.
031606792X|5.0|TINY SPOILER BELOW:  I utterly adored this superb books - how it would end had an affect on the way i would view the previous parts so i was delighted with this conclusion.    I have no idea why readers wished to elicit a stronger 'message' from this tale - other than enjoying a wonderful story with a (whispered spoiler) happy ending - god forbid that everyone should get what they want in a story.  This isn't Hamlet and anyone looking for an ending fraught with terrible angst and paid pipers need look elsewhere.    I can do nothing but commend Mrs Meyer on her writing and her story - it will lighten my step for some considerable time.    Brava!
B000WCBMA8|5.0|(4.5 *'s) Nothing has rejuvenated the airwaves like The Hives' \\"Hate to Say I Told You So.\\"  Crescendo and angst about who-knows-what? Gets the answer: Who cares?  'The Black and White Album' finds the fabulous five Swedes with none of the trappings of success.  What makes this album a worthy successor to the remarkably fast-forward 'Veni, Vidi, Vicious'* is the variety.   Add to this the fact they've yet to take themselves too seriously,  and, '...Black and White...,' while not as groundbreaking, draws on an expertise that prevents any formula.  As an ABBA aficionado, The Hives covers more Swedish territory.  From slick and sweet to awesomely wild, The Hives do Scandinavia proud!      Highlights only Please!  Okay, I'll try.    1.) \\"Tick Tick Boom\\" is incredibly propulsive.  Almost matches \\"Hate to Say I Told You So.\\"  Found on recent soundtracks, including 'Jumper'. Hollywood `Get(s) Smart'.      2.) \\"You Got It All Wrong,\\" \\"Hey Little World,\\" and \\"Return the Favor\\" are expansive.  Great trajectory, yet they manage to mix it up better than The Ramones did.      3.) The whole idea is fun, so \\"Well All Right!\\" \\"You Dress up for Armageddon,\\" and \\"Square One, Here I Come\\" fill the bill.  \\"Puppet on a String\\" reinvents the wheel nicely.    4.)  \\"Big Bang Theory\\"?  \\"Try It Again,\\" \\"Won't Be Long,\\" and \\"Bigger Hole to Fill\\" are harder rockin' evidence.    5.) \\"Variety is the spice of life.\\"  \\"T.H.E. H.I.V.E.S.\\" showcase a Mick Jagger-like vocal.  Now I thought The Hives drew from The Kinks and The Dave Clark Five, but the columnists were right, there are Stones' influences.  \\"Giddy Up\\" funks it up nicely.  (Are they singing about `Urban Cowboy,' `Brokeback Mountain,' or protesting the foreign policy of President Bush?  I haven't decided yet.)  \\"A Stroll Through Hive Mansion\\" shows no false modesty:  We need an intermission, but this carnival music for a flea circus is a little too tame.  Maybe they should have consulted R.E.M. before creating an instrumental.     The Hives still are fun after all these years, but their experience only expands their already impressive repertoire.      (I know 'Tyranasaurus Hives,' came just before 'Black and White,' but I prefer to compare 'Veni Vidi Vicious'.)

0439023483|5.0|My husband, daughter, and I all read and loved this book. The main character is a strong and smart girl, but it's certainly not just a book for girls. There's a little near romance (can't wait to see what happens in books 2 an 3), but it's not just a beach read. The main thing we all love about the book is how the main character thinks things through and what she doesn't see/understand because of her youth/essential innocence. I don't want to give anything away, but this is a MUST READ for everyone who's ever (1) watched a reality tv show, (2) been a teenager, (3) thought about war, (4) thought about how to solve world hunger, or (5) liked reading! (My daughter really did say she liked this better than HP.)
B0018QCXGY|2.0|This movie gave me motion sickness and I had to stop half-way through. Story was not so interesting. Good looking girls, neat monster. 'Nough said.
031606792X|3.0|Alright, so i agree with everyone who hated this book. I gave it 3 stars because I DID want to keep reading - so at least it held my interest. But it's true, Bella really did get everything for nothing.   Jacob's imprinting was far too convenient. As was the scene where the Volturi just up and left after being so determined to have a fight. As was Bella's ability to completely deny any vampire impulses with no trouble (I mean, she was just out walking the streets of Seattle chatting up lawyers).   The entirely happy and perfect ending was somewhat irritating. Lucky for Bella that she had a kid who required NO mothering of any kind. All she had to do was hold it. It slept beautifully through the next, giving Edward and Bella plenty of time to have wild crazy sex all night. Good thing it never showed anyone memories of THOSE times.    My last complaint was Meyer's sudden interest in the gory vampireness of vampires. In the last 3 books, the most disturbing thing we read about was the death of tourists in Italy... only by implication. Here, we watch a human Bella sip human blood from a styrofoam cup and enjoy it.     So, as an 18 year old reader, I learned that...    I should probably get married soon (after all, I'm getting older and uglier all the time)     Have a kid, too.    Vampires are freakin' cool. This whole immortality thing AND perfect beauty? Awesome.        Before the book came out, I was certain that Meyer would make the book parent friendly... that is, vampires would not be on par with beautiful, gorgoues, and intelligent gods.     My mistake.
038073186X|1.0|Really bad writing. I could read through the \\"surprise\\" way before the ending. Threw the book away after that.
031606792X|1.0|There are no words to describe how awful this book is. Just... ugh. I want my money back, seriously, this was disgusting.
031606792X|2.0|I adored the first three books in the Twilight saga... but this book I found to be disappointing in so many ways. I'll get right to it. (Spoilers ahead!!!)<br /><br />The first 7 chapters screamed \\"I'm a fan fic!\\" It was so expected and so little-girl's-perfect-wedding-dream that I was bored with it. The honeymoon was just downright bizarre to me. And yes, when Bella gets pregnant things just get freaky. She's not even bothered by the idea that the baby starts kicking her minutes within realizing she's pregnant. I understand it's a fast growing vamp-baby, but she doesn't seem to react normally to this.<br /><br />I was annoyed that Stephenie skipped the time from Bella finding out she's pregnant to her home and almost full term (vampire style). I would have liked to see more of the action between Edward, Bella, and the Cullens regarding her pregnancy news.<br /><br />Then Jacob takes over, and it gets better. I didn't think I'd like this section of the book, but Jacob's narration was a relief after those fan-ficy first 7 chapters. There's some uproar among the werewolves regarding the Cullens, Bella, and the pregnancy. And this is where I should have realized... this is where Stephenie started her little trend. Every time a problem in the book arises, everytime it gets slightly suspenseful - everything magically works out in another 15-20 pages! In fact, everything in Bella's life is now magical and wonderful and perfect. Breaking Dawn establishes a strong and annoying pattern of this.<br /><br />Bella's birthing scene reminded me of something out of the movie The Exorcist. When the baby finally comes, Bella has the AUDACITY to name the poor child Renesmee... ?!?! Seriously, Stephenie? Like, for real? Jacob and Bella have a brief confrontation which uncomfortably reminded me of a nasty custody battle. But not between two parents, between a vampire and werewolf. One the mother, the other the lover (because Jacob conveniently imprints on Renesmee, Stephenie's way of trying to solve the Edward vs. Jacob battle among fans). Bella is enraged at Jacob for nicknaming the child \\"Nessie\\". Um, actually, Bella, Jacob is doing us ALL a big favor here. Cause the name RENESMEE sucks.<br /><br />The novel continues on in it's typical form, all the little problems we fans were looking forward to are solved so easily. They seem like cop-outs to me. Really? Can everything just work out this perfectly?<br /><br />There's plenty of bits and pieces of Edward and Bella's lust for each other, and all the beautiful, wonderful things about their lives. The end of the book is basically the same form. No huge climax. I can't believe Stephenie did this to us. After Twilight (a wonderfully romantic suspense novel), then New Moon (where Edward disappears for pretty much the whole thing, leaving us on edge), and then the showdown in Eclipse... and the fourth book... this is all you've got?<br /><br />I'm hoping they'll announce on the news tomorrow that they accidentally sent the wrong copy of Breaking Dawn to the printing press. That this was mistakenly sold, this book which is basically Stephenie's fan fic that's just all too perfect to be at all exciting. But it's not. Bummer. I was expecting so much more. Instead, it seems like Stephenie was just desperate to give the fans what she *thought* they wanted. Some perfect little fairy tale. It was not Twilight-esque at all.<br /><br />Oh well. It was entertaining in a lot of places, but also sickeningly sweet in others. Just not what I think the fans wanted.Jacob battle among fans).

B000XA5K48|1.0|This movie ranks up there with \\"Ultraviolet\\" and \\"The Thin Red Line\\" as the worst movies I've seen.   Mindless action is cool with me but the action isn't even good.    The plot is non-existent, yet it still manages to be political in a very immature, childish way.  It had a few funny moments, but overall it was a really stupid movie.
B001BKV9TE|5.0|It was lots of fun, had cool visuals and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Much more than I expected to, as we did realize it would be horribly inaccurate when we saw the trailors. But if you watch it as fantasy there is no problems at all.
031606792X|1.0|I was so excited for Breaking Dawn to come out.  I was in love with the twilight series, and I recommended it to almost everyone, and all of my friends were reading them.  As soon as I heard the fourth was coming out, I started counting down the days.  I couldn't wait.  I looked at the website everyday for quotes, and my cousin and I spent a lot of time talking about what we thought would happen, and our ideas.    SPOILERS-  This book was probably the worst book I've ever read.  The first couple of chapters were nice, I expected the wedding and everything and I was happy with that.  Then as soon as they went to Isle Esme, I just totally gave up on Edward and Bella.  Bella was some sex-crazed lunatic, and Edward got frustrated at everything!  I was expecting it to be like a dream honeymoon now that they were finally married, but I just ended up wishing they stuck to Bella falling asleep in her room with Edward singing to her.    Then as soon as I found out Bella was pregnant, I got pissed off.  Meyers said that vampires CAN\\"T have children, meaning that the men can't either. If she wanted Bella to get pregnant in the 4th book, she should've mentioned that it was possible in the other books.  I was upset that this happened because the whole book revolved around how the half-vampire baby was killing Bella.  Jacob was the only character I liked, until he imprinted on BELLA\\"S BABY! Edward turned into a ghost figure, he was just felt so not there, Bella was totally not herself, Carlisle was stupider than Jacob when it came to the knowing what to do about the baby. I didn't even read 200 pages, I skimmed through everything because I was so bored and disgusted with this book.  I didn't ever want to pick it up and start reading, I forced myself to see what happened.  I probably won't buy midnight sun now (which I was excited for as well) and the entire series was totally ruined for me.  I wish I hadn't read this book.    by the end of the book, I couldn't care less whether or not Bella and Edward were happy together forever, when during the other books all I wished for was for them to be happy.. Since the characters changed into people I didn't care about, I totally didn't care whether they died, honestly.    I loved stephenie meyer, and I feel terrible writing this review.
031606792X|3.0|I was very grateful that this book wraps up a lot of loose ends, but this  book did not go the way I'd expected. I was highly against Bella turning into a vampire since she would be turning her back on all her human family and friends. It was really selfish of Edward to change her, and I couldn't understand why Bella begged for immortality ( but while she was undergoing the change, she mentioned how she'd rather die than to stand the burning pain)  One thing I have to mention is that this book in no way promotes teen pregnancy at all! If anything, Bella waited to have sex with the one she truly loves, which is a good message more teens should listen to. The baby... was an accident, but she at once she became responsible for her actions. She was a good mother who loved her child and never once abandoned Nessie. Teen pregnancies happen, it's a part of life, but according to law, Bella is officially an ADULT. People need to stop making it sound like having a child at 18 is horrible. It's not like Bella was 13 yrs old and pregnant!    Jacob imprinting finally happened! thank god! but in no ways does it relate to pedophilia. Pedophilia is a disorder where adults sexually prefer children than adults. In the book it mentions that Jacob's imprinted feelings for Nessie were not sexual in any way! He didn't have any sexual urges for nessie, but the reader can clearly see that jacob did love her. Before calling it pedophilia, maybe some of you should google what the mental disease truly is before labeling jake as a child molester.    in conclusion.....this book didn't really do it for me. I wish Meyer has taken another path, but like I'd stated before, I'm grateful for the saga to finally end with a happily ever after. I'm happy to know that Bella and Edward will live their lives together forever and ever and ever :D
031606792X|4.0|The ending of the Twilight saga is pretty satisfying but the plot in this book is not one of \\"bestselling\\" books. If this were a stand alone book, this book would not sell as good as it is right now. Breaking Dawn doesn't seem to be your typical Twilight book. The previous three books are more satisfying and when you are reading it, you would be absorbed, but this one, as good as it is, would not be remembered as one of the best books ever written. Twilight (1st book) is always going to be remembered as one of the best books ever written, but with Breaking Dawn, it would just be counted as an ordinary book. I just think the plot isn't as strong as the other books, especially the first, and the romance in this novel just doesn't feel as romantic that would get to excited as it would from the first book.<br /><br />Overall, this novel is recommended to Twilight saga fans since it concludes the whole series, but if you are reading this as a stand alone book, I suggest you don't. This is novel is nothing like any Harry Potter book where you can skip ahead and read one book and get hooked.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I only discovered this series about 2 months ago, and was very eager for the release of Breaking Dawn.  As a \\"not so young\\" adult, I found the content of this book maybe a little too \\"mature\\" for the intended audience.      Many people complain about the UNreality of it all, did you all forget this is a fantasy and a fairy tale in one?  Anything can happen, and it did.      There are many deeper emotional reasons for everything that happens in this book. These emotions may be too complicated for younger readers, since they haven't experienced any of these situations (or in the case of the vampire thing, none of us have).  They may not understand the emotions of true love, marriage, pregnancy, and parenthood.  All this and throw in a bunch of vampires and werewolves.  I may be hard to get a grasp on.    If you go into this book expecting certain things to happen, you will be disappointed.  But this isn't YOUR book, this is Stephenie's book, her story.  And she surprised us all with the twists.  I really hoped for a happy ending for all, and that is what I got.  How it got there was a little more \\"interesting\\" than we all expected, but in the end, I loved it!
031606792X|1.0|Honestly, just borrow the book from your friend. Or if you're into illegal activities, find an upload of it on the internet. This is the worst book I have ever had the (dis)pleasure of attempting to read and I am glad that I didn't waste a cent on it. And this is coming from someone who reads 10 cent romance novels for fun.    Also, for all those sad, pathetic creatures who think Bella and Edward's relationship is ideal -- have fun with your future abusive boyfriends. Hey, as long as he's as attractive as the dazzling Edward Cullen, I guess it doesn't matter that he controls your every move and treats you like a child!
031606792X|5.0|I don't have a ton of time to devote to this review (having spent all of my free time devouring the book) but after reading so many negative reviews I had to pipe in to say that I, for one, loved it.  I have enough reality in my actual life that I was going to pitch a fit if everything didn't work out gloriously over-the-top well for Bella and the Cullens.  This isn't high-minded literature, it's fantasy and romance.  It's happy fluff and I love it for that.      I felt like there were a couple of things that were inconsistent with earlier books (sex for vampires was definitely downplayed before--none of this \\"the other Cullens were getting it on 10 hours a day while I was reading\\" stuff, the jumping out of windows/around with trees seemed an obvious attempt to make those scenes in the Twilight movie seem less out-of-place, Edward being fertile is a giant stretch, among other things), but...like I said, this series is FUN.  It's not a morality tale, it's not Literature with a capital L, and it's not supposed to be grounded in reality (or else it wouldn't be about vampires).  It is what it is, and I loved it!
031606792X|5.0|I think that the book was an amazing. The perfect end to the series. People are saying that everything ended too happy and it wasn't like reality, HELLO PEOPLE? Have you read the books, of course its not like reality. The book was awesome and I really hope that she changes her mind and continues to write about Bella And Edward and all the other new additions to the Cullen family     A+ Book   A+++++ Series
031606792X|3.0|I've never bothered to write a review on a novel before, mostly because I believe you should read something for yourself. That's the beauty of fiction, to get lost in a story and draw your own conclusions. But in light of these SCATHING reviews, I felt compelled.  I too was bitten by the Twilight Saga and passed the beauty of it on to as many people as I could.   I had extraordinary expectations for Breaking Dawn - based on what I fantasized would happen with my beloved Edward and Bella, and to that end, I was disappointed. The book did have a different cadence than the others, a different feel. (I also read The Host, it seemed more in line with that.) I can only assume related to the fact that writer believed the audience was maturing with her characters.   As usual, the circumstances were...extraordinary and the characters response to them I perceived to be, well, out of character.   I was frustrated by the book, initially. But once I let that go, once I let go of what I wanted for the characters and gave myself over to what the writer created for the characters - HER characters that she was gracious enough to share with me, I was able to appreciate it for what it was - a well written, suspenseful tale, that did not fall in line with my version of happily ever after, but fit hers. And I could see the beauty in that.   I encourage you to re-read it or read it for the first time but let go of preconceived notions of how you wished things to end, and go with how story. Think of the events in context of the other books and not your own imagination. (Hard with characters this beloved - but try) There are story lines she set up in Twilight that she brilliantly concluded in Breaking Dawn.   Also realize, although it's fiction, it's based in some sort of reality and this book is from Stephanie Meyers perspective, not your own. And also, just like real life - things don't always end as you hoped they would.    It's equally stunning to me that people viewed this as a lessonfor their daughters...it shouldn't be. It should be escapism that helps them tap into their love of reading...not a guideline for heavens sake. No one wants their daughter falling in love with someone who could kill her, no matter how sparkling, he may be.
031606792X|1.0|*SPOILERS AHEAD*    I was afraid, while reading this book, that I would be alone in thinking that it was awful. Now, bear in mind, that I read and enjoyed the first three books. I was interested to see how Meyer would wrap up her series, even though I didn't think there needed to be another book after Eclipse. And, wow, was I right.     Breaking Dawn is, hands down, the worst book that I have ever read. I spent 3 years working for Barnes and Noble and 2 years working in libraries. I have been an avid reader my entire life, picking up books and reading them cover to cover, even if they were poorly written or had storylines I didn't quite approve of. And I cannot think of a book that I have ever read that was worse than Breaking Dawn.     Now, I have no qualms with Meyer's religion or the fact that she preaches her lifestyle (as a 20-something wife and mother) through this book. I find it sad that she couldn't see outside of her little bubble long enough to think that maybe getting married at 18 wasn't the best choice for Bella (who, before she met Edward, was a smart, independent young woman). But even once I got past the fact that Bella was rushed into marriage with Edward (and didn't seem very happy about it and was doing it mostly against her will), I was hit with a whole new set of problems.     Two words.     Vampire. Baby.     Never in all my years of reading supernatural romance or any other kind of fiction have I ever encountered anything so ridiculous. The Renesmee plot was something straight out of the dregs of FanFiction.net. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if Meyer had just run out of ideas and plagiarized the entirety of Breaking Dawn from a 13 year old fangirl's online story.     God forbid you were a fan of Jacob because he just sits back and lets everything happen because he \\"loves Bella that much.\\" God forbid you were a fan of Alice because she disappears a few chapters in only to make little appearances to remind you that she's the best character in the story. God forbid you liked Bella with a brain in her head because she loses it somewhere around the time she realizes that she's three months pregnant after having sex once.     I am ashamed to have read this book. I am ashamed to have spent $14 (which, now, I think would have been better spent rotting my brain with a Gossip Girl book, for goodness sake) on it. I plan on donating this book, along with the previous three, to Goodwill. Because if this is what Stephenie Meyer was leading up to over the last few novels, then I don't want to think about them.     Shame on you, Stephenie Meyer. Shame on you, Little Brown. And shame on us for being led like sheep into this disgusting foray of self-indulgent soap opera of crap.

031606792X|4.0|*****Possible Spoilers*****  Although I do wish it this book give Edward the depth he usually had in the other three books, I was pretty happy with this one. It is fiction, and it gave you the happy ending, of course in real life we know that this is usually not the case, and we usually have struggle, pain, and loss. I liked that Bella did in fact have her wishes come true, even if it was in an unusual way.    I love that Bella went from the helpless whiny thing that she was in the first three books, to a more mature secure person, from standing up to Edward to keep the baby, to being a newborn vampire who shows restraint, and strength.    But then again I also thought the name Renesmee was kinda cheesy, and that Jacob should have gone off with Leah, and they could make a life with eachother and fall in love by choice, not imprint.To me though, it was still a great read, and I felt it tied up the loose ends.
0375507256|5.0|It's rare these days to come across an new, original masterpiece.  It's a tough book to write a review of because there are so many incredible surprises and I don't want to create any spoilers - but the writing, the brilliance is so extraordinary - my advice is just read the book before reading this review further, but if you feel you need to know more, here you go:    This book is about \\"its structure\\", which consists of 6 stories, 5 of which are divided in half and placed around the 6th.  The book is mostly about power, slavery, hatred and violence, and yet is full of humor and truly enjoyable to read.  Each of the 6 stories is written in a different style - one is a diary, another is a series of letters, another is a pulp fiction novel, one is an autobiography (of which a character in a later story views the movie version of), one is an interview, one is an \\"oral history\\".  Each of the stories is also a document featured in a later stories - for example, in the second story, the first story is discovered in the library.  Also, the stories are critiqued in each other - in the second story, the problems and inconsistencies of the first story are pointed out.  There are other themes and links, from birthmarks to names to ships.  It never seems artificial or contrived however. The stories span centuries and cultures, although many of them center on or relate to the Big Island in Hawaii.    Some of the reading is difficult - the middle story is written in the author's own created futuristic dialect (shoes are called \\"nikes\\" for instance), which sometimes takes a while.  The initial story is difficult to follow at times, and the book requires a fair amount of concentration.  Much of the book is surprisingly exciting and interesting.  I've never read anything quite like it.

0385340990|5.0|The reasons people join book clubs are numerous --- to meet people, to find common bonds through literature, to share neighborhood gossip, to exchange favorite authors or dessert recipes. But perhaps no reading group has had a genesis as dramatic as the one that gave birth to the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society.<br /><br />Guernsey is one of the Channel Islands, nominally part of Great Britain but located in the English Channel, close enough to see mainland Europe with the naked eye. And, as the residents of Guernsey discover during World War II, close enough for the Germans to occupy. What started out as a layover during an intended full-out invasion of the British Isles resulted in a five-year occupation that changed the lives of these quiet, simple people forever.<br /><br />In the novel, the title literary club is formed, literally, in self-defense. Caught heading home late after curfew (following a highly illegal dinner of roast pork from a pig missed by the Germans' inventory), an eclectic group of villagers makes up an excuse on the spot --- they were so engrossed by their literary discussion, they improvise, that they completely lost track of time. Of course, in order to validate their cover story, the \\"members\\" have to stage actual subsequent meetings, sometimes featuring creative desserts such as Potato Peel Pie (about the only dessert they could make with the limited supplies available to the near-starving islanders). To their surprise, especially since several of the group's members had never read a book before, the club soon sparks a genuine love of reading, as well as some intense literary debates.<br /><br />Shortly after the war's end, one of the society's members, a pig farmer named Dawsey Adams, grows intrigued by the writings of 18th-century essayist Charles Lamb and, on a whim, decides to write to the former owner of his used volume, Juliet Ashton, to see if she can help him find more works by Lamb. Juliet, who had become a bestselling columnist and author during and after the war, soon begins corresponding with Dawsey and the other Society members. Friendship, compassion and a sense of discovering new stories about the war draws Juliet and the Guernsey islanders together. Juliet hopes to include their stories in a new series of newspaper columns, or maybe as part of a new book --- but even this astute cultural critic and social commentator does not anticipate the role these humble people will play in her own personal story.<br /><br />THE GUERNSEY LITERARY AND POTATO PEEL PIE SOCIETY is the result of a unique collaboration between Mary Ann Shaffer, a debut novelist who passed away earlier this year, and her niece, children's author Annie Barrows. (Barrows helped complete the book when Shaffer's health became too poor.) The epistolary format of the novel is well-suited to this collaborative approach, as the letters between Juliet and her various correspondents serve as a sort of conversation that reveals character, history and the subtle secrets letter writers give away without even knowing it.<br /><br />Although the novel is ultimately heartwarming (and what reader doesn't love a book about the redemptive power of books and reading?), it doesn't shy away from exploring some of the darker aspects of the war, including the cruelty of some German soldiers, the vulnerability of others and the horrors of the concentration camps. With a broad but well-developed cast of characters, a unique storytelling method and a firm grounding in a little-known front of World War II, THE GUERNSEY LITERARY AND POTATO PEEL PIE SOCIETY will certainly spark lively discussion and moments of self-recognition at book clubs and literary societies everywhere.<br /><br />  --- Reviewed by Norah Piehlduring and after the war, soon begins corresponding with Dawsey and the other Society members.

031606792X|4.0|This book may not be my favorite in the series  however it had its good points.  I know many people are angry adn leaving poor reviews due to there personal expectations.  So let's look at the story for what it is BElla's ending.    I think Bella played a little differently in this book then she had in the past.  Her human story was very short and very much Bella then we get to vampire Bella andI feel the character change a bit adn taht is not a bad thing.  THere were some parts in BElla'svampire discovery that I thought went a little too slow but that is minor.    I loved Jacob's Book.  I think showing things from his pov gave the story an entirely new dimension.  Jacob sees thjings very differently and allows us to see the other chracters reactions to things.  I think Jacob should have been a little different with the imprint situation.  I feel like he just gave in he wasn't upset and there was no thoughts on it from Edward which was strange.  I guess he can see how Jacob is feeling but still.THe Volturi war was good but a little more action amy ahv ebeen cool.    Overall I think the book was good and ended much in the way people were looking for even if it wasn't exactly what they wanted.  I like the book and definitely reccommend it.
031606792X|1.0|I am going to tag this as a spoiler alert because I want to make sure that anyone who does want to read this book (and I dont know why.. I know I wish I hadn't) that they are not spoiled...    First off let me just say that I adored all of the other twilight books. I waited with baited breath for this one to come out so i could read it...     I started reading it and i was immediately turned off by the book.  I told my mom that I wished I could take it back, that it was that bad.  I who read Harry Potter in one day fell asleep while trying to read this book.    I agree with what everyone was saying... The characters are not the same.  Edward wanting to keep Bella happy at all costs, Alice leaving her family and not telling anyone why ( though I understand that to a point), Carlisle the great doctor not realizing that the baby wanted blood, and etc..    I did like the wedding and the honeymoon but that was about it    SM turned Bella into a vampire way to quickly.. I thought it would happen at the very end, and she built up for so long that Bella would be a newborn and be thirsty for a few years just to have Bella completely skip over that part? What was the point in them fighting the newborns and us learning all about them in Eclipse?      Don't even get me started on Bella being a baby and Jacob imprinting on that baby.  It was beyond dumb and I am not going to say Unrealistic because lets face it, vampires and werewolves are unrealistic.      Jacob was also a big problem for me... He spends half of the novel upset and pining for Bella \\"The Love of His Life\\", he couldnt even stand her wedding.... Than Bella has a baby and he is all like \\"Bella Who?\\" He imprints of the daugther that he wanted to be the father of.. he wanted her to have his children and now he wants to imprint on one of them? Disgusting!!      I have a 12 yr old Niece that i have been lending these books too.. I am trying to figure out a way of not letting her read this one...      For me Eclipse isthe end of the saga... This one should just be thrown away!
031606792X|5.0|I can understand a little dissension about Stephenie Meyer's final book in the Twilight Saga due to its slightly new style and point of view. But for all the fans who love and UNDERSTAND the characters in the Twilight Series, Bella's story is concluded nicely. While this last installment wasn't my favorite book in the Twilight series, I read it with the same fervor and enthusiasm due to Meyer's amazing ability to draw the reader into the story and more importantly the characters. While there were aspects of the book I found odd or unbecoming, the story was well received and reflective of the way the characters would think and act, were they real people.    The book is broken up into three \\"Books\\": the first from Bella's perspective, then Jacob's, then Bella's again. I enjoyed reading the final book the most as it was the most untraditional. Meyer seemed to throw the traditional story arc out the window and the main conclusion seemed to come before the final conflict. It also gave new insight into the world Meyer has created. For this and other reasons I found this book to be the most intriguing. The second book however, is my favorite. It feels more like and true to the other novels in the Twilight Saga (despite the different perspective). I also love the Meyer's way of entitling chapters changes as her character perspective changes. Jacob's chapter titles are one of my favorite things about this novel.    (Spoilers Below)    I would most like to say that I approve of nearly every controversial decision Meyer made in this final installment. Twilight was always meant to be Bella's fairytale and thus, it is more than acceptable for the final book to have a fairytale ending. Meyer's Description of Bella's newborn life before the final conflict emerges shows that even in a happy, blissful vampire-marriage, Bella and Edward's eternity will still be marred by the conflicts and problems of parenthood and everyday life. She ended the book with Bella's happiness in a \\"piece\\"of her and Edward's eternity. While Meyer sometimes takes the happy ending to the point of cliché (such as with Jacob imprinting on Nessie allowing Vampires, Wolf-shifters, Bella, Edward, Jacob and Nessie to all be one big happy family) its perfect for the fairy-tale that Twilight always was.    Jacob's imprinting, while cliché, is appropriate. If Bella truly was the object of HIS fairytale, this would have been a love-story about a human girl and a werewolf. But Bella is obviously not Jacob's true soul-mate. He is only her Best Man. There is still something missing from Bella that makes her imperfect for him (in some way). Therefore, it is only fitting that Bella's daughter, would be the true object of his desire as the person in the world most like Bella in all the ways that Jacob loves. Additionally, Nessie has kinship with Jacob that she doesn't share with her parents, her heat, ability to sleep, and her diet(s) are all things she shares with Jacob. Her superhuman strength/invulnerability also make her a good match for Jake that allow her to fit in better with the pack. Any human Jake would have been with would always be in danger of being the next Emily.    I love that Meyer's \\"final battle\\" never happened. The fact that there was no fight with the Volturi allowed Meyer to avoid bloodshed for her characters while still being realistic within the confines of the story. It also allowed her a place to continue from should she wish to return to the Cullen universe at a later point in time.    I'm happy with Bella's new ability. It is an extension of the ability she had as a human and therefore, fits perfectly. I am especially happy that her extended power works both ways allowing for a truly romantic and fairy-tale moment between Bella and Edward in the final pages.    My only real criticism of this final novel is that Stephenie did not endow Bella with the ability to name her child well. Had her parents had better names, the idea might have been acceptable. (Carlie is really cute actually) But Renesmee is the most absurd name in Meyer's series. I took to Jacob's nickname immediately and I'm glad everyone else did too. Even Edward seemed to realize that Renesmee is a horrible name and and quite quickly took to calling her Nessie.    While this book is different, I feel it is a satisfying conclusion to a beautiful story with beautiful developed characters.
B001AW9DKK|1.0|I saw the boys at Woodstock and had all of the early music and much of the middle music with their individual/group efforts. I think Weld is a terrific listen - Neil Young plays a mean guitar.

I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this to anyone.

Axel Sheffler's illustrations are whimsical (My son has noticed that most of the insects he draws have noses)and beautiful.  I am especially fond of its rhyming, making it a delight to read.  Most of all, I love the messages it contains.  One of which is that the world is vast and wonderful and we should get out and experience it.  Also, it stresses the importance of helping one another, and being kind to our environment.  A big nod goes out to The Snail and the Whale and its creators for giving us a book which is not only wonderful to look at and read, but has a valuable message.  Thanks!

Supernatural is really getting a hang of things thank GOD people are realizing it I wouldn't want it to be cancelled since I can't watch it on TV I buy the DVDs hopefully thats enough to keep the show around forever or at least hundreds of more episodes. Sad however that it isn't in any category of this years teen choice awards!!! Keep the show alive guys, buy Supernatural stuff!!! I don't want the same to happen like SMALLVILLE :( (8th season is its last)    **10th became Smallivlle's last season

0316067601|5.0|I read this book in less than 24 hours, I usually can't read more than 10 pages at a time in any good book, but I just couldn't put it down. You must sit down with a full box of tissues. This book should be required reading for every single American, it will change your life, as it has mine. I am upset at the reviews from the book club people who said that Luttrell should have gotten a better co-writer. That is crap. This book is raw and authentic, out the mouth of a real American hero, just the way it ought to be. Hoorah!
031606792X|5.0|I can't begin to understand the people who don't give this book 5 stars.  Stephenie wrote a beautiful book with full of suspense. It had a beautiful ending. The only thing I'm upset about is that the book had to end. This will be a book that I read over and over.<br /><br />I'd say more... but I don't want to give any spoilers.
031606792X|2.0|I was not a fan of this book.  Through the entire series, I've felt that Meyer uses 20 words when 2 will do - and this book felt just bloated and way too long.  Although finally it was interesting to get a second point of view besides Bella's, there was no real action at all in this book.  All of it was anticipation.  And I agree that it was a complete Cop Out for Jacob to imprint on the baby.<br /><br />Honestly, I think the first one worked so well because it was all angsty teen forbidden love.  Even the second book was interesting because it dealt with something that the target audience could relate to - breaking up and feeling like your world ends.  But once Meyer went to the \\"myth\\" of all those extra vampires and Italian judges, etc., it felt like she got lost and had to find a way out.<br /><br />And was anyone else annoyed that there was no real fighting in the book?  There are so many comparisons of Meyer to JK Rowling and I have to completely disagree.  Rowling is a much better author, and she's mature enough to know that happily ever after doesn't mean everything gets wrapped up in a pretty bow - I mean, half the cool characters died in HP7.<br /><br />Finally, I still would like to know what the appeal of Bella is.  Again, in the first book she was interesting, but she got less so as the books went on.<br /><br />I'm sorry that this book was not as good as I'd hoped it would be.  Kind of want my money back.
031606792X|5.0|The book, just like the rest was very subtly building, and was very had to put down.

Bella getting pregnant? Really now? SMeyer totally went against her own book. She's stated many, many times that vampires cannot have children. Well, obviously they can. Everyone - except Jacob and Emmett - was OOC, as well.     What was with the name?! RENESMEE CARLIE CULLEN? I don't blame everyone for calling her Nessie.    Bella became more of a Mary-Sue, and Nessie was even more than her. Everyone loooves her! Of course they have to! She's one of a kind.     Then Jacob imprinting on Nessie, just made it even worse. That does not satisfy all the Jacob/Bella shippers out there. Trust me.
0307269191|5.0|I have not read any of Murakami's novels (this may change soon), but in his short stories he often employs subtle nostalgia for his characters' pasts. Often this nostalgia blurs the line with philosophy, and after reading What I Talk About When I Talk About Running, it became apparent why Murakami enjoys crafting his fiction this way: his style of writing mirrors his perspective on life. After traveling the world, training for and participating in marathons and triathlons, Murakami wants to share his runner's experiences and how they have molded him and his perspective on life. He presents us with a thought-provoking and entertaining narrative (some of it culled from journal entries and old magazines articles he wrote years ago, but most of it original stuff).<br /><br />The book is 1/3 travelogue, 1/3 self-help, and 1/3 runners guide. We read about the running environments and typical weather patterns where Murakami has trained: New York, Boston, Japan, Greece. We read about the mental discipline and courage it takes to be a long-distance runner. But, most of all, subtly emerging on each page, we read about Murakami the philosopher. His favorite topic is the merciless and stubborn passage of time and its effects on the body and mind. He writes candidly about his thoughts on training as he grows older (Murakami was in his late 50s when he wrote much of the book). He writes about what he thinks about as he runs (ususally nothing); he writes about discipline. To paraphrase one of Murakami's favorite quotes (I forget the source): \\"...pain is inevitable; suffering is optional.\\"<br /><br />Murakami tells us that he was neither a natural novelist nor runner. He has had to work hard at both, but both are things which require a steady effort, skills with which Murakami prides himself. As we read along, we learn about Murakami's start as a novelist, his love for baseball, his strong character, and how he applied his strong character to defy his friends and relatives and open a restaurant, become a writer, and eventually, a marathon runner (even once running a 62-mile ultra-marathon). He had opened a restaurant before he became a writer, but one day, after the success of his first novel, he decided to close the restaurant and become a professional writer. It was at this time when he also decided to start running and quit smoking (in that order).<br /><br />Although the chronology of the book might be a little out of order (the book is not structured chronologically), and this might throw a few more traditional readers, this wasn't a problem. The translation seemed genuine (although I can't read Japanese!), as the translator kept all of the little Murakami-isms one would expect: little phrases such as \\"...as I mentioned before,\\" or little tangents into the second person. The style remains informal throughout.<br /><br />Despite its ostensible subject matter (running), this is a book for everyone, because its real subject matter is not about running -- it's about how Murakami gathers meaning from life. Using a master's touch, he shows us how this meaning derives from his simple act of running each day. I, for one, became inspired.ecome a writer, and eventually, a marathon runner (even once running a 62-mile ultra-marathon).

031606792X|5.0|I have read many, many of the reviews here, and I wanted to weigh in with my own experience of Breaking Dawn as a thoroughly satisfying  end to [Bella's narration of] the Twilight series.     I'm not sure what to make of the negative reviews, except to note that I have observed this trend in other fandoms when an author or director makes a partially unpopular decision.  Fans who have until that moment been wildly supportive, feverishly enthusiastic, turn spiteful and mean in their disappointment.  And I do understand the disappointment, although in this particular case I do not share it.      I'm fascinated by the common mention of fan fiction in these reviews; a number of people have said that Breaking Dawn reads like fan fiction.  (Which is of course the pleasure of fan fiction...that readers are free to reinvent stories and endings and even characters to their liking.)  But whether it reads like fan fiction, this is Meyer's end to Meyer's series, and I respect the choices she made.  All of them, I think, are understandable both within the universe she has created and within the development of healthy friendships and passionate marriages.    This is not a knee-jerk \\"it's just a book\\" comment.  Stories are powerful, and powerful stories--which is how many people seem to have experienced the Twilight books--carry all kinds of messages that their authors did not intend.  But Stephenie Meyer is not responsible to send a certain message about abstinence or teenage pregnancy or young marriage or independence.  She is only responsible for telling the story she wants to tell, and telling it with integrity.  This, I feel, she did.    Without spoiling, I will say that yes, the characters change in this last book: they must.  As people grow, their relationships grow; as people transform, their relationships transform.  I, for one, found the changes in all three of the major characters--Bella, Edward, and Jacob--believable, satisfying, and moving.    Oh, and all the quibblingabout Renesmee as a name?  In this day and age, when people are constantly inventing new names?  Come on.  It's not that bad.

006097625X|5.0|Okay, this is seriously one of the most brilliant books I have ever read, and I have Henry (who is also brilliant) to thank for introducing this to me. (Thank you, Henry.) Although this book has been around since '93, I suspect it's nowhere near as recognized as it deserves to be, but with time that will change, I hope.<br /><br />The full title is \\"Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art,\\" and what Scott McCloud does is explain what we take almost completely for granted, not just about comics, which he convincingly raises to a fine art, but also about the way we 'see,' and think we see, the world around us, especially as it is represented in words and images.<br /><br />It's an important book because he talks in deceptively simple terms about how we perceive reality. McCloud shows the reader, through the seemingly \\"childish\\" mechanism of comics, how we think about what we perceive. Therefore, it's an epistemological text, and those are always of tremendous interest to me. It's also a book about how creativity works, and that's a central theme to my research. I've spent most of my adult life dealing with 90% of what he encapsulates in 215 densely packed (and highly entertaining) pages. Did I mention that the entire work is written in the form of a comic book? No? Well, it is.<br /><br />It purports to be about comics, but that is only the tip of the philosophical iceberg. It's a study of how to think about words and images, and how we have come to use them, not just in Western society, but also in the East. He calls this the \\"invisible art,\\" the effect of the combination of words and pictures, and if you read this, you'll get a much better understanding of the term \\"closure,\\" which is the phenomenon of what the brain does when interpreting the gaps between words and pictures (in comics, this gap is represented visually by the space between each frame of words and images). We make up a story in our minds to close this gap, and it's a crucial piece of the story-telling process, this 'silence' that leads the reader to decide what really happens.<br /><br />Scott McCloud combines semiotics (the discussion of the meaning of signs and signifiers), art history, rhetorical analysis (why it's so brilliant), cognitive and neurological research (another reason it's so brilliant), with an analysis of art and literature's influence on human social dynamics. The synthesis he reaches makes the invisible, visible, and will help the reader understand how comics evolved and where they come from. Hopefully, it will give the reader a new appreciation for the comics art form.<br /><br />I have studied the theory behind virtually every aspect of what he's talking about, except comics, and so I know the sources he's relying on to get to the information he's condensed for the reader, and I also know you won't like those sources, but you will like this book because it's accessible in a way semiotics, rhetorical analysis, and the finer points of art history, are not.

031606792X|1.0|I loved the first three books.  True, they're really not well written (if you can't agree to this, you really should read a few classics or something), but the story was pretty good.  At least it was pretty good in the first three books.    SPOILERS!!!    This book threw out so many twists and turns and nothing even came to fruition in the end.  Renesmee?  I don't even have words to describe the disappointment with this curve-ball.  And then there's Renesmee/Jacob?  Sure, we got a little bit used to this with whatshisname and his toddler-imprint, but we didn't have to hear about it for 300 pages without a break.  And everyone just accepted Bella and Edward and their little mutant-baby?  And the Volturi just walked away?  It was so unrealistic, even for a book that had already moved so far away from believable.    I would've stopped reading if I hadn't thought that maybe, just maybe, it would turn around and have some kind of redeeming quality.. But even the \\"happy ending\\" was terrible to me.  Sure, the book had a few sweet moments, a few funny lines... But when it's nearly 800 pages long, it should have a lot more than that.    Most of the time it felt like fanfiction, but now that I'm finished it, I'm sure that I could find better fanfiction somewhere.    To me, the \\"Twilight Saga\\" is now just going to be the \\"Twilight Trilogy.\\"
031606792X|3.0|This book was...odd, to say the least. Not completely bad but not nearly as good as the previous ones. It wrapped up okay, if not too perfectly.     ~SPOILERS~    Why must readers hate Bella immediately in the book? It was frustrating to start off that way, forced to deal with all her whining about her perfectly planne wedding that she didn't even have to lift a finger for?     The relationship with Edward and Bella just vaporized. The honeymoon that should have been insightful and uplifting fell flat and then buried itself with news of Bella's pregnancy! Then Bella goes and throws herself at Rose who, I dearly wanted to redeem herself, but ended up remaining flat. As for Jasper, Emmett and Esme, don't expect their character's to gain depth.    The middle part out of Jacob's point of view was pretty good though what Bella says to him doesn't sound like Bella. And urgh-the gore you endure in the end. Parts of Saw drifted into my mind.    But Bella as a vampire...that is where the book picked up. I actually don't care that it turned out that Bella didn't act like a newborn, because I couldn't have endured her whining about it. She seems to have matured slightly or changed. I only wish they described more of vampire life.      I enjoyed her new trials and her friendship with Jacob though I shuddered at every mention of Renesmee (I hate the name) and how it seemed like a chunk of Bella's relationship with Edward flew into her mother/daughter one. Jacob's imprinting of her daughter was strange but I dealt with it. Dealing with Charlie was bleh, but I was fine because she didn't whine as much.       Now the vampires that come to visit and witness...I loved it. It was so amazing to see how they trained, hunted, and organized their powers. It felt like life was picking up. The meeting with the Volturi was okay, I did actually want a battle or some hint of violence.     So, all in all it was just okay. The romance between Bella and Edward never picked up again but the endingwas just satisying enough that readers can sleep at night.
031606792X|1.0|This has honestly got to be the most disappointing sequel/ end to a series that I have ever read in my life. When I got to the end, I wanted to cringe. The entire book felt like it wasn't even written by the same author as the others. I would suggest that any fan should not read this book. It ruins the entire story.<br />Now I'll be anxiously awaiting the upcoming sequel to [[ASIN:0142410500 Walk of the Spirits]] by Richie Tankersley Cusick. Her last series was amazing and it'll be refreshing to see a GOOD sequel after this dud.
031606792X|5.0|I understand some people's feeling that this is a different book that the others in the series but I absolutely disagree that it was a complete failure.  As another reviewer said, this is Bella's fairytale so having a happy ending is just fine by me and seems appropriate.  Would you have preferred suffering and pain over everyone's happiness? I don't quite understand that logic.  Is it realistic that all of this ended so perfectly, of course not but this is fiction.  People gripe at the pregnancy since it's not possible but could we remember that we're reading a series about vamps and werewolves. Authors have license to make up their own rules.  How can you swoon over Edward, a vampire, and then quibble over a vamp-human pregnancy?  Not sure I get that logic.  I felt like the book was just twists and turns of surprises.  Happiness at the wedding and then shock at the pregnancy.  Then the switch to Jacob's perspective was wonderful.  I've always loved Jacob as a character and Bella's best friend so I was very pleased to hear his thoughts and see the scenes from his eyes.  Stephenie did a great job of voicing both characters.  I didn't see Jacob imprinting on the baby coming at all so that was a huge shock but it works for me.  Bella's transformation to a vampire may have gone a little too smoothly but I can accept that she's a unique person and her strength of will is strong enough to dominate everything else.  And I found it wonderful that she's come full circle to the point that she's now the one protecting and saving the people she loves rather than always being the one being saved (usually from herself).  She finds the place where she fits and finds herself.  It was lovely to see.  Sure, I hate the baby's name but I'm really pleased with everything else.  I feared fights, battles and beloved characters lost and luckily we were given a happy ending where strength of character, truth, and above all LOVE triumph.  I can't have any complaints with that.
031606792X|4.0|~~~Well, for one thing Stephanie Meyer has a fantastic mind inside of that head of hers...full of amazing imagination and feeling. I'd love to see what goes on inside the created world inside her head just once. And here she has created the everlasting ending to one big monumental story, it finally has its ending completed. Marvelous, is THE word to be used in her case to describe her work here, just marvelous.[[First i will speak without spoliers and then note when i am going to spoil =)]] This small part of the whole story that Stephanie has created has many twists, turns, bites and gifts to the mind of the reader...it is very fulfilling in many ways. The story picks off where the last does, Eclipse...what with jacob leaving away from La Push and Forks to Canada, and Bella and Edward engaged to be wed. But inside this book Bella and everyone around her suffers from a decision that was unknown that occured by no forseen knowledge, and every consequence that tumbles down after it. In this suspencful novel, it takes you through danger, love, passion, miracles, astonishment, greif, and the imcomprehensible wondorous adoration towards all characters and the unraveling story ...right in the palms of your hands. Bellas decisions shape all of the events and consequences in this book filling the undying thirst you quenched, wanting to reveal itself in this masterpiece. Breathlessly, you are hung diving head-long into this epic romance phenomenom, Breaking Dawn captures readers from all over the world, Bringing the wanted love and life for Edward and Bella, to an uprising gathered in each readers hopeful mind. This book definitly does not let down for any reader with an open mind. For yours and my sake I would press to not read any fanfics  before reading this book as some other's guesses might take the amazement away from this guessing book. This book is meant for you to read and believe from what your thoughts are about it, not from reviews that tell you all negative aspects, listen to your own head and this book has a light not even the sun could hold, a bright welcoming to dwelve into a story with great meaninging and love. Read Please... its well worth every breath you take to read..        [[NOT SPOILER]] \\"When you loved the one who was killing you, it left you no options. How could you run, how could you fight, when doing so would hurt that beloved one? If your life was all you had to give, how could you not give it? If it was someone you truly loved\\"            But Overall, Stephanie has brought this story to a beautiful ending, leaving you with a lot to chew on but enough to hold you over with of few questions of what might happen, but fits perfectly...i see this as not a book but just the ending fourth of this one BIG  novel, that was lost and now finished. I see them as a whole and this was that last sweet fourth of the pie. Bravo Stephanie!!!...all i can say is breathtakingly sweet, and lucious in the mind of the reader, and good enough to sink you teeth deep into =]                                    ***[[S P O I L E R]]***            Now, for people who have read then I would just like to say my one reason for my small negativity and the same reason I think makes others not appreciate this book. The one negativity would be the ending... I loved the ending, it was sweet and easy but BIG.. when the fight scene at the end was occuring, I was sooo excited for it to explode and become ito a big fight..like in Lord of the Rings the \\"final\\" fight..yeah thats what i wanted, but after I had finished it I felt it wasnt necessary and her ending worked perfect, but still it would have been an interesting twist right??..Now the one thing I loved and hated for funny reasons was how after book 1 ..all I wanted to do was continue reading about bella and edward, and I didnt really feel like reading about jacob, ugh...haha, no i love jacob!..but anyways, then after jacobs story ending all I wanted to read was his...haha...how ironic??, anyways... Stephanie has this amazing ability in her writing to stop at THE perfect moment that fulfills you but wants you hungry for even more at the end of each book inside this, it was addicting!!...but I was kinda upset about the sex scene that was to occur at their honeymoon, but she DEFINITLY made up for it towards the end when bella was a vampire, if ya know what i mean =]]...and iI'm glad she gave more character lines to like emmett, rosalie, etc...but i missed alice too much =[.    *********LOVE FOR STEPHANIE AND BREAKING DAWN, ITS PERFECTION BITTEN WITH MORE PERFECTION =]
031606792X|1.0|I've never been a fan of the Twilight Saga. Never. I think the books are horribly contrived, horribly written and horribly famous for no tangible reason whatsoever. But I read Breaking Dawn expecting it to be like Eclipse or the other two books that precede it: boring and unoriginal.    However, Breaking Dawn is anything but. And not in good ways.    ***This review DOES contain spoilers.***    I've seen on various interviews with Stephanie Meyer where'd say something like...  \\"Twilight is about finding love, New Moon is about losing love and Eclipse is about choosing love.\\"  Choice. That was a theme SMeyer constantly bombarded us with in Eclipse and how Bella had to give up a lot to be with Edward.    In Breaking Dawn, every single one of these so-called \\"sacrifices\\" were negated.    Bella wanted to become a vampire so she can be with Edward forever and ever and she says in Eclipse that her body isn't going to be the same once she's turned. Basically, she gives up sex. However, we find that magically (perhaps through divine intervention?) she can still WANT Edward the same way after she's a vampire.    Bella gave up a \\"normal\\" future aka having kids. Through some logic-defying twist, she gets pregnant and delivers a beautiful baby girl. This doesn't make sense. SMeyer has said before in interviews that vampires have no sperm. How can Edward get Bella pregnant if he has no sperm? SMeyer breaks the rules to her own land to derive this terrifically amateurish plot twist.    Bella gave up her family. In reality, Charlie finds out the Cullens are \\"different\\" and--through some convenient plot development--doesn't want to know more. (If he DOES find out about vampires, of course, the Volturi would either want him turned or dead.)  Of course, Renee continues to be the absentee parent and it seems that Meyer completely seems to have forgotten about her.    I know SMeyer wanted a fairy tale ending. What I don't know is WHY. The previous three books--while still bad--were dark(in a very boring way but this review isn't about them) with almost a brooding tone. A fairy tale ending isn't realistic or suitable.    I'm not even going to get into the bad grammar/writing or major character flaws. I could write pages and pages on what's wrong with the Twilight Saga but what I've written here will suffice.    P.S. NESSIE/RENESMEE CARLIE. Really? And I thought JKR was bad with the naming.
0061537934|5.0|If you are one who's fortunate enough to have had the wonderful experience of loving a dog, this book is for you. Further more, if you believe that dogs have souls, then it's a `must read.' I laughed, I got `choked up' at the end but when I put the book down I realized that this was one of best reading experiences I've had in years. I've given the book to three friends who share my feelings about dogs (and maybe, racing cars). Garth Stein is an amazing author and I'm going explore some of his other works. Enzo lives and dogs rule!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This was my first introduction to this story, never having read the book or scene other productions. I absolutely loved it. I was heart-broken with Elizabeth when she realized she had lost a man she truly was able to love, and relieved and overjoyed with her when it turned out that his love endured even after her initial rejection. I totally believed that they had fallen in love with each other and would be happily married after the film's end. And I wanted that happiness for them both so very badly. That to me is as much success as a romance story can ever hope to achieve, so 5 stars.
031606792X|3.0|Wow, tough crowd!  While there were some disappointments for me in this book, it is overall a good read and an appropriate end to the series.  I think Meyer attempted to make too many of us happy in the end and that was the downfall, but that doesn't make the whole thing bad.  I'll reread this one, not with the enthusiasm of the first three, but with an enduring love for the characters that Meyer was gracious enough to share with me.
031606792X|5.0|I admit I was surprised by the book, but I loved it. I think Stephanie is trying to show that in the end real love can conquer anything.
031606792X|4.0|This is a good book. The plot surprised me but I think the only thing it's really lacking is the emotions that got us to love the series. There is no Bella and Edward together after book one. I was expecting to read about love and family and I got a rollercoaster of events. I still love the series and respect the author. It's not her best work though.
031606792X|2.0|First i would like to say (like everyone else) Im in love with the twilight series!  I went to the midnight release party for BD and finished it within 24 hours.  This book was nothing like i expected.  As much as i did NOT like the fact that bella had a baby and got to keep everything perfect in her life...edward, becoming a vamp., jake as a best friend, and charlie (there was no great sacrafic that i had been preparing myself for)...i was SO much more upset that it just didnt feel like i was reading Edward and Bellas story.  The character connection was completely absent for me.  The ending was anti-climatic.  SM builds us up for this huge fight where the cullens and all the friends must stand against the corupt Volturi, they train, and practice, for what seems like half of the book.  Then in the scene where it should all go down, we get nothing!  I missed the connection between Edward and Bella, it felt like someone besides SM was writing BD.  I missed Alice.  I wish there was more description about the honeymoon night and maybe the first time they had sex as vamp. and less of the needles, time after time, fade to black sex implication.  I think if readers are old enough to handle a half vampire half human baby violently ripping itself out of its mother while the father tears open the uterus, they should be able to handle a scene of the physical act of true love that we all knew Edward and Bella had.      It makes me even more sad that there are ppl that loved this book.  I wish, so hard, that i loved this book.  I want to love it, and honestly regaurdless of what happened in the story i probably would have, if i felt the connection to all the characters like i had in the first 3.    I still recommend that anyone interested in the series read this book only because this is how the author intened it to end.  Just be warned, you will NOT be dazzeled by this one like you have been by the others.    This is so depressing....
1572814349|5.0|There are already a number of reviews here that describe this deck very well, so I will simply say that this is an exceptionally beautiful deck. In fact, the box itself is a work of art! At $25, this is also an exceptional deal.
031606792X|1.0|to start off... I LOVE/ADORE/OBSESS OVER Twilight and SM.       But reading Breaking Dawn broke my heart. It seemed like the characters completely changed........ even if the plotlines stayed the same the characters would have needed to still be \\"Alice\\" \\"Edward\\" ect. for me to like the book. I honestly would have liked it, if i was able to recognize the characters. Or the world.     It seemed like SM just molded the world so it would fit perfectly to her ending, which is fine as it is her ending, but it was a big let down.    But if ... she can't write a sex scene (after marriage, even), how did she manage to write about Bella vomiting blood, while the blood pooled inside of her stomach before edward ripped open the placenta with his teeth.       That scene scarred me forever... and I'm an Anita Blake fan.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|If you love supernatural then you will enjoy watching season one,two and three number three is coming out in September.I can not wait to buy it!!! Highly recommend for everyone who loves supernatural to get it. =]
B00005JPY0|2.0|Overall, I found this film to be disappointing.  This is a shame.  The initial public response seemed to be very positive and the trailers that I saw of Heath Ledger as the Joker looked tremendous.  It's a pity that it didn't live up to expectations.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight\\" is very different from other Batman films.  It is certainly darker and even more violent that its predecessors.  This is a plus.  In fact, Heath Ledger's Joker is far removed from the high camp earlier versions of Jack Nicholson and Caesar Romero.  This time the character has some depth and fear.  The Joker is a psychopath rather than a pure comic strip side show.<br /><br />As to the rest of the film, \\"The Dark Knight\\" is grossly over-rated.  Yes, I know that we need to take the plot with a grain of salt.  But, really, the plot ventures into the absurd.  I'm sure it appeals to a teenage audience.  However, as an adult, I found my credulity being strained to snapping point.  To be frank, I was glad when the film ended and the lights in the cinema came on.<br /><br />So, if you're a Batman aficionado, you'll probably find this film in the top of its class.  If you're a more disinterested viewer, I suspect you may be less than impressed.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|This DVD series of Supernatural was great!! Even though I haven't been able to watch it yet I've been waiting for the right time to be able to watch them all in one sitting or maybe two.Recommend other people to buy it if they like this show.I LOVE THIS SHOW!! :)
0670020745|3.0|The author describes minutely her subjective experience of having a stroke and her struggle to recover.  It's a quick primer on brain functioning, particularly on the activites of the  right and left hemispheres.  One feels great empathy and admiration.      However, the book could easily have been a magazine article, as it is quite repetitious. First, it becomes a catalogue of thank-yous to her mother, who aided her recovery.  Second, it is an under-edited exhortation to train our minds to choose right-hemisphere thinking, which is more loving and accepting and less judgmental. Oops. Maybe I still need practice on that.
031606792X|5.0|I liked this book. None of the others following Twilight have been as good, but this was probably as good as Eclipse and better than New Moon. It was funny in parts, and captivating in others. Some parts of it were a little lengthy and drawn out. Jacob had more time than Edward, and Edward was left in the shadows too much. But the book in itself was pretty good. I was just left longing for a little more of Edwards personality and Edwards and Bella's relationship. Edward was often wrote off as \\"planning with Carlisle\\" in the background.The book by itself was entertaining, people should see it as it is, simply entertainment.
B000002A3T|3.0|But after that, not much else to say. The second album under the Pink Floyd name without Roger Waters seriously misses his presence, especially in the lyrics division. The album is, conceptually, about relationships splitting apart (\\"Division Bell,\\" get it?), and minus the subtext of Gilmour's acrimony towards Waters, you'd think this was a divorce album.<br /><br />The bluesy \\"What Do You Want From Me\\" is the hardest song here. With a biting lyric and Gilmour's standard fluid guitar leads, it is probably the most obvious FU to the former band member. However, the concept strains itself and becomes too obvious by the time you hit songs like \\"Wearing The Inside Out\\" or \\"Lost for Words.\\" If it weren't for Hawkings' voice on \\"Keep Talking,\\" it would be a wholly forgettable song.<br /><br />The best of the rest are \\"A Great Day For Freedom\\" and \\"High Hopes.\\" \\"Great Day\\" finds our unhappy protagonist marveling at the fall of The Berlin Wall, yet forlornly wondering why inner peace is so far from his grasp. \\"High Hopes\\" looks back to the days of \\"magnets and miracles,' and then stares in the face of dashed hopes and disillusionment. The rest of \\"The Division Bell,\\" however, doesn't measure up to previous full-band classics like [[ASIN:B000024D4S Wish You Were Here]] or [[ASIN:B000006TRV The Wall]]. Completists may need this, but others can proceed with caution.
031606792X|4.0|Now that it is a day later and I had time to reflect back on this book, it was pretty good. I cried a lot and giggled here and there and also went, huh!!!  I think if I re-read it, I will appreciate it more, it was alot to take in. I wish the wedding scene was longer. I enjoyed the honeymoon scene, I only wish she did some college before getting pregnant.   I thought Jacobs book was differnet, really couldn't get into him....  I didn't feel that connected to the characters in this book, but maybe cause i had such expectations and i wanted to see what happened in the end, which was good. who doesn't love a happy ending.   i didn't like the Volutri and the other vampires from the differnet covens, i wished it just stayed in the family, but now that it is over, i can relax and next time when i read it, will probably enjoy it more.
031606792X|5.0|One of the best series beginnings, now has the perfect ending. Twilight was a breathtaking love story; a fairy tale. Breaking Dawn is the proper happily-ever-after.     Stephenie Meyer has written a very brave tale, with a concept that wasn't going to be recieved by her fans with universal joy. But she told it. Beautifully. Bella turned from a slightly confused and whiny main character, into one of the most courageous, and now one of my favorite characters in anything I've ever read. The story was exciting, it made me cry and laugh, and was sometimes so scary I was shaking.     My favorite scene had to be when Edward heard Nessie's thoughts, and said that she loved Bella, and loved hearing his voice too. That was beautiful. I really can't believe some people would hate Bella for keeping Nessie alive, after that.    I loved this book, and I sincerly hope that others will love it as much as I do.    Katie
0761944524|5.0|This book was an enormous help to me in writing my doctoral dissertation. Now, I am a Communications scholar and I did a content analysis, so I didn't need to master a lot of highly advanced techniques. But nor had I taken courses that taught statistics in any depth. I was feeling quite at sea on some things. And for a dissertation, you really have to understand things, so you can defend it at the end. Although I had other statistics books and they certainly were helpful, this one that walked me through the tests I had been doing and -- quite simply, with patience and good humor -- helped me to understand why they were necessary and basically how they worked. I liked the fact I could read much or as little detail as I could absorb at the time -- there are quick summaries, clearly marked, or longer, quite simple explanations for those in a hurry, as well as in-depth explanations for things you really need to know thoroughly. It was having those choices that made this book incredibly helpful.
B0011N1WE8|4.0|PENELOPE<br /><br />What a sweet little movie!  Penelope is born under a curse put on her father's family by a witch.  The first-born girl in the family will be cursed  with the snout of a pig instead of a nose!  Ta-Da!  We have Penelope!  The curse can only be broken when she finds someone who will love her truly.<br /><br />Penelope's mom tries so hard to find her a man who will get rid of that big old piggy nose.  The search is on, and most of the eligible young men are scared to death of Penelope.  Enter Max who does not run, who truly does care.  He sees Penelope for WHO she is, not WHAT she looks like.<br /><br />So, off we go on a merry-go-round of fun; Penelope runs away, sees the world for the first time, chaos and fantasy ensue!<br /><br />The movie is good fun and very suitable for young and old alike.  The acting is great -- Christina Ricci as Penelope, James McAvoy as Max, and Catherine O'Hara as Penelope's mom.  O'Hara is a riot, so much like her character in HOME ALONE.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie and highly recommend this to everyone.  I believe the moral to this fairy tale would be be true to yourself and love yourself.  Also, another moral would be not to judge a book by its cover, it's what on the inside that counts, oh, please, help me!  There are many morals to this cute little movie! But that's not the point!  The point is to just ENJOY.<br /><br />Thanks!<br />Pam
031606792X|4.0|There may be spoilers but it's necessary to give justfication to my review.    I cannot decide whether to give this a three star or a four star.  But I am sure that this is NOT a one-star book.    Each one who will read this book will have a different experience with it.  I do suggest you read it for yourself before you decide to believe those who says this is crappy.    It is NOT bad.  It could have done better with more fight scenes towards the end.  The anticipation of the coming danger has more chapters than the actual danger itself or the resolution of the whole problem.      Okay so SM is a fan of happily-ever-afters.  Is that bad?  I don't think so.  This could well be a fairy tale instead of an epic.  Ordinary girl gets a hot boyfriend and he loves her more than anything in the world.  He isn't human.  He turns her into his kind, but not before knocking her up and giving her the best human experience any woman deserved.  I love Edward and Bella so much when I read Twilight.  And I think they deserved that much.  They deserve eternity and I love them enough to want them to have a baby.      I read Breaking Dawn with the same mindset I had when I was reading New Moon and Eclipse.  I read as if I was reading an extended version of Twilight.  I wanted to take a peek at what Edward's and Bella's life were going to be after Twilight.  The conflicts, the pains and the final happily-ever-after.    If there had not been any sequel to Twilight, Jacob may not be as important as he is now.  This saga is ABOUT Edward's and Bella's lovestory.  Twilight IS a lovestory, more than it is a vampire story.  So we already know they will end up together.  Because if they don't, then what was the whole point?  What's the point of me falling in love with the lovestory of Edward Cullen and Bella Swan if she ended up being Bella Black in the end?  I would not even watch the movie if that had been the case!    This book may not have been as exciting as we wanted it to be.  Eclipsehad been more mysterious and more exciting, I think.  But that book irritated me because Bella's character irritated me there.  She was fickle, obsessive, selfish and whiny.  You will be happy to know that she is not like that anymore in Breaking Dawn.  Not even so much when she was still human during the earlier part of the book.    Why are people complaining about Bella all of a sudden protective of her baby?  Well guys, if you get married, things change!  Your perspective in life changes!  It seems that Bella matured more in days than in the years--in the previous books.  She's making up for it, guys!  She was too immature in Eclipse.  If she neglected her baby, we would have hated her more!  So I think this is better.      Edward...  Well, he is being Edward.  Always torn between saving Bella's life, and giving her everything she asks for.  The perfect, flawless Romeo.  That's what made us fall in love with him.  He suffered in this book... for Bella's pain and suffering.  He was willing to sacrifice everything... his love, his happiness, for Bella.  He's done this before in the other books and he will do it again here.  But here, we get to see how he would connect with Bella as a vampire too.  No more holding back too much.  No more holding hER as if She was breakable.  And in this book, Edward gets to be a husband... and a father.  It is also in this book that he gets to bond more with the wolves.    The bond between the vamps and wolves is more displayed here.  Co-existence.  For the same cause.  Fighting again on the same side.  Accepting each other's differences.  Enduring each other's scents.  Here, Jacob and Seth comes and goes the Cullen mansion as if they live there themselves.  I totally enjoyed this part.    Jacob... well, he's still Jacob.  Funny.  Rash.  Reckless.  Normal teenage boy.  The second part of the book was written in his perspective.  Of course.  Can Bella describe EXACTLY how the imprinting went?  At first, I wasn't happy when I startedreading the Jacob part.  But after this part, I must admit that this is the funniest part of the book.  I laughed more in Jacob's part than in any other parts of the book.  And I did like Jacob better in this book.  He wasn't too stubborn to fight and get in between Edward and Bella.  He loved Bella more than that.  He understood self-sacrifice.  And in the end, when the baby was born, he understood everything.  He finally understood the concept of imprinting.  And he understood why Bella was not meant for him from the beginning.  He would only hurt her.  And she would hurt Edward had she chosen Jacob.    Rose gets her piece too.  And she's made her peace with Bella.  It was fun to see them working together and Rosalie and Jacob getting on each other's nerves.    This book is about every character you have met in the previous books and then some new additions.  Not just Bella and Edward.  Like I said, a peek of their lives after Twilight.  And since they are surrounded by relationships and so much love, other their own, this book has been a lot about the other characters too.      Reneesme... Okay so I'm also not a fan of the name.  But I've heard creepier names.  (I had once seriously considered naming my future son Count Drake!  It's my baby!)  Reneesme is Stephanie Meyer's brainchild.  She can name her anything she wants.  I loved how she has Bella's eyes, and so much of Edward in her.    And don't get the wrong idea from the bad reviews that Jacob on Reneesme is phedophilia.  I think they stopped reading there!  Otherwise, they would have seen that Jacob has become her ultimate protector.  He doesn't even see Reneesme in an improper way!  And Edward confirmed that in the end.  He will wait for her.  Not for long.  Six or seven years, she will be a full-grown adult.  It would be nice to see that one.  A wolf and a halfling.  But in BD, there is nothing there but the ultimate sense to protect her.  Babysit her.  Give her everything she wants.  And he doesn't evensee the potential in the relationship even after it was revealed that she will be an adult in six or seven years.  Edward said that much and he was in Jacob's head.    Maybe some people expected a more grander drama, someone dying because it is only much more realistic that they do.  But then again, this is a fantasy.  None of these are supposed to be real.  So who are we to judge what is realistic and what is not?  So nobody died.  It was a happy ending.  Not realistic?  You're reading a vampire love story for crying out loud!    If you loved Edward Cullen and Bella Swan that much, then I think you will be satisfied at the way Breaking Dawn turned out.  For both of them.  Everybody worked out just fine.  They have been under so much strain, they deserve the happy ending.  And they deserve Reneesme.  A product of their timeless love.  Jacob deserved Reneesme too.  A gift for all his sacrifices.    I would have wanted a longer fight scene towards the end and probably a bit more twist, more challenge.  Maybe Aro refusing to leave until he acquires Edward and Bella.  Thus, I can't give this five stars.    But since Bella emerged as great vampire here, making up for all her fragility and uselessness in the past books, I would give this a four stars.  Yes, folks, Bella was super in her vampiric life.  Bella was able to render the most powerful members of the Vulturri helpless.  for once, she was the heroine!  For once, she felt she deserved Edward!
031606792X|1.0|The development from the past three books gave Meyer the opportunity to write a entertaining finale, but instead she wrote a fan fic crap novel. Sad to say, I've read fan fiction that was ten times more intriguing and well developed than Breaking Dawn. The main characters, especially Edward are lacking identity because Meyer clogged the book with pointless plot lines and unnecessary new character (NESSIE). And the fact that there is no action or climatic fight scenes is even more depressing.<br /><br />This book is so awful and out of character in the twilight series that I am going from now on force myself to believe that Eclipse is the final book in this series.<br /><br />I'm currently looking for my receipt to return this crap of a book.
0743454537|4.0|If you need to get lost in a page turner- this is it! A bit unrealistic in coincidence at the end- but I couldn't put this book down for two days.  Twist and turns and I had tears running down my face. I am looking forward to reading Nineteen Minutes, my second novel by this author.  I confess I read ahead- but it was wonderful even knowing the ending (though, I DON'T recommend spoiling the book as I did).  I still think of this book weeks later- the message I walked away with was a reminder - Live life in every moment like it matters- and everyone matters in each moment I'm in; there are always distractions.
031606792X|5.0|I thought Meyer did great in this book!! She ended it perfectly. I was hoping for a happy ending for everyone and that is what she gave us. She tied up every end. She ended Bella and Rosalie's wedge, and brought them together as a family. She also gave Jacob a way to find love and be happy after everything he had went through with Bella. She made it possible for Bella to continue to be with Charlie, after not living with him until later in life. She also gave her the one thing she would truly miss out on by being a vampire, being a mother. As far as her \\"gift\\", I honestly would have expected something just like that. As much as she worried about everyone being in danger and trying to protect them, this gift fits her perfectly. I also was very pleased about Bella after her change. The other books let us know that turning into a vampire was not normally a choice, since not many humans know about them, so I was not very surprised when she was able to keep herself in check. Expecially after the the way others with powers were not able to afect her mentally, we should have expected her mind to be different.     This book is the perfect love-fantasy story, in my opinion. It fits in with all the old classic ones. Sometimes the princess gets the prince and lives happily ever after. I personally thank Stephenie Meyer for giving us another perfect love story with a happy ending.
031606792X|3.0|(Spoiler alert is in effect!) Other reviewers have already captured the dissatisfaction produced by a novel that allows a heroine to have her cake and eat it, too.  Bella even overcomes the prohibition on letting her father know she is a vampire, in a quite implausible way.  One certainly would have thought the Volturi would see through that little charade.  One of the things that bothered me the most, however, was the excessive focus on appearances.  Bella becomes supernaturally beautiful, as she must, I suppose, to equal Edward.  The book thus turns becoming a vampire into the ultimate beauty makeover.  And don't even get me started on the ideology of motherhood expressed in the book.  I am an adult who enjoyed the first three books, despite the overwrought and unrealistic descriptions of Bella's beloved.  In the first three books, I could say to myself that the author was portraying Edward as Bella saw him, not as the reader was supposed to see him. But this book became a mere Harlequin romance portraying a relationship so perfect as to be completely incredible.  Yes, this is a fantasy, but still!  That said, the author can still write a page-turner.  I admit to having stayed up way past my bedtime reading the book.
031606792X|3.0|Well, like everyone else I was waiting impatiently to read this book. I have to admit I heard some of the spoilers and thought to myself how ridiculous they sounded. Guess what?? They were true. Even down to the whole Nessie name for the child of Bella and Edward.     Parts of the book were really good. The first book I enjoyed. We got to   read about their wedding and honeymoon. I got angry and cheered along with Jacob in the second book just like I did in New Moon and Eclipse.     Then we get to read about Bella being pregnant and how she won't give up the baby even though it is killing her. A lot of reviewers are talking about choice and I guess you can say that keeping the baby was her choice even though she knew what it was doing to her physically. Why she would not listen to reason is beyond me? Why even bring in the pregnancy plot line is beyond me? Who knew vampires could procreate? I was really wishing that spoilers were untrue about this plot line.     The fact that Jacob imprinted on Reneseme (I would have wished her first name was Carlie and Renesme was her middle name) was creepy. I thought that Quill imprinting on a kid was creepy as well.     I expected that the Volturi were going to play a part in this book since they wanted to make sure that Bella was indeed a vampire. When they did show up, I really enjoyed reading that part as well.     Sidenote: When Renesme talks to Aro about talking to her humans I was waiting for him or Cauis to charge the Cullen family with giving their secret away.     The series did end with Bella having everything she wanted. I have to admit, I kind of like it that way. I am a bit of a sap. She did not have to sacrifice her relationship with Charlie does not seem to be fitting though. The fact that Charlie did not want to know everything that was going on with his daughter was not right. It is his daughter that we are talking about. He never really did like Edward. Why would he not want to know what is really going on.Overall, I enjoyed the book. However, some of the plot twists were just not what I expected or wished for and really did not seem to fit with the other books.     Twilight is still my favorite book of the series. I recommend that you at least read that book.
031606792X|1.0|Wow. I had no idea that the talent that could produce Twilight was capable of somthing this....amateur. Breaking Dawn is a huge disappointment to anyone who appreciated Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse. And even more so, that her editors were so afraid of Stephenie that they didn't do a thing to stop this, well, fan fiction from being perpetrated on her fans.    Fan fiction it is. Anyone could have written Breaking Dawn. The plot - which I hate to call it a plot - is so simple. Quite frankly, Breaking Dawn feels tacked on to the story arc that was completed in Eclipse. Bella and Edward get married and live happily ever after. Oh, there's a slight bit of difficulty with the werewolves, and Bella's transformation is truly gruesome, and then the Volturi step in - only to be dispatched by a truly deus ex machina character. The promise of the Twilight Saga fizzles out to a wimper.    There's so much more ickiness than I've let on, but I don't want to reveal too much for those still willing to read it. I know there are fans out there who are happy with this book, but - and this will be very stereotypical - they're hardly mature enough to understand how bad this book is because they're all 12 and younger.    Save yourself the ick-factor and the disappointment. Pretend Eclipse is the end of the Twilight Saga.
B0015XASFS|5.0|This DVD was so good. He is growing as an artist and a performer. The DVD quality was also great. He is my favorite artist!
B0018QCXH8|4.0|The Story had its dark moments and the Acting was indeed fine. If I had to do it over again I would have prob watched it on Pay-per-view but if your a fan of the Actor its a must see.
031606792X|5.0|Maybe I shouldn't be shocked to see so many low reviews on here, but I am.   I thought the book was FABULOUS!   It had everything the first 3 did (including shock, and thinking OUTSIDE of the box) and yet.... it finally had what I was craving all along..... a feeling of contentment... happiness.... joy in the end.     I feel as though Meyers stayed true to all the characters. Sure, some parts where not at all what i would expect or want (and i won't give away anything), but it was still a WONDERFUL book!   As soon as my daughter goes down for a nap I'm going to start reading it again. =)    Thank you Stephenie Meyers for a wonderful bow on the gift!
031606792X|1.0|I consider myself a big fan of this series -- I run websites, attend fan events, and no one could deny that I was really looking forward to this book. And yet, I have never felt such a disappointment with something I am so invested in. Everything that I once adored about this series was destroyed in this book and I'm only sorry that these characters, who had so much potential, were ruined.
B0014I4KIK|5.0|Duffy's a superb singer because she sings from the heart. I bought the CD to share with students in my college writing classes, and they all were deeply touched, especially by the song, \\"Warwick Avenue.\\"
B0000X61UU|4.0|I have to admit that I remember her first workout video targeting my problem area (the thighs!) a little better. But this video will definitely give you results. You will be sore and more tone after one use, and that's even if you skip a few of the ab sections :)  Enjoy your workout!
0060899190|5.0|PostSecret allows everyone the ability to put their innermost thoughts and feelings that they may not be able to share with others into written form to share them with the world. The secrets are a mixture of happy, sad, silly, hopeful-every possible emotion much like life. If you read this book expect to feel every emotion possible!
B0017MO10U|5.0|I thought the movie was very good. It was nice to see many elements from past seasons culminating in the team \\"saving\\" earth once again. My only complaint is that the movie ended more abruptly than I would have liked. Just when I was really getting into it, it was over. Can't wait for more.
006135323X|4.0|Dan Ariely has written a very engaging look into experiments he has conducted over his tenure at MIT. He starts with his medical history of his third degree burns over his body. Ariely does this to make the reader aware of his inspiration to \\"discover what people really like\\" in the world. His first example is removing the cloth from his wounds in a fast or slow motion. The nurses are sure the fast rip with a quick flash of pain is the best way; however, this makes Ariely begin to wonder the truth behind this common assumption.<br /><br />The book flows in and out of his history and there did not seem to be in chronological order. The reader could skip around the chapters to their own delight. Ariely has made the book approachable for anyone with an affinity for experiments and the \\"why\\" behind the decisions. This approach has been made popular by \\"Freakonomics\\", \\"What Sticks\\", \\"Economic Naturalist\\", and many other books along the same line. I enjoyed Ariely's book the most of the new economist book series.<br /><br />Chapter Six, Nine, Eleven, and Twelve were my favorite chapters out of the thirteen in the book. Procrastination, Expectations, and Honesty are all prominently featured in these chapters. I did not feel I could better understand all the subjects he discussed in the other chapters any more than before for various reasons like I have read it, heard it, or not interested were the main reasons.<br /><br />I believe people should give Ariely's book a look just to see where some of his antics and experiments are different from the aforementioned books. It is approachable and a joyful read that is over before it begins. Ariely has done something to set himself apart from the economist books before him and also borrows some of their insights for his book. If anything check the book out from the library to see his experiments in action and know why human beings are predictably irrational.
B000UO4F8E|5.0|Yet another chilling installment in the Saw franchise.  Each new film lets us into mind of Jigsaw just a little bit more.  Good fun.
031606792X|5.0|Ok, first of all, i need to say that the people who said it ended too happy, didn't harry potter end happy or lord of the rings or many of the other great books?! i mean really...    I loved the book! Firstly because Bella matures in this book and she's not as dumb in it and she shows her true strength in this book! I know there was alot of graphic things in this book but then again, it's a vampire book so what do you expect? Also it was not all flowers and sunshine in the book there were some really deep parts that made me cry!    Overall it was a very good book and i'm definately going to read it over and over again because it's way happy and a mood booster!
1594489505|5.0|I truly didn't think I could love another book as much as I did \\"The Kite Runner.\\" However, this one is as good! Just as his earlier book concentrated on relationships among men, this one focuses on relationships among women - and what relationships they are! This is a simply wonderful book - I can't wait for his next one!
B00005V9IJ|5.0|This film is just about perfect, another successful Hanks/Zemeckis/Silvestri collaboration.  Tom Hanks demonstrates again his renowned commitment and style.  Robert Zemeckis is on top of his game here and deserves as much credit for what isn't in the film as for what is.  And the music...oh God, the music.  It's notable for not existing till almost the end, but by then you're ready for it.  It says it all, carries it right over the top, speaks to a place inside beyond the movie.  You will know what it means to be 'cast away', if you dare.  Fortunately, Zemeckis is not Tchaikovsky.  See this movie and you'll know what I mean.
0679805273|5.0|This makes a great book.  I gave one to a friend who's daughter is going to  Kindergarten, I bought one for my little one and sent one to my brother who needed a little pick me up to get back on the right track.  Its very motivational and I recommend it to every one of all ages.
B000VS6R26|4.0|Really, what else needs to be said about Titanic?  This edition has some great background material that you'll enjoy including an alternate ending that will have you rolling and pounding on the floor!  I'm not sure who ultimately gets the the credit for the one that we all know but from this you can see that the editing room doesn't get near enough credit.
031606792X|4.0|I read the first three books only two weeks ago and devoured them in little under 3 days.  I anxiously awaited Breaking Dawn...and was only slightly disappointed.  Some predictable turns and things ended too neatly (could it have killed her to just let Jacob suffer?  to let Bella suffer a little knowing what her selfish actions in refusing to give him up did to Jacob's heart?)  That does not make the book bad, nor do the final choices of the characters mean that Stephanie Meyer believes all teenagers should marry young and have babies, with no higher education.  She herself is educated and is a role model IN THE REAL WORLD for teenagers and adults alike (whereas Bella is an almost fully rounded character in a fictional NOVEL).  Meyer's books reinforce the idea that, no matter the struggle or situation, a close network of family and friends can help you through it.<br /><br />It is sad though, because the best part of books 1-3 was the tension between Bella's humanity and Edward's immortality, as expressed in various ways.  Now that the final book is here, everything is wrapped up nice and tight, no more tension or suspense.  Well, at least until I start rereading Twilight. ;)
031606792X|4.0|I went to a midnight release party for this book, and all I kept hearing was how everyone couldn't wait for Bella to become a vampire and they hoped she chose Edward... \\"...If she hasn't been turned before the book is half over I'm going to freak.\\" -- \\"If she doesn't pick Edward I'll just die.\\"  Well, of course she chose Edward and did become a vampire, so how could the dynamic between the characters not change.  Bella is no longer the clumsy, accident prone girl.  She is now a young, strong vampire.    I did, however, feel that this book was trying to cram a lot into one last story.  It could easily have been broken into two separate books.  Then maybe the transition from mortal to immortal, and the change in dynamic between characters wouldn't have been such a shock to everyone.  Only Stephenie Meyer knows why she ended the story in book 4.  We can't forget that this is HER story to tell and for us to enjoy.    Don't be fickle and just take the book for what it is.  A good read!  I did shed a couple of tears at the end of the book because I was sad that I wouldn't get to share in any more of Edward and Bella's story.
031606792X|3.0|i honestly don't know what to say!!!<br />it was just ok to me. bella got it all in the end, it was kinda \\"too happy\\". jacob shouldn't have imprinted on \\"insert weird name\\". that was gross. i think there should have been somewhat of a fight scene at the end, not to bad but a little bit.<br />and one more thing....HOW THE HELL DID BELLA GET PREGNANT? W.T.F.........creepy, i didn't know vampires had sperm.
B0013USZHG|5.0|Well, we all know the review process is flawed--the one-star review is just heinous, but it will disappear. This CD is magical. I am as non-Latina as they come, but I can't play this (at work) without swaying/dancing in my seat. People stop at my office door and smile--it is that contagious. I agree with other reviewers: Dudamel is a buoyant talent, the real thing, and I for one am thrilled to be around to watch him mature and dazzle. I live in New York where I've seen him twice, but would fly to LA to see him at work again--kudos to them for hiring this extraordinary young man. Please buy this CD--so highly recommended. Absolutely brilliant.
031606792X|4.0|***SPOILERS!!!***SPOILERS!!!***SPOILERS!!!***         I have to admit that at first I was disappointed in this book.  I felt, like so many others, that everything turned out a little too conveniently for Bella.  I also felt that it was quite predictable. I put the story together well before anything was revealed. As I have allowed myself time to absorb the story more fully, however, I find myself really liking it.  I felt that the character changes that people have talked about were necessary.  Bella couldn't continue to be that same clumsy, often irritating, teenage girl that she had been and expect to survive as a vampire for long.  Also, Edward had to change and allow Bella to develop her new Vampire self instead of being so overbearing and unreasonable.      As for her ability to seem to skip over all of the newborn problems I didn't find that as hard to swallow as some did.  I think that she had prepared her mind and that she did have an extremely strong will (which was shown in the other books). I, myself, have known people with the same kind of determination and single mindedness that she shows and they are much more capable of self control and overcoming their urges than those who don't have those characteristics. I think that the message here is that with enough preparation and determination, you can accomplish anything that is important to you.     I have read some of the reviews of those that are upset about the fact that Bella was a teenager when she became pregnant.  I agree that teenage pregnancy is not something to be taken lightly, but COME ON.  These people are the same people who thought that she was emotionally mature enough to give up her humanity and become a vampire for the rest of eternity.  It seems to me that if she can handle that decision she can certainly handle a baby, especially one that will be fully grown in approximately seven years.  As for her never particularly wanting to have children, when she found out that she was pregnant herfeelings on that changed completely.  Anyone who has had a baby can attest to the bond that is created between a mother and her child while in the womb.  The measures that she took to ensure the babies safety were consistent with what most mothers would do.  Even if it meant giving up her life she wanted to protect her child.      The argument that marrying and having a child at so young an age would interfere with her ability to experience the growth and fulfillment that comes of going to college and having interests outside the home are completely irrelevant in this scenario.  I mean, really, she is immortal now; her daughter will be fully grown in about seven years and she has all of eternity to accomplish anything she wants to.  The experience of being a parent enriches her life, as well as Edward's, rather than detracting from it.  It was something that neither of them ever expected to happen and Renesmee can only be considered a blessing.  This is a fantasy set in a world of vampires and werewolves...the issues that plague our normal human teens just don't apply in the world that Stephenie Meyer has created.  Bella is a vampire who cannot sleep she will have to fill her time with something, and I'm guessing that she will be more educated and fulfilled than any doctor, lawyer, teacher, writer, or any human woman ever could be.     Now to the part where Jacob imprints on Renesmee (I do still have a gripe with that name! I think Carlie Renesmee would have been preferable if she absolutely had to combine her parents names).  I really didn't have a problem with this, mainly because when Quil imprinted on Claire I thought a lot about the whole imprinting thing.  I have come to understand that it is not the same thing as falling in love or having romantic feelings about the person you have imprinted on.  It is more of a guardian or protector position that you assume and it can lead to love because of the bonds that you create while being around each other.  The factthat people are calling Jacob a pedophile is ridiculous.  As I said before, the same rules do not apply in their world as in ours.  He is not already in love with her and his only desire is for her to be happy and safe.  If Jacob is a pedophile then Edward is one as well.  Bella was, after all, only seventeen when he fell in love with her and he was over a hundred.    The only thing I find myself still yearning for with this book is a more satisfying ending with the Volturi.  I was really looking forward to getting to see all of the vampires get to use their respective abilities fighting against the greedy and power hungry aristocracy.  I felt that the fact that they didn't have more of a conflict with the Volturi was a bit anticlimactic.  Not that I was wanting someone to die, like so many of the reviews I have read thus far, just that I didn't want the Volturi to give in so easily.  When Alice returned, I was certain that there would have been more effort in obtaining her for themselves.  This way, however, leaves an opening if the author ever wants to add to the story.    All in all, I feel more satisfied after reflecting for a day or two than I did after initially finishing the book.  Though it didn't go the way I had envisioned it going and it's not my favorite of her books, I feel that Stephenie Meyer did a good job telling the story she wanted to tell and giving the characters the ending they deserved.
031606792X|1.0|Breaking Dawn was a disappointment. The series started out so strong with the beloved bestseller, Twilight, but as the series progressed, the quality digressed. By Eclipse, her ideas were becoming poor and ill developed. I hoped it was the weak book that every series seems to have and that she would redeem herself in Breaking Dawn and conclude the series with a novel just as loved as Twilight.<br /><br />No such luck. Breaking Dawn was more disappointing than Eclipse.<br /><br />Breaking Dawn started out with a thread of hope. The first hundred pages read like the other novels and I enjoyed the wedding and the start of the honeymoon. It looked like Stephenie Meyer might be going somewhere with it.<br /><br />But then Stephenie Meyer had to go make Bella pregnant, going against all her rules. She made it very clear that vampires can't have children or impregnate (because all bodily fluid other than venom and the blood they acquire through their prey is absent. Which would make it quite difficult to have children). So she goes against he carefully thought out vampire mythology and says heck with that, I'm gonna make Bella preggers anyway!<br /><br />The change in narration also bothered me. Stephenie Meyer stated in an interview that this would be the last novel for Bella's story. Hence the word Bella. This was supposed to be her story. A change in point of view was truly unnecessary. I think Jacob's POV made the vampires feel shallow and unreal (though we did get nice insight to the pack). I think if Stephenie Meyer really wanted to have her reader accept Bella's pregnancy, she should've told it in Bella POV.<br /><br />I was beginning to accept that fact that Bella and Edward were going to have a child. But then the unthinkable occurred.  Jacob imprints. I didn't want Jacob to imprint, period (even if it was on a NORMAL girl, but the fact that he imprinted on Bella's child was just absurd.) Imprinting was the easy way out of the love triangle and I think there should have been more pain and sacrifice in the book. By choosing Edward, Bella was giving up some things, most importantly Jacob and the chance at a normal life (which included children) Stephenie Meyer decides to make everything happy and perfect and Jake and Bella's feelings for each other suddenly disappear. The whole story would've felt a bit more real, a bit more human if there had been more sacrifices to make.<br /><br />At least the rest of the novel wasn't complete happiness and fluff. (Though I was quite annoyed at Bella's perfection. Her self-control was just too good) The appearance of the Volturi was a good idea, but poorly developed. It ended too smoothly, with perfect Bella saving the day. I think there should've been a fight with some casualties (other than Irina) Again, Stephenie Meyer was trying to hard for the happy ending. A few deaths, especially from the Cullen family, would've made the story much more believable.<br /><br />The series concluded with a happy ending. (Even the last chapter was called The Happily Ever After) It was all too good to be believable.<br /><br />The only redeeming quality about the book was the fact the Stephenie Meyer can write. Even though she came up with absurd ideas, she managed to make them work because she is a good writer. The fact that I enjoy her writing style was the only thing that allowed me to finish the novel.<br /><br />All in all, Breaking Dawn was a disappointing end to a series (and an author) that I believed had much more potential.in the book.

031606792X|1.0|The most disgusting, vile, and pathetic exuse for a twilight book. To me, it's not even a part of the series. Fanfiction has better stories than this load of trash.
0385335997|5.0|This is the third book of the Diana Gabaldon Outlander and of all the years I have been reading, they are my favorite series. Ms. Gabaldone will keep you in laughter and you will shed plenty of ters and she takes you on a journey with Claire Randall and Jamie Fraser. You will experience alot of history and become a part of what you read. Excellent books and Voyager is one of my favorites
B00008977N|5.0|I first purchased this concert on Laserdisc for my Pioneer Laser Disc player (kind of tells you how old I am) and I was blown away with the spectacle.<br /><br />Gabriel is more than a performer or musician, he is a concert artist!  If you have never experienced the power of live music versus a recording studio performance, then this disc is a must.<br /><br />You can preview it on Youtube.com, simply type \\"Secret World Gabriel\\".<br /><br />My favorite performances are Come Talk To Me, Secret World, and In Your Eyes.<br /><br />Great concert, one that I really wish I could have paid money to attend.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00000DG1R|5.0|I've always been a big Duran Duran fan back in the days, but I completely forgot about their hits until I went to their Red Carpet Massacre concert a few months ago.  It was awesome!!!  I then had to have their greatest hits CD.  I absolutely love it, and it makes the car ride so much fun!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I was thrilled from beginning to end reading BREAKING DAWN, grateful to Stephenie Meyer for writing such a wonderful saga, and saddened to read the bad reviews from petulant readers.<br /><br />Ms. Meyer has created complete, rounded, fully-faceted characters, and let us go along as they each matured -- even the adults.  I was hoping for a book that brought the saga to a happy ending, because that was the point all along:  Bella and Edward had a once-in-an-existence love that could meet and defeat any and all challenges.<br /><br />For those who carp on small details, I ask this question:  When did you decide that vampires, werewolves, Volturi, mind-reading and all the other staples of THE TWILIGHT SAGA were permissible, but a baby and a happy ending was not?  Either you hand yourself up to be entertained, or don't bother reading.<br /><br />One other thought:  These are Stephenie Meyers' characters, not yours, no matter how you might identify with them.  She fleshed out her dream and shared it with the world.  To have any response other than gratitude for being taken on a wild romantic ride is sheer selfishness.  For those who would rather be right than be happy, pick at details.  For those who want to be satisfied over and over by a fine author, grab BREAKING DAWN and the first three in the TWILIGHT SAGA and have the time of your life.
B000VDDDY6|4.0|I bought this product out of extreme curiosity, after reading of Leonard Nimoy's enthusiasm for the digital reworking therein.  What I noticed was that it is not perfect, there are numerous scenes [mostly in the closing titles and stills] with visible dirt/debris and scratches which could have been removed.  There are also quality differences from scene to scene which some viewers may find distracting [me among them]- one scene is crystal-clear, while the next scene may be comparatively fuzzy, with visible film grain and multigenerational losses visible].  Another curiosity is why they had to drown-out William Shatner's opening narration [\\"Space...the final frontier...\\"] with so much reverberation.  Other than those quibbles, I found the colors to be as garishly oversaturated [with almost a day-glow flourescent quality] as I remember from watching it on its original run [circa 1966] on an old-fashioned Setchell-Carson 25\\" color console TV, but with vastly improved fine detail - the make-up was VERY apparent, also I could see ear hair/peachfuzz on some actors! Every shaft of hair was clearly visible, along with acne scars and the border of Captain Kirk's hairpiece.  The motion-animated digital insertions were seamless and greatly enabled the enhanced \\"versimilitude\\" the producers were after.  BTW, this review applied only to the standard definition side, I have not been able to watch the HD side, as I have no HD player - this said, I am amazed they were able to make the standard-def picture so sharp and finely detailed.<br />I remember watching the digitally reworked \\"Star Trek - The Motion Picture\\" and [at the time] wondering if anybody would ever do the same thing with TOS, and now they have.  This edition is a clear improvement over the previous remasterings.  Bravo!
B00003CX8N|5.0|We begin with a true story that's compelling exactly as it is, let the screenplay tell it in the best way possible, and bring in some top-notch acting talent to bring it to life.  This is the result, a film that you will love, remember long after it's over, and be thrilled that you own on DVD so you can watch it again and again.  And you will.  Get it!
031606792X|5.0|I couldn't wait for the release of this book and I wasn't dissapointed!!  What a great end to a great series!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005YU1O|5.0|This movie is very well done.  The animation is great, I especially liked the way it matched the characters personality.  It's cool to see so many different opinions and thoughts on life and existence.  Awesome movie!
031606792X|4.0|This book is going to be a mixed bag, depending on what \\"fan base\\" you fall into when reading the Twilight series. I am a 25 year old mom, I started reading the Twilight series only after reading Meyer's adult fiction, The Host. I am not the target audience, which consists mainly of teenage \\"fan\\" girls. I could have cared less whether Jacob or Edward won the girl. I read the series out of curiosity and could not help but become addicted to Meyer's storytelling style and intriguing insight into the human (and mythical) mind. Meyer's narrative is creative and (mostly) original.<br /><br />With this said, I could not help but enjoy and be increasingly entertained as I read Breaking Dawn. It may be different than the other books, in the sense that as you continue through the story the plot becomes more \\"fantasy\\" than \\"real\\" (as the other books had felt). But what did you expect would happen to Bella's life once she made her choice between two mythical creatures? Strange things were BOUND to happen.<br /><br />Meyer continued in this book everything that she had begun with the first three. She summed the story up in a fantastical way that is sure to entertain. I will continue to be a fan of the author and plan to buy her new books as they are released.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Those reviewers who criticize the imperfect portrayal of the characters, fancying themselves to be pro Jane Austen, need to go back and read the book again to get it right. They missed a lot of things which the movie picks up beautifully. yes, there isn't time for complete character development in a 2 hour movie. yes, some scenes are combined, which wonderfully serves the purpose of retaining the emotion and atmosphere one gets from reading the book. keeping the scenes strictly by the book, and then cutting it down to 2 hours, would give a watered down version of the overall tone. these people who call themselves fans of Jane Austen seem more to be the narrow minded prejudiced snobs that she abhors. The costumes are different styles, because certain people would be able to have the lastest fashions, and others not. There is a lot of reality in this film that many  peple are overlooking, and much of the original dialogue is incorporated. And who cares that Georgiana is a little extroverted?  The BBC version, BTW, didn't stick strictly with the book - they added things that weren't in the book, like the \\"most beloved\\" lake scene.  (What would Jane think about that?)  I think Jane would appreciate all these versions as compliments to the book's timeless popularity and introducing it to new generations. It's interesting that some parts of the film, while not necessarily in the Austen book, are very similar to scenes from P. Aidan's trilogy about the whole story from Darcy's viewpoint. Interesting read to go along with a great movie!
B0014VPFTA|5.0|I love the CD. It came to my house in great condition and does not skip.
031606792X|5.0|I'm a little surprised at the negative reactions to this book.  That major issue seems to lie with Jacob imprinting Renesmee, citing it as sexual or perhaps even incestuous...     Imprinting on a child was, as anyone knows, a subject previously touched upon in the issue of (I think) Quil and Claire.  The imprinting is certainly not voluntary.  What sane grown man would ever wish to be tied toa child in any way that could be misconstrued as sexual? Despite what some would believe, I truly believe that imprinting is a testament to love in its purest form.  Jacob and Quil were not seeking physical or even romantic gratification from the subjects of their imprinting at any point in the near future.  Rather, they were willing to sacrifice relationships that could fulfill them in those ways to fully protect and be with their \\"mates\\" (for lack of a better word).  Perhaps they were aware that it would someday be a possibility.  Imprinting happens for a reason. Is it repulsive to see a 60 year old man with a 40 something woman, not even taking into account that the wolves (shape-shifters...sorry) do not age in the same way?  If not, would such a scenario still be acceptable if that same sixty year old man knew 40 or 50 years sooner who his future mate would be, but as she was much younger, simply had to wait for her?  It's not that Jacob saw Renesmee and was physically attracted to her or simply wanted her to belong to him.  He KNEW that she was his intended, the perfect mate for him, despite what he might have liked.  Let's face it, he initially would have hoped to have imprinted on Bella.  Perhaps Bellas was simply a picture of his future mate and that was partially why he was so fond of her and why he felt so compelled to stick around.    Finally, something I was absolutely incredulous about was someone claiming that Jacob's imprinting on Renesmee was \\"unrealistic\\".  I, for one, can find a a lot more in the book to call \\"unrealistic\\".  How about the freakin vampires?  It's a fantasy novel, buddy.  It's not supposed to be realistic.  What it did offer, though was a very practical resolution to the Bella and Jacob issue, one that I feel was perfect and as realistic as possible.  They were meant to be in each other's lives in some significant way.  Neither of them were ever able to make sense of their odd connection.  Perhaps, as previously stated, it was not  simply a way to keep them together so that everyone could live happily ever after.  Perhaps Jacob and Bella were so close and so insistent upon being in the other's life because of some greater good, i.e. the birth and imprinting of Renesmee.
031606792X|5.0|I've written my thoughts several times over in the discussion forum but I am deeply satisfied with this ending.
031606792X|2.0|Okay... So I loved the first three books in the Twilight Saga, but breaking dawn? No!!  *Spoilers*  A BABY?! What? Bella doesn't WANT a kid. And then she turns around and decides that she loves it and HAS to keep it. And Edward DOESN'T want to keep it or even feel any kind of feeling towards it. WHAT?! That's not Bella or Edward -ish.     The entire time I read this I felt like I was reading fanfiction. I kept thinking, \\"Nope. The real Bella would freak out. The real Edward would feel remorse for killing their child.\\"     And then part two came on and it was from JACOB'S point of view. I was pissed. I liked the charaterization of Edward but then you didn't get to see what Bella thought or what they said in private. And I honestly hated Bella in this part. She was so selfish!!! She had to on the couch where no one could hang around without being around her. And even though she chose Edward and knows that it hurts him, she still gets all happy when he walks in. I did like the Jacob-Leah relationship. It was more realistic. And I liked the scene where the baby is born. It was high anxiety and actually sucked me in. And... I hate to say this... But after Bella died... I kind of.... Wanted her to STAY DEAD. Because then Jacob imprinted ON THE BABY. Which didn't weird me out because it was a baby but because it was BELLA'S baby. The woman he is supposed to love!!!!!! And at that present moment he thought Bella was dead! Not okay.     And p.s. I hate Rosalie. She's a two-faced whore. Bleh.    And then Bella was changed. I liked that part too. I liked her point of view of the changing and her waking up. But... she was too perfect. She woke up and wasn't really all that thirsty. Which I sort of expected, she didn't like blood as a human and she was prepared when she was changed. But I kind of wanted her blood thirsty and wild and forced to live in Alaska with only Edward.     OH MY GOD. I KNOW WHAT REALLY MADE ME MAD. This book didn't follow the others in that Edward didn'tprotect Bella. She woke up and didn't need him to keep her from killing humans. He didn't have to protect her from him. He didn't have to really even protect her from the Volturi because a bunch of other people were there to help. He never looked or acted like he was freaking out over her after she turned into a vampire. He just... let it go. That was it. That's what was so un-Edward.    It was like Edward freaked out (the \\"burning man\\") when Bella was pregnant but then when he was changing her he was just determined and then she was changed and he just loved her. As in he didn't fear for her.    Back to the story. So Bella isn't really thirsty and she only really freaks out once at anyone (Jacob) and it isn't really all that big of a deal. And then perfectly-perfect, Bella and Edward get the most perfect little house of their own where they can live perfectly together and they love each other perfectly and their family is perfect. And then Charlie goes along with Bella's new life perfectly. And their slight worry is the kid and how fast she's growing (which ends up not being a problem) and Bella visiting the Volturi, who can't pick her mind to find out about the baby. No worries.     I don't even want to talk about the rest of the book except to say that the ending was predictable. Of course Alice and Jasper would come back. Of course the ending would be perfect with no one dying and Bella's gift being the thing that saves the day. Of course. Like we couldn't predict that.    I think that Stephenie Meyer was projecting her love of being a mother onto her writing. And I don't like it because this is Bella's story, not Stephenie Meyer's autobiography.
031606792X|4.0|Before I even read the book, I got on Amazon and read all the reviews to see how the plot went. I was surprised to see all these negative reactions to the book, and frankly when I started actually reading, I had those in mind. However, the book surprised me and I enjoyed it very much. Yes, it's different, but it's all very interesting. The imprinting thing with Jacob and Renesmee even made sense, and though the Bella-Edward dynamic was different than it has been, their romance is still obviously there. I think many people were expecting certain things, and that's why they're disappointed. Also, I don't think Stephanie Myer is trying to send any messages with the story; about marrying and having children young, not going to college, etc. Bella is a vampire, after all, and we all knew her life wasn't going to take the \\"normal path\\"...highschool, college, then married, etc, etc. People also complained about the lack of action, but even without fighting scenes like Eclipse, the tension was still there when Bella was struggling for her life and the baby's, and when Alice disappeared and they gathered to meet the Volturi. I think people should stop trying to find fault with the book because it's not what they personally wanted it to be, and accept and enjoy the story for what it is, which is very good.
031606792X|5.0|I've been hooked on this series since Twilight came out, and I wasn't disappointed with the conclusion to the series. Everything turned out how I had hoped it would, with a few twists to it I never saw coming.
031606792X|1.0|Bottom line:    The main conflict [Edward v Jacob] is resolved in the very beginning of the novel, leaving absolutely no suspense; too much emphasis on sex; Meyer throws out any previous rules she had set for the series; according to Meyer, it's totally fine to have a baby at 18; the Jacob-Nessie thing is the most disturbing thing I've ever read in my life; you shouldn't feel trashy when reading a love story.    I had elaborated but my window somehow disappeared, and now I realize that's really all there is to this book. I do not recommend this fourth installment to anyone.    Let's just say I'm pretending that the series ends at Eclipse.
031606792X|1.0|I loved the first three and highly anticipated the fourth. It was a contrived goose chase that ended in a pretty pink bow. Everything that i loved about the first three dissipated in Breaking Dawn. I would not recommend this book.
031606792X|5.0|I did not think that I would want this series to end the way that it did because normally I do not like books that are tied up perfectly.  But I really enjoyed reading this book and thought that it was the best of the series.
031606792X|1.0|I have never loved any series the way I did the Twilight Saga.  This final installment is a travesty.  As a diehard Twihard, I can't even begin to tell you how disappointed I was when the story and characters I so loved were reduced to a piece of truly crappy fan fiction.  It doesn't even seem like the same author.  I will always love Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse, but my love affair with Stephanie Meyer is over.  I will spend a long time doing my level best to forget I ever read this book.  If J.K. Rowling had jumped ship like this, it would have started riots.  I hope, for her sake, Mrs. Meyer's fans are more forgiving.
0312379293|3.0|I've read all of Jeffery Archer's books, and love a good mystery, so much that when I find a good book, I keep on reading until the end.  I really wanted to love this book, but it was a slow start and parts were somewhat contrived.  I did read to the end, but will only recommend it as a beach or dead-of-winter read.
031606792X|5.0|I haven't read Breaking Dawn yet because I don't want it to end, I can't believe how many people don't like the book, not sure if I will read it. I would like to see a prequel to the the series, I want to know more about each of the Cullens before they became a family. More about what they were like when they were human and then about each of them being turned.........
B0018TLRTU|4.0|This Album was great, and i was feeling like an Teenager.  Great Songs and Great Videos.  All Guy who loves the 80's buy it.
031606792X|3.0|The series was most certainly at its best with \\"Twilight\\" and flowed smoothly through the next two installments with the story changing and surprising the reader rather than becoming disjointed. However, this easy flow is interrupted and turned on its head with the fourth installment. I give Meyer props for writing the unexpected (surely there was not one reader who was not shocked by certain twists), but I was also slightly uncomfortable with how much the style and tone deviated from that of the original trilogy. The innocence and humor of the characters that I have come to love flounders here, and personalities change with little explanation. I found myself pausing and trying to re-paint the portraits of the main characters as some actions conflicted with what I had been told about them in previous books. Like other reviewers here, some parts of the novel left me feeling like I was reading a fanfiction as opposed to the work of Meyer, who previously impressed me with her knack for storytelling in not only the Twilight Saga, but in \\"The Host\\" (which is worth a read). I think most of the harsher reviews for this novel are stemming from reactions to the surprise plot twists in the story, and most of the extreme contempt portrayed in those reviews is undeserved. While this is not Meyer's best work, and it is clearly not what many fans wanted after suffering through the anticipation, it is exciting, unexpected, and will definitely keep you guessing.
031606792X|5.0|I really am sad that its over. Yet I'm glad that all that needed to be resolved was. I was very content with this book. I screamed, I threw a tantrum or three, I was sad, anxious and happy! What is wrong with happily every after. This was at its heart a romance. Edward and Bella had sacrificed throughout the series, struggled, and won. I was glad for the ending. It gives me peace.
019431510X|5.0|I have been using it for the last decade to improve my english. I am not a native english speaker and just on its own it helped me improve my vocabulary a great deal. Enough to get admission into IIM!
031606792X|1.0|Horrible, filler, astounding, atrocious are words not enough to even begin to describe this abomination. You'd think after three books, Stephenie Meyer would get better. This is not so. Reading this book was not a pleasure, more of a chore. And to think that teens and even adults in their 40-50's are addicted to a book such as this. Stephenie is a manipulative writer, writing specifically to fill the void of teens that long for a boyfriend like Edward, and for those who wish their husbands to be him. This book had so many ties to one another, it was ridiculous. Almost as if Stephenie sat down and said \\"because this happend, this will happen now, and because that happened, this will happen.\\" It's hard not to spoil people, because I'd rather let people read this themselves and laugh 'til the end of time. Keep your receipts, ladies.
031606792X|5.0|This book was a fantastic ending to an awesome series.  I want to thank Stephenie Meyer for writing a wonderfully romantic \\"clean\\" love story with a lot of suspense and action that all ages can enjoy.  I was just introduced to these book this summer and my 13 year old daughter and I both couldn't put the books down.  We look forward to reading more of her work.
031606792X|5.0|The fairy tale ending that everyone hope for! It was so sweet and romantic. It was kinda weird..but thats ok!!
031606792X|1.0|As enormously disappointing as BD was I'm not entirely surprised. I always felt like SM was writing herself into a wall, but I had hoped that she would dazzle us with an epic finale. Boy was I wrong.  BD is a romantic sci-fi for teenagers about lust, sex, pregnancy, and abortion.     Even through the climax of the book, I found myself relatively bored. Although much of the book I did not see it coming, I was rarely surprised. There are plot holes you can drive an ice cream truck through, I was no longer able to relate to any of the characters, I felt like I was reading an episode of The Twilight Zone, instead of Twilight.    I give SM an A for capitalizing on a good thing and an F for effort. Boo
081541028X|4.0|Collins writes a richly detailed and intelligent account, laced with smart-alecky humor, of what it was like to join the astronaut corps, the training and planning that go into a mission, and what it's like to go into space. His description of his anxiety during the period that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the moon really puts you in the moment and makes you realize that making it back was no foregone conclusion.<br /><br />It makes me sad to see how this book has become dated. We as a nation gave up on manned space exploration 35 years ago, and the shuttle has been a dead end. While I reading the book, I felt a sense of futility that Collins, who wrote the book in the '70s, could never have anticipated.<br /><br />Carrying the Fire is an excellent astronaut memoir; maybe one day there'll be a reason for somebody to write some new ones.<br /><br />Reviewer: Liz Clare, co-author of the historical novel \\"To the Ends of the Earth: The Last Journey of Lewis and Clark\\"
031606792X|1.0|I waited for this book to come out. I loved Twilight, liked New Moon and Eclipse (and The Host), and thought Breaking Dawn would finish the love story. WRONG! This is a stupid, creepy story. (Spoiler alert!)  Bella drinking blood while a half-breed baby rips her apart from the inside? Sick! And then Jake imprinting on the baby?!!! This is worse than amateur fan fic! I thought Stephenie Meyer was a true, rising talent. I was wrong.
B000HWZ5WE|4.0|I had this record back when it was issued in the mid-80's.  I remember Robert Plant took a lot of flak from his Led Zepplin base of fans for making a recording that deviated from the Led Zep formula.  God forbid those fans ever listen to any other genre of rock.<br /><br />I bought the CD for the recording of \\"There's Good Rockin\\" which has a  driving rhythm, Jeff Beck on lead guitar and a fantastic horn section.  There's an added bonus track of \\"There's Good Rockin\\" live.<br /><br />The other tunes are pleasant enough to listen too.  There's some nostalgia in this record for me too.  my girlfriend, who is not my wife of 15 years, used to screw our brains out while this song was playing.  Gonna give it another try on CD.
031606792X|1.0|Before I actually purchased the book, I went here, to Amazon, to read some reviews about Breaking Dawn to make sure it had lived up to its hype.    To my surprise, it hadn't.    I accidentally came across a few spoilers, and I read them, mouth agape. Bella pregnant? Jacob's convenient imprinting? It all sounded like a immature fifteen year old's fanfiction. However, I was determined to give the book a fighting chance, and bought it at a bookstore right near my house.    The next day, I returned it, fully read and smothered in my hatred.    Where do I even start? The first few chapters of the initial Bella story were written in a tasefully familiar fashion. Bella was still somewhat relatable, and I was able to fully tolerate any writing blips that Meyer had made.    After the honeymoon had started, however, I quickly began to lose patience with the story.    Edward became an emotionally detatched nitwit with only his lust to drive his love for Bella. Bella, in turn, was equally sex-crazed, and slowly became a one-dimensional character. Her stubborn love for her mutant spawn only made her infuriatingly untolerable, and I began to wish she would be mercilessly killed by the Volturi at the end.    Carlisle was written horribly as well, and came off as just plain idiotic when he had to have another person, a werewolf/shape-shifter whatever, tell him that a vampire might like to drink blood. At that point, I knew something horribly wrong was going to happen to the rest of the characters -- and the plot.    My remedy: Bella should not have been both pregnant and turned into a  vampire in the same book. In fact, the pregnancy should have been eradicated altogether. I'd like to shake Meyer's editor by the shoulders and make him or her see the monstrosity that they allowed published. The pregnancy did nothing for the plot, the characters, or the health of the series altogether. It added unnecessary fluff, and a convenient way to end Jacob's reign as a deep and satisfyingly affectionate character.     I also believe that Bella's transformation hurt the book as well. What had made Bella special as a character was the fact that she was HUMAN. A human who could not trust that everything around her wasn't magical in some way. It is what turned her fans onto her in the first place; the belief that even ordinary people such as ourselves could play a part in a beautiful world that previously only existed in our dreams.     After Bella had made the change, she turned the book into something common -- the typical garbage about being drafted into a vampire clan, and then NOTHING EVER BEING THE SAME AGAIN. It's OK, Meyer. We've seen that written before; no need to give us your own little spin off.    Finally, in my opinion, the Volturi SHOULD have eradicated the Cullen clan, leaving only Bella, Jacob, and Renesmee alive. Would have at least provided a slight cliffhanger into Midnight Sun. Yes, people, there is going to be another one. If her editor allows it.    RECAP: Bella and Edward's love turns to lust, pregnancy had nothing to offer the story, Jacob is conveniently disposed of, all other characters fall flat, and the climax is any but.     Borrow it first, get your own opinion, then buy. If your stomach can handle it.
031606792X|3.0|I am not a teenager, in fact I am the mother of a 16-year-old. I first heard about the Twilight saga in Entertainment Weekly. As a writer, an English teacher and an avid reader, I was fascinated. I devoured the first 3 books--absolutely in love with the story and while I found Bella's behavior in New Moon a bit annoying and immature, I took into consideration the fact that the books were written for young adults and at that age they do feel love and heartbreak in an all-consuming way. Yes, Bella is immature, yes, she is fairly one-dimensional. I often thought along the way that Edward couldn't read her mind because there wasn't much going on there to begin with. I was often puzzled as to what he found so intensely attractive about her beyond her unique scent. But I was willing to go along with it because I so enjoyed Edward and Jacob. I had a few ideas as to how Breaking Dawn would play out, but I never imagined Meyer would go in this direction. Bella's pregnancy was ridiculous enough, but Jacob imprinting on the baby went too far. I found Quil and Claire disturbing enough without having to deal with Jacob and Nessie. And can we talk about that name? I think the middle name of Carlie would have been so much better and Charlie and Carlisle were so much more central to Bell'as story than dippy Renee and poorly defined Esme. I wanted Bella to have to choose--but Meyer neatly took that choice away by making it imperative to turn Bella to save her. As for the Volturi--I was really looking forward go a good fight with the Volturi being destroyed. Instead--everyone made nice and only Irinia is killed. As another reviewer wrote, this story ends for me with Eclipse. Breaking Dawn read like it belonged to another story and was written by another writer, An opportunity to write a truly classic and heartbreaking love story was lost and instead everyone lived happily ever after. In the best books, just as in real life, there is no happily ever after. There is choice, there is consequence, there is heartbreak and loss, but if you are truly lucky, there is love.
031606792X|5.0|*SPOILERS*<br />I loved this book!  It was so different than the other three books in the series.  It was almost a separate book in a way.  I loved all of the twists and turns that happened in the book.  I know that a lot of people were upset with the book, because of the baby and all that happens in Book 2.  For those that don't know, Breaking Dawn is separated into 3 books.  Bella, Jacob, and Bella, in that order.<br />I loved Nessie, or should I say Renesmee.  I also know that a lot of people were upset with the name, but I think it is cute.  I also don't know how people could NOT like that child.  She was just amazing, her character was fantastic.<br />I was glad that Edward finally got over the baby in the second book of Breaking Dawn.  For the most part, in Book 2, he was totally against the child and you could not blame him, what with Bella suffering like she did.  I was happy when he heard his daughter from the womb and finally started to call the \\"thing\\" as he kept saying, a baby.<br />You could tell in the beginning of the Third Book that he loved the child just as much as Bella.<br />Some people said that they would have liked more info on her being a vampire, but I thought that the info was just enough.  I also thought that yes, there were a lot of loopholes, what with it being the end of the series, but I liked that.  It gives you the sense that their lives are just beginning instead of ending, like it would have felt if Stephenie Meyer had written the book that was expected.<br /><br />I loved that it was totally filled with surprises and that when you read it, it wasn't a book that you expected.  It kept you on the edge of your seat, Literally!!!<br />I am going to reread and get even more info that I may have missed in my hasty attempt to get through it!
031606792X|1.0|I can't believe I waited so long to read something so disappointing. It's like watching the finale of Will and Grace. A literary trainwreck. The magic I felt between Edward and Bella was completely lost in this book. I wanted to rip out the first 120 pages and attach them to the back of Eclipse. I wasn't going to write a review but it pissed me off that the numbers of people who like and hate it are almost equal. I wonder what is going through their heads. I'm returning my copy. I haven't made up my mind about the movie.....
031606792X|1.0|There's not much to say that hasn't already been said. The book is simply like horrible fan fiction. Everything that readers loved about the first three books is gone.    Bella becomes more annoying than ever, causing a thousand problems because of her inability to ever consider other people's feelings or what the greater good may be. Edward doesn't want her to be a vampire in the beginning - She doesn't care and asks him to compromise everything he believes in and take her soul. Jacob is in love with her - She leads him on more and more. She becomes pregnant with some vampire-human hybrid that's killing her, Edward, Jacob, and ripping apart the werewolf clan that was once her only set of friends - Oh well, she doesn't care about any of that. It's all about her.    People want a good ending, but not the way Breaking Dawn gives it.     I was so excited for this book that I went to a midnight release party for it, but that was a waste of time. The book is a chore to even get through.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Planet Earth Blu-ray is an incredible viewing experience. I highly recommend it for all viewers.
031606792X|4.0|I'm a 28 year old man who started this series a couple weeks ago not  really knowing that its fanship is almost exclusively made up of  teenage girls.  Well, I like it regardless; it's not outstanding  writing, but the characters are addictive and it makes a decent  fantasy.  I was eagerly anticipating the fourth installment, but with  several fears in mind.    My greatest fear for this book was that it would spend too long  wearing the too worn paths the series had walked before.  Love  triangle.  Angst.  Some reason would appear for Bella to not become a  vampire, or not until the end of the book.  Bella would continue to do  little to distinguish herself but suffer and complain about innocuous  things (parties).  The most interesting cards in Meyer's hands, placed  there when the story was set up in Twilight (such as Bella's  conversion), would be held longer than they should or not be played at  all.    (Spoilers below)    So I, for one, am very happily surprised.  None of my fears came true  in the least.  I much prefer radical changes (Bella having a baby), to  more of the same.  Meyer's played the cards I wanted her to, and let  us enjoy them -- the wedding and honeymoon took up the first part of  the book, and then Bella's experience as a new vampire got ample  space.  In between those pieces, were 200 pages of Jacob's  perspective, which, in spite of previously disliking the Jacob  character, I enjoyed and felt characterized him well.    The radical changes seem to upset many.  But I'm afraid I agree with  the typical negative review of the previous books more than with those  of Breaking Dawn.  I think the changes, though radical, were all  clearly foreshadowed in the previous installments (Rosalie's character  was set up for her part in BD, Quil's imprinting got us ready for  Jacob's, etc).  So I'd like to think that Meyer didn't pull any of  this out of her hat at the last moment.  I personally don't mind the  pieces fitting together too neatly.  That'spart of the fun of  storytelling.    The weakest part, I would say, was the last 200 pages -- the Volturi  conflict.  Well, it's never been a series about violent conflict.  The  violent conflicts seem to pop up towards the end of the books out of  obligation.  Maybe it would have seemed more meaningful to some  readers if major characters died.  Yet I don't think that's exactly  right for this series.  It's not *epic*.
031606792X|5.0|Having read the whole series now, it is obvious that the author has come a long way (for the better) in her writing, not that she was bad to start with.  The descriptions are handled beautifully, especially the scenes involving physical changes to the characters.  The plot is not only creative but very clever.  This author has the ability to make something that would normally be really disgusting sound almost acceptable, which is quite a talent.        I found it easy to connect with the very \\"real\\" characters, thanks in part to the accomplished writing.  There is wit and humor along with lots of excitement.  It's a good blend.  I was laughing one minute, then on edge the next.  A great finale!
031606792X|1.0|So much of what I would like to say about Breaking Dawn has already been written in far more succinct words then I have - but I still feel inclined to offer my own review.    I have loved this series from the moment I opened Twilight.  I have sung SM's praises to anyone who would listen and could not have been more excited for a book to come out.    To say that I am let down does not begin to express my disappointment.    There were a few parts that I loved -     * The Wedding - it was emotional, romantic and very fulfilling.   * The First Night of the Honeymoon - so scared, so in love, so passionate.  \\"why am I covered in feathers\\" muwhahahaa  * Seth - what a wonderful character - he rocks..  * The joking and banter between Jacob and Rosalie    I completely found the idea of Bella and Edward having a baby together wonderful - surprising as I didn't think it was possible- but at that point, it was still a pleasant surprise. I eagerly read forward - expecting so much drama and angst and excitement.    and then disaster struck      Here is a bit of what I did NOT enjoy -     * Where is the Edward I know and love?  He has been reduced to so much of a supporting character (heck, even Jacob who IS a supporting character gets his own book in the story). During most of the book, particularly after the baby is born - I was desperate to have his p.o.v..and I got got nada.      * Poor Leah - this girl has suffered so much - first with Sam, then from being the only female of a truly male dominant pack.  When the packs split and she joined Jacob and Seth, I was truly hopeful that she would imprint with Jake (and I have to admit - I find the entire concept of imprinting horrific - but I usually just try hard to go with it).  After how Sam treated her - she was finally turning around.  She would be the perfect choice as not only Jake's beta - but his mate..    sigh    which leads me to my biggest issue (and the one that will ensure I now stop trying to encourage my daughter to read this series)    *  Jacob imprinting on Edward and Bella's infant daughter. So wrong, so very wrong on so very many levels.  Spare me the total BS of \\"it's not romantic at this point- he's her protector\\". Spit in the face of free will, why don't we.   I will use the words of a fellow reviewer here as they aptly summed up my issues in language that is still respectable( and SM def. deserves our respect)     \\" Jacob imprints on little Nessie, Edward and Bella's daughter. BAD IDEA. Now they really can be one big, happy family, just like those folks on that ranch in Texas. He used to fantasize about Bella naked and pregnant with his babies, now just see what he's got to look forward to with Nessie after he finishes fathering a couple of her half-siblings! He won't even have to wait that long, because she'll reach maturity by age 7. This just doesn't work on any level, except maybe for incestuous polygamists.\\"    Jacob should have killed himself in shame when his imprinting occurred. At least he would have his dignity. Admittedly, I find the concept of imprinting to be very distasteful under the best of circumstances but this is an abomination.  The very epitome of awful.     Why not Leah or Tanya or anyone, literally ANYONE other then the child of the woman he wanted to spend the rest of his life with just weeks before.  Nothing more convenient then to help raise your future wife.  It makes me literally green with disgust. I can think of countless ways to include Jacob as a permanent member of Bella's family - this is just completely unacceptable and the major part of what ruined this book for me    As a mother - I am sickened. As a reader, I am greatly disillusioned.    Any chance that the real Breaking Dawn comes out next Friday and we were just Group Punked?  I wish I could get a magic clock and stop myself from reading Breaking Dawn. I want to pretend that the series ends at Eclipse

0553589059|2.0|Undertow: by Elizabeth Bear  There are many things I like about the book including the depiction of the city on floats which reminded me of Sausalito back in the 60s. I liked how they would change the city to deal with storms, that seemed like a nifty idea, particularly in places like New Orleans where storms will devastate the low country. And most of all I liked the aliens, except where they are written as the racist \\"noble savage\\".     This brings me to my several struggles with this book. The characters in the book are a sociopathic murderer, a dissociated hacker, a narcissistic conjure man, and several corporate leader types and other indistinguishably similar unpleasant human types. In some cases there are duplicates of these as well. Then we have the noble savage aliens who actually have legitimate issues based on the story. The problem that I had was that the apparent protagonist is the sociopath and I don't invest well with murderers no matter how pretty you shine them up. The secondary characters are equally off-putting with the exception of the aliens.     As a reader it is incredibly difficult to invest in these violent, oppressive persons' issues. These are the people I dislike intensely in real life, the ones who think they can simply violate the rights of everyone else. Determined to finish this book (the first Bear book I've managed to finish) I decided to slough through these issues for the gems that must exist to explain these choices.     I appreciated that she gave a go at Shrodingers Cat and quantum theory even if I didn't quite believe her conclusions about how things work. I didn't appreciate so much the long expository sections where she explained her theories either. However, I determined and muddled through these sections too.     I was feeling good, however, there were only a few pages of book left and...and...well, she contrived to put the alien in a position to discover the bad corporate guys were going to commit genocide and oh no...thenoble savage must save se whole species by killing everyone on board the ship. This was a complete reversal of the alien policy of non-war presented thickly throughout the book. This was the \\"go to\\" human answer of violence, murder, death is the \\"good\\" answer. And in one fell swoop the aliens became humans in froggy costumes doing evil and suddenly I had no one left to root for turning the book into an airborne object of rejection.    SUMMARY: I don't consider a book well written if it pops me out a lot and I had this problem with this book. I noted the overuse of the word \\"oily\\" and it popped me out four times early in the book. I also didn't like the head-hopping quality that kept me from really liking the characters. The selection of unlikable characters coupled to the \\"special gizmo\\" one had stashed on the planet and the \\"special circumstances\\" where one alien must kill a lot of people to save the world - these are trope fantasy and even though this is positioned as SF - it is, in my opinion, really a dressed up fantasy novel and the slide is magic.

031606792X|5.0|I don't even understand those we have written terrible reviews for the book, I guess they didn't really read the first three books to understand that the Bella/Edward/Jacob story followed the natural course that it should have.  The actual plot of this book was completely original, I thought, and extremely entertaining.  The book was very hard to put down.
031606792X|3.0|I have read the first three books of the twilight saga numerous of times, and i was really excited about the fourth coming out. it wasn't at ALL what i expected, but not necesarily in a bad way.  I liked the fact that i was constantly in shock over each event that took place in the book. I think it was a good ending to the series.  Bella got what she wanted... and she DID sacrifice herself FOR love.  She sacrificed herself for her baby, she knew she could, and probably WOULD die, but was willing to pay that price if it ment savinf her baby.  And it ended well for Jacob too because he was freed from the painfull hold that Bella had on him, and how fitting is it that he IMPTINTED on HER baby?? i thought that was both ironic and sweet, but also a little freaky.     Sure, the book wasn't at all what i excepted, but i didn't expect it to be.  I love a happy ending, and that is exactly what this book has.     i also love how she switched from bella's perspective to Jacob's perspective.      I do admit that it draged a little in places, and i just wished she would get on with it.... but over all, i think it was still good... just very DIFFERENT than the first three.
031606792X|5.0|I'm shocked by all the negativity directed at this book.  Who did people think they were reading, Margaret Atwood?  Of course everything was going to come out roses and sunshine.  The reason that this is a good novel in its genre is that while you are reading it, you're not always so sure that everything will work out.   Is it a monster baby?  Will the wolves and vampires destroy one another?  Did Alice and Jasper run away from their family because Alice saw no hope?  Will Edward and Bella turn out to be another Romeo and Juliet, i.e. dead?  These questions keep the reader turning the page even though the rational mind already knows the ending.    In this book the key ingredient was the love for a child.  We already knew that Bella and Edward loved one another beyond the norm.  It was a smart decision on the author's part to shift the focus to another kind of love.  It is this love that allows Bella to come into her own.  Meyer seems to be playing with the theme of a mother's love and fear for her children bringing her great strength (e.g. mothers lifting cars to save their children,) as it was fear for Renesmee that allowed Bella the will to control her new power, not fear for Edward.  Bella was prepared time and again to sacrifice herself for her daughter; Renesmee's survival was the most important thing.  But perhaps this theme is either not appropriate or appreciated by younger readers (this is YA lit, after all.)    Many were made uncomfortable by the pairing of Bella's age along with marriage and motherhood.  I do not think that the author is saying, \\"Hey, high school grads, go find yourselves a hot man, pop out a kid, and forget about your own lives.\\"  This is fantasy fiction.  Bella had to be this young age for motherhood if the theme of parental love was to be introduced.  Besides if you want to complain about inappropriateness, let's be bothered by the fact that someone in his nineties (Edward) was hot for a teenager.  Now no one is bothered by that fact (or it they were, they probably didn't bother reading the series).  Why, because it's sci-fi where real world issues like age don't matter as much.  I found the \\"traditional\\" marriage a bit quaint, but certainly not enough to ruin the story.    All in all, I've enjoyed spending the last two days in this world.  The book was crack-lit (i.e. literature that you know is not the best, but it's just so addictive, you can't put it down,) just like the other three.  That's why, when I pulled my head out, that I was so shocked all negative reviews.
031606792X|4.0|After reading all the bad reviews, I was prepared to hate this book.  I didn't really like Eclipse all that well, so I figured this one would be worse.  But I found myself really enjoying it most of the way through.  There were some parts I found silly (naming the baby Renesmee/Nessie - ouch!), but I didn't find the story nearly as bad as so many others apparently have.  And I loved kick-butt, sexy vampire Bella.  I was satisfied at the conclusion, and smiling when I closed the book.
0385340990|5.0|This book is not only an enjoyable read but a wonderful tribute to the arts themselves as it is a nod to how novels,and poetry can have you enter into a pleasurable existance at times in spite and in face of horrors that surround us.<br />As a book lover that was a message I enjoyed.
031606792X|5.0|Never has a book held me in such tight suspense. Each of the 3 \\"books\\" keeps the reader tightly wound and feeling the tensions of Bella and Jacob.   I don't have much to say but that I loved it and Meyer did an amazing job of securely closing the story.    Bravo.
0743298039|5.0|I found The Thirteenth Tale to be a delightful, wonderful and haunting tale. The characters of Vida Winter and Margaret Lea are developed in an excellent way that allows the reader to feel as though they know both women. Though Vida is a very complex character, she is also one that the reader can find compassion for and holds a mystery until the very end.<br /><br />The Thirteenth Tale is a story within a story. In addition, the story follows both Vida's life, as well as Margaret's life and the torment that she is feeling within. The secondary characterization is excellent and lends greatly to the story and though there are many secondary characters within the story, the superb writing makes it easy to follow along.<br /><br />I give The Thirteenth Tale my highest recommendation, to anyone looking for an engrossing read that will keep you wondering and guessing until the very end.
031606792X|5.0|I thought this was the perfect end to Bella and Edward's story.  It was full of emotion and sacrifice (despite reviews to the contrary) and it really sucked me in.  It shocked me because the turn the story took caught me completely by surprise, and I like that Stephenie can create another turn when you'd think she'd pretty much exhausted the whole angst-filled relationship thread.  To be honest, i thought that this book was mainly going to focus on Bella coping with losing her humanity and then her new body/instincts. And it was so much different than I thought! There are so many different story lines and plot developments that I'm surprised she fit it all into one book and made it feel complete.  I think she did an absolutely amazing job.      In reply to the ranting reviews...  ****SPOILER ALERT****  Some people think the Jake/Nellie thing was a cop out because Stephenie just wanted Jake to find happiness away from Bella.  And that might partially be true, but I felt more like Bella was passing her humanity on and that's what Jake was truly connected to.  (Remember the whole soul mates in a normal world thing?  So her soul moved on to a body he was allowed to love...)    Someone said something about \\"lucky Bella getting it all, husband, happy friend, and a baby\\" and it took so much pain and sacrifice for that to come about that there was very little feeling of \\"luck\\" about it.  I felt like I was fighting for that happiness right along with her.    And then there was the whole \\"married at 18?!?!  how could this happen?\\"  And that was where the book was headed from day one so I don't see how thats a surprise, and I'm a little shocked at all the reviews railing against that.  I'm in no way a supporter of early marriage, but there are circumstances (such as the supernatural) that kind of put the relationship into a realm of its own.    There's so much more than that, but instead of trying to turn this book into some statement about female empowerment or lack thereof,I prefer to just enjoy the story for what it is: a love story.  Whether thats between lovers, friends, or family.  Because that's obviously what all these books are about.      It does a great job of conveying emotions and the tense scenes had me nearly screaming.  I've never been so sucked into a series before.  Ever.  And I feel like this is an ending I can live with, because anything else would have felt like she was straying from the message she's been trying to make throughout the entire series.  (That whole love conquers all thing...)    I highly recommend reading all these books!
031606792X|2.0|As a huge fan of Twilight, I found Breaking Dawn a messy attempt at wrapping up the series. The previous 3 books focused on the main characters. Readers developed a good understanding of each character, their personalities, relationships, etc. Breaking Dawn seems to have thrown all that knowledge away. While the book itself wasn't horrible, it was mediocre at best. I admit that I found many parts suspenseful, but it wasn't suspenseful in a positive way. There are many twists in the book that make you go \\"Did she REALLY just write that?\\" followed by \\"Oh God, she did.\\" The suspense was wondering how the story could possibly end without leaving readers completely baffled by what had just happened.    <Slight Spoilers Start> The first few chapters were in typical Twilight mood, but then Breaking Dawn quickly turns into something else that barely resembles the same mood or flow found in the other 3 books. I found it hard to believe that Meyer moved the story so far away from Bella and Edward's relationship to the relationship between the baby and everyone else. It was no longer a story about a girl in love with a vampire troubled with forbidden love - there was hardly any deep storyline about Edward and Bella's relationship in the entire book.     Characters were so out of place and it seemed like they were no longer acting like themselves, the only one showing some consistency was Jacob. But then with Jacob imprinting on the baby threw that out the window. It would have made more sense just to have Jacob admit to have imprinted on Bella (what I originally believed) and have him leave La Push/Forks for good. Edward as a father didn't seem to have any connection with his daughter, and who knows what Bella was thinking the entire book.     The final showdown was quite a letdown as well. I would have hoped that at least 1 major character died because of the Volturi vs. Cullens epic battle, but I guess not.    Overall I felt a little cheap after reading the book. There weretoo many twists that were incredibly cheesy that it was hard to try and forget about them. It's too bad...
031606792X|5.0|Wow, I really have to say that I don't know how I totally feel about Breaking Dawn. I know I gave this five stars but yet i'm still a little confused. I have to admit I was a little bit of dissapointed but then at the same time happy. I was SO NOT expecting little Renesmee but I am glad that Bella ended up happy. I think i am just sad that this is the end and dissapointed that we didnt get to know Renesmee that well. This is still a great book though but I am sad to admit that I liked the other three books better. So I give this a 5 star even though I am still a little confused.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I mentioned to one of my friends when I ordered this series that I wanted to learn more about World War II. I had always known that World War II was terrible, but watching The World at War, I realised that I had not known the extent of how terrible it truly was. This experience has had a significant impact on me, and is not one that I will forget quickly.<br /><br />The scale of World War II was staggering. 50 million people lost their lives, including 20 million Russians. Although the total figure varies according to the methodology used, anywhere from 9 to 11 million Jews, Poles, Slavs, gypsies, gay men, political dissidents, people with disabilities and others were murdered by the SS and their supporters, most in the concentration and extermination camps of Auschwitz, Dachau and the like, names which have become synonymous with unspeakable horror and infamy. Whole cities (or large parts thereof), such as Warsaw, Dresden, Nagasaki and St Petersburg, to name just a few, were razed, acts that involved the indiscriminate slaughter of thousands of innocent civilians. The World at War covers the devastation waged on these, and other, cities.<br /><br />One thing I always remember from when I first watched this series, as a young boy in the 70s, is the opening music by Carl Davis, which is perfectly suited to the subject matter. Another thing I always remember about the opening is the very effective use of the various human faces fading into each other, and being engulfed by flames. I especially remember the face of the little boy.<br /><br />Some of the episodes I found the most gripping include the following: The Final Solution Parts 1 and 2; Warrior; Morning: June - August 1944 (about the Allied invasion of Normandy); Occupation: Holland 1940 - 1944; Nemesis: Germany February - May 1945; and Hitler's Germany: Total War 1939 - 1945. Of these, the episodes I found the most disturbing were The Final Solution Parts 1 and 2, about the Holocaust, and Warrior, an episode about soldiers and battle, which includes uncompromising and confronting archival footage, such as a scene showing a group of European soldiers unceremoniously tossing a comrade's corpse onto a stretcher and then into an open grave, and footage of the flame throwers the US soldiers used. I remember thinking when I watched the movie Saving Private Ryan, which also depicts the use of the flame throwers, that most people would be hesitant to use such cruel measures on a nest of cockroaches, let alone other human beings. I also found the images at the beginning of disc 5 particularly chilling, such as a young girl in The Netherlands standing under an anti-Semitic sign reading `Voor Joden verboden' - `Prohibited for Jews'.<br /><br />One of the most notable aspects of the series is the inclusion of many fascinating, and unbiased, interviews with people from both the Allied and Axis nations, including the following:<br /><br />- Interviews with Traudl Junge, Hitler's secretary<br /><br />- An interview with Richard Boch, an apparently reluctant SS officer, in which he recounts a conversation he had with a colleague whilst witnessing children who were hiding under piles of clothing being flung into the `showers' during a late-night gassing: `argh, I'm going to be sick, I can't stand this. Oh my', I said, `Karl, I've never seen anything like it in my life, it's absolutely terrible'. His friend later replied `you do get used to anything in time'.<br /><br />- An interview with Lord Avon, Foreign Minister of the British parliament at the time, in which he comments on the persecution of the Jews: `as the war progressed, some horrifying reports began to come out, and at first, it was very difficult naturally, to assess their accuracy, and they were indeed so horrible that it was hard to believe they could be true'.<br /><br />- An interview with a German translator, Hildegard Wortmann, in which she talks about hearing of Hitler's suicide: `I was so disappointed that he was such alousy, such a rotten coward, he had started the war, millions of dead people, everything was lost, in ruins, then he wanted to give up all responsibility and he just committed suicide, just like his mouthpiece Goebbels, I still hear Goebbels in my ears, do you want the total war, the yelling'.<br /><br />I have only a few minor criticisms of the series, for example, I was somewhat surprised that Josef Mengele, the despicable Nazi `doctor' responsible for performing monstrous experiments on sets of twins, was never specifically mentioned. However, the series overall is so brilliant that any minor criticisms cannot detract from the 5-star rating it so manifestly deserves. It is undoubtedly the definitive documentary of World War II, and you could most definitely not buy any other Word War II documentary and acquire a solid knowledge of the events that unfolded. It is the most expensive item I have purchased on Amazon to date, but it was worth every cent.<br /><br />The dark nightmare that was World War II embodied the most ghastly evil and blackest period that mankind has ever known, a reality accentuated by every episode of The World at War. The extremes of carnage, destruction and human suffering that the War entailed must never be forgotten, not in 50 years, not in 100 years, not in 500 years. The Holocaust, in particular, was utterly demonic, and although the ovens of Auschwitz, the most notorious death camp of all, are forever silenced, much of its physical entity remains as the Russians found it in January 1945, a reminder to the world of the depraved brutality that racism and bigotry can ultimately lead to. This can be summed up no better than by the powerful and indelible words which end The Final Solution - Part 2: `The ruins of Auschwitz are more than a memorial. As long as there is political intolerance, religious bigotry, racial prejudice, they are a warning. A warning that we all have a responsibility to see - that no-one builds another Auschwitz'.ons of dead people, everything was lost, in ruins, then he wanted to give up all responsibility and he just committed suicide, just like his mouthpiece Goebbels, I still hear Goebbels in my ears, do you want the total war, the yelling'.

031606792X|3.0|I was in the bookstore buying a copy of Breaking Dawn for my 14-year old daughter the moment the book hit the shelves.  She is a huge Twilight series fan, and absolutely devoured the first three books.  She couldn't wait to get her hands on this new book.  When she reached page 300-something, I heard her scream and then watched in dismay as she hurled the book across the room and began shouting, \\"I can't read this anymore!  I hate this book!  Stephanie Myer, what were you thinking??\\"  Apparently, her revulsion had to do with Bella's long and painful pregnancy that nearly killed her, and then with the horrifying twist of having Jacob imprint on Bella's newborn daughter, who will be...part vampire, part human, and part werewolf?  Because when you combine human chromosomes with vampire chromosomes, you get a werewolf?  Anyway, at this point in the story, she wants to give this book a one-star.  But to be fair she'll give this book three stars since she did not finish reading it.  She refuses to read any more of it.  I've never seen her react so viscerally to a story before. I know she feels betrayed, however, by this new and unexpected turn, and feels it's a huge betrayal of Jacob's love for Bella.
031606792X|5.0|I love this series, and this ending was very satisfying.  If you love the characters, I think you will find this book true to them.
031606792X|5.0|I won't say that Breaking Dawn was the book I expected it to be, because I had no idea what to expect. Perhaps that's why I loved it. Everything that is supposed to happen in the final book of a series happened. All the loose ends were tied up, and as the reader I felt that Bella and Edward's story was complete. It was a very emotional read, and it will probably take another read through for me to completely process everything that happened.  Stephenie Meyer should congratulate herself on a job well done.  And, of course, I can't wait for any future books in the Cullen universe!
031606792X|5.0|Breaking Dawn was meant to be the end of the series, why are people expecting more?  I admit, I wanted a little more action in the fight, but that is just what I want.  I think people should stop obsessing because they didn't get their ending.  People who are expecting more or are upset with the book or the author have no right to call themselves fans.  An ending is supposed to leave no more wondering or confusion.  Stephenie Meyer wrote it the way an ending was supposed to be, and did a damn amazing job.  So what if everything was tied up perfectly at the end, not like in reality...HELLO!  Can anyone say, \\"Work of fiction?\\"  You have \\"werewolves\\" (shape-shifters) and perfect vampires, *cough*Edward*cough*, of course it will all end perfectly!  That's why they call these things, \\"Happily Ever After\\".  Get over yourselves, you didn't write it!  Thank you Stephenie Meyer, and don't be discouraged by all the haters (they're jealous).  You proved yourself to be a #1 Bestseller and I couldn't be happier with the Twilight Saga.
B000V86OKG|5.0|Coming off the phenomenal first season what we have here is absolutely no sophomore slump.  Dexter season two has evolved in a good way...Less killing with more uncertainty and conflict swirling around Dexter and the almost equally great supporting characters.<br /><br />This show seems to have so much to interest anyone.  A fantastic locale.  A truly unique story around a very charasmatic central character.  Colorful supporting characters whose own personas help galvanize the viewer's interest.  Oh yeah, macabre death as a form of moral judgement at the hands of Dexter and \\"Harry's code\\".  A thousand word review is pointless if you saw season one...Season two is better, if that's possible?  I think that it might just be.  Highly recommended, and in the viewer's opinion the hands down best series since Dallas.  I only wish Mad Men's season two could be the same quality, not likely by that one's early indications.  Mad Men makes me appreciate Dexter even more!
031606792X|1.0|(MAJOR SPOILER ALERT!) I was so excited when I started reading this. And up until the end of Bella's first part, I was mostly alright with it. And then Bella ends up pregnant! What in the world was Stephanie Meyer thinking!? Pregnant? At eighteen? And FINE WITH IT!!!    Jacob's part of the book just made me dread even more what was going to happen. I knew that Jacob would never agree with the baby, and for the first time (no offence to Jacob fans) I was going to agree with him. And I was also glad that Edward himself disapproved of it. But hopefully I wasn't the only one who wished they would do something to Rosalie.    With Rosalie, in Jacob's part of the book, Stephanie had written a perfect place to put some well needed tension. And I loved how she played it out. But the fact that no one stopped her made me a little bit more that angry. And Edward's excuse--- he does whatever makes Bella happy--- was just stupid. Bella wanted James to find her and kill her, so Edward would be safe--- the first situation where what she wanted was death. But did Edward allow it? No! So why should this be any different?   Not to say that I wasn't, in a way, glad that the baby was a part of the book, or that I'm like, a major pro-abortion person. But seriously, it just doesn't seem right. And then the freaky Jacob-imprinting-on-Renesmee thing was just horrible. It's basically just like saying \\"Well, I had the hots for your mom, but then she had you, and you'll do\\" That's disturbing.   Bella as a vampire was always an interesting concept, and I always imagined the situation as the end of the series--- you're left to speculate what happens. But that obviously wasn't an option as of the end of  chapter 18. So, I was like, \\"Cool, Stephanie's written Bella into a situation where she's more exciting and better off.\\" Then I caught myself, and really thought about that. And thought that she was saying, \\"Death is never going to happen, because you can always get out of it.\\"   I read all of the book, but the ending was unsatisfying, and completely dumb, from my point of view. Twilight was amazing, as was New Moon and Eclipse, but this one left me feeling more than just disappointed, but disturbed. I didn't see it in the way that most people did--- Stephanie Meyer's supporting teenage pregnancy. I saw it as a disturbing view on life.   What I thought Stephanie was saying was that if you marry a super-hot guy and move into a cottage with him and have a baby with him, nothing will go wrong. Your best friend disapproves of your choices? Big deal, he'll get over it, because everything's perfect. That same best friend \\"imprints\\" on your newborn daughter? You'll get over it after awhile, and see how good it is, because everything's perfect. The pregnancy itself almost kills you? Big deal, I'll live, because everything's perfect. There can never be any problems with your life, because, hey, everything's perfect. You don't tell teenagers that whenever something like that happens to you (dismissing the sci-fi fantasy stuff), it will all turn out all right because everything's perfect. Sure, you want them to have a positive outlook, but if I wanted to read a book about how nothing bad ever happens \\"because everything's perfect\\", I would've read a dollar-store romance novel.
031606792X|4.0|I have to give this book, objectively, 4 stars.  At 750 pages, I felt that some parts were unnecessary, and that about 200 pages could have been shaved off of the book it would have earned a 5 star review.  To parents:  This book DOES have Bella and Edward having sex- a few times.    Anyways, in this book, we read Jacob's perspective for about 10-13 chapters, that could have been cut in half and some other parts, the waiting dragged out.  Overall, I did enjoy the final book in the series, especially their wedding, honeymoon and choices they made and how it affected this Cullen Family.  Great End to a Great Series.
031606792X|1.0|The books first 6 1/2 chapters are vary good after that however to books is (and I do not use this phrase lightly) god awful. I have been a SM fan for years reading twilight only a few days after its was first released. I have waited for all of her books and have never been the lest bit unhappy until now.     when I started reading I don't see were the characters were coming from. They acted different and seemed different    when in chapter 8 the book changed to Jakes point of view you can see the book is going down hill. I am not a team Edward or team Jake fan so for me it wasn't the end of the world but after 10 chapters of his never ending whining I wanted to burn the book.     another point I would like to make was that there was no plot to the book until close to 500 pages into the book. yes Bella has a baby but still there's no plot just \\"oh no! what should we do!\\" over and over again.     My last point I shall make is simply this. when I first read Twilight, New Moon and Eclipse I thought the most interesting part of the book was that what ever path Bella chose ( To be with Edward but leave her family behind or to be with Jake and leave Edward grow old and die) she would lose something but would also gain something as well she would never have it all but in this book she loses nothing and every thing is easy for her.    there was no twists and turns. I suggest reading breaking dawn as a joke and didn't think of it as the end of the twilight Saga.  Over all a vary bad book.
B000K2Q5X4|5.0|Hands down the best CD by this band.  This was just before they started their more commercial era and I tell you what this one finds it's way into my CD player just as much as the day I bought it.  If you haven't discovered the other side of Whitesnake this is a good place to start.  One word PHENOMENAL!
031606792X|5.0|This book was tastefully written and completely in line with the rest of the fantasy stories that Stephenie Meyer has produced.  It's a fairytale, albeit one with vampires and werewolves instead of princesses, but a fairytale nonetheless.  I think that people who are criticizing the death out of this book have played up the other novels too much, had too much time to fantasize about their own ending to Ms. Meyer's story.  Yes, HER story.  So Bella gets her husband and her baby and her best friend and her family, and it all has a neat little bow and she even gets to keep her human family.  Somehow, she gets to keep and have everything and it's not good enough.  Somehow, SM wove a story in such a way that was creative and imaginative and thought out enough to tie up all loose ends, answer all questions and make everything turn out happily ever after.  That seems like it would be a very difficult thing to do, but she did it.  Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty ended the same way, and they are classics.  It may not be YOUR idea of a perfect ending, but it's not a reason the bash the hell out of the book.  It was written in the same descriptive, warm way that her other books were written and it puts you right there with the characters.  No one loves her books because of the \\"extremely thought out and complicated\\" storyline, they all love her books because they love the characters and the feeling of knowing them all personally and being right there with them.  This book follows the same rules, even though it may not have the ending that you were anticipating.
031606792X|4.0|Honestly, I think the fact that a large majority of her fan base is teenage girls is what's affecting this divided opinion.    Let's be honest, for the most part the book finally starts getting out of it's hopelessly romantic true love naivety and deals with adult themes.   I'm sure it was a slap in the face to the WB watching part of the nation.      I personally found it refreshing.  IMO  she avoided the 'cop out' ending and instead decided to take us into left field and go somewhere no one expected.      I still think Bell is a strong character.  While events unfolded that took some choice away, she did make hard choices after that, life-threatening choices, and stuck to her goals.  I've seen people criticize her \\"family at 18, no college\\" decision.    Um...She's immortal.  The baby will be an adult in 7 years.   What do you think she'll be doing the rest of her milleniums?      Really.  I don't see how people got so irritated with this, unless they wanted to series to finish in the uninspired cliche direction it was heading.    I applaude the author for having the guts to obviously stray from the easy path and to finish the story as she meant for it to go.    The rest need to go back to their harlequin romances.  Please stop trying to keep american entertainment in it's dumbed down, lowest common denominator phase that it's been stuck in for the last decade.
031606792X|5.0|I am not a die hard fan and was just recently introduced to the books. I have read them all in succession and loved all of them. Maybe because I am not a huge fan I can enjoy the book without picking apart all the details. Frankly after reading all the reviews I thought this book was going to be horrendous. I wasn't even going to buy it! Especially after reading that the authors career is over  i thought it would have no plot etc. I found it enjoyable.  This series is not as good as the Harry potter( frankly these books are in a class of their own) but certainly worth the read versus book burning etc  I hope people give it a chance and don't let the reviews keep you from this book.
031606792X|3.0|Many aspects of this book does not match up, and the personalities were lost and confused in the new direction Meyer decided to go.  Everyone ended up being happy, but the story itself did not satisfy me as a reader.<br /><br />3/5 stars if that.  This book could have definitely been better in so many ways.
031606792X|1.0|While not being a complete diehard fan of the Twilight series I did love the previous three books and enjoy The Host quite a bit. I was looking forward to this book but after reading it I find myself feeling very let down. I won't go into the book's flaws, as I feel numerouse other reviews have already made them clear, I will say that reading Breaking Dawn felt like reading a book completely separate from the previous three Twilight novels. Standing alone, the book would have been average, but compared with the series before it, I found myself mystified as to how this story fit in, and what had happened to the character's I had grown to love. The only character in this book who I found myself actually connecting to was Jacob, which was somewhat ironic for me, having never been fond of his character. In all, I felt the book could have been 200 pages shorter had Stephenie Meyer not continously taken the time to explain \\"how happy\\" Bella was. I mean, give me a break! Where was the action, the angst, and the tension, which drew me in to the first three books so completely? Where was the sacrafice that Bella had supposedly made? It just makes me mad, that after building the series up so dramatically, Meyer seems to completely dropped the ball on this novel. She should have stopped after three.
031606792X|1.0|I thought Twilight was very good and New Moon and Eclipse both certainly passable and worth my time.  Obviously, this series isn't a masterwork, but the first three books were fun and entertaining reads.  Breaking Dawn, however, was maybe the worst thing I have ever read in my life.  Really.<br /><br />*SPOILERS BELOW*<br /><br />The plot was the absolutely most stupid, asinine, utterly pathetic, uninspired thing I have ever read.  Yes, Stephenie Meyer wants everything to be tied up in a big bow and have a nice happy ending.  Okay, I get that.  But really, does that really mean that Bella has to have a baby (a very special, magical baby!) and give up college?  And did Jacob Black have to imprint on that baby?  That is all sorts of inbred and weird. I read the entire book (and yes, I complained the entire way though) and all I could think was, \\"Oh my god, I can't believe that this is as bad as it is.  All the adventure and charm of the first three books have been replaced with trite and miserable prose.  Dear god, tell me this is some sort of twisted joke\\".<br /><br />The worst part is, now that I read Breaking Dawn, the other books carry its taint!  I may keep Twilight, but I will probably sell the rest.  This series could have been good!  It could have ended so well.  I'm not sure what I would have chosen to end this book, but I'm pretty sure I would have liked anything better than what Breaking Dawn actually contained.  If you haven't read this book yet, I recommend you read Twilight and stop.  The ending of Twilight leaves a mystery that will keep your imagination going.  If you read all the way to Breaking Dawn, you will want to poke yourself in the eyes.  Really.<br /><br />I really wanted it to be good, if not at least reasonable.  Thats probably the biggest disappointment.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|If I could have imagined a more perfect book it couldn't be better than this. I truely loved this book and my heart was in my throat for so much of it to. Thank you so much to Ms. Meyer for writing this womderful story.
0061537934|5.0|I got this book out of the library, but now I'm buying it so that I can keep it on hand.  It's the kind of book I'd like to read again and again over the years.    The idea fascinated me - seeing the world through the eyes of the man's dog.  It is extremely well done, and is one of those books you think about later and mull over in your mind.    The ending was a complete surprise, and I actually went back and re-read it, because I really liked the way it ended.  Funny, warm, and so clear in the bond between canine and man.  I definitely recommend it!
031606792X|2.0|I am a huge fan of the Twilight series.  This book was very disappointing for such a wonderful series.  The story felt disjointed and choppy.  There were several scenes that I felt were out of place.  There were also some holes where I felt she could have elaborated more on the plot and the characters thoughts to draw the reader in.  I felt like Stephenie neglected Edward's and Bella's relationship, the central characters.  She didn't allow it to mature or grow.  In the process, neither did Bella.  The pregnant Bella was one dimensional and it was difficult to feel empathy.  Jacob's imprint felt like a cop out too.  I had to groan and roll my eyes.  We didn't get to enjoy the antics of the other Cullens much either.  I was actually enjoying the characters of Seth and Leah more than anyone else.  I felt like she poured more effort into writing those two.  After reading The Host, I was expecting so much more.  This book didn't read like a Meyer book for me and that disheartens me.
1401216676|4.0|There really isn't anything I an add that hasn't already been mentioned by other reviewer's: the comic looks great, the story is entertaining and provides (as far as I know) an unprecedented look into the origins of The Joker, and The Joker is just an awesome character in here.  It is a bit short (you can probably finish it off in less than an hour, though I spent quite a bit of time examining the artwork) and a bit cliche (Batman and The Joker are the same) but still very enjoyable.    Check it out, it's well worth the $10 and the hour it takes to read it.
031606792X|2.0|I can't exactly say that I hated this book. If it had been written as a part of a different series or somehow as a stand alone book, I may have really enjoyed it. However, very little about this book felt like the proper ending for the Twilight Saga.  For most of this book I honestly felt as though I were reading a piece of fanfiction...not exactly bad fanfiction, but fanfiction none the less.  Everyone seemed so out of character.  Nothing really flowed with the other books.<br /><br />:Spolier Ahead:<br /><br />I had no expectations on what this book would hold.  I had only started reading the series about 2 weeks before the release of this book, and I am not the sort of person to sit around and imagine different endings.  I WANTED a happily ever after for this book, but I was prepared for it not to be.  I was ready for there to have been some kind of pain in the end, but when I got the happily ever after it felt somehow wrong.  Everything was too perfect, too easy.  There was this big build up for Bella to have to make a sacrifice of some kind, but she didn't have to.  She got everything she ever wanted, dreamed of, and more. Normally this would make me happy.  This is how I like books to end, but somehow I didn't like the way she got there.
031606792X|2.0|Wow, I've been waiting for BREAKING DAWN to come out forever....and when it does....all I want to do is close the book.  Stephanie Meyer created a whole plot line in the last three books and completely destroys it with this 'novel.'   Pregnant? Pregnant?! I have read plenty of fanfiction and always skipped over the pregant bella stories just because it was so out there.   The ones I did read were way better than what Stephanie Meyer gave us.  Part One and Part Three were...umm. VERY disappointing.  It is almost as if the author had a few ideas but didn't know what to write. She lost connection with Bella as a character...big time and seemed like she had major writer's block.  And Nessie? The names are very uncreative. She combined Esme and Renee together....and I HATED how Jacob imprints on Bella's child. It is also not cool how we are introduced to the 'immortal children' concept.   I am an avid fan....but this was a poor bk, writing wise. My only fav. part was ironically the one in Jake's perspective.     This book seems like it's a first draft. Not a final copy.
031606792X|5.0|I've read all of the twilight books, but I never allowed any of them to become my life blood, like a lot of other people obviously have. I just read them, thought they were decent books, and moved on, so I went into Breaking Dawn with zero expectations and came out pleasantly surprised. It was a nice wrap up to a good story. The end!
031606792X|4.0|I was definately looking forward to this book, but I have to say it was certainly not what I expected - which is not a bad thing! *No Spoilers*<br /><br />The book is divided into three parts. Part One, is from Bella's perspective (as usual) and Part Two was from Jacobs. I'm not a big fan of Jacob's character, so I was a bit annoyed to read it; however, there was no other way for SM to write that section of the book, if it came from Bella's perspective, we the audience, in the story would have missed out on a lot of the plot. Granted there was a huge twist that was a little too Sci-Fi for me, but when you continue through to Part Three you will be rewarded!<br /><br />Part Three was from Bella's perspective again, and it was the section we have all be waiting for and SM did not disappoint. Not getting into spoilers and plot summaries - I thought I could try to shed some light on why there is such a divide in the reviews...<br /><br />The Twilight series has always focused on Bella and Edward (okay Jacob too). In Breaking Dawn, SM changed the focus, thus changed the dynamics in this book. Taking away a lot of romance and focus from Bella and Edward would have a lot of Twilighters upset. Also, because this book is suppose to be geared towards young readers, the occurances in this book go above what they are able to relate too. Bella is no longer someone they can identify with, as they had before -thus, this would upset a lot of them leaving them without the feeling of closure. These are just some of my thoughts on the diversity of the reviews (all over the net) regarding Breaking Dawn.<br /><br />I was weary reading Book Two, I was having my doubts, but it was redeemed in Book Three. Well done and I hope to read more from the Twilight characters - well except Jacob :P
031606792X|1.0|This book has no consistency. There characters are completely out of character and it violates the rules the author made herself for her tragically flawed universe. Everything is tied up an a sparkly bow. Is it that hard to add some reality and emotional depth by having SOMEONE without a happy ending?
031606792X|4.0|This is the 4th book in the Twilight Saga ... if you read them out of order, you'll be a little lost.<br /><br />Bella and Edward start off a few days away from their wedding.  Jacob, Bella's bff and werewolf, has ran away because of the news.  That's the worse it could get, that her best man is not at her wedding ... right?<br /><br />Hold on to that thought!  (Spoiler alert)<br /><br />Of course they will get married, early on like SM promised her readers.  However, please be ready for a drastic change from what you saw in the previous 3 books (Twilight, New Moon & Eclipse) because what you'll read here is not that YA anymore.  The happy couple gets married, have a wonderful honeymoon, and (to all her readers surprise!!!) get pregnant!  Yes ... then that is when the story in THIS book really starts.  They will have to fight to protect their lives from themselves, the fetus, and the Volturi.  I say again, this is for the older audience that knows what it is to take that next step after marriage and have a kid...(the younger audience is probably thinking along the lines of, wtf was SM thinking getting Bella pregnant with a vampire!?!)  it's an unknown world and that's what you'll find in BD.<br /><br />Bella and Edward are plunged very un-expectantly in to a very unfamiliar situation and have to rely on the support of their love, family, and friends to get through the next few months.  Their love is stronger now than ever.<br /><br />Jacob is once again there to rescue Bella, Edward, and the entire world it seems.  He really shines as a character, once again.<br /><br />Her parents are mentioned seldom.  Renee is only barely mentioned actually and her dad, just like with the engagement, is very understanding of all the choices Bella has made.<br /><br />The Cullens are portrayed as a very strong family in the vampire world.  They have many friends all around the world that are more than willing to help them, even jeopardizing their own lives to help however they can.<br /><br />The Vultori as still intimidating and have millennia's of power to precede them.<br /><br />My favorite continues to be Eclipse.  If you don't want the perfect story turned more upside than it was in New Moon, brace yourself.  It happens!!<br /><br />I gave this review 4 stars because I still love Edward and Bella and as an older reader of the Saga, see how SM could bring herself to write this book the way she did.  She's a happy wife and mother.  She made sure in Eclipse to include Rosalie's story of no kids and her desire to have had one to lead us all straight to this.  Some parts did seem different than SM's usual writing style.  The end was wrapped up rather quick and without much explanation.  Leaves a lot to your imagination I guess, and that's always fine with me.  I think she did setup a great stage for all the next characters to evolve and I hope to see more stories from different POV's.  Jacob's POV was fun, different.  Maybe we'll have more pack stories as well not just vampire ones.illennia's of power to precede them.    My favorite continues to be Eclipse.

031606792X|5.0|The first part of the book, until the honeymoon, was perfect, everything. I really loved the way Stephenie wrote the wedding and how Jacob appeared. The honeymoon is already a classic, the sea, the moon, the careful sex, and even the bruises and Edward feeling so bad about it, I really enjoyed this part. The in comes the surprise, I mean who expected this? NOT ME. I wasn't mad at Steph, I was concerned about the pregnancy, but I kept reading. I really don't understand that crap about the bad message. I don't think that Stephenie is telling: common, get pregnant at 18! That's cool! No, she is just giving Bella a chance to be a mother.    I must say that I loved Jacob's book. I understand perfectly why she picked Jacob's mind to narrate the whole pregnancy thing, and she did it well. I don't know if I would have enjoyed an oh-I-love- my-baby-and-everyone-is- mad-at-me-and- I-don't-care-dying- for-him time, it was way much interesting seeing the pack mind, Jacob's thoughts, how he sees Bella, how he loves her and how he refuses his own pain to see her happy, and I loved the conversations between Edward and Jacob's mind. For me, one of the best parts of the book was Jacob imprinting on Nessie (I don't like the name Renesmee, sorry), another twist that NO ONE expected. I was so happy for Jacob.    And then the vampire thing. I was so eager to see Bella as a vampire, I've always wanted it to be, I find it very interesting how she fits in, and how she didn't fit as a human, and that makes her more vampire than anyone, she knew, she chose and she chose right. The first time hunting, how she controls herself, the newborn skipped part. I loved when she met Nessie and when she realized so quickly that Jacob had imprimted on her. God, I was crying! So hilarious.    And then everything was perfect, their lives I mean. Edward and Bella become a sex beasts but the sex parts are ended so quickly, I didn't expect every detail but just a little more, though I understand that 10 yearolds were reading this. I expected something bad, that's what happens in every book, first everything is fine and suddenly BANG, twist. I was expecting the Volturi, of course, but I didn't see Alice leaving, I knew that she would come back but I couldn't imagine her plans.     I found it enjoyable, with all the new friends, Nessie touching them (how cute she is ^^) the gifts that people had and how Bella starts practicing with her shield. When the Volturis came I was so nervous, but for me that part was too long, the speeches, the debating, for me it was longer than it should be (in fact that's the only thing I didn't like) and though I expected a fight it was nice that there wasn't, I'm sure that at least one Cullen would have died. And in the nick of time Alice comes, I expected her, but I didn't see that one coming. The story of the half vampire. It was a neat way to end the doubts Aro held.    Everything is fine, everyone is fine, well Irina is dead but she had it coming. I always knew that it would be a happy ending, I didn't include a baby in the equation but it is an enjoyable twist for me. And another of the best moments in the book is when Bella lets Edward in her mind, I CRIED at this, and how Edward is stunned and how he kisses her. Perfect.     The book was perfect, an incredible finale to an incredible series. Stephenie did her best and I think that she really wanted US to be happy, that's why she tied everything so neatly. We all owe her a big THANK YOU and the best wishes for her.
031606792X|5.0|I thought the book was great. SM tied up most of the loose ends. And I'm glad she shared her story with me. Although, I'm sad to see the series end I will miss the characters of the book. I think a lot of people forgot that this is just a STORY and bashed the author pretty hard. And lets not forget it's her story no matter how you wanted it to end. That being said, I loved all of the Twilight and hope to read more of her stories in the future. If you haven't read Breaking Dawn I would definitely recommend it.
031606792X|5.0|Meyer did a phenomenal job ending the Twilight Saga. There couldn't possibly have been a better story to tie up all the loose ends. With the incorporation of magic (which was tastefully done) readers can smile with much contentment that the saga was ended appropriately.
0061537934|5.0|I love this book, it took me less than a weekend and a box of tissues to complete it.  I too purchased because I love books about Dogs.  This ended up to be one of my top picks for the year.<br /><br />I love it, Enzo an awesome pup, great story line.
0321344758|5.0|I read this book when I was still an amateur programmer. I since earned a university degree in computer science and am a professional web developer, and I still use the advice given in this book. User friendliness and value to the customer (which go hand in hand) are the most important lessons any programmer can learn.    This book has a (seemingly) intuitive thesis: web sites should be designed with the user in mind. More particularly, the harder one has to work to figure out how to use something, the worse it's designed; web site use should be obvious (or at least self-explanatory). I say \\"seemingly\\" intuitive because it ought to be intuitive but a lot of programmers, especially inexperienced ones, forget that.    While this book is geared towards entry-level people, it will serve as an important reminder to seasoned professionals of the basics of good design and user-friendliness. With that said, I think that new designers (who are most prone to poor usability design) and people who feel they have not been designing with the user in mind will benefit the most from reading this book, and much of the advice in this book will be useful even years later.
031606792X|4.0|The first part of the book felt \\"weird\\" to me - like the characters/writing were inconsistent - but halfway through it really picked up and I had a better sense of why some things had occurred.  By the end, I definitely liked it!
031606792X|5.0|This is a really good book, I have to say. I mean, I know that it's unrealtstic, it's a fantasy book. Vampires aren't realistic, now are they? Sure, a lot of this was predicted, but it delivered. Bella and Edward got married, at 19 and technically speaking, 17. It's a good book, it's a good fantasy book. Most readers should know the entire series is unrealistic, but I guess not. Apparantly nobody else read the other three knowing that vampires aren't real, nor are werewolves.

031606792X|2.0|This was very disappointing. Haven't even finshed the whole thing yet...kinda don't want to.<br /><br />*Spoilers.<br /><br />WHY THE HECK DID SHE GET PREGANT?!?!?!?<br />It's totaly unnesicary.<br />And FREAKY.<br />Edward and Bella don't have that \\"Oh my god they're so in love\\" thing for me anymore.<br />They have an effing baby.<br />And it ripped open her stomach...gross much!?!?!<br /><br />And all the sex...<br />I mean Bella, get a hold of yourself.<br />Yeah okay, the hormones sure...but we all thought you were different than that.<br />The book was really good until the instant Meyer said Bella was prego.<br />That soooo didn't fly.<br />I mean, it was even kinda okay then...but then it was like going into all that.<br />And I read that thing on her site that said baby = impossible between them. Like the body gets frozen so nothing comes in or out...wouldn't Edward notice if he was capable of fathering a child!!! I mean seriously.<br /><br />I think people should stop reading at Eclipse.<br />I thought the marriage thing was gonna be a disaster, but so far it's the most okay thing that has happened.<br />AND WHAT THE HELLLLLLLLLLL WITH JACOB IMPRINTING ON THE BABY!!! That's just sick and gross and eergggghhh. Disgusting.<br />Yuck.<br />That's so creepy and wrong. I don't know what the heck Meyer was thinking. This book is for a young audience too. I know like middle school kids who read this. And no, its not okay for them to read this book. It's just SICK.<br /><br />Take out the whole pregnancy thing and the book would be way better. Why couldn't Meyer go along with the original story line, hmm? I mean, it was about people being in love, making sacrifies, pure clean love. NOT SEX AND A MUTANT BABY.<br /><br />Well...I'm gonna go finish the thing and get creeped out more...
B0017MO10U|3.0|It wasn't as great as the ark of truth. But i believe its because you had a whole season to get into the story and this was pretty much a movie that could have been a two part episode. It is still utterly enjoyable. for fans who have been here since the first sg-1 episode you will enjoy having Jack back. Hes back and he's his witty self. Love the Ba'al and Jack banter its AWESOME. I think if you watched any of the behind the scenes stuff you'll be a little to expectant but if you haven't you may enjoy it more. For the big fans i def reccomend especially if you missed seening jack-goa'uld-daniel banter.

031606792X|2.0|To properly review this book, I have to go back to the first three . . .    Twilight - the beauty of Twilight was the beauty of first love, especially love that has so many challenges to overcome.  In Twilight Bella was a strong character - leaving home, starting at a new school, and trying to make sense of a first love with a very complicated \\"boy.\\"  Stephenie Meyer actually had me believing in the possibility of vampires, even though this is not my genre at all.  I honestly feel she should have stopped with Twilight; it is always better to leave your readers wondering, \\"Will she spend eternity with Edward, or not?\\" rather than proceed with the next three installments, which got progressively worse.  New Moon - I can't adequately express how much I disliked this book.  I understand why Edward left, but for Bella to curl up into a pathetic ball was truly sad.  All of us experience loss- whether it is a first love, or family, or health, but the message sent was it is okay to wallow in self-despair and lose yourself.  I also objected to the fact that she used Jacob (similar to the scene in Twilight where she \\"flirts\\" with him to gain information).  I don't particularly care for Jacob as a character, but the manner in which she used him for her selfish purposes once again shows a character of weak moral and intellectual value.  She loses interest in her academic side to pursue trouble in order to hear Edward's voice - great plan.  The Volturi are beyond description in terms of ridiculousness - any belief engendered in the reality of vampires was completely blown apart by their existence in the book.  Eclipse - Bella has made her choice - right?  Wrong!  She spends the bulk of this terrible book alternately pining for Jacob or trying to get Edward to have sex with her.  She sneers at marriage, yet tries to get him to turn her into a vampire for all eternity.  Jacob is truly a reprehensible character in this book.  I personally do not find emotional manipulation sexy, and lost tons of respect for Bella and Jacob as she waffled between the two men, and he used any method he could to sway her.  Any strength or dignity she had in the first novel completely disappears.  Which leads us to . . .  Breaking Dawn - Bella goes through with marriage for the right reasons?  No, mostly to have sex with Edward.  I fear that most people (sadly myself included) read this book simply for the sex scenes that Meyer has been leading up to since Twilight.  Rather voyeuristic, and weird. The whole \\"Jacob's perspective\\" is ridiculous, and quite frankly confusing.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Excellent film for acting, entertainment, and history.  Recommend highly to anyone interested in early history of USA.
031606792X|4.0|To start off with, this book was not what I was expecting but I'm not about to be overly critical to the close-minded who are bashing this book from every angle. This book was well written in many ways, there some spots with humor and from Chapter 24 on I couldn't put it down. If you are open-minded to take the awkward and surprising moments in stride and look at the context around them I'm sure you would agree it is a decent book. Yes, I will admit that some of the concepts are seen as horrible but you have to look at the things around it.     1st Point: Pregnancy and marriage at 18.   - Yes, this book makes the two seem like something every teenager should do. But the sad and honest truth is that pregnancy is common place among teenagers today so I don't know why it's so shocking to see it in a book. For me, I don't agree with it but I'm not about to freak out over it appearing in a book.     2nd Point: Renesmee \\"Nessie\\"      - Ok, alot of people of seething over this choice of name. If you read far enough you will see that Bella is not fond of the name Nessie either. You all are treating it like her full name is: Nessie. Her real name is Renesmee. People are attacking this as well. I think its creative that SM choose Renesmee for a first name and Carlie for the middle name. It works the same with fathers naming their sons: Frank Sr and Frank Jr. What is the big deal?     3rd Point: Jacob imprinting on a baby      - I can understand the freak outs over this but there is no need to be making comments that he is a pedophile, he's not and SM doesn't portray him that way. He even states, when Bella is pissed of at him when she finds out. He says I quote: \\"It was involuntary\\" He didn't choose it and you'll also note when Rosalie is holding Renesmee BEFORE the imprinting he wants to kill it. Later on in the chapter he also says \\"You know I don't think of her that way! Do you think Edward would have let me live this long if I did? All I want is for her to be safe and happy--is that so bad? So different from what you want?\\" This whole issue is just plain over-reaction.     4th Point: Edward asking Jacob to sleep with her      - At first glance this is shocking but think about it in context. Bella is dying. Edward ONLY says this out of desperation. She wants a baby, and you will all be surprised when it happens to you how even if you didn't want to have a baby how you become attached to it while you are carrying, like Bella. SM has 3 children she is more than qualified to know the bond between mother and child. Honestly, how many you can sit there and say that you when it came down to it that if someone you loved deeply were dying and there was any possible way, no matter how ridiculous and unfathomable it was that the loved one could be saved that you wouldn't try that one thing no matter what it was? When it comes to people we love deeply we would be willing to try anything to keep them safe and/or save their life. You would feel regret afterwards for not trying that one thing if it were possible. Edward was trying to save her. And as for the way he was acting throughout, put yourself in his shoes, wouldn't you react the same way if you had to watch your loved one die right in front of your eyes and being unable to save them?     5th Point: Bella becoming a vampire     - That has been what she has wanted since the very beginning. SM is giving her what she wants. In mythology in our own world vampires are portrayed as strong and unbeatable. If you think about it, iff SM would have kept Bella's clumsy side we would all be like, why? It wouldn't make sense in all SM's descriptions of vampires in Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse to keep Bella clumsy. And again, BELLA WANTS TO BE A VAMPIRE. As for her choice to attend at least one semester of college, she's human. Our wants change alot, its not unheard of.    6th Point:      - If you think about it, many people out there like Science Fiction novels, movies, and tv shows. If Breaking Dawnwas never made into a book and it made into a movie instead, NOONE would be complaing.    Finally, everyone is making the book out to be a mockery and making jokes about its content. I think it was a well-written, extremely creative book altogether. From Chapter 24 to the end was honestly my favorite part because of the covens coming together and the whole Volturi issue. That's good writing. I challenge each and everyone out there criticizing this book, to sit down and try to be as creative as SM. I'm a writer myself, an amateur at best, but still a writer. Believe me I've tried to be as creative as SM but to no avail. The way she took concepts from her other books and expanded on them in Breaking Dawn and kepping the flow going fairly smooth and tying everything together was very well done.     I think everyone needs to calm down and just look at the book in a different light. Yes, I understand that every book as its critics and people who hate the book, its very obvious in this case, but an open mind will take the good with the bad and make an honest opinion. I think the whole issue mostly is just the SURPRISE that this book brought. I don't think any of us were expecting the content. As for the people saying she was just cramming everything into a final book, SM actually said that it is the final book, BUT it is the final book from Bella's POV, she said there might be more but written in someone elses POV. If that is what she was thinking she wouldn't be cramming all this into one book. If you think about it, she is pleasing what I think many of us were expecting or wanting in the end: Bella and Edward together, Bella becoming a vampire (which may I add that SM was leading up to in New Moon where Aros was curious what her ability would be once a vampire because she was able to block him), and Jacob ending up happy. Everything SM said came true, obviously not the way that many hoped but she still did it. I applaud her work on this piece and wait anxiously for other publications from her.

031606792X|1.0|I thought coming into Breaking Dawn without any expectations would guarantee me no disappointment, but I was wrong.    For a book that was supposed to be centered around Edward and Bella, we didn't get to see very much of their relationship besides the first couple chapters, which was really the only part of the book that actually felt like something that was a part of the series. Suddenly, Bella is magically impregnated (aren't *all* of Edward's... ahem, bodily fluids... supposed to be replaced with venom?) and the characters completely lose their spunk.    In an attempt to keep everyone happy, Stephenie Meyer has left a lot of faithful fans confused and in denial.
031606792X|5.0|This book literaly took me on a emotional rollercoaster and I loved the happily ever after ending.
031606792X|5.0|It was the most wonderful book i've read in a long time prolly since Harry Potter. The book made me cry and laugh and tense and me wanting more. Others say they don't like Bella having a child,becoming immortal, Jacob actually being happy for once. Why not? They all deserve it. We had jealousy, a war, love and everything else thats in the pot of emotions. Now she gave us a happy ending. IT was great. I applaude her tramendously. If you haven't read it yet, read it, make your own decision. I'll prolly read it again because no other books can compare to Edward and Bella's love.
B00006IR5S|5.0|My son loves the Book, Movies and now the soundtrack.  Great Gift for Potter Lovers !
031606792X|1.0|One of the most horrendous books I have ever had the misfortune to read. I feel like crying because I am so disappointed the books ended this way. I, like many others, will consider Eclipse to be the last book in the series.    Thanks for nothing, Stephenie Meyer.
031606792X|1.0|I don't even know how to begin to think about reviewing this book. It is by-far the most horrible literature I have ever read. Whoever thought it was a good idea to publish this piece of poo needs to be severely reprimanded. PARENTS- DO NOT LET YOUR CHILDREN READ THIS BOOK. It is in no way appropriate for anyone, ever. The world does not need to read about a vampire having sex with a teenage girl and impregnating her with an evil vampire hybrid baby that enjoys eating its mothers insides. If you were stupid enough to buy this book, please, do the world a favor and return it. We need to send the message that Stephanie Meyer should never write again.
B0018QCXGY|1.0|I'm not sure what was worse, the camera hooked up to a paint-can-shaker or the chararcters. (Be sure to take your dramamine before watching this FILM). And please, enough with these insipid \\"Blair Witch wanna be films\\"--they are unwatchable ok?  The only good thing about this method was that it detracted from the plot.  Although the plot did have some initial interest, but only with respect to the aliens. The set-up was too long & I totally disliked all the vapid, no-redeeming value characters, which were so awful that I actually found myself rooting for the aliens, hoping none of them survived--I only wish the whinner was killed a lot sooner!!!  An ending would also have been nice, even though, it really didn't matter that much to me by then, (certainly there was enough time, given how short this film was). I was constantly looking at my watch wondering when this mess would finally be over--at which time my wife & I just looked at each and couldn't help but laugh at how dreadful a movie this was.  Oh, and it was her idea to watch this, so she owes me next time I want to watch The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy again for the 10th time--and yes I'm being factious.  How this movie rated 3-stars is incomprehensible to me, it's no better than 1-star.
031606792X|5.0|Loved Breaking Dawn! It was a perfect ending. All of the pieces came together as they should in this ficticious world. Edward and Bella together forever. Loved it!
0143038419|5.0|I think it's all been said about this book but I wanted to add how much I enjoyed & loved it and how much I felt like I was losing a friend when I finished the book!
031606792X|4.0|I read to many books with unhappy endings, a twist in the end, a flip-side to the whole story. Breaking Dawn gave me a comforting closure to the story of Bella, Edward and Jacob. As a mother of 5, I don't believe this book was written with the pre-teen/teen mind set. I felt this book was more of a fiction novel written for adults who want an enjoyable adventure to another world, another life, to be able to dream of excitement, love, romance, trials and contention. SM did an excellent job in writing her story. She took me on a journey I will never forget and will read over and over again.
B000002OCP|2.0|Muddy is always great but this CD is a little sad. I bought it when it first came out and it was disappionting then. I think it an attempt to cash in on white performers sucess with \\"electric\\" versions of classic blues tunes. The fuzz-tone guitars are just out of place with Muddy's robust blues voice. It has some historical value given the unique nature of the collaboration but other than that forget it. For the real thing get \\"Mississippi Muddy Waters\\" a great live album with Pinetop Perkins and Johnny Winter. It's 100 proof.
031606792X|1.0|I don't know exactly what went wrong. It was always so effortless to accept the unbreakable bound between Bella & Edward as an absolute truth. So easy to love Jacob for all the reasons Bella does. The whole vampire/werewolf thing was an accepted part of that reality and Bella's openess to that world made even the most fantasical elements in previous volumes very real and very exciting. But in Breaking Dawn something was missing and I was constantly distracted by how disgusting and creepy the whole situation was. I waited for Ms. Meyer to redeem her characters, but I remain baffled. I think Ms. Meyer was so busy writing \\"The Host\\" (which is full of all the things I love about her writing) that she decided to  let one of her cracked out groupies have a shot at writing a book. I don't know what I was expecting, but that wasn't it.
031606792X|1.0|I was so excited for this book!  I went to the midnight party, I stayed up all night reading and read all the next day.  I closed the book so disappointed. . . The characters I fell in love with in the first three books were not there.  What happended?
031606792X|1.0|I've been anticipating such a disaster since I heard the supposed spoilers, but not really believing it would happen. The other three books were so good, it would take a train wreck of titanic proportions to ruin it. Alas, the rumors were true. A smashingly awful end to an otherwise enjoyable series. And now to the important part: why Breaking Dawn was such a colossal mess.    DISCLAIMER: Extensively long and ranting review to follow.    *SPOILERS*    1. There was actually no plot. More so the illusion of a plot. I can summarize the book thusly and save you some money:    Book 1, Bella - Has a wedding. Looks hot as usual but fails to grasp the extent of her gorgeousness. Has a gooey honeymoon, complete with destroyed headboards and feathers. Fails to use protection for (obvious?) reasons and lo and behold becomes pregnant with beloved Edward's demon spawn. Becomes a maniacal mother off a Lifetime movie.    Book 2, Jacob - Sees Bella's wedding. Is jealous/miserable/annoyed/angry. Find her pregnant upon her return from her honeymoon. Is jealous/miserable/annoyed/angry. Howls a lot. Eventually gets the hots for the newborn little beast instead. Is suddenly all buddy buddy with beloved Edward.    Book 3, Bella - Is a crazy mother. Becomes a vampire. Marvels at how damn awesome she is, now that her true mediocrity is hidden by her \\"rocking bod\\". Has a lot of sex. Worries over the hybrid a lot. Prepares to fight, but finds that no fighting is necessary. Has a lot of sex. The End.    2. Edward and Bella have a child. Besides the fact that the ENTIRE book revolves around this fact, besides the fact that the entire atmosphere created by the previous three books is shattered with it, besides the fact that Bella loses any shred of personality she once had after \\"motherhood\\", and besides the fact that she seems possessed by the honor of carrying beloved Edward's mini-me and nothing else, it simply makes no sense. I've toyed with every possible explanation suggested, and none ofthem are satisfying. Frankly, I feel a tad insulted that readers are just supposed to swallow whatever an author puts out there, simply because it is \\"fantasy\\". We deserve a world where things fit together, and Bella's pregnancy fits in nowhere.     3. Renesmee Carlie is a dreadful name. There, I said it.    4. Rosalie is little too \\"Hand that Rocks the Cradle\\" for my taste. What ever happened to the compassion she suddenly revealed in Eclipse? She's gone psycho. As opposed to the other members of the Cullen family, who are mere shadows and bad impressions of the characters they used to be. (Jazz?? really?)    5. Leah apparently has a big role to play in this book. Oh wait, never mind, she doesn't.    6. Hey guys, look, a big climactic fight scene! Oh wait, never mind, just more poorly written vampire lovin' that is completely contradictory to the way things were initially portrayed.    7. Bella is even more of a jerk as a vampire than she was as a human. Now she finally knows she's hot, wants to crush things all the time, and is a bit of a show off. But at least she's as dull as she always was.    8. The whole \\"What Do I Tell My Parent's Problem\\" is nonexistent. Renee seems content with a phone call from her daughter every couple of years or so. And Charlie seems pretty cool with his daughter becoming a bloodsucking monster so long as he has a new fishing set to play around with.    9. Come to think of it, NONE of the potential issues that were mentioned in previous books seem to become real problems. Is Bella a crazed bloodthirsty wild newborn? Nope, she breezes through it. Are her parents devastated by the loss of their daughter? Nope, they barely care. Does Edward find her any less attractive? Hahahahahaha *chuckles*. Is any human sensation or desire lost after becoming a vampire? Figures that they would be even better. There were literally NO sacrifices Bella had to make to be with her soul mate. Everything just miraculously fell into place, flawlessly, and with no effort whatsoever. Talk about luck.    10. Jacob imprinting on Nessie is too convenient and goes against how Jacob was represented. He fell in love with Bella the human way and is against imprinting as it takes away yet another of his choices. Wouldn't it make sense for him to be the only one who gets to CHOOSE who he loves? I'm sorry, but this plot twist was one of the most unappreciated of all for me.    11. Jacob is not immortal. He can slow his aging to let his imprint catch up, but he will grow old and die eventually. But will Nessie? And at what age will she stop growing? When she is Jacob's age? What will happen then? Will they both stay frozen, so that Jacob can watch the rest of his family age and have children and die off?    I like happy endings. I don't mind that Jacob imprinted on a baby. I was glad Bella finally became a vampire. I didn't find the birth scene unbearably gruesome. The only problem I had was the lack of intensity and passion, personality in the characters, and the total absence of substantial and logical (yes even fantasy books have to have rules) plot. As a stand alone book, it's so-so, but it is simply ridiculously out of place amongst its predecessors. I hardly even cared what happened to anyone. I will not bash SM, I will merely mourn the feeling I had when getting lost in the previous books, because it was crushed with the coming of Breaking Dawn.    Finally, for those of you who think I am taking this way too seriously for a YA vampire novel, I forked over $16 for 768 pages of unnecessary tree death, and when this is the outcome, I think I have the right to be chagrined.    Ah well. If you are a disgruntled ex-fan like me, you can still console yourself with this truth - no matter how bad your life gets, Bella's will always be better.

031606792X|2.0|To avoid writing what I have been reading over and over again I will just say it's a disappointment. I sat there after reading the book wondering what had just happened. It was not only out of place, but just plain bad.
031606792X|3.0|Well...I must say this is one of the strangest finales I have ever read. I am a die-hard Twilight fan; I waited in line at my local bookstore at midnight to get my book then raced home to read it. All the while I was reading, I was not only utterly confused but I was wondering what had happened while she wrote the book. Stephenie Meyer told us readers that this was the ending she had pictured for Edward and Bella since she began the series, but I ,on the other hand, most definitely did not expect this. They have their wonderful little wedding and they are happy and blissful on \\"Isle Esme\\" and that was no surprise, but then Ms. Meyer ripped away all the passion and love out of their wedding night for us. That was something I was most looking forward to: a short intimate scene about their first time. Edward and Bella's relationship was always defined by those little moments that made our hearts race, and made us wish we were in Bella's shoes but there was a heartbreaking absence of these scenes in Breaking Dawn. Instead, all we see is right before and right after.   I can't even begin to talk about Bella's pregnancy. We see WAY before Bella does that she is pregnant, but while I was reading I was thinking \\"No way, this can't happen. There is no way that a vampire can get anyone pregnant.\\" But, apparently there is. This was just weird, and it was inconsistent with the author's own words(she said that vampires had no bodily fluids so therefore there would be no sperm). I suffered through reading Jacob's point of view, watching Bella be killed by the thing inside her and I was utterly disgusted by the delivery. I also thought that that was a very strange place to switch points of view again. Then she names the baby girl \\"Renesmee\\".I read the name three times and still thought that I hadn't gotten it right, I thought \\"there's no way she would ever name a child something like Renesmee.\\"I was yet again wrong. So the pregnancy thing just really threw me and ticked me off. Ireally thought it was unnecessary and a stupid thing to add to the story.    Now, Bella as a newborn was probably the best thing because it gave most readers what they wanted, Bella changed, and Meyer did a very nice job describing the process with excellent word choice and imagery. But when she woke to find that Jacob had imprinted on the baby, that just seemed wrong. How do you explain that to someone you are destined to be with? \\"Yeah, well, I was totally and utterly in love with your mom and often fantasized about her. We were going to kill you by ripping you out of your mother but instead you were born. So now I'm settling with you...\\"THAT would be one awkward conversation.   The conflict with the Volturi was what we were all expecting, but it was pretty pointless. NOTHING happened, they came, they talked, they left. End of story. Alice saw it coming but then she ditches the whole family with Jasper. It was very entertaining to read about all the vampires that are their friends but I was horribly disappointed to see that Meyer virtually removed Alice from the story from pages 200 to 650. She couldn't see the baby so she locked herself in a closet all the time. Alice was always one of my favorite characters and her disappearance from the story really made me sad.   All in all, I believe that Stephenie Meyer is a wonderful writer and story teller and I LOVED the first three installments of the series but I believe that she really let herself and all her fans down with this one. I understand that she wanted to leave no loose ends, and to tie everything up nicely, but she did not have to go about it in the fashion that she did. The \\"bow\\" that she tied around the story to bring it all together was totally unrealistic and broke the connection that most of us readers had with the story by tying every one of there stories into the same one. There were so many things she could have done to end the story for all of them and answer all of our questions but she did not doit in an entertaining way. I also thought that the character development that had taken place in the first three novels was absent in this one and made the story much less interesting. So, even if you LOVE Stephenie Meyer or the Twilight Saga, I honestly would not recommend this finale to you.
031606792X|4.0|POSSIBLE SPOILER!!    I personally enjoyed the book very much. It definitly was not what I expected. Iam a true romantic at heart so I was happy that Bella and Edward had a great love story. Why is it so wrong to end with a great love story? I know we try to analyze everything but why cant it just be a great love story with a happy ending. Why do we need something bad to happen and ruin a true love?    I also thought that it was a little crazy for a teenager to get married and have a child but at least she was married when she made love with edward and when she had the baby. It could have been worse. Plus, who doesnt have a huge sexual appetite at age 18 so, I  definitly was not surprised by Bella's actions towards Edward.     Jake on the other hand had irritated me from the beginning bc he was a such a whiner. PLus, I totally saw this coming that he would imprint on Bella's child. So there was no shock there. I am totally Team Edward all the way!!     Overall, It was a good book and I enjoyed reading it.
031606792X|2.0|I like millions of others was captivated by this series. I fell in love, I obsessed, I waited in line for 3 hours at a midnight book party. I never thought Breaking Dawn would break my heart, but it did. Only the first three chapters rang true to the series and our beloved characters. I will not spoil, because I still believe in keeping the integrity of this or any long awaited book, however I feel as if Stephenie Meyer spent way too much time pulling ideas from fan fiction sights. Very little of it felt from her heart and touched my emotions like the previous three books did. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad story but I would have had a much better time swallowing it if it would have been a stand alone novel with all new characters. It just wasn't the story that should have ended this beloved series and I don't know if I'll ever be able to enjoy The Twilight Series again.
B0017MO10U|3.0|Enjoy this for what it is, a longer, extended episode. It has a lot of flaws, but it also has some of the magic of the old SG-1 stories, if not all too familiar. If you don't really care about collecting the movies or anything, I recomment renting or borrowing from a friend rather than buying this for 20 dollars.
031606792X|4.0|I will first let it be known that I am an avid fan.  Addicted would be putting it lightly, and after reading this book and its finality I am free of its magic hold on me.  I can return from my mind candy and on with me life.  But what bliss it has been!  I am thankful for the events of this book, SM has wrote an adult fairytale.  Which brings me to my point. Why are you all condemning her for it?  I understand this book has been embraced by the \\"young adult\\" section but SM never wrote the books with that audience in mind.  So i don't understand how you point socially unjust labels at her?  \\"Give a message about teen pregnancy to our youth?\\" Give me a break, did Anne Rice get this kind of crap?  How about Superman? Can people just take it for what it is? A great fantasy series that whisks you away?  People please take a deep breath and stop being so cynically critical of all that should be taken at face value.  Relax and enjoy.
031606792X|4.0|The title is self explanatory but after just finishing the book and reading a few reviews I think there is a lot people are missing.   BD is VERY different from the other three books.  I think when SM said she wasnt originally writing to a teen audience most people ignored it, but BD is where you really see that.  BD is a MUCH darker book that the others and almost edges on the border of \\"the real world\\" with its levels of sadness and despair.      All the characters in this book grow-up if you will.  Life becomes more serious and stressed for the grand part of the book and the characters are made to adjust.  There are plot twists and turns you wouldnt have guessed but I think to a degree thats a part of the book's appeal.    To confront the most commonly seen issues people had (SPOILER ALERT)  Bella Staying Human for Sex- Really? Was this hard to see? Young newlyweds+ honeymoon+ man of your dreams - the fact that you dont think you'll feel everything your feeling now, with this person again for YEARS= desire to maintain euphoric feeling. Not that hard to figure out    Baby Nessie- What I saw was unsafe sex gave you babies.- Granted in this case no one has ever heard of vampires having children but the logic is actually sound if you think about human procreation.  The term \\"my biological clock is ticking\\" only applies to females.- Then to apply normal rules to the darker nature of BD, sex with a vampire produces a baby much worst than any other.  The name was terrible though Ill concede to that.     Jake and Nessie- This isnt pedophilia.  In imprinting you are whatever that person needs you to be. So Jacob isnt going around thinking inappropriate thoughts about the child all day. It comes up a lot in the book simply because Edward and Bella know that when the time comes he'll be her perfect man due too this relationship and that bothers them because, like most protective parents, they cant see their little girl with anyone. Till then he's just the babysitter, big brother, best friend, etc.. It is an odd plot twist though.      Point is that the book really isn't bad if you can stretch the edges of the fairytale and see the darkness of reality in your utopia.
031606792X|4.0|i have written a much longer review earlier. i just wanted to say that whie the book has his flaws, it made me run oaround the house yellling oh my gosh!!!! joyfully. and that was only the first half.
031606792X|5.0|Its fiction! Get over it people! It was a blast to read. Me and my husband read the ending and although a bit cheesy we loved. As a mother of a 2 year old going through pregnancy I can relate. I think the teens can't. This book is fiction and was suspenseful and a page turner. Her books aren't great literature but she is a great story teller. So sorry to the people who are so sad. I hope you can find more joy in your narrow lives.
078401213X|5.0|You need to see this.  Period.    Pi is a gritty film with perfect pacing and an inventive story line.  Enough folks here have discussed their interpretation and relevance of the film.  See for yourself.
031606792X|1.0|The plot twists were predictable and contrived.  The characters I'd come to love disappeared in the last two thirds to be replaced by robots.  My Twilight \\"obsession\\" is officially over.
031606792X|5.0|Breaking Dawn was very different from the first three in the series which is why I think this book has gotten such harsh reviews. some of the things about the book are...    a) The first and probably most obvious reason of why it's so different was because it dealt with much more mature issues then the first three books did, but I think this is only to be expected. The series grew as Bella grew mentally and emotionally so it was completely understandable for the series to change like this when Bella was also so drastically changing.     b) I was a little doubtful about the book towards the beginning once Bella had found out she was pregnant. I know many people did not like this because Meyer had established at the beginning of the series that vampires could not conceive, but I think the way she wrote it and handled it made it work.     c) Bella seemed to get everything at the end of the book which a lot of people found unrealistic and ridiculous but Bella has throughout the series gone through quite a lot of pain both mentally and physically. She did not know that everything would turn out ok and she had to make many hard decisions in the process. The happy ending was just Meyer's way of tying up loose ends on a happy note.      d) Renesmee was a very controversial character and Jacob imprinting on her made it even worse. I did have problems with that character but towards the end I did begin to like her. Jacob imprinting on her was not sick or wrong and in a way it had to happen. Jacob was in love with Bella but he never imprinted on her, so instead he imprinted on her daughter, her own flesh and blood, a part of her. It made sense at least to me. It would not have seemed right for Jacob to imprint suddenly on some stranger; he was too much in love with Bella for that to have seemed right. Instead he imprinted on a part of Bella. He was in love with Bella because of that small part (Renesmee) and once Renesmee was no longer a part of Bella Jacob was no longer in love with her. I don't know if that was the way Meyer intended it but that's how I saw it.    All in all I really thought Breaking Dawn was an amazing book, but it was very different. Many people were expecting a book on the lines of Twilight New Moon and Eclipse but that was impossible. There were too many different aspects in Breaking Dawn that hadn't existed in the first 3 books for Breaking Dawn to be similar to them. Meyer needed to give Breaking Dawn a twist so that the books didn't start to sound repetitive so she did. I refuse to compare this book to any of the first three because it is such a different book and there for I can't really compare it. I liked Breaking Dawn because it was Breaking Dawn and to me Meyer is still an amazing writer.
1577314808|1.0|People will read into Tolle's gibberish whatever they want to hear.  They will fool themselves into believing that his \\"teaching\\" is something new and critical.  Yet, it's nothing more than the oldest lie in the Book.    You can be god.  You can control your reality.  You....  You....  YOU!    Sorry, but that it isn't true.
0930289234|5.0|Watchmen may get overlook in terms of literature due to perception of view of being a comic book but it's so much more than that. Watchmen deals with touchy subjects such as political science, history, philosophy, psychology, and so much more. The characters are so deep and structured it's tough to put the book down. No other comic book has such developed lives of characters in only 12 issues.
B000HEVZ6W|5.0|I agree with the other reviewer, \\"I never saved anything for the swim back!\\" is the answer to Brave New World, by Aldous Huxley, or to a genetic-manipulated world that we are now making. I own the DVD version, and now the blu-ray version. The 1080p detail is astonishing! Every time with my wife, we watched the movie and discussed, finding new underlining meaning, and we also find a new explanation to our life and society, and what our kids have to become.
031606792X|5.0|*Contains some spoliers*    I thought that this book was a very good ending to the saga. I have read the other three books in the saga and I am satisfied with the way things ended. I am not sure why people are upset that Bella and Edward ended up together. You are a fool to think they wouldn't. The whole series was surrounded around the two of them and their love for one another. Although, this book was not as action packed as the others, it was in it's own way. I found this book to be suspenseful and I could not stop reading it. I am not upset with the fact that Bella and Edward had a baby. Just like Bella, I am eighteen and though I could not imagine having a child at this time in my life, it would being I would want to do later on in life. Bella did not have that choice. She was going to be come a vampire before she was of what society sees as a normal birthing age. Regardless, I thought that it made complete sense for her to have a child. And some people are very distraught about the fact that Jacob imprinted on Nessie. I thought that would happen as soon as she found out she was pregnant. I assumed if it was a girl he would imprint, but I was not completely sure because Bella thought it was a boy. Jacob was always in love with Bella so it seemed fitting that the moment he saw Nessie he would imprint. Overall I thought the book was very well written. I throughly enjoyed it and although it was not the ending I had thought of, I am completely happy with the ways things have ended for Bella and Edward.
031606792X|5.0|This was my wife and I's favorite one of all of them. It was very well written. I did not like the ending it seemed that she just forced the end. like she had more story to tell in a next book but knew she needed to stop so she does not end up like J K Rowling just writing twilight books. Oh well I guess I'm still looking foward to Midnight Sun even though I already know what happens.
031606792X|5.0|I think this book only shows what happens after all that \\"happily ever after\\" thing, what usually doesn´t happen. People fall in love, and at the beggining everything is mysterious, and romantic, and so on... but then, what?   Then comes the life after marriage. When people want to have sex without always having to be romantic, or misterious. That´s called desire.  There´s also the routine. You get used to the one you´re married to.  And then, one day, suddenly you wake up and you want desperatly to have a baby. Because you realize that the one you have at your side is the one you love, and that it would be wonderful to have a kid with him/her, to create a new life that is a result of your love.  So, about this baby stuff, I think that Breaking Dawn is SO romantic, but in a more adult way. Is... mature.  Did you really think that Edward would have the courage to kill Bella without having to? Of course not. Something would have to kill her, and then he would be forced to finish the job. So, could it be more beautiful than this? Than giving these two people that love each other so much the chance to have a hole, complete love? Than giving Edward (because Bella and all that EJ crap, oooh girl) this gift, in return for all the effort, all the love, the patience this boy had with this girl? Why cannot a character be happy? Why is it a bad example for children? Can´t the children have hope? Can´t life give them something they never expected that could happen? In MY books this can happen, and I was totally happy it did. Just as I was when Beast turned into Prince Charming, even after the \\"he lost all hope, for who could ever learn to love a Beast\\" thing.   I´ve read about this book giving child a bad example. I think this isn´t a book about two teenagers meeting first love. Twilight was. This is a book that shows what happens after marriage. What happened after Snow White married the prince? Yeah, they had a lot of sex, and one day they decided they wanted babies.The same happened to Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast and so on. And it was also clear that Bella would attempt to college, but only after she learned to control herself and her eyes were not black anymore. How many times did Edward graduate on medicine school? Oh yes, three. Why? Not because he needed to, or that he needed the money, or anything like that. But because, in THIS story, they are rich enough to not worry about money, but they have to pretend. Is a sto-ryy..  \\"On, but a vampire cannot have children\\". Come on, vampires do not exist!! This is a BOOK, an universe totally new that exists inside Stephenie´s head, and that she shares with us!! Thanks, Steph.   About Bella´s power... it´s SO herself, being finally able to protect the ones she loves. That´s the most important thing for her, since she was a human... isn´t this the way the whole \\"vampires power\\" stuff works?Finally, about Jacob imprinting on baby-monster, oops, Nessie... his life was already about Bella. Imagine how boring would it be, \\"Hey Bells, I loved you so much but now I imprinted on this red-haired girl that I met around the corner\\". Is strange, but yet, this imprinting thing is totally strange, and it was also previously explained. Yes, you can imprint on a baby. No, imprinting is not the same as falling in love.. it´s so beautiful the description in the book: the balloons that represented everything about his own self going away... his life was she now. He hadn´t imprint on Bella, and this meant he could imprint on anyone around the world. And yet, he imprinted on Bella´s daughter, and I think this is full of meaning, of symbolism.  This is just my opinion. I enjoyed the book very much. I don´t think that this is about the same kind of love Twilight was. So, get over it and enjoy this new perspective.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Don't have HBO and relatives wanted us to see this series. So good I read the biography.
031606792X|4.0|I know some of you hate this book, but I liked it! not as much as the other three, but I still thought it was great. It did tick me off that we were told from the start that vamps can't reproduce, then she went and made Bella prgnant. Other than that, I immensly enjoyed the book. Stephenie is a great writer, and I can't wait for more from her. I'm still obsessed with the series, and it's over.......
031606792X|5.0|Like the endings of other fantasy sagas, I expected a happy ending.  We saw it to a greater or lesser degree in Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Dune, The Dark Materials and others.      I wondered often, while I watched the countdown to Breaking Dawn's release, what Stephenie would do with the characters and the story.  I foresaw the basics - Bella would become a vampire, she would choose Edward, they would marry, we would learn her gift as a vampire, and something would occur with Jacob that would make all the characters okay with each other.  Happily Ever After.    But I truly didn't expect the extent of twists and turns that took place in Breaking Dawn.  It was far more supernatural and far more emotional than I had expected.  What is most odd about this is that I should have learned from the previous two books because the events in them were completely unexpected for me as well.  It took me a bit to accept the events of New Moon especially.  But the wonderful ones - the trip to Italy and the ultimate return - kept my love for the story alive.  It was when, however, I really started to know and understand the characters of these books that I let go of what I wanted and needed and learned to really just enjoy their story.      This is why I loved Breaking Dawn.  The story went in a direction I did not expect.  And I loved Stephenie more for it.  It would be a bit silly, I think, to be upset by the supernatural and unbelievable aspects of it.  After all, her vampires sparkle.  I love that she had the guts to take this elsewhere and create new story lines and new things to contemplate.  I checked my logic at the door when I really got into Twilight, so why would it suddenly come back in for Breaking Dawn?    I have now read the story twice - I couldn't help it.  I found so many scenes unbelievably touching and I wanted to experience them again.  I completely understood Bella's instincts on motherhood as well as Edward's and Jacob's reaction to what was happening to her.  I hated leaving Bella's perspective for any period of time, but I found I really loved seeing Edward from new eyes.  And I knew, especially the second time through, that we needed that other viewpoint to really understand what happens to Bella and Jacob at that point in the story.  It was necessary.    I actually love the characters more now than I ever did before which is impressive as I was a huge fan from the beginning.  I reveled in Bella's excitement in the last part of the book.  It left me smiling and sighing along with her.      I am very happy with the end of this story.  I can tell that Stephenie has set up something more for Jacob and Ness.  And I love that.  I'm looking forward to more.
031606792X|5.0|I would like to thank Stephenie Meyer for creating a wonderful series and ending it with humor and emotion in Breaking Dawn.  Everything that I wanted to happen, happened and I must say that since this is fiction, I wasn't expecting it to be like real life, so I wasn't disappointed at all.  Bella was not out of character when you consider that she was two years older than when the series started and she was married.  That is a huge life style change.<br /><br />The only negatives were that I felt Leah Clearwater's little story wasn't wrapped up well enough and the name Renesmee is puke inducing.  Otherwise, I loved all of the characters.  I loved the fluff.  I loved the fact that the Volturi's non-demise means that she really might write another book in the future (though not from Bella's perspective).<br /><br />I laughed.  I cried.  I laughed some more.  I was entertained.  A supremely enjoyable read.
031606792X|1.0|Some people can overlook the flaws because the work is a piece of fiction. Yes, fiction is about lying, but to be a good liar you have a sense of continuity. Anything that tosses the reader's out of the reality you create isn't good. If you have to strain to believe what the narrator is telling you, if you have to turn off your critical functions instead of having the work engage them, when you sit there wondering what the writer was thinking (imprinting on an infant?), then the book has failed.

031606792X|3.0|The Twilight series is sort of like a guilty pleasure for me. It took a great deal of effort for me to close my lit mind and read the first one without zeroing in on issues, but once I managed to, I read New Moon and Eclipse right after for the sake of the romance.<br /><br />-SPOILERS-<br /><br />I read a lot of the reviews for BD and my opinion relatively coincides. I think where we differ... I didn't find Jacob imprinting on Renesmee to be creepy. Meyer really drove home the fact that the wolves don't see younger versions of their imprinted loved ones sexually until the object of their imprinting grows to maturity. Like, he treats Nessie as if he were the world's best big brother, not like a pedophile.<br /><br />I was also not really thrown off by the pregnancy itself. Sure, it was a little out there, and it doesn't make sense that the vampire venom wouldn't have killed off Edward's sperm, but I set the inconsistency aside and continued to read the story for how it was, regardless of broken rules.<br /><br />What really got on my nerves, however, was the anti-climatic ending. There's nothing I hate more than that, and it's the same issue with the Host - there was so much build up about how the V were going to attack and cause a lot of damage, and that there would be a great deal of suffering - yet nothing happens at the end except for Irina being the unfortunate unlucky one (not that anyone except Tanya cares) and a lot of \\"I'm sorry :(\\".<br /><br />At the very LEAST I would have enjoyed seeing the V attack, and see some of our favorite characters die. To be honest I would have enjoyed seeing Edward and Bella die, dying to allow Jacob to run away with Nessie, needing to use the papers Alice went through so much trouble to insinuate were necessary. Melodramatic, maybe, but then again I was never much of an E/B fan.<br /><br />Another thing that got on my nerves - Jacob running away at the end of Eclipse had SO MUCH potential. I wish Meyer didn't simply bring him back to the wedding that easy - I would have rather seen Bella forced to go find Jacob if she cares for him that much. Maybe after she became a vampire, and seen Jacob react to her in a feral sense. Anything but \\"he randomly shows up at the wedding.\\"<br /><br />All in all, I wasn't unhappy until I got to the ending. Please, Meyer, work on fixing your anti-climatic tendencies. It is extremely disappointing to get to the end of the book and feel like nothing has actually happened.her seen Bella forced to go find Jacob if she cares for him that much. Maybe after she became a vampire, and seen Jacob react to her in a feral sense. Anything but \\"he randomly shows up at the wedding.\\"    All in all, I wasn't unhappy until I got to the ending. Please, Meyer, work on fixing your anti-climatic tendencies. It is extremely disappointing to get to the end of the book and feel like nothing has actually happened.
031606792X|1.0|First I'd like to say that I greatly admire Stephenie Meyer as the author of the first three Twilight books.  However, I have lost a significant amount of respect after reading Breaking Dawn.  This will certainly impact my desire to read any of her future books.      I've never seen a series go so off the rails. Where was her publishing company?  What about her agent?  Her friends?  Why didn't anyone warn Stephenie?  I find it hard to believe they didn't have strong opinions.  Or did Stephenie believe as the author she knew best?  Either way, someone made a horrible error in judgement.    WARNING... Spoilers below!    I feel like Stephenie left her characters off the page, stranding them in Eclipse while shifting to some alternate fanfic universe. I love fanfic but SM's leaves a lot to be desired. To be honest, although well written (not crafted), I don't feel like this was a book/story Stephenie wanted to tell. It felt slapped together, like she'd prowled through endless fanfic to steal the best ideas and make them their own. Harsh -- I know but I just didn't feel that she was enjoying writing this book like she did the previous three in the Twilight series. In terms of characters -- she reduced the Cullens to bit parts. Almost parodies of their former selves. Even Edward became a minor character. He had no depth, no angst or true emotion after the first hundred pages. How do you have an epic romance with a one dimensional love interest? Even Bella fell flat. She turned into a thirty year old after she \\"changed.\\" All of her teen angst was gone. There's no panic over her even becoming a mother. She became some sexy bombshell super mom vamp. I'd have no problem with this if there was at least a strong journey of discovery for her. Instead it's: \\"I guess I skipped the whole newborn thing and gosh I look amazing in slinky dresses. I'm so beautiful now and oh - I must have sex all the time instead of meaningful conversations with my boytoy husband!\\"     I won't even delve into the pregnancy or Jacob and Nessie plot lines.     I'm extremely disappointed that SM decided to butcher her own series for the sake of selling more books. Personally, I would have sooner waited a few years for her to do this right.   I would even have preferred Eclipse as the final book.      I'll leave you with one final word -- Disappointing.
B001AW9DKK|4.0|This is flat out one great album. It beats the hell sonically over the dozen or so audiance recording being passed around. Only problem was that this was a marathon concert and so much was left out. So many great songs that they performed it's a shame to see this album so Neil Young/Living With War heavy. I loved LWW very much and played the bejesus out of it, cranking it on my car stereo in the very conservative town I live in. But it would have been really nice to have the other songs from the tour better represented. Guess I'l make my own conpanion disk from the audiance recordings to compliment this album. As it is, though, this is a great souvener from a great tour. If it was a bit more complete it would get 5 stars from me.
0792838068|5.0|I just want to say this right off the bat; I honestly think that 1995 has seriously got to be one of the greatest years of film in recent history.  There are just so many cinematic gems to be found within that particular year, and `Leaving Las Vegas' is truly one of them.  I will admit that I was skeptical at first.  I am not a fan of Nicholas Cage, not in the least.  He is a very mannered, `actorly' type of an actor; you know the type that always appears to be acting.  I prefer my actors to sink into the rawness of their roles.  Look at Crowe for instance, a chameleon type actor who never seems to be acting as much as he is simply `being'.  That, and it also seems very hard for Cage to emote any fluctuation in emotion; he just comes off one note.  I adored him in `Matchstick Men', a film that embellished his mannerisms and made them work to his advantage; and I loved him in `Adaptation', a performance that he openly attests to his going contrary to everything he's build his acting career on.  In other words, he played the character as if he was a different actor, and it worked beautifully.<br /><br />Those two stellar performances aside and Nicholas Cage is a mediocre at best actor in my eyes.  So you can understand why watching yet another Cage film was not really that appealing to me.<br /><br />Well, I'll just say that I am extremely glad that I decided to give it a go.<br /><br />`Leaving Las Vegas' is responsible, not only for Cage's finest performance, but is honestly his finest film; ever.  Yes, it is bleak and depressing and ultimately heartbreaking, but it is so emotionally connected without being overly sappy and or too heavy handed.<br /><br />As a quick side point, that is another wonderful thing about the films of 1995; they are truly effecting without being spoonfuls of sympathy.  Films like `Leaving Las Vegas' and the overwhelmingly fantastic `Dead Man Walking' are able to crawl inside the viewer and grab hold of their beating heart with a realness and rawness that reflects real life and not Hollywood's overly saccharine fabrication of it.<br /><br />Anyways; back to the film.  `Leaving Las Vegas' centers on a relationship that forms between as alcoholic mess of a man named Ben and a `hooker with a heart' named Sera.  Ben has lost everything to his drinking, or is it that he starting drinking because he lost everything...either way, he has nothing except the bottle and so he decides to cash out all his savings and put himself up in Vegas to drink himself to death.  The end looks gloomy and bitter for Ben, but he winds up meeting Sera and things start to change for him.  Sera is tired and lonely and just needs someone to talk to, and when Ben pays her to just sit and talk she realizes that she needs him as much as he needs her.  He tells her his plan and warns her not to try and ask him to change, that he will never stop drinking, and she allows herself to comply because she needs to be with him, but as they come closer with one another her love for Ben starts to tear away at her commitment to him.<br /><br />It feels weird for me to say this, but the strongest facet of this film is the acting.  Cage embodies Ben with such rawness and accuracy.  I remember when I watched Meg Ryan devour her character in `When a Man Loves a Woman'; how she really soaked up her characters addiction.  That is what Cage does here.  His shakes and stutters and tantrums are so real, so believable and ultimately so heart wrenching.  As good (or even great) as Cage is, Elizabeth Shue is a revelation.<br /><br />Another quick side point about 1995 in general; it was truly an astonishing year for leaving ladies.  The entire Oscar shortlist is beyond compare when stacked up against their usual picks for each and every performance nominated is worthy, even if I would replace one or two.  Shue, Sarandon, Streep, Thompson, Stone...all of them are flawless and deserving of an Oscar (especially Shue and Sarandon) but there was Kidman in `To DieFor' and even Silverstone in `Clueless' (such a fantastic comedic performance).

031606792X|5.0|WEll first of all its a great book. You get to find out what happens to Bella and Edward and the rest of characters but the not so good thing is that she should have spilt it up it was to much to take at once and you get a little confused. But overall it was great i love how she writes and she didn't let me down. I only hoped this wasn't the last book but since it is theirs other books to read and maybe shell write something else.
031606792X|4.0|I liked it but it made no sense. I was sad that was the ending she gave it.
031606792X|5.0|It was a bit long, but it was well worth the wait! Congratulations to Meyer...you did a FANTASTIC job!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is the best cancelled sci-fi show ever!! After every episode I ask myself, \\"Why was this show cancelled?\\" This show would have been as great as Stargate, had the sci-fi channel received the rights to it instead of FOX! Anyways, this show has great computer graphics and a wonderful cast, it make you want to jump into the scene and join in. Everyone who has ever liked sci-fi should own this series!!
B000002BQK|5.0|This is, in my opinion, the only brilliant album from mariah carey. if you don't know which album from her to buy, don't hesitate, this is the one. Here you will be able to listen to fantastic R&B and hip-hop songs never released in single, such as \\"the roof\\" and \\"babydoll\\". one of the most interessting songs that you will definately fall in love with is \\"the beautiful ones\\", originatelly released in the album purple rain, from prince. In this record mariah manages to sing in her own way in a duet with trey mantaining arrengements that makes you recall \\"purple rain\\". Sad, beautiful and brilliant are the words to describe this album. Buy it
B0015DYIH2|5.0|First off, I am thirty years old, so this review is from a non-teen perspective.  OK.  I was extremely worried when I saw all the very low stars on here.  Nevertheless, I read it anyway (I mean, what &iexcl;¥obsessed&iexcl;¦ fan would&iexcl;¦t?).  (Not only did I read it, but I got it at 11pm Saturday&iexcl;Xas soon as it was available on the Kindle&iexcl;Xand read for about 2 hours, then skipped church to read all day Sunday, when I finished at 10pm.  I had a nice 24-hours.  º.)  I loved it.  It &iexcl;§wrapped&iexcl;¨ everything up nicely &iexcl;§in a bow.&iexcl;¨  I personally love that.  There is too much crap and unhappy real-life endings in the world that I want this type of ending in the books I choose to read.<br /><br />There are plenty of summaries of what happens and how, so I leave that off and focus on my enjoyment of the book.<br /><br />***Contains MAJOR Spoilers***<br /><br />It did have a happy ending, and that is what I loved about it.  Everyone gets what they want and/or should in the end.  Some of it is rough on people, but I think that helps keep the book in the realm of &iexcl;§reality&iexcl;¨ ;-)  Bella gets pregnant, has a half human, half vampire child.  Bella becomes a vampire and has no first-year problems.  Nice.  This way, we don&iexcl;¦t have to not like her as a vampire (half of the readers wanted her to become one and were probably ignoring what that would really mean &iexcl;V OK, its fiction, but still blood, death, and mayhem&iexcl;Knot good.).  And wow, Jacob is imprinted on Bella and Edward&iexcl;¦s daughter.  Mmmmm.  Problems for them, but they get through them, and this contains the answer to several problems.  I liked it.  Jacob is finally happy and so is Bella (although Edward seemed a little moody about the whole thing, but that kept it &iexcl;§real,&iexcl;¨ and really, what did you expect, it is his daughter and Jacob).<br /><br />***End of Spoilers***<br /><br />I loved it, can&iexcl;¦t say enough about it.  In fact, it was my favorite.  If I could put the books in order of their appeal to me, it would be:<br /><br />*Breaking Dawn<br />*Twilight<br />*Eclipse<br />*New Moon*Eclipse  *New Moon
031606792X|1.0|i loved the first three books, i've read them dozens of times. literally. i dutifully picked up my copy of  breaking dawn first thing saturday morning, started reading it first thing, and finished sunday night. completely disappointed.     it's hard not to tell you what i don't like about this book without revealing some spoilers, and if you've read the book you might be able to pinpoint some of the already famous things, but in a nutshell, i just think this one was badly written. too much dialog, too much description. i understand this book has to be like a child to stephenie now, wanting to pour as much detail as she can into her dream, but it just gets boring. and the first three books were hardly ever boring. which is ironic, because i think at the heart of the first three books it was a simple love story while the last one feels more like someone trying to write a book that would make it to the silver screen.     knowing all this, would i have bought the book anyway? probably, because reviewers can't speak for everyone. it's nice to see how a series you've read over and over ends, even if it manages to disappoint you severely.
B0017R5UAA|5.0|Great harmonies, lots of different instruments, and generally good catchy music is what this cd is about. If you like this album, check out the Sun Giant EP which is also quite good!
B00005JNJV|1.0|Boy, am I ever glad I saw this film without paying for it... I think I would have felt ripped off if I did. It was almost laughable the extent to which the film went to insult Asians. First, it begins with a young Bruce Wayne in a Chinese prison camp, fighting off about a dozen attackers. He does so easily, because he is a mighty white man, of course. Yet, the Asian guards are even wary of him. He gets out of jail after a debonaire older white man visits him, and tells him to visit a remote Asian monastery. On the way up to the monastery, he passes through a village -- where everyone he encounters happens to speak English in that funny little Asian way. The monastery is ostensibly a ninja school, run by an old mystical Asian man. Yet, none of the \\"ninjas\\" are Asian! They're black, they're white, they're everything but Asian! The debonaire white man who visited him earlier turns out to be his trainer, and they forge a bond. Bruce soon fights the Asian \\"master\\" of the school, and wins. Later, Bruce  finds out that Asian \\"master\\" was a dupe, and the real ninja master was that debonaire white man. So how improbable is that? A ninja school run by a white man, out of a remote monastery in Asia. Hollywood cuts out all the Asians altogether. They don't count, in the matrix of Hollywood, or in this film. They're just punching bags for the mighty white man. Oh yeah -- and the film was just so boring, overly long, and the fight scenes more than a little pathetic, a bunch of choppy shots.
031606792X|5.0|This book explores into each character more.. I loved it. I think it gave the characters what they needed in order to bring their stories to life. Way to go Meyers!
031606792X|1.0|It killed it. Seriously. Breaking Dawn was something I had only little hope for. Obviously, I wished that it wouldn't have some cheap, crappy end that my cat could write better, and obviously, that's what we got. I knew not everything I would want to happen would, but this was very unexpected and unwanted.     Oh sure, the first few chapters were okay; I thought maybe it would eventually change to better chapters, and ultimately, an extremely well ending. After a few more chapters, I got worried. I was asking myself, hey, wtf is going on here? Bella and Edward have lost their romance, and lay around all day having sex while their kid (who f'ing names their kid Renesme?!?) is taken care of by the Cullens (+ Jacob). Vampire friends start showing up, not to fight, of course, but to stand with the Cullens against the Volturi. No, really, just stand there. Great character developement in those chapters. Oh sure, Bella almost dies, and...no wait. That's it. That's pretty much all the action you're going to get.     Jacob, who before I didn't like all that much, had the best \\"book\\". I actually found myself in relief when his \\"book\\" started. Before I used to hate reading parts with him; I found him annoying, obsessive, and immature; and now the tables are turned. Bella is the annoying, obsessive, immature one, and I find myself actually saddened that he didn't imprint on Leah. No, he has to settle for his ex's screwed up daughter, who I feel bad for. I feel bad for all the characters. Their story could have ended much, much better.    Stephenie Meyer was, in my opinion, a pretty good author. Maybe new to it, and still learning, but pretty good. That doesn't apply to her anymore. New, maybe not as much, but pretty good? No. Way.    (Mom's account)
031606792X|1.0|All I can say is...ugh!  I loved the first three books, hated this final one.  I know Meyer said this is how it was all supposed to wrap up, but, this is just disappointing, and downright weird.  Jake imprinting on Edward and Bella's baby?  Poor Rose having to watch Bella get everything she had wanted in life?  Edward turning into a complete wus--\\"I can't teach you to fight--I can't hurt you\\" And, if Edward called Bella \\"love\\" one more time, I thought I was going to scream (he didn't call her that in the other three books--where did that come from?)!  Can we give her another shot at this--I'd be willing to wait for the REAL Breaking Dawn that I know is out there!
031606792X|5.0|The Twilight Saga is a great story & this feels like a great ending.  She ends all of the pieces of her story succinctly.  Unlike many stories, Meyer's tale feels like she's had a plan for it all along.  Real life may not end so well, but I enjoy her happily ever after!!!
B00005214X|5.0|Do yourself a favor: buy this album. When it arrives, put everything else aside, get your headphones on, lie on your bed, close your eyes, and listen to it beginning to end. This is an album that deserves to be listened to in one sequence before you start listening to each song individually.    This album is a journey through George's soul, and if you're lucky, your own soul as well. Yes, it's long, but all meditations are long. Listen carefully to the lyrics as you lie there, try to get the imagery in your head.    This is the best album by any solo Beatle. Yes, better than Lennon's \\"Imagine\\" and \\"Plastic Ono Band\\", better than McCartney's \\"Band on the Run\\". Those are phenomenal albums with some great individual songs, but this one stands alone as an experience to be treasured.    The only flaw with this album is that some of the jams at the end are kind of filler. You'll probably only listen to them once. You'll probably be in a trance by then, so it'll be really cool, but once you snap out of it you'll realize that you're hungry and the album is running a bit long. But that's okay, because more is better when it comes to George Harrison. Bless you, George.
031606792X|5.0|I read all the negative reviews before I had a chance to hardly make it through the first few chapters, so i didn't know what to expect. But I was very pleased. Stephenie took this in directions I didn't see it going, yet it fit the characters. The characters wrote their own story and it came out to be an amazing ending for such a great saga. It keeps you on your edge from beginning to end. Don't go in with certain expectations, go in with the desire to know how such an intense love story ends.
031606792X|1.0|This is definately a finale for the thirteen-year-old fangirls. It is the ultimate FanFiction fantasy that makes absolutely no sense but nontheless tries very hard to please and tie things up in a pretty little bow, casting aside all complexity and logic. Just as long as everyone gets a happy ending.     It is clear that Stephenie Meyer completely gave up on the franchise after completing book three and quickly came up with the concept for Breaking Dawn after a wild night of liquid indulgence. It does not read like a Twilight novel, but rather a daydream of what the characters themselves wish could have happened. It's like the Twilight Zone version of Twilight. After reading it, you'll no doubt find yourself what REALLY happened while you were busy reading the wish-fulfilment version. I bet we all missed out on a lot.    It seems the author tried to distract us from realizing that she didn't deliver on any of what the first three built up to by dazzling us with a **SPOILER** child that, by her own rules, shouldn't exist.
031606792X|5.0|Really fun read.    People are over thinking this. It's a work of fiction. A fun to read work of fiction that has many great characters and one outstandingly charming character that will stand with the literary greats as perhaps one of the greatest characters of all time. Stephenie Mayer can sleep well at night knowing that in Edward Cullen, she has achieved immortality herself. Any nitpicking beyond that achievement is futile and begins to belittle her accomplishment.    Sure, it could've gone differently, but in the end it was a fun read - entertaining to the last. And for that, it is a highly recommended and delightful final addition to the Twilight Saga.
031606792X|1.0|Horrific.  I absolutely will not accept this piece of plop is the real Breaking Dawn, and till I die will believe Stephanie Meyer's publisher got her spoof mixed up with the real one, and it's too late to say anything now.      These weren't the same characters, it wasn't even the same frickin' world.  I can't begin to describe the plot because it'd do it too much justice.  Just put it down.  And run away.  Atrocious.  Repellant.  Sickening.  Utter stupidity. I feel so disappointed and betrayed all I can do is spout disassociated words to convey how truly awful this book is.  Fantasy?  It sure is.  Just like Pan's Labyrinth, but with way more vomit and way less sense.  Sort of like this review.
031606792X|1.0|**CONTAINS SPOILERS**    Along with many others on August second I was ecstatic  the moment I had the book that I had been waiting for was finally in my hands. The three other books were my OBSESSION. I would re-read them over and over again. I was an avid fan fiction reader, desprate for something to keep my mind off of the long wait for this book.     I loved the first two chapters, and the description of the wedding. Although I thought that things were moving a little too fast, I figured it would soon get better.  Boy, was I wrong.  I'm not sure what happened to Steph's writting. There was no dialoge, no character development. Edward was virtually not there. There was none of his character. Where was the beautiful, kind, 100 year old vampire we all loved? Even when he was upset about bruising Bella, we only had little bits of him there when in so many ways he could have done more, had more to say.  ok, so I said before that I read fan fictions, anticipating Breaking Dawn. As I read the descriptions I would always pass over the ones that mentioned Bella getting pregnant. I mean, really! How many times had Stephenie said that it was impossible?  Apparently not. This was so out there. So unrealsitic.     Then we move to Jakes POV. I was always team Edward, but I still loved Jake. Just more in a little brother way. What was up with this part? I liked the whole pack thing that happened, but it was obvious somehting of the sort would happen as soon as we found out that Jake was the true Alpha (in Eclipse)I actually really enjoyed having another perspective on this (and especially Jakes!)But what is up with Jake imprinting on Nessie??(I'm still not sure how you go from Reneesme to nessie but okay.) It was to weird and very unrealistic that everything would work out perfectly. That Jake would still be a prominent part of Bella's life. There should have been some sacrafice in there, something that Bella had to give up with becoming a vampire.    We finally come to the third part. I ust admit, for a while there I actaully thought this book was going to turn itself around. I loved reading about her as a vampire and finally Edwards \\"equal\\". I even thought for a second that there might be some fighting, ANYTHING to break up the monotony of this book. But of course everything works out perfectly and everyone lived happily ever after.    Honestly if this was a fanfiction I would have stopped reading long ago.     I'm still in shock. How could something that was set up to be so perfect go so wrong?  I'm sure there are those out there who genuinley like this book. And I can not say how jelous I am of them. I really wanted a good ending. Tne best I can do is not let this book taint my love of the other books, and for all those who dislike it also I suggest you do the same.
B0016A2FFG|5.0|This album is outstanding because it is vintage Al Green in 2008.  What a treat.  I call it triple S--spiritual, soulful and sexy. The music, singing, appearances by guests such as Anthony Hamilton, Corinne Bailey Rae, and John Legend make the album even more special.  This is truly one of a kind from a musical giant and legend and definitely should be added to one's collection.  We are humbled.
031606792X|5.0|I would have been so upset if had ended any other way.  What is wrong with a book actually having a happy ending?  I think that is what is lacking in todays socieity.  Koodoos to Stephanie Meyer for not taking the cheap route and putting an evil underminded twist to such a delightfull series of love ever after.
B001DDBCV4|5.0|I have been a fan of the series \\"Sex and the City\\" since 2000, when I watched HBO's recap of the first two seasons one late night on HBO2. From that moment on, even at the age of 13 I feel in love with these characters: Miranda (the cynic), Charlotte (the old-fashioned), Samantha (the slut), and Carrie (the social anthropologist). But those one-dimension descriptions do not do the series justice at all. For 6 beautiful seasons the HBO comedy turned dramedy focused upon the life and adventures of a group of friends who see their friendship mature and blossom into a family while they try to navigate down the crazy road of love.    Over a year ago when I heard news that a long-awaited feature-film was actually a possibility to say the least I was a little scared. I remember the how for the course of a year the anticipation kept building up and up for the films impending May 2008. And when cast interviews, trailers, and posters started to appear I got really excited. And then release day came and I was there at midnight with my best friend, dressed up and excited. And to say honest the movie didn't disappoint at all.    While the film had some flaws at the element of being a feature film (what is to be expected from a first-time director), it wasn't the special effects or camera angles that were important. No, it was the acting and the reunion of characters that fans have been missing for the past 5 years. The story serious didn't disappoint, even with its whooping 2 ½ hour run-time. It was the story that everyone was hoping for: One of reunions, love, the testament of commitment, the butterflies that come with everything at stake, and the beautiful experiences of love. At the level of plot the producers kept almost everything rush until after the film's release - which was a very good idea. Giving away even the minorist of plot details would destroy the films experience, and lessen the effect of the girl's reunion. All I have to say is that there are moments you'll find your jaw on the group, your eyes tearing up, and your chest aching from laughter. It truly is an adventure in those 2 ½ hours.    The film's $55 million release weekend take accompanied by the almost $400 total gross is a testament to the fans that love this show. HBO has already planned a sequel and even a third film later down the line. And while I believe those films will be amazing - they will not be able to capture the magic of this original film. It was the reunion people didn't think would happen, and it provide that beyond the dramas of life, friendship will truly survive.
031606792X|5.0|I am so satisfied and happy with this book, words cannot describe. I have no idea why people hate it so much. Stephenie Meyer created the perfect ending for the perfect series, and I thank her tremendously for it. The book has shocking surprises, and all the the other elements Stephenie uses to draw a reader in. I absolutely loved it!
031606792X|1.0|I have been a huge fan of the Twilight series, and I have been very excited to read the finale, Breaking Dawn.   I was very disapointed in this book.  The voices of the main characters had changed, almost to the point of being un-recognizable.  Honeymoon scene...totally dropped the ball.  Where was the romance?  I knew with the genre of the book being YA, it wouldnt be graphic.  But it was, um..boring.  Edward is now a patsy.  Hardly the guy we all fell in love with.  Bella is now super-vampire, learns in days what most of the other vamps spend decades learning.  Jacob? Nessie? Please! I know this is a work of fantasy fiction, but it just did not fit with the series.    In my opinion, the book completely \\"jumped the shark\\".
031606792X|2.0|I loved the first book, read it in one weekend. The second was good, though not as good. The third was a little tiresome, especially the whole chastity bit. But this? Eeesh. Yesterday, I read a NY Times article about Alan Ball's new HBO series, \\"True Blood\\" based on the Southern Vampire series by Charlaine Harris about Sookie Stackhouse, a young waitress who has a vampire for a boyfriend. I never heard of Harris but Sookie has a gift for reading minds, except it won't work on her boyfriend. Hmmmmmm, doesn't Edward have that same gift which doesn't work on Bella? I will have to check out Harris' books and HBO's series.
0671027344|5.0|I read this book a few years ago when making the transition from high school to college. I've never read a book quite like this one and thus it holds a special place in my heart. It's almost impossible to not relate to the main character, Charlie. The timing of when I read this book was also a bit of a coincidence while he was adjusting to high school, I was adjusting to college. The language and punctuation of the book is humorous and entertaining. You watch a boy begin to grow up and you feel a real connection with the character by the end of the book. Some compare this book to The Catcher In The Rye but I find this book way better than that. The book reads quickly and has a MAJOR twist at the end. I'd reccommend this book for just about any teenager especially if you're making the first step into high school or college. I think that older readers would find this book interesting as well. So, go ahead and pick it up - I assure you that you won't put it down.
031606792X|3.0|I must admit before I start my review that I am totally in love with Edward Collins. I know, I know, he's a fictional character but he is the quintessential man that every woman wants in their life.  I've read the previous books three times and still can't get enough but Breaking Dawn I'll only be able to take one time around. Don't get me wrong, it was captivating but not in the sense that I had for the other books. With this story line I couldn't put it down because I was waiting for something exciting to happen, waiting to get to the end and be done with it.   Her other novels captured the intense love between Edward and Bell and even Jacob. It made you remember your first love and how it felt being so wrapped around that special person in your life. But Breaking Dawn, to me anyway, portrayed Edward as being weak and unsure. I hated that because Edward was always such a strong character for me. Like when they found out the Voultri were coming, it was like Edward didn't even want to put up a fight, he was content with letting the Voultri kill them all. From my point of view if he loved Bella and Renesmee as much has the whole saga claimed, he would have wanted to fight, fight until the death to save his family with just as much gusto as the fight between him and Victoria. I also started to like Jacob more with his point of views during BOOK 2.  Now the whole pregnancy thing kind of threw me for a loop but it was well played out. I came to fall in love with Renesmee and her abilities. I know that some people were upset about the imprinting and it didn't sit well with me either but for different reasons. My first thought was, how can Jacob, being a werewolf/shape-shifter/whatever, imprint on something that his sole purpose is to destroy? That seemed a bit off but I never took it as Jacob being a pedophile, just the logic behind it. And then I was glad that Jacob had someone to love and to love him back.  The later half of the book started to get better with the impending battle but even that fell short. There really should've been an intense battle scene with all of them fighting to end the Voultri's rule. I was eagerly  waiting for Jane, Demetri, and Felix to get their just due. I felt let down like Stephan and Vladimir.   All in all I am glad that Bella, Edward, and Jacob got their happy ending but it fell short of the grand finale closing that Harry Potter's seventh novel delivered.    Would I always be a Twilight saga fan? Yes. Would I read Breaking Dawn again? Only if I was bored and had nothing else to read!
0307237702|3.0|The Audacity of Hope is as good a title as any for this book by a young, rookie Senator.   And the hope at the heart of his writing and thoughts is well placed, for in this, Barack Obama's Second book, despair lurks in the margins.     He as much as admits to this at several places in the book.  He sees the country so completely divided on certain issues that finding a solution to the myriad social and economic problems connected to those issues seems almost like a dream.      Indeed, there is one constant subtext throughout the book: Barack's restlessness at the slow pace of governmental change.  The rules and the glacial pace of Senate procedures simultaneously fascinate and frustrate him.  He is in awe of just how good the framers of the constitution set up this great political experiment. However, the machine of the Senate, and the current business of politics, seem to him an almost torturous affair. Early in the book, Barack explains that what is debated day in and day out in the Senate is not (contrary to what most laymen perceive,) what the NEW laws should be.  Instead, most of the time is spent trying to figure out what the EXISTING laws actually mean. (This experience in the Senate seems to have opened his eyes to just how important the appointment of Judges are.)     He bristles at the tediousness of some of this, and he openly wonders at just how quickly he may find himself caught up in the machinery that has consumed so many before him. For instance he starts one chapter talking about just how nice it is to fly on private jets. He is very descriptive of the pleasures of this elite way of travel.  But he is also aware of just how much it separates him from the everyday American's experience.     More apparent though is Barack's ambitious nature seem too large for a long term career in the Senate,      He wants a larger stage on which to operate and to articulate his thoughts, and this book seems to be a prelude to that.    The Audacity of Hope is split upinto large chapters encompassing big topics, (Race, Faith, etc.,) and within those headings, Obama struggles with the conflicting and seemingly contradictory stances on many sides of the issues. If you follow politics in the news, many of Obama's analogies and examples will be familiar to you, but if you largely stay away from politics, this volume will give you a pretty good idea of what he honestly thinks regarding these issues.       The answer is simple: Like many in America, he struggles.    One of the most telling sequences of the book is when he talks about how the countdown for an approaching Roll Call vote.  He laments that when complicated issues, involving many complex factors, come down to the final vote, you almost always are wishing for more time.     The book is political, and more specifically campaign-oriented in nature, so it can often get a bit wonkish and, well, boring, but Barack has a way of bringing it back to simplicity with a humorous aside.      In light of his more recent popularity, (one hundred thousand people seeing him in Berlin,) it is interesting to read his account of traveling around Illinois alone as a virtually unknown candidate and sometimes speaking to 4 or 5 people.  My favorite anecdote involves his invitation to a Union gathering during a primary for one office he was seeking.  While he sat onstage waiting to speak, the man introducing him basically announced that the Union would be endorsing somebody else, but adds that \\"Mr. Obama is here to give us his thoughts.\\"    Once finished with the book, you can understand a little more about Barack Obama's political thinking. And a little about the gamble he seems to be taking in the upcoming election for President of the United States. Obama, if I read correctly, is gambling that MOST people in the United States feel as he does. That most people struggle with these issues in the same ways and would like to see an end to partisan politics.
031606792X|1.0|Spoiler Alert - Don't Read This If You Don't Want Spoilers      I am a die hard Twilight fan, the books were enjoyable escapism into the world of vampires and the humans who love them in Breaking Dawn we see that world turned upside down. I was okay with everything until Book 2, and not because I don't like Jacob, I like Jacob, especially when he is getting over Bella. But in this book, his story was the only thing worth reading about. Bella and Edward are so boring and unlike themselves it was painful to continue to read the book after Book 1.    Let's begin, Bella, our iconic hero who is baffled she is 18 and getting married suddenly is pregnant and guess what is thrilled. Rosalie, our blonde bombshell who hates Bella is there by her side, and if Bella dies wouldn't care in previous books and definitely in this one, basically gets to raise the kid. Hey wait, she pretty much does that anyway. Bella is in full-on martyrdom now. Was Bella ever a martyr, she was like us, normal, in every respect. She just happened to fall in love with Edward.    Edward is not our Edward anymore. No more are there loving touches and words, we get a wooden character with no attachment to his demon-spawn. In this matter I don't blame him, she was killing our Bella.     Renesme or Nessie. What a pointless plot device, how about we focus on Bella as a vampire, or Bella enjoying sex, Edward seeing he didn't kill her and maybe college? Nope, baby time it is.     Jacob was redeemable until imprinting on Nessie. Why, couldn't he normally fall in love, over time with Leah? It seemed that's where the plot was going, but no yet again, a pointless plot that leads no where.    Where were the Cullens? Dr Cullen, knowing Bella could literally pop at any moment, goes to get blood? Esme frets but says nothing, Alice and Jasper are gone, Emmett says sex jokes. Where is our beloved family?    Charlie is cool with babies, vampires and wearwolves? Right, great Police officer there.    I'm sorry I loved thebooks but this was inexcusable. I've read better, more involving fan fiction by 13 year olds.     Bella becomes a Mary Sue, and I hated her for it. Edward isn't our knight in shinning, sometimes coming to our window in dented armor, he's just boring, Jacob almost redeemed himself if he had actually moved on with someone, I'd have liked it to be Leah. but nope he's in Bella life for all time. The Cullens are useless and Nessie, all I can say is that I wanted her dead before she was born.
0385720920|4.0|I had high hopes for this book. Most of my friends who read Palahniuk reccommended this one saying that it was one of their favorites. I've read about half a dozen Palahniuk books now and this one might be my least favorite. Reading the premise of the story on the back of the book it seemed promising. Don't get me wrong the book is still pretty good just not as good as his other work. Palahniuk has always had semi-erotic content in books but went a little overboard on this one (of course, it's sure to be worse in Snuff) and the entire book seemed to revolve around sex instead of him choking for money to pay the hospital bills for his mother's care. Overall, I give the book 4 stars and would give it 5 if only it would've been less sex and more focus on the main plot of the story. The ending of the book is pretty good which is preceeded by a couple of twists (classic Chuck) and was worth the read. I'd reccommend this book for anyone wanting to read something a little different but beware of excessive sexual content but don't let this be your first Palahniuk read - try Survivor or Fight Club first.
031606792X|5.0|Honestly, I thought it was amazing. Everyone who didn't like this last book seems to be basing it on how well it fit into what THEY wanted to happen. Well newsflash, you're not writing it. It's certainly a matter of opinion of course, but if you're really going to hate the book because you believe every girl should go to college/not marry young/wait on babies, etc...well maybe if you're that stuck on your high horse you shouldn't be reading stories about vampires. I have two degrees, did not marry young, and have no babies yet...but that doesn't mean I'm going to knock someone else's happy ending because their life didn't follow mine. Bella's maturity has already been dicussed, even her mother knows she's an old soul. She may not be on par with Edward's 100 years, but she's breezing through 17 to middle aged. And while they average high schooler may not be capable of such mature emotion, this one apparently was. And I was happy for her. I WANTED everything to work out for Bella and Edward. That's why I read, to escape reality. I like happy endings, because I know real life doesn't always have one. And they weren't without their fair share of heartache and heartbreak. If anything, after they pain they've had to deal with in some of the past books, I wasn't ready to see anyone suffer anymore. I didn't want her to have to choose between two loves, I WANTED everybody to win. And they did. And it was nerve-racking getting to that point. I had to keep putting the book DOWN so I could regulate my breathing.     I thought this was an amazing way to end the series. Halfway through I thought it couldn't get any better, and it did. If you were seriously hoping in the end that she'd go back to being \\"normal\\" and give up on the life she wanted so badly...why the heck were you even reading this?
031606792X|2.0|I was really looking forward to this book, and have to say, I was dissapointed.  the preganancy thing was farfetched, but seriously, did Bella realy have to DRINK blood to save the 'child'.  that was just gross, and then to put it in a sippy cup, and give her a straw!  Then, she doesnt even mind, she 'kind of likes it'.  give me a break!
006085880X|2.0|Though the overall story was entertaining, I was sadly disappointed that this was a \\"final draft.\\" Throughout the entire book, I was continually caught up in the amount of grammatical/conventional errors. About a quarter of the way through, I was tempted to get out a red pen and circle the errors to then send back the book to the editing company. I've never read a book with so many errors. There were countless times \\"an\\" was written instead of \\"a,\\" repeated words (\\"she she said\\") were throughout, and I ran into a couple of spelling errors.   If this book had been read over a couple of times by even a high school English teacher, I probably would have enjoyed it more.
031606792X|3.0|I'm going to go ahead and put a *spoilers* alert on this, just in case I say anything I shouldn't.    I enjoyed the first three books immensely, so much so, that when The Host came out, I went out and purchased a book on the first day available for the first time.    Sadly, I think more effort went into her first \\"adult\\" novel than into this YA novel (that is, in my opinion, a regular novel in disguise).  I think Stephenie Meyer has overextended herself.    It started out with potential, but it quickly disintegrated into convenience.  Stephenie seemed to be trying too hard to wrap up her saga and create another story at the same time. A story that seemed sorely out of place. Bella's transition was entirely too dumbed down.  There should have been more to it than that.  The vivid images that Stephenie paints are still there, but something is lacking. I wanted to know the story beyond the convenient ending, I would have liked to see 100 years into their future. The ultimate person that Jake imprinted on was weird AND way too convenient.     I am happy with the way things ultimately turned out, so I won't give this anything less than three stars, but I'm taking away two because I think this was just a case where the author tried too hard. She needed to wrap up her story, but introduce new elements and unfortunately, the new elements didn't quite work, in my opinion. I liked the idea of Nessie, but not the way she was presented and certainly not the nickname!
031606792X|2.0|I am so sad that Stephenie Meyer chose to write the ending of a truely wonderful love story this way.  I allowed my 11 year old to read the first three stories and she loved them just as much as I did.  I WILL NOT allow her to read this one.  It seemed(and obviously I am NOT alone in this thought)that another person wrote this story.  I was very happy that she chose not to go into TOTAL vivid detail about their honeymoon but the baby/birth was WAY too much.  I am afraid she shot herself in the foot with this one.  I too am pretending that Eclipse was the last book.  Sorry Stephenie, you missed the mark totally with this one!!
031606792X|3.0|This was probably the most challenging book of the series to get through. There was a lot of deeper content and just layers and layers of meaning and emotion that needed to be taken in. I did really like the book, though it was not my favorite. I do feel that it will have to grow on me a bit. I loved the relationship dynamics that were displayed in the text - the love-hate bits, the loyalty, the difficulty of the situations and its effect on the characters, the reactions of the characters, all of it. I was pleased with Jacob's fate, even got a good laugh out of the irony of it all. Being on Team Edward, I was also very happy that the pair got their happy ending. Though it didn't appear so until toward the end, the plot developed in true Meyer style -- slow to get going, then take off at the end.    Now for the down points of the 3 part edition. Spoilers all over, sorry guys. I tried to be non-descript above, but I have to point out the flaws specifically.    The entire pregnancy issue just boggles me! First of all, isn't his only bodily fluid supposed to be his venom? So how is this this little halfling even possible? Secondly, I thought that the whole pregnancy was very poorly played out. I almost felt like bad fanfiction. Though I really liked how this section of the book ended, with Edward needing to change her to save her, I believe everything from the time she becomes pregnant (showing symptoms that is) and the point of birth is just terrible.    The only other thing that irked me slightly was that bumbling Bella became SuperVamp, able to control all urges and save her friends, with very little difficulty. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad that she is no longer helplessly clumsy, but I feel like she should have had just a little trouble with her transformation.    Overall, I genuinely liked the book. I think I need to read it again to fully take in and appreciate it as a piece, but I felt closure with it. It had the ending that I hoped it would have and am content with it. :)
B00003CX8Y|3.0|i tried to give it 5 stars but the page is giving me trouble.  The movie is my all time favorite disney movie, but it's so not worth it if it's not the original disney dvd...not to mention selling copies are pretty illegal
031606792X|2.0|I have read all three of the other books, they were wonderful. But when   you write the last book it should be your all time best one ever. I    agree that Jake took it all to \\"good\\", and Bella getting pregnant and   acting like her parents no longer had a right to any news or part of   her life was way uncalled for. For all of Edwards misgivings he sure   could hardly waite to get Bella in bed and then he acted like a wimp with   no care or backbone when Bella was growing huge with the baby and sick.   Both Jake and Edward need to act like Bella really matters more than   fighting with each other. This was a sad ending to an otherwise great   series. I still say read it just because you love all the people in the   books and because even though it was not good Stephanie is still a great   writer.
031606792X|1.0|I loved each of the three books prior to Breaking Dawn but this one was the only book that didn't create some sort of emotional response in me as a reader. It read very much like a fan fiction and was extremely inconsistent with information given in the other books. Much of the Bella that was so endearing in the other three books was missing in Breaking Dawn. Don't get me started on Renesmee. This is likely the only Twilight book I will not re-read. For me the series ends with Eclipse.
031606792X|2.0|I was extremely disappointed in this book.  I really enjoyed the first three books in the series.  I felt a lot was lost in the 4th book just to make sure that everything was absolutely perfect and tied up with a neat little bow.
B000H5U832|5.0|This is a really good kids movie but adults will like it too.  The animation is great and the soundtrack is also really good.  There is a good storyline that can actually be used as a teaching tool also (don't be too full of yourself and/or think you are better than others, better to give than receive, etc.)  I don't think anyone would be disappointed owning this movie.
031606792X|1.0|I pre-ordered two books from Amazon, fully expecting to get them on the release date as I had in the past.   Not so.     Very disappointed with USPS, (United States Postal Service) written out in full, just so you won't miss the irony. But what do you expect from a taxpayer financed boondoggle. Should have gone UPS; private enterprise, competent, you know, American.     First, the tracking shows that its been sitting in Denver since Thursday.     Second, now that I've been reading A TON of negative reviews and many of our friends have already finished the book, I'm still waiting and wondering if I'll ever read the d@mn thing when it arrives (due probably in a year or so).   Should have just gone to Sams Club and waited in line. I would have spent $2 extra on tax and been disappointed during the process and not before cracking the cover page. rrrrr....    Anyway, everyone I've asked about the book usually responds with, \\"aaah, well, [insert excuse] but it was good\\". with a strained smile and unconvinced voice.     I spend hundreds of dollars a year here, one really bad experience out of a dozen.   Well, whadda gonna do?
031606792X|5.0|I don't usually write revies, but I happened on this page and was so shocked to see the 1 start reviews?? I am a 37 yr. old single mom who was introduced to Twilight by my son-I devoured it in 1 night along with the next 2 books. (though the first books was my favorite, until now...)From the first chapter I was hooked-it was everything I had hoped and more than I imagined!! I wanted Bella and Edward together and Bella to become a vampire-done, plus so much more thank that-I don't want to give anything else away for those who have not read it yet. I just want to say that if you are truly a fan of the series, I can not see WHY you would not be as enthralled with this (I hope it really is not the last) final book in the series!
0767812166|5.0|Jeff Bridges plays the part of an alien visiting Earth. A project initiated by scientists sends an invitation out to space, where in 54 Earth languages, aliens are invited to come and see the human race.    The alien takes on the DNA structure of a dead painter whose wife is still grieving for him and the movie starts as she watches old films of her dead husband. The album is on the table and the alien transforms right before our very eyes into human form. Karen Allen plays the part of the widow, who at first believes she had a dream, but soon goes from fear to acceptance to falling in love with the likes of her dearly departed.     It is nice to see one of our favorite actors from \\"The Untouchables\\" playing the part of the government agent who investigates the alien sighting and ultimately saves his life. Don't miss this 1984 movie that shall leave you with the gentle feelings evoked by the likes of E.T.
0783240287|5.0|Donny Osmond does such a fantastic job in this musical.  I saw this live (unfortunately without Donny as the star) and it was good, but Donny made it so much more fun and enjoyable.  His voice and vocal range is amazing and he has such a great range of emotion in this musical. Specifically, during one scene towards the end (somewhere during the groveling scenes - can't remember exactly where) Donny bends down to look at Benjamin who is laying on the ground.  He picks up the golden cup and slams it down with disgust in front of Benjamin.  It actually gave me cold chills the first time (and several times after) I saw it because it is a look that you normally don't see on Donny nor associate with him.  This is a great musical for all ages and I would highly recommend it to everyone.
031606792X|1.0|I'm not sure. The characters are out of character (the marriage, the child, the TV watching, etc.). The plot is, uh, non-existent. There are way too many (it felt like hundreds) of pages of talking leading up to what I was thinking would be a really epic battle scene (even after the fail of the previous, uh, most of the book, I held up hope), but in the end Bella Who's More Awesome Than You saved the day in an extremely disappointing way. Even Meyer's normal strength for making one care for her characters was absent. They could have all died at the end; I would not have cared (except Leah and Garrett - they were great).   Add that to the unresolved plot issues (werewolf paternity drama, hello?) and the extreme use of deus ex machinas and what you end up with is epic...failure.
006135323X|5.0|This is a great read written by a revolutionary economist with the gift of explaining complicated/complex economics to laypeople. A great job, and highly recommended. It will also make you reflect on how you make decisions and whether they are rational decisions.
031606792X|5.0|This book was the perfect conclusion to the story Stephenie Meyer began in Twilight.  If you fell inlove with Twilight then Breaking Dawn is the book that defies the saying \\"You can never go home again.\\"  It has all the intrigue and passion that we came to love in Twilight.  If you loved Twilight then this is the book for you.  Infact if you enjoy good literature then this is the book for you.  Read it you'll see.
B000000WCA|2.0|Bought this for my sister who was really into the Spice Girls at the height of their fame.  I've listened to it with her and there are a couple of good songs but I was in my late 20's when this came out so it was a bit past my interest level.  Music and vocals are ok.  If you are a SG fan, you will like this cd.
031606792X|1.0|Dude, I didn't really like this book. >>' If you haven't been able to tell.     There may be a few spoilers ahead here, so don't like, don't read, and if you comment about how I shouldn't have spoiled... You deserve what ever agony you're in.    First off, everyone seemed SO OOC. Alice, especially, struck me as completely out-of-it. She still had that fashionable side to her, but she seemed a lot more down. Sure, the werewolves and Renesmee[See further down where I kill myself] were blocking her power and she was frustrated with that, she still didn't have that whole perky pizazz.    Renesmee, you guyz. I don't mind the name. I like Nessie as a nickname, it's cute, but the way Bella handled her pissed me off on so many levels!  She goes through hell for over a month for the little beast and after she arrived she didn't seem too much of a priority. I was waiting for her jealousy to unfold as Rosalie and Jacob spent all their time with her. Seriously.   And Bella's \\"power\\". I was eagerly looking forward to her time as a newborn. I wanted SM's in depth description of how one sees and feels. But, no... D: Can you be more Mary Sue-ish? Renesmee is also a mini-Mary Sue.    I wanted her to be Edward Jacob. >>'    And don't get me started on Jacob's imprinting. I was perfectly fine with that one girl, what's-her-face... Lizzie. D:< But their DAUGHTER? Seriously.    As a teenage girl who knows nothing about love, I still know something went wrong in there.    [I think Bella should've taken Jacob's and Edward's offer for Jacob's stud-services, and then Jacob could imprint on //that//. XD]    [/I kinda stopped reading at Defection and got a synopsis of the rest of the happenings from my sister. It sounds even more disappointing after that. >>']
031606792X|1.0|I'm so disappointed in Breaking Dawn that I hardly know where to begin. Other reviewers have already accurately enumerated why this much-awaited novel lands with a splat; I won't belabor the point except to say that after struggling with virtually every page to convince myself to enjoy the book, I just couldn't.     Breaking Dawn was gratuitously violent, disturbing, rang false, and gave some very dubious messages that contradict everything Bella stood for prior to this. The overall effect once I read the last page was profound dismay. I wanted to hurl the book, and then bleach my brain.    Ms. Meyer: What On Earth Happened?! Burnout?! The chess piece on the book jacket is apt: this is one gambit that failed.     I feel it would have been okay with many, if not most, of her readers (of all ages) had she made some tougher, albeit more honest choices for Bella and particularly Jacob. It really does feel as though she was trying to tie everything up in a neat, happy bow, which ultimately had the exact opposite effect.    One more observation: as a parent, this book really, really isn't for under-16's. I'm not referring to sex, rather its aftermath, the results of which were prolonged and, at times, revolting.    I'm passing my copy of Breaking Dawn on to a friend and will try to forget it exists; from here on, I'll stick with the wonder of Twilight and let it simply stand alone in this pyrrhic series.
0452289963|5.0|I am so grateful for Amazon and finding great books at really affordable prices; shipping was prompt and the condition of the book was excellent.  Thank you
B0009ZHJ7S|5.0|My 3 year old niece loves this movie and whenever she comes over, which is often, we have to watch it.  The animation is great and I love the voice over character of Robin Williams.  This part really suited him.  If you have young children, they will really like this movie.  I'd recommend it to anyone.
031606792X|2.0|**************************Spoilers Below**********************************      I have read the 3 other books from the saga, and I truly wanted to like Breaking Dawn.   I am not a fanatic fan but I enjoy this series as a guilty pleasure when I need something light and easy to read.  Unfortunately, I just could not like the novel.  To be honest this novel felt like it was from a completely different series.  The interaction and connection between Bella and Edward was nowhere near what it is the other three novels.  I truly believe it was because Meyer introduced such a curve ball into the plot, which was the surprise child Renesme/Nessie.  Meyer has stated over and over again, that this series was the epic love story of Edward and Bella.      However, Breaking Dawn did not offer the last chapter of the epic love story.      Sure they had the wedding, which was romantic to a point but is seemed, too rushed in my opinion.  I am still wondering what Meyer found so exciting about writing the wedding to seemed to fall dead to me.   There were no details on how much love was shown in Edward's face while she was walking down the aisle or Bella's reaction to how handsome Edward looked; Meyer always seems to mention his beauty.  There was not a lot of interaction between her parents, her human friends, nothing.  Also why didn't she have a bachelorette party?  Sure not every bride has one but why no last hooray with the girlfriends that she was close to like Alice or Angela.  Yes that might not be in Bella's character in the first 3 books but you would think that Meyer would write Alice forcing Bella into one because it is definitely in Alice's character.    The honeymoon could have offered so much more and shown the connection and love between the two.  Instead of telling us what they did, snorkel and fly through the jungle, why didn't she have any scenes where they interacted with each other, like in the meadow?  Sure they are soul mates and know each other so well, unlike their first time in the meadow, but Meyer still could have had more interaction that wasn't Bella begging for sex with Edward.    The fact that Bella begged for sex still gets me.  Sure she made the deal to marry Edward to get sex in the first place, but it was ridiculous how much she begged for it while on Isle Esme.  (I still have an issue with that deal)  Also the fact that Meyer wrote Bella to take advantage of Edward's wishes of her going to college as a way for her to have more human sex was very absurd.  I can see why Meyer didn't give the readers a detail account of the sex but she could have at least given the readers a reaction of how she felt after and how she feels so much closer to Edward, considering how cheesy she can get.      The whole Vamp/Human baby still is a complete shock to me.  Having heard the spoilers, I seriously thought that that they were a rumor, how wrong was I.  I think that if Meyer had not made the famous statement of how vampires can't have children, it might not have been so bad.  To state that fact (vampires can't have babies) and then find a loophole is just a cope out to me.  Very amateur writing if you ask me.  The whole baby story line is amateur.  I personally found it hilarious how she foreshadowed her being pregnant by having her eat eggs all the time and also the fact that she was snacking on raw chicken while it was cooking and having her disliked the taste of cooked chicken.  The fact that she was only a little suspicious about something moving inside of her was dense.  Also the fact that Edward has gone through med school twice and didn't see something fishy until the last possible moment, how convenient.  Sure he thought that having a baby with Bella could never happen but considering that Bella is his world, you would think that he would be more observant to her \\"supposed\\" signs of pregnancy.  This whole story line made the vampires look completely stupid, Carlisle an accomplished doctor did not see that the Vampbabyneeded blood until Edward hears it in Jacobs mind.  This could have been handled so much better if she had spent a little more time on details and thinking through how the characters would react.  They all seemed OOC.      Also isn't a vampire made through a bite, not created through intercourse?  That still doesn't make sense to me.      The name Reneseme is also an atrocious name and the nickname is even worse.  How is Nessie even close to Renesme?  I will give Meyer credit though; I thought that the child had cute characteristics if her situation wasn't so strange.  Growing at a rapid rate mentally and physically was such a convenient plot point for the Jacob imprinting.      I really don't have an issue with imprinting in general, just the fact that Jacob imprinted on Bella's kid.  I actually found the Quil/Claire story line very sweet.  The issue that I have with this imprinting is that Meyer states through Jacob's narrative that he had fantasized about Bella naked and most likely in sexual situations.   She then has him imprint on Nessie, her daughter, which is just creepy to me.  Why Bella's kid? Why not Leah? (I feel bad for that poor girl; she got shafted if you ask me.)    The whole birth scene was disgusting.  Having not given birth myself, but having seen my sister's, I know that I can't physically understand the pain that can occur.  However that scene was just gruesome, it read like something out of Aliens.  To have that in a YA novel was very surprising to me.  I had to put it down for awhile when I was reading that scene.  The writing style and the amount of information that was occurring in the scene were very hectic and hard to follow.      The \\"epic\\" battle that was supposed to occur was a major disappointment.  The Volturi stalled and talked way too much for my taste.  After Irina's death, I wanted to see her sister's attack just to get some action.  I was expecting action like in Eclipse, not talk.  Also why did she have Garrett, a character that was recently introduced at the end of the novel and some one who the audience has no emotional connection with, give such an impassioned speech against the Volturi.  It just didn't fit.  The whole love shield was ridiculously used.  It would have been better if the shield had been used sparingly, not the whole time they were waiting to fight.  It made it to convenient.  It would have been better if Bella could suddenly able to master it when those she loved were in danger at the last moment, not the whole time.        The whole book was very rushed.  I missed the interacting between Edward and Bella and the Cullen family, especially Alice.  She made it seem like she was trying to make everyone's dreams come true, the E/B marriage, the transformation, having Jacob in her life, living happily ever after, having Bella's parents in the loop, ect. ect.  It just didn't work because those things don't fit all together according to her other books.  She did not set the other books up to have all of these things.  That is why this book is all over the place.     And of course I realize this is fiction and not reality.  I am a fan of a happy ending so I have not issue with that I actually prefer it.  I just wish that she had stuck with what she set up in the other 3 books.  If she didn't want to have Bella have to choose and make sacrifices, she should have not set it up to make her fans see it as so.  I am still very shock about the content of this book.  I was really looking foreword to this book and was greatly disappointed.
031606792X|5.0|**Minimal spoilers, you've been warned**    I bought the book at Wal-Mart at around 3am Saturday morning on my way home from partying with my best friend (who lives ridiculously far away), and once home I promised myself I'd just go to bed.  And then I promised myself I'd only read one chapter.  500-some pages later, it was almost lunch time and I was late for getting ready for a bridal shower. Ooops.  Once I'd finished making my appearances at a couple different functions, I got home at 7 and finished the book.  I loved it.  Yes, the triangle did seem to sew up rather neatly with the imprinting, but it didn't bother me...I'm just hoping Meyer will eventually write a book about Renesmee when she's fully grown so I can see Jacob finally get his perfect love, too.  I wasn't a Team Edward or Team Jacob sort of person - I love both characters, but I did think she belonged with Edward - but if I got to choose between the two, I would have wanted Jacob myself.  He's my sort of guy.    Anyway, I didn't think the writing was different or poorly executed.  I didn't notice anything about the writing...I was too immersed in the story.  I really ENJOYED the middle section, getting into Jacob's head.  I'd like to read more from his point of view.    I think the problem some fans are really having is that they spent SO much time imagining and obsessing over what would happen and how it would end that when they finally found out what the writer did with it, they were upset about the choices that were made.  I just got into the series in June, so I read all the books pretty close together, and it is my impression that they all fit together seamlessly.  The only criticism I had was that the \\"Bella Books\\" in the novel each had a chapter index and the \\"Jacob Book\\" did not.  I didn't like not knowing how far away the next POV change would be.    That's it!  Brava, Stephenie...I cannot wait for Edward's POV in your next book!
B00005JM02|5.0|I absolutely love this movie and it my favorite Pixar movie to date.  The colors are fabulous, the storyline is good and the voice over actors are really good.  I'm not a huge fan of Ellen DeGeneres but she does a wonderful job as Dory.  This is also a movie that adults will enjoy just as much as the kids do.  This one also can be used as a teaching tool (consequences of not listening to parent, parent not listening to child, etc.)  Highly recommended to all.
6305971935|3.0|We enjoyed seeing this again. We'd not seen it for years.  It's good viewing and will be good for our collection.
031606792X|5.0|I have to admit that when I started reading Breaking Dawn, I had the same assumptions many readers had about what they \\"thought\\" was going to happen in the final installment of the Twilight Saga.  I couldn't have been more wrong in my predictions, and after giving it a lot of thought, I am happy that Stephenie Meyer surprised us all.    Like many other readers, I was not immediately happy with Bella's pregnancy.  I think we wanted more \\"Edward and Bella happy time.\\"  But, haven't we had tons of that sort of happy time in the rest of the novels?  The pregnancy gave us the opportunity to see these two characters morph from young adults to adults as they are faced with some pretty difficult decisions.  If this novel was simply another one focused on their battle to stay together, it would be a repeat of the first three (although we all now how much we loved that battle.)    I think it is ridiculous that some readers are upset about Jacob imprinting on Nessie.  I think those readers are the ones who need to get their heads out of the trashcan.  These are books about fantasy,  and imprinting is part of the fantasy world.  We should be happy Jacob found his SOMEDAY match.  We should all know that Edward would not let him step foot in the house if Jacob had disturbing thoughts.    Overall I am very happy with Breaking Dawn.  I am glad we had the opportunity to get to know Bella the vampire and also were able to read a book that wasn't a carbon copy of the first three.      Good job Stephenie Meyer.
031606792X|3.0|** Spoilers** (Sorry, I can't help myself.)    For me, this book should have ended on page 360.  Or at the end of Eclipse.   It was as if Meyer ignored the fact that the first three books were based on the love triangle between Bella, Edward, and Jacob.  This book had none of that!  The decision was made at the end of Eclipse and there was nothing to do with it in Breaking Dawn.  A better book for me would have been to start out with more of Jacob trying to stop the wedding and then go on with the book's pages 1 - 360.  The last chapter of Jacob's book had everything I desired...agony, love, loss...and more.  The last page of Jacob's book was thought provoking (I had to read it twice to realize what Jacob had just done) while also giving 95% of the fans what they wanted for Bella.  To go on was just wasteful.  While reading the last half of the book, I felt like my mind was literally saying \\"Blah, Blah, Blah\\".        I could easily tell that Meyer wrote this after (or too close to writing) The Host. Too much filler, like she was trying to hard.  It seems like she couldn't get her head back in the game after writing her \\"adult novel.\\" Like with The Host, I forced myself to finish reading in hopes of an amazing ending.  Meyer prides herself on being an amazing storyteller, but she went too far with this one.  A good book will end while still leaving something to the reader's imagination, as did the first three Twilight novels.  This book left little to be desired.  I give it three stars only because I enjoyed the first half.
B00005K9LN|4.0|this was the album that they started wearing leather it's funny now thinking back on it and rob halford got the leather from gay shops in alley ways in england it's from the gay lifestyle no metal head new back than and wore the studs and the leather great tunes on this one the newly remastered one has red, white, and blue as an extra track which is a patrioc song for england yes their flag is red white and blue also.
031606792X|5.0|This book was more than I could have ever imagined. It was impossible to put down and not once was I disappointed.
031606792X|3.0|I didn't hate it, I love a happy ending, it was just a bit bizzare. I would have done things differently, and the one the biggest dissapointment was no real battle. I loved how the other books all built up to some type of drama but this one was good just fizzled out in the end.
031606792X|3.0|I can agree with some of the reviews in here, but I also have to disagree in some ways.  I never thought that being completely in love with someone was immature I think everyone has their own Edward that they never get over.  I also think that Bella was way more mature than everyone else she goes to school with.  Isn't that what the book is constantly saying too?  I do think that the fourth book was a complete let down.  While in your head you wanted it all to happen that way I still think that it should have been a little more difficult.  Saying this I still couldn't put the thing down, but I only think it's cause I was expecting it to get better and I had to figure out the end!Which was also very dissapointing.  I think that the entire time you want Jacob to react more and you want Edward and Bella to be more Lovey Dovey!  It definitly wasn't the best of the series by any means!
031606792X|1.0|Firstly, I have read Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse. So I know what I'm talking about.      This entire book, reads like either a 13-year-olds Fanfiction, or a disney movie script.    The book has contradictions to what the author has said about Vampire procreation, pedophilic undertones that are presented in a positive light, Mary Sue and Gary Stu characters and plot devices, the portrayl that as long as a girl has a man and a kid, thats all that should make you happy.    Bella is given everything she ever wanted without making any of the sacrifices that one is supposed to make when choosing a 'forbidden love'. Not to mention that the reader is constantly reminded how special Bella is by making her not have to go through the hardships that come with being a newborn Vampire, even though everyone else had to have them. She also basically is the one that protects and defeats the Volturi because the power that 'Special and Perfect Bella' develops is the only one able to save everyone.    She is also apparently stronger than Edward. She's immune to bloodlust, despite her having to supposed to go berserk when in contact with blood.    She set feminism back a hundred years when she began begging Edward for sex. Not to mention the author portrays her as a sex-crazed eighteen year old boy. She constantly wants to sex-it-up with Edward, and not just in this book. She, once again is frequently describing Edward's beautiful-adonis-God-like-etc, etc.    Moving on to her daughter, who turns out to be even more of a Mary Sue than her mother. The kid has super-mental-powers in the womb, she begins to grow at an exponential rate where she will conveniently stop aging at about 18, she can read, can talk and has the mental capacity of an adult, she can copy the moves of others perfectly, and is able to walk, run and even hunt. Also, since all the members of the Quiletes come to instantly like her, all is well between the Vampires and Werewolves.    She sounds like that girl from The4400. Nessie is also a Damphir, you know, like Blade, or BloodRayne, or Connor from Angel. Only, they are actually depthful characters that have flaws, Nessie does not. If no one can see what a Mary Sue this child is, I feel very sorry for you.    Moving on, Jacob imprints on Nessie...........I can not even begin to say how creepy and wrong that is. Also, how is it possible that the reason why Jacob fell in love with Bella was because he knew that she was going to give birth to Nessie? That's taking the 'love' concept ridiculously out of range. I liked Jacob, he deserved a better ending, considering him having to endure Bella's blatant rejection.    My last issue, aside from the poor writing and cliche'd situations and predictable plot devices, is the underlying message of the book, that a lot of fans don't or refuse to see, is that the book portrays happiness for a teenage girl whose straight out of high school as having a man in your life and having his child as soon as possible.    It's as if the author thought the only way to make it a true happy ending was to make sure that Bella had a child, probably because the author has kids of her own and felt if fitting for her character despite how young she is or what kind of message she might be sending to her young readers.    I think the only thing I agreed with, was the explaination that the Werewolves were not actually wolves, but Shapeshifters. This, makes sense, because a lot of indian myths are centered around not werewolves, but SkinWalkers, which are also called Shapeshifters.    Overall, I only enjoyed very little in this entire book, why her editor thought it should be published, I'll never know.
031606792X|4.0|Breaking Dawn is every bit as entrancing, cheesy, far fetched, lovely, intriguing, and delightful as any of the other 3 books in the Twilight Saga. Instead of complaining about a happy ending, fans should rejoice that they got one. If the book had ended sourly people would still be complaining. Competent readers of the first three books will love Breaking Dawn, for it possess the same narrative, character development, attention to detail, and observations about Edward's perfection that we have all come to love. So my message to disgruntled fans is: Get over it! it's a BOOK, that YOU didnt write. Her message was the same throughout all the books, that people are good, they can change, and love can prevail over all.     I applaud Stephenie Meyer for writing the story she wanted to tell, we are just lucky enough to experience it too.
6304806434|3.0|This is a well-made, very watchable example of a classic Hollywood genre -- the action/adventure film. Nicholas Cage plays Cameron Poe, ex-army Ranger who gets in a bar fight and kills a redneck who was bugging his wife. Poe ends up with a plea-bargained eight-year sentence, does his time without annoying anyone, and is about to be released when he's put on a Federal Bureau of Prisons airplane (known as \\"Jailbird-1\\")as a convenient ride back to his hometown. The plane is otherwise filled with the worst of the worst convicts from around the country, who are being shipped to a new super-max prison -- and they have no intention of going. John Malkovich does a terrific job as Cyrus Grissom, ringleader of the escape plot, and John Cusack is also very good as U.S. Marshal Larkin, whose plane it is, and who has to try to prevent the escape, and who establishes a tenuous alliance with Poe -- because Poe is the heroic type and he just can't let things happen this way. Steve Buscemi plays a creepy, Hannibal Lector-ish serial killer whom even the other convicts are nervous about, but the screenwriter and the director missed the chance to do a lot more with him as a \\"wild card.\\" (Would he really have sided with the escaped cons in the Big Showdown?) The plot accelerates as it predictably progresses, with the plane finally crash-landing on the Las Vegas Strip (neat SFX, though not really believable). And while you know the Good Guys are going to win, it's interesting to see how they manage it. Actually, the only bad part of the film is Cage's dreadful attempt at an Alabama accent.
031606792X|1.0|I am embarassed that I was so excited for this book to come out.  I am embarassed that I spent my Friday night at a bookstore waiting for this.  Breaking Dawn completely ruined the entire series.  It was boring, completely off from the rest of the stories, and just all too \\"happy\\" for me to want to stomach.  Not only does Bella get immortality, Edward, a child, Jacob as a best friend again, but she also gets Charlie in her life.  He just has a \\"on a need to know basis\\" claus in their relationship.  What was Mrs. Meyer thinking when she wrote this?  I am utterly disapointed.
B0000931QA|1.0|How is it possible that such an abysmal sounding re-mastering job could have gotten past the members of Queensryche and the label? Mindcrime is, in my opinion, the greatest metal CD of the entire 80s, and was due for a re-mastering to take advantage of today's superior A/D conversions and dynamics...unfortunately, it sounds worse than the original: there is a lot of clipping, and in an effort to make the CD as loud as everything else out there right now, many of the dynamics that make the original such a masterpiece are gone.<br /><br />Stick with the original CD if you have it or can find it; the re-mastered version is useless to anyone with good ears.
031606792X|5.0|First of all, I want to preface this by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed the book. I avoided the Internet like the plague until I finished reading last night and I formed my opinion before it could be tainted by some of the reviews here. I respect everyone else's opinion, but I have to say that I was surprised to see all the negative energy being directed at the book. Stephenie should be so proud of Breaking Dawn! Instead of the traditional review, I will include a list of likes and dislikes.    LIKES    1. I was perhaps one of the few people who did not want Bella to be changed into a vampire because I feared that she would be transformed into an entirely different person. But Stephenie did such a good job keeping Bella's character intact. This leads me to my second point.     2. I loved that Bella was able to avoid/control her lust for human blood. One of the things I had been worried about Bella being changed was that she would be like all the other newborns. It was definitely a good choice for her to be able to avoid it!    3. Stephenie couldn't have resolved the Edward, Bella, Jacob love triangle better than she did. I was so happy that Bella and Jacob were finally able to enjoy a mutual platonic love, while Jake found the person he was truly meant to be with. Renesmee and Jacob being together makes so much sense.     4. I enjoyed the consistency of all the characters. It is entirely plausible that Charlie would prefer to be on a \\"need to know basis\\" regarding the supernatural. All that would matter to him was that Bella was safe. Edward's desperation during Bella's pregnancy was also very in-character. Bella was DYING. Of course he would resort to any means of keeping her alive! I'm guessing he would not have wanted to murder the child under any other circumstance unless his love was dying.    5. I was so glad that Rosalie's high degree of dislike for Bella was resolved. Although it was clear that she had ulterior motives (the baby), in the end, she and Bellawere on good terms, which made me smile. Now the Cullens can truly be a happy family.     6. While I was reminded by J.K. Rowling's Albus Severus blunder, I thought the name \\"Renesmee\\" was beautiful and ingenious. It represented the love and devotion Bella had for both her biological and in-law mothers. The middle name of \\"Carlie\\" is the same. I'm glad the name Bella chose for her child wasn't meaningless like many names are.     7. Probably my favorite part of the entire book was the fact that there was no \\"epic battle.\\" Prior to the book's release, many Twilighters were abuzz about which characters might be killed off. I thought of Alice and Edward and Bella and Jake and Carlisle and all the characters I had grown to love, and dreaded Stephenie taking any of them away. Stephenie showed us that there doesn't need to be war; there can be peace. She showed us the power of words and how they helped divert a raging, devastating war. I felt that the book could not have had a truly \\"happy ending\\" unless all the family was intact, and it was.     8. I LOVED Jacob's book. Although I had become quite accustomed to Bella's POV, Jake's was refreshing and also humorous. I really enjoyed the easing up of tension in a very serious situation (Bella's pregnancy). The chapter names were also hilarious! So Jacob.    9. Garret. He was a minor character, but I thought he was funny and I liked the idea of he and Kate together. I also enjoyed Alistair's mumblings. :P    10. The fact that the werewolves and vampires were able to reach a truce and also gain a lot of friendship. I loved how Bella at first, and then Renesmee were able to bring the two opposing clans together. They learned tolerance.    11. Charlie and Sue having each other. Charlie and Sue had both lost their spouses (Charlie to Phil and Sue to death) and were lonely. I felt bad for Charlie in the past when Bella thought that he had never really gotten over Renee. Charlie deserved a companion, especially because his daughter and grandchild were not human.    12. This is general, but Stephenie's growth as a writer really showed up in the book. After reading The Host, I knew that Breaking Dawn was going to have phenomenal writing, and it did! I am really excited to read everything else she writes in the future.     DISLIKES    1. I found a few grammatical errors here and there (for example, putting neither/or instead of neither/nor), but nothing major. I also noticed that she alternated between saying \\"blonde\\" and \\"blond.\\" Again, not really that big of a deal.     2. The inclusion of the J. Jenks storyline. I completely understood its relevance (Bella would have to have a plan for Renesmee to escape, especially because she thought she and Edward would die). I suppose I felt that it was unnecessary because there didn't end up being a battle. On the other hand, we as readers would not have been able to believe in the danger of the battle unless Bella was completely prepared for the worst outcome.    3. It bothered me a little bit that Bella became so desperate for sex with Edward while she was still human that she was reduced to tears and even offered to postpone being changed. However, I can see the necessity of this, as well. Bella feared that she would not be able to express her love for Edward for years in her crazed newborn phase, so it makes sense that she would be upset about him only letting 'it' happening once when she was human.    4. I need to re-read the book again to get a clear idea of exactly how it was that Edward impregnated Bella. I am guessing that vampires and humans having sex is very rare because they are usually too overcome by bloodlust to \\"get the job done.\\" So, I suppose that isn't even a specific dislike; just a need for clarification.    Breaking Dawn was an excellent novel that left me smiling and hoping. The writing was superb and I thought the book was very fitting as the end to the amazing saga. Bravo, Stephenie!
031606792X|1.0|SO tragic.  I am HUGE fan of the first three works.  I have addicted almost every woman that I came in contact with.  We loved laughed and shared these books together.  So what happened here?  To me it seems that Steph RAN OUT OF TIME, rushed through and may have even had some help from a few ghost writers to help her  out.  However, the end product is NOTHING like its predecessors.  It's jumbled and incomplete.  Strangeness aside, it didn't tie up anything.    For  years we have been waiting to see Bella changed.  So when she becomes a kick-a** vampire, I get one lousy chapter of it?  (I lOVED \\"First HUNT\\").    She also introduces all of these wonderful new vampire characters and does nothing with them.  For all of the hype about the Volture, to just send them away without any awesome displays of power is SO disappointing!  We don't even get to see any of those unique talents shown?    And finally, the real clincher, the books ends FOUR PAGES AFTER THAT!!!!  Are you kidding me?  For all of the wait and the longing with this story, to end like that is a shame.  A damn shame.  PLEASE STEPH!!! Stop the touring, and sit down someday and REALLY write this book they way YOU wanted to.  Give us the alternate ending with a big ol' fight and LOTS of character development.  End the greatest love story of our time they way it should be done.  I'd buy THAT again.  AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, I'd wait many years for it to be crafted.  Take the time to do it right and do it yourself.    I still love you!
031606792X|5.0|It was nothing like I expected but everything I wanted to happen. I loved it.
031606792X|5.0|****SPOILERS****    I cannot believe the number of 1 star reviews over this book. The entire series was FICTION people, I mean seriously. It was about a vampire, a shape shifting wolf & his pack!!!! How much more make believe could it be guys.     That being said, I think Breaking Dawn was perfect. Why does there need to be some big moral lesson for young girls in a fiction book? Get over it people.     I'm not sure how everyone is saying that there was no plot, the last three books built up PERFECTLY to this book. It all makes perfect sense. I know a lot of people are upset about Jacob and Nessie but it again is, perfectly plotted story line! Meyer's totally built up to this point. I love that Jacob wasn't actually in love with his best friend, he was drawn to her because he was waiting (unknowingly) for Nessie. I just loved it.     I loved every ounce of this story! Fantastically written, magically entertaining and a must read if you're not off the deep end worrying about what teenage girls might take from a vampire romance... note VAMPIRE ROMANCE.    Will definitely leave you with a warm fuzzy feeling and sigh of relief for all your favorite characters!
B0002XMF4Y|5.0|I love The Mob Rules record. IMHO it's far and away the best Dio-era record. It features gold standards like Sign of the Southern Cross and Over & Over. It also contains my favorite Dio era song : Falling Off the Edge of the World.    Dio's lyrics are very good. The Wizards and Magic theme is nicely contained with other themes throughout the record. Martin Birch's production is exactly what you'd expect from him. A fine clean record.    I don't know why it gets such a bad reputation compared to H&H. H&H had this line-ups classics but The Mob Rules is a fantastic album from start to finish. It's easily a nice progression from this record to Dehuminizer.    I highly recommend this record, especially this version, the Castle remaster.
031606792X|5.0|This book was a captivating love story that really tipped off the series. I loved every aspect of this book. It was ten times MORE addicting than all the other books in the series (though each of them were wonderful), and just as satisfying... possibly more. There is not a book better than this one. It had everything that I was hoping for and more!
B000068OCS|4.0|Very different and artistic film. This film is an excellent example of telling a story through other means than those used in conventional cinema today.
031606792X|4.0|I'm fairly new to the Twilight series and have now ready all four books w/in a period of 2 months.  I was immediately hooked and loved all the characters Stephenie Meyer created for this saga.<br /><br />I am disappointed in some of the critiques I've been reading and can't believe how harsh some of the readers have been over a fictional story.  Fictional stories are written so that the reader can escape their real life and just get into a good book.  I don't believe the intent that Stephenie had was to try and teach life lessons through Bella, Edward, or Jacob or to claim to be an expert in vampire biology so to rudely say that Breaking Dawn is going to teach readers that there's always a happy ending to life w/o struggles is harsh.  Let's remember that Stephenie was creating a romantic story... a fantasy world... for HER entertainment ultimately, and was kind enough to share her story with all of us.<br /><br />Personally, I quite enjoyed every facet of Breaking Dawn, as well as books that preceded it.  I was shocked at some of the twists and turns, and ecstatic over the happy ending.  There are enough sad endings in REAL LIFE that getting a happy ending in this book was a real treat!
B0013FSL3E|3.0|I couldn't wait to see Wall.e at the theater and I was very disappointed. I am sorry to say that, in my opinion, it was just not a very good movie. The robots were cute but the story line really sucked. The scenario happens in the future and people have made so much trash that Manhattan is literally a trash dump, as is the rest of earth. The people who were left were transported to a space station where they have been living for the last 700 years. They do nothing but lay on lounge chairs and are transported around all day.  They even drink their food in shakes, so they don't even have to chew. They are all weight-callenged (like maybe 500 lbs). If they fall off the lounge chair a robot has to pick them up because their muscles have all atrophied and they cannot get up or walk. Their feet and legs are swollen and their feet look like little balloons. Obviously, there are health and environmental messages here, and I guess that was the intent of the flick. I think the movie was trying to say that if we don't wake up, this is what will happen.<br /><br />Apparently periodic surveilance is done by sending a robot to Earth to look for evidence of plant life.  Finally, the visiting robot found a plant on earth.  That means the earth is now capable of sustaining life again and the people can return home. I like the attempt at the health and environmental issues but the movie is slow and boringly done. I almost fell asleep twice, which is pretty unusual for me, especially on an empty stomach. Two thumbs down on this review, I am sorry to say, because I love Disney and the Pixar movies.  Wall.e stands for Waste Allocation something and he is an adorable trash compactor.  He is self-contained with the personality of an adorable and lonely little child and he reminds you of the Short Circuit robot of previous movies.  The visiting robot is Eva, so you can guess that Wall.e gets the robot-hots for her.  The movie is safe for your young children to see. I just think that Disney could have done so much more with the story-line.have done so much more with the story-line.
031606792X|5.0|If you are a fan of the Twilight saga, and truely care for the characters in it, then you will be pleased with this book. It was very well written by Stephenie Meyer, and keeps to the integrity that this book had from the very start of Twilight. It sucks you in from the very beginning, and leaves you craving to read more...yet satisfied in the end.    Anyone who has gotten on here & reviewed the book as something less than 4 stars has a pole up their you know where... Some people are dissapointed that things might have been wrapped up in a neat little bow, because it wasn't true to how \\"life really is\\", but tell me this. How can it be real life? It's about VAMPIRES! Excuse me for wanting things to end up happy in a fantasy book. Especially since that happens not so often here in the \\"real world\\".
031606792X|5.0|I wouldn't say this is my favorite book in the series, but this is just such a good book. It was well written (like I've come to expect from Stephenie) and it took the series to an end that I never even expected. That's in a good way. I was so enthralled I was basically in a trance reading this book all at once in one day. I had to keep going. I couldn't put it down. I was so scared an nervous about the series ending crappily and to me, it ended better than I hoped it could. I got everything I wanted out of it and more. Sure there were parts where I was really shocked, surprised, confused, angry, grossed out, sad, and worried, but that was the point. I felt the emotions of the characters right along with them. I won't give spoilers, but I really truly do love this book and I could not have thought of a better end for the story I have come to know and love so much.
031606792X|1.0|Breaking Dawn is the much-anticipated conclusion to the Twilight series from Bella, the narrator of the other three published books, point of view. It suceeds bestsellers TWilight, New Moon, and Eclipse.    In Twilight we are introduced to Bella as her mother is dropping her off at an airport, where Bella is board a plane to the rainy town of Forks, Washington to live with her dad. Her motivation, it is later revealed, is to allow her mother greater opportunity to move around with her new husband, who is a minor league baseball player. It's not long before Bella is drawn to the sexy, reclusive Cullens - a coven of older teenagers described as seductively beautiful outsiders. Apparently, the attraction is mutual and she is soon approached by the chivalrous Edward. Their 'relationship' soon mounts in intensity, and Bella is unofficially integrated into the Cullen family. Twilight is followed by New Moon, where Edward leaves her \\"for her own good\\" after an accident involving a paper cut and broken bones, thus opening a window of opportunity into which Jacob, a Native American from a local reservation and Bella's childhood friend, quickly steps. Like every other fertile man in Forks, Jacob quickly falls for Bella - a fact which, in addition to the appearance of werewolves within the reservation, complicates the relationship between the two central characters in the third book, Eclipse. This, then, quickly builds to encompass territorial disputes between the two mythological creatures (coincidentally, vampires and werewolves are mortal enemies), as well as an approaching army, headed by the bitter vampire girlfriend of Twilight's villain. Eventually, all the conflicts are brought to a close - the evil vampires are bested by cooperation between the Cullens and the werewolves, Bella acknowledges but denies her love for Jacob, and Edward and Bella end up engaged.    And this is where Breaking Dawn picks up - the book opens on Bella in a new car, reflecting on her impendingwedding. Through the first few chapters, the reader is fully subject to alternating bouts of angst, low self-esteem, idolatry based on Edward's utter perfection, and uncertainty about the wedding. However, this 'conflict,' like all others in the Twilight universe, is quickly absolved as soon as Bella is fitted in her wedding dress and sees her gorgeous husband-to-be. From here, Meyer proceeds with the wedding and then a swift transition to the happy honeymoon, where, after two books of repressed lust, Bella and Edward finally consummate their relationship. Unfortunately, it turns out that Edward is still fertile, thus leading to an unexpected (and potentially unhealthy) pregnancy.    Directly after the tumultuous conclusion of the happy couple's not-so-happy honeymoon, Meyer switches point of view to Jacob - the bitter ex-almost-boyfriend who harbors an acute grudge against Edward which, somehow, extends to the rest of the Cullens. After a solid block of angst and forbidden lust, Bella goes into a very violent and bloody labor with her demon spawn, at the end of which, in conclusion to Jacob's turn at narration, he \\"imprints\\" (the creepy werewolf equivalent to \\"love at first sight\\") on Bella's barely-born mutant baby.    From here, Bella picks the narration back up and the reader is subjected to a clumsy definition of what it is to be turned into a vampire. Meyer, apparently, knows no other way to describe it than having fire (the magical venom that has replaced all of the normal bodily fluids in vampires) running through her veins - which is how she illustrates it for an entire chapter. Bella has been hastily turned after her painful delivery to save her life (in a sense, at least). The story quickly dissolves into poorly disguised wish-fulfillment, featuring a cottage in the woods, a beautiful baby, an effortless transition to life as a vampire, superhuman strength of will, and ridiculously awesome sex. At the end, Meyer, much like in Twilight, throws in some contrived conflict featuring evil Italian vampires - all culminating in a thoroughly unthrilling action sequence suceeded by an excruciatingly gooey epilogue.    In Breaking Dawn Meyer continues in her proud tradition of poor storytelling, fully outfitted in amateurish prose, holey plot, and spotty conflict. As in the three prior books in this proclaimed \\"saga,\\" she builds a shaky structure, which she then proceeds to slather with an excess of sweet, and unrealistic, nothings between her two lovers. The universe is built around her characters (a typical trait in poorly written fanfiction) - the world reacts to them, instead of them reacting to the universe. The plot is built around the whims of her characters, all of whom are startlingly one-dimensional, and furthered by a series of unexplained and illogical coincidences. At times, Meyer even sees fit to directly contradict both the laws she's set up for her universe as well as the rules of science and logic. Bella is impregnated by Edward, but this should be impossible both because all of Edward's sperm should have died and, according to the laws of Meyerpires, all of his remaining sperm should have been turned into vampire venom.    Furthermore, the same misogyny is on full display throughout the narrative. Although Bella, through her transformation to a vampire, has become less physically helpless, she displays the same weakness of mind and character that was her single defining characteristic throughout her story. Similarly, the surrounding female characters, such as Esme, Alice, Rosalie, Leah, and Renee, have been weakened even more to compensate for the minimal improvement on Bella's part. Alice, once a promising and interesting character, is reduced to a shallow, superficial, weak character with the mindset and attention span of a slightly below average teenager, despite her century-long lifespan. Esme, similarly, is depicted as a stereotypical housewife, her mind entirely absorbed with decoration and housekeeping. Rosalie, the only character not actively depicted as evil to express dislike for Bella, is shown as a bitter, hard-hearted, jealous bitch who cares only for the opportunity to care for a baby that she was robbed of with her transformation to a vampire - similarly, Leah, the only female werewolf, is depicted as a lovelorn and physically inferior harpy who only expresses care for her brother and her violent, cheating ex-boyfriend Sam, the head werewolf. Renee, Bella's flighty, inconsistent mother, is given little attention but is shown as negatively as ever.    Stephenie Meyer has repeatedly proven herself to be a technically inept amateur writer who, intentionally or not, pumps her cheap stories with dubious moral and intellectual messages. In that respect, this book does not disappoint. The action is frighteningly tame, her characters are sexist, her romance is clumsy and forced, and her writing is as novice as ever. Breaking Dawn is a complete failure of a book, not even good for a few cheap laughs because of the seemingly endless stream of insipid narration the reader is subjected to for over seven hundred pages.
031606792X|5.0|When I first started reading the book, I had read some of the spoilers so I knew what to expect.  I thought I would hate it.  The whole idea seemed quite ridiculous to me, and I did dislike it to a point...then it changed.  It was around book 3 that I realized just how phenomenal an author Stephenie Meyer is.  Yes, she didn't write it so all her fans would be happy (how boring would it have been if it was written like I expected) and she took risks yet it worked.  I loved it.  She took a character (Bella) who hadn't changed over three books and had her come into her own by experiencing something that no one can truly understand until they are one-maternal love.  She broke her characters into pieces, then put them back together again in a way that actually fit with her previous books.    Anyone who has read any of the other books would have seen some of the things coming-Nessie anyone?  There were so many hints about Bella giving up motherhood that it shouldn't have come as a surprise that she does get to be a mother.  Yes, she does become a mother, but she certainly has to suffer for it.  The Jacob/Bella relationship is also fully explained.    I will admit Renesmee is a stupid name, yet who are we to tell the author what the names are going to be.  Maybe she likes it?  I would say that plenty of people name their children stupidly every day.    I won't go off anymore, but to anyone reading the reviews and deciding whether to read it or not, I'd say go for it.  Its not typically what you'd expect after reading the other books, but it is brilliant.  REad it and form your own opinions-that's what I did even knowing the spoilers beforehand.  You won't be disappointed.
B000XZTGB6|3.0|When I checked the BelAir website I discovered that the Hector Berlioz item on this DVD `Harold in Italy' was not just the Finale (as noted on the DVD cover) but the entire work, I had to purchase the disk. For many years, the CD version by Colin Davis and the London Symphony Orchestra with Tabea Zimmermann (viola soloist) has been a favorite of mine, and I have been looking for a DVD version for some time.<br /><br />I went straight to this particular title and immediately found that while Yuri Bashmet is a good musician, his performance in this concert was not in the same class as Ms. Zimmermann. I was also amazed that, for a filmed concert, there was audience applause after the second movement. This was not just by a handful of concertgoers who did not know the work, but a significant portion of the audience. Mr. Bashmet's performance was certainly not one that warranted applause at that point. He tackled the next movement with more confidence and once again, to my utter amazement, the audience applauded. I think that some of the responsibility for this might have been that Valery Gergiev's pauses between movements were slightly longer than necessary. This is a work that needs to be listened to without significant interruption with each movement flowing on from the one before. Although the overall performance was not too bad, in terms of listening pleasure it was certainly a disappointment.<br /><br />Moving on to other works on the program, the Overture to Ruslan and Ludmilla was played as precisely and briskly as on the complete opera DVD by the same orchestra and conductor; which is to say somewhat faster than we are used to hearing it on the concert stage. I particularly enjoyed Liszt's Piano Concerto #2 (with Yefim Bronfman soloist), Verdi's Overture to La forza del destino and the Strauss Polka; but was disappointed with some of the other selections, as I prefer not to listen to short snippets of works that are more familiar in their entirety.<br /><br />The booklet notes that the acoustic consultant for the new Mariinsky Theatre Concert Hall was the same person responsible for the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. This certainly contributes to the very good audio quality of this DVD.<br /><br />A word needs to be said of the video direction by Chlo&eacute; Perlemuter who seems to have very little talent or experience in directing concerts of this type. I thought Herbert von Karajan was bad with his hogging of the camera but at least when the Berlin Philharmonic played you were shown groups of instrumentalists in addition to the conductor. Ms. Perlemuter tried to get Valery Gergiev in almost every shot that is on the screen. If he doesn't fill the screen completely, he is almost always to be found in the center of the picture - somewhere. Camera vantage points were not chosen with regard to showing the musicians, most of whom are shown from the rear and too often arms, heads and instruments interfere or block the picture. It is perhaps unfortunate, considering how much camera time is spent on Mr. Gergiev, that his appearance seemed very untidy. Designer stubble is questionable on any person, but once that person is no longer young and the hair is gray, it just looks very unkempt. He reminded me of a `down-at-the-heels' street performer who had been given someone's discarded dress suit.<br /><br />If it wasn't for the misplaced applause in the Berlioz I would be able to recommend this as an excellent disk to LISTEN to, however, I will continue to wait for other versions of the works I really wanted to see performed well, becoming available.e acoustic consultant for the new Mariinsky Theatre Concert Hall was the same person responsible for the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles.

And Enzo turns out to be a hero, in a gripping passage near the end of the book.  I have given the book to a lady who is able to communicate with animals, and know that she will love it.  RonBryan
031606792X|3.0|Firstly, I love the series and The Author. Despite my feelings about breaking Dawn I still think Meyer is going to write plenty of good books in the future.     However, She fumbled this one immensely.      I would compare this to Stephen kings dark Tower series (if) All of the sudden Stephen had decided to end the series in 4 books instead of 7. Only right up until he went to write the 4th book, he was under the assumption he was going to be writing 3 more books after the 4th one. He thought he had way more time to explain things, to allow characters to develop at a rate which was believable not one which disconnects you from them.      Convulsive? Apologies.      Same comparison works with The harry potter books, If Rowling had stuffed 3 books worth of storyline into a single book of 700 pages and decided her supporting cast of characters didn't matter anymore and suddenly had nothing to say, you would have had the same mess.     Meyer stuffs way way way too much down your throat. Generally so far in the series the main point of the story is the relationships, the characters, they are very crucial to the first 3 books of the series.     Yet in BD, the characters are overrun with plot, The first Story Arch would have been enough for a full length novel, and it should have been. That would have left room for us to spend time with these characters. Instead everything was thrown into overdrive and we reached an imagined ending way before we should have.        Another major problem is the Climax, which is all tricks and illusion. Nothing really happens, Everyone get's their happy ending, no harm befalls anyone we care about. It's all fluffy and amazingly unrealistic.      Of course her series isn't exactly based on fact, of course not. But she has always managed to make it feel as if what's happening, if it really did happen, could happen this way.     Not any more.      She has said she writes for herself, Which is good. An author must please themselves before anyone else. You cannot try and please your audience, you can never make everyone happy.     But Authors also can't just tie everything up like it's all a Disney movie. The story needs to be served. Yes it's hard to let go of characters that you care about. But this turned into a big long piece of fan fiction. I felt like I was reading something from a grade 10 creative writing English assignment.      It's as if she's terrified of continuity.      Alas it could have been amazing, it should have been more then a single book, or one plot should have been cut. We should have heard At least Alice say more then 4 words throughout the entire novel... one of her best characters get's muzzled... Gah.. It's hard to know that this was Bella's last one, at least from her perspective... She deserved better.
031606792X|3.0|If you're picking up Breaking Dawn expecting the same breathless romance of the first three books in the Twilight saga I'm warning you now:  this one is different.  Approach with some caution.  Be prepared to have the fantasy you love very much touched by \\"normal life\\" in such a way that it changes the story completely.  The same cast of characters is back, but they are different:  not as present almost and very nearly stretched out of proportion when they are.  As it is in real life, marriage changes Bella and Edward's romance utterly (as I heard one fan say it, \\"Where's all the 'fluffy' romance?\\"), as do other things.  I've had a day to let Breaking Dawn sink in, and while there are parts I love (Stephenie's  humor is very much in evidence and there are some interesting plot twists), there are also parts I really don't like.  Stephenie almost seems a little off the mark with her characters and there are chunks of the book where, although there are obviously very imporant things going on, the reader is mostly left to their own devices to figure out what those things are.      So be cautioned, dear reader, that while Breaking Dawn neatly ties up many loose threads and brings a conclusion to Bella's story as promised (plus leaves us many other things to consider), it may very well leave you discomfited as well.
031606792X|5.0|I hate that everyone is freaking out about the 'message' behind these books. They are not meant to be lessons, they are stories, and Meyer has said multiple times that she does not write with an audience in mind, she writes for herself and that is one of the reasons I love her. I have read all four of her books, multiple times. I was only disappointed in New Moon (and that was only because I missed Edward.) I know that Breaking Dawn got a bit outlandish but come on, it's pretty much science fiction, vampires and werewolves? How can you complain about it being unrealistic? Of course it's not realistic!<br /><br />I read as a vacation from real life, the life where sacrifices are made, people die and not everyone winds up happy. I read so that I can imagine a world where all of that is not necessarily true. I would have been disappointed if the saga HADN'T ended happily ever after. It was always a fairy tale, a romance between Edward and Bella, and that is just how fairy tales end.<br /><br />It just made me so angry to read the harsh reviews people have left on here, just because the book didn't turn out how they thought it should or would. It was a great work of fiction, as was the rest of the series, well written and intriguing, fantastical, sucking you completely in. We are all entitled to our opinions, I understand that, this is mine. Don't read this book looking for a moral or a lesson, read it to enjoy it, to live for 700-something pages in a world full or werewolves, vampires and happily ever afters.
031606792X|3.0|I'm not sure what to say about this book. I guess my final impression is that it was okay. The first three books were really enjoyable to read, and I couldn't put them down. This one I could definitely put down, and I had a hard time picking it back up again. I was put off by the pages and pages of pointless dialogue -- where was the editor? I think the whole section on Jacob's point of view could have been deleted, and I wouldn't have missed it. I really got tired of his grinding teeth and numerous \\"I hate vampires\\" remarks. The plot really didn't pick up until there was the threat of the Volturi. And even that fizzled out rather quickly. So, it was okay but nothing special.
031606792X|2.0|If you want a book that rekindles the magic of the first three Twilight Saga installments, then BD is not for you.  The characters, especially the most beloved (Bella, Edward and Alice), become stoic and boringly mature overnight.  The youthful vigor and passion is replaced with a less romantic, and much less playful, demeanor.  Loose ends are tied up, but with the knowledge comes disappointment because the forever after is not nearly as wonderful as a Twilight-Eclipse reader would most likely picture it. The story is also depressingly anticlimactic.  After such a long read you hope for a little action, which builds, but is ultimately doused before any real trouble starts.  I suggest reading the first three installments and drawing you own conclusions because this conclusion will not be nearly as satisfying.
B000GLDOXS|5.0|As a Viet Nam veteran I found this movie very realistic and just a bit unnerving.  My time there was more towards the end of the War when we had weapons even more deadly to man than were available at the time of the event in this movie.  I found the character of the Vietnamese units commanding officer very realistic.  Not all were savage and uncaring about the men and in some cases women under their command though some were.  The story presented in the movie did happen and the movie portrays what happened very accurately.

031606792X|3.0|After I read through this book the first time, I gave it an automatic 5 stars. But after reading it again, I must say that I've changed my mind on a few things, even though I still did enjoy it.    *SPOILERS*    The first part, from Bella's perspective, I absolutely loved. The wedding scene was beautifully written, as was the honeymoon scene. Once I realized that Bella was pregnant (while she was cooking the chicken) my first thought was \\"Huh?\\" This should not be possible. And the book went downhill from there.    The next part, from Jacob's perspective, bored me to tears. I actually skipped a section of it. I did like the chance to see into Jacob's brain, but the Edward and Bella portrayed in this section seemed false. And Jacob imprinting on Nessie (don't get me started on the name) was just weird.    The last section, the second time through reading it, is what sunk the rating for me. Everything tied up with a nice big bow, no sacrifices, happily-ever-after, the end. And let's throw a little Volturi in there just to spice it up, but not too spicy! It's got to be nice and neat.    All-in-all, I did enjoy the book, despite all the inconsistencies. I only had to think of it as a piece of fluff, not literature. What can I say? I guess I'm just a sucker for romance.
B0006IIKS0|5.0|A couple years back a film friend of mine put this film on his must-see agenda. He's a documentarian, so I didn't understand how a pop doc could stoke his interest. I said, Yeah, I thought about it, but there were a couple of other movies at the festival that seemed more my style. I liked Metallica, but a doc? I asked him what I thought was the obvious, \\"So you're a Metallica fan?\\"<br />\\"No,\\" he laughed self-consciously. He's not really into metal. He's more into worldbeat, Celtic music, and other esoterica. Some jazz, but not U.S. based. Very much into the international scene.<br />When he gave his feedback after the show, I expected him to give the hardline critical response and tell me at best it was pretty good, maybe overhyped. But his face lit up and burst into enthusiasm, envy, pride. It was so well done, it was just \\"amazing\\" he said. As a doc Director who'd been nominated for an Emmy, that was quite a compliment. He did mention \\"This is Spinal Tap\\" and for me, that kind of killed my interest. I'd seen that movie many many years ago, but it didn't stick in my mind as something that I could still remember years later as something unforgettable in some way.<br /><br />I heard buzz about \\"Some Kind of Monster\\" by a variety of critics, etc., after its initial screening at film festivals nationwide. That it was progressive, like nothing people had seen before, blah blah.<br /><br />I watched \\"Some Kind of Monster\\" when the DVD arrived. I was surprised to see 2 discs, and insert of material.<br /><br />I held my breath for the overhype that was likely fanning the film. Ever the skeptic. A film about a band going thru therapy?<br /><br />But it wasn't really about that. Hour after hour, I was riveted. In the film Lars mentioned it was really about relationships. It was that, and more. My impression of the film up til I sat down, and even listening to my friend's effusions was that it was a documentary about a band. I can't recall the \\"This is Spinal Tap\\" movie, but my recollection is that this is the case of apples and oranges. If the film had been buzzed less about some people going thru therapy than a story about a band family, then I probably would've seen the movie sooner not later. I can relate to that.<br /><br />I watched the film and the bonus CD of outtakes in one whole day. We're talking hours upon hours. It was that riveting, compelling, candid. I bought another CD for a friend who is a long time Metallica fan and occasional guitar player/drums player but he, for some reason, hadn't seen the film. Maybe it was the mention of the band going thru therapy that turned him off.<br /><br />It's an inspiring tale of a family getting their act together and pushing beyond their limits of current excellence and accomplishments. Being vulnerable and open to growing pains. When you're at the top, you don't have to go down. You can expand your horizons. Sometimes the music or your art or whatever you're possessed about possesses you and becomes bigger than the creators. A la Frankenstein or some other non-human machine. You risk being overcome if you don't take control and get grounded. Recover your humanity. For artists, sometimes they can get caught up in the craft, consumed even, even glorified for having been consumed.<br /><br />This was an up-close look into the lives of a family of musicians and how they got their house in order. Healed the parts. Got the humanity back. I don't think I've ever seen such candid, raw exposure like that from giants among us to whom others look up to as larger than life, bigger and better than human. Goliath. Fighting the monsters within them and between them.<br /><br />It was touching and horrible to see the struggles. Viewers could see their own humanity. You hope and pray that the musicians find their way back home. To realize why they came together, the joy in their craft, even in the hard work. Labor of love.<br /><br />It was almost like watching a married couple go thru counseling. We all know or have met people married for years, and are dumbstruck with near horror when we hear that divorce is looming on the horizon as a possible final solution to whatever ails their union. Counseling is no longer the last resort for marriage, it's sometimes a healthy maintenance requirement. As with anything, if you wait til it's nearly too late to make things better, it probably is too late. So for that, it's inspiring to see a family of musicians doing whatever they can to stay together, whether times or good or bad, practice does make perfect, and good habits  like bad ones become hard to break.<br /><br />In the movie, you see the band getting into healthy living. Making peace with some demons. The singer James, you find relief in his having a father figure in his life who's positive after years of being without something he needed. Lars has his father, apparently comes from money, and is very business oriented, practical, so you don't feel a whole lot of sympathy when he's complaining about people not going all out for him on his birthday. He's got the wife, the house, megamil sideline art deals, he had a fully intact family, he was revered and a big fish in a small town, him and his whole family. But James used music to escape and channel emotions. Like so many in the states, music, sports, etc., other creative or athletic activities were something positive avail to even those who had very little. It's almost like a source of hope and faith.<br /><br />Both Lars and James have families-wife and kids. I've heard it said that when men have their own kids, they begin to make peace with their own childhood. They rise to the challenge. If their childhood was less than what they'd like, there's the need to do better by their own kids, for some. And for some who had good childhoods, a need to keep up the legacy.<br />I've heard that in growing up and into their own families, some men will 'put away childish things' and concentrate on their home life. It was incredible to see married men trying to navigate a home life with a lifestyle that's not necessarily home-life friendly. It was touching to see the men include aspects of their home life, their wives, their kids.<br />Being the heroes in their home.<br /><br />With every challenge comes the opportunity to rise above and have a rebirth. Or not. Growing pains. If it takes a long time to develop bad habits, it surely takes some time to undo them. With people all over the world showing support and hope, the Metallica family remains intact, and gives back yet again to its legions of fans, old and new. We're all in this together.

031606792X|1.0|I have to agree with much of the other reviewers here - this book was a huge disappointement.  I am a fanatic when it comes to the Twilight series.  I have read each of the first three books several times, devouring them.  The Twilight series ends here, in this fourth book with a screeching halt.  I honestly felt like I was reading bad fan fiction.  If I had not been a fan of the earlier books and picked this one up, I would have stopped reading after Book I.  Bella pregnant with Edward's child?  (What about the fact that all bodily fluids become venom after you become a vampire?)  I felt like Stephenie Meyer created rules for her world and then broke them.  Another HUGE problem I had was Jacob's imprinting on Bella's child.  What the heck?!  Also, the Volturi just changing their minds and walking away from the brewing battle?  Too clean, too easy.      These books were about true love, sacrifice.  The emotions that I felt in the first three books were intense.  I was able to feel what these beloved characters felt.  During this book, I felt nothing.  I actually didn't even care if Bella or Edward lived!      I love this series, but am sad to think that my memories of the first three books will be tainted by the fourth.
031606792X|5.0|If I read books to learn about real situations that ended badly; I wouldn't read, I'd turn on the news...     Thanks to SM for a magnificent journey and the best warm-fuzzy ending I've read in quite a while (we could use more in real life).     2 days later and I'm still smiling about it.    Thanks.
B000GRUS22|5.0|I love Enigma.  I waited a long time for this album.  No, it's not like the others, but it is, unmistakebly Enigma. A good sound system reveals the characteristic layer upon layer that is Enigma. Cretu continues to add a touch of sound at the exact right moment it is needed in each piece.  Sounds that and notes that are a marvel to me.  Kind of like an artist knowing just where to add a highlight or color.  It is a departure from the earlier stuff, but most of us are too. I even liked Voyageur, though I think it was considerably less subtle and more pop-sounding.  It has less layers, but it is still good.  A Posteriori is a different subject, Earth in space and time.  As a different subject, it is going to sound different.  Monks and ethnic sounds aside, space sounds would be different. This is an expansion, this is future.  As for Jens Gad.  He appears to have moved on somewhat himself.  If you haven't yet, check him out with \\"Jens Gad Presents\\" and his \\"Achillea\\" albums from Sequoia.  He also, has moved in a different direction.  If you want classic Enigma, listen to the older stuff.  If you want Enigma that continues to grow and move into the future--listen to this one too.  Goodbye Milky Way is truly beautiful.  But so are the rest.  As with the other albums, it is hard to listen to just one song.  If you do, you may miss something.  Rather like reading only the ending of a good book.
031606792X|4.0|After a few hours of shock- I've finally come to a point where I can review my experience. Let's face it, with all the hype, could anything be as perfect as we expected? I enjoyed reading BD even if I did guess at some of the plot lines as they appeared. I was a little upset with the miracles of vampire anatomy. (Maybe Dr. Carlisle should write a companion novella about what works and what doesn't?)And appalled at the choice in names!  I, like so many, ached to have a happy ending for Bella and Edward. I also wanted Jacob to find the love and happiness he deserved. In the end it seems as if everyone got exactly what they needed... So no more tears for the family that will live on forever and forever and forever.
031606792X|5.0|***No Spoilers!****    So many negative reviews!  Of course the book doesn't reflect real life.  It's about vampires!!!  People are also upset with some of the changes to the characters personalities, but people do change, that's the beauty of people, we change, we adapt.  I would be upset if Bella was exactly the same in book 4 as she was in book 1.  She's still Bella though, no matter what.  Anyways.... this was a WONDERFUL story.  I'm 25 yrs old and I couldn't put it down and I was so happy to be back in Forks and back in their world.  I finished it last night and am still thinking about the characters and what they go through and can't wait to re-read the story and absorb it at a slower pace to fully enjoy it.  If you enjoy the series for what it is: a purely fantasy story written for teenagers, about teenagers and as long as you don't look for any hidden life message or story or altruistic meaning, you will enjoy this book very much and not want it to end at page 754.
031606792X|1.0|....not really.    SPOILERS      I have to admit that I really just stopped reading and started skimming when Edward tore open Bella's uterus with his teeth. Really.    I don't understand why SMeyer is so adverse to showing sex scenes (each instance was covered with a not-so-subtle FADE TO BLACK, sometimes mid paragraph) but can write a full fledged, bloody birthing scene.     The werewolves were interesting, but that soon turned bitter when Jacob imprinted on a newborn. Never, ever, will I be okay with that. That and the whole notion of free will is sucked out of these books by that notion and by Meyer's unhealthy attitude to women. Women are defined who they're with, not who they are. Every woman wants a baby, and you better damn believe they aren't complete without one.     Sure, it's popcorn lit at its best, but at the same time it's so strangely misogynistic that I can't help but stare. Bella goes on her first hunt in stilettos and in a cocktail dress. That's something I'd expect from Frank Miller, not YA Lit.    No, I take it back. Sorry, Frank. Even you wouldn't sink that low.     The writing itself is.....well. I lost count of the times someone 'murmured' or 'hissed'. Someone find S Meyer a thesaurus.     I couldn't finish reading this, which is sad. Twilight was a better book in its popcorn-lit, but this...between the birth scene and the imprinting...this is disturbing.
031606792X|1.0|We all know that the Twilight series does not claim to be Shakespeare, although the comparisons SM makes may state otherwise, but Breaking Dawn reads like a bad fan fiction. No, I will not insult fan fiction writers like that, because it was much worse than anything they could've come up with.     I'm not going to go on and on about how terrible this book was and what a terrible message SM sends, because most of the other reviewers have done that for me. I'll just say this: Don't read Breaking Dawn unless you want to *facepalm* the entire time.
031606792X|5.0|I am OBESSESED with this saga!! I literally devoured this book in a day and found it delectable and satiating.  I am concerned, however, with the copious amount of negative reviews on the book and I do understand many of their reserves although I do object.   First, many have complained about the lack of reality in the story, how certain things seem impossible such as tumultuous \\"wild ride\\" readers were taken on in a completely unrealistic book to begin with!! it seems contradictory to complain about realism in a fantastical world filled with vampires and werewolves!   Second, many saw the book to have lost the concept of sacrifice on the part of Bella and were deterred by her bearing a child at 18, getting hitched and being sex driven... I can understand their discretion considering the age group targeted by the saga and the influence it may have, however, having a 15 year old sister myself and being a 15 year old once, REALITY holds that these are evident concerns and concepts such an age group is plagued with at this day in age as much as we would rather not grasp the fact. I dont think it is a detrimental influence to their hold on morality or that it is telling them it is okay, but rather an eye opener to the responsibilities that arise from such decisions such as Bella's need to protect Nessie and be the best mother she can be.  It is a huge 180 from my initial impression of her being completely immature.  It shows the growth that comes with responsibility.  Through my own observations of pre-teens who have become pregnant, they fail to understand the responsibilities in order to adapt to our innate maternal nature as women and thus do not exhibit that love and devotion all mothers should feel, as Bella did. Such is evident in young girls that are not pregnant as well as they contemplate doing adult things without an adult conception.  Also, although I do not condone sex among such an audience, we must remember that despite Bella and Edward's urges to be sexually active (Which is involuntary and inevitable at any age) they decided to wait until MARRIAGE before they were active.  Not only did they wait until marriage, but they also chose to marry the person they irrevocably loved and pledged to be together forever in her commitment that was displayed by her willingness to become immortal with him. In this case, I find such to target the actual concerns of those reading the story and be a positive influence rather than a negative one.  Back to her SACRIFICE...even though in the end she hadnt sacrificed anything at all for the sake of a happy ending, I was satisfied with her INTENTION and decision to sacrifice herself if need be because I WOULD NOT be content with an unhappy ending.  Were people rooting for her to die in efforts to preserve the concept of sacrifice in the story??  She still had choices to make as well, but they were resolved by her decision to solely protect her child!  Onto the flattened image of the rest of the characters... I can see what people are complaining about, however, such didnt even occur until the middle of the story when things began to get chaotic.  I actually found this void of the original characters essences to truly feed the tumultuous image of the incidents in my head.  Consider our own responses in the event of a disaster and how we are almost not ourselves.  In this case, the whole family was in danger...each and every one of them had the notion that everyone they loved may perish.  Of course they didnt seem like themselves! they had more important things to concern themselves with than to act \\"normal.\\"  This \\"wild ride\\" had to have been expected considering we are dealing with vampires and werewolves.  One musnt expect things to remain normal in such an aberrant story.  Like I said, I personally LOVED the book and laid my book down with a complacent smirk upon my face at its conclusion.  I thought I would be left disappointed at its end and hungry for more, but I was only left with the thirst to relive the saga again and again.  It felt complete!  I was satisfied with how stephenie maintained \\"edge of the seat\\" content, and even with Jacobs imprinting (although many thought it was disturbing even though he did not have sexual feelings for her...yet, he just wanted to make her happy--> its not like it hasnt happened before with a member of his own pack).  I also enjoyed the fact that Bella had the chance to experience the ultimate human experience of having a child created from love that was his and her flesh and blood! I wont say any more so I that I dont spoil it any more than I have already for readers but I applaud stephenie for satisfying me in every way with the events that transpired even though I know we all have our own \\"taste\\" preferences. Ultimately, the story still held a strong message inherent in Bella's self growth and maturity as we watched it progress through the books, in her responsibilities as a wife, mother, sister, and daughter and in her strength and courage in the face of danger.  P.S. I guess the only thing I hated was the NAME! I wish Nessies name wasnt so damn complicated and long.
B0007Y08PQ|4.0|The Good Things<br />*Good action and special effects.  Love the nebula battle scene.<br />*Good filming style.  Generally more colorful and upbeat.<br />*Pretty good storyline.<br />*Good characters.<br />*Good writing.  Contains some comedy and a nice love story.  Also some interesting content concerning immortality and having two species of the same genetic root fighting each other.<br />*One or two interesting themes about youth.<br />*Pretty good music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Nothing particuarly special; the movie feels more like a two-hour long episode.<br /><br />The Questionable Things<br />*This film is called \\"Insurrection,\\" but it's not that big of an insurrection.  I expected the Enterprise to oppose the entire Federation or something, but it's more like a small isolated incident.<br />The Questionable Things<br /><br />This film is nothing too big, dramatic, or exceptional, and plays out more like another typical episode.  Still, it is pretty fun, as it contains some good action, special effects, and comedy.  It is also stylistically interesting, with some very slick ship designs and colorful settings.  It's good fun for Star Trek fans, but most other people may be dissapointed.<br /><br />The one-disc version has good video and sound quality.  The two-disc version also has good quality, and includes a number of featurettes and trailers.
0061537934|5.0|I loved this novel which was narrated by the dog Enzo, a canine philosopher and race car fan.  The story of Enzo and his owner Denny will make you think, laugh out loud and cry, all in one read.  I loved Enzo's \\"Enzo-sights,\\" insights about life that are so true.  I laughed and I cried, and I hugged my dog.  This is a book that you will want to read again.
B00006G8HX|4.0|The Good Things<br />*Lots of good special effects and action .  Includes some really big epic scenes, such as the Enterprise self-destructing, and planet Genesis exploding.<br />*Filming style is good.<br />*Storyline is not bad.  Includes lots of dramatic scenes and some good funny comedy.<br />*Characters are not bad.  They aren't as great as the last film, but they have their moments.<br />*Writing is not bad; lots of good lines.<br />*Music is good (practically the same themes as in the last film).<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Seems short, sweet, and simple.<br />*Oh, did Kirk's son really have to die?<br /><br />Although this film seems shorter and weaker, it is essential viewing for the series.  It boasts some of the biggest action scenes, and has some very dramatic parts.  Not to mention, a lot of funny parts too.  It's definately a lot of fun.<br /><br />The one-disc version had okay video and sound quality.  The two-disc version has good quality, and contains a number of featurettes and trailers.
B000UJ48VI|3.0|It goes without saying that the book is better than the movie, but I just had to say it anyway because it's so true. There are a ton of great reviews of the movie here on Amazon so I'll be brief.     3 Stars were given becuase of the very fine acting, especially Shelly Winters. Winters portrays almost exactly the Charlotte Haze that I had envisioned in my mind when reading the book. Sue Lyon does a fine job as Dolores even though she looks nothing at all like how I pictured Lolita in my mind, she's too pretty.     My main gripe about the movie is the incessant fading to black after every scene and the constant appearances of Quilty!  The most annoying scene in the entire movie is when Quilty comes out to talk to Humbert at the hotel.   In the movie Peter Sellers goes on a long strange ramble that makes very little sense and was a little annoying to me.   However, this scene in the book, when the understandably paranoid Humbert is biding his time waiting for his drugged nymphet to finally go unconscious is surprised to find another guest on the patio with him, is one of my very favorite scenes in the book. The artful way that Nabokov has our \\"poor Humbert\\" mis-hear the casual conversation of his fellow guest was truly a master work of literature, the movie totally botched this scene!  OK movie of a great book...
B0000UJL96|5.0|The Good Things<br />*Excellent action and special effects (especially the opening, which was probably the first really cool use of the shockwave effect that we now see everywhere else).<br />*Filming style is good.<br />*Storyline is smashing.  Much darker, more dramatic than before.  Lots of interesting political intruigue and mystery.<br />*Reveals a lot in the \\"Star Trek\\" universe.  You finally get to see more of Klingon culture, and you get to see that they have pink blood, and so on.<br />*Characters are great; acting is good.<br />*Writing is good.  A few memorable lines, and a few bits of dry humor that doesn't take away too much from the serious storyline.<br />*Strong themes about the uncertainty of the future (hence the Shakespearean motif).<br />*Excellent music; a different theme, but very dramatic.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Bloody  violence and the dark atmosphere may be too inappropriate for young kids.<br /><br />For the longest time, this was my favorite \\"Star Trek\\" film (until I decided that the \\"Wrath of Kahn\\" was better).  This still ranks highly with me, for it is very dark, dramatic, mysterious, and intense.  At the same time, it does have a happy ending, and the film overall serves as a great final homage to the original \\"Star Trek\\" cast.<br /><br />The one-disc version had okay video and sound quality.  The two-disc version has good quality and a number of featurettes and trailers.
B0000024YL|3.0|There are three reasons why you may want to buy this album and one why you may not:<br /><br />1.) If you're a first generation S&G fans who copped the vinyl when it first came out and is feeling a touch nostalgic, this is definitely the disc for you.<br /><br />2.) If you're not a Boomer, but a Gen X or Y-er who is doing their best to recreate Mom & Pop's listening experience for yourself, and you are big on hearing what previous generations actually heard when they rushed home from the record store with this disc in hand back in the summer of '72, then this is also the disc for you.<br /><br />3.) Finally, if you're an S&G completist who just has to have everything they've ever released, then once again, you're looking at your disc.<br /><br />However, if you're simply searching for a comprehensive S&G collection, then buyer beware.  There are several reasons why this disc doesn't fit the bill in that regard.  First of all, the obvious: it was released in 1972, and although all of their studio releases had wrapped up two years earlier, any post-72 work you may be looking for does not appear here (think Concert in Central Park, etc.).<br /><br />Secondly, much of their pre-1972 work is also ignored.  At 14 tracks and just over 44 minutes, this CD simply comes up a little short. Perhaps most importantly, if you're unfamiliar with this album then you need to know that the familiar studio versions of several songs (including 'For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her,' 'The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy)' and 'Homeward Bound') are eschewed in favor of live versions. If any of this is of any importance to you, then be aware that there are more comprehensive S&G collections out there at reasonable prices, including 'The Best of Simon & Garfunkel' and the 2 disc 'The Essential Simon & Garfunkel'.<br /><br />Peace and Happy Listening!
B000083C49|4.0|The Good Things<br />*Some good special effects.  Some of it is quite memorable.<br />*Filming style is good.<br />*Storyline is great; an interesting departure from the story-arc of the last two films that ties everything together nicely.<br />*Characters are still good.  You get to learn one or two more things about them all.  Good acting.<br />*This is mostly a comedy, so there are loads of funny scenes.  Lots of memorable dialogue.  Good writing.<br />*Strong themes about the environment and saving the whales from extinction.<br />*Music is good (uses a different, more upbeat theme).<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Ummm...<br /><br />The Questionable Things<br />*It almost seems too different in a way; can be good or bad.<br /><br />This is definately the funniest and most light-hearted of the bunch.  Aside from the continuing \\"Star Trek\\" storyline and a number of great special effects, the story is dominated largely by hilarious dialogue and scenes as the crew travels back in time and tries to fit into an urban environment.  On top of it all, it has some  very strong messages about preserving our environment.  Altogether, it'll leave you smiling.<br /><br />The one-disc version had okay video and sound quality.  The two-disc version has good quality and a number of featurettes and trailers.
031606792X|1.0|This novel disappoints on several levels. I found the plot to be tedious and forced, the characters to have changed radically from the previous three books in the series, a heavy dose of misogyny in the text, and ultimately, major reversals from the previous trajectory of the series.    (Spoilers below)    First, the story's plot failed to satisfy me. The most interesting element of the plot to me was the impending appearance of the Volturi and the question about their motivations as the guardians/royalty of the vampire world. This question fizzled out both because Meyer introduced at least twenty new vampires too late in the novel and because once the Volturi appeared, she missed the chance to give the Cullens and their allies the chance to fight for their beliefs (thereby showing their commitment to these beliefs).    I also found the characters massively disappointing. Although Bella spends much of the third part thinking about how her personality has remained the same since her change into a vampire, she has lost her two primary characteristics (her clumsiness and cooking for Charlie). I found the scenes between her and her daughter awkward and unconvincing. Edward became very wooden and flat, as did Alice, and Bella's human friends, her parents, and a lot of the Quileute pack disappeared almost entirely.     Bella's changes also reinforce the books' inherent misogyny. From the very first book, Bella's only interest is Edward. Even putting aside his paternalistic attitude of \\"I know what you need and what is best for you better than you do,\\" reflected in both his dialog and his actions (like buying her the armored car), I find it disturbing that she is so centered on him. In the fourth book, as Bella accepts his many gifts (the car, the house, the jewelry) she becomes less interesting as a character. Other disturbing elements of the plot include Rosalie's and Leah's depression about being infertile and Renee's willingness to ignore her own life experiences to encourage her daughter to take the same actions that she later found to be irresponsible and mistakes. While neither choosing to raise a family instead of going to college or having a career nor wanting children are inherently anti-feminist, I thought that the way all these elements worked together in this book created the expectation for the female characters that they only need succeed in the home, rather than fully explore all the options available to them.     Finally, this book reverses the messages of the first three books. In Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse, it becomes very clear that Bella cannot have it all--she must choose between two types of lives, which comes down to a decision between happiness and security (Jacob) and all-consuming love (Edward). In a series of barely-believable plot twists (which incidentally violate the internal consistency of the world Ms. Meyer has created) Ms. Meyer not only gives Bella everything she wanted (contact with her family, Edward, and Jacob as a platonic best friend) but the thing she didn't even know to request (a daughter). In this sense, Breaking Dawn betrays the story of Eclipse and makes Bella's struggles and difficult choice almost meaningless--she doesn't have to sacrifice anything after all.    I would not recommend this book to anyone; it failed to develop the potentially interesting points of conflict and refused to allow any of its characters to face the consequences of their actions (and thus to grow).
B0000683DH|5.0|The Good Things<br />*Excellent action and some gorgeous special effects (including a very early example of CGI effects).<br />*Filming style is great and very original.<br />*Production design is a vast improvement over the first \\"Star Trek\\" film.<br />*Sound design is splendid too.<br />*The storyline is great.  It takes after the episode \\"Space Seed\\" in the original series, but it's not entirely necessary to watch it in order to understand the movie.<br />*The characters are awesome.  Kahn (Ricardo Montalban) is one of the best bad guys ever, and his performance is so dramatic.  Kirk is very compassionate.  Everybody else is good; great acting.<br />*Good writing.  Lots of memorable lines.<br />*Strong themes about life and death, birth and rebirth, and growing old.<br />*Good music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*A few bloody bits (mostly involving alien bugs that burrow into people's ears); probably not for young kids or the extremely squeamish.<br /><br />Definately the best of the \\"Star Trek\\" film saga.  It does away with the dull space-opera elements of the first film and provides a smashing extravaganza of space battles, epic story-telling, and intense character conflicts.  The writing is totally awesome, and presents loads of great lines and dramatic acting.  It's a classic in every sense.<br /><br />The original one-disc release has okay video and sound quality, and includes a trailer.  The newer two-disc set has good quality and sound, and a bunch of fascinating featurettes and trailers.
031606792X|2.0|I am so dissappointed with this book.  I absolutely devoured the other 3 and was one of the 40 year old midnight book purchasers.  I kept reading this thinking that A. She didn't even write it. or B.  She certainly didn'  t run this by anyone.  It was such a let down.  My love affair with this series was was stolen from me.  It feels like a 750 page bird crap landed on my head.  Like many fans have already said, Jacob imprinting on their child, get an abortion and you can have sex with my wife, the creepy way the baby was talking to them so early, the name Nessie. I could go on and on.  Man this book could have been so much better. Absolutlely no magic.  I think I will toss it in the fire and keep re-reading the other 3.
B00078XGRO|5.0|The Good Things<br />*Excellent action and special effects.  The opening battle scene is probably the best of the series.<br />*Filming style is good.<br />*The storyline is good.  Includes a great deal of excitement, comedy, and drama.<br />*Incorporates a good deal of stuff from the Star Trek universe.  The Borg make for the best bad guys of the series.  They are quite menacing (and it's about time they stopped bringing up the Klingons!).  Also an original and refreshing look at the history of the saga, involving the guy who invented Warp Drive.<br />*Characters are good.  Picard shows a great deal of pain and compassion.<br />*Writing is good.<br />*Music is good.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Ummm...<br /><br />To start with, this film has some of the best action and battle scenes in the series.  It also boasts some immersive drama, comedy, and suspense.  And it ties in a lot of aspects from the TV shows to create a coherent plot.  It's probably the best film done by the Next Generation crew, and is certainly worthwhile watching.<br /><br />The one-disc version had good video and sound quality.  The two-disc version still has good quality, and has a number of featurettes and trailers.
031606792X|5.0|I will admit that when I first realized that Bella was pregnant, I was shocked.  I honestly never saw that coming.  BUT...to be completely fair, I didn't know what to expect from BD at all.  I knew I wanted three things to happen...  1) Edward and Bella get married  2) Bella become a vampire  3) Find a way for Jake to be okay with Bella's choice and change.  And, they all happened.  Given, not in ways that I expected, but in ways that I was okay with...after some thought...lol.  I'm probably the biggest vampire nerd ever and I've never understood why.  But, from the age of 11 I've devoured any and all vampire books.  (Most that an eleven year old probably shouldn't have read.)  And believe me when I say that I've come across way more disturbing situations than what most of you are complaining about.    So...Bella got married at 18. All of you are freaking out over this instead of her choosing to become immortal at 18?  Hmmm...priorities...  And yes, its way off the wall that she became pregnant, but I've read many other vampire novels that have dealt with that.  IT'S SUPERNATURAL!!!  Therefore, vampires, werewolves, etc...they don't have to conform to our biological rules.  Just because YOU don't understand it, doesn't mean that its not possible.  The mere fact that they ARE vampires should attest to that.  It's biologically impossible...yet you're reading a vampire novel and griping about biology?  You're reading about a fictional/fantastical world and wanting to add our human limitations to it?  How is that any fun at all?  Of course you didn't enjoy the book!!!  Use your imaginataion.  All in all, after I got over the shock of the pregnancy, I enjoyed the book immensely!  I laughed histarically when I realized that Jacob was going to imprint on Renesmee.  Oh come on...it's funny!!  It did bother me at first, sure...but again...it's FICTION!  And, yes, it was an easy fix for the Bella/Jacob thing, but why couldn't it be?  Why does everything have to be so hard.  And so what if everything was \\"wrapped up in a nice bow\\" at the end.  Why for the love of God would anyone want to read something that ends realistically?  Don't you get enough of that out of your life?  Personally, I read books to escape reality...maybe that's why I'm drawn to vampires (who knows?).  If I wanted reality, I wouldn't read fantasy/fiction...and ESPECIALLY not vampire fantasy/fiction.  Good grief!  And on my last note...how dare any of you attack Stephenie's parenting?  Do you honestly think that she would persuade her children to take her books literally?  If you want to attack a writer over her book, that's fine.  It's your opinion...but you should never call into question a writer's parenting abilities because you don't agree with her book.  It's low and childish.
B000A6T1KE|4.0|The Good Things<br />*Lots of cool action and special effects.<br />*Very different filming style.  Much more vivid and interesting use of colors and camera angles.  Also a bit darker and more dramatic.<br />*Storyline is interesting.  It's cool to finally see the Romulans in a film.<br />*Characters are smashing.  There are lots of paralells involved; Picard vs his clone, Data vs B-4 (his clone), Troi vs that ugly alien, Riker vs the same ugly alien, and so on.  Duality is the key point, and it makes for some very interesting interactions and dialogue.<br />*Writing is good.  Not so much comedy, but definately lots of drama.<br />*As mentioned above, strong themes of duality.<br />*Okay music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*The ending is a little dissapointing.  Data is dead, the Enterprise is destroyed again, and everybody moves onto different paths.  It almost warrents a whole new Star Trek TV series.<br /><br />The Questionable Things<br />*It's almost too different.  Definately a strange departure from previous films.<br /><br />I didn't really like this one at first, but I'll be darned if it didn't grow on me.  The action and special effects are very slick and cool.  Above all, there are a lot of interesting issues involving duality between the characters, with the Romulans, and overall light and dark.  It's dark and deep, but also a little too dreary and different.  Still, it's very interesting and entertaining.<br /><br />The one-disc version had good video and sound quality, and had some deleted scenes and featurettes.  The two-disc version has good quality still, some of the same extras, plus additional featurettes.
031606792X|5.0|I enjoyed the first 3 books and thought this was a fun and terrific ending to Edward and Bella's story.  I think some people are trying to read too much into what is simply meant to be a fun, entertaining read.  I enjoyed the characters, loved the development of the love story over the course of the 4 books and had a great time reading it.  I had a high school English teacher who once said, \\"Sometimes in a book a tree is just a tree and reading more into it ruins the experience.\\"  That, to me, is true of Meyer's book.  Breaking Dawn brings this epic romance to a satisfying conclusion and trying to read more into ruins that.  I say, sit down in a comfy chair with a Diet Coke and some good snacks and have fun!
B0000AUHOH|4.0|The Good Things<br />*A lot of good special effects and action scenes (albiet the quality is noticably different).<br />*Filming style is good.<br />*Characters are good and deep.  Good acting, once agian.<br />*Writing is not bad.  Some good comedy, some good drama.<br />*Good music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Pretty iffy storyline.  I liked the idea and the fact that it is so grand.  But most people seem to have a problem with it and other aspects (such as Spock having a half-brother who is so compassionate).<br /><br />The Questionable Things<br />*It looks as though they tried to make it grittier, edgier, and more sleazy.  It kind of works, but in a way, it may be too different.<br />*Despite the quality of the effects, some of them are totally weird at the end.<br /><br />Bigger is not always better.  This film is a great departure from the previous ones, bumping up the scale of the story, adding even more to the characters, and making everything a little scummier.  I think it's pretty fun, but it really is the weakest of the \\"Star Trek\\" films.<br /><br />The one-disc version had okay video and sound quality.  The two-disc version has similarly okay quality and a number of featurettes and trailers.
031606792X|1.0|I've enjoyed each installment of the \\"Twilight\\" saga more than its predecessor so, I was all set to love \\"Breaking Dawn\\". Unfortunately, like many, I was sorely disappointed by the book.     ***SPOILER ALERT***    Granted, I'm not in the book's target demographic, I'm in my early thirties, maybe if I was sixteen, I wouldn't have been bothered by the way, everything turned out sickeningly, annoyingly, improbably perfect. Beginning with her parents unrealistic acceptance of Bella's marriage at eighteen. I believe her mother, Renee, who we were led to believe would be very much against the idea, said something along the lines of, \\"You love him right? You'll never want anyone else, right? Well okay then!\\" and then continuing with the private island honeymoon, the stellar sex, the far fetched conception and birth of Edward and Bella's absolutely gorgeous, genius, immortal, psychic daughter who just so happens to be Jacob's soulmate... By the time they got to the adorable cottage in the woods I wanted to throw the book across the room.     Why was there no follow up of the storyline with Rosalie and her desperate desire for a child of her own. It just kind of faded away to make room for happier scenarios. Guess what? All Bella's worries about being a newborn vampire with a ravenous thirst for blood? Didn't happen. Why? Who knows, who cares because she looks like a supermodel now. It just goes on and on and the whole confrontation with the tired, old Volturi at the end was so boring. Ugh!    \\"Breaking Dawn\\" reminded me of that old episode of the \\"Twilight Zone\\" where the bad guy thinks he's in heaven because he's getting everything he wants but later on, bored out of his mind by the tedium of everything being perfect, comes to realize he's in hell. It's like Ms.Meyer wanted so badly to give Bella and by extension her fans, everything we could possibly want, a perfect husband, a perfect child, a perfect face, a designer wardrobe.. She forgot to tell us a good story.     I'mso sad to series end this way.
031606792X|5.0|I will simply say that as a young mom to 3 little boys, and where my time is very precious to me, I could not have spent it any better on something purely for my pleasure.  I absolutely loved this book, as did all of my friends that have finished it.  Without going in to every detail of the book, I loved every part of the book from beginning to end.  It made me happy, sad, mad, my stomach in knots, and laughing out loud.  The characters I have grown to love, only grew and made me love them more.   It was creative and never boring.  I have never enjoyed a book (especially a series) so much.  Thank you, Stephenie for creating this series and sharing this amazing story with all of us.  I will forever be a fan!
0920668372|1.0|What is the point of driving home mortality to a kid.  \\"Look, Kid, your parents are going to get old and die and leave you alone some day ... mwoo ha ha ha ha.\\"  this is a stupid book with no point.  it tries to be emotive for emotive sake, but the end result is a morbid heap of trash.  skip it!

031606792X|1.0|Breaking Dawn exemplified for me exactly why Stephenie is a novice writer.      In her previous books she set us up to expect two major conflicts: Bella/Edward/Jacob, and the Venturi.  In Breaking Dawn Stephenie completely wimps out, give us predictable and just downright awful solutions.  The entire time I was reading I kept saying, \\"This is ridiculous.  She's cheating us!\\"      In Eclipse, she has made it clear that Bella is IN LOVE with both Jacob and Edward.  Yet in Breaking Dawn she clears that up.. poof!.. by having Jacob impress on Bella's daughter.  I'm sorry, but what happened to Bella being in love with him?  It's not enough to add a few lines about Bella beaming when Jacob walks in the room, then after baby is born attribute it to the baby knowing Jacob from the womb.  What a cheat! Stephenie.. this is cheating!    In New Moon, she sets up the Venturi as powerful, scary and awe-inspiring. Their leaders are fascinated by Alice and Edward, and covet them. Then she gives us Breaking Dawn, with a drawn out rambling discussion at the end between the Venturi and the Cullens.  Where the Venturi are stoppped because of a bunch of witnesses?  Oh, and a whole bunch of powerful vampires most of whom we've never heard of before.  Oh, and the sudden appearance of a new race.  How convenient!  And the sad thing is.. that by taking this tact Stephenie makes all her main characters (the ones we know and love) take a back seat to the story.  We get very little dialogue, and very very few scenes between characters that we know.      Which brings me to my biggest issue here.  From the beginning of the series, this has been BELLA's story.  Bella is the voice of the series.  It's Bella and Edward that made us love the story.  And ultimately it's Bella and Edward's story that we want to hear.  In Breaking Dawn, we get a few chapters of the old Bella we know and love... then poof! we get a third of the book told from Jacob's perspective.  Jacob is telling us what is happening to Bella... while she is dying!  Stephenie literally makes Bella a secondary character.  Then once Bella has her baby and becomes a vampire, well, you don't get any time to get to know her with her new life.  It's rush rush rush, and baby, baby, baby until the end.  Move over Bella, this is Nessie's story now (setting us up for a sequel?), and forget Edward.. he gets a scene or two, but really becomes a tertiary character.    I was looking forward to Breaking Dawn because I wanted to hear Bella's story. I wanted to really get to know her as a vampire.  And I wanted Bella and Edward's story.  Instead I got a baby story, and my final image of Bella is of baby on her hip, in some sleek new outfit, and with a new defensive (passive) power that protects her family.  I didn't know her anymore, and Stephenie illustrated to me that she completely lacks the skills a writer needs to transform a character through a life change.    Never mind the whole implication of teenage love to marriage to instant baby.  With today's news about teenage pregancy pacts you'd think Meyer would have a bit more of a clue... but that's a whole other review I could write!      This author tried her best, but at this time in her life just lacks the skills to deliver.  Needs more practice, and a editor and publishing house that's a bit more honest with her.
031606792X|5.0|As I read the reviews of people writing of this novel as \\"unbelievable....impossible...) I am reminded that, well...Vampires and werewolves fall into that category. And although Bella  became pregnant with Edward's child may seem an \\"impossibility\\" to those readers who are envisioning their own preconceived happy ending, this is not out of the grasp of the concept of what we are reading, people!     Bella's character.  Stays true. Stays self sacrificing and bold to a point. Stays STRONG as she always was.  Edward. Pretty much remans the same.  Even as Bella as a vampire, the love is still just as strong and meaningful as ever. Still everything.  Nessie. What else could you ask for?  Jacob.  Saw that one coming a mile away.  Saw that one coming with the first kind word between vampire and werewolf in the other books.    This is an epic novel. It is not (in my view) intended for the younger reader due to such graphic description Meyer so dramatically hands over. It is an amazing roller-coaster ride of twists and turns that none of us expects, yet in some parts we are so thankful for it.    This IS the ultimate happy ending. This is what EVERYONE wants. Kudos to Meyer for giving that to her readers as well as herself. It is so apparant that she loves these characters. She can't part with them and feels an urgent sense of self preservation. It is her own. This is her story. It is so evident that she wrote it for herself. But in that regard, she was mindful of her reader and their expectations.    This is the end. The most satisfying end I could have imagined and more.    Although I do hope there is more...Maybe Nessies more...  I am so greedy!  Thanks Stephenie for an overwhelmingly emotional piece of literature. Just look at the way you are affecting people! Good or bad...a truly great writer affects people...and you have...(for the 4th time in this series...)  :-)
032147404X|3.0|I wish I could understand the more technical aspects of a camera and photography.  I found this book easy enough to understand as I went through and tried to duplicate the work this author had done.  It takes time regardless of what we know what we want to know.  I am glad to have this book in my collection to go over points I am forgetting when I don't take photos daily.
B00008QSAA|5.0|This great reissue of Mountain's \\"Climbing!\\" is awesome!!! Great sound and even a bonus track to boot!!! Recommended for fans of this classic album,and the price tag is great too!!! Two thumbs up! A+
031606792X|1.0|Sorry but this book WAS glorified fan fiction. However I did enjoy Jacobs book. I thought it was very entertaining and funny. The rest of the book was a little too cheesey for me and I have to agree with others when they say that Meyer took the easy way out. Plus it was incredibly confusing how Bella got pregnant when she didnt even go into ANY details. I understand that it is a young crowd but I really dont get why she wouldnt explain it a little bit more. Especially after saying that all vampire fluids are VENOM. So overall this book was a huge let down for me.
B000Q6ZG5C|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet,it's HP and it's on Blu Ray,what else can I say other than this disc rocks!!! Great visuals,sound,and extras!!! I cant believe i got this on sale for only 10 bones brand new!!! A must for the HP and Blu Ray fan!!! Recommended!!! Much better than the standard DVD release!!! A+
031606792X|4.0|I read some of the other reviews below and thought they couldn't be more off. I'm also a huge fan and just loved the twists and turns of the story. I could have never predicted she was going to take the story in this direction. And to be honest, it was nice to be surprised. So what if Bella gets everything...it's a story! The story was well written, great laughs and suspense at the right times. During the third section, some of the out-of-towners really cracked me up! I say, give it a try...it's another great book from Stephine Meyer.
031606792X|2.0|Let me preface this by saying I think Meyers had an EXTREMELY difficult task of wrapping up this series and making everyone happy at the same time.  I also still think she is a great writer!    (Spoilers below...read with caution)    The romance between Edward and Bella was lacking.. A LOT!  The connection Bella and Edward have, which is why I fell in love with the series at first, was missing.  The honeymoon was sad.  No romance...just harsh and cold.    Secondly, I understand Meyer's reason for making the intimate parts of the book more PG...but after the gruesome description of Renesmee's birth...I got to thinking, why is violence and gore so much more acceptable than sex?    Speaking of Renesmee and this is probably trivial...can't stand the name.  And why are we calling Jasper, Jazz??    The standoff with the Volturi in the end was long and dragged out and frankly boring.  Yes my darlings...hopefully this will come to an end, soon!  :)    To leave this on a good note...  The wedding was great.  I didn't mind that Jacob imprinted on Renesmee - this would make a great spin off for the series. Finally we got to see some romance between Bella and Edward at the end of the story...to little, too late.  I like the confidence Bella begins to gain after she becomes a vampire.
B0018QCXGY|5.0|An excellent monster movie presented from a 'home video cam' perspective. I think reports of this being nauseating are exaggerated at least no one (watched at home with 10 other people) all loved it. Exciting, well paced, and some pretty clever special effects going on (according to the special features, nearly everything is blue screened although you have a really hard time noticing the difference).
031606792X|5.0|I am shocked by some of the reviews I have read here.  Breaking Dawn was Stephenie Meyers best book yet and definitely the best of the series.  I could not set it down and now that I am finished, I cant stop thinking about it.  This book took a turn I was not expecting and the storyline was better than I imagined it would be.  I hope she will begin a new series about Renesmee's life, because I want more.  Stephenie Meyer is so talented in her writing and makes you feel like you are a part of the story and the characters are real.  Awesome book- best yet!  Do not let some of these readers comments fool you.
031606792X|4.0|I am surprised that so many people didn't like this book. I thought it was a wonderful end to an amazing series. I am an avid fantasy/ Sci fiction reader and many parts of the story that people disliked so much have similarties in the supernatural worlds that fantasy writers create. It's a supernatural world, one that doesn't function the same way our world does, and many people in their obsession with the series forgot that. What some of the readers are so disgusted with, would be horrible in our world without a doubt, but when your writing about a world with vampires, magic, shapeshifters and other magical people anything can happen and people have to realize that.<br /><br />As mentioned by quite a few other reviews many of the spoilers that reviewers wrote were taken completely out of context...avoiding the explanations and story that Meyer included in the book that make everything ok.<br /><br />So story was a little too \\"everyone with a happy ending\\" but at the same time other than one or two minor charactors happy endings that i thought was pushing it, i thought the story was very well thought out! As for people's complaints that these happy endings never happen in the real world... hello this isn't the real world this is a fantasy novel, life ending as a misery is not neccesary and makes for depressing reading.<br /><br />I loved the story and i thought it was a great ending to a relaly good series. My recommendation is to read it without the prejudices of all reviewers (mine included) and form your own opinion!<br /><br />I hope you enjoy!
031606792X|5.0|Once again Stephenie Meyer has written a fantastic installment (and finale) to the Twilight series. I'll admit it had a lot of science fiction thrown into it and it was on a different level than the previous twilight books but it truly was a happy ending for all. Which leads me to comment on all the negative feedback Breaking Dawn has received. First of all these books are FICTION and she has never claimed to write them to send a positive message to young people. This book is filled with positives and isn't that why we read fiction? To escape all the negatives in our reality? There's nothing wrong with this book and if you truly are a Twilight fan you will find this to be a perfect ending...happily ever after and all.
031606792X|5.0|I enjoyed this book and thought that it was the best of the four in the series.  I look forward to reading Midnight Sun and any other books that the author writes about pertaining to this series.
031606792X|5.0|I loved this book. It was written beautifully. I was happily surprised by everything that happened. Wow! I laughed, I cried, and yelled out loud several times. I HIGHLY recommend this book. Don't listen to all of the negativity. I couldn't put it down. Eating, sleeping, and everything else was put on hold until I finished. I have to read it again. Can't wait till Thursday for the Breaking Dawn Concert!
031606792X|4.0|Pros:  Bella is a more likeable character and her romance with Edward is less cloying, more action and unexpected twists, less angst time.    Cons:  As with the other books, I don't think that Meyer thinks enough about message and theme.    This review contains spoilers!      I don't care what anyone says, this is the best book in the Twilight series.  To begin with, there is so much more going on.  With the other books, I always felt that too much space was wasted with Bella angsting because Edward didn't love her or Jacob DID love her or she wasn't good enough for Edward and the actual plot was just tacked on.  In Breaking Dawn, these internal conflicts and internal commentary on how awesome Edward is fade to the background a bit, though they are certainly still there.  This book has a wedding, a honeymoon, a difficult pregnancy and birth, Bella becoming a vampire and dealing with her powers, Jacob's conflict with splitting from his pack and then imprinting on Nessie, a half-vampire toddler who grows at an amazing rate, and a very significant conflict with the Volturi.  The only part where I felt that there wasn't enough action was during the honeymoon when it went on about Edward and Bella's sex life.      I also think that Bella comes off as a much more likeable character in this book.  She is less whiny throughout and it is nice to see her focused on something other than Edward.  Even if it is just shifting some of her focus to Nessie, it seems much more mature and healthy that she isn't so wrapped up in ONE person.  The dynamics of Edward and Bella's relationship as vampires make me wish that he had bitten her books ago.  It is nice to see them interact as equals.  Before Bella was a vampire, Edward always seemed kind of controlling and semi-abusive and Bella seemed needy and clingy.      At first I was disappointed to have to read so many chapters from Jacob's point of view.  Even though I like him, the book was just getting good at the point that the switchoccurred.  I believe that I may have liked Jacob's point of view even better than the rest of the book, though.  The imprinting with Nessie was also less creepy than I would have expected.    I did not mind the happy ending in general, but I do think that it may have been stronger and more realistic if some of the \\"good\\" characters died.  It wouldn't have to be the main ones -- just someone to add some pain and reflection to Bella's perfect fairytale ending.      I was not completely satisfied with the underlying messages in this book.  The honeymoon scenes, in particular, made me cringe.  \\"Hey girls, he doesn't really MEAN to hurt you even if you wake up with bruises and there is talk of forced abortions.  He just can't control himself.\\"  I was expecting that I would have to cringe at some point, though.  I found these types of disturbing messages in all the books and at least they seem to be mostly gone by the end of Breaking Dawn.      I do wonder if we would be so worried about what type of message the book sends if it wasn't Young Adult.  It is possible to enjoy a good story even if you don't feel comfortable with all the themes, and that is exactly what I did with Breaking Dawn.  I enjoyed it very, very much as a great story with engaging characters.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When I heard about this show, I was totally not interested. But then I was forced to watch it. I love it! I wish it were still on the air. This show was amazingly well written and the follow up movie was awesome! Love this show!
031606792X|1.0|Just an all around poorly written, badly developed, inconsistent, lame book. I read it while recuperating from a high fever, and as the booked progressed from milding entertaining to retarded, taking pit stops at \\"oh no she didn't\\" land and \\"I can't believe this is a published story\\" island, I half wondered if I was hallucinating how wrong this book was by itself and as a series killer.  Then when I finished, I fell into a deep sleep and wished that when I woke up it was all just a bad nightmare.    No such luck, guys.  When I woke up and re-read the entire piece of rubbish again, wide awake and healthy, I realized that no amount of hallucinating, on my part or on SM's part (shame on her for pandering to the easiest resolution for every conceivable conflict) could wipe away the sour taste in my mouth for having consumed, happy under the wrong assumptions, a piece of moldy literature which has destroyed my interest in the Twilight series.    Won't see the movie now.  Why bother, when all the issues being discussed in Twilight about vampire lore and Bella's personality will all be contradicted 1000% in Breaking Dawn.  I had to go and run and re-read something exquisitely written for young adults, truly nuanced and filled with the most perfect love between young adults, Philip Pullman's The Amber Spyglass, to wipe the horrible memory of Breaking Dawn from my mind.      I felt tempted to rip this final book to shreds, but will instead donate the entire trilogy (sorry folks, why bother re-reading any of the other three books when the entire universe SM created has been rendered asunder).  This is what happens when a writer gets lazy, runs out of idea, or simply was never that talented to begin with.  Oh well, it was fun when it lasted, but what a truly disappointing and lame way to ruin her books for her readers.    And lastly, Jacob is probably the world's most manipulated, pathetic character.  Even secondary characters deserve some dignity, and I liked the guy, he hasa personality, flaws, a temper, he was interesting.  Bella of course should be with Edward.  But what SM did to Jacob in this book was the straw that broke the camel's back.  Even to a literary character, a writer should love and cherish and stay true to form, but SM made Jacob imprint on a baby to tie up a messy love triangle.  Yup, that's seriously what happened.  And that's why I'm chucking the entire Twilight series out of my house, in case my daughter accidentally grows up and wants to read it.
031606792X|1.0|I found myself skimming and jumping chapters. I've never considered Stephanie Meyer to be a good writer to begin with, but this book really takes the cake. I was only able to stomach Twilight in its entirety, skimmed New Moon, completely bypassed Eclipse, and wow...I don't know how to even describe my experience reading Breaking Dawn. However, I will try to.     It was horrific. I don't know how this was even published. Her editor and the people at Little Brown must be embarrassed.     The plot was weak and virtually non-existent. She created great characters that could have had much more depth considering there's four books, but no. Readers are stuck with boring and whiny Bella.     I don't understand how people can consider this a good book and how people can be so deeply in love with it. Please go read something better.
0307383415|5.0|This is the book that introduced me to Barack Obama and made me a fan. You will understand Obama by reading this book and why his American experience is closer to today's America than other Presidential candidates.
031606792X|1.0|I was an avid fan of the series and I was ecstatic to read the last book.  I encountered some of the spoilers, but read an article by SM telling her audience to not believe anything they read.  I laughed off the spoilers saying no way, not possible.  To my surprise everything was true.  I wanted to stop reading the book as soon as I got to her pregnancy.  Bella's and Edward's whole relationship was a joke, no where near the intensity that drew in millions of readers to love the first three books.  I guess I was let down.  I do hope that she addresses why she choose to end the book this way because I went from being a devoted fan to the books, to wondering why I even bothered with Breaking Dawn.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I was very impressed with this workout, it really made me sweat and huff and puff and I am in fairly good shape. I really like that after about a week I could see more definition in my arms and abs (my problem area)I was sore after the first day but was able to do the workout again. I did level I for about a week and then moved to level II and that was a good change. I am afraid of level III but will probably try to master level II a little better before attempting Level III. My friend borrowered the workout to see if she would like it and went out and bought it, it really is great but I do not see a beginner or someone who is not familiar with weight training and proper form trying this out although after a week or so of level I they may be okay. I weighed myself and measured myself at the beginning 2 weeks ago just to see if what kind of change there is and although I have not measured or weighed myself since I can tell a difference in my clothes. Overall a good kick in the butt workout and I would recommend it for anyone that needs a change in their workout.

B000YABIQ6|5.0|In terms of writing (story, dialogue, character development) acting, direction, and the great, smoothly polished look of every frame, this fine show is as good as TV gets.  And it needs to be said that the best of TV in recent years -- Friday Night Lights, Damages, Battlestar Galactica, The Shield, and going back a few seasons, Everwood, Veronica Mars, Jack & Bobby -- outshines all but the absolute cream of movies.    Alas, the great bulk of television programming is still the \\"wasteland\\" it was long ago dubbed, but back in the 60s, 70s and 80s when there was almost nothing worth watching on the tube, I can recall that it was every TV actor's aspiration to graduate to \\"features\\" where the best work was being done (and where the big salaries were).    Today, however, for those actors fortunate enough to be working on shows like MadMen, or others of that caliber, they are already working at the pinnacle of their craft.  They are collaborating daily with the most talented people in their industry -- writers, directors, producers, set designers and fellow actors -- all of whom share an artistic commitment to do great work.  And it shows . . . in every aspect of every episode.      Viewed from the perspective of that kind of fulfilling work experience, the only remaining lure of most movies roles could only be the money.    MadMen is not just TV at its best, it is dramatic art at its best.  Check it out -- preferably on DVD!
0743290119|3.0|Chasing Harry Winston is the story of three college girlfriends in New York on the eve of a big event: their thirtieth birthdays. Emmy has recently been dumped by her long-time boyfriend and takes her friends up on a dare to be more risqu&eacute;. Leigh works her dream job as a senior book editor and is engaged to the perfect man, yet she is searching for true happiness. Adriana is the spoiled daughter of a famous supermodel whose life appears ideal but who knows that her looks won't win her the world forever and seeks a purpose to her existence. They all decide that within one year, each will drastically change their life. Weisberger intertwines each woman's quest for love, life, and happiness into an emotional novel that speaks to the heart and allows us into the world of young, hip New Yorkers.<br /><br />I had very high expectations when I began this novel because I adored Weisberger's book, The Devil Wears Prada, but I honestly was rather disappointed. While this novel does have all the glitz and glamour, not all the characters are well developed. Emmy and Leigh are very believable women. I could relate to them, enjoy discovering their personalities and joining them on their adventures. Adrianna, on the other hand, seems to be one-dimensional. Her looks are written about in excess. The novel was also a little cruder than I anticipated.<br /><br />Even though it won't be standard reading for a literary class, Chasing Harry Winston makes for a pleasant beach read. The prose is engaging, the characters amusing, and the plot interesting. It allows the reader to become lost for a few blissful hours in a world far different from the one most of us live in.

031606792X|3.0|This review will contain spoilers.    Unlike most people here, I did not hate this book. Of course, I have minor complaints, the perfect Bella as a vampire, the child with the horrible name (and worse nickname), the surprising lack of Edward and Alice. But those are insignificant compared to the gist of the problem, which is simply, the lack of emotional depth.    We had such a huge sense of the emotions running through the first three books in this series, it was easy to get caught up in. The story was addicting. We were drawn to the characters. In Breaking Dawn, there is so much happening and so much information, that the emotions became easily clouded. In my honest opinion, it should have been broken into 2 separate books, sold 6 months apart from one another. The first book ending with less of description of Jacob imprinting so that could have been revealed in the 2nd and ending simply with the reader knowing that Bella did survive. That would've been enough of a pull for the readers to want to buy the fifth book. Vampire!Bella has always been a draw. And, with the book split in two pieces like that, there would've been more room to examine some of the things that the author seemed to skip or skim over this time.    The previous books not only were emotional drawing (and draining), but the author speckled quite a bit of her own wry sense of humor throughout and the finer details that many people enjoyed. Some of that was still present, but we missed some things that we, as an audience, would've liked to have seen. In the essence of time and space, I'm sure, Meyer was forced to 'tell us what happened' in several situations, versus 'showing us'. Showing is far more effective and the story would've benefited from more showing and less telling. Something as minor as us being able to see Bella run into Rosalie's arms at the airport and forcing herself to turn her head so that she couldn't see the look of betrayal on her husband's face... and then the ensuing arguments, of course. Or as insignificant as Bella getting her 'after' car. Of course she's not thrilled with it, but goodness, Meyer never even said what color it was. Not that it's a big deal, but cars are such a big deal in this series... you'd think that there would've been a bit more information there.     It's those things, no matter how small, that add to the dynamics of a story, and those things which were lacking. And, I have to say, that it likely wasn't Stephenie Meyer's fault that these things weren't present... it was probably the editors. It is their job after all. But, they also should've suggested 2 books to allow her to tell her story with as much detail as she wanted to.    For those that are still bashing the books, my advice is to let it sit, try to eliminate the expectations that you'd had for this book from your head, and then pick it up and reread. It is truly a much better book the second time around. It's easier to see the tiny little sentences that have been tossed in there to try to keep the reader on that same emotional level as the author is. The things that she wanted the readers to understand so that the story doesn't completely fail. Her intent is there, even if there were problems with getting her vision into the readers' minds.
031606792X|1.0|I am not a Twilight hater. In contrast, I like the first three books quite a bit: they're fun, light, romantic and fluffy. Stephanie Meyer was never a great YA writing talent like Philip Pullman or Tamora Pierce, but I liked the world and characters she had created. I picked up Breaking Dawn the day after it came out.  2 hours later, I chucked it across the room in a fit of fury, and only the guilt of spending $15 made me finish it.   THIS IS SEXIST TRASH  As a nineteen-year-old girl, I'd say I should be able to relate what goes on in Bella's head. Although multiple reviewers have outlined the problems with Breaking Dawn, I'd like to throw in a few of my own. (spoilers)  -I related with Bella in the first couple books because she was learning how to be independent and fall in love at the same time. And she didn't want children. But SUDDENLY Stephanie Meyer decides to throw in some abortion controversy and have Bella (a seemingly sane eighteen-year-old) throw her life away for a child all the while exclaiming \\"Oh, who needs education? I married my rich boyfriend in a pretty wedding! And I can have a house and a baby! Woopee!\\" Religious conservatism/mormonism abounds, and while I normally wouldn't have an issue, it's the sudden reversal of character in order to preach these values that made me want to throw up. The author has absolutely NO IDEA WHAT TEENAGERS ARE LIKE. None. Bella is like some bizarre creature from a horny thirteen-year-old's fan fiction. Additionally, I found it extremely disturbing that Edward pretty much owns Bella's sexuality. And the sex scenes were just...blah. Boring. Poorly written. Stupid.   -The writing was laughably bad. And there were zillions of characters who lacked any sort of description, making it really confusing. As I am currently running through the agent process myself, I have absolutely no doubt that this would have been laughed out of the publishing house (if Stephanie Meyer hadn't been given free reign to do whatever she wanted).   -Jacob imprinted Bella's child????? Is this a sick joke??? \\"Here Mr. Lover, you can't have me, but I will force my daughter to love you and you can bang her instead. Gross.   -Edward tries to save Bella's life by getting Jacob to impregnate her? Um........... so, Bella can't be happy unless she has a child. Right.   -Graphic scenes of Bella drinking blood through a straw. Enough said.  -Racism!!! Why are all the characters from brazil described as wild and crazy with \\"cappuccino\\" skin? (One YA agent writes on her website that she throws out any manuscript with coffee-descriptions for skin.  -And for the ten bazillionth time, THAT HORRID NAME!!!!!! renesmee???? AHHHHH    In other words, Stephanie Meyer, please don't pollute the beautiful YA fantasy world with any more of your garbage. Seriously.
031606792X|5.0|This book is the perfect ending to the Twilight saga. Finally, after all they've been through, Bella and Edward have time to be a happy family. They are actually HAPPY. Without sneaking around, without pretending, they can finally live their lives the way they want to. People who can't be happy for Bella and Edward and even Jacob (give him a break) don't make any sense to me. Did you want them to suffer MORE? If you love Edward and Bella then you will like this book.
031606792X|5.0|I have to say I'm completely shocked at the poor reviews I've read for Breaking Dawn. It seems you either love it or are utterly disappointed. I was so anxious to finalize this most compelling FICTIONAL tale and was gratified by Meyers happy ending. The book is compelling from the very beginning, twisting and turning leaving a wide span of emotions.     I am actually amused that those who reviewed the book based on its potentional to serve as a poor example to young teenages citing \\"facts\\" from a ficitious vampiric story very ironic. There isn't anything wrong with a message that says if you follow your heart and persevere at being truly a good person, that you can't have eternal happiness and everything you've ever wanted. That's exactly what Breaking Dawn gave us....everything we wanted.
B0002IQMKM|5.0|The Best of Talking Heads is the latest in a (relatively short compared to other artists) line of \\"Greatest Hits\\" for the band.  However, if you are someone who is looking for a single-disc package of the best songs from each of the band's albums, this is the CD for you.  With an average of two songs from each album and a running time of over 75 minutes, it gives a very good overview of the band.  The songs are very well picked given the limitations of the medium, and I don't think you can do much better when trying to turn a casual listener into a full-fledged fan.  Sure, you can argue about the selections: \\"Houses in Motion\\" over \\"Born Under Punches\\"?  No \\"I Zimbra\\"?  But remember, this CD is for \\"new\\" listeners, and throwing songs like \\"Born Under Punches\\" in is like trying to teach calculus to a five-year-old.  As for \\"I Zimbra\\", it pales in comparison to the other three selections from Fear of Music.  Overall, this album is a great conversion tool to pop in while driving with a friend, which is exactly what it is for.
031606792X|5.0|I was really taken back by all the twists. But I loved that. If Bella had just got married, Edward changed her and Jake was mad about it. Boring !! We could all have guessed that. I love that she ends up pregnant!! It was so unexpected !! I think it was explained well why she was able to get prenant and why they thought she shouldn't have been able to. I was shocked but I excepted it. Love it all ! Stephenie Myers rocks !! All those that didn't like it, too bad !! This was SM book, if you think you can write better-- try it !!! I haven't lost faith in SM, she did an amazing job and not everyone will be happy because everyone had their own ideas of what should happen but it didn't ! This is what was meant to be. As far as Jake imprinting on the baby, I thought it was perfect. We all knew he would imprint and I found it to be a perfect explaination of why Bella had such a tie to him and vice versa.  Book was awesome !!!! Would recommend to anyone !!!!
B000WC3A0S|5.0|I purchased this Saga collection for myself b/c I am a BIG Rocky fan.  I have watched the movies over and over again on t.v. and when they were in the theaters way back, and I can watch them over again.  S.S. plays a great Rocky, however, in the last movie, Rocky Balboa, I wasn't happy with it, it appears to have been made hastily and without alot of thought involved.  I do not recommend the last movie only, the other Rocky movies, well, they ROCK !!!!  I love them.  but, judge for yourself, see if you like the last Rocky Balboa movie more than I do, for me, it was a let down compared to the outstanding other Rocky movies.
031606792X|1.0|I had high hopes for the final book from the Twilight saga, and I was sorely disappointed.  The plot was worse than usual, the characters were wildly out of character, and the resolution was unsatisfying.    Not worth buying, and barely worth the time to read it.  Avoid, avoid, avoid.
031606792X|1.0|Seems like she tired too hard to please her fans and failed miserably.  For fans wanting to know how the series ends, just go to the bookstore and read the epilogue. Don't waste your money.  If you already bought it, keep your receipt.
031606792X|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the final installment of the Twilight Series! It was everything I could ask for and more. The book has a wonderful balance of character development and plot and gives a satisfying ending to the story of Bella and Edward. There were a few surprises along the way, which I won't give away-but I truly loved the plot twists! This book is definitely not intended for young readers, as it has sexual scenes and a few \\"gory\\" scenes, but everything is done tastefully and provides parents an opportunity for good discussions with older teens. The story has excitement and romance, suspense and resolution-I finished it feeling so happy and content with the outcome!    In response to the unfortunately poor reviews, I suggest the idea that the best books provide cause for discussion-which this obviously has. I don't feel like Meyer set out to change the world with her story, or convince young people that vampire love exists as the only way to true happiness. Instead, she has provided readers with a chance to enter a world as magical as it is dangerous, and escape reality for a few hours. I enjoyed the growth Bella's character sees after the past years of mistakes and hardship. She does work for her \\"happily ever after\\" and sometimes life does work out-I believe in happy endings, and I am glad Ms. Meyer does, too!    All in all, this is a wonderful final installment that I will read over and over again!
B00005S6K6|5.0|I saw this film many years ago in a local theater here in the Philippines (Greenbelt 1 in Makati City) and I simply loved it! It was so romantic! My grandmother too loved the film when she saw it on video and it has become like a practice for us to see the film every once in a while on DVD especially when it is Christmas time to relive how wonderful and heartwarming this movie is which is timed at Christmas. I became an instant Meryl Streep fan when I first saw this movie. A very underrrated film I must say but one of her best. I simply love how this film shows how two people meet by chance and then later on when they decide to meet by choice and framed within a New York setting during Christmas time when people are going through the holiday rush. The music by Dave Grusin (I loved how he used Mountain Dance throughtout the film) is perfect and the magnificent ending is really one for the books - one of the best endings I have ever seen in the movies. The film also captures Meryl and Robert at their youthful best! Meryl was so beautiful in this film and Robert was really leading man handsome which spelled magic in their wonderful scenes together. This film ranks among my favorite films of all time because of its simplicity and beauty. I commend the director Ulu Grosbard and the writer Michael Cristofer for this gem!
B0013N4AT0|4.0|An epic Black Metal/Death Metal classic album. An excelent musical work, filled with an extraordinary mix of progressive elements. Highly recommended for the progressive fan with ears really open to the new tendencies of the metal and progressive music. An Icon.
031606792X|4.0|Ok first off i don't want to say that i didn't like this book at all and if i did i would be lying but instead of disliking i guess i had a hard time believing it like for instance Bella having a kid that i sorta considered happening but the way it was written about how bella felt towards her kid was somehow....hmmm not explained as i expected it would be as it would if a mother would start talking about her life and joy and also i hate jacob even more for imprinting on the rare, unexpected, almost impossible'ish kid of edward and bella!! but besides all that i'd say a good decent book compared to the others and again not saying it sucks or isn't good just pointing out two things i didn't like that much.
0764137433|2.0|This is a great resource.  It's very helpful and well organized but unfortunately, the binding is poor.  My copy has been used only a couple of months and it's literally falling apart.
0143038419|4.0|Who wouldn't want to take a year off to indulge your deapest passions.  This book was an enjoyable read and a great summer read.  The author shares some deep introspection of a year on the road, writing with humor and eye towards detail.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I love this series and wish there was more. The cancellation of this show proves that TV execs are real idiots. What do we get now? Horrible reality shows! I highly recommend this series and the movie Serenity. I know all the actors have other assignments now, but I wish there was more Firefly episodes. The writers could have taken this story to even greater heights, but apparently weren't given the chance. Too bad.
0061150142|5.0|Picoult does it again!  This story is beautifully written about two young teenagers who are in love.  One dies abruptly and it is a toss-up between if she was suicidal, or if her boyfriend (and long time best friend/ soulmate) murdered her.  This story is very emotional- very forthright and keeps you reading and reading because you simply MUST FIND OUT what happened.<br />Again, as in all of Picoult's novels, it is a very controversial topic, and there is much lawyer/ cop dialogue that may get your mind bungled- however it is such a poetic story that you will not even hesitate to keep going.<br />Personally, I fell in love with the main male character and by the end of the book, I HATED the female lead.  (I cannot disclose any more details for fear of spoiling the story)<br />Keep your mind open and try to remember what it was like to be COMPLETELY in love.  If we were all so lucky, I truly doubt there would be any murder/ hate/ heinous crimes in this world.<br />MUST READ-  MUST MUST MUST READ.
031606792X|5.0|I can only assume that those who gave negative reviews wanted the 'other' team to win.  I loved the story.  I loved all the drama & the exciting end.  The only thing depressing to me is that the series had to end.  I think Stephanie did an excellent job bringing the story to a conclusion and I also thought perhaps she left a tiny door open at the end for another book.  Maybe just wishful thinking on my part.  Again, I loved the book.
0743496736|5.0|Jodi Picoult surpassed all of her other novels in this one!  I have read many many of her books, and never have I felt so torn between liking/ disliking a main character.  Picoult really gets into character and every single one of them are believable and even love-able.  Even the characters who are obviously the \\"bad guys\\" are still able to pull you into their reins and make you want to cheer them on too!<br />As in all of Picoult's novels, there are lawyers who become involved, parents of the disturbed teenagers, and teenage romantic interests.  There are always hard-to-talk-about topics in Picoult's novels, as well, and Nineteen Minutes does not disappoint.<br />Nineteen Minutes is about a high school massacre and Picoult takes the reader into the minds of those who were shot, those who were saved, and those who did the assaults.  There are twists and turns at every angle and it is never what you expect it to be.<br />A very good read, strong deliverance!
1577314808|5.0|Eckhart Tolle's acclaimed book \\"The Power of Now\\" has many powerful lessons for living. It's a transformational tool to help us shift our consciousness and a signpost for awakening.<br />The life lessons that were the most helpful to me included:<br />The answer to the human dilemma cannot be found through the intellect but through consciousness (awareness) and our response to what happens.<br />Consciousness is the only lasting and meaningful aspect of who we are. It transcends our bodies, minds, emotions, possessions and events. Yet most of our energy and attention goes into doing, work, appointments, to-do lists, mind-clutter, possessions and commitments. The opposite of doing is being: stillness, spaciousness, awareness, silence and spontaneity. Doing is never enough if we neglect Being.<br />Recognizing that our ego, the unawakened self, is an imposter pretending to be us.<br />Making ourselves right or wrong is one to the principle mind egoic patterns. Nothing will satisfy us as long as the ego remains in place.<br />The power of allowing lies in noninterference, non-doing, in Presence, in the space between the clutter of thought and emotion. Wisdom, joy, love, creativity and aliveness are in the gap between the perception and the interpretation.<br />Being present is infinitely more powerful than anything we could say or do.<br />Surrender to pain it's not who we are. Pain is a doorway out of our ego prison. It's not the pain but the identification with the pain that forces us to relive the past again and again and keeps us in a state of unconsciousness.<br />To stop our egoistic body identification we should shift our attention from our external thought to the feeling of aliveness inside. The intensely alive energy field is our life energy, the bridge between the form and the formless.<br />What matters in not what we say and believe but how we act and react.<br />Whatever we think the world is withholding from us, we are withholding from the world. Just act as if we had it, and it will come. When we start giving we will receive.<br />The source of abundance is inside us. When we acknowledge the abundance around us it awakens to dormant abundance within.<br />Whatever we perceive, experience, do, think or feel is content. Content is what absorbs most people. Content is not essence. Essence is the formless inner space of consciousness. The universe is an indivisible whole in which all things are interconnected. The atoms that make up your body were once forged inside stars.<br />When we don't mind what happens we are aligned with what is. When we align with the present moment our actions become empowered by the intelligence of Life itself.<br />The ego can never be aligned with the present moment. The ego sees the present as a means to an end, an obstacle or an enemy. We become Present when we see our dysfunction and make friends with the Now. Presence is a state of inner spaciousness.<br />Life is always now. There is only this moment. The elimination of time from our consciousness is the elimination of ego.<br />When we say yes to the Now, the Now becomes a doorway into the formless and the separation between the world and God dissolves.<br />The joy of Being, which is our true happiness, cannot come to us through any form, possession, achievement, person, or event. It emanates from the formless dimension within us, from consciousness itself and thus is one with who we are. If we are content with being nobody in particular we align ourselves with the power of the universe.<br />Through us the universe is becoming aware of itself.<br />We are so consumed by time that we have forgotten eternity, which is our destiny. Eternity is the living reality of who we are.<br />Non-resistance, non-judgment and non-attachment give true freedom. Through acceptance, we become spacious inside.<br />Being aware of breathing for a year is more powerfully transformative than attending any courses. The more we are aware of the breath, themore its natural depth will reestablish itself.  Conscious breathing stops the mind. Three conscious breaths stops compulsions.  Discover inner space by creating gaps in our thinking. Awareness is Presence, consciousness without thought, and connection with universal intelligence. The mind of God is consciousness.<br />A belief in God is a poor substitute for the living reality of God manifesting every moment in our lives.<br />Give others full attention. The space of awareness is more important than what we are talking about.<br />Our entire life journey ultimately consists of the step we are taking at this moment.<br />Live with uncertainty, even enjoy it. There is ultimately no such thing as \\"my\\" life, since \\"my\\" and \\"life\\" are one.<br />All of the ancient religions point to two fundamental truths. The first is that humankind's \\"normal\\" state of mind is dysfunctional. Hinduism calls it maya the veil of delusion, Buddhism refers to it as dukka or suffering, Christianity calls it \\"original sin\\" meaning \\"to miss the point\\" to live unskillfully or blindly.<br />Although humankind is intelligent and our achievements are impressive in science, medicine, technology, architecture and the arts our intelligence is also tainted with insanity.<br />The second truth in all religions is that a radical transformation of human consciousness is possible. The Hindus called the transformation Enlightenment, the Buddhists Liberation, and the Christians Salvation.<br />Humanity's greatest achievement is not science and technology but the recognition of our individual and collective madness. The moment we recognize that \\"normal\\" human existence is a  collective nightmare we begin a process of healing and transcendence.<br />Many religious teachings have become distorted, divisive and part of a collective insanity. Yet in spite of all the insanity in the name of religion, the Truth to which they all point still shines through. There have been individuals throughout history who experienced a shift in consciousness and realized within themselves the Truth to which all religions point.

031606792X|5.0|I simply loved Breaking Dawn.  It pulled all of the previous story points together, and how could we not see what was coming now that we've read it?    I do understand how some might be disappointed with the book, but I simply cannot, I love the writing of Stephenie Meyer and although some of this book was a bit \\"out there\\", I still could not put it down.
031606792X|5.0|I am a new fan to the Twilight Saga, I read the first three books just days before this one was released, and I only read them once so far. This book was not really what I was expecting, but nevertheless, I really enjoyed it. I read it in two days (I have a toddler, so I can't devote the amount of time required to read it in one sitting, or I would have), finished it this morning, and am thinking about re-reading the whole series again.<br /><br />For those who read the books several times and could take the time to digest every little detail, maybe they knew what was coming. Looking back, there were plenty of clues that made me say \\"well, duh!\\" Either I didn't pay close enough attention, or Stephanie Meyer is good enough at writing clues without having them scream \\"this is what is coming!\\"<br /><br />I thought the entire series was very well written, and the writing itself got better with each book. I felt completely immersed in Bella's world. The morals of the story didn't really concern me, as I am not a the parent of a teenage girl, and if I were, I would hope my child understood the difference between fiction and reality. Fiction exists to amuse us, to entertain us, to take us away from reality, not to teach us life lessons or be a fill-in for the deep discussions that we should be having with our children. Sometimes we do take away some deeper meaning, some deeper understanding, and that's great. But most of the time, we are just meant to enjoy a different world, a different reality, and escape the mundane tasks of everyday life. This book did that for me, and that is all I can expect.
031606792X|5.0|While this is certainly not the best book in the series, I certainly don't feel it was as bad as some of the reviews might lead you to believe. I really enjoyed the book. Maybe my expectations were not as high as other reviewers' in the sense that i was not looking for a powerful message, a role-model, or an example to be set. I hate to admit it, but I did just want a happy ending. And I got my wish.
B00125WAWS|4.0|portrayal of how persons can rise above extremely adverse situations. Things may get difficult but not impossible especialy if there is team effort seems to be the message here. Superb performance from Washington, Whitaker and Jurnee Smollett.
B00003CXV4|5.0|I loved this movie! Charlize Theron and Keanu Reeves were wonderful together. It was actually beautiful yet sad at the same time.Sara Deever ( Charlize) takes a different man into her home every month. Her reasons in doing this is to help the men out with any kind of problems they are having in life. Nelson (Keanu) happened to be her November. He is a rude, arrogant man that doesn't care about anyone but himself. She helps him become a better person and they fall inlove for the first time in both of their lives. Little does Nelson know that Sara is ill. I will leave it at that because i don't want to give everything away.I would recommend this movie to anyone because it is great. Also, Jason Isaacs provides some comedy in this movie as well. He was fun to watch.
B000WGWQG8|4.0|I ordered this video hoping to be able to watch it with my eleven year old son. It was very well done and seemed to be historically acurate, however, there were parts that I felt were not suitable for kids.  These parts came in the later CDs of the series.
031606792X|1.0|I was so excited about this book and I literally went crazy when it came on Saturday. I finished it today and had to fight back the urge to cry. This was nothing like the other books in the saga. Where was the magic? All the way through it I had to keep reminding myself that it wasn't fanfiction. I feel ashamed to own it. The books I loved ended up with a completely stupid ending. Just because a book ends where everyone is part of a happy family and they all live happily ever after does not mean that it's \\"good\\".
1416550518|1.0|THE HOUSE AT RIVERTON was a big disappointment to me, pretty much from its opening chapter.  In its beginning I saw a good deal of similarity, hopefully unintentional, to the opening of the 1997 film \\"Titanic\\".  In RIVERTON, we have Grace, the nearly 100-year-old heroine, having to relive a pivotal event in her life because of the curiosity of a filmmaker.  Shades of Rose, the nearly 100-year-old heroine of \\"Titanic\\", reliving the pivotal event in her life because of the curiosity of the undersea treasure-seeker.<br /><br />Later in the story it also became apparent that Grace of RIVERTON would share with Rose of \\"Titanic\\" the experience of a woman breaking free from the mould they were expected to occupy and living their lives in dramatically different ways than expected of women of their time.<br /><br />But actually the author's usurping that particular theme didn't bother me as much as other unconscious (I hope), \\"borrowings\\".  As I continued to read RIVERTON I kept thinking:  \\"haven't I read/seen this somewhere before?\\"  And indeed, I had.<br /><br />In the Author's Note at the back of the novel, Ms. Morton references \\"Upstairs, Downstairs\\", the popular 1970's British TV serial. Reflected in the relationship between the characters of the maid, Grace, and the mistress, Hannah, were shades of the relationship between Rose and Elizabeth, and later Rose and Hazel (characters from \\"Upstairs, Downstairs\\").  Mr. Hamilton the butler, with his speeches on duty, loyalty to the Family and the invisibility of a good servant, could easily be Mr. Hudson, the devoted family butler from \\"Upstairs, Downstairs\\".  The character of Emmeline in her scatty, 1920's flapper phase could easily be Georgina from \\"Upstairs, Downstairs\\".  And so on...<br /><br />But even aside from this, I thought the plot stayed static and somewhat, I'm sorry to say this, blah.  I think I solved the mystery surrounding the death of the poet quite a while before the answer was revealed (this being the mystery that the filmmaker is investigating, with Grace's assistance).<br /><br />The author seemed to be trying too hard to evoke an era she loves; perhaps loves too much.  I didn't feel drawn into this story or into these characters' lives.  Old Grace/young Grace; Hannah; Emmeline, or the poet Robbie Hunter - they didn't strike me as being anywhere near *living* people; they remain shades of the author's imagination.<br /><br />For me THE HOUSE AT RIVERTON doesn't succeed as a \\"family saga\\"; as a \\"WWI drama\\"; as a mystery, or, most unfortunately of all, as an original, satisfying piece of fiction peopled with believable characters.investigating, with Grace's assistance).

031606792X|5.0|I couldn't imagine how the author could end this story in a satisfying way and had told myself I wouldn't buy the last one.  Yesterday, I weakened, bought it, and then sat and read it straight through.  I couldn't put it down!<br /><br />I don't want to give away the plot to anyone who hasn't read it yet -- there are too many nice surprises that should be discovered as you read it.  But I believe this is well written, well constructed, and contains a surprising end.<br /><br />I do agree with the criticism that Bells seems to have it all without adequate sacrifice -- but who cares??  There aren't too many happily ever after vampire stories, are there?  And this one truly is happy ever after forever.<br /><br />Thanks, for the lovely series, Ms. Meyer.  I hope you are working on your next book!
031606792X|2.0|I am so sad over this book.  I have been looking forward to it for far too long to be disappointed like this.  It feels like a betrayal.  There were parts that I did like, but over all it really broke my heart.  I kept waiting for it to be a dream sequence or a joke, but no sudden jerk awake or punchline.  I have read fan-fic better that this.  Its terrible.
031606792X|5.0|Spoilers below)  Although Breaking Dawn has left many people with a sour taste in their mouth I found the novel to be just as intriguing as the first three installments.  When I sit down to read a book, I want to be entertained and become immersed in a good story.  I want to feel my feet lift off the floor, and I want to see the tale unfold in my head like I was actually a spectator present.   What has Stephanie Meyer presented us with if not an interesting STORY?  Granted, the whole novel twisted and turned down an unexpected path, but what's a story without risk? Without shock? Without surprise?     Reading over some posts that are less than appetizing with their low star rate and passionate words seems to me a total contradiction. Obviously the book was able to evoke emotion and diversity out of its readers. Even if it was not a good story, those factors alone show that the novel made an impact. That in itself should be appreciated.    Many people have also criticized on the fact that the novel is totally off base and unreal (Ex. Bella having a baby with Edward). But yet they must realize the story is only fiction? As much as some would hope to believe, we do not live in a world filled with vampires, werewolves, and mythical creatures. So what's the problem if the story veers off even more from our reality? After all, these story's don't take place in our world. If Stephanie Meyer decides its possible in the world she has created, then I don't see the problem.     Also If you look back at the first three books, each one has been gradually becoming more fictional, loosing more and more factors of reality. Why not go all out in the final book? It only seemed right since the previous three were building up to this finale.     Here's another question. How else could it of ended? In the end didn't we want Bella to become an immortal or at least have a happy life with Edward? Jacob to find closure and a way to move forward after loosing Bella? Weren't WE looking for closure? In these cases the novel undeniably delivered. True it might not have been in any conventional way expected, but at least it was interesting. And yes, Bella does get more than everything she could have wanted in the end, but so what? Doesn't the character we've followed through three novels deserve nothing less?  I'm glad she finally got her happy ending!    Yet, here is what disappoints me most. With the understanding that these fascinating novels are FICTIONAL, and are only telling an epic STORY, why do some feel the need to apply them to real life? Society has made it so that when we see an 18 year old having a baby or getting married it's instantly reiterated as promoting teenage pregnancy or underage marriage. Now this is what feels off base to me. If after reading one of these books someone says \\"Hmm I'm gonna try to have a baby and get married just like Bella,\\" It seems to me that they have seriously misunderstood the concept of a fictional story.  In no way did it feel like Meyer was trying to promote anything but the story and love of her main characters.    All in all, I wish people could realize and appreciate the story Stephanie Meyer has told. I see this story as her baby. She developed it, created it, and most importantly shared it. How can we bash someone for going out on a limb to share the story she imagined in her head? I don't think you have to love it, because a lot of people won't-that's just opinion, but I think this work should be appreciated and is definitely worth the read.    So once again I'd like to say kudos to Stephanie Meyer for going against the grain of reality and sharing her captivating story with a very-hard-to-please audience.
031606792X|1.0|TERRIBLE! Such a let down after the first 3 books. I thought this was a JOKE. I've read better fan fiction than this.
031606792X|1.0|I waited for this book, because I wanted Meyer to show her stuff. Now I question her priorities. For her, apparently, the lack of alcohol and drugs and overt sex in the series makes it appropriate for the young adults who will be reading them. I would rather have had Bella smoke, get drunk, and have wild sex with Edward if that meant that Meyer could deepen Bella's character and complicate her decision to give up humanity. Instead, Meyer negates all complications and depth. Bella is perfect, and has been all along. She does not suffer for giving up humanity; instead, she makes the perfect vampire the very day she is created. Humans are so vapid in this novel that a human being gives up nothing for choosing to end her humanity. Vampires are the \\"clique\\" many hoped to belong to in Middle School, and they barely tolerate the presence of humans in their lives. Bella's earlier lack of communication and compassion for her human friends now makes complete sense. She's made it to the better clique; she did, the day she started school. The human friends have not. They can not, as they are inferior.     Compare this to the Harry Potter series, where \\"muggle\\" and \\"mudblood\\" applied to human beings were treated as racist, vicious terms. Where Rowling stressed that those who looked down on humans as inferior beings were wrong. Where Rowling encouraged us to judge others not by their overt powers, but by their inner strength and decency. Where no character was perfect, where everyone had to experience temptation and learn something about their imperfection and the consequences of their choices, even Dumbledore. Where Rowling repeatedly stressed love over power and beauty.     The more I write, the more angry I get at Meyer. I bought this for my daughter, and now I am furious that I did. I have no doubt that she will not \\"change\\" as a result of a novel that has less depth than the average Harlequin romance. I am annoyed as all hell that I had to accompany her to the midnight party, and spend the money on this piece of crap. I am disgusted that a capable author, and Meyer is capable, took a series with great potential, and tossed it in the garbage as she did.
031606792X|4.0|I can understand why people are upset with this book but I actually liked it. The plot was crazy and twisted, I agree, but it was more then I expected. I fully expected a really corny death ending. They die in each others arms during a fight with the Voturi or something. I liked the books unexpected twists. I like how it all ended happily with all the people getting what they wanted. Thank you Stephanie Meyers for not making it that corny.
031606792X|1.0|I have read and reread the first three books in this series with great pleasure.... maybe a little too much pleasure which led to sometimes neglecting more important things.  But what the heck, right?  We all need a little entertainment and the first three books were perfect for a little escapism.  The fourth? In the words of SM, \\"Holy Crow!\\"  What the heck happened? I won't bother restating everything that's already been said about how bad this book is, but I do appreciate reading the blogs --and lol at how spot on the criticism has been.  I feel slightly better now that I have had a chance to laugh at some of the funny comments. I can now toss this book in the  trash and move on with my life.... the spell has been broken.  I just never expected it would be by the same person who wove it in the first place.  Thank you Stephenie!  I can now go on with my life finally free from my Edward addiction.
031606792X|5.0|Don't read or listen to ANY of the spoiling bad reviews...I did before and wasn't very happy! Overall the book has some unexpected twists but is DEFINITELY better than many people are saying, so if you honestly think you will like it, chances are you will. Fabulous ending to a great series!
031606792X|5.0|I loved it!<br /><br />I can't understand some of these reviews. I mean SERIOUSLY. Do you truly want all the FICTION you read to reflect all the dissatisfaction of real life? Would the book truly have been better if everything didn't work out?<br /><br />Sure, life doesn't happen wrapped up in such a neat little bow, but this was NOT life. We're talking about vampires, werewolves (shape sifters), children of the moon, vampire/human hybrid babies that grow at amazing rates, and all manner of super natural powers...<br /><br />and yet people are complaining that it shouldn't be tied up in a neat bow because LIFE isn't like that?<br /><br />Gee. No kidding!<br /><br />I loved the book. I shut it with a sigh of contentment and completely pleased at the resolution.<br /><br />Wonderfully done, I say!!
031606792X|4.0|Though many people didn't seem to enjoy this book, I thought it ended the series well. It was a little too perfect of an ending with everyone getting everything they wanted, but satisfiying.   Alot of people seemed grossed out by Jacob imprinting on Nessie, but I don't see it as gross. They explained in previous books that Imprinting was different from love. Right now he will be he older brother, then best friend, then soul mate. I'm actually glad it worked out that way.   Things I didn't like about the book were Renesmee's name.. I mean come on.. how crappy of a name is that? That and there wasn't enough action.   Bella's power was kinda a cop out too.
031606792X|2.0|I will start by saying I am a HUGE Stephenie Meyer fan and have been since day one of Twilight.  The first three books managed to take readers to a whole new level of the vampire love genre and twisted them into a realistic point of view.  But unfortunately the final installment, I felt, fell short of the previous books.    *spoilers*    Instead of getting to read the grand finale of this epic vampire romance I felt more like I was \\"watching\\" an episode from Charmed or Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  I'm not saying the shows are horrible (for all the fans out there), I only feel that they lack in realism (yes, I know...they're not meant to be real but still...).  I mean, pregnancy?  Where did that come from?  I understand Meyer probably wanted to throw in a major twist but I really don't think that was the right way to go about it.  Others have pointed out, and I will agree with them, that some subtle messages in this book simply aren't right for the younger generations.  It really makes me wonder what the author was thinking tying up this beautiful story so sloppily.  I had thought she, and anyone else really, could stand more firmly on morals considering the first three books argued strong points such as the existence of souls and what is right and wrong.  Obviously having a child at the age of 18 is wrong (again, not trying to ruffle feathers here by rubbing people the wrong way-this is only my opinion).  I don't care how in love you are.  Bella's original \\"Don't want marriage.  Don't want kids.  Only want Edward for all eternity...\\" flipped you around in a 180 when all of a sudden-viola!  She was pregnant.  Well, darn that changes things...now Bella HAD to want this child unconditionally and didn't feel put out in the slightest!  What happened to Bella's thick headed personality?  I think the only one who \\"acted\\" accordingly to the situation was Edward himself.  And it seemed to me that Edwards \\"I have no soul\\" argument went flying out the window as it hardly even appeared in this book.  Wasn't that part of what made the others books stand out?    And Jacob.  While I LOVED that for a good portion of the book we got to listen to his thoughts, read his reactions first hand, and really get to know him better-imprinting on his first loves daughter is just...need I say it?  I will anyways, weird, wrong, twisted, and just plain weird.  I think the story would've felt more real had everything not been so neatly tied up.  Sure, we all want that happily ever after, who doesn't?  But, the way tensions built up in the third book I was expecting someone to take the blunt of all that was wrong with life and really make you feel for them.  That moment almost came when Bella \\"died\\" and Jacob nearly lost it with Rosalie and \\"Nessie\\" (I won't bash the name...I actually thought it gave this awful twist something humorous).  I honestly wanted Jacob to go out with a bang-or seemingly do so only to return towards the end with news of imprinting on someone else.    Oh, and I must mention all of those \\"see no evil\\" sex scenes.  I thought this was a teen read?  What I mean by that is that even if they weren't descriptively laid out it was horribly obvious that the hormones dominated a large portion of the story this time around.  I'll admit, the honeymoon was expected and even humorous but it was overdone throughout the story.  Sorry to dissapoint anyone but it does get annoying and I don't think there were many readers dying to get into the sex life of Bella and Edward.  Again, this only brings me back to the original problem behind this book-teen pregnancy.    My reasoning behind two stars is that while this book had its flaws it was still a rollercoaster of a read.  And while the idea of Bella being pregnant twisted the original plot oddly out of proportion it still delivered the dramatic \\"Change\\" that everybody was waiting for (though it didn't go as I had expected it to).  For those of you who are unsure as to whether or not to buy the book-I would borrow it from a library first to test the waters.
B000BISBDY|5.0|What can you say that hasn't already been said.  Johnny Cash is the Man, and he doesn't disappoint in this CD.  My husband has been playing the CD since we got it.
031606792X|5.0|This book is a good ending to an amazing series.  Some people may hate it because it has a different feeling from her other novels, but this is because this novel does not take place in the normal world like the other novels.  Others dislike it because they feel that she ignores the rules of her world.  She doesn't.  Mrs. Meyers explains her rules and theories effectively in Breaking Dawn.  Mrs. Meyer complete immersed us in the world of her vampires.  This supernatural world has many rules that readers weren't aware of before the novel.  But it is an enjoyable world to learn, and made me long for other books that center around this imaginative, supernatural world.      This is the ending that Stephenie Meyer said that she planned since before the novel Twilight was published.  I think everyone should approach it with an open mind and appreciate the story Stephenie Meyer weaves.
031606792X|1.0|I have read better fan fiction than this story. It is the worst book I had ever read. So very sad for us Twilight fans.   A very bad end to a wonderful series.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|After iffy seasons, the Season Three finale gave us a hint of things to come. A return to the strength of Season One. We were introduced to life after the Island, the needs of some to get off, and the freighter-tots. We also saw Ben's (Michael Emerson) human side at one point, but we knew that it was going to end badly for some. The mysteries of time travel were made even more present. And, at least for me, one word, baby, made it awesome, one word, KEAMY (Kevin Durand). We also saw someone that we all know.<br /><br />This all made for a very good season.
031606792X|5.0|I find it truly odd to read these negative reviews....these reviews were not what I was expecting at all!  Wow...How could so many readers completely miss the brilliance of this 4th book??  I am not, by a long shot, a romance novel reader.  It was simply curiosity that led me to pick up Twilight in the first place.  I am also way way past being a young adult reader...yet I was captivated by the love story between Edward and Bella.  S Myer is a fascinating story teller!  I had misgivings about even reading Breaking Dawn, wondering how Stephanie could possibly do justice to the first three books...what ending could honor what she had started?  The author was very up front with anyone who went looking even a little bit about her favorite books....Happy Endings!!  So many reviewers took issue with Bella's pregnancy, but I thought it was a brilliant way to get Bella all the way into the vampire realm...on her death bed, of course!  And I for one was blown away with how beautifully Myer handled the descriptions of Bella's experiences as a \\"new born\\"....Of course Bella's experiences were different - the mystical magic of love!  Romantic love, friendship love, family love....it was always the key for Myer, in my opinion....The kind of Love that can evolve even vampires and shapeshifting wolves.  Bravo Stephanie.  I loved it all.  Thank you :-)

B000F4LPJ6|5.0|This is a great, great movie.    There are lots of things that cinema can do, if it chooses. It can tell a good story (this movie does); it can develop cool, memorable characters (this movie does); it can explore themes and different ways of looking at life (this movie does); it can provoke a strong response, of love, fear, disgust, or anything else (this movie provokes several).    On almost every level, this movie challenges and entertains the viewer at the same time. We don't *need* to ask whether the island stands for greater society (or if we essentially teach our children to go out and butcher their friends, to \\"compete\\"), or anything vaguely academic like that, but we can -- the movie supports it. Or, we can just munch on popcorn, rock with the explosive action, shudder at the most horrifying/fascinating sequences, and wait to see who manages to come out of Thunderdome Isle.    If you're just looking for a thrilling shocker, or a film with some depth to it, Battle Royale stands ready to please.
031606792X|5.0|In waiting for this book to come out, I imagined many different ways this could've ended... I worried that it would be too predictable, that I would be disappointed in the simplicity of it.  But, as usual, Stephenie does things her own way!     I never could've imagined the places that this book took me. Each twist was unique. Her characters are true to who they are. I appreciate that Stephenie wrote a book that, once again, pushed the envelope and exceeded expectations!
B0010YSD7M|3.0|I did enjoy the DVD - but basically this would have been broadcast as a two part TV episode  -maybe three parts if they could figure out how to divide it into three parts.   The production values are simialr to the TV show.  For the next DVD - Continuum I think I would rather rent the DVD.
031606792X|1.0|Considering that Breaking Dawn is the end of the Twilight saga, I knew there would be a Hallmark-style tie up of loose ends. The plot travesty that ensued, however, has left a black spot on the series.     First, let me say, I did enjoy the first 80 or so pages. The wedding was fun to read about, and the honeymoon was just as enjoyable. However, when Bella became pregnant, the story lost its Twilight 'feel' for me.    In the past three books we have explored Bella's choices. Her choice to live in Forks, her choice to date a vampire and her choice to be best friends with a wolf, etc. These choices forced her to struggle with future problems that she may encounter, for instance never being able to see Charlie or Renee after the change.     This book, however, neatly wraps up all of Bella's choices in a nice bow, and seemingly hands her this perfect gift of life.     First, the idea of Bella having a child, when she in many ways is still a child herself, is preposterous. I don't recall in New Moon or Eclipse where Bella says she has to have a child. In some ways, she had a child already: Renee. I thought that part of her choice to become a vampire was that she would be forced to surrender some human moments, and giving birth was one of them.     Also, the idea that Jacob has imprinted on Nessie is insulting. We are expected to believe that the love triangle between Bella, Edward and Jacob, which has been brewing since Twilight, was a triangle only because Bella would be the mother to Jacob's heart-mate. So, we are now forced to believe that when Jacob kissed Bella in Eclipse, he was never in love with her, but instead an unborn egg inside of her. So, Bella never had to make a choice after all? She just needed to get knocked up with Edward's child.     Lastly, the Volturi conflict was ineffective. Since New Moon we have been led to believe the Volturi's would come after Bella, and that Aro wanted Bella, Alice and Edward at his side. In fact, with the conclusion of the Victoria's newborn army, it seemed that Breaking Dawn would be the Volturi's vs. the Cullen's. Although this is briefly described in a conversation, it never comes to a resolution. In fact, when the Volturi left, I felt that they would be on their way back to Forks in the next century for a show down.      Other concerns I have are the following:  1.) How did the good doctor, Carlisle, not figure out that Bella needed to drink blood while Nessie was still in the womb? He knew that Nessie was part vampire, because of the ultrasound not registering, how did he miss the blood nutrition?  2.) Rosalie and Bella become good friends, but is this a lasting friendship? To me, the friendship was a friendship of convenience and nothing more. Rosalie didn't change, nor did Bella.   3.) Bella lacked newborn thirst. This seemed to cheat the vampire system of overcoming the 'vegetarian' adversity.   4.) I'm an English teacher, so I'll be picky, but there were many grammar and spelling errors in the book. I can't blame Stephenie Meyer, because as a writer you're often too familiar with your writing and miss the errors, but I do chide her editors and the publisher for not double checking.      Maybe my expectations were too high for this novel, but I'm very disappointed with the outcome.
006054094X|5.0|I've been interested in different aspects of history for quite some time but the book, \\"1421: The Year China Discovered America\\" is the first to really light up my imagination!  Gavin Menzies' writing style is almost conversational making it an easy read but he has included enough references and quotes to thoroughly prove his premise that the Chinese discovered and mapped the world long before the European explorers \\"discovered\\" anything. I recommend 1421 to even the most casual history buffs as I believe his view of world exploration explains many of the questions that have been raised over the years.
031606792X|1.0|I should say first that this review contains spoilers!    SCROLL DOWN TO READ ...               I'd like to ask Stephenie Meyer what she was thinking about when she wrote this. So much of it disturbed me. Truthfully I wasn't expecting too much as these books have always been of the 'check your brain in at the door' type but this took that to a whole new level.     Bella gives birth to a mutant child that breaks her spine? Edward has to EAT it out of her? Is this Twilight or Rosemary's Baby?    Then Jacob IMPRINTS on this newborn child?  The implications of that alone is disturbing enough that I almost put it down.  The scene with Quil and Claire did nothing to make this whole imprinting less creepy. In fact it made it more so. Perhaps in the hands of a more skilled writer this could have opened up some very interesting psychological and sociological themes but Meyers does not really address any of that. In fact I found it disturbing in Eclipse when Jacob describes the imprinting process to Bella and Bella asks what if Claire rejects Quil upon becoming of age. Jacob dismisses this with a simple question: \\"Why would she do that?\\" (Paraphrased, I don't recall his exact words)  The idea of the child's free will is NEVER ADDRESSED AGAIN.    Until, Reneseme aka Nessie, a baby only a few days old starts referring to Jacob as 'her Jacob'.     I ... guess we're supposed to believe a newborn is capable of making such a decision? After tearing her mother's uterus apart and such at that.    I kept hoping it would get better, that there would be SOME redeeming value to all of this.     There wasn't.     The next JK Rowling? I think not.
031606792X|5.0|Okay, I have to admit that I was a little worried. I didn't get my book right away and I looked at the reviews and I couldn't believe it. I thought it was a joke. How could Stephenie Meyer get so thrashed by her supposed fans!? It just didn't make sense to me. Instead of burning my book (like so many of you rudely suggested) I read it with the hope that people were wrong. And boy were people wrong! I LOVED IT!<br /><br />Sure, it was different from the first three, but where would the story have to go if it weren't? It wouldn't have been so great if it was a direct match to the previous book. I was ready for new adventure and excitement, and I got exactly that! I can't even think of one thing I would change. In fact, it is stupid to think that things should be different! I think some people need to realize that without Stephenie Meyer there would be no Twilight Saga. It all comes down to what the author envisions, and who is to say what can or cannot happen in a world that we did not create and is ultimately not real? I think people should be ashamed of themselves. Turning on Stephenie so fast, and being so rude....it makes me sick! Where is the loyalty? Do you change your favorite football team just because they didn't make the Super Bowl? No! You wear your teams colors proudly and hope for the best the next season! I would think that fans would stick by the author with the realization that she could not meet everybody's expectations. So what if you don't think it went the way YOU thought it should! If you want a different version of Breaking Dawn, you are not a true fan of Stephenie Meyer.<br /><br />All in all, the series is fantastic and I can't wait for more of Stephenie's work.
031606792X|1.0|I would give this book 0 out of 5 stars if I could.    This is, without a doubt the worst book I have ever read. There was no plot, one-dimension characters, a build to a climax with no resolution, and poor writing in general.    First of all, this is not a children's book, and days after it's release I still see it in the children's section. This book is very graphic, and raises too many moral issues without any resolution or explanation. I would never recommend this book to anyone under the age of 14.    The first couple of chapters are good, but then it goes from bad to worse. Tension is built, problems arise but none are ever satisfied with a resolution. SM consistently takes the easy way out and creates \\"magical\\" solutions to every problem that arises. This continues to the climax of the book, where the Vulturi decide they were simply wrong and just leave.    The characters are almost new people, unrecognizable from the previous three books. This is not \\"growth\\" for growth implies a long and gradual process. This is more that the characters woke up and become completely new people without any explanation whatsoever. These new characters have no depth and consistently make questionable moral decisions without explanation.    The writing quality itself is unacceptable. Had this been turned in as an assignment in any creative writing class in the world, it would of received a failing grade. There is no structure, and I would consider it at a below high school writing level.    This book should have never been printed in the first place. It is a bad example of American literature and an offense to the written word. I am personally offended that I was sold this book that was supposed to be a quality ending to the Twilight Series. For those who have bought the book, return it; its the only message that can be clearly sent to SM, since now questions are being screen and approved during her book tour.     This book is beyond horrible, and I would not wish anyone, not even my worse enemy, the pain of having to read this disgusting excuse for a novel.
B00005R2IS|5.0|This movie is simply Meltastic and if you like Mr. Gibson at all...YOU MUST OWN THIS MOVIE!!!
031606792X|5.0|Just as many who have written before me, I deliciously enjoyed the final book to the Twilight saga.  As greatly anticipated, I was not let down by the wedding or honeymoon in the beginning of the book, nor the unexpected portions to follow.      I was slightly taken aback by some of the more adult themes of the book particularly Bella's pregnancy.  However, I do feel everything in the book was very fitting for the next step in the character's lives.    *During one interview, Stephanie Meyer did in fact state that she thought an age advisory should be placed on the books, and after reading them, I think that the publisher's should have taken that suggestion.       Many other reviews have dinged Meyer for the characters changing to much and the relationship between Bella and Edward changing.  However, I believe that is a true tribute to the characters and the relationships they each represent. As we all go through major life events we are going to change and evolve, so why wouldn't these characters? As a newlywed in my mid twenties, I could relate to a lot of these changes.  Additionally as someone who has debated whether or not to have children, this book has placed a new perspective on life and family.  Therefore, I am happy that Stephanie Meyer included all of these unexpected life events and plot twists.      If I were to give one criticism it would be that the story conclusion was rather \\"neat\\".  I agree that I wanted all of the loose ends to be tied, including Jacob imprinting on someone. However, I was disappointed that there was not more life loss, that the overall sacrifice was not greater.     With all of these thoughts in mind, I was very please with the storyline conclusions, the way the book was broken up by perspectives, and the overall writing.
031606792X|1.0|When I started reading the Twilight series I realized it wasn't the best written, tight bit of literature ever.  But the first book was a guilty pleasure, so I kept going with the next two.  I enjoyed New Moon far more than Eclipse and was ready to throw in the towel, except the wait was going to be short for the fourth so I stayed on.    I wish I could take it all back.  The books have always read like a 14 year old girl just discovered her first enthralling encounter with a fictional relationship and decided to write a fan fiction based on it, but this time it was ten thousand times worse.  It felt so much like one of those movie series where the first one was well-received, then all the original cast and crew decided to move on but some stupid movie exec decided to squeeze a couple sequels out of it and RUIN the whole idea.    Some pre-teens and young teenagers will probably love this book, and people who choose to live in a fairy-tale world in their heads.  But this book can't possibly pass muster with anyone who has half a mind to notice the terribly OOC characters, the shoddy writing, the extremely unrealistic situations (Yes!  Even for a book about sparkly vampires!), the entire destruction of characters so many people have grown to love.    Sometimes ideas that come to you in dreams should stay that way, a dream.

0739367676|2.0|CAUTION: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS            I haven't been able to make myself finish the book - so maybe in the last quarter, maybe(and hopefully) it pulls itself out of mediocrity. Other reviewers have gone into more detail about why the final volume of a nearly-great series is such a let-down. But I'll tell you why it breaks my own heart. One of the primary weaknesses I felt through all the books is the way Bella's other family members are so uni-dimensional and unimportant. Her mom and dad are both from Forks, so why don't they have any family friends, aunts, uncles or grandparents? And Bella's Dad is so conveniently stupid and obsessed with sports & fishing, so he can be tangential to the story. And although Bella moved to Forks as a gesture of love and sacrifice to her Mom, she is not very close to her, and she plays a very thin role in the first three books. In Breaking Dawn, Bella's family are completely negligible, to the point that it sort of makes me sick. Who cares that there are people who are out of their minds with worry about Bella? The author does not treat real human beings with any sympathy. Yuck.     The addition of an infant into the family... it creeped me out more than a little bit. But I object to this plot twist mostly because of the inescapable truth: after marriage and children, total boredom ensues. I haven't been able to finish the book mostly because it's so incredibly boring. Jacob imprinting on Bella's child... the only adjective I can come up with is: ikky. The child's human/vamp hybridization, and her speed-growth and special skills: ikky. And her dietary habits: beyond ikky, into the land of gag.       Ms. Meyer, could you please re-write Breaking Dawn from the beginning? I would very much appreciate it, and I would buy it again, with my fingers crossed that the second try would be better.

031606792X|1.0|I have to say \\"ditto\\" to most of what other's are saying who didn't like the book.   While I enjoyed reading the previous books, I always thought they were a little bit dramatic in the romance area.  This book's twist just seems like the author's immature desire to find a way for vampires to have a family.   It should have gone the route of a movie with a similar story - Tuck Everlasting - which had a bittersweet ending, but a happiness in the fact that human life, joys and sorrows are truly what is important in the end.  What really bother's me is that my 10 yr. old daughter keeps asking me if she can read these books because she is seeing & hearing things about them everywhere.   I've told her they are for older girls (meaning probably 16 & up), but after this, I don't really want her reading them at all.   Too weird and too much teenage fated love drama.
031606792X|1.0|is stephanie meyer on crack for writing this load of trash?! this must be a joke, wht a horrific ending...    SPOILER!!!    and seriously bella pregnant?! tht girl should not be allowed to reproduce! she cant even handle herself let alone a child!
031606792X|4.0|I thought Stephenie Meyer did a great job at tying all the loose ends and giving our Cullens/Swans and Quilette's the best ending she could give. The book is hard to take in at parts but I think that's because the reader is so  immersed in the characters. We all got to love these characters SO much. The thought of losing them, the thought of them betraying each other, the thought that this is indeed THE END of Bella and Edward's story gives us negative feelings, heartache etc to start with.     I see all the negative comments and believe if they were to read the book again with the knowledge of how it ends they will like it much better.    For me, this was the perfect ending. I got to love Bella as my sister/my daughter. I got to love the Cullens as my family and they will always be my favorite characters.    Thank you Stephenie Meyer for the ride. You are amazing, thank you for sharing your story with us...
031606792X|5.0|This was a fun enjoyable read.  The series was entertaining and I am very glad I read it. I am looking forward to reading other books from SM.
031606792X|5.0|What is so wrong with everyone that you dont like a happy ending? You have to remember the author knew what her ending would be when she first started writing it years ago so of course it is going to be HEA. The book has a perfect amount of surprises, the perfect amount of drama and action and of course love. This is a young adult fantasy love story but Bella is still Bella and Edward is still Edward. It had great and surprising ending for Jacob, a awesome ending for Bella and Edward and enough angst and tension to make the reader nervous about the outcome throughout the book (nervous about the outcome if you are not a fan of death and destruction, that is). Overall, fans of the love story of Bella and Edward should be very pleased.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I'm not sure why people are trashing this book... I thought it was an excellent ending to the saga. It is well written with intricate plot lines and is full of the twists and the constantly evolving relationships we have all come to expect from the Twilight saga. It is arguably more mature and dark than the previous three, but it is fantastic to see how Edward, Bella, and company deal with the pretty serious challenges they are faced with in this exciting conclusion. I devoured it as quickly as possible and was disappointed when it was over.
031606792X|4.0|I can't believe people are so critical of this book.  It is not as bad as people are saying it is.  Yes, there are a lot of different things going on in this book.  Yes, it is certainly different than the first three.  But I do understand why the author did what she did.  It didn't make me hate it.  In fact, I appreciate the happy ending.  After all we don't always get a happy ending in real life.  It is nice to be able to read about it in books.  Isn't that why we READ books, to experience things through other people's eyes.  I think Stephenie Meyer deserves Credit for what she has written.  It is a lot of work doing what she does.  And to top if all off she has to try and find a balance to please all of her millions of fans and herself as a writer.  I gave Breaking Dawn 4 stars for keeping me interested in it until the very end.  I didn't love it but I Certainly didn't hate it either.
031606792X|1.0|I absolutely LOVED the first three books. I read them in the span of a week and a half and just could not put them down. I am very dissappointed in this last book. I expected so much more to happen in the 700+ pages. I loved the tension and the passion between Edward and Bella. They seemed to love each other and found other ways besides sex to express that love. This book they are the exact opposite. I give SM credit for having Edward insist on marriage before sex but the none stop inuendo lust/sex maniac that Bella becomes after turning into a vampire seems unnecessary. Book four was easy to put down and I only finished reading it to see if it would redeem itself. It didn't. I will definantly read the other three again, but for me I think the series ends with book three.
031606792X|5.0|Okay I happened to adore this series, and while some people are having problems with the way the series ended, I loved it. I love that Bella finally came into her own, and Edward was finally able to hold nothing back. It was a true \\"Happily Ever After\\".
0071592466|5.0|This book is NOT a total TOEFL preparation book nor does it claim to be.  Look at the title!  It's for the speaking and writing sections only.  The book is small in size, but the pages have the same number of words as a \\"regular\\" text.  The book is filled with sample essays and speaking responses. The size is what it is because it's part of McGraw-Hill's \\"Perfect Phrases\\" collection. My students and I have really liked it.  There's nothing else on the market quite like it.
0141439475|5.0|Did the people who made the Frankenstein movie even read this book? All of the things that I associated with Frankenstein are creations of the movie alone. No Igor, no lightning striking the body, no grave-robbing (not directly referred to anyway), no mountain laboratory, no villagers attacking the castle to burn it to the ground. Just a young college student seized with a fever to see what he is capable of creating. What he creates is a monster so terrible to look upon, that he is disgusted and horrified and flees from it. The creature is not yet a monster and only wants to be loved and cared for by its creator. But as it is attacked and maligned purely on the basis of its horrific appearance, it becomes a monster and strikes out to destroy everything its creator loves. It's a real tragedy told almost entirely as a narrative without action. It was a tough read in spots, but well worth it. I'm a big classic horror movie fan, but after reading this and Dracula, I'm a bit appalled at how far they strayed from the original.
031606792X|2.0|I've waited for about 4 hours in line to get the book.  The adrenaline rush of finally being able to read the last part of the saga was overwhleming.  Screams were all around us and the high of the night was basically the hype of the book.  However, after reading the first few chapters up to 3/4 of the book, I gave up.  I can't keep on reading because I felt like I was reading a bad OOC fanfic.  Now, I'll just re-read the first three books just to compensate the wasted time of reading BD.  I still can't believe her characters became so detached to the original.  Edward and Bella's relationship deteriorated from the beginning of the book to the last chapter. My husband hid the book so I wouldn't throw it away.  I know it's a bit of an overreaction but it was really a true disappointment.  Probably, there are a lot of other fanfics out there with more of the original character feel than what Ms. Meyer wrote as the final saga of the series. Hopefully, this is all a joke.  I wish it was April Fool's day that day of Aug. 2.  sorry, stupid question but can an author retract a book?
0142000663|4.0|I only actually have to read this book as a Summer Reading assignment for my AP English class. I'm not a really a big fan of books that have this genre but when I reached halfway through the book, I started loving it. I find the feelings portrayed in this novel clear enough for me to understand it with the help of vague dialogue of the characters. A message is there and though you need to read more to understand what they're saying, the reality is always present.
031606792X|1.0|The other books were so bad that they were deliciously good, the kind you read at the beach.  This one? I couldn't finish it, it was so bad. I kept laughing!  I don't understand how this woman is making money!    I could go on but....don't even let your kids near this one. Sends the wrong message for young girls and is boring/terrible as hell for everyone else.
031606792X|5.0|I honestly do NOT understand all of the negative reviews for this book.  I thought it was absolutely amazing and easily the best in the series.  It's also one of the best books I've ever read...period.  Anything less than a 4-star rating is ludicrous.  You shouldn't give something a bad score just because certain characters don't end up with one another.  This book contains all the elements of fantastic piece of work.  There's suspense, action, love/romance, triumph, defeat, comedy...Breaking Dawn has it all.  As I stated at the beginning, the negativity surrounding this book is unfounded.  HIGHLY recommend!
031606792X|5.0|Sure its not perfect but stephanie myers did her job in finishing it a classy and new way. i love this series and the books in the series will always remain my favorite. =]
B000ULQV0W|5.0|This CD is amazing...the movie is awesome, it is an amazing story and the soundtrack really captures the essence of the story.  Having listened to the CD so many times, now I want to see the movie again to see where the songs fit in.  While the music can certainly stand on it's own, seeing the movie really increases its relevance.  Totally recommend....hands down.
031606792X|1.0|I've never been a huge fan of Meyer's writing, and that's probably putting it mildly, but at least the first three books in the series had a point. For Bella and Edward, it's been about the sacrifices you make for true love. In Eclipse, there was so much drama and indecision and we were left with the impression that Bella had made the ultimate sacrifice for love.    In Breaking Dawn, Meyer takes a total cop-out and cheapens the love story and what it ostensibly meant. In the end, Bella gives up nothing. She gets everything she ever wanted and more, she is not forced to choose between her human family and her (unrealistically perfect) vampiric life, or even between her love for Edward and her more platonic love for Jacob. She doesn't even have any of the challenges that newborn vampires usually face. I mean, we can go on about how Bella is a Mary Sue of the worst kind, but that has been true throughout the series. The biggest problem with BD on its own is that Meyer doesn't follow any of the conventions that she herself set up with the first three books. Nothing comes together and nothing makes sense.    Yes, it's a happy ending, but it's an impossible one, an overly-perfect one. Nothing is lost, there is no suffering -- it's just easy and cheap. And that's just plain lazy storytelling.
B0013AYRI2|4.0|I just finished downloading this album, one of my all time favorites, and I noticed that there are 14 tracks instead of 12. The Queen discography states 12. Amazon has included a repeat of I'm in love with my car @ 3:28 and You're my best friend @2:51. One is a second shorter and one is a second longer? Any idea why they would add tracks to this album?
B000KWZ7VU|5.0|This is what barenboim was born to do,its amazing how much better he is on the piano than conducting,from the first sonata to the last he masters them all,my favorite is the waldstein.I think hes always had a great understanding of beethoven even his conducting some of his symphonys, but this set is among the finest on disc.
031606792X|4.0|I entirely enjoyed reading the \\"Twilight\\" saga: the first two books held my attention and were hard to put down.  I must admit that I thought \\"Eclipse\\" was the last book in the series, until I wrote my review and discovered that a fourth was on the way.  I agree with some other reviewers that the saga would've been stronger if \\"Eclipse\\" had been the end.  All said and done, I did enjoy the entire series, but wish Meyer could've reached a compromise somewhere between the third book and this latest installment.<br /><br />What Stephenie Meyer has accomplished with the \\"Twilight\\" saga is fascinating: she's written immensely long books that take no time to read and breathed some life into vampire legends.  Yet with \\"Breaking Dawn\\" she seems to be fulfilling more her own gratification than that of her readers.  When left at the end of \\"Eclipse\\", Bella and Edward had reached a tenuous decision: he would make her a vampire, after they were married and she had gone to college.  Bella had finally seemed to have chosen Edward over Jacob, and Jacob had taken off, presumably out of the picture.<br /><br />\\"Breaking Dawn\\" picks up the story right where it left off, with Bella and Edward getting married and in store for an interesting honeymoon to say the least.  The story shortly diverts to Jacob's point-of-view, offering readers some interesting insights into his thoughts and feelings, allowing readers to see the action from an entirely different angle, perhaps offered as a bone for those who prefer Jacob Black.  The story reverts back to Bella as narrator, after she has been changed and is exploring her newfound strengths. Yet even with the strange twists Meyer throws in, the plot seems formulaic - a danger they must face in a large-scale showdown - is cleverly resolved, but rather drawn out.<br /><br />I must admit that I wasn't expecting too much from \\"Breaking Dawn\\".  While it was just as readable and enjoyable as the previous three, I knew events would unfold whether I wished them to or not.  Having Bella get everything she wants resolves all of the tension and contradiction the previous three examined so successfully.  There are almost too many happy endings here to seem realistic, even for a book based on supernatural beings.  Stephenie Meyer is a gifted storyteller, and I read a quote from her that the books have gone on so long because she had a hard time giving up Bella's humanity.  I wish she would've struggled a little more with that issue.  Readers, especially younger ones, should know that \\"Breaking Dawn\\" is a much more grown-up book than even the previous three have been: hopefully there's some discretion as to who is reading this.  While Meyer is never explicit, there are certainly some scenes that ought to raise eyebrows, since this is considered a young adult book.aving Bella get everything she wants resolves all of the tension and contradiction the previous three examined so successfully.

031606792X|1.0|I did not go into these books expecting Shakespeare.     Nevertheless, I was expecting some type of evidence that editors were involved. A few grammatical errors can be chalked up to human mistake but having Bella make Charlie pancakes and then 13 lines later having him look into a cereal bowl is ridiculous.     I was also expecting a happy ending. I did not however, expect Bella to get absolutely everything she wanted. She married Edward, they finally had sex, she gets a family, Jacob gets to be a part of that family, the Volturi leaves in the biggest snoozefest of a climax that I have ever read. A perfect life is not what I want to read about.    Stephenie Meyer can do better.
031606792X|5.0|I loved that everything turned out perfect,it almost never happens in books and when it does people call it \\"bad literature\\".  I was very satisfied that Breaking Dawn could have the predictable happy ending with enough twists to make it unpredictable. I do not agree that you must suffer to have happiness.(I can see the real world outside my window everyday).   I love a story of hope, the possibility of escaping heartache and, striving to avoid conflict.  Thank You Stephanie.
031606792X|2.0|I was pretty disappointed. If the author wants to write sci-fi, she should've stuck to doing her sequel to The Host. I was not at all thrilled w/her twists. It read like fan fiction. PLEASE GOD don't do this to Midnight Sun!!!
B000YDOOUK|5.0|ok first of all we get it, theres an AC/DC influence but not everybody needs to say it, this album will blow past any expectations i dont care how high your standards are, this is straight up pure rock n roll PERIOD!!! they have there very own MUCH NEEDED sound as well its good to hear that not everybody is following the Nickelback path and blending in. These guys are the real deal they are probably the only band out right now that sounds like 70's and 80's pure rock, and what sets them apart from the 70's, 80's sound is the good idea of leaving the ballads out. and what seperates them from this generation is the fact they dont blend in with every band on the radio which is why these guys stand out, but dont take my word for it just buy the damn album!!!
B000BB1MIC|5.0|Hyperbole? No. Gilmore Girls is one of those rare creations on TV or any media really where the characters are so well fleshed out they are real. I can not draw. When I try to draw a human face it ends up looking like a cat drew it or a 2-year old. Most TV is that way. Characters are distorted, lamed-down, absurd imitations of human beings. Quite depressing actually. It is why I read or watch sports.<br /><br />Once in awhile lo and behold REAL PEOPLE on TV. Quirky people. Quirky people who are belivable. The main characters are flawed, intelligent, interesting, amusing, and aware. The quirky supporting cast is just as believable and endearing.<br /><br />This year we get to see Rory dealing with relationships on a deeper more emotional level both with boyfriends and her mom. And there is more Luke and Lorelai together. Good stuff.<br /><br />There has been talk of a Gilmore Girls movie filling in the time since we last have seen them. Also talk of Alexis not wanting to do it. It doesn't matter. Once you get hooked on the series you will know these characters as well as the writers and the actors. And that is some mighty fine writing to achieve that.<br /><br />The Emmys should be ashamed of itself. The series was virtually over-looked except for a 'statue' episode. Almost nothing receiving an Emmy the forst years of the new decade could come close to this. Series is so good I gave it a 5 but it should as a DVD be closer to a 4 or even a 3. Not a lot of extras. Fans deserve more when they shell out money, especially as many have watched the episodes before.<br /><br />But if you want to introduce someone new to them or watch them commerical free whenever you want. Or just have them on hand when a child is old enough to watch them, good buy.
031606792X|4.0|Breaking Dawn is not nearly as good as Twilight, but that doesn't make it a horrible read.  Stephenie Meyer ended the book that way SHE wanted to, not the way her fans wished her to.  I have to respect that.  She took a risk and created a new, more adult level to the series.  I liked the idea that Edward and Bella finally end their suffering.  They are happy, and for some reason the fact that this book isn't filled with adolescent angst seems to really bother alot of her fan base.  I found myself laughing and crying in this book. That's what matters.  So, Bella, Edward, and Jacob didn't have their big, dramatic love-triangle explosion.  SO WHAT?  Instead, Meyer introduces the character of Nessie and still manages to further the compainionship between the vampires and the werewolves.  This book has Edward and Bella moving toward their life together as adults.  Perhaps that's what bothers some of the readers.  Then again, perhaps not.  The only thing that I am sure of is that it is a great read that gives Meyer a great oppurtunity to continue on with the Twilight mythos.    Don't miss out on this book because others wanted Meyer to end it THEIR way.
1401207529|5.0|Frank Miller put together the best re-telling of the beginnings of Batman. From the death of Bruce Wayne's parents, all the way through his first tenuous year as a crime fighter. You can see where a lot of Batman Begins was inspired by this piece of work. It's the first graphic novel I was ever given, and would make a valuable addition to your collection.
B000J10EQU|4.0|I liked the movie and thought Brandon Routh did a good job. One question though with Spoiler Alert...if this movie is to be viewed as a continuation of the Superman I & II storyline, how is it that Lois can whisper into Superman's ear while in the hospital that he has a son (my assumption of what was whispered based on the subsequent events)? If, in Superman II, Lois received the \\"kiss of forgetfulness\\" (Lester version) or Superman, once again, turns back time (Donner version), then how is it she remembers sleeping with Supe's at all?
0930289234|4.0|While this isn't my absolute favorite graphic novel, it isn't even my favorite Alan Moore piece. I have a healthy respect for this piece because it is the most celebrated graphic novel of all time. The fact that it's the only graphic novel on Time Magazine's list of the 100 Greatest Novels since 1923 should speak for itself, because this piece has layers on top of layers of meaning and really shows what \\"comics\\" can really be.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|The seven seasons which make up \\"The West Wing\\" was the greatest television show in history. Well don't take my word for it take the numerous emmy nominations and wins it won. Lets break down why this show worked so well.<br /><br />- Aaron Sorkin brilliantly interwove banter in a usually boring political setting.<br /><br />- The cast was brilliantly picked and worked very well together. Each cast member had their own story lines which gave us a taste of what these very public figures were dealing with in their personal lives.<br /><br />- The show had amazing guest stars and always brought back key guest stars through out the seasons with out casting different actors to portray said parts.<br /><br />- The story lines were actually believable and gripping as well!<br /><br />- There was no bad season (Of course there were episodes that were better than others but each season stands on its own)<br /><br />- The show has a powerful and fulfilling series finale.<br /><br />- The show was just written well.<br /><br /> I enjoy this show so much and never tire from watching it over and over again. It's rare when a show like this comes along and we are lucky to have seven full seasons.<br /><br /> The show focuses on the presidential term of democratic president \\"Josiah (Jed) Bartlett\\" and his senior staff as they run the white house and the United States Of America. The show begins in the second year of his term and follows his term through campaign re-election, an assassination  attempt, the kidnapping of his daughter, the assassination  of a foreign leader suspected of being a terrorist, numerous scandals involving his senior staff and the rocky relationship with his wife the first lady all the way through the swearing in of the next president. And these are only a few of the events that take place throughout the series. Now you may think, \\"How unbelievable!\\" but you will be amazed at how well these story lines play and believable they are. You will laugh, you will cry, you will get angry and you will cheer but more than anything you will not forget the impact this show made in television history. Welcome to \\"The West Wing\\".ll not forget the impact this show made in television history. Welcome to \\"The West Wing\\".
1563894696|5.0|This is probably one of the first stories that really showed Harvey Dent as a tragic figure in the Batman universe rather than some demented villain with a duel identity issue. The Long Halloween probably did the best of showing the relationship of Batman, Jim Gordon, and Gotham's DA Dent. That is of course until The Dark Knight came in theaters. However you can see where pieces of this story inspired the feature film.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I saw \\"Wicked\\" at the Pantages in Los Angeles yesterday and it was marvelous. I couldn't help comparing the leads to this CD which I have owned and played relentlessly since I first saw \\"Wicked\\" in 2006. The L.A. stars acquitted themselves quite well. And proof that synchronicity lives in The Emerald City, Elphaba the green witch was played brilliantly by a Cali belter by the name of Teal Wicks.<br /><br />Honorable mentions go to \\"No Good Deeds\\" \\"Defying Gravity\\" \\"As Long as You're Mine\\" and \\"For Good\\". My very favorite (this month anyway) \\"Thank Goodness\\" got a rather tepid response from the matinee audience though Erin Mackey as Glinda hit the high notes with gusto and on other tunes like \\"Popular\\" she matched the ditzy, surgary acting chops of Kristin Chenonweth.<br /><br />Norbert Butz's Fiyero bested Derrick Williams, the L.A. star in the tenor and emotion of his voice. I loved the fact that there was no mention of Fiyero as being an African American. But who can make a fuss when the star of the show is a green woman?<br /><br />Williams played the role with an over the top comedic flair that worked well in \\"Dancing\\" but it was hard to take him seriously during his declaration of metaphysical love in the poignant duet \\"As Long as Your Mine.\\"
031606792X|5.0|I read the book and really enjoyed it.  The middle section was a little weird for me, but otherwise the book was a fun read and hard to put down.  While I've got a few teeny complaints (seriously, Reneseme???), it's a good story, and nice to see a happy ending for once.
B000SMWUPS|4.0|I really like this, for holding my drinks and a few essentials, I combined it with a mesh bag to a hang off of my European Stroller that does not have any storage for Mom or Dad. The mesh bag also has cup holders, but I do not trust them. This one is nice and sturdy and works well, even on cobblestone roads that we walk often here in Germany. The storage area in between the cup holders is small, not enough for all the stuff I seem to carry with me, enough for some keys and mabye a small wallets, but like I said, it is easily combinable with another storage bag. And it does fit a Venti Starbucks cup. Great products.
031606792X|5.0|For all those that didn't like this book, I am not sure why.  Yes, it is a neat tie up but J.K. Rowling did the same with Harry Potter.  People WANT a happy ending.  I thought it was creative-I didn't see a lot of the twists and turns coming.  No spoilers here- It is a MUST READ if you love the first three.
031606792X|2.0|No need to repeat what's been said over and over again -- but even for a \\"fantasy\\" book, this one was over the line.  ***SPOILERS***    There is no great happy ending without sacrifice.  Except in this book, apparently.  The author spent a good deal of time creating a world whose rules she felt she could break.  The author spent a lot of time making readers think that Bella would have a hard choice and/or a big sacrifice, but she didn't.  And the whole Jacob imprinting on the baby was just W.R.O.N.G.  Not the age thing... the \\"replacement woman is the daughter of the original woman\\" thing.      I gave it 2 stars because of the parts narrated by or containing Jacob (and I was Team Edward, btw).  His was pretty much the only voice that stayed true to the nature of the character.  Didn't care about Bella or Edward much at all and the rest of the crew? -- just pages of fluff.    If you must read it - get it from the library.
031606792X|5.0|I finished the novel in twelve hours, and I must say that I was surprised by much in it.  I have also read some of the reviews, and I tried to think it over looking at the story from the one-star perspective.  I must say that I can't see their point.  Firstly, the message I got was not that it was okay to have lots of sex and a baby and that makes a good life.  I think the moral was get married and then sex becomes better, along with if you make a child, you have to deal with the consequences of having done so.  The trouble with the youth of today is that they have sex without much of a commitment to their partner, and then, they have a child without entirely accepting the changes that come with it.  My mother was eighteen when she married, and she had me when she was still quite young by today's standards.  She told me how her view of the world and her purpose in it changed with a child; she became a different kind of person, and that is how I saw the change in Bella as a natural effect of having another life depend on her.  Bella had always been protective of the ones she was with and most especially towards those she loved.  Remember the third wife in Eclipse, and how that story effected Bella?  Yea, she had some very immature moments, but we all do, really.  Yea, the Jacob thing was kind of a shock, but to me it fit somehow.  (Remember Emily, Sam and Leah?)  To me, Bella was never just defined by Edward any more than he was defined by her, and this was no exception.  Her life was complete with him and Nessie in it, but that was not going to be her entire life.  It is too early in it to say what she is going to do with all of her time anyway, and it never says that she isn't going to college so who knows?  Anyway, I always thought that there was more to the supernatural world than Bella understood or know about, and I was right.  There is so much to explore in this world that I doubt that this is the end of the Twilight books really.  Maybe of Bella and Edward'smain story, but there are other characters like Nahuel that I am really curious about.  Given time, I am sure we will meet up with the characters we have come to love and the ones we have only just met again.
B0019IB26I|4.0|This captures Mayer where he is most comfortable, on stage. You can tell he is having a great time and so is everyone in the audience. I saw him in Indy and the show is even better in person. This is a very good albumn.
031606792X|1.0|I do realize that this is a young adult book, and it was written for a certain audience, but in my opinion it glorifies violence, was poorly written, and I was completely unable to relate to the characters. Bella and Edward have an unrealistic love affair--which now young girls will think is normal. Edwards is completely controlling of Bella, which bothered me. He is always \\"protecting\\" her and never lets her make her own decisions. Jacob tries to manipulate Bella into loving him--and wins, in a way. Control and manipulation are not part of a healthy relationship. Yes, I do think the parallel between blood thirst and sexual desire was interesting, but taken entirely too far... when the readers start to pick up on the underlying sexual sadism of the thirsty vampires, Bella herself starts to think about drinking the blood of her own father.   Meyer tried to boil it all down to \\"love conquers all\\", but I was too distracted by the wandering plot and long, boring mind conversations. I'd suggest rereading Harry Potter instead of the Twilight \\"saga\\", Rowling succeeded in creating a compelling, layered and creative story for young readers; Meyer failed miserably.
075640407X|4.0|I was surprised to find that, instead of the epic fantasy of myriad plots and characters that the first chapter or so led me to think I was getting, what I had was essentially a biography! For a simple storyline, yes, it could probably be done faster. But here's what surprised me - though the book was long, the plot occasionally slow and redundant - I was never. ever. bored.  Not for one page.  Rothfuss' writing is such that even a slow part feels more like it's been \\"lovingly detailed\\" than \\"badly done.\\"  I found Kvothe to be a very compelling character - his naivete and his cleverness combine believably. I began to mourn his losses, celebrate his little victories, and groan over his blunders.  Is it long? Definitely. Is it too long? No.  Read and enjoy.
B0015DYIH2|4.0|My daughter nagged relentlessly until I agreed to read the Twilight series, just to get her to be quiet. I enjoyed the books more than I expected I would, though I never fell into the madness of Twihardism.<br /><br />Breaking Dawn provides an obvious conclusion to the Twilight saga, following the logical progression of a modern fairy tale: Bella ends up with everything she wanted and some things she never knew she wanted.  This seems to bother the die-hard fans, but think for a moment about the contemporary Cinderella story:<br /><br />(1) Girl meets hardship (or makes a self-sacrificing choice)<br />(2) Girl meets metaphorical knight in shining armor<br />(3) Knight saves girl from physical harm (repeat as necessary)<br />(4) Girl saves knight emotionally<br />(6) Comeuppance for evildoers<br />(7) Happy endings for everyone else<br /><br />The happy ending is a foregone conclusion. The journey getting there is what makes the story interesting and Breaking Dawn doesn't disappoint on that level.<br /><br />There's been a great deal of complaining about the message of the story, which causes me to wonder if perhaps some people have difficulty distinguishing fantasy from reality. Though it is quite possible to tell a morality tale though fantasy, the genre is best suited for exploring things we would never wish to experience in real life. The characters aren't portraying an ideal lifestyle for readers to emulate; they're just doing things to move the plot forward. It's unfair to assume that the characters' opinions and actions have any meaning outside of the pages of the story.  The message of the story is simply that it's entertaining to vicariously experience imaginary characters doing things that are radically different than your real life.<br /><br />For those who insist on a deeper message to live by, I suggest that you preface the thought with, \\"When a trustworthy clairvoyant guides you and your love interest is vampire 86 years your senior, it's perfectly acceptable to...\\"
031606792X|1.0|I was terribly disappointed by Breaking Dawn and not to mention completely disgusted with the pregnancy scenes and birth scene. I felt Bella's reaction to her pregnancy was totally contrived and not in character at all. Bella is an incredibly immature and dramatic eighteen year old who does not have the emotional capability to raise a child.  Did anyone also notice that she pawned her child off on her family members all the time? She only paid attention to her child when it was convenient for her and would not interfere with her love life with Edward. Bella did not grow emotionally through any of her experiences.     Some people mentioned that this book delved deeper into Vampire mythology and ancient legends. I did not see proof of any research by Stephanie Meyers and she changed her own legends for when it was useful for her plot.     I could not forget the entire time while reading that a possible Mormon agenda was being pushed on the readers.  I wonder what sort of messages this book could be sending to young girls who are reading. I was amazed that Meyers did not have one of her characters (Carlisle, a doctor) explore the possibility of a pregnancy, which seemed completely obvious to me when I realized Bella and Edward had unprotected sex. This lack of information is obviously a contrived oversight. Bella was obviously not ready to have a child because she mentions to Edward that she wants to attend college. Meyers never discusses Bella's disappointment in not  attending Dartmouth, in lacking those life experiences and loosing out on further intellectual and developmental growth. She seems to believe that a husband and child can make up for this loss. I believe knowledge is power and girls should hear the real deal about safe sex. Meyers should think about what messages this book is sending kids about sex when their idealized character leaves behind sense and judgment for her teenage hormones. I work in an independent bookshop and I will not be recommending this book to thirteen year olds.
B001CXW8CW|3.0|Christian Bale is such a moron of an actor. This is the only movie ive ever watched where i sincerely wanted the bad guy to win. Heath Ledgers performance was the only thing that held this movie together. The transformation from harvey dent to two face was so stupid. He went from sincerely wanting to help gotham to being a cold blooded criminal just cuz the girl died. This movie did NOT deserve the hype and explosion in the box office that it got and if Heath Ledger was still alive I dont think it would have been as big as it got.
0743455967|3.0|After finishing this book, I wasn't quite sure how I felt about it.<br /><br />It is seperated into three parts. The first are some brief snapshots of the author's life. Telling memories from his childhood, early jobs, first book publication, and even descent into addiction. The second part is strictly about writing. These are the pages that I found had trouble keeping my attention. The third section talks about his accident. He was hit by a motorist while walking on the shoulder of the road. He describes his experience in suprising detail.<br /><br />When he shines a light on his own work, giving us an inside perspective on the books we've already, it is extremely interesting. When he is talking about the use of adverbs, not so much.<br /><br />I understand that this is a book about writing. Myself not being a writer I wasn't fully able to enjoy it in its entirety. This book isn't off limits to you if you are, like myself, simply a constant reader. However, you should temper your expectations.
031606792X|3.0|I love the Twilight series and was really looking forward to the release of Breaking Dawn, but to be honest, I was a little dissapointed after reading it.  The first three books managed to transition well from one to the next, but this one almost felt like it was from a different series.  Maybe the book felt like it didn't fit with the others as well was because part of the story is told from someone else's perspective, or perhaps it's because there was so much story fit into this one book that it felt like a bit of an overload.  If it was an independent book that wasn't part of the Twilight series I would have liked it better, but because it was part of the series and I had certain expectations, I thought it was just ok.
0440237688|5.0|This book is one of the most thought provoking stories that I have ever read! I read it when I was in the 6th grade and I didn't get it... only after reading it again in highschool did I really see the wonderful creativity of this book.
031606792X|3.0|Wow.  I was totally taken a back by this book.  I was an instant fan from the first few pages of Twilight.  No.  I was a fanatic.  Quite obsessed if I dare to tell the truth.  I even loved New Moon.  No matter how much the story veered from where I wanted it, it was a good book.  So, I was on edge to get Break Dawn.  I had it in my hand just after midnight as it came out.  I took it home, and started reading.  I had to stop.  I couldn't tell if it was the book, or my lack of sleep that was keeping it from seeming right.  It was the book.    **Potential Spoiler Warning**  Breaking Dawn veers far, far from the kind of writing that Stephenie Meyer is known for.  The first two books within are absolutely far too rushed.  It reads as though it is a synopsis, and not the book itself.  I believe there was a rush to edit a few hundred pages, and this was not the way to do it.      The third park, Bella's Book again, is finally back to at least the style of the other books.  It sounds familiar.  It reads familiar.  It isn't bad.  Ir could be good, if only it hadn't been tainted by both the bad story line, and the terrible writing of the first two books.      My sincere hope is that there is a re-edit, and Stephenie Meyer is allowed another few years to go back, re write the portion that was so poorly written, and then there is a re release.  I will wait, and I will re read it.  I know she can't go back and change the plot.  I can even live with, or learn to love the plot, should it be written better.  Without a serious second look from the author, the book is certainly a failure within the series.
031606792X|1.0|This is the worst book to end a series I have ever read.  Did SM have enough money and just throw something together.  It didn't even seem like she wrote the book.  It was a waste of time.  My 23 year old daughter, who loved the first book, agrees with me.  If you haven't read it...don't bother.
B0012X3ZGK|5.0|Every track totally rocks, is mixed well, and the bluesy hard rock sounds great mid-tempo, or any other tempo,contrary to other reports. Some of the extra tracks are really cool to hear for the sake of variety, but a few live tracks just don't keep up with the rest of the tracks in quality. There are some slower tracks on the original set of this album, but these still rock out, compared to their earlier albums with slow tracks.

0691131511|4.0|Because the Byzantine Empire lasted 1,129 years (from Constantine's founding of Constantinople in 324 AD to Sultan Mehmet II's capture of the city in 1453), the historian writing about the empire faces a daunting task. Write about it in the traditional chronological manner, and space limitations will force a laundry list approach with little meaningful content.<br /><br />What Judith Herrin (a professor of Late Antique and Byzantine Studies at King's College, London) has elected to do instead is to break the subject down into 28 topics under 4 general subject headings and then deal with each topic chronologically:<br /><br />I. FOUNDATIONS OF BYZANTIUM<br />  1. The  City of Constantine<br />  2. Constantinople, the Largest City in Christendom<br />  3. The East Roman Empire<br />  4. Greek Orthodoxy<br />  5.

Icons, a New Christian Art Form<br /> 10. Iconclasm and Icon Veneration<br /> 11. A Literate and Articulate Society<br /> 12. Saints Cyril and Methodios, `Apostles to the Slavs'<br /><br />III BYZANTIUM BECOMES A MEDIEVAL STATE<br /> 13. Greek Fire<br /> 14. The Byzantine Economy<br /> 15. Eunuchs<br /> 16.

The Siege of 1453<br />  Conclusion: The Greatness and Legacy of Byzantium<br /><br />The core of the book consists of 333 pages, which means that each topic is limited to an average of 12 pages. As a result, the writing is information-dense, slowing the reader's progress. Additionally, the author's writing style is academic (i.e., somewhat tedious), although the shortness of the chapters makes reading the book manageable.<br /><br />There are 41 photographs of varying quality, many in black and white.

Paul Getty Museum)]].<br /><br />As the above discussion suggests, this is a book that will primarily interest an academic reader.

031606792X|2.0|I feel terrible about giving this book a two-star review, mainly because I've loved the series so much up until this point.  I was ecstatic last week knowing that the time was almost up and I would be able to read Breaking Dawn.  I went to the midnight release party - which I've NEVER done before in my life, I'm almost 29 years old.  My 43 year old sister went with me and she was just as excited.  I was home by 12:30am and stayed up until 8:00 am reading on Saturday, until my eyes were crossing and I had to sleep, but the minute I woke at 12:30pm I began reading again.  I was finished by 3:00pm on Saturday.  At first I didn't know how to feel, it was such a STRETCH for me, the direction the book went in - and it didn't have the heart of the previous books, where was the passion and love and intensity between Bella and Edward that was demonstrated so beautifully in the other books, I was sorely disappointed in that they seemed like shadows of themselves.  Edward wasn't Edward, he seemed like a bit player in this story ... as was Bella, all weekend I continued to describe them as \\"Bella & Edward Lite\\" or \\"Diet Bella and Edward\\" ... and the baby ... WTF?!  I keep seeing images in my head of the scene in Spaceballs or Alien when the little monster comes out of the guy's stomach.  Overall, I'm just sad and disappointed.  I know that this must hurt Stephenie Meyer to see her fans so upset by this book, but unfortunately, it is what it is.  It could have been so wonderful, but it seemed rushed and without the depth of feeling of the previous books.  It speaks volumes to me that so many people are returning their copies and are so upset.  So far, the book is scoring 3 stars on Amazon when LITERALLY - every one of her other books are 4.5 stars - that says something right there.  Anyway, just wanted to add my two cents.  I still love Stephenie and what she has done for bringing a little more romance and love back into literature, but this book should be put in the furthest corner of the bookshelf and allowed to gather dust.  I certainly won't be reading it again as I have the others - and it's just a shame.

B0000YB7Z8|5.0|English prog rockers Jethro Tull's double live album Bursting Out was released in September of 1978.<br />The Bursting Out album was recorded on the band's 1978 European tour in support of their excellent but underrated album Heavy Horses. This album captures the lineup of lead singer/songwriter and flute player Ian Anderson, guitarist Martin Barre, keyboard player John Evan, drummer Barriemore Barlow, orchestrator/keyboard player David Palmer (now known as Dee Palmer) and bass player the late John Glascock at the top of their game.<br />We begin with Introduction By Claude Nobs who was one of the top music promoters in Europe. We follow with a stellar intro which gives way to a rocking version of the Heavy Horses album track \\"No Lullaby\\" which is a superb version. We follow with \\"Sweet Dream\\" which rocks alot harder than the studio version. We then have an acoustic portion starting with an excellent reading of \\"Skating Away On The Thin Ice\\". Next is an excellent version of \\"Jack In The Green\\" which is always one of my favorite Tull tunes. We then end the acoustic set with another track from the Heavy Horses effort being \\"One Brown Mouse\\".<br />The second side of the album start with an excellent version of \\"A New Day Yesterday\\" which has a harder edge than the studio version. Next we get to hear Ian's impressive flute playing on \\"Flute Solo/God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen/Bouree\\" and proves why he is rock's greatest flute player. We then have a short but powerful version of \\"Songs From The Wood\\". We end the first disc of this stellar two disc album with an excellent but condensed version of \\"Thick As A Brick\\". This version rivals the live version from Madison Square Garden found on the TaaB remastered CD from 1998.<br />The album's second disc and third side starts with an Introduction By Ian Anderson which then goes into a powerful version of the Songs From the Wood album cut \\"Hunting Girl\\" which is a killer rocker. Next is an excellent version of the title cut to 1976's Too Old To Rock and Roll To Young to Die. Next is the instrumental called \\"Conundrum\\" which is the drum solo spot from virtuoso drummer Barlow proving why Barriemore is an excellent drummer and Martin Barre's riff here showed why he is a great, yet underrated, guitarist. The title cut to 1975's Minstrel In The Gallery is next and is a great version.<br />The album's last quarter begins with an excellent and heavy version of \\"Cross Eyed Mary\\". Next is another exclusive instrumental \\"Quatrain\\" which is driven by a killer riff by Barre. We then follow with a killer version of the title track to 1971's Aqualung and is the best version I ever heard though the version from the 1981 video Slipstream (which is a bonus DVD on the remastered re-issue of 1980's A album/CD). Next is a great version of another classic \\"Locomotive Breath\\" which just rocks. We end with \\"The Dambusters March\\" which gives way into an instrumental which rocks and a reprise of Aqualung to end the album.<br />Bursting Out upon release reached the US Top 20 and went Gold immediately and rightfully so as this live album just kicks arse beginning to end.<br />The original US 1990s CD release wrongfully and inexplicably deleted Sweet Dream, Conundrum and Quatrain and much of the stage bantering to fit the album on one CD but this remastered 2-CD set released in 2004 restores the full album to its full length and how one first heard it when they either owned the LP or cassette or 8-track cartridge issue. If you want one live Tull album in your collection, Bursting Out is where to go for the best live Tull performance available.<br />HUGELY RECOMMENDED!To Rock and Roll To Young to Die.

031606792X|3.0|Well, I just finished the fourth and final book. It took me by surprise I can tell you that. When I was waiting at midnight for the book, I was surprised by the other people's ideas on how the book would turn out. Nothing was even close to this! Sure people thought or knew, rather, that she'd be turned into a vampire but really, a pregnacy. Here are, in my opinion, the cons of this book:     1.) The whole sex, pregnancy baby vampire thing, Logically I don't see that happening, but if I did, isn't it strange, like really strange?   2.) When Edward ask Jacob for his help when talking to Bella about the baby to change her mind, didn't that seem perverse?   3.) Well I'm glad like in anyother fairtale they got their 'happily ever after' but I not sure if I liked the ending, I was building up with the fight and Bella giving Nellie to Jacob, and it was climatic and then, SURPRISE Alice showes up and the scene ends in less then 3 pages. Sorta anticlimatic to me.   4.) We'll keep this one simple. Jacob imprinting? Morbid perverse wrong complicated?   Now for the Pro's:   Stephenie has such a unique writing style, personally, thoughtout the series I could Feel the emotions and the ties, the people's voices are so distinct and clear that I can hear then. It's like a movie in my head! I think that's why she has such a large broad group of fans. I like this book, but not as much as some. I will always LOVE Edward, and I'm jealous (yes of a fictional character, but who isn't right?) of Bella for having him, it makes me want to go out there and find one right now, Over all, this book deserves more credit then it's getting, once you get past the total shock of the first 4 things I listed. Keep up the good work Steph!

0143038419|4.0|This is a self-autobiography about the author's dissatisfaction with life, which leads to her divorce and one-year travels in the countries of Italy (eat), India (pray), and Indonesia (love).  She laughs, she cries, and she learns.  She makes fun of herself.  She isn't perfect, and perhaps that is what draws the reader in.  The writing in the book is fun and witty and I enjoyed her cunning quips..it can get a little much at times, however, as I feel she overuses her puns and metaphors.  Also, some of her situations and occurances in these countries seem a little \\"too perfect,\\" meaning the stories make great additions to the book, and I was left wondering if the stories were \\"glamorized\\" to make them more interesting for the book.  The people that rated this book low didn't like that the author cried to much, talked about herself to much, was too-self absorbed to see the poverty around her etc.  What these people fail to realize is that the book is NOT about noticing/commenting about third world conditions.  The author is trying to experience self-spritual, emotional and mental renewal during her trip.  The book is an autobiography of her life in these other countries and her SELF JOURNEY!  If you want a political or social commentary about these countries don't read this book.  If you want to read about a fun, (and at times) emotionally unstable woman, who is trying to heal herself and talk to God in the best way she knows how; by going other countries and experiencing life, read this book.  Don't judge or demean the way she is doing it...just enjoy the entertaining ride.

B0015D3Z4O|4.0|\\"Hard Candy\\" comes alive more and more with each listen.  There are so many different sounds on so many of the songs, I can't help but be more and more intrigued each time I hear them.    Despite featuring routine Neptunes' production and clichéd lyrics comparing candy to dancing/sex, \\"Candy Shop\\" is a solid, sparse dance tune; \\"4 Minutes\\" also pulls through in the end thanks to its horn sections, though it too features a setback: at times, Justin Timberlake and Timbaland's busy production practically take over the song from Madonna.    Things really start getting interesting at track 3.  \\"Give It 2 Me\\" is a fantastic celebration of not only dance music, but the Queen of Dance Music as well.  The Neptunes' production builds gloriously throughout, and Madge is more than capably along for the ride.  The same can be said for the next song, \\"Heartbeat.\\"  This song stands out as one of the best on the album; you can practically feel your heart banging along with the Madonna's.  It's another wonderful celebration of a night out at the club.    \\"Miles Away\\" is the best Timbaland/Timberlake production here.  There is such longing in the soundscapes, in Madonna's voice, in lines such as \\"You always love me more, miles away.\\"  This is another standout and one of the more emotional songs on the album.    The same degree of emotion is found in the next two tracks, \\"She's Not Me\\" and \\"Incredible.\\"  The former hits its peak at the end of the song, with a hyper, throbbing beat and Madonna's warped, resounding vocals.  The latter hits its stride at the beginning, with its lighthearted production and bittersweet vocals.  These are challenging tracks for their whole durations, though, with the entire musical direction of the songs changing throughout them.    \\"Beat Goes On\\" and \\"Dance 2Nite\\" are both incredibly fun and retro odes to the freedom found on the dance floor.  \\"Beat\\" features a pretty good rap from Kanye West, and on \\"Dance,\\" Madonna and Justin vocally meet in the middlein a much more satisfying way then they do on \\"4 Minutes.\\"  By hiring the new kings of hip-hop and pop, respectively, it's obvious Madge still has her killer pop instincts intact.    The album's low point is the dull \\"Spanish Lesson.\\"  It's a nice idea in theory to have a Latino-flavored song on one's album, but Pharrell and Madonna don't pull it off in reality.  Its lyrics are pretty much nothing more than a literal Spanish lesson (like, \\"I say something lusty in Spanish,\\" \\"Now I'll translate it for you in English\\").  The best part of the song is the elastic rhythms at the end, and it's telling that there are no lyrics to be found here.    \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You,\\" is moody and clever.  However, it shows obvious influences from Timberlake's/Timbaland's \\"Cry Me a River\\" and \\"What Goes Around...Comes Around.\\"  It's a good song, but originality is lost.    The final track here is \\"Voices.\\"  It is probably the most philosophical song here and would not totally be out of place on her deeper albums like \\"Ray of Light\\" or \\"American Life.\\"  Its tune swirls around you like voices beckoning from all sides, and it includes the provoking question \\"Who is the master, who is the slave?\\"  Madonna's answer to that is found on \\"Hard Candy.\\"  She is a master of dance music, but she is not beneath making herself a slave to it either if her art is made better for it.  Throughout her career, that philosophy has paid of in spades, and \\"Hard Candy\\" is no different.  The beats didn't hit me in the gut as immediately as they did on \\"Confessions on the Dance Floor,\\" and the lyrics didn't hit me in the heart like those on \\"Ray of Light\\" did.  But there are still great rewards to be found here for the patient listener who can give an album, no, a work of art, time to kick off its shoes and groove for them.
031606792X|1.0|While reading final book I find myself cringing at the cartoonish behavior of the characters. Edward is childish and weak during Bella's pregnancy, and Bella is a ridiculous cliche of what a girl will do for love. The werewolves are just pedophiles. I think that Chris Matthews and Dateline should find interesting material around this part of Washington. Meyers writes to insult her readers more than engage them is this novel. Who wants to visualize poor animals being murdered to feed Jacob\\"s and Bella's appetites. Jacob and Leah could have eaten regular food so why do we have to see them hunt.  Bella could have been a character who chooses the mature, smart and liberating path, but Meyers has her choose the gothic fairy tale route to happiness. This is a valid option for the author, but it is not a literary option that makes sense. Bella behaves like a fairy tale character who is under a spell of a wicked witch. She is not in love with Edward, but addicted.  Meyers should have had her free herself from this addiction with Jacob's help, but instead Bella, Edward, baby and Jacob will become a creepy dysfuctional family. UGH  Cringing
B001884P5Y|5.0|These DVD's are very interesting for anybody who likes History at all. I highly recommend them.                                        History Buff
031606792X|2.0|You have vampires, werewolves, and an open field?  Let's all join hands and sing Duck, Duck, Goose!  Did your editor's red pen the violence, the action scenes?  I was looking forward to this book and I hate to agree with so many others, but....
031606792X|5.0|I finished reading this last night and when I was done I went online for the first time and start to read the reviews.  At first I was in agreeing with some of the post, I was confused to what I just spent the past 2 sleepless days reading it didn't fully sink in until this morning...    I really really really loved this book.  I did.  I can see where some of you are coming from with your problems with the book but I think if you sit back and really think and digest what you just read you will agree with me.     This is a book based on fictional characters and a fictional life that was created from a DREAM so of course there are going to be things that don't add up and don't fully make sense, but isn't that the point.  We all wanted to escape to a world that really couldn't ever be b/c we need that escape from reality that why we have an imagination.  If you wanted reality you would never have picked up this series to begin with.    I do agree that the sex scenes were missing their steamy hotness that we all have loved and that the birth scene was a little to much.  I am happy that she is finally over Jacob, but a little creeped out about imprinting on the baby.  And it would have been cool for some more fighting in the final stand off with the Volteri but it does leave it open to possibilities of there being another showdown and book.      This book has such a positive message to it that no matter what happens in life you can always rise above what is thrown at you and have what you want.  There maybe a price to it or maybe there won't but you don't know that all you can do is prepare for what may be and hope for the best.      I think everyone who is writing all of the negative things and how they hated the book should really sit back and think truly about everything you read I think you'll really start to understand everything that was done.  She did give us all what we really wanted in the end; everyone happy and still together.  With the world that we live in now what's wrong with that.    Bravo Stephenie I applaud you!
031606792X|5.0|I began reading this book with great anticipation, waiting anxiously to see if Bella would marry Edward, turn into a vampire, and live happily ever after. For that reason, I was satisfied before even getting half way through the book - Stephenie could have stopped there and I would have been happy! But as I continued to read, wondering what else could she possibly put in this book to make it the perfect ending, the more I was drawn back into the book. It was a perfect mixture of love, romance, sacrafice, pain, manipulation, and anything else you could have wanted. I found myself crying and laughing with the characters, and to be honest, even envying them at times. Life seems boring compared to the lives of the Cullen family!    Sure its unrealistic, but I knew that when I read the first book and its probably what attracted me most to the series. It was a little weird that Jacob imprinted on Bella's daughter, but who can blame Stephenie for adding that into the story? I would have done the same, and besides, who can resist a happy ending where everyone is truly happy? My only complaint with Breaking Dawn and the entire series is that it is over. I'm not sure I'll ever find a book or series that I enjoy reading more than the Twilight Series, and in my opinion, Breaking Dawn was a perfect way to end the series.
B0010ZR160|4.0|My first impression of this film a hour in was that it was a typical Hollywood movie, but it has some very good twists and unexpected surprises. A thought provoking film about morality vs. law, this film does hold your interest. I did figure out a few plot twist before they happened, but it did throw a few curves I missed along the way. Solid performances and story make this a film worth seeing.
B00003CXRM|4.0|I liked the movie. It was entertaining. The movie was delivered quickly and there was not damage.
031606792X|5.0|ok, so I was really shocked that the story took this twist. I would have bet anyone money, in fact, that Bella would NOT have a half vampire child. And like many reviewers here, at first I was a little disturbed. But it pulled through for me. here is a rebuff to a lot of the negative comments I've seen.  1) First of all to those who think Bella is not a strong character or a good role model for girls, let me say this. True feminism is about choice. Bella knows what she wants and she has weighed the consequences. Yes through out the book she has been physically weak (human) mentally and emotionally she's shown more maturity and strength than most heroines.     2) Yes she's pregnant, and heaven forbid she's happy about it? Everyone reacts differently. And by no means does this glorify pregnancy. She spends over a hundred pages near death, with several broken bones and bruises. I'm sorry but that certainly doesn't make me eager for my own bundle of joy.     3) The fact that Jacob imprints on Bella's daughter actually made a lot of sense to me. She was the last part of Bella's humanity left. If he had imprinted on some other girl it would have made it cheap somehow I think.  And Stephenie practically spells it out for us, if nothing supernatural existed, if there were no Edward Bella and Jacob would have been perfect for each other. The part of her that was in love with Jacob lives on in her daughter. Which makes things right in a way I never pictured.     all in all I thought it was phenomenal. it left me dazzled. ^_^
031606792X|5.0|i personally loved it. i mean i also loved the first three books. but once it got past ( spoiler alert) the baby being born, its like wow i can put it down. just because i wanted to know what happend. the relationship between the vampires and werewolves gets put to the test, along with friendships. i would definatly recommend buying this book, expecially if you loved the first three. i also hope that there is more to come...
B0015519VS|5.0|The new Usher CD - Here I Stand, is awesome!!! His music has really evolved,since he became a dad!  I love his lullaby to the baby.  The musical accompaniament, throughout the entire CD, is superb!
B0017R5UAA|5.0|I would probably liken this wonderful debut by Fleet Foxes to Midlake with greater instrumental skills, a better engineering mix and strength in depth, but then most of you probably have not heard of Midlake either (if you like this album, check them out on [[ASIN:B000FVQYJK The Trials of Van Occupanther]]). So perhaps I have to fall back to a mix between  Simon and Garfunkel for the pristine singing, the Byrds and early Jethro Tull for the musicality and the breadth of instrumentation.     Whatever you do, do not expect this album to rock. It is a mix of subtle melodic ballads, such as the lead-off Sun It Rises and the folksy Tiger Mountain Peasant Song and faster more orchestrated songs such as Ragged Wood. It will be interesting whether on their next offering after this impressive debut, the group speeds up or remains etherally slow.
031606792X|5.0|I just finished Breaking Dawn this morning.  Out of curiousity, I checked out many of these review halfway thru the book, and I was geared to be disappointed in the ending...  On the contrary, I found the ending to be delightful.      Being an adult, I was not sure if I could get into this story, but I read the entire series within a 4 week period.  I fell in love with the book and characters..., and truly felt all of the emotions of love, separation, fear, excitement... Every turning page, I was right there with the characters... I could not put any of these books down as they became my life over a very short period of time.  The biggest disappointment was that there is not another book waiting for me to continue the saga...  One can only hope that Stephanie will return with the continuing saga of what to expect next... with Nessie and Jacob, the ferious Volturi..., and Edward and bella.... Stephanie... please continue the story...!
031606792X|4.0|This book was SO much better than I would have expected if I had read the negative reviews before the book.    First of all, this story belongs to Stephanie Meyer's imagination and not that of the readers!  It is truly amazing to see how many fans believe that they know better than the author what should have happened to these characters.  It is clear that so many of the readers became emotionally involved with the characters, and, while some of these fans were disappointed with the direction that this book took, it is presumptuous of them to assume that they know better than the author how this book should have been written.  It is her story to tell, not yours!    Secondly, for all of you who now believe that the story should have ended before or when Bella became a vampire, you would have been much more let down if that were the case.  While there was something disappointing in how quickly Bella adjusted to becoming a vampire, it is clear that the author either had to do this to move the story forward, or else she would have had to have broken the story into two books to give Bella (and the readers) time to adjust.    So many of the readers love Bella  BECAUSE they can relate to her being so normal.  However, everyone had to realize that when she became a vampire all of her awkwardness would disappear and she would become model beautiful.  Without a doubt, many readers wished this for her but were not ready to embrace the new, perfect Bella because she became more difficult to relate to.  In a way the author had written herself into a corner here, because it was impossible to have all of Bella's dreams come true without alienating some of her fans.      Stephanie Meyer wrote the story that SHE believed in, knowing full well that she could not make all of her fans happy.  With that in mind, I think that she stayed true to her own vision and wrote an AMAZING novel.  For all of you who are ripping the author apart online, look at how much joy her books have given youand give \\"Breaking Dawn\\" and Ms. Meyer another chance.  Don't you think she deserves it?
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|Not one of my favorite Madonna albums, but I've been listening to it in my car since its release, over 3 months ago. Like Confessions, it's very energetic and pumps me up before work. Puts me in a positive mood. When I'm about 4 minutes from work, or coming back from lunch and only have a short time left, I play \\"Four Minutes\\". It's silly but fun. My favorites are \\"Heartbeat\\", \\"She's not Me\\", \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\" and \\"Voices\\". I also like \\"Give it 2 Me\\". Not too fond of \\"Spanish Lesson\\" or \\"Candy Shop\\". The rest is ok filler. Other reviewers have noted that Madonna's voice is often lost in these songs, and I agree. I really like her voice, when I can hear it clearly; it's distinctive and pretty strong.<br /><br />The line \\"Dancing makes me feel beautiful\\" in \\"Heartbeat\\" always gets my attention. Madonna is beautiful when she dances. I'm sure she realizes it but maybe a part of her is insecure about it. I didn't care for the \\"see my booty get down\\" part towards the end of \\"Heartbeat\\". The song would be fine without that. I also don't like the \\"get stupid\\" part in \\"Give it 2 Me\\". But it's her new style, so that's that.<br /><br />I've got tickets for her next tour (Nov 20th in Philadelphia!) and I'm thrilled about it. But I hope I'll hear her voice above everything else.
031606792X|5.0|I stumbled upon Twilight a short few years ago. I was struck by the cover. It was bold and simple and I felt that beneath the cover I'd discover an intricate tale. I was intrigued by Meyer's creations. I didn't know what to make of her sparkling vampires or the young boy so seriously crushing on an older girl (the relationship between Jacob and Bella) who was blatantly manipulating him. I was slightly disgusted by Bella. A self-absorbed teen who played into the typical average Jane with a pitiable self-esteem and was incredibly self absorbed but was viewed by all others as \\"special\\" and desirable. Unfortunately, I'd paid a lot for the book so I read it through to the end. Pissed off and appalled by the fact that this book had become a bestseller for young adults, I resolved to disregard any other books written by Stephenie Meyer.<br /><br />Fortunately, in this case at least, I have a very weak resolve so I picked up Eclipse when I should have been studying for an exam. I was pleasantly surprised by Jacob and his indestructible character. He was not ashamed of faults or weaknesses and his love for Bella was bitterly sweet. I still couldn't really stand Bella but Jacob really made me take note of the series. He was shockingly mature in comparison to Edward and Bella who seemed incredibly selfish and incapable of relating to the lives of lowly humans. I really wanted to see what would become of him and hoped that he'd find happiness and peace from the constant struggle his love for Bella placed him in.<br /><br />So it was a big surprise to me that with Breaking Dawn, I actually started to care about what happened to Bella and Edward. There are a lot of twists and turns in this last novel which will probably upset many and intrigue a few. I can't say that I'm ok with everything that happened in this novel as I believe that some parts were way too much for younger readers to handle. But I think it was fantastically put together and the ending was definitely an ending.Not overly sappy and not absolutely depressing (unless the pairing that you wanted didn't happen and you were utterly devastated).<br /><br />There are some themes that are questionable for younger readers depending on how you interpret the material. However, keep in mind that that people have different beliefs about what it means to love and be a family. The concept of choice and lack of choice is brought up on several occasions. As a strong believer in choice, I think that even the instances in which people in the novel seemingly had no choice as to their fate, they truly did. For example, Alice sees possible futures for vampires and humans but not the wolves. It's explained off as the result of the fickle nature of the wolves but are wolves really fickle? They live in controlled packs and the males imprint on their mates to ensure their line.. that doesn't seem very unstructured to me.<br /><br />But whatever. All I wanted to say was that I liked the book. It makes you think, gives a good thrill or two, and it's got a heavy helping of romance. What more could a person want?
031606792X|4.0|For all of the \\"nelly naysayers\\" that thought that this book was a cop-out, unrealisitic, anti-feminist, and providing the wrong message to today's teens, let's all remember that this is FANTASY fiction.    Just like JK Rowling (and I am not making a direct conmparison that SM is the next JK), with the characters developing, changing and getting older, the themes of the novel are more adult than young adult.      We already knew that Bella's path was to marry Edward as of Eclipse, which she did in this book.  THANK GOD. The baby thing - weird, but life throws a curve ball.  She made a choice to keep the baby when her husband wanted to abort it; again, another life choice.  So she gets everything in the end and she does not go to college in this book.  Big deal.  She is immortal and will have plenty of time on her hands to attend Dartmouth.  She and Edward could have deferred admission for a year - we do not know this.    At some point, the story has to end.  I think SM did a great job of sewing up the loose ends and providing a happy ending, which the majority of her fan base was demanding or should I say, hoping for.  I do not see this as a cop-out.  I think SM wove the rest of the story well so we have closure on all of the characters and open storylines, not just Edward and Bella.    If you are looking for SM to provide moral guidance to today's teens, then this is the wrong book for you.  The book is FICTION and not meant to be a guide.  If anything, what SM shows is that Edward and Bella abstained from sex and waited to be married before going all the way.  That should be the most important lesson of all. If you are a Twlight fan, and are interested in seeing how it all ends, then this is for you.      BTW, my fave book out of the four was Eclipse.
0810993139|4.0|My son and I really enjoyed this book. The humor and design of the book were very original!
031606792X|5.0|I'm a bit surprised by so many negative reviews, wow! Had to stop reading them since I loved this book! I'm not sure what I was expecting in this 4th installment but Stephenie pleasantly surprised me! I laughed, cried and enjoyed every moment...thanks for this beautiful love story Stephanie!
B0000048CP|1.0|Like the other 1 star reviews this is just for the fact that this is not the Black Mark \\"666\\" issue.The bonus song is the one minute or so of the low groaning/chant sound that ends other bathory CD's.On the good side the songs match the Table of contents unlike some of the Black Mark Cd's.The cover work for Odin's Wild Hunt is off color and no CD information.The other side of the cover is black.This is a not a bootleg and if you buy a used copy of the Black Mark reissue listed in Amazon make sure it isn't a Kraze Manufactured CD.These review will show up in 3 places just make sure the Cd you are going to order has Black Mark Germany as record label.It will have the lyrics and catalog number BMCC666-4(Black Mark Compact Disc ,fourth release) when you get it.
031606792X|3.0|I was disappointed in the overall interaction between the characters as it wasn't at the same level of angst and passion as the first three books.  Breaking Dawn allowed a nice escape for a weekend, but I will not reread the book and it wasn't the grand finale of Harry Potter Book 7.
0312360266|2.0|I was bored, and annoyed with the main character and all of the drama that they took from real teenage life, and magnified tenfold.    I enjoyed Dracula immensely, and I love the Twilight series, but don't hold your breath for this one. Unless you enjoy choppy writing, and a heroine who should calm down a bit.
031606792X|1.0|Can I just say that I'm not surprised by how bad this book is? I mean, I was expecting some bad character development and horribly written out sentence structure, as usual...And the fact that Meyer decided to throw out an entirely crazy-horrible plot out there made it all the worse. Not only was it the usual cheesiness, tying Meyer with George Lucas for the queen and king of cheesy moment title, it was also just...stupid. I mean, *SPOILER ALERT* Vampires can't get humans pregnant. If that were true, Buffy would be having Spike's and Angel's babies...many times.   Seriously, this book is just ridiculous.
031606792X|3.0|I loved the first book. The second was a good substitute to continue on to the end. The third was a good book, in that it kept me interested because the love story appeared again, and there was real human pain that I could relate to.  SPOILER ALERT.  While reading Breaking Dawn I was not ecstatic when Edward and Bella were married (like I thought I would be, I'm TEAM EDWARD). He is the perfect fake man. The honeymoon was not thrilling, it felt like it dragged on and Bella was truly happy.   I felt like Meyer began to get tired of her characters. I used to really enjoy Alice, and now she was annoying to me. The writing felt tired, and hurried, like she wanted to get this over with and make some money so she could go on to other ventures.  I knew there would be a baby, and I knew it would be a half vampire baby. The gore and violence and anger that came with it, I did not expect. And of course, when the Volturri come, there is NO consequence. All of ti happens to perfectly. I was expecting to be slightly upset in the end, not because she ended it all in a weird way, and with uninteresting plots points, but because everything didn't end so seamlessly. Why tie up all loose ends?    And yes, I agree with a lot of you that Jacob imprinting on a baby that is from the woman he imagined making love to, is very disturbing.  I am glad she ended up with Edward, and she had a baby, and she has them forever. But it could have been less disturbing and much more interesting.   Much like the seventh installment in the Harry Potter franchise where Rowling took harry from Hogwarts all year, the place we were all so used to be the normal setting, this book takes us away from the normal area of Bella's life in Forks, it is more uncomfortable. Perhaps it just can't be as exciting since it's the end.
031606792X|5.0|First off I would just like to say to the true fans of the Twilight Saga this is a amazing novel which is every bit as powerful as the previous three. To those who have been bashing it non-stop since its release quit trying to call yourselves fans and find another series to dump on.    This novel is my favorite in the series and everything tied together so nicely. To those having a problem with Jacob imprinting on Bella's daughter get your minds out of the gutter and quit jumping to horrible and nasty conclusions. If you were true fans you would have noticed that Quil also imprinted on a child and that their relationship is nothing sexual. It eventually would turn to that when the child reaches the age of the werewolf. I mean come on Jacob is just like a big brother to \\"Nessie\\" and there is nothing wrong with having a big brother.    To all those who have said that Bella and Edwards romance is not such a big part in this book it is. I mean the story does center around them. The story could not be completely all lovey dovey the entire time just because they got what they wanted. Stephenie Meyer was trying to make the relationship as real as possible. They have problems they have to worry about.    Then there is the Bella's daughter thing that everyone keeps freaking out about. Its was a nice inclusion into the story line and after the Character became more dominate I warmed up to her very well. Everyone on all the message boards are going on and on about how vampire's cannot have children and all that bull, but come on it is a fiction novel. Plus when it was stated that \\"Vampires could never have children\\" the key word being vampires it never said anything about a Vampire and a Human. This makes perfect sense since Bella and Edward are one of a kind. They have a relationship it is a loving relationship not a predator and prey thing.    So all in all this was a excellent way to end the series.  The story flowed well together and gave new insight into certain characters. For all those Jacob haters out there (I was one of them) the section of the book that is narrated by him gives new insight to his character and made me beging to like Jacob for the first time since the series began.    Stephenie Meyer did a excellent job finishing her beautiful series and offering two unforgettable lovers that I think will go down in history as two famous fictional lovers. To those hating this book, make up your own ending and quit putting down the author...I don't see any of you writing bestselling novels.     I would recommend this book to any and evryone who enjoys a good story that  is powerful and emotional. It is a perfct way to end a beloved series. READ THIS BOOK!!! Quit listening to all the haters who went in reading the book just trying to find its flaws.
031606792X|1.0|After reading the book for straight 7 hours, I realized that, out of the 750+ pages I read, I only liked the first few chapters and the last page....which altogether made up about 1/7 of the book.  It left me extremely disappointed and wondering why I stayed up to read it.    This book felt completely foreign to me and nothing like any of the other books.  Everyone seemed out of character and the central themes present in the other 3 books just werent there.    I didnt have any expectations but I realized that this book could of been amazing if Meyer hadnt tried to be so far out there in her writing.    She also broke the rules of her own universe.....like with the whole ****SPOILER**** vampires cant reproduce but somehow Edward knocks up Bella?? Yeah maybe theres a loophole there but when Bella got prego it went downhill and the focus was taken off of the dynamics of Bella and Edwards relationship.    Theres a whole other list of things that I despised about the book but they are outlined pretty well in other customer reviews.  I am not a hardcore fan but I really feel for the fans that waited so long for this book.  I think the longtime Twilight fans deserved a better ending to the saga they followed for so long.    I'll always love Twilight, for it was the book that drew me in and made me fall in love with the whole universe.    But as for Breaking Dawn...I'll be returning it, Dont waste your money
031606792X|4.0|Breaking Dawn tied everything into a neat bow, and while I was expecting a little more out of it, I am thoroughly satisfied by the final installment of the Twilight series.    SPOILERS***    I really, really, really enjoyed seeing Edward and Bella together as vampires and Edward not having to \\"hold back\\" all the time.  It was cute how she had to refrain from hurting him!    My only gripe w/the pregnancy plot was that the story draged a bit.  But, I was so happy for Edward to be a father!  I can totally relate to Bella being protective, and willing to die for her baby, from day 1.  I think (me being a mother) that had Bella reacted any differently than she did, THAT would have seemed artificial.      The big showdown at the end was a bit of a let down, too.  I kind of wanted to see Edward and Co. kick some butt...  Why not do the fairy tale thing completely and have the Cullens become the new vampire royalty?  Then in addition to everything else Bella got (beauty, grace, baby, Edward...) she could be a princess, too :)
B000002KFJ|5.0|This is Sabbath's best ever! Every song is perfection upon perfection! So many people who doubted Sabbath at the time must look back with wide eyed astonishment and be ashamed of themselve's for ever doubting the power of this album. This is not only the best Sabbath album but contain's two of their best offering's ever. Megalomania and The Writ are metal song's without being over the top or extreme. These song's are dark and angry without even trying. These song's are like a tank sludging through a swamp filled with mine's. If you consider yourself even a half way fan of Sabbath or metal at all you will have to buy this album. This album is wrought with dark emotion and every song bleed's a black promise. I have been a fan of all the Ozzy era albums most of my life. Sabotage cemented it's history with me and millions of other fans. If you only own Paranoid make time to find out what this band was all about and buy this album. Even to this very day I have yet to find any rock,metal or thrash album to even come close to how poweful it is !
B000XVT7SW|4.0|Just received the new DVD release ... and while I was thrilled with Vicker's portrayal there were a lot of things that bothered me about this production.   Yes, far too many and too close facial shots and the lip synch leaves much to be desired because the vocal exertion on film never quite matches the vocal expression in the music.  Nevertheless, I recommend this simply for Vickers and Von Karajan ... although I was not duly impressed with the surround sound balance.     In all, it is a MUST for the serious collector ...  but perhaps a more modern recording would carry more effective musicality.   I have the Domingo recording ..  nice also, but again it lacks the immediacy of a live performance well executed.
B00003CXC6|3.0|Let me start off by saying I love Kurosawa and have seen many of his films, but this one was a little slow and felt too simple and shallow.  I got the point of what he was trying to say almost immediately (truth is relative and depends on the person and that everyone's version of a story is told to make him or her look best), and didn't need to go through every character's perspective to get that point.  It felt like he painfully belabored the point and not much else was added to make the plot interesting.  And in some places the acting was overdone for the plot/genre and was actually a little bit distracting to me.  I'm not saying that I disliked the movie, I just didn't think it was that it could qualify as a masterpiece.
031606792X|1.0|I cannot believe I even have to give this book a star! That implies worth of some kind. I literally threw the book away part way through it. Ugh!  Poorly written drivel!
031606792X|1.0|Its hard to see young girls and some of my friends going crazy over this book series, especially one that does not empower its female lead character. I feel like this book warns against having sex at all in a way, while at the same time saying that all you need is a man to be happy.     *SPOILER ALERT*     Comparing this to the ending of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer series, one finds Buffy alone, with friends, but not saddled with a boyfriend, or really a burden anymore. Buffy showed young woman that you didn't need a man to be happy and in fact, sometimes they will be jerks and it'll make you a better person in the long run. Bella's need for Edward all the time was trying in the last books and its tiring now. The series went on way to long, and this pregnancy twist was undoubtably one of the worst I've read in literature ever.     If you want better horror, check out Richie Tankersley Cusick's newest work Walk of the Spirits  [[ASIN:0142410500 Walk of the Spirits]] as this amazing woman not only wrote novelizations to the original Buffy movie and pilot episode, but she understands the character dynamic needed for a fantastic novel.

How did this get past what had   to be dozens of beta-readers, editors, friends and family?  Did they all just lie to her that it was GOOD?    Wow.  Gonna be a b*tch to get her career past this one.
031606792X|1.0|Twilight was awesome, New Moon was a 2/10 and Eclipse was a 6/10.  Breaking dawn. Not on the scale.
B00005JOA0|5.0|I really enjoyed this one.  It kept me guessing and held me to the end.  I look forward to seeing it again.  True to the English countryside and culture of the period, it is worth viewing many times.
0143038419|5.0|I loved this book!  She writes in a style that is profound and makes you think, all the while being like you are just talking to your best girlfriend!  This book made me laugh out loud several times!  She writes things in just the most perfect, yet conversational way.  It was very interesting to learn about both her journey in life and through the foreign countries I will never be able to visit.  I thought her insights were amazing, and her year off was very well spent.  I can't wait for her next book!
031606792X|2.0|This book does not have the same feel as the previous books in the series. SM has taken this above and beyond what the Twilight series should be about. It's too intense and in-your-face in all the WRONG places.    THE PROS:  - I really did appreciate the fact that Bella was finally turned into a vampire. I feel that that was the right decision.  - We really got to see Jacob's point of view. And I thoroughly enjoyed his book. It gave insight into how Jacob's mind works and it made him easier to understand now.    ....but the warm fuzzy feelings stop there.    THE CONS:  - The lack of ever questioning whether or not Edward was able to impregnant Bella to begin with. There was no forewarning about what would happen when the two would have sex. The entire family knew they would, they were getting married...it's a given it would come down to it, so why not do a little research beforehand and find out if it's actually a possibility. And if it is, bring that box of condoms with you on the honeymoon! It's too basic for SM to overlook. She did not address it for a reason.  - She just used Bella getting pregnant and having Nessie as a means to an end. 1) The most obvious reason, for Jacob to imprint on...which is just plain idiotic, since Jacob is to just drop all his hope and feelings for Bella and transfer that onto HER DAUGHTER instead?? Then Bella can be w/ Edward guilt-free and call it a win-win? That's ridiculous and really disturbing. And then 2), the less obvious reason for Nessie to exist in this story..is to create some drama over, be a catalyst to provoke the Volturi into causing havok. Nessie is really just an excuse to get the story moving. But it definitely was unnecessary and moved it into the wrong direction.  - SM has this fascination with impending deaths, someone/something coming after Bella and the Cullens, and constant need for every single character to make a self-sacrifice. Have we not had enough of that same exact bit in the past 3 books? It's been done time and time again, let it rest. It has been so worked over I wonder if that's the only way SM knows how to make a plot \\"exciting\\".  - SM focuses way too much on the action/Volturi in this book. Suddenly the entire issue w/ the Volturi is fleshed out into 100+ pages of preparation/worry for an attack...yet, when it comes right down to it nothing really happens. No throwdown, it's all pretense. It's a climax with no resolve!   - Instead of focusing on trying to create \\"exciting\\" action sequences and supernatural gory occurrences, she should have focused on the dynamic of Bella & Edward's relationship...the ways in which it could now be taken to NEW HEIGHTS since they are no longer limited by Bella's human drawbacks. Since they are now both vampires.  - SM lost the magic of what made Twilight so unique and a romance that was other worldly.  This book got way too mature, way too fast and took on too much of science fiction twist. It wasn't about the characters anymore.  - There's a huge disconnect from how Bella & Edward were in the past 3 books, to this book. There's no rhyme or reason--Bella should not be comfortable w/ becoming pregnant, she should have been terrified! Edward should have been more compassionate w/ the fact that she is pregnant instead of gunning for the \\"thing\\" to die. Once Nessie was born, Edward never took on a fatherly role...which is really quite shocking. The characterization is just completely out of whack in this book.   - Ending this series should have been geared towards the growth of Bella and Edwards as a couple now that they are both vampires and now that they are new parents. SM completely DID NOT address that and glazed over it, by making Bella completely skip over the whole newborn vampire phase. And instead it became about their impending deaths via the Volturi.  - And lastly, for some reason, I am very disappointed that the book did not end with a last scene of Bella and Edward together in the meadow...where it all started.    There was indeed a happy ending, everything worked out. But there were too many f**ked up things that happened along the way, overcasting a shadow on  the happy ending. It was not magical, there was no sense of awe. Instead, it leaves a bitter taste to the end of this series. What a way to go out...
031606792X|5.0|Stephenie Meyer in her own words said that she knew she couldn't make everyone happy, but that SHE was happy with this book. She has said all along that she writes for herself and is pleasantly surprised when other people enjoy it as well. I think that should kept in mind while reading this book.    (I am going to try not to spoil anything for anyone, so I apologize if some of this sounds vague!)    As others have mentioned, this book does change some from the previous books. Yes, there is not as much internal dialog from Bella, but really, after seeing things thru her eyes for 3 other books, do we really need to hear the same thoughts again and again? We would then be reading a book that would be over 1000 pages, not nearly 750. I think that it was smart on SM's part to realize that her readers understand who Bella is and not replay every thought she has. (In all fairness, I felt that some areas could have been a little more specific, but I don't want to spoil this book for anyone by mentioning specifics.)    I also enjoyed that we get to see things through Jacob's eyes for a while. Don't get me wrong, at first I was really freaked out when she switched to that view, but as mentioned before, was it really necessary to hear Bella talk about all the reasons why she was doing what she was doing? By the end of his perspective, I realized the necessity for that point-of-view, which is also why New Moon went the way it did (the first time I read New Moon, I didn't understand why Edward left and Jacob saved the day, but by the second time through, I realized why that book, and what had transpired, was necessary).     Please keep also keep in mind that this a fanatsy (almost sci-fi) book. SM has mentioned over and over that she doesn't have \\"messages\\" in her books. For those that are really trying to put some there, then you are doing the book a great disservice. For those that feel this book may be a little mature for the YA group, well, it is. SM herself said that she thought about putting an age warning on the book, but her publishers didn't do it.  What can really be expected when the main character is making adult decisions? She has already made it perfectly clear in the other books that Bella is a more mature 18 yr old than most. How else could she be ready to become a vampire (as she decided to do at the end of Eclipse)?    All in all, this book made me laugh, made me cry and everything in between. There were plenty of twists and turns, which is a pretty typical SM theme. Some people have said the ending is anticlimactic, but when ending an entire series, there is a need to wrap things up, but this story's ending was not overly done. And, yes, I will go there-this is a much better final book than Harry Potter's final! I still have questions, but if every small question is answered, where is one's imagination?    While reading, try not to rush it and skip ahead. If you take your time, you will realize why things are written as they were. Just enjoy getting into a fantasy world and take a break from your every day life!
0345495004|1.0|I did not like this book very much. It was very slow,depressing, and I hated the way they just left their children. So they could have a love affair. I would not recommend this book.
B00156ZWV0|5.0|This is indeed a very good opportunity to have a detailed view at this composer's work at a bargain price. To me, it has always been difficult to get Vaughan Williams's recordings as I'm out of the UK, where most of them are released individually. It is great to have a box like this to get closer to this marvellous orchestrator, with his compositions so full of instrumental colour. The price is excellent, the only disappointment is that thera are no booklet notes at all. At least the CD tracking details are ok.
031606792X|1.0|I'd only echo all the things that have been stated before by others, but it was one giant deux ex machina.
031606792X|5.0|I'm not sure why some reviewers are reacting so negatively. This book doesn't go against the others in the series at all. It's a mythical ending to an already mythical series.    I know there are several people who have issues with \\"Breaking Dawn,\\" but the story is very good if you're willing to really read it, put it in context of the other books, and not let the comments, of those who read the spoilers that got out early and perhaps judged them out of context, poison your view.     SMeyer specifically asked that people not take the book out of context. It needed to be read beginning to end to understand the whys and wherefores of the overall series plot.     Some people took whatever snippets they could find and blew them way out of proportion, ruining the book for a few others who apparently are weak minded enough to let others' views convince them the book is awful before even reading it. Way to go by the way. Way to be independent thinkers.     SMeyer has said that she had a complete story arc for this series. \\"Breaking Dawn\\" is the ending to that arc which she skeletally outlined when she wrote \\"Forever Dawn,\\" for what, if I remember correctly, was a birthday present.     She's telling her story in its entirety. That's the key part right there. It's her story. It amazes me that some readers honestly think that just because they read an author's books that that gives them the right to dictate the story's continuation and to feel some kind of personal insult when they don't get their desired result.     I'm happy with anything SMeyer wants to give us because I love her writing style and her characters (yes, it's not classic literature, but it is very good entertainment and classic in it's own way, a modern way). She's shared five wonderful, fantastical novels with us, but there will always be people who aren't satisfied. Any \\"Breaking Dawn\\" she published would probably never live up to a lot of peoples' expectations simply because some people are just never happy with anything. To these people it could always have been better.    After reading \\"Breaking Dawn\\" I would recommend going to Stephenie's website ([...]) and reading her FAQ for the novel. I think it will answer alot of questions people have about where she was coming from when she wrote it and understand the story better.    Bella as a young parent:     Where I went to university (Northwestern Texas in case you care) I knew several, several women who were married and/or had children. Some married at 18 or 19 and often had their first child before they graduated. Key word: they did graduate (on time I might add). It is completely doable. And no I wasn't one of them; I just witnessed it over and over again. SMeyer is not saying that the be all end all of existence is getting married and having a baby and not going to college.     She's telling the story of one young woman growing, becoming an adult, and finding happiness when she honestly believed her whole life she was completely boring and average. She doesn't realize how extraordinary she really is. Isn't that the message we want to give our daughters? You are exceptional. You can have happiness (whatever that is: career, love, family....all of it. Bella has hers, but yours is whatever you want it to be.) however you want it if you go out and find it.  Apparently there are several people out there who equate Bella with a simpering valley girl who can't juggle a complex life.     It's never said that Bella and Edward won't go to college; they have eternity. They will go, but they have to take care of this crisis first (the plot remember?) How boring would the plot have been if it was just Edward and Bella get married, Edward changes her, and they go mess around at college for a few chapters? There'd be no conflict with the Volturi because the Cullens have complied with their wishes. There'd be no plot.    That makes for a very boring story, and yet it's exactly what some of her readers wanted I guess. I get a feeling (and maybe I'm wrong) that many readers seem to think this story is the O.C. or Gossip Girl. It's the story of a seventeen-year-old girl who falls in love with a VAMPIRE for crying out loud! A gigantic suspension of belief is a prerequisite to pick the first book up at all. That's why it's a fantasy. For some unknown reason some people now (I guess because the books have been out a few years and her fans are comfortable in her universe) believe that vampires and werewolves really exist in our world and damnit Edward should have used a condom. This isn't an Afterschool Special; it's romantic fiction.    I saw some reviews that the book is sending the wrong message to teenage girls about love and life. That this will encourage a girl to look for a boy to take care of her and having a baby will solve all her problems. Really? You mean there are hundreds of teenage girls out there right now reading this book and thinking: Now I just need to get my vampire boyfriend to knock me up and everything will be perfect.     Right. Any teenage girl who would let this series influence or make a decision like that for her would also probably let any other book, a movie, her friends, her boyfriend, her manicurist, her pet hamster....etc. make the same decision for her too. If she can't distinguish real life from fiction than she's got bigger problems; it's called psychosis and it requires a shrink not YA author.    At some point people are going to have to take responsibility for their actions. \\"The book made me do it\\" excuse is not only silly, it's laughable.    I also saw some comments that Bella would freak out if she felt something move inside her and was too calm when she realized she was pregnant. Well, we all know that Bella doesn't have what many would call normal reactions to anything. She does the opposite; it's part of what we all love about her (and part of what drives us crazy about her, too. Because she's not perfect.).     She really comes into her own in this book. She's funny and charming and just plain likable as our wonderful heroine.    She shows real growth and maturity in this book, much better than in the last couple of books where she's displayed, with aplomb, her ability to be the whiniest, most undeserving narrator in existence at times.    Here, however, she demonstrates a primitive and ancient strength: she bonds with her child and will do anything to save her life.    Is Stephenie saying this is the best course of action for everyone? Is this some kind of thinly veiled political statement? Of course not. Please, please remember that this is a work of fiction and romantic fiction at that. I seriously doubt Stephenie is perpetuating some hidden agenda.     A child who no one even thought was a possibility is actually a vividly unique and clever plot twist. But ultimately that's all she is, a fictional character in a fictional world.    I know SMeyer said vampires in her universe can't have children. That's right; they can't. She didn't say anything about humans and vampires having children. She was purposefully vague, like any good writer when she has future plot points that she doesn't want to give away.     And that brings us to Nessie:    Her name is a bit off putting (though by the end of the book I was used to reading and pronoucing Renesemee in my head). I might have nicknamed her May instead of Nessie, but I understand SMeyer's \\"sea monster\\" running joke through the story. And she is a very likable character (no small feat when children in any entertainment medium can sometimes easily become incredibly annoying).    Ok, Jacob: I know some people are thinking \\"ugh\\" to this, but it does makes sense.    Jacob went on and on in Eclipse that Edward was unhealthy for Bella. I actually thought after reading \\"Eclipse\\" that the unhealthy obsession was between Jacob and Bella. Jacob was quite scary at times in Eclipse. He was like the drunk frat boy standing by the keg waiting to put ruffies into Bella's drink. Thatkind of scary. And selfish to a fault. I found it irritating that Bella and Edward both thought they were selfish for wanting to be together (when they really weren't), and yet it was Jacob trying to force his will on everyone like some psycho ex-boyfriend from a slasher movie. \\"Breaking Dawn\\" explains why he was so crazy.    I'm not a Jacob hater. I *love* Jacob. Even when he's sometimes making an a** out of himself. He was wonderful in \\"Twilight\\" and up until he phased for the first time in \\"New Moon.\\" I believe his affections were just mislayed and this explains it. He found his connection in Bella though he didn't realize it was with her future not her present. He figured out where his affections truly belonged, and he and Bella can have the relationship they're meant to have.     I'm sure some people have a problem with this book (or the whole series) as it deals with fate and soul mates. That it's too convenient that Jacob imprints, and it happens to be Bella's daughter. As I've said before it makes sense. I guess some would have been happier if Jacob was miserable for the rest of his life because of misplaced love.     Why do people bash a happy ending? Did you really expect a tragedy? There's no closure for these characters in that. The books are all about true love and soul mates. If you have a problem with that concept (which absolutely permeated the first three books) then why are you still reading the series?    Speaking of soul mates. Why do you assume that soul mate must have a romantic connotation to it? There are other forms of soul mate. Imprinting touches on it in fact.     Jacob and Quil will be whatever their imprints need them to be: whether it's a brother, a friend or a lover. I recommend a book called \\"Threads\\" by Nell Gavin [[ASIN:074140916X Threads: The Reincarnation of Anne Boleyn]] for a real, true definition of a soul mate. Bella says that Edward is her true love, and Jacob is her soul mate; why couldn't that need be as a brother or a son rather than a lover?    I will repeat: This story is a fantasy. Whether you believe that the concept of \\"one person meant for one other person\\" existing in our world or not doesn't matter. It definitely exists in the Twilight universe. Making plot elements and foreshadowing fit together into an intricate puzzle is part of good storytelling, and SMeyer does this very thoroughly and entertainingly.     Also, I don't think Bella and Edward are weak for not being able to live without each other. There are loves that are so profound that two people are irrevocably changed by it.     It's not about Bella not being independent enough or Edward being overprotective. Real love, marriage, and partnership is about supporting each other. It's not weakness to truly need someone else (or several someones including children, parents, siblings, friends etc.), to feel that deep connection and know he/she is part (notice I said part not all) of what makes life worth getting up in the mornings. The world is a harsh place; a familial support system works wonders. I think subconsciously that's why the Volturi feel so threatened by the Cullens.    Bella and Edward need each other, but they also need their family like we all do. That's why I think they fell apart when they were separated in \\"New Moon.\\" Bella said it: She lost her true love (not some crush) and a large chunk of her family. How would you react if you lost the love of your life and your family all in one day?    Nessie's impact on Bella/Edward's relationship:    Edward tells Bella at the beginning to the book that he wishes he could have a child with her. It shows their growth and maturity as a couple to love their daughter and they do what good parents do: they protect her and are ready to sacrifice themselves for her to live.    On a final note:    I will share one part of \\"Breaking Dawn\\" I was less than thrilled with. Rosalie. She was doing so well. She had moved from being a shallow secondary character in \\"Twilight\\" toa sympathetic voice in \\"Eclipse\\" as we delved a little deeper into her past and her thought processes. Her regressive actions seemed just a bit too psychotic and totally self-serving. I guess despite my hopes for more character growth her mind can just never get past the infantile Id stage.    Futhermore, she can b*tch all she wants about her desire to be human again, but I don't believe for one second that if she got her wish she wouldn't be screaming for perfection and immortality after finding the first wrinkle or seeing the first pregnancy stretch mark. Her vanity is too ingrained in who she is despite her inane belief that her mind is deeper than the shallow pool Edward once referred to her as. I've always felt Rosalie is a \\"grass is always greener\\" kind of girl who needs to be run over with the lawn mower.    My hope is that people might just take a step back from the story, give themselves a chance to digest the unique twists the story took (I mean it is alot to take in; give it some time), come back to it, and reread it and enjoy it.    So, my advice is to sit back and enjoy the *whole* series for what it is, a delightful, very sensual (without being explicit) and fantastic fairytale with a wonderful and satisfying climax.    This book wraps up the series nicely and still leaves room for beaucoups of fun in the future if SMeyer decides to continue. I can't wait to see what else there is in this universe when and if she writes more.
031606792X|4.0|I am distressed to read all of the negative, insulting things that have been written about this book and its author in these reviews.  It reminds me a lot of the mean things said about J.K. Rowling and Harry Potter 7 when it was released. There is absolutely nothing wrong with writing a critique about things one does not like about a book, but I think it can and should be done with a little more grace and a lot less venom (pardon the pun!).  As was the case with Harry Potter, the people who love the Twilight books have grown to love the characters, and they certainly have hopes and expectations for the way the series should end, but it's ultimately the author's decision to end it the way she sees fit. She invented the characters and it is her story.  You can talk about what disappointed you and what you wish she would have done differently, but there is no need for the high level of acrimony floating around.  Stephenie Meyer is an artist with her own vision; she has no obligation to anyone.    That being said, I enjoyed the book BECAUSE of its unexpected surprises, not in spite of them.  For instance, I never expected to read a large portion of the story through Jacob's perspective, but it ended up being a riveting way to tell the middle of the story.  And I thought Jacob's imprinting the baby was a GREAT plot twist!  When he walks away from Bella and thinks she has died, he HATES this newborn creature so much that he feels murderous...then looks into her little face and, through a force outside of his control, is forever changed.  Sure, it's a little creepy, but it's NOT something Jacob has chosen, and it ends up being a touching way for Jacob to become part of the family.         There is lots more to love about this book.  It's compelling reading with both humor and pathos.  It's cleverly-written. And one theme that runs throughout the series is such a beautiful one--true love is putting another's happiness ahead of one's own.      Thank you, Stephenie Meyer fora delightful book.                                                                                                                                                            `
031606792X|5.0|Hello, little girls, this book is all about wish fulfillment for for mothers who used to be little girls who loved Anne Rice.  (I know, b/c I'm one of them.)  And it's damned good.  If you are a teen and hated it, you're just too immature to get it!    You see, everyone thinks they want to be a vampire, but most vampires are dead and don't have sex or kids or eat food, don't love humans except to eat them or transform them into similarly dull creatures, and things are depressing and bad in their lives.  But Meyer has brought us the ultimate in fantasy wish fulfillment - a vampire who loves \\"me\\" utterly and completely, but who also can walk about during the day and live a normal life full of school and family, and will make \\"me\\" a vampire, too, someday!    And for those of us who are adults with kids of our own, we know that sacrificing having our own children would be too big a price to pay, even for all the cool things being a vampire entails.  So she *had* to have a baby.  And if you are happily married and find yourself pregnant, even if it is the wrong time or place, you will probably instantly love the baby kicking inside you, too.  Remember Meyer's conservative home state and family structure?  Of course her narrator would be eager to marry and have children at a young age.    These books never were about bad outcomes.  Everything always worked out in the other books, and you aren't very bright if you thought that there would ever be a less-than-perfect resolution to the Jacob/Edward dilemma.  These books aren't meant to teach or illuminate anything ethical or deep.  Just enjoy the fun of a perfect fantasy!
031606792X|5.0|I have to admit I was very nervous when I began reading Breaking Dawn. Contrary to most people's opinions I did not like the way the series was heading. Twilight was (obviously) a fantastic and well written book. New Moon was ok, for me it was Jacob's sarcastically funny and light hearted character that kept it going, and Eclipse was bearable. Stephenie Meyer was gearing away from everything I loved about Twilight - the mystery, the unnattainable love. Everything was becomming so mushy and lovey-dovey. So when I broke open my shiny new edition of BD, I was reasonably nervous that it was going to be dripping with sappy, unrequited love.     Was I ever proven wrong. The book was capitivating from the beginning, drawing me in and not allowing me to set it down for a second. The problem with Eclipse was that it had been too boring. Nothing had happened. BD was entirely different. Sure, it might have been a bit predictable. But at least it kept me entertained - not once did I feel the urge to yawn.    I loved that SM made the book more mature. There was the gruesome birth and the 'sex' scenes between Edward and Bella. It wasn't an X-rated romance novel, but it wasn't a coy childrens book either. What made this book different from J.K. Rowling's final book was she didn't feel the need to SHOCK her readers by killing off everyone's favorite characters. SM shocked us in her own way, and it didn't leave me with that empty feeling of a needless death.     Personally, I loved this book. This is close behind Twilight as my favorite in the series. I am tired of all the bashing reviews. One of my favorite things about this book is that SM broke the mold, pushed herself, and delivered a completed work that was different from what anyone expected. Twilight fans need to give her a break, think outside the box. Not everything always happens in the way that you expect, which is half the fun of reading - being amazed at what the author has decided to do with her characters. Honestly, Ithink Stephenie Meyer ended Bella and Edward's story wonderfully.    Oh, and for the record, I actually liked that Jacob imprinted on Renesmee (even though I wasn't so fond of her name...). I am a huge Jacob fan and I am glad he got the ending he deserved. I also loved the part of book that was written from his point of view. It had me smiling and laughing the entire time.     In conclusion, I ask for Twilight fans to not think so critically of BD. It is a well-written work that Stephenie Meyer poured her heart and soul into. She introduced us to the world of Bella and Edward flawlessly and she ended it with the same grace. I have never been so impressed with the final installment of a series I love whole-heartedly.
031606792X|2.0|I just wanted to start by saying I just picked up these books last week and finished all three before actually going to a Midnight release party and standing in line to receive my anxiously awaited fourth book of the series and by saying this I am not a fanatic fan just someone who enjoys a good story.  I just picked up Twilight and thought is was a great page turner.  New Moon also managed to hold my attention.  Eclipse was not as good as the first two books but I still was excited to read the fourth book. Well all that I can say is after thinking over this book for the better part of all day today I am sad to say that yes I was dissapointed. It felt as if the author was reaching...just to make everything work.  Things just felt hurried to try and make everyone come out with a happy ending and fell short compared to the wonderful plotlines and character realizations of the first two books. I have thought about this over and over and again I thought this was just an o.k. book.  I felt the author took some things to the extreme and those of you that have read the book know which scenes I am thinking of.  Now I don't know if I will see the movie.  I still think S.M. is a great author but Breaking Dawn was just so far from the original idea/concept setup in the first book to really understand and relate to.  In a way I have to agree with other reviews I have read in that it did not even feel almost as if this book was by the same author that wrote the first two books.  This book was just o.k. for me.
160285033X|5.0|This novel is is superior to The Kite Runner.  The suffering, sacrifice, and nobility of the two women in this novel make for both satisfying and thought-provoking reading. Both as a study of character and as a study of culture, it is superb.
031606792X|5.0|I know what a lot of people are thinking.  They think that this book is promoting young people getting pregnant.  Has anyone paid any attention to the fact that Bella is MARRIED and she waited until she was married before becoming pregnant?  Before, everyone was saying how great an example this book series was and now, just because she gets pregnant after she's happily married, everyone is saying this book is a bad influence.    Also, a lot of fans don't like this book because it wasn't what they expected.  Yes, I was disappointed that it mostly revolved around the baby, but I started to like it a lot more towards the end.  I think a lot of fans are mad that part of it was from Jacob's perspective and considering that there are a lot of Jacob haters out there, that made the book less appealing as the others.    Stephenie Meyer was just trying to make it appealing to everyone.  She was trying to make Jacob's fans happy as well as Edward's.  I think the book was really good, despite some of the odd turning points.    I know many people are disappointed (seeing as this book only has 3 stars)with how it finished, but if they would just look at it from a different view, try to see things from all sides of the playing field, then maybe people might start to like the book a bit more.    I'm sorry if I have offended anyone by my review, but I hope you enjoy Breaking Dawn, because I know I did.
031606792X|4.0|Most of these reviews are way too emotional.  What do people expect???  It's a story about vampires and werewolves.  No reality people, the sky is the limit!!??  Most are mad about the message it may send about getting everything you want and being too happy, when my biggest concern was that teenagers are reading it.  There is a lot of implied sexuality, adult situations, etc.   I thought the content was more adult oriented and that young kids won't even get it.  Of course there would be adult content and adult situations though, right?  They are married and living adult lives now.  What other choices did they have??  Are we forgetting Edward is over 100 years old.  There were a few parts that were so way over the top and parts that were so obvious to me that the characters were oblivious too, and that was a little irritating. And yes, the name Renesme bothered me to no end, but overall, I liked how she does address all of the loose ends and puts a nice big bow on the top!!  It's a fun book, especially Jacob's part, and people should only read it for entertainment purposes, not for the deep hidden messages.  It made me happy.
031606792X|3.0|I personally felt the book was too unrelatable to like. In twilight, I felt like I was really bella so much that when reading the first three books, It was like I was the one with edward. Thats why alot of people like it for one of the main reasons because we all want a boyfriend like edward and that true love that reading this almost makes it feel like your in that reality and that it could actually be possiable. Breaking dawn didnt feel like that reality as much because bella didnt feel the same as before and when she was almost killing herself for the baby you just wanted to hit her.     We all wanted bella to become a vampire. If I were in her situation I would want that too. But when she finally became one it felt a little unreal because we had all been reading her a human like in thr real world so we can relate that when she changed I felt like she was a differant person even though she had the same personality. I was so used to reading about her in school and with friends and a daily life of somewhat normalness that breaking dawn didnt have which I disliked.    I thought reading jacobs part was gonna suck. All I wanted to read was about bella and edward . But his part wasnt that bad  that I actually kind of liked it. I thought the whole breaking of the pack and sam hard push to attack felt like reading fanfiction. It didnt seem real because it was was out of the norm to be reading leah seth and jacob having one mind. It also felt too convenient at some parts like how jacob and sam became two alphas so now they could read each other better. And I also never felt like it was jacobs calling to become a leader when it started saying that.    I also felt like it was also taking away from the story when she took away bellas chevy. I know it was old and would die eventually but it just felt like she took out smething too familar in the book but truthfully i forgot all about the truck into the story.     Also one of the main reasons of the story that we got used to was how edward would have to restrain hiimself so he would not kill her accidentally. The honeymoon part and how he gave in to easily just didnt feel like something edward would do since he loved bella too much to give in. At first he wouldnt but then when she begged him to do it over a dream she had of him actually having sex with her it didnt feel like that is something bella would do either. Truthfully the honeymoon was nice in the beginning and it felt relatbale that she would be nervous about being naked in front of him but when they started arguing and that werid maid thing with the pregnat blow at the end it kind of let ya down.    The book was nice overall and a truely inventive and twist turning ending. But I just felt ending the book unsatisfied.The story always seemed to have a nice balance of normalness and supernatural that we all liked. This just seemed to much supernatural that it felt like not the story we all fell in love with.I think stephenie took out to many loved componets of the story that it made me let down and it felt unfamilar that it felt like it was just a branch of an off story of it and not the real ending.
031606792X|5.0|Warning: Spoilers and ranting ahead.    I finished reading this book today, and thought it was brilliant! In the time waiting for the release of Breaking Dawn, I decided I only wanted three things: Bella to become a vampire, Bella and Edward to have their happy ending, and for Jacob to imprint. Stephenie Meyer did not disappoint any of these, which ultimately made me happy in the end. It is an understatement to say I was shocked and upset when I saw some of the reviews for this book, which again, I loved and thought was brilliant.    That's not to say I didn't have my doubts. After reading the first section, I had to put the book down for a second to ponder my thoughts. Bella pregnant? It couldn't happen. It wasn't POSSIBLE. It went against everything that we've learned in the previous books. It made me angry: Bella could NOT have a baby.     My view didn't change until Jacob imprinted. Honestly, why does everyone think that that is so bad? Just because she's a baby? If you have a problem with that, go back a book and read about Quil and Claire, as Jacob explains to Bella how there's nothing sexual about it, and he will be whatever the little girl needs him to be at her current age. Obviously, the same explaination applies to Jacob.     Honestly, I probably would never have accepted Renesmee if Jacob hadn't imprinted on her. And who cares if it's Bella's child? I understand that he used to love Bella, and he'll always be her best friend, but I can't imagine Jacob with anyone else but Renesmee. Bella was never Jacob's. They could never be together. If Jacob/Bella were meant to be, he would have imprinted on her, but he didn't. Because he belongs with Renesmee.    Which brings me to my next point: The name. Renesmee. Why is everyone complaining about that? I agree, it's not the easiest, but in the book it was shown how to pronounce it. And I'd take Renesmee over Nessie any day. Bella's refusal to use the nickname (until the very end) was what kept me sane throughout the second half.    More things that people are complaining about: Bella getting married, not going to college. Have you not read Eclipse? These two things were not a surprise at all, and were made very clear throughout the third installment. I hadn't heard any complaints until now.    And for those of you who are angry over the pregnancy thing. Stephenie is NOT trying to encourage teen prenancy. Anyone who assumes that that is the case is obviously just posting bad things because they stayed up too late trying to finish reading the book.     Still, many of you think the book ended with a \\"neat bow\\". Some people say that Bella got everything, that she didn't suffer or give up enough.  ...  HELLO? Bella has been suffering the entire series. For a while, she lost Edward, and she suffered over giving up Jacob. Long before Breaking Dawn, Bella made the decision to become a vampire for her true love, giving up her family and friends. She didn't plan to have a baby, or have Charlie find out about it. She didn't expect any of that. She was willing to leave her family behind forever. So why should fans be angry that she got a little more than she'd originally thought possible? There's no way anyone can say that Bella hasn't suffered enough.     Plus, it's the end of the series. Neat bow? Of course all the conflicts are going to be solved. No loose ends but be left untied, otherwise we'd all be unsatisfied.     Okay, my last rant for the complainers =). The ending was unrealistic? *scoff* You're reading a story about VAMPIRES, remember?    Personally, I loved Breaking Dawn. I sat for over 9 hours straight, unable to tear myself away. Stephenie, once again, filled the story with love and hope, even during the darker spots. I can't wait to start over and re-read the entire series, from Twilight to Dawn. =)    Way to go, Stephenie! I LOVE THE TWILIGHT SERIES!
031606792X|5.0|Thats my biggest complaint. I know its a young adult novel, but after the bed scene in eclipse(you know what I am talking about ;-)), I was expecting a bit more of that part of the story.    Other than that, I think that this is the story that had to be!!! No other way was ever possible.     During Jacobs book I was a bit skeptical... but by the last page. I knew. We all should have know. That no matter what led up to Breaking Dawn. That the special connection was more that true love it was life altering not just their own, the whole community. (Think matrix, except no one had to die)    I just loved it. It was closure. I am fully satisfied that I got to know everything that I needed to know. I hope she continues the story line. She created monsters, but not nessie, US the readers!! We want more, we need more.    Good Job Stephenie!!!!
031606792X|4.0|Ok, so I have just finished reading the book a little more than an hour ago.  All I can really say was that it was interesting. It really wasn't what I expected, but that didn't make it a bad book or story. There were parts that I was aggravated by (trying to pronounce that baby's name), and there were parts where I felt truly happy and sucked into the story. I think this book is only what you make of it, and even though it is so different than Stephenie Meyer's previous books, it still is a good story none the less.     One thing that I was thinking about throughout reading this book is that it really isn't meant for the 12-16 year olds like the other three books were.  I felt torn in between reading an adult novel with mature themes (but never getting into specifics) and a young adult novel which had a glazed over \\"happy\\" gloss applied generously.It felt like the author was being held back by the YA category  and it could of been a lot better if she was given the adult category freedom.     Overall, I still recommend Breaking Dawn and it is very surprising to say the least. Just remember that it is Stephine Meyers story to tell, and she can have any ending she wants. She doesn't, and cant make every fan happy.
031606792X|5.0|I'm not going to spoil anything but i thought this book was a very satisfying end to this saga. i got so crazy at times i wanted to scream and the names were a bit much but in the end i think it was great. i don't think I've ever been more fulfilled by a book ending.
031606792X|2.0|I had looked forward to the final story in this series. However, Breaking Dawn seems to have taken a huge left turn toward an overdone scifi plot device. The fourth book feels barely connected with the previous three books at all. Bella is largely unrecognizable as the character we knew before. Edward is diminished almost to a secondary character. Issues and themes from the first three books are dropped or simply solved with the introduction of new backstory. Everyone in the book gets everything they want and the reader is left unsatisfied.<br /><br />If you've read the previous books of the series, the desire to see them to conclusion will be very strong. However, you may find yourself very disappointed and wishing you had stopped at Eclipse.
076790592X|5.0|Some people may say this book is just the same old stuff \\"re-written\\". But even if that is true we  need to be reminded of these life lessons. To many times in our lives we forget what is really important. Morrie reminds us about everything we all forget at one point or another in our lives. Read this book if you want to be reminded of what really matters in our lives.
B0013L2EDQ|3.0|Although I found this book enjoyable overall, it was a struggle to read at times.  As a James Rollins & Sigma Force fan, I was a little disappointed because there were several times I felt stalled and disinterested.  Although this is not one of my personal favorites, I will still recommend this book to my friends because Rollins is a good author whose work should be enjoyed.
031606792X|1.0|I can only ask \\"Where was her editor?\\".  Any doubts about Bella being MarySue, are now dispelled. I could go on, but why? It's just plain sad.  Ugh.  This has to be a case of too much too fast.  I really wished I had stopped at book 3. I would have more respect for Meyer.    If you read this book, you may find yourself demanding those hours of your life back.  Go see the X-files movie, its just as bad and only 90 minutes.
031606792X|4.0|There were a couple of times reading through this book that I laughed out loud because it seemed a little silly - like Bella having a baby. I wasn't expecting that and it seemed far fetched. But then I thought, hey, this is fiction, so I went with it. I thought that the entire pregancy dragged on longer than it should and I also thought that the name she picked for the baby was ridiculous. Other than those things, I have to say that I tore through this book in the same way I read the others - it was highly entertaining. Some parts that were especially interesting were the descriptions of Bella turning into a vampire. I liked reading about that experience. So, I think it's definitely worth reading and how can you not read the end of the saga after you've read the first 3? Enjoy it!
031606792X|1.0|Characters lacked in substance.  The story is straight from the Anne Rice Mayfair Witch books (an excellent series).  It seemed like a different voice, not Stephanie's flowed through the words and reversal of personality traits regarding the main characters.  I am a fan of the first three and her more recent work The Host (amazing).  The change in content regarding sex was uncalled for as is evident in the wonderful writing in the first three.  It should have ended as a trilogy, making you want for more...like Scarlett and Rhett.
031606792X|1.0|Happily I never spent any money on this series, I checked them out from a library.  As horrific as the other books were, this one is the crown jewel of awful.  There is not one single redeeming thing in this book.  Not one.
031606792X|1.0|Basically, a huge dissapointment of a finale book. The characters were way off, the story felt flat, there was way more romance in the previous books, the plot was just there to fill paper. I hated it, and my idea of the series ends with Eclipse. It was even comical it was so way out there, even considering the fact that it IS about vampires and werewolves. I keep seeing this as a South Park spoof or really bad D movie.     ---Over a month later and still not interested to re-read............    I had waited in anticipation for so long wanting an epic 4th book to wrap this series up. What an epic let down! Not only did i feel like the characterization wasn't there, the story is so boring yet far fetched that i had to struggle to get through this book. Many of the great moments we were waiting for were quickly passed by and transparently written. I had such a feeling of sad finality when it was over, it could have been a great end to the series.    When i read the first 3 books, I would re-read almost immediatley and then start the series again, re-read etc.....I was always wanting more and felt enveloped by the characters stories and interactions.    When I read this book, I kept thinking WTF?  Are U Fkg Kidding Me? all the way through.      After i was finished, the book went on the shelf, and I have had no desire like the previous 3 to re-read it. It's just a book now.  For me the series ends at Eclipse.
B0018O4YSQ|3.0|Acting and Plot arn't that great, neither are special affects. I'm not saying it's not worth watching but it isn't worth buying.
031606792X|5.0|Remember this is fiction, not real life!!! If you have never been pregnant then you will never know the feelings of responsablity you feel for your child. To me Bella's transformation when she found out she was pregnant would be that of any Mom! She went from being selfish, including her being able to resists others into her brain, to thinking of others. She learned to think of protecting others. Instead of self preservation, giving her life for others. I say, \\"WOW\\".   In the end, true to Stephenie's religion, they get to live together as a family forever!  I can't wait to read it again!
031606792X|1.0|I am a true twilight fan who has read the first three books more times than I would care to admit.  But this was just terrible!  For me, it boils down to the fact that not a single character acted as they should.  Even all the crazy plot developments, I would have been able to handle, but where was the love?     I think maybe Stephenie didn't realize what it was we all loved about the first books- the Edward/Bella romance.  Pages and Pages where nothing happened except Bella forgetting to breathe.  It was all missing from this book.  I feel cheated!    I think Smeyer lost the plot with this one.  I will forever pretend that eclipse was the end.
031606792X|1.0|*Spoilers*    When I started reading this series, I knew Stephenie Meyer was not a good writer from the get go. However, I stuck with her because she showed great potential with her ideas. With each book, I expected her to get better and for her writing to develop. Sadly, this was not the case, and she basically had an epic failure with this book. It barely had any coherence, full of typos (her editor should be fired), poor character development, and for christ sakes, SHE went against her own canon. Renesme? You got to be kidding me. The imprinting was a copout. Bella was the \\"perfect\\" vampire. Riiiight Meyer. Dont be fooled by the tweens flooding the reviews with fives...this book is complete utter BS.
031606792X|5.0|I don't have the time to write a full thorough review but I must just say one thing: the book was amazing.  WITH THE EXCEPTION: I wish SM would have built more on Edward's character. I feel he was left behind in the story and he was not the central part of the theme in the story. He was just there. I also wish she had developed and let us seen further what kind of relationship he has with his daughter Nessie. The relationship btw father and daughter seemed distance.  But, I guess we will have to wait till Midnight Sun to find out much more about that. Otherwise, I think the book was amazing. I think people need to take a step back and think about the whole saga and understand what SM wanted.
B000Q6GUTI|2.0|It's a little bit Clint Eastwood, a little bit MacGuyver, a little bit Rambo, and a whole lotta BS. It's Bob Lee Swagger, played with gritty resolve by Mark Wahlberg. From the angry scowl to the pained grimace, he's got all the dramatic bases covered. It is impossible to understand about 75% of his dialogue because he speaks in a very rapid mumble, but since we have seen these scenarios in a thousand other movies, we really don't need to hear him clearly, to understand what's going on. Space does not permit me to detail all the ridiculously implausible situations and impossible exploits in this high-octane action flick. Wahlberg is a patriotic super-soldier with almost supernatural abilities, who gets double crossed by his government. When he gets set up as a patsy by a team of shadow-government assassins, salvation comes in the form of his fallen buddy's girlfriend, a doe-eyed young beauty played by Ms. Mara. He has been shot to pieces, but sends her to Walgreens with a list of 12 common household items, which she then uses to sew him back together and nurse him back to health, although she is not a nurse but just a humble third grade teacher (who happens to live in a home that no twenty-something third-grade teacher in the South could ever afford, but be that as it may....)    Swagger is then primed and ready to seek revenge against the villains who betrayed him, including one played by Danny Glover. (We know that Mr. Glover is playing a bad guy because his voice is hoarse and raspy and he never smiles), and an evil senator played by Ned Beatty (we know that Mr. Beatty is a bad senator because he is old and white). This is when the MacGuyver-like devices are constructed with common items hurriedly purchased at the hardware store. It is not clear how the expensive items are paid for, or why the hardware store would have high explosives and high-tech in-the-ear two-way communications devices, but be that as it may.... we then have more helicopters, more heads beingblown off, a tape-recorded confession, a secret meeting or two, an arm or two being shot off, etc. Need I elaborate further?    If you are a 14 year old male and thirsty for some blood and explosions, check it out. Otherwise, you might want to pass, because you may find it very hard to suspend your disbelief for a solid two hours. The film critic from the L.A. Times owes me some money, because it was on his recommendation that I let two hours of my life get shot down in flames like an evil black helicopter by Jimmy Lee Swaggart, er uh I mean Bob Lee Swagger. Praise the lord and pass the ammo, America.
B0016MJ6HY|1.0|I rented this from Blockbuster and should have taken heed to my instinct to put it back on the shelf when I read the sticker proclaiming it to be a Blockbuster exclusive rental.      I was lured in by the cast and the art house feel.  Ten minuted into the film, however, I found myself wondering:  \\"is this it???\\".  I kept waiting for it to begin but it never did.  Jude Law and Natalie Portman were really the only interesting characters in the movie and their bits were so minute compared to the entirely lackluster Nora Jones that I kept wondering to myself if the rest of the cast would add this film to their shame list and forget they ever participated in this disaster.        As for the arthouse feel, think in terms of the cinemagraphic tricks used in music videos and video snapshots of subways in New York where everything seems purposely sped up and blurred for effect.  Now imagine an entire film of that.  It's exhausting.      As to be expected with such a gifted lead, though, there was some lovely music to keep me company throughout the numbing dialogue and impersonal directing.  Other than that, it's painful.
031606792X|1.0|i was so excited i pre-ordered this item when it was first made availble and have been waiting ever since, as soon as it came saturday i ripped it open and dug in. the wedding and first few chapters were great and then, then it happened bella pregnant!!! wtf! ms. meyer swore that this would never happen and it was just a popular fanfiction topic, and thats what the rest of the book read like a fanfiction. it is all just to hard to swallow, that this piece of trash is the end to such a great story, and they are gonna make a movie of this!! i didn't like the host, but hey i thought maybe body-snatchers are not my cup of tea but now that i have read this i know steph's fan has taken away from her writing. it is hard to live up to the hype, but she could have done way better than this, i wish i could get a refund for poor story!! it doesn't even read like her other books!! i feel like i am still waiting for this book, like i am waiting for the real end!!
B0017I1FNK|5.0|Emmylou Harris may be so good, she is at her penultimate for most of her career.  I admit, I enjoy her soulful voice and spare orchestrations so much that I really cannot claim to have a favorite CD from her releases.<br /><br />This 2008 release was produced by her former husband,  Bruce Ahern.  You'll hear old friends on this CD, including Dolly Parton (backup on \\"Gold\\") and Buddy Miller.  The 'songfinder' has snagged some great music, too, from the likes of Tracy Chapman and Kate McGarrigle.<br /><br />\\"Broken Man's Lament\\" talks about not messing with someone else's dreams. When the subject married a bar singer, he asked her not to sing.<br /><br />\\"Gold\\" talks about the human failings in all of us:<br /><br />\\"no matter how bright I glitter, baby, I can never be gold\\"<br /><br />Probably my favorite song of this collection is \\"All that you have is your soul\\" by Tracy Chapman.  This song contains some of the best life advice you can get.<br /><br />In this case, I think a lot of this CD was gold as soon as it was released.<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, August 2008
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|There is not much more I can add to the discussion of this product.  \\"Viva La Vida\\" isn't the Coldplay that dominated airplay with their last release.  \\"Viva La Vida\\" is deeper, darker and more emotive. So far, the title song and \\"Violet Hill\\" are the two leaders from this collection.

031606792X|1.0|Final tally:<br /><br />  * 14 Flinches<br />  * 9 Winces<br />  * 8 Cringes<br /><br />When I started reading Breaking Dawn (the final book in the bestselling young adult vampire series) I started counting the number of times author Stephanie Meyer overused these three words to describe her characters' actions. It felt like a fun way to track the author's weakness for this particular imagery. Everybody flinches constantly. There's so much wincing! Ooh, cringe cringe!<br /><br />By the time I was done with Breaking Dawn, the tally had become a brief, exact book review.<br /><br />I almost gave up on the book early on -- the whole pro-life teen pregnancy (It's a necessity; not a choice!) felt grossly out of place. But Meyer is nothing if not compelling -- something about the way she writes has forced me to keep reading.<br /><br />But I think the spell is broken after reading The Host and now the whole Twilight series. I'm done flinching at her terrible-but-compelling writing. I'm done wincing at her creepy relationships (Meyerville: where the men are borderline abusive, and the women love to take it). I'm done cringing from the downright squickish age differences (infant girl & 16 year old boy = wtf?).<br /><br />No more flinching, wincing, or cringing for me. Stephanie Meyer, I'm quitting you.<br /><br />(And yes, I'm aware that this threat has little value having now read all her books. But it's gotta stop somewhere)
031606792X|5.0|I Loved it!!! In some ways it wasnt at all what I had expected, and in other ways it was...Although, in the end I would have to say it was far better then i EVER imagined it could be. AMAZING!  Good read, I couldn't put it down. :) I love Stephanie Meyer's Books...I can't wait for the next one.
031606792X|5.0|First off, I'm aware that these books are not the most brilliantly written, planned, precise and intellectual books ever created. They are somewhat of a guilty pleasure to me, a 16 year old girl. That's just the point - they are a pleasure, very enjoyable and very entertaining. Any book that leaves me happy/excited/wanting to read more is fine with me and deserves five stars.   It was just the same with Breaking Dawn, the fourth book in an immensely enjoyable, (sometimes cringeful, if read aloud in front of family) epic series.   I'm not saying that some of the reviewers bashing the book do not have a point, as opinions are of course unique to everyone. However, some of the things that have been pointed out are not incorrect, but unnecessary. Clearly you have to suspend disbelief with a book about vampires and werewolves. So now I'll go through the book and say which points were valid and which I disagree with.    ***SPOILERS AHEAD, OF COURSE***      So Edward and Bella had a child, half vampire, half human. Did I think that Stephenie Meyer was copping out, trying to grasp desperately at loopholes to give Edward and Bella a lovely little happy conclusion. Yes, she probably was. Who cares??? This book is, at the end of the day, fiction and fantasy. I found this storyline surprising but thought it was a nice twist. Stephenie had deliberately never mentioned that male vampires couldn't concieve with humans. She's the author, she sets the rule, she says it's possible, so there we have it. I was happy with it. It gave the book momentum and room to grow.   I knew that the book could not simply exist to tie up loose ends and be a little Edward/Bella lovefest. It had to have a catalyst to change events and shake the plotline up a little, and 'Nessie' certainly achieved that. I admit, I found the name cheesie and fanfictionesque, but this is the Twilight series. I read the books with this in mind. It's always been fanfictionesque. That's what makes it so great.         I didn't feel that Renesmee took anything away from Edward and Bella's relationship. I thought it was beautiful, and didn't feel a lack of romantic moments between them at all. Until I read that on a review, it didn't even cross my mind. Breaking Dawn was filled with emotional and loving moments between them, both subtle and unsubtle *cough biting pillows cough*.    Jacob Imprinting on Nessie. Hmmm. In some ways, I did feel that it made the love between Bella and Jacob from Eclipse slightly downplayed. Did they only have a connection because he was destined for her daughter? No. I don't think so. I must say, I didn't understand why Bella lost her feelings for Jacob when she became a vampire. Was is because he imprinted? I hope so, otherwise it would mean that she lost those feelings because she was no longer human, but her love for him was part of Bella's character.  I thought it was a nice resolution to Jacob's character. Yes, it's like a fairytale. What's wrong with fairytales? Everyone lives happily every after.    I absolutely LOVED Bella becoming a vampire. The scene where Edward changes her was rather emotional in my opinion. Even as Jacob believed her to be dead and gave up, Edward perservered, and stayed by her side throughout the whole transition. I loved Book 3 so much, as it was everything I'd been hoping for. After the good but depressing Book 2 following Bella's weird pregnancy, it was nice to have some really happy Cullen family moments and jokes. I felt that Bella retained her character, despite the narration changing slightly (as was to be expected). I was so glad that her feelings for Edward remained unchanged if not stronger and vice versa. I also liked the fact that Bella was strong enought to overcome the bloodlust she felt.    This shows that Bella was a strong person. This reminds me - to all those who claim Bella has no individual interests that make up her personality - she has a great love of classic literature. So there.    I'm a 16 year old girl, and I can separate fiction from reality (though I wish fiction was reality haha). I cant see many young girls reading this book and saying 'oh golly, I think I should go and get married and pregnant at 18 because Bella does in Eclipse!!' Books dont always have to set an example or have a role model. They're books. Besides, is there really anything wrong with having a child with the man you love? Is that a bad message? NO. I would say not. The books probably do hold lots of themes - anti abortion for one, no pre-marital sex. I'm sure I could spy more if I took the time. However, I really don't feel the need to. I don't read these books to dissect and find themes and motifs. I read them to enjoy them, and I'm sure that's probably a common feeling.    I was surprised at reviewers noting that characters were behaving differently. I didn't notice an obvious change in the slightest. If there was one, I assumed it only transpired from the events in the book. As different events unfolded that the reader had never experienced before within the novels, clearly we havent seen the characters reactions to them yet. They are, after all, the author's creations. Surely she knows best how the characters are meant to act. They come from her imagination.    My only annoyances were that Jasper was called Jazz, which was just no...noo...for me. I felt an abscence of Alice and Jasper moments, and the battle at the end probably did end with too little casualties.  I'm just nitpicking though. I loved the book. It kept me turning the pages, it was funny, cheesey and great for holiday reading.  Don't overthink it, suspend disbelief and just enjoy it.   5 stars for entertainment value.   It ended with a big bow just as the author promised. I for one, am not adverse to a happy ending. I was so happy that all of my favourite characters were alive and ecstatic and living a dream life. It was AWESOME. I really hope the criticism, that is slightly vicious that I have read, doesn't stop Stephenie Meyer from writing the fifth and sixth books she was thinking of. I for one cannot wait.   A fantastic continuation. Stephenie Meyer, you ROCK.
6304779356|5.0|I've loved this movie since I was a teenager, and watching it again as an adult, it is still a great movie!
031606792X|1.0|I was a fan of the first three books but really felt that SM dropped the ball on this one. The only thing I was expecting from this book was to wrap up a good story. I hoped that things would end nicely for Jacob but other than that I was up for whatever Stephanie Meyer had planned. Or so I thought....  I know that this book is for a young adult audience so I was not expecting graphic sex scenes. That being said there was nothing!  I felt there was almost no connection between Bella and Edward at all. When done correctly even the most PG scene can be romantic,  fulfilling and just plain perfect. It's too bad SM didn't do it correctly for Breaking Dawn.   I have had issues with Bella since book 2, but this one put me over the edge. She is such a Mary Sue. I didn't like the explanations about her powers and how she was able to skip the newborn phase of being a vampire. It would have been interesting to see her trying to battle out her feelings for her baby and interacting with Jacob while trying to suppress the urge to eat them at the same time.   The one part of the book I did enjoy was book 2 Jacob. I didn't think I'd like it but it ended up being the best part of the book for me. Of course I hated the end where Jacob imprints on Nessie. Really? On a half vampire infant? I was actually rooting for Jacob/Leah. I felt that their relationship grew and changed and I was rooting for them to get together.   I didn't feel Bella's connection to Nessie at all. She spent all this time fighting for her \\"baby\\" that was killing her and then she was all \\"Aww a baby. Well, let's get frisky with Edward.\\" When she finally \\"connected\\" with Nessie I just didn't believe it.   I'm sure the hard core fans will love this book and defend it too the death, but for anyone on the fence about the series it's just not worth it.
031606792X|3.0|I haven't even begun to read the comments yet about the book.  I see where the other ratings are so I know I'm not the only one who a little disappointed.  The writing itself was good, but it was the story that needed some work.  It didn't fit the characters from the previous books.  It was like a whole different story, only the names were the same.  That's the only way to describe it. (spoilers below)      Now I'm a mother so I can understand a little about that need to have and protect what's inside you.  It can be quite overwhelming.  Even if it's the last thing you want, as soon as you know your pregnant it's all of the sudden the only thing you want.  But I'm 26 years old.  Much older then the target audience of this book.  I can't imagine being a 15 or 16 year old trying to comprehend this.  Especially since we are not really in Bella's head during the most part of it.  And to use Rose like that was selfish!  She knew that Rose wouldn't be able to say no.    I actually enjoyed the last half of the book.  After going through all the stuff in the beginning, it was actually a relief to find some familiar personalities again.  In fact, I felt the first half was like a two star and the second half was like a four star so I was able to settle with the three star rating.  Maybe when I get around to re-reading it I'll feel differently.  Now that I know where the story is going re-reading all books will be interesting, to say the least.
0756404746|5.0|All I can say is \\"wow!\\"    Although I am a very avid reader, this is my first fantasy novel and I picked it up due to the rave reviews and its \\"best of the year\\" designation. This is now one of my favorite books, due to the characters, plot, and Rothfuss's incredible ability to transport me to a different time and place without overdoing the imagery.     I am enthralled by this book and can barely put it down. It breaks my heart that the book will soon end and I will have to wait until April to read what happens next!    Needless to say, this book has opened my eyes to a new genre of fiction, which I will pursue with fervor (however, I am worried no other fantasy novel will compare). As for those of you who don't ordinarily read fantasy, give this book a chance! You won't be disappointed.
031606792X|1.0|Wow. I've tolerated Stephenie Meyer's poor writing for the first three books because the storyline was captivating. Vampires, shape shifters, forbidden love and sacrifice. It was everything a vampire book should be.     So what the hell went wrong with Breaking Dawn? (spoilers, big time!!!)      It was utter garbage. From the flashback in the beginning of the book, when Bella is thinking about Charlie's reaction to the engagement and then ... we get the actual scene! How convenient, I thought to myself. Little did I know, this was the first of many, almost innumerable, random occurrences that happen to work out in Mrs. Cullen's favor.     Everything is so happy and disgustingly easy for Bella that I wanted to throw up.     Newborn vampires have always been wild and uncontrollable. Not Bella! She is in perfect control, from the first minute.    Jacob has lingering feelings for the woman of his dreams, Bella. No problem! Bella gets pregnant (which was never explained) and her perfect and super talented baby happens to be Jake's soul mate, so not only does he get an unspoiled-by-vampire-venom version of Bella, he gets to be part of the family.     Bella can never reveal herself to Charlie, and so must fake her death or never contact him again. Wrong! Jake tells Charlie that there are more things in heaven and earth, Mr. Swan, than are dreamt of in your philosophy, and Charlie suddenly knows that Bella is alive but different and that's okay with him as long as he gets to see Nessie and Bells whenever he wants. Plus, he gets a woman, the quickly grieving Mrs. Clearwater.     The Volturi have all of the most powerful and terrifying vampires on their side, and they want some of the Cullens to add to their collection. No worries! Bella is able to save absolutely everyone with her lame shield that can do anything she wills it to do. Yay Bella!    Then Bella and Edward and Little Nessie go to their fairytale cottage and live happily ever after, the end.    COME ON! The wholeNessie thing was creepy and wrong and Bella gets whatever she wants without having to make any sacrifices. She doesn't even miss human things at all, since she's sooooo good at being a vampire. She could've been a little clumsy or still a bad driver, anything to make her more endearing than the perfect and unrealistic version of Bella. I couldn't identify with Bella at all, nor did I want to. Vampire Bella was too perfect and too happy.     Bad writing, bad story, and a bloated 750 pages made this possibly the worst ending to a series I've ever encountered. But at least there is one thing to be thankful for, that this is indeed the end and we won't have to waste any more time or money on this crap.
0810945797|5.0|Combining the talents of Jim Henson's storytelling with Brian Froud's exquisite art, [[ASIN:B000R8YC1I The Dark Crystal]] is an amazing film. The World of the Dark Crystal is a must-have companion piece to the film. On its pages are inscribed in detail the epic story's conceptualization and the process of designing its beautifully imagined characters and creatures. The book contains rare artwork by the ingenious fantasy artist Brian Froud who designed the complex and immense world of the Dark Crystal, a world whose people feel culturally authentic and utterly believable, a world where the landscapes feel familiar and yet completely alien at the same time. It is this fabricated universe, this artificial sense of reality that makes the Dark Crystal such an enduring classic.    Never before had movie audiences been transported to an entirely new world, a world without any human contact, a world divided by two opposing principals, a world that was so fragile and yet so savage. In The Dark Crystal, we see the evolution of imagination and a physical, tangible representation of duality. We see the importance of balancing logic and faith, science and spirituality, self-preservation and sacrifice. The triadic images found in Brian Froud's artwork express the importance of social, spiritual, and psychological equilibrium. This is a spiritual philosophy shared by many cultures and religions including Druidism, Buddhism and even in Christianity. This is also reflected in the design of the characters and the sets that at times resemble, in physical appearance as well as in architectural design, those of different ethnicities but both Froud and Henson avoid racial profiling. Instead they've created a rich and majestic vision of a world that never existed and still it is so believable that we feel as if we are seeing the documentation of a recently discovered alien culture.    Along with Froud's artwork, the book includes informative descriptions of the characters, creatures, andflora and fauna of this fantastical world. There is also a new introduction by Froud and a facsimile booklet featuring original concept drawings that were used as a tool in marketing the film to studios. In conclusion, The World of the Dark Crystal is a wonderful addition to any fantasy fan's collection, an inspirational look into the mind of an artist, and an essential collector's item for all those who love the film.

031606792X|5.0|I loved it!  Stephenie Meyers is an amazing story teller.  She had me guessing and then shocked... and I've never been happier to be wrong.
0131103628|5.0|I've read the first edition, and this is a must.  It doesn't cover some of the details of ISO/ansi 99, but those can be found elsewhere.  What can't be found is the way the authors drag even the beginning student right into the depths of memory allocation so soon.  This book isn't too easy, but it's one no student of c can be without, and it's well-written, into the bargain.
0321525655|3.0|This book is very good on the philosophy behind \\"designing\\" presentations. On how to use visuals and how to make your presentation into an engaging story. Unfortunately the book focuses too much on visuals and on (a bit superficial) presentation and design philosophy. Also the author contradicts himself with the last chapters in the book which are completely unneccessary. While in the first half of the book he argues convincingly for less is more. A bit more facts and figures or bulletpoints might help this book. But maybe those are in the handout? I recommend this book for those who are first time presenters or when looking for new twists. But it might be a bit lightweight for people who have to give \\"deep\\" presentations.
031606792X|3.0|Wow, what a wait we had for this last book and wow, such a let down in my opinion. While I am thrilled to have Edward and Bella and the gang back in my literary life, I really had hoped this book would be of the same caliber as the first 3 in the series. I am disappointed that Meyer seems to have taken a clichéd and easy way out to end this complex and amazing love story. Without giving any plot twists away, let me just say this is indeed the weakest of the books and I'm glad it was the last one to read or else I might have lost interest earlier. I had expected more anguish and emotion as the plot progressed and it felt to me that an easier story line was taken instead. I also felt the pacing in this book was very slow, especially in \\"book 2.\\" It felt like it needed a lot of editing down to keep the story moving forward without losing the reader. All that being said, I'm glad we all now have the closure we needed and I am SO excited to see how the movie Twilight turns out (I hope it doesn't become only about the James series of events as that really was only the last part of the book) and I'm thrilled that Meyer has decided to write Midnight Sun (Twilight from Edward's perspective). She posted a sample first chapter and I loved it!
B000WGWQG8|4.0|There are seven parts in the DVD HBO miniseries. We watched them in seven nights. We didn't want to skip a night.<br /><br />It's all good, but the earlier episodes are better than the later ones. Why? I felt too much was skipped during the last few parts. Too many gaps. Naturally some events would have to be left out or the series would be 40 hours. Yet, it would have been better for them to narrow the focus on his earlier career.<br /><br />In the final three parts it was hard to get a feel for the scope of what was going on in the country -- it became more of a personal story. And even in that context, it was hard to get a sense of all the big national events that were affecting John and Abigail personally, outside of family affairs. During John's presidency, I don't recall seeing any Congressional sessions, speeches, or proper cabinet meetings. If there were, they are minor.<br /><br />Did the series capture John's and Abigail's character? As much as I know from my limited reading, yes, probably fairly well. I was surprised by the magisterial manner of Jefferson as portrayed here. His overwhelming sense of calm and thoughtful genius was appealing. I haven't read in detail enough about Jefferson to say if that was accurate. He had a great passion for art, collecting books, and of course architecture. But that passion does not seem to be evident in this portrayal. He's almost disturbingly Mr. Spock-like in emotional restraint.<br /><br />The intrigues and battles between Jefferson as Vice-President when Adams succeeded Washington as President are given relatively small notice, as is the Sedition Act. Adams did start a navy and avoided entaglement with a European war. Most of the events of his single term are seen from the dreary setting of a still-under-construction White House in Washington, D.C.<br /><br />Picky points:<br /><br />Many famous quotes of the founding fathers are included in this series, not always in the context of which they actually uttered them.<br /><br />The artificial aging makeup or lack of it, and the inconsistency of it, was a bit disconcerting. Sometimes John looked older in one scene, then younger in the next. This was handled poorly, and I don't know why, given today's state of the art. Neither John nor Abigail appear to age naturally. The bad dental work, pus, vomit, bloodlettings and barbaric surgery of the 18th century are represented with some realism, though, for what that's worth, plus the excessive facial makeup the French nobles (including men) used. Marcel Marceau would have fit right in.<br /><br />In spite of these caveats, the miniseries is compelling. It's no substitute for David McCullough's book, though. Additionally, I'm not sure about replay value. I was enthusiastic about it while I was watching it, but now I wonder if I will want to see it twice., and the inconsistency of it, was a bit disconcerting.

B0018CWEYY|2.0|Amazon states that the list price is $59.99.  That is the same as previous \\"Lost\\" seasons, which contained 24 episodes each.  So why should \\"Lost - Season 4\\" cost $59.99 for only 14 episodes?  Rip-off.  \\"Season 4\\" was excellent and proved \\"Lost\\" still had some legs, but what's the point in ripping off loyal Lost viewers?  No wonder there was a writer's strike last year.  Not only does Hollywood rip off its writers/creators, but it also rips off its viewers/customers.  Let's hear it for the writers who fought back the bloated Hollywood monster.
031606792X|3.0|So, I eagerly awaited the new Twilight series book, Breaking Dawn, as did most everyone, I assume. I waited a good day to see what the general assumption was that people said, and while I normally take their opinions with huge mountains of salt, I decided to go ahead and flip through them. While there were some reviews that were most obviously written by twelve year olds who have decided to dedicate their lives to texting and spelling things horribly wrong while telling me that Breaking Dawn was, like, the best thing like ever, I stumbled upon some people who looked like they had at least a bit of a brain and told me, and the rest of the internet that Breaking Dawn was a massive piece of crap, and that they probably shouldn't have spent their twenty three dollars on the book.     Despite my own problems getting the book (I bought a copy that had thirty pages missing and I realized I skipped right past the reception to right after the sex, which made me really confused until I realized that I was a huge dullard who didn't look at the pages), I found this one to be...rather disappointing. It wasn't a large steaming pile of poo, as others have said, but it definitely wasn't up to her standards, and the book stayed longer than I really wanted it to, dragging on and on until I just got bored, put down the book, and cruised youtube for a while. That made me quite depressed - with the other books, I couldn't put it down, I was utterly immersed in it. This book I had problems gathering enough interest to get to the next chapter, let alone the end of the book.    Here's where it gets a bit spoilery, and those of you who haven't read the book should read no further if you wish to keep it a surprise.    They get married; fine.  They have sex; also okay.  They have a vampire baby.  ....    This was a bad idea in Angel, and time has not sweetened it. The fact that the baby was killing my least favorite character was all well and good, but the fact that we still had to hear her speak made me want to take an ice pick to my eyes. At first I thought that having it in Jacob's point of view would be awful, but then I realized that having this particular portion of the book be in Bella's perspective would be like unfiltered poison running through my bloodstream.    Being a hardcore Bella/Edward fan, I found her consistent need to have him there with Edward being tortured as all hell over her dying rather irritating, as I always have, and possibly could be the one thing that I despise most about this book - other than the fact that she's having some sort of super-baby. It didn't help that I wanted Rosalie to get killed by everyone in the room in a slow and painful way, and even more annoying, I knew that it wouldn't happen, even though she deserves to be put into a gigantic hole of fire, possibly a volcano.    Jacob grew to be a more tolerable character, I guess, and then Bella has her child, and everything comes to a climax, and she's a vampire.    Great!  Wonderful book, with mostly exceptions to that.    But then the book keeps going. I would've been happy if the book just stopped there, but no. It dragged on and on so much that I just quit reading the book, and watched tv for a few hours.     The next day, after my peaceful sleep, I picked the book back up again, and read quite uninterestedly as Alice ran with her husband, and the Volturi came...and nothing happened.    Oh, what happened to the pulse pounding climax (well, second climax, or possibly third by this point) that she normally has at the end?    Oh wait, there wasn't one.    Hmm.    Everyone was fine. No one died, everyone was safe, and everyone lived happily ever after.     Though I don't find it a suitable ending to the series, I find it much better than Harry Potter 7, and don't even get me started on that waste of time and money.    So my recommendation - go out and read it, whether you buy it, borrow it, or whatever else you have to do, just so you can finish the series. It's abit boring, but she does succeed in giving you closure, even if it is sort of...anti-climatic.

0439023483|4.0|This book was a solid read, completed the just over 300 pages in about a day.  The speed of the read is due to the author's strong and engaging writing style.  The story, while reminiscent of many other similar post-apocalyptic tales, had unique details that really kept me wanting to know more about the world.  While the ending of the actual hunger games portion I found to be a bit trite, I look forward to the next book in this series.
0930289234|5.0|Watchmen places readers in a living breathing world in which \\"Masked Adventurers\\" (vigilantes that most closely resemble Batman as they have no super powers) are sometimes accepted and sometimes rebuked in a dark American reality.<br /><br />There is an exception this description of the book--Dr. Manhattan.  He is all powerful, a superhero who could destroy Batman, Superman, and the Hulk with a single thought and yet may be the weakest super hero of them all.  Despite his scientific brilliance and absolute power, Manhattan is unable to grasp moral concepts.  When it comes to morality, he is fledgling child.<br /><br />Watchmen presents a world in which Nixon is still the president of the United States in 1985 and it looks like his wildly successful presidency may go on forever.  In this world, he led us to complete and total victory in Viet Nam.<br /><br />The book begins with police investigating the murder of the Comedian, one of the last of the masked adventurers.  As time goes on, we realize that the Comedian embodies the dark side of society and yet he can also be seen as a patriot.  We are told that he is one of the few people who understood the lunacy of the Vietnamese war, but he embraced it.<br /><br />The Watchmen is high art because of the way it introduces characters and concepts and moralities and plays with them.  This is not a Spider-Man comic in which the entertaining bad guy threatens New York, our hero puts him away, and the people return to whatever they were doing.  This is a book with haunting messages, realistic cruelty, shifting moralities, and more.  It is a book with depth.
B0017V7GLC|5.0|Ladytron is such a unique group, that when one exhausts their discography, there doesn't seem to be any bands that can compare to them. This is why a new album from them is so exciting. Perhaps because they're getting older, the sound of this album is very different from their other work. It carries on from the direction that \\"Destroy Everything You Touch\\" was taking. Still with the signature vintage electro-clash elements but with some rock stylings added, it seems.The song \\"Deep Blue\\" was more like the older music, however. A big surprise was the MALE vocals in \\"Versus\\", which I beleive is not present in any of their other songs. The usual female vocals are better than ever, singing out the very catchy new batch of lyrics. Like always, the music is genius and extremely unique. The best songs are \\"Black Cat\\", \\"Ghosts\\", \\"Predict the Day\\" and \\"Deep Blue\\".

0757307272|5.0|This book tells you everything you need to be successful or at least better your life. I'm a teen myself and I just read the book. Already I feel more motivated to strive for the life that I want. Before reading this, I had no ideas of what I wanted to get out of life or what I even really wanted to do with my time here on Earth. I've recommended the adult version of this book to my single mother because I beleive in the authors ability to help people better themselve and acheive their dreams. Every high-school student should read this book, or even read it at earlier ages.
1416500294|4.0|This book is a fun read.  It starts out with action and that action continues throughout.  This is the quintessential pirates book.  Classic characters like Long John Silver and Jim Hawkins come to life on these pages.  The exploits of Jim and his cohorts aboard the Hispanola aare both believable (to a degree) and entertaining.  Boys will thoroughly enjoy this book but it need not be gender specific (though there is but one female part in this book and that one a minor part at that).  It is fast-paced and just a darn good read.
0765348780|5.0|I'm not surprised that so many people aren't rating this book higher.  It's not an \\"easy\\" read.  The many layers of this book, the hidden meanings and symbols, the various intricacies of politics and betrayal, are not just spoon fed to you.  The magic is interesting and varied, not the generic fire ball fights.   The various Warrens (types of magic used) tapped by various magic users seem to involve not only the talent of the wielder, but often times the personality, the race and societal background of the weaver .  Magic is the casters language.       It takes a closer look as opposed to a \\"power\\" read.       Writers who can weave a story, but lack a higher writing style, i.e. Robert Jordan, Terry Goodkind, J.K. Rowling (all of which I am a fan, mind you, though both Jordan and Goodkind fumbled their series mid-way) don't quite reach the level of writing that George R.R. Martin and Steven Erickson achieve.  While Martin and Erickson don't reach the level of what would be considered literature, they strive for it and come close.    (4.5 stars) 5 stars to balance the poor reviews.
B00151G08Y|5.0|dang i've been listening to this album non stop. it's that good, pretty much pendulum , but with some more flavor. They have some spanish riifs, ol school voice filter melody's like the 80's,dub step,Breakbeat, they even have a freakin cowbell in one of the tracks, who uses a cowbell. They make all the elements blend together so nice, and even tho this album is a mix bag of genres in one, they make it blend seamlessly. with some good ol classic synth work. Pendulums production is always top notch imo, and the details they add are truly the genius behind their work
B0000AQS0F|5.0|...I can't stop coming back to this series.  Every 6 months or so I see it beckoning me from the DVD shelf, and I hole up for a weekend and watch the whole thing.  Every time the end is near I'm left wanting for more as well.    I doubt there will ever be another series like it, and I'm sad for that.
B000S559VW|5.0|While \\"Surfer Rosa\\" is probably the Pixies best album, this is my favorite.  Which is the same as the Manic Street Preachers, because while I know that their album \\"The Holy Bible\\" is without a doubt their best, it is also their most abrasive.  That is why I prefer \\"Everything Must Go\\" for the Manic Street Preachers and \\"Doolittle\\" for the Pixies.    Now, a lot of people might not even know who the Manic Street Preachers are, which is too bad, but even more might not understand the comparison.  Here it is: Artistic as you can be, you need to some joy in your music to make it fun to listen to, and neither \\"The Holy Bible\\" nor \\"Surfer Rosa\\" have very much of that.  But \\"Doolittle\\"...just listen to \\"Here Comes Your Man\\", \\"Debaser\\", \\"Hey\\", \\"Monkey Gone To Heaven\\", or even \\"Gouge Away\\" and you'll see how much fun and freedom the Pixies had with Gil Norton as a producer as opposed to Steve Albini.    As far as desired aesthetic, Steve Albini was very similar to Richey James in that they both wanted an autonomous execution for \\"Surfer Rosa\\" and \\"The Holy Bible\\" respectively.  Yet the albums that came after these two let loose their iron fisted grips were jubilant in their freedom.  (While I know it was very sad that Richey James had to disappear, I do not know if the Manic Street Preachers could have made an album as fun as \\"Everything Must Go\\" with him around, same as Steve Albini for the Pixies).    Am I making a statement that the two albums from each era were equal in scope and greatness even if different in execution?  Yes I am.  Both \\"Doolittle\\" and \\"Everything Must Go\\" are the most enjoyable albums from each group and should be listed among the best albums for the 80s and 90s respectively.
031606792X|5.0|I don't want to go into detail on why I really liked the book, I just wanted my vote to count. I feel like the boards are being flooded with nagativity. Sure there are things about the book I would have liked to change but isnt every book that way? You can't have it be exactly the way you want. I think its a great happy ending to the series, and leaves it open for future books. To all the people who are so stuck on the \\"rules\\" of this world SM created, just let it go. They were never written in stone. And why can't something change anyway? It happens in real life, discoveries of new things and such. Read it and enjoy it for the romantic fantasy that it is. Its not supposed to be the most critically acclaimed piece of literature out there, its just a love story with a happy ending.
1400064287|5.0|The Heath brothers have created one of the best and most memorable contributions to true marketing creativity. They utilize off-the-beaten path stories and analogies to bring their concepts to life and help the reader visualize the benefits of sticky marketing. While some reviewers have said the book was hard to get through, I'd urge you to stick with the book to the end -- and start making a habit of reading the Heath brothers' column in Biz Week
031606792X|2.0|I was really excited for this book - the other 3 were pretty engaging and had a lot going on, so I had high hopes for this book.  I really don't like how neatly everything came together at the end.  I think there was a lot of potential for a better story than what we were given.  SM is a great author - as seen in the previous books she has written.  This book just seemed like a half-hearted effort.
031606792X|1.0|This was garbage.  It's offensive, idiotic, misogynistic bullcrap that reads like a 12 year olds fanfic.      Then again so were the first three so I don't see why everyone's getting into a tizzy now.
031606792X|5.0|Breaking Dawn is the perfect way to end the series.  This book is filled with many twists and shocking surprises.  In the end, everyone got the happily-ever-after they all deserved and worked so hard to get.  In this book, we get to see how each character matures and changes.  We clearly see how much Bella and Edward's relationship has grown in strength since Bella's first day in Forks.  I have never read anything better than the Twilight series, Breaking Dawn included.  I honestly do not understand why there are so many bad reviews.  I believe that Stephenie Meyer's message is to just believe.  Believe in yourself, believe in your love and believe that good will always win over evil (all of which Bella did).   Stephenie Meyer has once again took a completely fictional world and made it as if the reader were actually part of it. The reader can actually feel what Bella and the rest of the characters feel.  Only Stephenie Meyer could pull this off.  This was has been the best book I've read since Eclipse.  Stephenie Meyer's amazing writing pulls you in and you don't want it to let go.  AMAZING JOB STEPHENIE MEYER! AMAZING!
B0000E6XH3|5.0|The movie is amazing. I have been a Daft Punk fan for a long time and i needed this for part of my collection. Though no dialog is in the movie, you can understand what all is going on by the music and the outstanding animation. Daft Punk has amazing vision, and they should do another animated feature. With the use of their song Harder, Better, Faster, Stonger in the Kanye West song Stonger, this will probably bring about more fans for Daft Punk
B0019HQIFE|5.0|I buy discs rarely. I usually just rent from Netflix, which is where I managed to find this gem. I liked John Mayer's music before, I appreciate the man's talent even more after watching this live performance.    If you like his album Continuum or the bluesy John Mayer Trio, you should definitely check this out. His voice and skills with the guitar shine in this performance. On Blu-Ray the quality of the video stands out as well.   I'm buying this one, it merits playing over and over.
0062502174|5.0|lots of psychology in this one, it really wants the reader to fulfil their potential and chase their dreams. if you ever need inspiration to achieve a goal, this book is a great read
031606792X|1.0|I want to cry I'm so disappointed. Who really wrote this book? It couldn't have been SM. Bella pregnant? Naming her baby Renesmee (how about Elizabeth)? JACOB IMPRINTING ON BELLA AND EDWARDS BABY!! I used to be on team Jacob, now he is just sickening. Where was Edward in this book? All he did was sit around and listen to other peoples thoughts. I know I'm whining I don't care I'm allowed I'm 16. Shouldn't Charlie be dead? Not that I want him to die, but shouldn't the Volturi have killed him because he knows too much.  Why was everything wrapped up so pretty? Why didn't we get an awesome battle at the end? What happened to Leah? Why didn't she and Jacob get together? Now that makes sense. I work hard at my  after school job at McDonalds, I want my money back for this book!
B0018PH3L0|3.0|Apparently this was shot 4:3, but has been cropped to 1.78:1 for widescreen TV's.  I haven't seen the transfer, and to be fair, reviewers here and at other sites don't seem to be bothered by it, but I wonder why they didn't put it out in the original aspect ratio and let non-purists zoom or (God forbid) stretch the image.    When I saw that the new DVD was in WS, I had hoped that it had been shot wide (perhaps for a possible European theatrical release) and then cropped to it's intended TV ratio, but alas...    Cropping the top and bottom of a 4:3 image is just as disrespectful to the original creator's intent as is cropping the sides of a wide image.  I hope that as widescreen TV's proliferate this doesn't become a trend.
031606792X|5.0|I loved this book.  I loved that it moved into more mature themes-it had to to portray true love and the trials that come (even in the fantasy world).  I thought the romance was stronger, deeper; the ties to family were absolute and, yes, realistic; and the character development unparalleled.  I feel I \\"know\\" the characters even better now, and I am a better person for the experience.
031606792X|5.0|thank you stephenie for sucking in this 32 yr old reader. i have read all the books over three times and i'm sure i will read them many more times. your characters are amazing and i loved the journey you took me on!!! breaking dawn is awesome....i hope this isnt the end of the cullen family.  BRAVO!!!!!    boo to the haters!!!!!

031606792X|3.0|The overall magic was missing for me.  I can't say that I hated this book, but I can't say that I loved it either.  I got everything I wanted.  A wedding, a new addition to the Cullen family, Jacob, Edward & Bella all resolving their love issues...essentially a happily ever after scenario.  Then why was my fulfillment empty?<br /><br />Stephenie Meyer is an incredible writer, I certainly couldn't put the book down. She never ceases to keep my attention; making me want a resolution.  On the other hand, how we arrived there in this book, left me with mixed feelings.<br /><br />I saw storylines that could have been amazing that were left unexplored.  For example, I would have been interested to see Jacob struggle emotionally with who and what he had imprinted with. But nothing.<br /><br />Another missed opportunity I thought the author could have explored was Edward's feelings about something he never could have dreamed of, that was never supposed to happen, happening with Bella.  The fear for Bella's life, I got.  But afterwards, this life-altering, mind-blowing change that was never supposed to happen to him.  How did he feel now that the storm had passed?  But nothing.<br /><br />In the end, good writer, happy ending...but the magic was somehow missing.
031606792X|4.0|I know a lot of people are unhappy with Breaking Dawn, but I enjoyed 90% of it.  Of course, I'm not a teenage girl, and neither is the author.  A happy ending for her, would include a honeymoon and a baby.  My biggest disappointment was the anticlimatic confrontation with the Volturi.  I personally loved the whole Jacob POV, especially the snarky titles.  Having read the series multiple times, and the author's website, I wasn't that surprised that she tried to tie up all the loose ends.  I'm still upset by the deaths of so many of my favorite characters in \\"The Deathly Hallows\\", so I'm not going to complain about BD.  Accept it for what it is.
031606792X|1.0|I am currently up to page 501 and I'm struggling to finish this waste of paper. Why in the world is it so long and drawn out? The past 500 pages could have been written into two or three chapters! Bella's constant self absorbed worries are driving me mental!<br /><br />I always knew that Stephenie's writing is long and drawn out and descriptive, but while that worked for the first three novels - this is just utterly tedious!<br /><br />Not only that, but this entire book is reading like a fanfiction. I cannot believe that Stephenie wrote in my ultimate story breaker - pregnancy. And it just keeps getting worse and worse and worse!<br /><br />The first chapter was good. But everything has gone down hill from there. Everyone is out of character, Bella has lost all her qualities that made fans relate to her and she's turned into a Mary-Sue. Edward has lost every little characteristic that made people fall in love with him. Jacob is still relatively the same, but imprinting on the baby? WTF??<br /><br />Not only that, but I feel like the book is advocating getting married young, having kids, and being completely dependent on some guy. Bella has no independence, no individual thoughts, no respect for her well being, she puts herself in danger for the sake of others. Plus, she's relying on Edward and the Cullen's for everything! Money, home, clothes, safety etc. Where in the world did a little bit of independance and girl power go? Its sickening to read.<br /><br />I don't even want to finish this book. I wish I never started it. Stephenie was on something funky when she wrote this book. And you know what the worst thing is? After all the crazy stuff in this book, I bet it all get wraps up nicely with a little bow! Gag.<br /><br />I thought The Host was bad - but somehow this is even worse!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|One of the few shows I can truely say that I loved.  The strange thing is that I never watched it on TV when it was on, even though I knew it was on and would occasionally catch a show but never finish watching one for some reason.  I was used to my Star Trek/Stargate type of shows, and found Firefly too different.  Eventually, there was a sci-fi low for me as I caught up with all of my other sci-fi shows, and I decide to give the series a try starting from the beginning by watching it on DVD.  I was hooked after the first few shows and I couldn't believe I almost missed out on one of the best shows ever.  There are a lot of things to like about Firefly and a lot of things that are a bit contrived or cliche, but the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.  What really sets Firefly part from other sci-fi I would have to say is its humor.  I've never laughed out loud so much watching a sci-fi show.  In the end, it's unfortunate they weren't able to let the story unfold at a slower rate instead of jam packing everything into Serenity.  While Serenity was a good movie, I felt the story was too rushed.  Even so, this short series should not be missed.  Definitely one of the best ever.
031606792X|2.0|an author who breaks the rules of her own fictional world to give readers a happy ending.  I wanted a happy ending resolution in Breaking dawn, but not at the expence of the first 3 books in the saga.<br /><br />I didn't give it only 1 star, because I found that the story was entertaining enough to keep me up reading, however I was too invested in the characters that I got to know in the first 3 books to overlook the fact that Meyer ignored all the rules, consequences and stuggle the heroine went through to get to this point just to be able to give ALL aspects of the story a happy ending.
031606792X|5.0|SPOILERS BELOW!!!    Okay...so people seem to have a lot problems with some things in the book and I thought I would share my thoughts about them.  I happened to like the book a lot and that's not just because I am a big fan of the author.    As for Bella getting pregnant... Many people argue that it makes no sense because Bella didn't ever want children before.  True, she didn't, although she did think about it when she kissed Jacob in Eclipse.  You can't deny that there was some interest there.  The fact is that she probably never even thought of having children with Edward because she didn't think it was possible.  Maybe if she knew it was, her idea about wanting children would be different.  After all, she says that because it was HIS child she wanted to keep it.  Some say that having a child does not make you automatically responible or grown up, and that might be true in most cases.  But I do believe that people can grow from the experience and can make a valiant effort at being as responsible as they can.  I think it's Bella's love for Edward (all things Edward, even his offspring) that makes her want to keep the child and be mature and responsible for its sake.  Sure, she did some crazy things in the past that might not make her the best candidate for motherhood, but who hasn't?  It's the hard times, the crazy things we experience, that help us grow and mature.      As for Jacob imprinting on Renesmee (yes, the name is a little weird), I think it fits perfectly.  Jacob always knew that his and Bella's destinys were entwined.  It's not a sick relationship...he is merely like a protector at this stage in the game, not a lover.  Anyone who has read the series knows that he will be anything she needs - a brother, a friend, a lover, etc.  If he had imprinted on someone else entirely, some stranger, he probably wouldn't have continued to be a very big part of Bella's life at all.  Bella still loves him as a friend.  I would hate to see him out of the picture completely.      I do think a good fight at the end would have been good....but I think the way it ended was good too.  The book was not without it's suspense.  I was on the edge of my seat the whole time I read it.  Maybe it was a little anticlimatic, but what's wrong with a happy ending?  I love the fact that everyone can be happy.     As for the sex thing...Of course she wants to have sex all the time!  She is a newlywed!  Not to mention that it is new to her and its with Edward!  Those of you who can't understand that probably have never been with someone they are madly, truly in love with or have never been married (or had sex for that matter).      One last thing - did you ever think that maybe Stephenie didn't intend to send out a message to teenage girls at all?  Maybe she intended for this to be purely a fantasy, something based on things that aren't real with no intention of forcing ideas or a message onto anyone?  My thoughts are that if you are looking for some profound message or some guide to living life, read the Bible, or something like that.  At least something designed for that kind of thing.  Fiction is not the best category to choose for learning life lessons - it's based on stuff that isn't real, things that don't always occur in real life.  If you can't decipher between reality and fantasy, maybe you shouldn't read fiction at all.      Overall I am very happy with this book and I think Stephenie is brilliant.  She thought of things that I wouldn't have ever imagined.  For me, a book with suprises is better than a book that goes according to everyone's expectation.  How boring would it be to have Bella and Edward get married, have sex, her turn into a vampire and kill people, prove to the Volturi she's not human, and then live happily ever after?  Not much of a thrill in my opinion.
031606792X|4.0|I loved all the other books in this series, but this one was just a little weak. The suspense was powerful, Just the waiting for all the \\"things\\" that keep happening to & for Bella was amazing. But I felt that the ending was just a little empty. Not to mention that it still left a little wiggle room for more.  All & all, I liked it but not loved it. But it won't stop me from reading again & again. =}
031606792X|2.0|This book came out of left field. It didn't seem to flow out of the previous series at all. I guess if you look at the book as a single stand alone novel, it's not a bad read. But if you loved the twighlight story and are looking for your next fix, it's a big disappointment.
031606792X|4.0|This book was totally not what I expected--especially the whole Jacob imprinting thing. Still not sure about that. But overall, I found Breaking Dawn satisfying. I especially liked how Bella came into her own being a vampire--how she finally felt she belonged somewhere. I also liked that Bella found her super power, and that she ended up being able to be a true asset in the fight, like she spent the entire series wishing she could do.    Overall, good read. And congratulations to Stephenie Meyer on how far she's come from first writing Twilight!
031606792X|5.0|Don't take it too seriously, folks. It's a modern-day fairy tale--pure fantasy--and those who take it to be more than this need to lighten the heck up.    As in the first three books in the Twilight series, Meyer deftly weaves together humor, emotion, romance and the supernatural--without all the expletives and gratuitous sex and violence you'll be sure to find elsewhere. Even so, there's a lot in the series--and particularly in Breaking Dawn--of which parents should be aware. While Meyer is never sexually explicit, she does present a lot of material that might overwhelm immature readers. And Breaking Dawn definitely upped the gross factor. I know that I cringed over some of the blood and gore.    To me, the characters acted \\"in character.\\" I found myself laughing aloud (not for the first time in the series) at the interactions between Jacob and Rosalie. And I enjoyed some of the surprising developments with Bella.  she grew up in some keys ways. I was likewise impressed with how themes from the earlier books carried through and resolved themselves here. Yeah, sure, there were some loose ends that were tied up a little bit too neatly. But, really folks... Chill out. This is fantasy fiction. These aren't real people. It's just a fun story that plays out as the author intended. I say kudos to Stephenie Meyer for telling a story that's captivated women of all ages (without compromising herself in the process).
0312427999|4.0|This book does a tremendous job decribing the pain and suffering brought on the citizens of the world from corporate power at all cost.  But, the book is not fairly written.  It only presents one side of an argument.    For example, the reason that these countries needed such immediate attention was that they were suffering from hyperinflation with more than half of their citizens employed by corrupt inefficient governments.  In a world of corporate corruption, it is hard to remember how corrupt and inefficient governments can be, but trust me, they will bankrupt a country quickly if given the chance.    It turns out when you look at the statistical evidence across all the countries of the world, that capitalist institutions create not only greater wealth for citizens, but surprisingly, this wealth and income is more fairly divided across all citizens.  And democratic institutions go hand in hand with capitalism, they both try to create greater individual choice and freedom and academics have shown that greater democratic institutions like the vote, civil liberties and a free press encourage economic growth in a country.    Friedman's mistake was not in supporting capitalism as a method for developing countries to escape poverty, but in trusting big corporations to implement fair rules for capitalism.  Instead they instituted monopoly power by industry, lobbying power to write legislation and governmental control to protect their established business positions.  Friedman never saw that big American corporations were violating his ideal world of competitive capitalism just as much as his much hated labor unions and big government.    Just Klein's description of Iraq is worth the price of the book.  Why has the war dragged on and on?  Because defense and reconstruction contractors want it to so as to be able to soak the American taxpayer for as long as possible.  Why do we fight wars that our people are against, because they are profitable.
031606792X|5.0|I am tired of the people who think that for a story to be done right that it has to end badly for the characters of the book.  I have read a lot of books lately to fill the time for Breaking Dawn's release and it was getting to be ridiculous.  Every series I got into always ended with devastation at the end for the characters. It just made me irritated and annoyed.  I was glad that SM took a story that had a lot of characters that had been dealing with internal turmoil and showed how it can still turn out alright.  I am what most would categorize as an optimist and if that makes me crazy well then so be it. Maybe instead of attacking it people can realize that maybe they are the ones who have been tainted. It's okay for things to turn out well...it does happen. As for Bella not being an independent women..seriously get over it.  Women can be married and still be independent.  Why does everyone think that if you're married and really in love with someon and have a family you will lose yourself. Pretty much what I'm saying is that the responses of these posts are too cliche for our society. Start thinking for yourself.
031606792X|5.0|First, I have breast cancer and have been going through treatment for the last 4-plus months. During my diagnosis, tests and treatments, it has been difficult for me to read anything too heavy or depressing.    I have read the Twilight series over the last few months at office visits and during my many hours lying around at home. The great stories and characters have allowed me to escape a little of the trial I am currently dealing with. Thanks to Stephanie Meyer for great story-telling and a little escape.    I looked forward to Breaking Dawn and got the book on Saturday, along with many of her other fans. As I have a lot of down time right now for obvious reasons, I read it in a just few days.    I can't for the life of me understand all of the negative comments about this book. Half way through the book, I literally thought to myself - Stephanie Meyer has done an amazing job of tying together all of the loose pieces in the series together and everyone should be happy with this book and how Bella's story ends. Apparently, I was wrong.    I would remind everyone reading any of Stephanie's books that they are ALL fiction. And, as a fan, I can't imagine why anyone would criticize her for ending the story her way. It's her story! It's her right to tell it the way she sees it.    Any of you with problems with Breaking Dawn need to perhaps read the Twilight series again. Are you really that stunned and surprised at how she ended this? Was it really a possibility that Bella would ever end up with Jacob? There are plenty of clues in the first three books as to where the story was going to go. Why are some people so surprised?     I enjoyed reading this book as much as any of her other books - including The Host. It's not my favorite Stephanie Meyer book. Twilight will probably always be my favorite. But, come on all you negative souls. Give it up. What were you expecting? I'm glad Stephanie Meyer got to write and finish the story. I'm really glad you didn't.    And, whatcould be better than a happy ending? Joe Wright - the director of Pride and Prejudice (not the BBC version - another topic of controversy) and Atonement says that wish fulfillment is important in our literature and stories. With all of the pain and heavy stuff we all go through, isn't it nice to have an escape and a happy ending once in a while?
4770030096|5.0|I am what I would call an 'advanced beginner'. I have taken several 3 month trips to Japan and even more two week vacations and speak enough to get around. Depsite this, there are gaps in my learning since I have not studied any one book on my own all the way through. A friend and I decided to study together once a week using this book (at his recommendation). It is the best book I have ever worked with. One of the things that makes this such a great series - on top of the structure - is that there are a reasonable amount of writing exercises. They break out the conversations and vary them for different ways to practice the material. With this kind of practice I really feel that I am gaining proficiency. Since I plan to study to a fluent level, I really enjoy this kind of practice even though I know 95% or more of the vocabulary in the first few chapters. My friend and I then meet once a week after doing the 'homework' on our own and practice the vocabulary by reading through the exercises. This also gives us a chance to have someone check our spelling by circling the mistakes that we make. (We both already know some Japanese and still make mistakes, it's part of learning) ;)<br /><br />We also really like that there are three levels to the series for the obvious reason that we both want to study until we are fluent.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book for anyone that wants to study on their own or as a small group.<br /><br />I have to add that we also use Remebering the Kanji 1 and 2 by James W. Heisig (also purchased through Amazon). By going through one chapter a week of both materials (For Busy People 1-3 and Rememering the Kanji 1 & 2) in about 2 years we will have Japanese proficiency FAR above what could be learned in two years by going to college (I would guess about double and more Kanji than a college undergraduate) for under $150 dollars.
B0017R5UAA|3.0|Don't get me wrong, this is a very good record.  The songs and melodies are there.  The harmonies are beautiful.  But, for some reason, Fleet Foxes just don't stir me.  I have a great respect especially considering the ages of the band members and the level of talent.  However, this might just be a case where the hype surrounding this band kind of killed it for me before I had my first listen.  I dunno... maybe it'll be a grower.
031606792X|4.0|First, I need to say that I am a mother and soon to be grandmother.  My daughter read the books first.  I enjoyed the first three books very much and was looking forward to Breaking Dawn.<br /><br />Was Breaking Dawn what I expected?  No; although I could not tell you what I did expect.  I haven't read all the 1000+ reviews, but have read a representative sample.<br /><br />I waited a couple of days to consider the book and these are my thoughts.<br /><br />I think a lot of people are missing what I believe is the point of Breaking Dawn.  In the first three books, Bella sees herself as weak  when she would like to be strong, she does not think she fits into her world.  Her loved ones have to protect her from danger.  She cannot understand why Edward loves her.<br /><br />In Breaking Dawn, Bella matures into a strong, capable woman who is able to take care of the people she loves instead of seeing herself as a constant burden.  It appears she was (spoiler) \\"born to be a vampire\\".  She becomes a shield who can protect her loved ones from her enemies.<br /><br />More than just the \\"Happily Ever After\\" with Edward (who continues to adore her), Bella comes into her own in this book.  I miss the nerdy little klutz, but I am happy for her.
031606792X|4.0|I'm not sure I understand all the negative reviewing for this book.  I feel that Stephenie Meyer had a lot to live up to with this novel, a lot of pressure to please everyone; The Jacob fans and the Edward fans.  I feel like she did a great job.  Was it a little too perfect? Yes.  Would that really happen in the Real World? No.  But the last time I checked this was a Fantasy novel about Vampires and Werewolves!!  Personally, I think her character development, and the history she gets into, is extremely creative.  She makes the reader (if they're open) actually believe that this world could exist.  I felt a strong bond with all the characters, something not many writers succeed at.  Also, being it was written for young readers, she did a superb job with the love scenes, keeping it innocent and appropriate.  I will admit, when the baby came into play, I was a little skeptical.  But throughout the rest of the book, I became more open to the idea, especially since Renesmee played such an important role.  As for Bella's part, obviously there is something special about her, she was in love with a vampire as a human... So I feel it was only right to give her a special talent as a vampire.  Would you have expected any less? Overall, I loved the series in its entirety, and I hope to read more of her work in the future.
031606792X|5.0|I agree this whole series is a powerful fairy tale.  I am a 47 year old with a Masters Degree in Public Administration.  I got my Bachelor's Degree 3 months after turning 20, have a full career, and waited till I was 27 to marry the right man and start a family.  I say this to preface that I am an overachiever with realistic views of the world.  This story shows how family pulled together, how love involved continuing sacrifice, and how the old-fashioned values of marriage first and the subsequent sactity of life gave Bella her first taste of true happiness with a marked decrease in her sense of \\"I'm not worthy\\".  She's matured a lot over the years (starting with caring for her mother, who was so child-like).  She is mature enough to be a wife and mother.  Not all girls are, nor should all young people get married.  When I felt my first baby's kick at the age of 27, it was new to me and I felt such joy over the reality of that precious life within me - no freaking out as one reviewer put it.  Jacob is NOT a pedophile (look at Claire and one of the other pack members) - he is drawn to protect \\"Nessie\\", he NEVER imprinted on Bella, though he wanted to, and when the time is right, his relationship will progress in a proper manner.  I think the outrage over the \\"message\\" and the choice of baby name, etc, etc simply shows how real these characters are to us and the phenominal job Stephanie has done.  BUT, this is a story, it is a fairy tale, and should be enjoyed as such.
031606792X|2.0|I'd like to begin by stating that I'm a huge fan of the first three books.  Also, I'm probably a bit older than most Twilight saga fans as I got interested in the series when my 15 y/o daughter and her friends went completely nuts over it.  Wanting to know the fuss, I read (so did my husband) and enjoyed...immensely!  My daughter and I were so excited for the Breaking Dawn release that I took her to a midnight release party and purchased two books so we can read it simultaneously.  Sadly, the excitement ended there for both of us.  This book had me scratching my head wondering if S.M. really wrote this.  All the feeling and character development I loved so much in the first three was gone.  It felt odd and uncomfortable as though the characters were forced to act beyond their will. Of the infinite number of directions this finale could have gone, this was shockingly disappointing.  I'm left with trying to salvage my affection for the first three.
B0000630YA|5.0|Alice Cooper originally was the name of the band.  They broke up in 1974 and Alice the singer went solo.  IMHO this is best solo Alice, and one of the best rock albums ever!    It ranks with up there with Dark Side of the Moon, Zepplin 4, Sgt. Pepper's and all the other \\"greats\\"    It was also the 1st time Vincent Price appeared on a popular music recording.   That's right - the so-called King of Pop borrowed that idea from the Coop.  Everyone who appreciates good music should have this in their collection.
031606792X|1.0|I could go on and on about the ackward story structure, the horrid characterization of Bella, Edward and Jacob, the WTF moments scattered throughout the book, the lack of plot and how she pretty much kills the romance between Edward and Bella but I don't understand how this is considered a happy ending when Jacob does something creepy to the newborn and Bella is cool with it? And the implications of the 7 years later is just far too disturbing for my taste.
B000002H70|5.0|The world has seen such great works by the likes of Mozart, Chopin, The Beatles, Elton John, Led Zeppelin, Bob Dylan, etc. Their music has inspired generations and has helped them established their role in the annals of music history. Above all their great works, there is, however, one musical work of art that will forever stand as the single greatest compilation of songs ever put together to form an album. That album is The Cure's Disintegration. It is indeed a masterpiece. The music contained in this album could not have been done any better. It is perfect in everyway. It is a musical journey that takes the listener to emotional worlds that are only limited by the imagination. It is dark, sorrowful, complex, and intense. The compositions speak of despair, loneliness, forgotten love, and desolate places. It is a true testament of the beauty of music in all its glory. It is an example of what human beings are capable of accomplishing. To this date, nothing in the world of music has approached the level of beauty and grandeur of Disintegration. Quite frankly, nothing before Disintegration approached the level of beauty and grandeur of Disintegration. Before Disintegration, the world was content with Sgt. Pepper's. After Disintegration, there was nothing left to do. The pinnacle of music was reached. Disintegration is proof that God does indeed exist.
031606792X|4.0|All right, I'm trying not to be subjective here. AND I'm trying not to be as cynical as many of the other reviewers on here; it's hard to do , but I'm going to try.      I love the first three books with fierce intensity. I was so excited to get this fourth book in my hands that I went to the midnight release party as a 32-year-old mother and weathered the storm with 300 or so 14-year-olds. I dived right in, and at first loved it. It was just what I'd hoped for. I can honestly say that I did have several moments that I was unsure I had misread (SPOILER ALERT! Jacob's imprinting, Alice's abandonment, the baby's name, etc. etc. etc. etc. or the inconsistencies such as why vamps cannot cry tears and have venomous saliva, yet they can apparently produce completely non-harmful sperm but i digress.) but I kept on reading.     I also can say that I wasn't nearly as disappointed in any of that as I was in the end. I mean, we read 50 or so pages of this possible throw down between the Cullens and the Volturri, and for what? Absolutely nothing. No battle. No real resolution. Nothing. Not even the promise of another book to rectify everything that built up to the confrontation. UGH!     That aside, I am not entirely disgusted with the book. I'm not upset that I spent my time reading it. I'm not even as upset as many with the nice big red shiny bow SM wrapped the story with. Maybe I'm a romantic and an optimist after all, but I'm glad everyone was happy. But it doesn't compare to the other three books. Not one tiny bit.
031606792X|1.0|I've enjoyed the Twilight Series and was excited, beyond excited for Breaking Dawn to come out. However, the last book far exceeded my worst nightmare for how bad this book could be. Forget unnecessarily disgusting on many levels the writing lacked any type of character development or insight. And while Stephanie Meyer captured Bella's voice beautifully she cannot write from a male's perspective. The book was vile and untrue to the characters that Meyer has created. I've lost all excitement for the movie this December.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I have seen some negative reviews about this book. That is a fact i simply cannot comprehend. All of Meyer's books are so well-written and colorful that they would be classics even if they had a poor storyline.    I do NOT think they have a crappy storyline, however. I don't get why people have a problem with Breaking Dawn. I think it's a very satisfying ending. To those one-star revieweres- what's your problem with everyone getting a happily ever after?
031606792X|5.0|I'm pretty sure by the time we read the first book and saw how much the story was about vampires and the supernatural, it was understood that it would be a story that was not exactly realism.     I know, I know:  NEWS FLASH, I'm sure.    And yet, here I am, reading review after review, trying to find someone with half a brain who understands this. No luck yet. \\"90 percent of fans are disappointed\\" \\"BABY WITHOUT SEAT BELT!?!\\" \\"Imprinting on a baby... THAT'S SICK!\\" Ugh.     Yeah yeah yeah, symbolism and all that crap. The Edward being the ultimate forbidden bf. But there's more to this story, or I guess 'less' I should say, that everyone wants to read into it. Let's leave that where it belongs, in your high school literature class, and deal with the story, yes? Even Garcia Marquez probably would not appreciate the crap (the deeper meanings and the stretches and leaps) that's made up about his books. It's not always about a moral. This isn't a toddler's fable about staying out of the woods. It's not even meant for children, no matter what the idiot label at the book stores say. She wrote it for adults, and if you're okay with a child reading a bloody scene about a woman being cut in half as her bones are shattering by her own child and she's spewing blood from her mouth but NOT okay with her (gasp) wanting to have sex before she loses all her humanity, then we have bigger problems here.    Aside from all that, Twilight is a story. A fascinating story about a freak and her freak friends. And I mean that in the nicest way possible. Bella has never been normal, and she identifies with vampires and werewolves... Big surprise that her life isn't normal. Therefore, you can't apply normal constructs to this unusual world. Half-vampire babies don't need baby seats, because, guess what, they're half-vampire! Normal baby's wouldn't survive if anything happened while Bella was driving (which it wouldn't solely because she's a vampire), but then normal babies wouldn't crush theirmothers spine or break her ribs. I think it's fairly safe to say Renesmee wouldn't get hurt...    I'll admit, Jacob's situation with Renesmee is a bit more than freaky and twisted. I think that's something everyone can agree on. I think it would be better if he imprinted on someone new or Leah or something, but in its own, awkward, sick way, Bella's baby makes sense.... Still makes me feel a bit dirty. But aside from that, I think the novel did a very good job rounding out the series. I personally hated Eclipse because of the nasty triangle that Meyer created (specifically the completion of the triangle with Bella magically falling in love with Jacob), and I was really worried about this book, but I was far from disappointed. In fact, with this last chapter in the saga, the series is back to being amazing in my eyes. I can deal with Eclipse's blunder thanks to Breaking Dawn, and that is saying a lot.   And \\"wah,wah,wah, Bella gets everything she wants\\" people? It's essentially a chickflick on paper... Deal with it or go read Whuthering Heights or something.     So do us all a favor and understand that sometimes a story is just that, and not meant to send a heated, flamboyant, and racy message to the masses, young adult or not.
031606792X|5.0|I'm so disappointed at a lot of the comments about this book. It was a really powerful book, full of messages of love and friendship and the invisible bonds of human relationships.  *spoiler* Sure, it had a perfect ending, but isn't that good? We live in a world where everything seems hard, working against us sometimes, but books like this one can give us hope. It's a fiction story, but I believe that happily ever afters are not just found in fiction.   By reading this book, not only I read a beautiful story but I grasped better difficult concepts such as love.   Bella is a complex character, the story is complex, and although the situations are fictional the feelings are not. I will miss my Twilight fantasy world, but I'm glad I was able to be a part of it :)
031606792X|5.0|I'm very tired of all the hateful reviews on this book.  I think it was a great story and a perfect ending to the Twilight saga!  I loved it!
B001AX60KU|5.0|Just listen to the music on these cd's and you will find out why he  is known as the king of rock and roll.even forty years after the original  album was released it still sounds as fresh as ever.an absolute must for  all music lovers
B00005JKC3|5.0|Yes I can see why die hard fans of comic book are upset.  The change in story line origin, etc...  And I can see why violence and action addicts would prefer another movie.<br /><br />Well they can have it, I'm tired of so much violence.  The Dark knight should have been R rated, comic book movies are geared for kids and they get worse and worse.<br /><br />Granted The Dark knight is still good, I could have done with less violence.<br /><br />That's not the case with Hulk.  It has the right amount without going overboard and it has brains too.  It's not just wham bam done!  I like thinking movies and I'm a patient person.  The payoff was great in this movie.<br /><br />The Incredible Hulk with Ed was good too but I this one is much better.  The Hulk is closer to the comic book style.  Eric Bana was just as good as Ed, if not better because he's way sexier :-)<br /><br />Ang Lee was much better as a director and the style of the movie (comic book look, split screens) was excellent.<br /><br />I'm ok with both interpretations of the origin story.  I wish they would make a sequel to Ang Lee's version actually.  I think it was smarter.
031606792X|5.0|I have been a huge 100% strong fan of Twilight and August 2nd was definitely my own personal Christmas. I knew that no matter what happened in the books, that I still would love Edward and Bella. Obviously, spoilers..     Bella did marry Edward. To the bare bone, that was all Twilighter's wish. Then she turns into a vampire.. THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT THING TO any Edward Lover. Down to the deep core of it, thats was my only importance. That and the fact that Jacob hadnt gotten her..xDD Totally.     Jacob imprinting on Bella's daughter was just like. o.o okay? Like we just needed someone to peacefully end the story about Jacob. So he falls in love with another. I just wish he was gone forever.. o.o but that aint happening. He's gonna be a son and law. Which is wierd =/     The daugher was completely like.. o.o wow. I can expect that from Steph. She is a mother of three boys and Bella getting pregnant wasnt expected of the series but was of the author. But suddrenly, when the daugher became more important then Edward... that wasnt right xD     But to the deep core. I loved the book. It had a happy ending with Bella and Edward being able to live in peace with their family. It ends with forever. Nothing wrong can happen to them anymore which perfect. Bella can now fend for herself and still loved Edward more then anything. Thats whta I wanted. The love to still be strong and powerful. That happened. Any Twiligher will definately enjoy that. Ignoring the daughter. I loved the book. It was unexpected, it was fair, and it was made only for those who truely had TWilight close to their hearts.
031606792X|2.0|I agree with many of the reviewers that there were many things so far fetched it was almost shocking.  Also, the climax at the end was like running off a cliff into a giant peice of foam.    Pros: Ms. Meyer is able to capture very specific emotions in her writing.   Cons: 18 yr old and a 90 yr old getting together. 17 yr old \\"imprinting\\" on a newborn.
031606792X|1.0|This is not at all the conclusion to the saga that I was expecting.  I don't understand how there are any positive reviews out there, and I have been a fan of this series and was just as eagerly awaiting this book as everyone else but I only have two words: Epic Fail.
031606792X|5.0|Well, I have to say that I LOVED Breaking Dawn and I really feel like it was my favorite of the series.  There was something so gratifying about seeing Bella and Edward grow up the way that they did.  I understand that some people seem to believe that it was too fairy tale, but that was exactly what I wanted.  I have grown to love and admire these characters and to know that everything worked out in their lives is such a great finale to their life story.  The events in Breaking Dawn did give the characters much grief and strife, but they persevered, just as I would hope that they would.  I know that any die hard Twilight fan has probably already read Breaking Dawn, but if you are on the fence about reading it, just do it.  It is an incredible ending to one of the greatest literary romances of this time. Enjoy!  :o)
B0019IB26I|5.0|I love this cd. Once again John has pulled it off. He's wonderful, I love the diversity and I would highly recommend it.
031606792X|1.0|Okay, I'm not going to lie: I am addicted to Twilight.  I own actual, physical copies of the first three books and the copy of Breaking Dawn I ordered from Amazon is on the way (I read an online version).  But I really cannot understand why anyone, ANYONE, can treat it seriously.  The entire series is filled with convenient plot devices, shallow, one-dimensional characters, and Meyer is not a very concise writer, which means that the books are long.  Really long.<br /><br />I'll admit the initial plot is engaging: deadly yet benevolent vampires, a forbidden love.  All very marketable and appealing.  What bothers me is the lack of skill with which the stories are executed.  Meyer's writing is not bad, it's just amateurish.  Quite honestly, I think I or any other of my friends could have written it the way she had, and I'm not even out of high school.  Everything in Breaking Dawn slots neatly into place, making all the fuss that precluded it practically useless.  What was the point of building all that up if it's just going to resolve it anyway?<br /><br />I hear people comparing her series to Harry Potter and Pride and Prejudice, and wince.  I sincerely hope that the masses don't feel this way, or else I'll lose faith in society's ability to judge quality forever.
031606792X|5.0|this book was great :) i was very pleased with the HAPPY ENDING because through all the books there has been so much unease and conflict that it was a comfort that the characters were still alive in the end. YAY for happy endings!!!!!
B0018PH3L0|5.0|People who are complaining about a cropped 4:3 image are wrong, at least according to the director.  Simon Wincer says in the new bonus features that Lonesome Dove was orginally shot on film in widescreen and was actually previewed to the media and VIPs in that format.  It is that widescreen film master that was used to produce the new DVD and Blu-Ray releases.
0743486285|5.0|On advice from a friend in rehab who read it i bought it brand new. Did not stop reading it except to sleep and eat...period. Thirty six hours later i felt as spent as he did, without the crakheads and dirty needles. I really felt for the character...because as real as he lived it it is still a ROCKSTAR's portrayal of addiction. Nobody i know has ever been that high but alot have been that low. Not so much a book of \\"you can kick dope too\\" book as a \\"I went this far and lived\\" book to me. My only complaint was the price and since some of that goes to a charity if you can afford to, buy it new.
