B00A6CCF0K|4.0|this was not as scary as the shining , but had its moments. i really liked the characters in this book. the plot was way different the the first book. it did leave me hoping he writes another sequel to this \\"series\\". i recommend this book.
B00BIKCYAU|4.0|What can I say? This is hands down the best series I have seen, nothing else comes close. I’m not much for shows but this even surpasses many films. Great story, writing, acting, production and direction. The only issues I have with the blu-ray is that the 1st disc will not play in my new *Samsung smart BD player and that it’s not 7.1 (not sure why but it’s 5.1).<br /><br />*  The discs play fine on my old Sony BD player.
1575666286|5.0|I highly recommend any of the Gerson Therapy books for people that would like to be or remain in good health.
B002LC2DQ4|4.0|I needed a memory card, this is what I got the only one to fit the camera. I like it.
B002JCSWV6|5.0|Based on the true story how can anyone refuse this?!?  I love movies based on facts, they are so inspirational and this one is definitely that.  Highly recommended.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I really liked this puzzle app it uses lots of small pictures to create a bigger image<br />this puzzle also creates some small challenges.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Vince Gill and Paul Franklin mine the vaults of Merle Haggard and Buck Owens for a polished album of 10 great songs.  If you like great musicianship, strong vocals and good songwriting, this CD is for you.  If not, listen to the new junk your local &#34;country&#34; radio station is pumping out.  My only complaint is that the CD isn't another 10 songs longer....
B004SVM7BW|1.0|I bought this app a while back and actually liked it and found it useful for the small price. However a recent update changed the program so it will not even open unless you are connected to the internet, making it USELESS to me now, since I would use it often times where I cannot get an internet connection on my tablet. I will NEVER buy from this developer again. Changing how a program fundamentally operates after its bought is bad business. I always find adding internet connection requirements without expressed reason suspicious.
B00915G6MG|5.0|this is our favorite show and we could not wait until it was available, it shipped to us quickly and we are enjoying the discs with no problems.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Great!! Just as the 1st season you can't stop watching.<br />The characters consolidate and bring everything in. Can't wait to start the third season
B00FEHXISA|4.0|Yet another Iron Man  movie I enjoyed immensely.  was taken by surprise as to who the villain actually was.  Great fun!
B00867HDTA|5.0|app is well put together,  it has multiple minigames within it..they all have the same purpose put but are a little different.  I played around 10 minutes and I think I will play again...like other ones have said it's not everyday day buy for a casual gamer...it will work...<br /><br />if flicking is your thing flick soccer won't flick you off!  Happy flicking.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|This is a great Barbie storage bin.  It's larger than I expected.  My daughter holds probably about 20 barbies and 2 Barbie horses in her bin.
B008Y212PI|5.0|It's refreshing to find an honest game anymore and that's fun to play.  This is it.  Perfect to play while waiting for appointments.  Thanks developer!
B003Q6D2BE|4.0|The movie was fun and fast paced...good laughs and filled with some big-name stars too.  If you like action movies with a bit of humor, this is for you.
B005LAII0I|5.0|The movie was in excellent shape and was great to watch. Fast shipping, Loved it, kept you going on what was going to happen.
B00CATONCA|5.0|Great box set , have all the box set from walking dead , a dead on great purchase!!! Whoa bobs whoa thongs whoa Val!!!! (PanterA)
B0063M22QO|4.0|Great for keeping me occupied while waiting for doctors. Quick games, easy to learn.<br />I would recommend this for others.
160774418X|5.0|Love this cookbook! I am not very well acquainted with the different spices used and such however I have very much enjoyed cooking with it !!!
B00ESB75FA|5.0|I was so afraid the &#34;mother&#34; would disappear again until the end of the season.....I'm interested to see how they tie things up - and they are continuing to bring the humor.
B002EDH0FE|5.0|I don't understand why this movie had such bad response. Great fight scenes, good story and characters and im not even familiar with the comic books.
B00E0MCYPS|4.0|The only negative that I have about the game so far, is it can be a little difficult to control, and I think we can blame that on the user.  ;)
B000BNTM96|5.0|Any Queens fan should own this. The quality is amazing and accurately shows what their concerts are really like. I thoroughly enjoyed this and so will you.
B0000065O1|5.0|Love this, this is the 3 rd video like this I have ordered! The best workout for women. You won't be sorry!
1936608898|5.0|I would recommend this to everyone who is looking to improve their diet.  This is informative, motivating and insightful for all people who are searching for improvement and knowledge of the foods that they are eating.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Both of my children and myself love this game. I hope you get this app ,enjoy puzzle games again and again.
B000I5X81A|5.0|great album and terrific music. got here on time and in great shape. would recommend to anyone enjoying music. the best...........
B009NH6JRE|5.0|I remember the emotional ride it was to watch season three episode by episode as it aired on AMC. It was so dramatic waiting another week to watch what happened next. I knew halfway through the season I wanted it on Blu-Ray as soon as it was released. I preordered it. Amazon continued to send monthly E-Mails saying they didn't have a release date yet, and that was expected. As long as I got it as soon as it came out. And I did. I could sit there and watch all the episodes without having to wait a week. I highly recommend checking this show out. It's so gripping.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|A perfect substitute for going out and spending ridiculous amounts of cash.  A great time at home with good friends/family.
140525355X|5.0|I purchased the Mr. Men books for my two sons back in the seventies.  I purchased the entire collection for my grandson and he is absolutely thrilled with it.  I was so happy that I found the collection still available on Amazon.  Thank you for making a 4 year old little boy as happy as his daddy was over 30 years ago.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I was raised in a fundamentalist christian church (the Church of Christ) and after age 21 I started the study of the world's religions because of the insanity of the church in which I was raised. Despite all my readings I never considered the aspects raised by Aslan; this was eye-opening. It is also an absorbing read.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is one of the best free games I have downloaded so far.  Some of the free downloads were very quickly deleted, but this one is a keeper.  Graphics are well done; puzzles are challenging (require thinking rather than just hand-eye coordination); ads to buy other things or parts have NOT popped up (so far); and bonus games can be unblocked with just a review (I do not use Facebook, find it highly over-rated).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is a fun and creative game with children that run away from the fat selector tries to get.
0061928356|5.0|Loved the book very moving and true to life with great description of India. We never really know what goes on in other countries
B00004RCKT|1.0|it was blocked for our region???????????so we could not watch it<br />asked for a replacement for this area but have not seen one...<br />returned the unseeable copy ..we were disappointed that we<br />could not watch it.
B0006B2A2E|5.0|This movie is great.  The music, the idea, everything is awesome.<br /><br />The music fits very well into the movie: it gives the feeling of spinning and dream-like reality.<br /><br />The idea (pre-Inception) was groundbreaking.  I think Inception was a copycat, with a much larger budget.<br /><br />Jim Carrey plays a very convincing serious role.  Kate Winslet plays an absolutely beautiful woman, who is a little crazy but very fun and realistic.  This movie will make you fall in love.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I got this kindle fire HD on Christmas day and the first app I got was this best app ever can't wait until the second one comes out!! God bless you all!!!!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Season 3 has several surprises, that left me in tears.<br />This show continues to get better with each season, I can't wait for season 4.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Would love to be able to delete.  I have to waste time going through previous posts. It is otherwise a lot of fun.
B009NH6JRE|5.0|what is there to say it's The Walking Dead that sums it up you can't go wrong with The Walking Dead
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I like playing this game when it works. But it's only like once or twice that it had worked. It just keeps flipping upside down on me all the time.
B008Y5UADK|1.0|I did not enjoy the movie, it was so boring, I stopped watching it within 30 minutes. I did not like the black and white picture, it was grainy and made the movie even more depressing.
B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|I saw Steve on Tavis Smiley's show and heard about the CD and the group (Kenny Wayne & Jerry Harrison). Played the CD at a small party I had. Everyone there loved it.
B006S01GH2|4.0|Audrey Tautou is a good actress. She shines above most other French actresses. Enjoyed the movie, it was very cute and I thought Audrey's acting made the movie very enjoyable.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|Sounds more like her album with Derek's band backing her up.  I kinda liked her stuff a tad mo better.
0547884591|5.0|Wow! This book is  a MUST HAVE easily! First of all, it's by Tim Ferriss!<br />Secondly, amazing content: applicable, smart, experience-based. Thirdly, great photos: some of them pretty graphic. I think it's pretty cool as a gift to anyone! Enjoy!
B00632HWOG|5.0|I really like the way the yahoo website is laid out. I love the way the mail is viewed!!!ya baby
0802473156|5.0|any couple who takes the time to read this book and put into practice the ideas contained in this book, will improve their relationship substantially.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|wonderful app filled with many challenging games the whole family. can play.. I have spent hours playing the games and plan on spending many more
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Large easy buttons. Nice display. Good switch over. Easy to recommend to my friends. I am constantly using this app.
B0000B1OFN|1.0|I was so excited, as soon as i receive and place in DVD player- NADA, put it in my laptop - ZIP, tried a portable dvd player -NOTHING.<br />RIp off because mailing back would be the same as cost as the movie
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Who can't love Christopher Plummer? The music is great. A touching, Wonderful story. Definition of a classic:A movie no home should be without.
B0044XV3R8|2.0|I got through Disc 1 but when I tried to put in Disc 2 it would not work - I emailed customer service and got no response... not a happy person...
0385484518|5.0|I bought this book because it was required for my nursing school theory class. Loved the book. Easy to read. Many great lessons in the book. Loved it! Shipping was fast. Book was used but in great condition.
1878424319|5.0|I love this book it is excellent reading and by far the best money spent! will be buying more soon!
B000OYC3J8|4.0|I first heard the song &#34;Icky Thump,&#34; on a German radio station.  I was listening in order to practice my language skills and heard this song.<br /><br />Although I was a bit jarred by the competing grooves in the song, I couldn't help but feel that someone captured a sort of Jimmy Page riff.  I nearly assumed it must be a classic rock band, but later found out it was the White Stripes. Beyond that, the way that song was mixed was incredible.  That bass drum is huge!<br /><br />Jack White has a gift for riffs and this album showcases several gems.  One of my favorites was in &#34;You don't know what love is...&#34; Great guitar solo in that as well.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|I enjoy snappy dialoge - this had it multitudes as well as a wonderful progression for the characters.  Highly recommend.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|Would have been great if it continued to work but after dealing with daily glitches it finally locked up for good. Wouldn't run at all for over two weeks. Finally deleated. Good bye all the time and money invested. Very dissapointing.
0316010669|4.0|Typical Malcolm Gladwell book.  Cool information presented in an enjoyable format that's easy to read. This is filler for the review
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a completely new take on the end of the world.  The characters are fully fleshed out, and the stories are so full of detail that you feel as if you live in the silo.
B006O5YHUY|4.0|This is a wonderful, gritty, fight movie with a great plot & a great message. It is not the standard, Hollywood product.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|This ua a great show I enjoyed it  and plan to watch it again in time  it's a must see
B0085A9J18|5.0|Most everyone who has seen this movie agrees the action and martial arts in The Raid is great. There's a lot of shooting (over the top, really) but that goes away very soon into the movie, and we are left with some inspiring fighting scenes. Granted, you had better like these kinds of movies or you'll be grossed out. Very realistic -- except (like the endless magazine of bullets) for the tireless energy of our fighters. These guys have really been eating their Wheaties or, more likely, their nasi lemak because they never tire out! From a more analytical point of view, The Raid is a joy to watch for the fighting techniques and choreography: the punches, kicks, sweeps and trips -- all part of the Southeast Asian martial arts of silat (somewhat related to Filipino eskrima).<br /><br />Some reviewers criticize The Raid for being long on action and short on story. Yes, but, there's enough story to drive the movie and stir the emotions. By the way, the guy you even end up rooting for may be the bad (&#34;maniac&#34;) guy. Small guy who believes in the purity of the fight.
B0073XW096|5.0|I give &#34;Brown Bear, Brown Bear&#34; to the parents of new borns.  It is a simple, natural language book that enhances interest, language, animals and much more.  Amazon's ability to connect with various outlets let me shop without entering the horrendous traffic in our area.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I loved the beginning but it failed to keep my attention till the end. And the ending- really???? Not bad, but didn't wow me.
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|This fast-paced thrilling movie with its funny and sarcastic vibe is one you'll want to watch again and again! Every time you watch it you'll see you something new!
B005JZBPHS|5.0|I love the L word series. It shows how lesbians have to face challenges daily. Yet, just because you are lesbians doesn't mean that you aren't like anyone else. ......a human being.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|We will watch this movie again and again! Such a fun ride! The casting director is ia genius the characters are amazing and the actors who play them as well.
1440503257|5.0|THIS BOOK IS AWESOME!!!  I absolutely recommend it to anyone who wants to learn how to whip up some of JK Rowling's most famous treats.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This is a great movie don't bother renting it just buy it! We loved the music and the characters we've already watched it five times. When you're feeling down this is the movie you curl up and watch. It'll put a smile on anyone's face!
B000FCKGPC|2.0|After the 3rd book ended so amazing I expected the 4th to take off fast. It definitely did not. The book is very slow until the last few chapters. Hope the next one is better.
B00F91SCXC|2.0|When choosing to watch a zombie apocalypse movie, it would be foolish to expect rich dialog and an intricate plot. In that sense, this movie offers no surprises.  The big disappointment is the movie's self-seriousness. If you can't have a few laughs while you're fighting off the zombie hoard, what's really the point?  Give me &#34;Shaun of the Dead&#34; any day.
B0039208CG|4.0|to me there will always be a Batman and a Dark Knight. Batman is fun and I enjoy the ideal of a super hero. Jesus is my favorite, but I grew up with superheroes and they are fun and encouraging.
B000002JSH|5.0|Considered the best effort put out by Bad Company as far as individual LPs. It had some great cuts such as &#34;Good Lovin' Gone Bad&#34;, &#34;Feel Like Makin' Love&#34; and &#34;Shooting Star&#34;, and Paul Rodgers and Mick Ralphs showed they were a great songwriting/playing duo. With Ray Burrell and Simon Kirke, they were one of the best bands around. Get this if you really like Bad Company. If you just enjoy there hits, get their greatest hits.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|I was openminded when I bought this book, but don't waste your money.  So repetitive it is boring boring boring!
B000002L99|5.0|This is the first effort without David Lee Roth. The true VH purist will not be happy. But to me, it shows that Eddie, Alex and Michael can work just as well with someone else as with David. They do a great job in focusing on the music, engineering, and production to put out a quality product that sounds really good to a rocker. Add this to your collection if, after listening to it, you like it. I did!
0064431789|5.0|Great Stuff to read to kids. I am reading it to unborn daughter . They said that is Good to read them while still are in the mothers belly. Also this book is part of the collection of childrens books that cannot be missed for any parent for their kids.
B000002UCN|5.0|It is the best of George Harrison, but not his individual songs. Half of the songs here are tunes he wrote when he was with the Beatles. In that case, too bad they didn't add &#34;Old Brown Shoe&#34; my favorite George song with the Beatles. But they are gems, because &#34;Something&#34;, &#34;Here Comes The Sun&#34;, &#34;Taxman&#34;, and &#34;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&#34; are true classics in any collection. My advice is if you have this, get &#34;George Harrison The Best of Dark Horse 1976-1989, and you will have all the best from George Harrison. I miss him.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|It is an interesting premiss, it was a good read but it lost some steam for me near the end.
1452110581|5.0|I do not know how much my friend enjoyed the book, but she did say she knew it was from me because it fit my personality.
0399226907|5.0|The book was in good condition like described and it came within the amount of time states when I ordered.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Quite simply - Magnificent  !  Anita expresses her experience exquisitely and clarity that we can all understand the simplicity and potency of our being. A huge blessing !!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|It feels like a profoundly honest and objective approach, depicting the geniality and the human flaws of this &#34;one-of-a-kind&#34; man that influenced computers technology very deeply. The book is written in no way judgefully but presenting the facts in a way that keeps you attached and fascinated.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Good story line that keeps you guessing.  In light of today world / politics it make you wonder.  There are times in each of our lives when we need to ask questions.
B000PMG16U|5.0|I'm a collector at heart, and every once in a while I view an entire series of films over a weekend.  Star Wars is one of those series.<br />But I never bothered getting 1 and 2 before.  Gave away my 3 and got this 1/2/3 BluRay set.  Definitely the reedited versions with the true George Lucas vision, lots more animals on Tatooine and better explosions.  It's one of those great stories that doesn't matter if you've seen it before because of the timings and details.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|Loved it.  Every song every time I play it !i have seen them live and this cd reminds me how great they are on stage!
B008I34ZFW|5.0|This movie kind of feels like &#34;Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow&#34;, tongue in cheek, lots of CG animation, feels like you're watching the future and the past at the same time so it doesn't feel dated as much, easy to watch over and over again.  One of a handful of movies that I see a little more each time I view it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This bok was easy to read and kept you in suspense. The characters really came to life so that you could easily picture them in your mind.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|People who loved the show have redone the music, enhanced all the colors, cleaned up all the little copying errors and degradation of old material, even snazzed up the warp engine inlets so they don't look like brown plastic anymore.  Finally caught about five shows I had missed in the original airings and reruns.  I finally recognize all the backdrops that show up in the credits at the end.  And I enjoyed the extra material that was added in, interviews, home movies, trade shows, the Christie's Auction.  Very pleased with the purchase, but it takes a while to work through about 10 disks per season and 3 seasons.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I have been using kik for a year on my kindle an  now I got an update and ha  to log back In an  my kindle said error try again in a bit  and it won't work fix this now all my friends on kik need to talk to me I might have to get another app this sucks please fix it now KIK IS TERRIBLE
B00005N5S5|4.0|Nowadays, older movies come packaged two at a time, that's how I got T3/T4, T2 came with Arnold's Total Recall.  Never could find a T1/T2 package except in VHS tape, yuchh.  This T1 copy was clean and looks crisp on a BluRay player and big LCD screen.  Best bang for the buck I could find on the Web.
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|Great graphics aside, they have created an excellently fun gaming gaming experience. It is not too hard to handle and the drifting is great!
B009MO57H6|4.0|Got the first four episodes as a set at WalMart for only $10.  Now I finally know there's room for at least one more after five.  We'll have to see.
B0001I561E|5.0|My daughter is in the play Aladdin and had not had the chance to see the entire movie.  My fear was finding it since it is not necessarily available in stores. Once I found it on Amazon, the company shipped it to me immediately and we received it a couple of days earlier than expected.  My daughter loved watching this movie and is excited to now own it!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|...to the trilogy.  Overall, I very much enjoyed it, even if I didn't find it as thoroughly engaging as the previous two books<br />of the series.  I felt it picked up after about the first quarter & then it was difficult to put down.  Don't want to reveal anything as there are a couple of major twists which I found to be satisfyingly appropriate.
1446249182|5.0|This book is mainly for using the SPSS. And the author passes the knowledge with a really funny tone. It's not boring as the traditional book.
B00BGV0Y26|5.0|Lizzy Hale. Need I say any more?? One of their best CD's to date. This band always records quality crafted rock with well written songs.
044661758X|4.0|This is a good, solid Harry Bosch novel. The book is a clever combination of a legal thriller, a police procedural and a whodoneit. The villain is a serial killer called the Dollmaker and, although the story is a bit on the grim side, ultimately the story has a lot to say about hope. This is one of the early Bosch novels, but Connelly has designed them so the reader can jump in at anytime. For my money, Connelly writes some of the best crime fiction around and this is a good example of his excellent work. I would highly recommend the book to anyone who enjoys modern crime novels.
0071373586|4.0|Positioning was a required reading at San Francisco State University when I was there and proved to be extremely valuable in starting my business. Sent the updated one to my business associate in the UK as a tool to use in our business there.
1936891026|5.0|Pressfield's compelling aphoristic style captured my attention.  He clearly articulates the inner struggle between indifference and focused effort.  This book is a winner in my opinion..
0393338827|5.0|Michael Lewis is easy to read because of the strong narrative he provides and his ability to tie stories together. Easy to forget it is non-fiction. And yeah, I learned what a MBS is, what a CDO is, what a credit default swap is, what it means to 'short' a stock or a bond, and what 'toxic assets' are.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This is my first Sparks novel and will not be my last. It is a good travel book, and keeps your attention throughout.
B000E1YW0E|5.0|Just what I wanted! I had owned this movie previously but had lost it while lending it out. I finally re purchased this movie and was very excited to be reunited. :)
B008Y212PI|5.0|A very relaxing game. Somewhat addictive. Haven't tried the difficult level yet. I'm enjoying solving the puzzles with relative ease. Beautiful graphics.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love to play this game.  May not be every day, but almost!  My grandchildren have also learned to play with me. They are 5 and 6 and it helps with their coordination..thanks so much
B003DNH6DK|5.0|I loved this movie. I watched this with my grandchildren and everyone agreed it was sweet, powerful and emotional. Bullock was at the top oif her game.
B008ALA6DW|4.0|It's quite a shame on apple's part that this adapter wasn't included with my mbp 15&#34; retina. For that, it loses a star.<br />My experience with Amazon with this order more than makes up for apples lack of support.  The adapter itself works fine and as advertised.  The speed is fast, build quality is above par.
B005SCSL56|5.0|I thought that it was an amazing book. I couldn't put it down and I loved it if I was in it....
0062073567|5.0|The Murder of Roger Ackroyd: A Hercule Poirot Mystery (Hercule Poirot Mysteries) is a brilliant detective novel and one filled with strange turns and surprise. Roger Ackroyd has been murdered and the police is stumped for an answer. In comes Mr. Poirot and slowly and methodically he reveals the murderer. This is a definite page turner and I was very surprised who was revealed to be the killer. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I play this game every day. I have been having problems numerous times when I try to buy more bingo tokens.
B001NEXEEG|5.0|Excellent, excellent film.  A must see for everyone.  I like a lot of John Wayne films, and really like Jimmy Stewart.  So, the two of them together with their charactered roles made this movie a timeless film.  John Ford directed almost every John Wayne film, this film included.  Great film.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun &amp;  Entertaining and I don't have to bog my friends down with requests or help me I need this, or send me this..... etc........<br /><br />Good mindless fun and dealing with life's ills.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|I don't know if this is a great book, but it is very interesting.  I read it after I read The Orphan Master's Son (which is AWWWWESOME!), and I think it would have been better if I read this first.  Escape tells the true story (or at least the author thinks so, the subject changed one important story in the book) of Shin Dong-hyuk who was born and raised in a labor camp in North Korea, but managed to escape.  Understanding that people are sent to labor camps for crimes of their relatives (three generations are punished for someone's crimes), and that they have children (when they get permission to have sex only, babies born as a result of non-authorized hook-ups are killed (along with their mothers)), live their lives, and die in the camps, is really hard to believe/understand, and yet it's true in North Korea. The few people who have lived in the camps and manage to escape to the west share difficulties adjusting to life outside of the camps, and that was also really interesting to read about.  I also learned about South Korea's programs to help people from the North.  This is a great read to learn about a really foreign concept and country.
B004I8WD7S|4.0|This case fits my 4s snugly and securely. Made of good, flexible plastic that won't stick to your picket like silicon. Feels solid without being bulky or overly rugged.
B00338QENI|5.0|This was a great book outlining early biomedical research and indicating some of the ways early scientist abused their power
B008YWY0HK|5.0|this was a great purchase! My little one watches it all the time and it's great! I would recommend it!

B00003CX8Y|5.0|This was my 2nd attempt to purchasing Beauty and the Beast online.  This was a great deal and the DVD was perfect.
B00CL151G4|5.0|Excellent show... What great chemistry between Jonny and Lucy. Jonny is great as Sherlock and Lucy is a good female Watson. I have always been a fan of Lucy. A pretty woman and a good actress. This is my first experience w/ Jonny and he is a good actor. Aidan Quinn and John Hill round out a solid cast, too.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Great book.  Good for working with people with Autism.  Really gives you and in site as to what is going on with them and how to make it better for everyone

B0078ZTWP4|2.0|I don't really care alot for this product because it has a battery indicator light that runs the battery down. Its bright with a good battery though.
B009NH6JRE|5.0|the only thing missing is the webisodes from last year, but other than that, it's most excellent!<br />I love when Michone runs about killing walkers too. That's the best.
B009NH6JRE|5.0|It's one of the best series shows  that has been on in a long time. A good collector item for sure.

B008IGP8QE|5.0|I just love it. All the songs are great. I`m so happy for my purchase, and I recommend it sure.
0385349947|1.0|I am still anxious to read this book. However, I ordered, returned, reordered and returned the book because of poorly put together pages. They text pages were either not cut evenly or not glued into the spine correctly. The pages were uneven and looked as if they would drop out of the book at any moment.
B0027MJU00|5.0|U got hooked on Gillian Flynn with Gone Girl so I had to read her prior novels.  I thoroughly enjoyed this one as well.
B00BPA2PEI|5.0|I'm not sure I can say that the picture  was better than the already great picture of its earlier release...(which may have to await  $K resolution monitors) but the picture and sound were very satisfying.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Great quality and received new. It was a great deal and I'm very satisfied with my purchase. Best movie also :)
0399165274|5.0|I liked it, as I liked all of Forsyth's books. Exciting and enjoyable.  A great read. I'll buy any Forsyth's books that come out.
B008MM9630|2.0|I loved the creative part of the game, but the need for gems which were hard to earn unless you purchase them.
B000ICXQGK|5.0|This is a great movie. Beautiful message and imagery through out the movie. Really sticks with you. Great for families
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|God damn it! Why do they make you write the review when you just finished! The book is lovely, changes your view of the world in a good way and has some very funny parts. Also has sad parts, but they're okay. Although, you should have some tissues, 'cause you'll need them. :)
0061906220|5.0|Fun to use with kindergarten class and a live musician to play along as they sing. The phrase &#34;Did Pete cry? Goodness no!&#34; comes up often in our class when remembering to not take little mistakes too seriously.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|My understanding of this product...plug into TV. Set up on iPad. Display what is on iPad on your tv. So far, it worked for Netflix... If my limited technology ability self would have known how and what this did or did not do. I would not have purchased.
B008Y212PI|3.0|Fairly good game. However, I am taking off two stars for forcing us to &quot;like&quot; the game on Facebook or post a review in order to play a bonus level. Not a smart move if they want a good review.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Great set for mystery fans.  Even knowing who did it doesn't ruin the fun.  And I never tire of hearing Peter Falk say &#34;Oh, just one more thing...&#34;  Hours and hours of good times.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|My decision to read World War Z was a classic \\"I loved the movie, so I'll pick up the book.\\" Max Brooks writes in quite a different manner than I expected. The novel is a different beast from the movie altogether, so you should approach it as such. It's a series of interviews regarding the Zombie Wars and how humanity fought back.<br /><br />The interviewer asks precisely the right questions to enable those who experienced various aspects of the Z War to tell their own side of the story in the best way possible. It shows how different cultures and people may react to the situation of a zombie reckoning. I found the novel incredibly interesting with a new take on zombies, which is hard to do nowadays with the excellent films and tv series [re: The Walking Dead]  abound.<br /><br />Worth a read for all you zombie lovers out there, like me!! An entertaining read with some exciting bits that'll make your heartbeat race!<br /><br />-Sarah<br />[...]
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Wow this book was better than the first book! I couldn't put it down! So unpredictable and surprised at every turn! I loved it!
1250012570|5.0|Gah! What a find! I wish novels like Eleanor & Park by Rainbow Rowell had existed when I was in high school... it would've been helpful and romance filled.<br /><br />This is the off-kilter psuedo-romantic adventures of two misfits. Eleanor is a redhead with an attitude who is just trying to appease her stepfather and reclaim her place in their home, while Park is a half-asian, 100% gothic, music-obsessed introvert working on making it through high school without attracting too much attention. Eleanor attracts ALL the unwarranted attention and at first, this is what Park abhors about her, but he soon comes to find that Eleanor's \\"issues\\" run deeper than those most teenagers face.<br /><br />The characters are completely lovable. At first I thought the story was going to be too surface, too top-level without any deeper meaning or personality... I was happy to find I was mistaken. Eleanor's rough edges are what I love most about her character... she doesn't say or do the right thing... EVER! And Park is so focused on his own views, he wants to help Eleanor, but can't seem to figure things out from her point of view. He thinks she wants the attention and fails to see that she is suffering under the pressures from rude fellow students and her disgusting stepfather.<br /><br />Excellent read. A fresh story, great characters, very endearing novel. Reminiscent of the things I love about John Green.<br /><br />-Sarah<br />[...]
B000HF702E|5.0|This was very good when I saw in on a broadcast TV station, but when you are able to watch it in your home, and it is viewed on a 55 inch TV it is far better than before.
1401938906|5.0|If you ever doubted your thoughts create your reality, you won't after you read this. Fun read and easy to understand. This should be a handbook for everyone.
B004EPYZZI|5.0|This movie should be seen by everyone who has lost a limb, or the use there of.  Although it is a heart breaker, It is also one of those movies that should be shown to everyone who has lost the use of one of more limbs and has given up on themselves and others.  I hope that places like the VA have copies of this in each and every facility.  Although this video is one that breaks our hearts is is also a very fine example of someone with a very strong will to live and a strong will to succeed.
B003E8AF5U|1.0|I couldn't even force myself to listen to the entire CD all the way through after buying it. I regret not listening to any of the tracks as previews, or at least looking a few up on youtube first. It is absolutely nothing like their first album.
0767817478|5.0|Now that I own the DVD I am able to watch it whenever I want to, and each viewing seems to make it just a little bit better!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I am not very good at reading and following instructions.  I am a show my type if person.  But this book was very helpful and easy.  It gave me literally, step by step instructions.  Walked me through every thing and even taught me how to do a table... Which I never knew before.
B000Q67876|5.0|What can I say about this classic movie except that it looks very sharp being in Blu-ray form. The book packaging that came with it gives you a lot of wonderful details about the characters.
B00AHDXTIK|5.0|Great price for length of cable. No longer do I need an extension cord to plug in my charger. I have used it almost every day for a few months now and I haven't had any problems with its function or cord wearing out.
0920236162|5.0|This is truly Classic Munsch.  I buy this book for new baby girls. I read it to my daughter over and over again when she was young. It is timeless!
B00992CF6W|5.0|hey every one if you are wondering what minecraft is then its stupid because its just a huge block the u build your stuff in so dont get it any more get a refund
B00E00GCF8|5.0|I just bought the CD and DVD and I think its sounded great in general, not as good as the Cow palace show from 1992 but what dya expact? this was 20 years later! It's still awesome to hear live version of Pyschotron, Captive honour and Arhitecture of aggression.<br /><br />Also, this is the first time Megadeth releasing a DVD without cutting the setlist! (Not counting Big 4 sofia). That one night, London 92, Rude awakening , Fillmore 99, Rust in peace live, all those DVDs doesnt have full setlist of the original show but this time it has the full setlist!
1451695195|3.0|This was purchased as a gift and I have had no feedback. The reviews are good but I have no personal knowledge.
1451626657|3.0|I wanted to read this becuase it's a classic it. And don't get me wrong it's a good book. But it's like watching M*A*S*H at the 4077.
B00D3LA5WG|4.0|The young boys in this movie were great little actors, not a bad movie for a Sunday afternoon, not the best movie I've seen but o.k..
1400034205|5.0|It's written very uniqely and I it funny and sad and interesting. The author did a good job of telling a story in a differway way.
B00915G6SU|5.0|I have been a fan of this show from the beginning, not to mention Shemar Moore isn't so bad to look at, the whole cast is amazing, and the plots are terrific!
B00E89VXQY|1.0|Metallica live is usually a decent experience, nothing compared to past years when James had his lion vocals and Metallica could write good songs.  These days they seem to be releasing a lot of live material which is ok but make the set list better, change it up and bit, please stay far away from lou reed and make some new music.  Hopefully they make something raw and actually good. I wasn't a fan of DM it sounded too much like the load/reload s***.
B008JFUO36|2.0|I didn't care for this movie, although my sister recommended it to me, and my husband liked it o.k., just different opinions from different people!
140006922X|5.0|An excelent history that attempts to tell the true history of Christ, the apostles, who wrote the Gospels and how the beliefs of Saul of Tarsus trumped those of James the Just.
B0058YPILY|5.0|I love this series, and love every episode I watch, can watch them over many times, so I wanted the DVD's for my collection.
B008Y212PI|5.0|FlipPix is great for the mind and addictive. I like that you can increase the number of boxes to increase the challenge and use the &quot;hints&quot; if you reach a road block.
B005OYKIJ0|5.0|Want muscly dudes who smirk a lot to chase each other through that one &#34;Favela&#34; level from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2?<br /><br />Shut up, of course you do.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Good acting, writing, plot lines... what's not to like? Appreciate the plots that are tied to current issues. This show works!
B008Y212PI|5.0|Fun and requires using your brain! Good way to spend some free time if you've nothing else to do. Some puzzles are easy to guess but some are perplexing as well
B003EVFHYG|5.0|John Powell might be my new favourite modern composer. I loved the film, and I love the soundtrack too. :)
B00985E3UG|5.0|This is well written, well researched and a fascinating read.  It certainly helped me change the way I look at all processed food.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I already have game consoles that can use streaming video apps, so that wasn't useful to me. However, Chromecast has proven itself to be the easiest way for me to connect the music I own from Google Music on my phone to my TV and stereo system. Instead of having to fiddle with plugs, buttons and leaving my phone on the stereo, I just use the app and can keep my phone on me.
147892506X|4.0|Excellent follow up to the first story. Mr. Colfet spins a tale that bobs and weaves across the Story Book land and continues to show that not everything is always good or bad. The characters we met in the first book are here again, with many given a chance to show growth.
B000007WOP|5.0|This album is a classic...it represents so much of the 90's for me. Every song is amazing. Thank you very much
0670024856|5.0|With all the flotsam and jetsam that floats by each day, it is heartening to read a book that engages, entertains and edifies one's view on life, all at the same time. Such is \\"The Signature of All Things\\" by Elizabeth Gilbert. As you might recall, she became famous for her memoir, \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" which sold 10 million copies, was made into a movie starring Julia Roberts and which has made her rich enough to begin rebuilding (including buying houses for friends) a small town in New Jersey where she lives with a husband whom she married to ensure he could stay in the U.S.A. on a green card. You might think that would be enough to handle in the past few years, along with setting up a shop of imported wares like Buddhas and other Asian things that her husband manages.<br /><br />But no, apparently, that's not been enough to occupy her time/life. With the publication of \\"The Signature of All Things,\\" Elizabeth Gilbert reveals that she has been busy researching 18th and 19th century botanical history, including the commerce of ocean trade between the West and obscure locations yielding up medicinal plants and potions that ebbed and flowed with plagues, fevers, malaria and other illnesses that could not be treated otherwise than with exotic potions and herbs. She has constructed a tale (that's the only word for it) of a family, and especially a heroine named Alma Whittaker who is not pretty but is very intelligent, feisty and hard-working who perseveres through a life of disappointments and wishes that go unfulfilled in unwinsome ways. That this story is told in a narrative fashion (\\"telling\\" rather than \\"showing\\" through dialogue) is a huge relief because stories matter and I'm so glad to be able to simply read for pleasure without having to deal with all the annoying current artificial fads in writing/publishing.<br /><br />That being said, another bonus in the writing is that for me, at least, the narrator's voice sounds awfully familiar to that of Jane Austen. In fact, I enjoyed reading this book much more than some Jane Austen's novels because the humor and wit come easy, comes often and is awe-inspiring in its light touch. So, it even kind of out-Austens Jane, but seems so effortless that it's not a contest, just fun.<br /><br />To be honest, I read a lot and am one of those readers who, unless engaged and interested, do not suffer books (or fools) gladly. This is the first book in a long time that I marveled at while laughing out loud. I also appreciated the more sobering discussions about the relationships of all things, (never mind the signature as explained in the novel,) and the spirited attitude of the heroine. I can't wait to read it again, more slowly this time, and savor the writing of someone who has already won the writing lottery with \\"Eat, Pray, Love,\\" a book that I wanted to throw across the room numerous times except for the \\"Pray\\" section. Now, against some odds, she has succeeded in writing literature. No wonder Elizabeth Gilbert is smiling in the photos that accompany the book. She's done what many of us want to accomplish in our lives: to be original in our creativity, to persevere until it is finished and to be published. I wish I had come up with something like this. But it's more than enough pleasure for me just to hold this volume in my hands and to know I can read it more than once and enjoy it more fully after an astonishing first time through. What a gift!
B007885IJU|5.0|What a great album. Such original material. I not talking about the songs they are certainly original. I mean the sound. Nothing sounded like this when it was released. Get it on vinyl, you won't be sorry
0439023521|1.0|very weak book.....about as much plot as a 1970s spatter movie....waste of money and time.....please dont waste your time<br />on this
B00BPXKWGS|4.0|Thank you R.E.M. for all the great music. I bought this on cd when it was new and loved it. So fortunate to have it on vinyl
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Excellent.  Simply excellent.  I avoided the series initially, because of all the hype, but these novels are exquisite in their attention to detail, their complexity and their grasp on your attention.  Salander is an unprecedented heroine who can intimidate as well as elicit passionate support from the pages of a book. Brava to Stieg Larsson for an amazing story line that keeps you riveted at first and then powerless to escape the story's grip in the last 100-200 pages!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Don't see what all the hype was about.  It took me forever to read and I did not find the story interesting at all.
B0000E6I1J|5.0|Heard the song online and ordered the cd on the spot....Like this version better than on Broadwalk Empire...Much longer and the artist who sings  the song is great.

B005LAII44|3.0|The Rock was okay and it might have helped to expand on Bruce Willis' character.  Decent but not a watch over and over movie
0920668364|5.0|Robert Munsch's story is timeless! The book can be read to a child, and delivers the message of security, love, and compassion. It belongs in every child's library and is a gift for new mothers and fathers as well.

B0017SWSCW|5.0|He is such a good story teller.  I was enthralled the whole time I was reading.  This was great and I have read the sequels also.  Can't wait for the next one because he truly leaves you wanting more at the end of the story.
0385743564|5.0|Steelheart is Brandon Sanderson's second foray into the young adult sci-fi/fantasy market, and is set in a world much like our own, with two major exceptions: all profanity has been replaced with new words (\\"Calamity\\", \\"slontze\\", \\"sparks\\") and superhumans known as Epics first came into existence 10 years ago. Unfortunately for the people of that world, Epics have been uniformly villainous and destructive. The narrator, David Charleston, has devoted his life to seeking revenge against the Epic who killed his father. Armed with a savant's knowledge of Epics and firearms, he seeks out the Reckoners, the only group of normal humans who present a serious threat to Epics.<br /><br />Because Steelheart is essentially set in the modern world, Sanderson doesn't need to spend as much time world-building as in many of his other novels, allowing the story to move much more organically. There are still times where the Reckoners or David need to explain something to each other, but they are relatively few and far-between. The principle of Chekhov's Gun is used to good effect, and even extraneous descriptions take on relevance as the story progresses. Finally, while Sanderson leaves room for sequels set in the same universe, Steelheart stands well on its own. It's long enough to tell a full story, and compelling enough that you'll want to read through it in a single sitting.<br /><br />A note of caution for readers at the younger end of \\"12 and up\\" - there are several scenes of violence, most of which are not described graphically. The most brutal is the first one during the Prologue, which is available as a preview if you have any concerns about the appropriateness for young readers.

B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|if you have a samsung galaxy prevail this game will not function on your phone. The good news is it can install to sd card and even after the massive 1gb download the game uses less than 2mb of phone storage...but thats meaningless if you cant play it.
0307408833|5.0|I have so far made only one recipe from this book, the carrot cupcakes. They were spectacular. As is stated in the book, follow the instructions exactly and I can't see why you shouldn't get great results every time. I enjoyed just reading this book as well as the beautiful food photography throughout. I believe it was a good purchase, I learned enough from reading the recipes and guidelines in the introduction that I feel confident adapting other recipes on my own to fit my dietary needs. I appreciated the authors explanation of why she chooses to use certain ingredients over others instead of expecting everyone to follow her in blind faith. I would recommend this book to anyone with gluten free, dairy free or even sugar free dietary restrictions. While not all the recipes will work for everyone, there is enough to please all camps I believe.
B008IGP8RI|5.0|This is a awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to the best songs on this soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then I recommend you do
B000XUBFE2|5.0|When I first started reading The Book Thief I wasn't sure what to expect. Who has death as the protagonist? But within a few pages I was caught up in Zusak's words and swept away. I love books and words and so this novel really hit home for me, and with the backdrop of WWII, how could you not be touched. This book made me cry and laugh, and when I was finished I was amazed at all the emotions that Zusak's had brought out of me. I highly recommend this book!
B005CGI3ZG|5.0|This product was in great shape and it was exactly what it was described as being.  Thanks to the seller, I was able to finally get the complete series of this show!
B0053TMP24|4.0|Pretty good book, can't wait to read the last one :) Percy Jackson books were better but these are a nice companion if you can't get enough of the series. Very complicated characters. The secret theme is big to this author.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|Wonderful stories with values well emulated and worthy of imitation. When I find it hardest to choose the highest standard I read stories like this and the weight seems to fly away and the hard choice becomes the dearest option.
B0000T6JGU|5.0|Let it be naked is an apparent effort for the band to release the album as different country version. Let It Be Naked has a much clearer sounds on songs like Across the Universe especially with the background noise, Paul's voice sounds a lot closer rather than been distant.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I love the fact that Mr King gave us an ending. I won't spoil anything here. My only suggestion is to read &#34;The Shining&#34; again before you start on &#34;Dr Sleep&#34;. I am glad I did. Through the years we are so bombarded with images from the movie version of &#34;The Shining&#34; we lose site of the story. At least I did.<br />I am reading all of Mr Kings books again because of &#34;Dr Sleep&#34;.  Somewhere along the way I &#34;grew up&#34; and forgot what a good story he writes!
B004CGCCFY|5.0|This album contains many of Stevie Wonder's biggest hits.  To find it on vinyl  in its original condition is just  fantastic. The lyrics booklet and bonus 45  were more than I expected.  Shipping was timely - this was a good experience .  Thanks!

B00AYB1TP0|5.0|As reading is the skill that leads to learning most other content and skills, we spend a lot of time teaching our children about letters, sounds, and words. Young children can benefit greatly and prepare for the future by learning about letters and their associations with words. The best type of learning for very young children is conducted through play, as that is how they discover the world. Apps like 'ABC Alphabet Aquarium School' are ideal for this purpose.<br /><br />The app's producer, 22Learn, makes a variety of learning apps for kids. Many of these deal specifically with phonics, letters, and other concepts that help children develop reading skills as they play. I use their apps often with my students (I work as a teacher/tutor) and they are generally well-received. I love their apps because they are backed by educational professionals, research, and methods real teachers use in schools everyday. These apps make it easy and fun to learn- providing the added value of entertainment and keeping kids busy- so children can get a 'head start' and build the vital skills they need to succeed in school.<br /><br />This app is great for beginning learners because it goes through each letter individually. This allows children to learn them one at a time and move on when they have mastered the previous letter. Each letter of the alphabet includes four activities- a letter puzzle, a puzzle that associates the letter with a word that contains the letter as its initial sound,  a drag and drop activity with more initial-sound associations, and, finally, a matching/shape recognition activity using the letter and even more word associations. By presenting the letter, saying it aloud (the app contains spectacular professional voice acting!), and showing how it is used in words, the app builds connections in the player's brain, creating a lasting impression of the concept that they can build off of.<br /><br />Once one letter is mastered, the next letter appears with the four activities customized to that letter. The first activity- the letter puzzle- helps build recognition of the letter and is especially useful to tactile learners as they 'build' the shape by selecting pieces. Children will especially love the next activity which involves building animals with names that begin with the letter they are studying! It is a very unique and cute activity. The last two activities are drag-and-drop puzzles which are friendly for young hands (it does not have to be 'perfect' to snap into place for a correct answer- none of my young students have had an issue with that), and learners can only benefit from hearing more words and examples. Tapping a letter prompts an upbeat voice to pronounce the word, which is fantastic!<br /><br />During this seaside adventure, encouraging voices and entertaining, child-friendly characters provide motivation through professional voice acting and illustrations. The app has a seaside theme kids are sure to enjoy, and the bright colors are inviting and keep kids entertained for hours. Professional voices pronounce the letters accurately, so there is no worry about children learning incorrect sounds. A comprehensive settings menu allows for turning off certain activities, sound, and music, as well as erasing game progress.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Superb story line and expertly acted.  Can't wait for next season. Multiple story lines going on at the same time. Period piece but with lessons for today. Can relate to characters.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|Nice Lego set, very easy to set up, very happy w the purchase, hope to see more Lego sets like this one.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|Dude...you have to have this movie in your collection. There are so many life lessons to learn from the Dude. John Goodman damn near steals the show for his WAY over the top Viet Nam Veteran bowling buddy. John Tuturro will make you laugh out loud as the competitor bowler and Sam Elliot, in full cowboy regalia,  just popping in and commenting is only small bits of the whole story. The nihilist ex German group Autobahn...Bunny, Julian Moore zip lining in nude to deliver a load of paint to her painting... there is so much going on but always remember, it's all about the rug man...&#34;it really tied the room together...&#34; Get it, become enlightened.
B00CWGLOY6|4.0|This was a very good start to which I anticipate to be an incredible series. I liked Vol 1 very much and Vol 2 is even better!
B0018O4YT0|5.0|I've had several versions of this movie, from VHS to earlier DVDs. All had terrible audio and just didn't make much sense, being chopped and wrecked by &#34;the suits&#34; that wanted it their way. But this version is PERFECT!. You can understand all the dialog, the music and background sounds balanced and best of all, the story makes perfect sense now. All lost scenes are back, Jennifer Connelly does her own singing (a negative to some but a plus for me...makes her seem more real as the club singer) so I have to say GET THIS VERSION!!!
B0000060NH|4.0|This album is more instrumental. It's great!  There were a lot of effort put into this album.  Because it's one of Marvin Gaye's favorite theme song I like it for that reason.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|If you like &#34;Elysium&#34;, you'll appreciate this. Same horrible separation of the classes and the means for the privileged to maintain control. This version of this movie is by far worth having in the Blu-Ray disk. This is just such a good story and for fun, go to You Tube, and find the original test footage &#34; Alive in Joburg&#34;  to see how far they took it. I sorta miss the mech suit in the test footage. But an EXCELLENT movie. I REALLY hope that Jackson plans a sequel to this masterpiece.
B002RI9ZQ8|2.0|The underlying story is good, but much of this book is padding, put there solely to separate the beginning from the end.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I love this show and the music simply makes me feel good.  I play this at my computer and in my truck a lot and can't wait for more to come in the future!
B00CFYD682|5.0|Alison is just as good as ever.  Her voice is strong and clear, all the songs are just what you would expect from the good songwriter that she is.  This CD was worth waiting for.  I have it in my car and cannot stop listening to it.  Going to see her in LA in Nov. and can't wait to hear them live.
B000RLFJQ2|4.0|Closed captions are at least 2-3 seconds delay. Hit or miss with Amazon's movies with CC as of late. Not a happy purchase in my opinion.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works perfectly and easily. I just wish more apps would take advantage of it. The app on the top of my personal list isn't Pandora, its Plex.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|Good as a mantra to set you on a straight path when you have fallen off the good path of life.
B003ODHOA4|5.0|Well, you can't title it \\"Practical Dirty Chinese\\" but it'd be a better description. I've been a student of Mandarin Chinese for 15 years since I married a wonderful Chinese lady and adopted her two terrific children. I never thought of myself ever learning such a \\"difficult\\" language but I am. Rosetta Stone and all the other \\"immersion\\" language studies are good and valuable but they're nothing like \\"D!RTY Chinese\\" that give an insight unavailable anywhere else short of talking to real Chinese people who posses the vast knowledge in this fun to read book!  Dirty is just a come-on and yes it tells the truth about Chinese culture I don't think you can get anywhere else. My wife and kids (all college graduates) found it a scream and they keep saying \\"yeah, that so TRUE!!\\" I have the book conveniently on my Kindle reading every chance I get in my busy life. The book is easily understood, with helpful pronunciation guides (Pinyin)and very funny explanations in the current vernacular. Even if you don't plan to learn Chinese but have a mild interest in their culture you'll truly enjoy this book for its entertainment (and true!) value alone. Well researched and presented \\"D!rty Chinese\\" is as informative and grossly entertaining as they come! Thanks for adding real spark to my Chinese studies! LOL
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|My daughter re read this trilogy 3 times already and she will probably do it again after her Hunger games bday party
B007N579X6|5.0|Yes I'm a adult and this just really touches that child in us all. I think this movie is awesome, great fantastic and whattttttt love it. Can't wait for the 2nd one to come out to add to my Despicable collection. Saw it in imax theater, now I gotta have it so I can watch it 20 million more times.
B003NX76BM|5.0|Nora Roberts is one of my favorite authors.  It was easy to load to my kindle.  I will be purchasing more books.
B004UOE7VA|5.0|Yah, I was shocked to find a sanctioned remix collection like this......wow!, a move on the right direction for Disney! Now, Give me the next movie soon, please!, please........
B00594XOZU|1.0|Alllll my friends use kik on their phones, so im guessing this is just a kindle thing? But it's not working. Common kik step up yo GAMEEE
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This is an awesome book and I love it. Everyone should get this book. It is not appropriate for kids though
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Makes me think more and I like how the fish don't die because if they did you could have a really rare fish and it died.
160386556X|4.0|Not exactly what I thought it would be but interesting enough to finish it although it took awhile to get through it.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|could have used more action<br />felt too short<br />why isnt there a scifi series like lord of the rings<br />smart
B005HJWWW8|4.0|For a weak source, this thing can work wonders. But it's not without flaws.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Light.<br />Cheap.<br />Works really well.<br />Multiple EQ, with color coded indicator.<br />Controls easy to work with in dark.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Bit flimsy.<br />Mini USB port (I don't understand Fiio's love for this extinct port!).<br />No auto sleep.<br />Included cable will not last long. Fiio's own L8 should be included by default.<br />Very susceptible to external interference.<br /><br />Some of the cons I have listed should be expected of an amp this cheap, so my rating remains 4 star. But anyone buying this should be aware of the issues.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Bruce Willis never disappoints and this movie is very entertaining.  My husband watched it several times!  Great movie so go watch it!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Pretty good story.. I liked the way it was written and how everything was described. My only question is if these flower meanings at the end are actually true..! The main character is a bit too whiny at the end, but overall pretty good book!
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|I saw a program on GAC explaining the development and music on this record.  It was exactly what I expected.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Love political themes.  This is one of the best.  Who needs network television. Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright are terrific
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Love being able to watch the last season to get ready for the new season. arrived on time and in good condition.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This is an intriguing story set in Ireland and told from a completely \\"Irish\\"  voice.  A story of human redemption and love.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Unlike the other review I read, I did not guess the Husband's Secret.  The entire time I wondered how it was going to play out so I couldn't put it down.  Loved it and in the end I was still thinking about how everything worked out!  Highly recommend!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|To finally know what happened to the survivors of The Shining. Wonderful character development - King hallmark. Thanks, Mr. King.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|i love this game! it is challenging and hard to put down!  love these types of games and puzzles! my daughter has fun trying to solve!
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|This movie was very fictional of course, but it was interesting. I've never seen a zombie in love with one of the living. And have that love turn it back into a human. Again...interesting.
B00915G6MG|5.0|This program is rated # 1 in my book.  I have watched  NCIS since JAG'S was  it's  parent show. The actors are the best, they have staying power, meaning  when they are gone you still consider them vital assets to the show .  I will continue to buy upcoming seasons of NCIS !
B00062PN6I|5.0|I got one for myself and liked it so much I got my wife one as well.  The cord is more than sufficient, the sound quality is great for everyday use.  The adjustment system is a little on the cheap side but it is comfortable.  If you're an audiophile you may prefer $100 headphones but I can barely tell a difference between these and a pair of Beats I borrowed.  I'd rather go with the affordable option.

B005MYEQ4U|5.0|GREAT MOVIE GREAT CONDITION GREAT SERVICE. NOT MUCH MORE TO SAY SO I WILL TYPE TO MAKE THE COMPUTER HAPPY
B004XZ99LO|4.0|The acrobatics were nice, and this was less costly as actually attending the show; however,  it seemed like just that. No &#34;story&#34; to it so almost felt like performers were &#34;doing their thing&#34;. We did enjoy this 3D DVD and were very glad the cost of owning this one, didn't have the usual hefty price tag of attending the show!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|GREAT MOVIE GREAT CONDITION GREAT SERVICE .NOT MUCH MORE TO SAY SO I WILL TYPE TO MAKE THE COMPUTER HAPPY
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|We watched this DVD second, as it it was longer. FABULOUS!! The &#34;story&#34; caught on part, thru' the 3D-Blu-Ray film; color was gorgeous, no chance of missing anything as I felt I was sitting in the front row, the acrobatics were excellent, costumes very colorful. We enjoyed the music of yesterday from some of the Beatles BIG songs. Recommend this to everyone, including children who might not &#34;get&#34; the story but they'll enjoy the acrobatics and the &#34;light&#34; music.
B002RSDW80|5.0|GREAT MOVIE GREAT CONDITION GREAT SERVICE.  AGAIN NOT MUCH MORE TO SAY BUT I TYPE TO MAKE THE COMPUTER HAPPY.
0385523394|5.0|I'm not usually interested in autobiographies, but having worked in the prison system (not hired by TPS, but contracted via the local County Health Department to perform HIV testing, confidentially, of inmates who volunteer to have a test), this book Piper wrote is so exciting and realistic. I've seen some of the behaviors Mz. Kerman wrote about, which can be intimidating as I felt vulnerable, despite a correctional guard being seated right outside the the closed door. Rather than the usual I heard (&#34;Don't know WHY I'm in here... I AM innocent!&#34;), Mz. Kerman tells her story in an intriguing way so you don't loose sight of the real happenings. EXCELLENT, easy read; however, due to her University degree, she can and does use some words (I am an RN) I had to Google to understand the concept. Decidedly a terrific book for the over 17 crowd. If I were on a school board, I would also recommend this book on the &#34;required&#34; reading list. It might be enough of a deterrent for students to think twice about some of their choices!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Too many times I'd heard about this movie and how great it is, but for some reason I didn't see it until recently when it was on TV.  I ordered it because once I had seen it I wanted to be able to put it on any time I want!  Every scene is hilarious, the cast is perfect and it's short enough to keep my attention.  This is quickly becoming a classic for our time, with so many great one-liners.  One viewing will hook you!
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|C f Goff f fcgcgcgcfcgcgcgcgcg Goff google is not a good cop game about truck series of ages wanted dead and
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Really enjoyed the twists and turns of this novel. There were some things I did not see coming until they were there. Well done, Mr. King, well done.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I'd see anything Maggie Smith is in, but the ensamble of those wonderful actors is beyond words.  So well written script and performances that the movie can't go wrong. Absolutely a must have.
B00DXP0QV2|5.0|if you're a real Nirvana fan you know you don't have to spend this kind<br />of money when you can buy the deluxe edition and the live and loud DVD for 40 bucks.<br />BUT,the audio for this show will burn your speakers for months.<br />and the packaging is super nice.<br />for me,I will be playing it so much it's worth it.
B00364K6YW|5.0|The best of the genre of Made for TV Austin...and better in my opinion than the full-length movie versions.  Well worth the hours on the couch at home!
B001XUPGLY|5.0|Great movie, remember watching it the first time with my GF. We were living in SF at the time and then went out after to all the local places they showed.
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|I love this game and wish more of my friends played it so we could race each other. Other free games suck. This one is great. I'm surprised it is free.

B009UNH0EM|5.0|Bought my Plantronics Blue Tooth at Verizon but they do not sell any accessories and I was in need of a more portable charger option so bought the 2 Port USB Car Cigarette Lighter Adaptor to plug this into and it works perfectly to charge my Blue Tooth away from home and a 110 plug in capability. Much more effective than the clam shell Plantronics offers for car charge option and much cheaper. I have one in each of my vehicles so have availability for under $5 as opposed to the Plantronics $35+ USB clamshell for vehicle use. Quality adaptor cable at a great price.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|My daughter gave me the DVD package for Season 1 and 2 and I was hooked. The purchase of Season 3 was a gift to myself and I like to be able to watch it whenever I want. Another plus was that it came with the capability of watching on other devices.

1442419814|5.0|awesome series! i already read all four books it was really good<br />i liked the idea of everyone being pretty at 16 and how the story developed<br />tally is a great and brave character
0743270754|5.0|Best US Historian of our times, this book deserved the Pulizer.  Kearns Goodwin has done a meticulous piece of research and yet has managed to tell everyone story to sufficient depth and detail, you can easily imagine yourself as part of the &#34;team&#34;. Brilliant book, I have read it three or four times.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Loved the first book; the second was okay, but this third book seemed forced. It didn't keep my attention like the other two did and all I kept thinking as I read it was &#34;will this never end?&#34;
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|I love this series and re-read it often.  David Weber is a great writer and his books have the authentic feel.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I love the imagery in these books. The author takes great care to describe scenes and I picture the scenes more vividly than what was depicted in the movie (which I saw after reading the entire series). What struck me most in the second book was how political it was, especially because it's geared towards young teens. Overall, good read but you won't be blown away.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Amazing!!! Can't wait to watch the next seasons! HD makes such a big difference. Its Definately worth the extra money.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game!!  Every level challenges the mind in how to flow the pipes.  It's like a work out for the mind
B00BWWS81S|4.0|When I initially listened to the tracks on this CD I initially disliked them because it wasn't the KT I was used to. More moody and quiet. No rocking anthems or pop hits. But after a few listens I heard some great tunes. Throttled back, great music. Not something I'd listen to get fired up for a game, but songs to listen to and sink into my bones. That's not meant to be a left handed compliment. The songs are great, but they're not what you're used to if you're a KT fan. It's like discovering a whole new artist.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|Easy listening, soothing music.  I love it.  His voice is so relaxing, great CD.  It is now one of my favorites.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is exactly what I was looking for. Daily<br />and hourly temperatures as well as radar. A very well done app.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|The DVD was good HD quality, sound was outstanding.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  I will continue to invest in the Star Trek DVDs.
B009NFHF0Q|1.0|This was a bad choice. It was on the best seller list for a long time.  I usually choose my books from that.  This was the dumbest story I ever read. I always finish reading my books just in case it gets better at the end but this one didn't. I don't recommend this book.
B0015XHQTE|5.0|Perfect item for the &#34;Dirty Harry&#34; fan...Great bonus items and packaging makes it a definite upgrade from the old VHS tapes.
B009F879HK|5.0|This is a nice nostalgic return to the first British release of the Beatles initial single release on their own.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|great story. well-made movie. excellent filming and acting. watched with my teen son. we both were thrilled and touched by the movie.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|I held off on watching this for a long time because I expected cheap laughs and cheesy music. I will admit that I was *mostly* wrong. Some of the music was really catchy and the plot was predictable, but well written. I will say that I am so over Rebel Wilson's schtick of &#34;the fat girl takes of clothing&#34; being the funniest thing in the world. It's not. I am really coming to love Anna Kendrick as an actress, though. If you're looking for something fun to watch on a lazy afternoon, then this is perfect. It's not a must see 100 times in my book, though.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|Totally awesome way to kill hours of time.  If you try going for really off-the -wall characters you'll be amazed when it gets them.  On the other hand, It can be beat so that does make it a bit of a challenge.
B003ZHQVJO|5.0|I love Kid Rock, and I love this CD. I pop it in my CD player in my car, and sing along with him and it gives me a jump start on my otherwise boring day at work. He is one of the very best rockers in my eyes, and this CD is probably his best ever!
B009IN3AOS|4.0|Enjoyable upbeat music.  Brilliant mix of beat, melody, and the human voice the only pure, personalized instrument.  Vocals more rare than the Stratavarious.  Never to be duplicated again.  Ella is pure passion and grit.  Love it!!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Limited functionality. Only works for 2 apps (YouTube and Netflix) which are standard on nearly every new Bluray player.<br /><br />Was hoping for much more including broadcasting personal videos to TV, HBO Go, Flixter and basically whatever my iPhone can play.  My bad...bad buy.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I could use several great adjectives to describe this movie.  Outstanding seems to work best right along with funny.  Loved this movie.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I love 21. The music is great.  I'm going to copy it to my mac so I can sync it to my phone.
B008NW67E0|4.0|Great to hear good music again! The style is tremendous with great lyrics. This will be enjoyable for a long time.
B00DJ80VLS|4.0|I first heard Pull Me Under in 1993 at a friends house and my life changed after that moment. I listened to Images and Words over and over again until I could hear it in my sleep. I never heard music like that. So I am a 20 year fan. It pains me to write this review. When Portnoy left the band I was very upset, and wondered if the band would go on without him. Once Mike Mangini became the new drummer I waited with anticipation to hear A Dramatic turn of events. I was blown away. I thought it was their best since Six degrees. I've now listened to the new self titled album at least 15 times and I have to say I am disappointed. To me this is one of their least memorable albums since Falling into infinity. None of the songs are bad, but none are amazing either save maybe for Illumination Theory. One thing that stands out to me is a lack of heavy grooves ala Glass Prison\\" Bridges In the sky\\" \\"The Mirror\\" etc. One of the things I've always loved about DT is that they were Progressive METAL. But the new album is much closer to progressive rock. I cannot even put my finger on exactly what it is suffice to say this album does not excite me or move me like previous albums. It just lacks intensity I guess.<br /><br />Track breakdown<br /><br />1. False Awakening: This one is short, clocking in at less than three minutes. It's a pretty good intro, but it sounds like many other DT songs compressed into one. 6/10<br /><br />2. The Enemy Inside: This was the first song everyone heard off the album and while it's \\"heavy\\" it's just not that intense. It's just sort of meh. I was way more impressed the first time I heard On The backs Of Angels from the last album. 7/10<br /><br />3. The Looking Glass\\" Rush anyone? This tune is great and the lyrics are very relevant but, it sounds like DT and Rush had a kid. 7/10<br /><br />4. Enigma Machine: Ahh the instrumental. Pretty solid. The ending is epic. It sounds so huge. One of the better tracks on the album. 8/10<br /><br />5. The Bigger Picture: Man everybody loves this one but me. It's good, don't get me wrong. But it never really goes anywhere that interesting. It sort of builds at times but never seems to get off the ground. At times it's even a little boring. 6/10<br /><br />6. Behind the Veil: Has some decent riffs and vocals but still lacks punch. It just seems to meander a bit. 6/10<br /><br />7. Surrender To Reason. Another very Rush inspired song with John Myungs awesome lyrics. This is a very strong tune. 8/10<br /><br />8. Along For The Ride: Someone needs to Tell Jordan that the next anthem/ballad DT does he's not allowed to use the Moog. Not a bad song however. 7/10<br /><br />9. Illumination Theory: Without a doubt the best track IMO. Runs a little long at parts but it's intense. The return in the middle has James LaBrie in top form. He's seriously on fire here. Great song. 9/10<br /><br />Since people like to do this, here's my list of DT albums ranked favorite to least favorite.<br /><br />1. Images And Words<br /><br />2. Awake<br /><br />3. Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence<br /><br />4. Scenes From A Memory<br /><br />5. A Dramatic Turn Of Events<br /><br />6. Octavarium<br /><br />7. Systematic Chaos<br /><br />8. Black Clouds & Silver Linings<br /><br />9. Train Of Thought. (Yes I like this more than the self titled album. Sue me.)<br /><br />10. Dream Theater<br /><br />11. When Dream And Day Unite<br /><br />12. Falling Into Infinity<br /><br />UPDATE 10/23/13. I cannot believe all the rave reviews for this album. I've since listened to it a dozen more times and it has not gotten better. More to the point. I just finished listening to Six Degrees, Scenes, Black Clouds, and Dramatic turn. This new album PALES in comparison. It lacks all the edge and honesty of those albums. I do like Mangini, but I have to confess in missing what Portnoy brought to the table.

B001F7EZ9Y|2.0|Life-long AC/DC fan here, I've been listening to them for years and have all their albums.<br /><br />I've tried to like Black Ice, but I just can't get there.  The band initially released this album as a Wal-Mart exclusive, and I think they changed their sound to appeal to that audience.  AC/DC has always been straightforward hard-rock, but this album seems dumbed-down with a twang that ends up sounding more like ZZ Top than AC/DC.<br /><br />You read a lot of interviews with the band and they make a point about how the bass and drums are super simple to get out of the way of the guitars and vocals.  But there has always been a solid crushing beat to AC/DC's music.  On this album, the bass and drums just seem dialed-in.  Listen to the drums in Rock 'n Roll Train, the \\"best\\" song on the album.  They are downright geriatric, the beat is so super-simplified that it's boring and uninspiring.  You can't rock out to it.<br /><br />They also did some experimenting with their sound.  One song features Angus on a slide guitar.  A lot of people are cheering this on, but to me it has a redneck sound to it.  It's not \\"AC/DC\\".  They even did a ballad on the album.  Now this is a band that survived the death of heavy metal because they refused to do a ballad.  So why now?<br /><br />I know I'm knocking this album pretty hard, but don't take my word for it.  Listen to the \\"best\\" tracks on this album.  Then compare them to Thunderstruck, Back in Black, Highway to Hell, Whole Lotta Rosie, Heatseeker, Let There Be Rock, TNT, Riff Raff, even some newer stuff like Hail Caesar or Stiff Upper Lip.  Black Ice ends up being 15 tracks that sound like they're performed by a mediocre AC/DC cover band.<br /><br />I will say a couple positive things about the album.  The sound quality is great.  And Brian Johnson's voice sounds *fantastic*.  I don't know if he got surgery or if they're using some kind of computer effects, but his voice sounds almost as good as it did on Back in Black.  Too badhe decided to \\"go lite\\" this time  - he spends more time crooning on this album than belting it out like he used to.<br /><br />Overall, this album is just one step above Fly on the Wall (which has no redeeming qualities at all).  I don't like the countrified \\"AC/DC lite\\" sound they went with this time.  For their next album, they need to remember what made AC/DC \\"AC/DC\\".  Hint: It wasn't slide guitar, it wasn't ballads...and it wasn't Wal-Mart.  It was solid hard rock that you could count on every single time.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I am not a huge fan of 3D, but this is one movie I really like in this format.  I have seen it in both formats and I prefer the 3D.  I recently acquired a 3D television so this was the first blu-ray I bought for it.  I'd recommend it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Best device ever! I basically have one attached to every single TV in the house now. It's great for watching YouTube, and I can play/pause from either from phone or computer. It's also great for showing presentations as I can cast my tabs right from Chrome from my macbook pro. I have a retina macbook pro and it works great.
B00CP4RZCU|1.0|This is worse than the diarrhea Eddie Vedder sprays into a microphone every time he sings.  Ugh. Somehow this album got on my list of things I might want to purchase. Please, no!
B0043JDUNS|4.0|Robert Downey Jr. is hysterical!  The special affects are amazing, love the action and explosions. Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockwell were the great bad guys.  AC/DC was absolutely perfect for soundtrack.  Another great movie.... Great job, John!
B004X80QNG|4.0|This application is handy as a pocket reminder.  You can set it up to open to a &#34;today's events and to-do list&#34; page so you immediately see what's 'on for today' as you open the app.  It also has daily-weekly-monthly calendar views.
B001KZG99A|5.0|Robert, we love you!  This was a great introduction to Iron Man and how the character came about.  Jeff, The Duuuuuude, you are really scary when you aren't bowling.
B0081JPTCQ|3.0|I look for apps which are very simple to use and completely uncomplicated. I tried this app and found that it did not fit my needs. For me, there are other apps were better-suited to what I wanted to use this for.  Perhaps others will have better success in using this app efficiently.
B004XVN1T4|3.0|It's not a bad book, but Ken Follett has written so much better.  I am a great fan of Ken Follett, but this one just didn't seem to quite come up to standard.  However, if you are a follower of spy novels, with double-agents and international espionage, it's a good one to pack in your holiday bag or to read on the plane.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|I enjoyed the movie but the ending was somewhat dissapointing as it didn't completely close out the characters. It was still entertaining for a plane ride.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This book gives great insight into the workings of humanity. It gives great suggestions as to how to deal with some of the things that go in life.
0307744434|5.0|this will keep you scratching your head. Very intriguing. I enjoyed it. The book is really beautiful too, a treat these days when publishers want to save money.
B00006I53S|5.0|I was looking for a good &#34;Walking around&#34; lens. This definitely fits the bill. Most of my walking around is done in daylight, combined with the fantastic ISO settings available on DSLRs nowadays, this is about as good as it gets. Combined with my other choice of the Sigma 28-300mm f/3.5-6.3 DG IF Macro Aspherical Lens for Canon SLR Cameras I am all set! I have other large heavy glass which I still use, but when I go for a walk in the hills with my wife, these guys save it from turning into an expedition.
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|The only thing better in regards to experiencing the MDNA tour via Blu-ray was seeing it in person. The cool thing about watching it on disc is that there are such an array of angles and filming formats used to bring this show to the screen. Super cool!
B008Y212PI|2.0|This app force closes after each puzzle. As a result no progress is being saved. Would give it 5 stars if I could atually play it.
B00E3D7WGU|5.0|This is the first of her concert cds to include all of the songs played during her show, which is pretty cool.
0525478817|5.0|It was wonderful as always! I love John Green as well as amazon! I would of course, always use amazon again.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I was lead to this book by it's comparisons to Grossman's \\"The Magicians\\" and Barker-Croy's \\"The Thinking Woman's Guide to Real Magic.\\" The comparison was apt, particularly with regards to Barker Croy's book, though I'd say plotwise this book has more tropes in common with traditional supernatural books. A really enjoyable read! I can't wait to find out what happens next.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|All I needed is a simple straight forward calculator.  This is perfect.  Big keys simple to use..  if you need a calculator then this is for you..  and it's free.
B009RX7WTI|5.0|Love Grey's Anatomy own every Season.......Plus always watch the reruns on T.V.  Best Show Ever.  Hope it shows for another 10 seasons....
B000Q6GX5Y|3.0|If one rates this as a comparison to Frank Miller's graphic novel by the same name then the director/producer did a pretty good job.  As for historical accuracy, well, not so much.  I wish they would make a movie version of \\"Gates of Fire\\" by Steven Pressfield.  That would be a good movie.
B00008EY9G|4.0|A great tight mystery with a &#34;surprise&#34; ending. Some will enjoy the twist & turns, whilst others may roll their eyes. I had fun watching it. Having it all unfold. What's better is watching it the second time around with the knowledge of the finale. Great performances. So truly horrific cringe-worthy moments. A nice evening of mystery and terror.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|One of my family's favorite films.  Even when we can't agree of what to eat for diner there is never an argument over watching Serenity.  Good film, great story, and lovable characters.
B000IJ79WU|3.0|I've had the pleasure of meeting Donner. A really energetic, fun, buoyant person with a big personality. It's impossible NOT to like him. So I finally got to see his vision of what Superman 2 may have been. The experiment is really great, but I think a LOT of it falls short. Simply because he was never given a chance to fine tune the outcome. So as a stand alone movie, this is close to unbearable. Bad, unfinished effects. A lackluster score. Inexplicable plot holes. Slugs of material that clearly didn't fit the cut. In defense of Donner...it was to get fanboys to get off his back. SO this slapdash effort feels...forced.<br /><br />It did make me really frustrated with what-could've-been had Donner been given time back in the day. I feel his vision of part II would've been filmed nicely. And we'd never have a clue of the alternate theatrical release. As it stands, it is what it is.
B004XKVPG6|4.0|Watched this movie while I was downrange.  The subject never really interested me but I like Morgan Freeman as a actor so I thought I would give it a chance.  I wasn't disappointed.  I wouldn't rush out to watch it again but if I were in the mood and there wasn't anything else on I'd watch it again.
B00FEHXISA|5.0|This movie was almost as good as Iron Man 1.  Good story line and kept your attention throughout. Good for most ages.
B00C2IJJE6|5.0|About the only complaint I have about the movie is I didn't see Tim Robbins playing the role of Andy Dufresne I had envisioned someone more on the lines of the \\"inconceivable\\" guy for Princess Bride (Wallace Shawn).  Tim Robbins, although a good actor (and he pulled the role off...just not my vision), just doesn't have that accountant look to him.  Would watch the film any time.
B0000TAZBK|5.0|What can I say?Simply Great!!! the best music ever; I recommend it even if you're not  a fan of the films.
B001992NUQ|4.0|I thought this film was rather good entertainment for an evening.  It has a good story and has an interesting twist near the end.  If I had nothing better to do I would watch it again.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|A very touching story of a true survivor. It's inspiring to know that if Jaycee still sees the light and good in everything.
B009UNGYHG|3.0|I wish it were made better.  The top of the charging device is a cheap plastic and if you hit it too hard it will break.  The convenience of the case is that I can use the old Plantronics earpiece charger to charge the device which keeps me from having to travel with multiple USB cords.  I do like the fact that it is inexpensive which could explain the devices makeup.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I was disappointed in this book, I find that I usually can read Sookie books over and over but this one kind of just fizzles
B0000AMRJC|4.0|DVD was in good shape and box was also in good shape. Very professional experience and thankful for the opportunity.
B009NH6JRE|5.0|Amc hit on it on the nail with this series  love it the cast is great the show is great can wait for more
B008Y212PI|4.0|I love this app. I love puzzles and this game was the best puzzle app I have found. It's a very addictive game. There are many levels. With many different sizes puzzles. Overall good for anyone who wants a puzzle change.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Funny and scary at the same time loved it laughed so hard great movie youll love it youll love it too
B00867GKIK|5.0|This is not just a great animated movie, it is a great movie period.  The Blue Ray enhances the experience quite a bit, not so sure about the 3D since it was 3D'd retroactively (Wreck it Ralph had better 3D effects, but lower quality animation).
1451695195|5.0|Received in a timely matter.  I already read the book and I found it to<br />be a great book. I have recommended it to my friends and family.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Need a camera and could not find one for free....I ended up getting this one and now I'm just fine...
B00CTT9646|1.0|Regardless of the debacle over the special features spread thinly across many different stores, I was looking forward to my replica Phaser. I removed it carefully from the box and raised it to admire it in the mirror and the damn thing broke into two pieces. Very shoddy.<br /><br />Problem is, I can't return it because Amazon are out of stock.<br /><br />Very disappointed.
B00594XOZU|1.0|Well it was working fine and all but I needed to log out, and I've tried everything and all it says each time is ERROR! C'mon get it together this is stupid! ✟
0307476073|4.0|So far I like it. I'm a single momma so time is hard to come by which is why I haven't read too much but what I have read is good.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Awesome game!  Challenging but easy enough for kids. I really like how quickly the game tallys you score. Then allowes you to start Againn!
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|This could be termed a soap opera of sorts, but the acting and actors raise it above such a mundane title.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I have downloaded Kindle for Android but everytime I try to download a book I get a message saying I don't have it. That is the only reason for one star.

B008US4PBY|4.0|My boyfriend sold our xbox and I prefer the controllers for xbox. Now this device makes it easy so I can still enjoy playing with my controller and we can still play together. Having to have a long cord is annoying, but it makes al the difference!
B005H5H3LW|4.0|Great movie, brought back some childhood memories, enjoyed every bit of the story.  Action pack adventure, with some memorable scene....
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|This game downloaded with no problems. It is challenging and fun to play. I have put many hours into playing this so far. You can replay the levels you beat and try for a higher score.
0486295559|5.0|Hands down book wins. I'm pretty sure this is where Nick Sparks got his idea for the Notebook only Jane Austen is &#34;THE BOSS&#34; and he is her employee.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|It was a slow moving and boring book to me - I read it because I paid for it but would seriously hesitate before buying another book by this author.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|Good mix of challenging words and funny story line...enough to keep my 8 year old entertained and bus entertained while he read it aloud.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Excellent.  Very powerful for all ages.  Will share as Christmas gifts.  Can't go wrong.  Shared with our son and he was moved to tears
B0001VV1GK|5.0|I first bought this for a friend's son. It became his favorite toy from 2 to 4 years old. So, I bought this ecologically sound product for my grandson. He's a year and a half and loves the flexibility of using it with different cars and trucks,  the movement of the elevator and cars down the ramp.
B00003CXD5|5.0|This was the first Humphrey Bogart movie I rented on VHS in the days of Video Store rentals. I became a fan of Bogart maybe two decades later I have collected on DVD more of Bogart movies than any other actor.  The movie had a great moral story and well directed by John Huston.
B001N3GUIE|4.0|Robbie was my first encounter with robots and gave me lots to think about. The plight of the Krell also gives us something to think about in our own automation evolution. Where will it end up?
B008Y212PI|3.0|very fun game really enjoyed it. like the fact that its not super hard . like the fact that you don't have to pass any levels to get to the next part of the game..
1419705644|4.0|This book was a very entertaining read. Those who are looking for a complete compendium of the cast of the show may be somewhat disappointed by the (often opinionated) dictation done by the character of Hunson Abadeer, who will often provide his personal views on the merits of the characters therein. Still, others who have a familiarity with the show will find these non-sequiters very entertaining.
1781162646|5.0|No blood and guts here, just more masterful plot-writing and suspense by one of America's best writers. He is rarely a disappointment but this book was a real treat.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This was one of the first apps I downloaded when I received my Kindle Fire HD last Christmas. It has wonderful graphics, a nice selection of sounds, and is easy to learn but increasingly challenging. Lots of stars for this little app.
0938045768|5.0|System works if you FOLLOW it. No shortcuts. It is what you make of it. Don't blame the info if you fail to listen to it.
B0026OR1UK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book in two ways:  1 - I was very entertaining and well written with new ideas I had not heard of before about how people learn (especially how the most talented people have learned to be so talented).  2 - I also found it useful for myself and have begun to try to apply these concepts to my own learning.
B00004W510|5.0|Bought this for my husband, as he is a fan. He just loved all the tracks. This is a great album.
B002KYXO7A|2.0|The movie rental loaded on my smart TV fine, but it tended to glitch & the sound skipped several times. I though $3.99 was too expensive for an older movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's so much fun to play with the minions. I can't believe they made this type of game.<br /><br />Enjoy playing
B0018PH3L0|5.0|Consummate western.  The relationships shared and grown between the characters make this an exceptional story.<br />Two simple men devoted to one another.  Women they have loved and lost. Sub-layer of cowboys struggling and learning and surviving.  It's just an extraordinary film and I absolutely love it.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I enjoy this I Love the colors and noises it is much more fun then the original flow some levels are hard but I figure them out.
0375703764|1.0|I realize I'm a little late in the game on this one, but I wanted to give a heads up to other readers that purchase this book. It is not a straightforward work of fiction. I personally wouldn't consider it horror or suspense. It is layer upon layer of commentary and streams of consciousness on everything and anything. Crazy fonts, quotes and footnotes.<br /><br />I read it and sat with it for a few days and then went back to it, hoping I would see what everyone else sees. In the end, I just didn't care anymore. For me, the kiss of death for an author is apathy. I truly could care less about the hidden meanings or anything else about the characters, story or author.
B00594XOZU|1.0|Kik was my life. I used it more than my phone and all of a sudden i accidentally click remove from device. I thought i could log back on but instead its said it is taking too long.

0205313426|5.0|it is wonderful. What else can I say?<br />It's concise and I finished reading the entire thing in a day.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It tests your brain and keeps you entertained. No 1 room is the solved the same and each one is more exciting. Each puzzle is more exciting and harder to crack as the game progresses!
0425263991|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo230NUXOCOW776]]I've been waiting for Kaleb's story for years it seems. This book met most of my expectations and answered many questions.

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is such an addicting game. I absolutely love it. I stay up all night playing this game and I still can't get enough of it. I recommend not only to fans of the movies but to those that are looking for something to pass time and have fun.
B0062OCNAI|3.0|This is a great story and it read well but it was a little too long for content.  It became repetitious and went over and over the same things.  It moves along - until it repeats itself - and it's a good read.  It just needs a bit of condensing.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Great game. Not too many good free games out there, but this is one of them. Why turn down a good free game?
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|Great new music from NIN, you will not be disappointed, Seller was extremely reliable and we received the CD before expected. Which is always a bonus round.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|This was a great performance by Brad Pitt. It had everything, romantic leanings, heartache, action, suspense and a bit of horror.
B005IS565S|5.0|Killer CD, these guys never disappoint, musically rock hard, lyrics are always thought provoking, in some case provocative, not obscene, just the interesting use of language.  Yes buy this CD
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Great alternate timeline story about the meeting of Carol Marcus, and Kaun. Lots of great special effects, great alternate actors.
0345803485|5.0|I received right on time. The book is great! Good story, very interesting. O am looking forward to purchase the rest of the books of the story.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|I have only played a few levels but I really like this game. The graphics are great, the interaction is fun, and the game has good challenges for being on a Kindle...worth the price, I would recommend this game.
B008CRC506|5.0|My family and I love musicals so what better program to have than a regular series that was about making musicals?  We looked forward to seeing this show every week and was sad when it was cancelled.
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|This is a fun game, graphics are nice. The levels can be a bit easy, but they do give some challenges so it isn't to easy. I would recommend this game. My six year old daughter loves this game, she always wants me to challenge her in the two player mode...we always get a kick out of playing against each other.
B00915G6MG|5.0|This season of NCIS was as good as the last 9. I am sad Ziva has left the show, but hopefully she will return sometime soon.
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|With this I no longer have to spend $$$ on batteries or take-out-recharge-and-replace rechargeables. I simply drop the mouse on the charger and that's that. OSX reports the mouse at ~30% charge, but it stays there and I see no problems at all.

B00BT70J7M|5.0|Formally ranked 408 on Amazon.co.uk.<br /><br />Sony classical renowned for their excellent box sets,such as RCA Classical living stereo,have made a production out of Kaufmann-the Verdi Album. There  are translations of the arias in English,French and German. In the booklet there is Kaufmanns opinion about the arias he had sung in this album. He states that he has sung the Duke in Rigoletto,conducted by Nello Santi in the Zurich opera house in 2005. He is going to sing his first Manrico in Il Trovatore at the 2013 Munich Opera Festival. At the end of 2013 he is looking forward to his stage debut in a new production of La Forza Del Destino at the Bavarian State opera. Yet where Othello is concerned Kaufmann reckons he will leave that mighty opera for three years.So  I am going to approach this excellent CD from an entirely different angle,for the details have been covered by  other reviewers.<br /><br />There is an essay in the booklet entitled \\"between dreams and reality:Verdi and his tenors\\". In it there is a discussion about the role of Othello. Domingo states that well meaning advisers tried to discourage him from taking on a role they felt was unsuited to him,and he would not be able to hold a candle to Mario Del Monaco. In turn that tenor had been warned about about inviting comparisons with Ramon Vinay. Yet it had been argued that Vinay too,could never stand comparsion with Martinelli. There is no yardstick that can be used to measure the way a role should be interpreted,define and rethought:each operatic character is redefined by the achievements of individual singers. I should imagine Kaufmann will be told to leave the role alone until he is 50.<br /><br />I became so interested in this reasoning,that I played my 1938 Met Naxos live version of Othello,with Martinelli as Othello,Rethberg Desdemonia and Iago Tibbett. Then compared that recording with Furtwanglers 1951 Salzburg version with Ramon Vinay and Paul Schoffler as Iago. What I found was that the interpretations of the two Othello's were different,as were the voices. Vinay is more baritonal and can soften his notes. Martinelli as far as I could make out through the hiss and crackle,was a typical Italianite dramatic tenor. Whereas Vinay made a fine Tristan in Von Karajans 1952 Tristan and Isolde at Bayreuth;Martinelli could not sing that role. The point I am making, is that with his essentially baritonal voice,Kaufmann could.<br /><br />Kaufmann is that unique tenor whom no one can quite pin down as to who he sounds like. Caruso was the same. He refused to have pupils because he could not teach his technique. But along with Kaufmann,Caruso's voice is instantly recognised.Yet there is no one like Caruso and never will be.Kaufmann has been compared to Vickers and Corelli,both singers I like. But the problem is that these singers have different type of voices and certainly not baritonal. If they have anything in common it is the sheer emotional thrust. This Kaufmann has,but his voice is uniquely his,as this set of popular arias shows.<br /><br />I was listening to my bluray of Adriana Lecouvreur conducted by Mark Elder at the Royal Opera House. Kaufmann in Act 4 is singing a duet with with Angela Gheorghiu.He softens his baritonal voices almost to that of a lyrical tenor;it is amazing.I find his aria from Luisa Miller:'Oh!fede negar potessi..Quando le sere al placido',shows his ability to reduce his voice to a lyrical sound.In the two arias from Othello he does it again.But has this marvellous voice changed;of course it has. But in a very positive way. It takes years to know how far you can go,and this Kaufmann has done. He has not ruined his voice by singing roles that are beyond him. His has been a gradual process. He has moulded his voice so that it is like bronze flickering with sunlight. He has incorporated his lyrical voice into his baritonal one. What a Othello he will make.Also,a Tristan or Siegfried,the like of which we have not seen in our lifetime. Hats off Ladies and Gentlemen,to not only the greatest singer of his generation,but one of the greatest of all time. We have had Maria Callas,now Jonas Kaufmann.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|This is a very interesting account of the hunt for that despicable murderer Bin Laden. I had no idea of all the problems incurred in this story. I really liked the characters. I will view this movie several more times.

0060555661|4.0|Have only read key chapters so far but can see why Graham's such a legendary figure.  Main observations so far:  most if not all of his principles seem timeless and profound, though many of his particular suggestions seem time-bound (e.g., dependent on rates of return, etc. as of 1971-72); and his approach to asset allocation doesn't (of course) reflect concepts and approaches that came along later.  However, Jason Zweig's footnotes and commentary go far toward bringing things up to date - though they, in turn, are based in the investing world as of circa 2003 and (of course) don't reflect whatever we have learned or should have learned from the Great Recession and subsequent events.  Nonetheless, the two men's writings, taken together, strike me as well worth studying - and periodically revisiting.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|Oh what to say.  My mind melded with the musical artists.  I floated in the wonderment of how this high quality of song can even be in existence
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|I am a huge fan of Rainbow Rowell! I read all of her books and can't wait for the next. So entertaining and touching. Love all of her characters and storylines. Fangirl was so much fun. A must-read!
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|Was not a fan until this cd...a little AC/DC, Metallica, GnR...loved it...hope they'll stick to this format on the next one...
B001FZ0A72|5.0|Nothing compares to DCDlive but this is without a doubt one of the best studio albums of all time. Rock on Dead Can Dance!!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I've been using the Kindle APP for quite awhile, from PC to my Droid and now on a tablet. I think it's great. I still haven't totally figured out how to retrieve my documents which are forwarded to a kindle email address, but I'm sure as soon as I have some time it will be as simple as the rest of all of the Kindle APP's.<br />Definitely give it a &#34;Thumbs Up !!&#34;
034580404X|5.0|The author writes visually keeping you wanting to turn the page! it makes all your senses come alive. Buying this series was a good decision.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It was different how the author tied up all the loose ends at the end of the book. This was a good page turner and I enjoyed it.
B000002A46|5.0|I love Mariah Carey and this album made my day. It is one of her older albums, but she still sounds amazing and I listen to it year-round. A great buy for MC fans!
0399255370|5.0|I purchased this book for my 4 year old grandson and we had fun reading it.  Now my son reads it to my grandson at bedtime and he cracks up every time he reads about the part about the peach crayon bring naked.  I think it is now the adult reader's favorite book to read.  There are lots of lessons in the book.  I am happy I purchased it.
B0009A40ES|2.0|I was not very impressed with American Psycho. The characters were lacking real depth and I just wasn't overall impressed with how the movie turned out.
B008Y212PI|5.0|If you enjoy puzzles and pleasant graphics this game is for you. No nagging sounds to drive you crazy just what a puzzle game should be. I suggest you download this logic puzzle and begin the fun. This game is most definitely a 5 star game. I am over thirteen amazon. Isn't this 20 words yet?
6305882592|5.0|I love this movie. I highly recommend this movie. It's truly touching and will leave a lasting impression. It also has an amazing soundtrack.
B00E0SX118|5.0|Great movie for adults or children great story. This is one I will watch again and again. my ten year old nephew loved it as well he is a big movie lover. I highly recommend this to all.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|Such a great film. The acting is great, the characters are fantastic. The soundtrack is really good too. I highly recommend this movie.
B007SGM084|5.0|Everyone women loves these books and men should read them to. Great read for those who enjoy the darker side as well as a great romance novel
B003JTHXOK|5.0|What an amazing story. Nicholas Sparks never fails. This is a must read and inspiring story that love knows no bounds and there are second chances
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son loves this game as do most little boys. He plays this game daily and is constantly building new worlds.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Truly gifted artist who can move the soul with an effortless flick of the wrist. Truly amazing. I will most certainly be adding more of her work to my collection.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Not a bad remake of the classic game. Nothing beats this game and it was cool watching my kids play the game.
B00CATONCA|5.0|It's an amazing product. It's the centerpiece to my DVD collection. Freaks ppl out and makes me smile knowing it does
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is the ultimate craze that swept the nation. It is a great free game that I do believe that everyone who is able to has played this game at one point or another
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Cant stop playing this game. So many waves compared to the first one. More allies and enemies that get harder each wave
B0014CQNTK|5.0|I love this movie and the price was perfect for me. Now I can watch the movie whenever I want to
B008HK3XU4|4.0|The case looks like it will stand up through the years.  I like the color and the feel of the case.  It's not too slick and shouldn't slip out of your hand too much.
B005HSL626|5.0|Great easy mindless game to play when you just want to relax and pass time away. Great for Doctor's office and kids
0786956291|2.0|it's a cool game, but complicated for 13 year old, and adult who did not have any prior experience with the D&D.  it is nice to have a game not on a computer the kids will actually show interest.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the perfect game at any age to pass time when you are not able to have a phyiscal deck of cards
B0036FOGTW|5.0|I loved this book. While I am not entirely convinced of the ease of implementation that Moyo suggests, her plan is revolutionary, exciting and well supported. It's a real contradiction to my current worldview, but that made me appreciate it all the more. And perhaps best of all, the book trade like a novel, as Moyo's passionate, satiric yet empathetic voice shines through the unconditional content. I'm very impressed.
0670022705|5.0|Having heard the series based on this book on NPR two years ago I decided to buy the book for my own edification, as well as to keep on my coffee table for the pleasure of parents of my piano students who sit and wait during lessons.  Interestingly enough, several of my students' fathers travel and made it a point to go to the original exhibit on which the book is based after reading the book!
B004DTLK62|5.0|A Classic. Why Robert Downey Jr. did<br />not receive an Oscar for this performance will forever be a travesty.  Only 26 at the time, his portrayal of Chaplin, is one for the ages. It goes beyond mimicry to the heart of the 1st globally known movie star's personal beliefs and stuggles, all deftly handled by another master of the craft. Much has been made of the movie's lofty attempt to include all of Chaplin's life and its lack of including more about his movie making  But it works because Downey is perfection in his portrayal of a man committed to his true love - movie making. If you want to learn about Chaplin's movies, watch them.  If you want to learn where his genius came from and his motivations behind his movies, watch Downey's genius in portraying him.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Quite intuitive, smooth operation. Can browse products and purchase items in a very simple fashion. As easy to use as the desktop browser
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|this is by far the best movie I've seen all year giant monsters and giant robots fighting each other what else could you expect from a summer blockbuster like this  movie kicked ass so bad!! if you like Godzilla movies then this movie is definitely for you.it will get your adrenaline going and your blood pumping five star movie here.
1439153663|2.0|I actually think this could have been a good novel with the help of a good editor. The storyline has a lot of potential but the actual execution left something to be desired. There were some well written parts, but in many others she basically skipped over the drama. The effect left you disconnected from the characters. I also thought her secondary voice in the novel many times just reiterated what the primary voice had already told us. The secondary voice also gave away secrets that would have been way more interesting if we had learned them in some other fashion.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|First book I've read by Liane Moriarty, but it won't be the last.  I like the way she told this story as it really captured my interest and imagination.  I have already recommended the book to a local book club.
B009KEN87O|4.0|The game is made up of lots of small waves and upgrades don't last between waves which is unsatisfying.  Otherwise fun, good for kids.
B000ZJTPLG|4.0|The sound is great through my iPhone ear buds.  I would like more responsiveness of the volume, gain and tone controls.  But for this size and price, the Vox is totally worth it.  Makes practicing a much easier experience and others in the home aren't blown away.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love this app. All of my friends have it and it's super fast. I wouldn't change anything about kik. It's awesome and I hope you like it to. :)
0765356139|5.0|I really loved the first Mistborn novel.  I will say this novel didn't hold up as well as the first, but I'm still looking forward to the rest of the series.  The beginning of the novel was very slow.  It starts about a year after the revolution of the first book.  Luthadel is besieged by three noble armies, one of them giants called Koloss led by Elend's former friend, one by Straff Venture, Elend's father, and one by Lord Cett, a brash handicapped nobleman.  To make matters worse Elend is impeached by his parliament while Vin spends her evenings battling Zane an insane mistborn loyal to Straff.  There are a lot of themes explored in this book; democracy, leadership, loyalty, politics, and responsibility.  Most of these are explored well.  The one that isn't is the love story between Vin and Elend.  I loved them in the first book and spent most of this one annoyed.  Literally their entire plot could have been resolved if they had taken 5 minutes to have a conversation during the year this novel takes place.  On the bright side Sazed becomes a viewpoint character and he's fascinating.  In summary, this isn't an improvement on the first book, but I'm still looking forward to the rest of the series.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Bought this book on a whim because it sounded interesting and the cover caught my eye. So happy I did! Started reading it and couldn't stop till I finished. This will def be one of those books I read again and again. Highly recommended.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|This is great who dunnit murder mystery drama from the BBC. David Tennant is brilliant in this role, as he is in everything he does.<br />Gritty British TV Drama at its best.
B004N6369Y|4.0|This is a very enjoyable book to read. Danielle Steel can keep your attention and make you want to keep reading the book. Sometimes they are very hard to put down.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|As a long time Kenny Loggins fan I saw him in concert with the Blue Sky Riders.  They are a talented group and compliment eachother beautifully!  I listen to this album repeatedly in the car on my way to work.  Don't miss Little Victories.  It is a sweet song with lyrics every person can relate to.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Like the way the scheme unfolded, the characters, and of course, the ending.  Justice was served which the killer deserved!
B00005S6K6|4.0|This is another classic.  It was fun watching these actors in movies they did a long time ago in their careers.  A good love story.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved this book............so many twists and turns that really surprise the reader.<br />Almost as if this scenario could really happen in &#34;real life&#34;
1439152810|5.0|This book succeeded in so many ways for me.  It had a little bit of everything: history, romance, tragedy and mystery.  I was completely absorbed with the Nicholson's family story as Laurel, the eldest of 5, tries to uncover her dying mother's past.  Who was Dorothy Nicholson during WWII and what compelled her to commit an act of violence on an apparent stranger in front of their home in 1961?<br /><br />Morton delivers so many excellent components to the story, from the atmosphere of London under siege in 1941, to the warmth of the Nicholson family and the camaraderie between the siblings throughout the years.  Despite a few predictable elements, there were enough twists and turns in the plot to keep me engaged.  The conclusion was highly satisfying and overall story really resonated with me.  It was such fun trying to predict the outcome, and whether or not I guessed correctly, it kept me on my toes.<br /><br />I received a complimentary copy of this book via the Goodreads First Reads program.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I am a lifelong Stephen King \\"junkie\\". Loved the story and as usual, I couldn't put it down! It surpassed all my expectations.
B00005R1N3|5.0|An early classic horror film.  Classy and very well made with a killer (excuse the pun) ending.  I have always felt that this is the best horror film ever made, and I actually made this particular purchase for my cousin, another true horror movie fan.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|Would have given it 5 stars if it would have excepted charging cords easier.<br />Case is lite and very durable
B0052TDGQO|5.0|My wife is a big fan of Scotty and just had to have his first releases. Amazon provided me with a quick and inexpensive way to fill that need.
B005HSL626|5.0|I Love this game and it's super addictive!!! I think that everyone should play this game. My age is 16years old.
B00CTT9646|3.0|The movie is little disappointing. Poor rehash of the Wrath of Khan with a slight twist. Not up to the quality of the first J. J. Abrams Star Trek. In this series Kirk and Spock have not been together long enough to develop the friend ship that made the loss of one so devastating in the original. Three D is good and overall the acting and chemistry between the characters is very good. The phaser is pretty cool, with a good weight but the revolving fire chamber is just cheap painted plastic. Would have been nice if you could pull the trigger and some LED s would light up. When I get a break from classes i am going to try and add a battery and some LED s on my own.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Really enjoying this game wish it was longer! It's challenging and like that it has different options for screen size! Hopefully more games to come
B000MD9UJC|2.0|i broke my Maglite during installation, tossed it out and bought a  FENIX E21 so I never got to see it work. my advice just buy a new flashlight saves you a lot of work get the brand of your choice .if you want a $35 flashlight buy a $35 flashlight in the first place
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|got it because i wanted one and you had some in stoke... the price could be better but its all good...
B005O7OC6C|5.0|Now I can use my pen again. We all are always writing with key boards. Ok, world is changing and computers are part of our lives but it's the good thing to write on a paper about your feelings and to read it five years later. I bought two of this journal, one for me and one for my daughter. Love it!
0763660531|5.0|Great example of how pictures can tell a story without words!  Great first book by Aaron Becker.  I look forward to his next picture book.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I rely on my phone as my alarm. This app allows me to have different alarms for various purposes. The selection of alarm tones is pretty good, and you can have it start out softly and the volume rises over several seconds. The snooze feature works nicely. You can select the amount of time between alarms. The snooze &#34;button&#34; is larger than the dismiss, making it easy to pick the snooze button, even when I am still mostly asleep
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I did not expect the film to be as good as the play, I was wrong! It was just as good in fact gave the characters more depth. Excellent film .
B005HSG3VK|3.0|This is an okay case, nothing special, except it does help protect the Kindle. It won't stay propped up, but owell...
B003U6BE8I|5.0|Looking for a quick simple film to kill time on a short flight this is it, Very entertaining would actually like to see a part two.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|We bought this dvd as a gift for my wife's daughter.  I am sure she will enjoy this movie to add to her collection.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I did not have many expectations for this movie, but I LOVED it.  I watched it back-to-back.  It is very fun and definitely a booster!
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|Our whole family enjoyed this movie. It is definitely not for the younger ones. But we as a family sat and enjoyed it.
B003XRELEI|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut is in a class by himself. Read this if you want to laugh outloud. A lot. \\"A flying saucer creature named Zog arrived on Earth to explain how wars could be prevented and how cancer could be cured. He brought the information from Margo, a planet where the natives conversed by means of farts and tap dancing.\\"
B0026KX5PO|5.0|The unthinkable and unimaginable well played out by a very credible cast in a different era.  Identity theft in the worst possible way; desperation, obsession, and greed.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I'm not sure how we missed this gem during the first run, but we are enjoying it now and looking forward to season 2!!
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|I was hooked from the first illusion! Now You See Me does not disappoint. Sequel? Must pay attention throughout. Great
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This app is wonderful! Some people don't like it because they can't play the airplane game but if u go 2 the settings u can turn it off. This app is ssssssooooooo fun. U have to get it!
0345511468|5.0|I'll admit that I was one of the kids who was counting down the days to the release of \\"Jedi\\" back when it was new. I've been collecting books, videos, and magazine articles about the making of this film ever since, in an effort to peek behind the curtain and see how the magic was made.<br /><br />Despite my efforts to know it all, this book contains hundreds of photos I've never seen before, thousands of facts and details that have never been brought to light previously, and a perspective that only a true insider could bring. Like Rinzler's previous books on the Making of \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Empire\\", this is without a doubt the definitive tome on the subject. Even after thirty years of familiarity with this film and the process of its creation, I am amazed at the amount of new information contained in this book.<br /><br />Making \\"Return of the Jedi\\" was an enormous undertaking, approximately as big a project the first two Star Wars films combined. The creative and technical challenges involved in making this film were daunting, and it is really inspiring to see how everybody involved found innovative and ingenious ways to \\"up the ante\\" on what the previous Star Wars films (or ANY film for that matter) had done before. The efforts of these master storytellers are all the more impressive given the fact that they operated in a \\"pre-digital\\" world where sets, costumes, characters, and vehicles were all \\"analog\\" creations that had limitations and practical constraints that no longer exist in film making. The creative process and the problem-solving process required to clear these hurdles are very well documented here.<br /><br />In short, this is an absolutely fabulous book about the process of making a film. Rinzler was given the keys to the Lucasfilm archives to make this book, and has brought to light a ton of remarkable and insightful material that fans can pore over for years to come.
B006CEYM3Y|5.0|We have some German-style board games in our house, but this game has absolutely different mechanics! We love it! Probably I wound not recommend it to someone with zero experience in board games, but if you already have at least moderate experience - try this one!
B00E4W40C4|4.0|The extended version itself is NOT in 3D but the only way to get it is if you buy the BLU RAY 3D set<br /><br />If you want the actual movie, buy this version
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|Americah is a beautifully written story that explores the interactions and consequences of race, assimilation and culture.<br />Barbara Bushell<br />5 Stars
B000PUV1ZI|5.0|Hook is on of my of my childhood favorites that still holds my interest as an adult. Classic & timeless.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Needs more app compatibility to really take off but it works wonderfully for $35 device. Really waiting for ability to playback local media and from phone and to sign in to networks requiring username and password.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham is always good.  He is a great author.  All of his books are spellbinding and so interesting.  bla bla
B009XIXVU6|4.0|this book was not what I was expecting, having said that I enjoyed reading it and the message (food for thought) if brought.<br />I recommend it.
B00A7OJ0DC|4.0|This was an adorable and cute movie and even better in 3D! We have watched it 3x thus far. Sarah Silverman is great as &#34;the glitch&#34;.
B009WUAK2M|1.0|Garbage!!  GARBAGE11<br /><br />everything about this movie is terrible...except, possibly, the bottom line.  it probably made money.  everyone involved should be so proud
B0019O6IWU|5.0|This book is absolutely wonderful for helping to shine some light on the way in which our words effect our self-love, relationships, and ability to truly connect. It's a fast read and it seriously stimulated self-reflection. I think it will require a couple readings to allow the principles and applications of NVC to resolution ale route but I think it's totally worth it!
B00005JLEU|5.0|The order met all of my required expectations. It was cased properly, the disc was in good shape and the movie was good.
0316204366|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell creates another masterpiece that is thought-provoking and once again insists you adjust the way you see the world.  I think this book is his best book since Outliers and has the potential to create a greater cult following.  For all the hater's out there they don't understand the power of the underdog. If you want to know how to create your own Cinderella story this books gives you good insights and shows you how to use your weaknesses to your advantage whether in sports, business or life in general.  Once again Malcolm Gladwell takes a fascinating subject matter and brings it to life by uncovering gems of wisdom along the way.<br /><br />One of the other reviews summed it up perfectly \\"This is an important and fascinating book which demonstrates how much of what is beautiful and important in the world arises from what looks like suffering and adversity, and wherein corporate honchos as well as the man on the street will find valuable insights.\\"  Life is about facing challenges and it is how we face those giants in our lives that determines the outcome.  This book provides a roadmap and entertains all along the journey, painting fascinating stories and facts from studies that are impossible to overlook once they are brought to light.  I assume that those that don't like this book are either those that profess to be Goliaths or actually are Goliaths, don't let those pessimists hold you back and read this book you won't regret it!
B004DK5CYM|4.0|I was barely old enough to remember Secretariat, but I do recall the races. He was one of the greatest champions in all of sports. Some of the story line is exaggerated but I don't mind the writers doing that to add drama.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|This was one of my favorite movies in my high school days & I enjoyed it just as much this time although I always wished it had a better ending. Sort of left you up in the air as to what she was going to do but then so many movies are like that.
B007JNR518|5.0|An excellent story of overcoming a traumatic incident and healing. Robert Redford was great, and Scarlet Johansson was amazing in her first role.
B000B2YQX4|3.0|My CD case was cracked when I got it :( ...not a huge deal....but it was gift...and looked kinda bad.They should have packed it better!
0374533555|5.0|Enjoy reading the book as often it quotes studies that I've read about.  A very common sense approach is used when the author gives details of the point he is trying to make.  A fun book..
B000HEZF0E|1.0|It's in a format I can't use , most dvds that add HDV to their listing can be played on a regular dvd, NOT this one , no wonder it was such a good deal !!!
B006IDG2T6|4.0|It appears that Free will is always explored in the context of crimes committed or morality play. This book too tries to put &#34;free will&#34; in the same perspective. Is &#34;Free will&#34; is a matter of brain pathology or the existence of an entity called &#34;mind&#34; beyond it is not answered. Perhaps, it cannot be done at this stage of research. This book is a must read for those who want to study human behavior in an objective manner.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|A large part of my enjoyment in these types of novels comes from trying to deduce the mystery in advance. However in this case the author has, in my option, given extremely flimsy explanations for critical aspects of the premise.<br /><br />** spoiler **<br /><br />The explanation given for the events that lead to the death of all the residents of silo 17 was simply that it was the result of \\"one bad day\\", and that the revolt at our hero's silo lead them dangerously close to the same fate. Apparently, the designers of these silos had anticipated this supposed fragility and thus made it a priority that the silos are completely isolated and unaware of each other so that this mythical 'one bad day' would affect only one silo and not cascade to others.<br /><br />As I was reading, I assumed that the author was going to reveal how the original silo designers were wrong and that those assumptions are nonsense. However that never happened. The author gave no alternate explanation for the collapse of silo 17 and even at the end at least one of the \\"good guys\\" seemed to honestly believe that their silo had been on the verge of a similar collapse. It seems like the author actually agrees with this \\"one bad day\\" logic which is completely ridiculous. There is no basis for that kind of reasoning. People aren't going to suddenly go insane and rush outside en masse for a group suicide just because of an internal revolt, regardless of which way it goes. It makes no sense. I was very disappointed. Perhaps this logic will be challenged and shown invalid in later sequels, unfortunately that will be too late to save this book.
B000YAA68W|5.0|This coming of age story of a young Iranian girl would be a compelling storry in any medium, and could have easily been a live action film. But keeping it animated and maintaining the look of the original graphic novel brings a whole new realm of simplistic beauty. It's not as elaborate as one gets with American or Japanese animation, but its simplicity conveys an amazing amount of heart that is not to be missed.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I downloaded this free solitare app a few days ago and I haven't been able to put it down. Love it!
B001ECQ75A|5.0|This has become my comfort food movie. If I'm feeling sick I'll grab a cup of tea, pop this in and I start feeling a little better almost instantly. The fanboy nature of Po is amazingly endearing and I will never get over how fantastically realized the action scenes are (especially Tai Lung's escape.)
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Like this one best of all the ones I've played.  Wish the call of numbers was just a little bit slower
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great!!! This cartoon movie is a wonderful way to pass the time.  Watch it with people you deeply care about.
0399160450|5.0|I bought this book for a gift for my dad.  He was very happy and surprised.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.
B004P7CN5O|5.0|For anyone who appreciates humor with their horror...if Quintin Tarentino is in it or has directed it, it has to be good!
B00F35B8F8|1.0|Apparently the crew of the Enterprise was very, very naughty because they've all been frozen in rank and condemned to spend eternity dong the same jobs and recycling the same plot scenarios forever.  (Heck, even the same d*mn scenes!) Plus RoboCop. (Google it).  Pathetically bad. &#34;Dammit Jim, I'm a hack, not a screenwriter!&#34;  Connnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!
B007A04NYM|5.0|I've been eyeing this on vinyl for a while and when it became available on Amazon recently, I jumped at the opportunity to own it.  The only sad part that it does not have &#34;I'll Be Over You&#34;, which is from another album.  Having said that, the collection of tracks on this album is worth every penny.
B008BQLH52|5.0|I felt compelled to give this five stars and write a review simply because this show deserves it and I don't want to see it disappear.  It's clever and thinks ahead.  The producer and writers are brilliant.  This is a show that you binge watch because you can't get enough of it.  Keep them coming.
0140544518|5.0|I remember this book from when I was a kid, and I bought it for my children recently. They love it as well, and it's as great as I remember!
B0058ZZDVS|5.0|I felt compelled to give this five stars and write a review simply because this show deserves it and I don't want to see it disappear.  It's clever and thinks ahead.

B003QZ5222|4.0|It's an awesome collection,  and for the price,  an even better value. Only criticism is that I was unable to rip darkness on the edge of town onto my xbox where I back up my music collection.  Otherwise,  this would receive 5 stars.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Along with bad piggies, this is my favorite rovio game yet. keep updating this please! trololol.<br />pls hurry and make more games
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This book reminded me a little of The Help which was one of my favorites.  The Kitchen House was incredible.  At times, it was upsetting, but it had you wanting to know what happens next.
B008YKGQR4|2.0|Gives you all you need,even was able to play some game's on my kindle that you normally can't!! Everyone knows this if you have a kindle... But it seems to have a mind of it's own! When you go to hit the like it brings up the whole post? And I went to change my profile picture I hit the change and it brought up the whole picture on another page?? When I'm on a like page and hit a picture I want to look at that's fine but when I'm done, I'll try to go back but it doesn't take me back to the like page it takes me to my timeline....
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Refreshing to have an app perform as promised. No depending on wake up calls at hotels. I even use it at home. Bravo!
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I think  should get this game because it fun  what  , u..do the bird  in so fun get this  game
B006W0QR1S|5.0|Caught in the city between  old school gangsters and trying to care for a neighbor. This is what the cool kids will like.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I was so endorsed in this book. The way Erin allowed Kevin to hit her and abuse her without fighting back . Once she did get away from Kevin SHE finally met a man,Alex who loved her unconditionally. Domestic violence is so rampant and it is too sad the police won't do anything until it is too late for many women. Kevin finally got what he deserved.<br />Helenheckman
B00D2K40WY|3.0|The game is fun..... it is you tablet space but I wish it would let you choose other girls recommended

B00867HDTA|3.0|It's a nice game that can entertain you for an half an hour, but it gets boring after a while. You can enjoy a challenge with your friends, though. The control of the ball is very easy to understand. Overall difficulty is quite low.<br />It's not bad, but it's not good either...
1476727651|5.0|This book feels like a special gift from Stephen King to his Constant Readers who have stuck by him faithfully through the long dark years from 1987 until now.  If you loved almost everything Stephen King wrote from The Long Walk through the Big Four (Carrie, 'Salem's Lot, The Shining, and the original version of The Stand) to the magnum opus that was IT, and right up through Misery, and then felt like at that point aliens had kidnapped him and replaced him with an overly verbose imposter who had gained the power to reject any and all editing advice and had lost the ability to write anything with the raw, emotional power of the final scenes of IT, then this book is for you.  If after reading the overly long natural disasters called the Tommyknockers, Needful Things, Dreamcatcher, Duma Key, etc., you stuck it out anyway, this book is for you.  If you read the 1400+ page new version of The Stand and were dumbstruck at the ability of an author to destroy one of the best books ever written, but stuck it out anyway, this book is for you.  If after finishing the last four books of The Dark Tower saga, you stacked the entire series on the barbecue grill in your back yard and purified them of the evil contained within by setting them on fire, this book is for you.  If you read THE PASSAGE by Justin Cronin and thought to yourself, \\"This is the Stephen King book I have been waiting for since 1987,\\" this book is for you.  Most importantly, if you recoiled in fear when you heard that the alien who had replaced Stephen King was going to write a sequel to THE SHINING!!!, and were terrified beyond any scare you ever received from a Stephen King novel (even 'Salem's Lot) at the prospect that poor old Danny Torrance, who should have received enough punishment at the Overlook Hotel for any one lifetime, was about to be \\"Black Housed\\" and suffer the Lovecroftian fate (\\"it was too horrible to describe\\") of Jack Sawyer from the Talisman, THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU!!!  It is truly safe to go back in the water.  The Tommyknocker aliens have come back to earth, and put the original Stephen King back in his body again.  Don't pass go, don't collect $200, go directly to your favorite bookstore and get this book!  This book hops and moves from the very first page and never stops going.  It's as if the best parts of Carrie, 'Salem's Lot, The Shining, The Stand, and Firestarter got mixed up in a bottle, shaken AND stirred, and then got poured out onto the page where they were melded together in a more mature tone and voice in which the life experiences (alcoholism, drug abuse, even the aftermath of the accident) of the Master inform the narrative in a gut wrenchingly honest way that isn't the least bit polemic.  There is none of the 300 pages of bloated, unneccessary character development filler that characterized so many of the Stephen King books of the last 20+ years (did anyone else out there feel sick to their stomach that they actually waded through every page of INSOMNIA waiting for the payoff that never came???).  And there are none of the horrible \\"don't turn the page if you can't handle the truth\\" endings like in Black House and The Dark Tower.  This is a pure, stripped down sports car of a novel that feels like it poured out of the Master's typewriter in one long writing session.  This book is so good it more than makes up for the sheer horror of reading The Regulators, 11/22/63, Under the Dome, and every other bloated mess of a novel we Constant Readers faithfully endured.  I truly had given up hope that I would ever be able to read a real Stephen King novel again.  It's the kind of feeling you get when you realize there will never be another Harry Potter novel ever again.  Thank you, Stephen King, THANK YOU!!!  This book was a trip down memory lane to being huddled under the covers with a flashlight and a King masterpiece you just couldn't put down.  If any of the above struck a chord with you and you are still debating whether or not to read this book, debate no more - GET THIS BOOK NOW!!  THE MASTER IS BACK!!!
B009AMANBA|5.0|As a Lincoln fan I really enjoyed this.<br />It sticks close to the facts and doesn't present a sentimentalized story.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The cliff hanger was cool. I am glad their was a preview. Remember to were purple and orange on the eighth!
0765325950|5.0|Sanderson did a good job in finishing the series. Not as long winded as Jordan but I was not displeased with the ending<br />I will now re read the series again and this time it wont take !0+ years
0380715430|4.0|A history of a language could have been tedious, on the contrary the way of writing, of telling of Bill Bryson makes everything light and extremely interesting. It's just a pity I'm not so skilled in English to understand also the local idioms and some nuances of the language.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|We enjoy waiting and watching the entire seasons at one time, rather than paying for satellite for one show all year long. The price for the few tv shows we actually watch on dvd is much lower than paying for satellite.
B0013KTGAG|1.0|Terrible script, terrible direction, terrrible actors, meaningless plot with charactoers one cannot even bother to care about. So is this the state of social consciousness amongst the 20-something crowd?  God help us all.
B005FISBTO|5.0|We have enjoyed watching this series since the beginning, and no longer have satellite. We really enjoyed being able to watch all the episodes when we wanted to.
B007KOYEOC|3.0|Not my cup of tea, only read it because everyone was talking about it. Too much of the same thing
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Yet another title to add to Brandon Sanderson's young adult list but a lot of fun for anyone.<br />This is one of those books you can't put down and left me going in the wrong direction until the end. Dive in and find out what makes Steelheart bleed.
B00C5R8364|5.0|I'm biased and very much so (have been a sucker for Forsyth since mid nineties) but if you like military thrillers, this is the one to read. Set across in multiple time zones, countries and cultures, this novel grips you from the beginning to the end.<br /><br />Set in the completely modern and current world of drones, cyberhacking and fundamentalist terrorism, the pace is brisk and suspenseful. Along the way, you learn a thing or two about Somali culture (or lack thereof) and british humor (A lie can also be termed as being economical with truth).<br /><br />The ending might feel a bit like Hollywood movie but overall this is a book that you will finish in a sitting or two. If this is your first time with Forsyth, this will turn you into a fan. Now, get it and finish it!
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Very moving story line with interesting, likable characters. Once I got into the book, I could hardly put it down.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|High. lari. ous. Recommend it for anyone who enjoys breathing, or singing, or magic, or love, or spontaneous projectile vomiting. (And really, who doesn't?)
1401324649|3.0|Everybody raves about this book, but I have trouble staying with it.  It seems a little silly at times and although it involves historic characters to add interest, I still haven't finished it.  I lent it to a friend and perhaps I will finish it some day.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Good ending to the series.  I got a little tired of the explicit sex, but it was needed to make the story work right.  Glad there was a happy ending.
034580404X|4.0|I bought and read it because of all the craze - Wasn't real impressed - but then again I read Jackie Collins in my era, so no biggie=  I turned around and sold it on FB garage sale site for what I paid so im happy
B004C03TK2|4.0|The dvd was in its original cellophane wrapper.  The only reason I don't give 5 stars is I could not use it in my region.  It was formatted for England and I live in the USA.  I did contact the seller, with no problem, and have shipped it back.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|You won't find a better presentation of this classic sci-fi movie anywhere. I had to replace the HDDVD because of disc-rot. Thanks Warner!
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|This app is top notch!! I use it every day!! I would not think of using any other app for streaming my media. And the guys at PLEX are top notch and willing to help!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I used it once and it didn't work again. Google customer service is pathetic and my replacement device came after four weeks of exchanging emails. Google monopoly is that everyone should use google wallet to replace a device which I am against using it. WORST COMPANY with WORST SERVICE
B002DD67XG|5.0|can't go wrong with James soothing fun memories, what more can one say..soothing fun memories, what more can one say
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I read this book for our book club and we had a good discussion.  The story seemed somewhat unrealistic, but you can't help but relate to this main character.
B009LDD5E0|5.0|bought it for my nephew, he loves this series.  fun video with great music bought it for my nephew, he loves this series.  fun video with great music
0131103628|5.0|I have a PhD. n Electrical Engineering, but I had bought this book two years before I entered college as I wanted to learn C by myself.<br />Three degrees and fifteen years after I still feel this is, if not the best, one of the best technical books I ever read.<br />I could follow it with barely any background on programming back then and yet today I find it so complete and formally correct. It is flawless<br />in every aspect I can think of, and it is a joy to read too. And it is short and concise. I love it.
B0010V4S2O|3.0|it would have been nice to know that this was a region 2 disc (europe). luckily i was able to find a hack for my dvd player to play it!
B000LTAY1U|5.0|this watch was purchased as a replacement for a seiko automatic that was purchased some years ago.  I broke the mineral crystal and on checking for repair found it was cheaper to just buy a new watch.  So far I am pleased.
B00008L3U1|4.0|this was the very first time that I saw Jennifer Lopez - I remember watching this movie in the theater, and thought... &#34;WOW - who is that teacher?????&#34; =)
B000X2H8G4|5.0|I demonstrated the first one I purchased  to an elderly friend who had difficulty using his hearing aid. He commented that the distance between the microphone and his ear eliminated some background noise heard in a hearing aid such as that produced by his own breathing. He didn't want to leave without this device.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I've played Mahjong for years and I prefer it when the tiles and layout of the game represents the real thing.  It's very good to pass the time with while waiting in a doctor's office, at an airport, or anywhere you'd rather not be just waiting.  It is a stress reducing activity that I  enjoy very much.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Good game server issues suck.  Got to level 41 then deleted to stop load issue at 34%.  Get lost in playing.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|I needed office software for my Kindle Fire HD, so I did my research. Kingston Office seemed to offer the most capabilities for the lowest price. (FREE!) So I downloaded it and gave it a try. It was worth it! It meets and exceeds all my expectations and needs. I mostly use spreadsheets, but I use the word processor quite often as well. I would definitely recommend to anyone who needs a full powered office suite for their android device, and who doesn't want to shell out twenty dollars or more for it.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Not sure if it's the cable or the wall plug but the kindle fire charger is awesome. I was having a problem charging my kindle fire with a regular micro USB cable and decided to call Amazon customer service for help. I thought it was a problem with my Kindle Fire. After speaking to the CSR, he told me he was sending me a brand new cable and wall plug for free to see if that would solve the problem. And assured me that if it did not, they would replace my Kindle Fire for free. Talk about customer service! Oh and it did solve my problem!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Addictive. Game. I got it thinking it was just gonna be a silly game but I like it a lot . I am an adult and I love it its cute and fun.
B005DOKL3E|2.0|I should have looked at it closer. I wanted a sleeve that zipped on 3  sides so I could open and use. I have my Kindle in a sleeve that I just open but I wanted one that zips,
067003830X|5.0|This book gives very interesting vignettes for the lay person which are captivating and explained clearly.  The information<br />is very encouraging for all who are interested in neuroscience and its everyday operation.
B0039UTDFG|5.0|Love the entire series.  This Blu-ray was absolutely beautiful on my HDTV. Would recommend for kids and adults! The behind the scenes material as compelling as the documentary itself.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|For adults more than kids! Bought it for our friends 25th anniversary.  The perfect gift for any couple for their anniversary
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I bought Chromecast directly from Google with the impression that I would be able to play video directly from my phone and tablet.  My hope was to play training videos in our conference room without a laptop. I guess I didn't understand what chromecast is.  As best as I can tell it is a glorified youtube and netflix streamer.  Sure, I could upload all our videos to youtube, but we have to keep our property private.  I understand I could stream through the chrome browser but that still requires me to bring a laptop to the training meetings.  Anyway, I figured this most basic of functionality would be included and sent mine back because it isn't.<br /><br />I'm not sure why everyone is so excited about Chromecast.  Doesn't just about any TV made these days include netflix streaming built in?
B0050DIWFC|5.0|As a parent I put myself in the position of this mother throughout this story.  I was brought through wide range of emotional highs and lows.  There were many times in the reading of this book that I experienced  the physical anxiety I believed the parents were feeling and I had to put the book down until I stopped crying.  I have recommended this novel to all my friends.
B009HOU672|5.0|The more I listen to this the more I love it. It was a bold thing to do, in that he probably expected some knocks, but brilliant in its inspiration and execution. I don't love the original any less and am fascinated with what he did.
1401938906|5.0|I have been one of the ones who believed the Law of Attraction existed, but let my self-doubt stand in the way.  I saw immediate evidence when I opened myself up to the first couple of experiments.  It's given me a healthy respect for being aware of my thoughts.  I highly recommend this book to anyone teetering on the edge of acceptance, and definitely to those who need some guidance as to how to make it work in their lives.
B008Y212PI|4.0|It is really a brain game.  Makes you think, it's fun.  Like to see what is coming up to fill the picture.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like this game. Friendly participating neighbors and easy to advance if you,'re willing to work it and visit neighbors to give and receive.
1476734941|5.0|A terrific book of ideas for none who needs to gain control of their eating habits. It has changed our lives,
B00BNGFGIQ|1.0|Didn't get the game. I'm not a young player, so it wasn't my &#34;thing&#34;. I downloaded it for my grandkids, but removed it from my kindle.
B00AC8ZJPQ|4.0|After playing the games, my first reaction to FUD was disappointment, given I was expecting more, but after rewatching it several times I began to like it better. It's a solid story arc and the graphics aren't bad, but the way it was filmed was incomplete, such as when there is major battle going on and no backscreen...only fog. It has a slightly cheap element to the film making that doesn't match up with the epicness of the Halo games, hence the disappointment.<br />The detail is pretty good, but there are some major flaws. Spartan armor doesn't have numbers on it, and everyone who's played the game knows that, but the biggest flaw is the timeline. At this point the Spartans are kids with low ranks. 117 doesn't earn the rank of Master Chief until much later in his life, but that is what he refers to himself as in the film. That sort of retcon is unacceptable.
B00EQ0CKRQ|1.0|It works. One needs patience as it downloads over 100mb on to the device. Its an interesting game though the controls are abit difficult to use. It would very well for most of other game consoles.
B001XCWPAM|5.0|I love this set. Great price for all three. This will make you a fan of Matt Damon if you are not already.
B005QYKD4I|5.0|Suprisingly good, if you like this sort of thing. I went to see one of the xfmr movies on iMax, and I couldn't tell what was happening. Motion sickness...
B0015DYIH2|3.0|The movie wrapped this series up much better than the book. I thought the entire storyline of Bella having a vampire baby was a stretch. I knew she wouldn't die and the twist where Jacob imprints on Reneesme was a little bizarre. I understood the concept, but felt the author was reaching because she really wasn't sure how to wrap the story up.<br /><br />I enjoyed this series very much until this last book. The twists and turns, the characters and love story kept building to a very exciting climax to end with a slight disappoint. I still appreciate the overall love story that was the core of these books, but I think it could have ended just as well as it began.
1594746036|4.0|I almost gave up on this book but once it finally started to go wow did it ever and I could not put it down I left it in Samoa for my mom to read. Very cool book and the pictures are real and go with the story so well.
B007MDB548|5.0|First, I have to comment on the sellers. This product came very well packaged. There was no room for shipping damage. Originally it was to be sent ground, but the sellers upgraded it to first class. I only had to wait a day. Along with it came a personalized 'thank you' with a coupon for future purchases. It was very nice to be thanked for business and given a little incentive to buy from them again. I was very impressed. It was brand-new and much cheaper than retail cost.<br /><br />Secondly, the movie; it is really a great movie. I have an 8 year old daughter and a 6 year old step-daughter. Both girls are still getting used to not being only children, so sharing is a chore. We bought this movie for our step-daughter's birthday as something the girls could enjoy together and we have enjoyed it as a family. The 3-D version is very cool! I also like the story-line. It is a heart-warming story about sisters and how they stop at nothing to be together despite the odds. They fight because they love each other and teach others that anything can be overcome.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to anyone with little girls. Aside from being a fantastic fairytale, the messages in the fairy movies promoting lessons and friendships are wonderful to share!
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I would keep buying this if I had to and I am not a normal country fan.  my mother loved it too so I downloaded it on my iphone and left her the cd
B009FXIICK|3.0|This is a fun game for kids with a sense of humor. The &#34;boss&#34; says some pretty harsh things to the player when they fail. I wish it was possible to go diagonally for matching instead of just up or down.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book adds life to the New Testament. It answered several questions I had about the Catholic religion. One example: Why did Rome end up as the center of a religion that started in what is current day Israel. It was interesting to see an explanation of why the Jews were falsely blamed for the death of Jesus. Maybe best of all was the confirmation that Jesus was preaching for his time which explains why he did not become a leader in the Jewish religion.
0425263924|5.0|I loved this series more than Fifty Shades of Gray and that says a lot !!!!! the man charater Gideon is sooooooooooo intense, but in a way that is more beleivable than Christian Gray is.  The series was supposed to be a trilogy, but the third book ends with an opener and message for a upcoming fourth book.  Happy reading :)
B00B2JSRAS|2.0|While I agree that if you focus on an issue you can expect better results but this book takes it to the absurd. No matter how much you concentrate on one thing, you still cannot expect to change the laws of physics including walking on water.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|There are many heart warming moments in this book. However one only wish that real life could unfold like this story.
B005IQZB14|3.0|An amazing story of wonder and loss. As the author comes to understand herself, test herself and break free of the grief that is ruining her life, we the readers get to enjoy vicariously a hike few of us will ever take through some of most amazing wilderness in the US. We understood her loneliness without the constant references to her need to fill that hole with sex. It may sell more books but I think it cheapened the well written story.
0515153656|5.0|I read this one out of order.  I needed to find out what happened to Reacher's brother and this was a great book.  Having read the 2-4 books first I probably knew before I was supposed to what happened to Joe but I loved the book as I have all of the books so far in the Reacher series
B0002HY24Q|4.0|Wish size was more clearly marked in description.  Good detail, very realistic; wanted a larger model.  I'm using it for a school demo.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|I use this for typing papers and taking notes in my high school classes and I have tried many different ones and this has been the best one I have used
B00B1D6YZ0|4.0|Very well painted, detailed. I'm using it for school demo.  Size should be clearly indicated in description.  Would buy another.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I babysit a 4yr old and he absolutely loves this game. He's getting pretty good at it. His reflexes and reaction times are improving a great deal. Excellent hand/eye control exercise for anyone.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|a short, easy read but a little too much in fantasy land for me.  However, it may appeal to some.
0230757650|5.0|This is my child's favorite book! The noises are great and fun! I totally recommend this book!!;)the noises are very real!
B0091REZMW|4.0|you can't be informative and entertaining?<br />How about a little action? If it makes sense, cut to the product in use as you describe your experiences with it. But in all addictive
B008M721MS|1.0|This app works fine the first time or two you use it, then the screen keeps freezing the audio goes mute, and it's just a piece of cheap.
B007XF4J66|5.0|Casablanca meet all my expectations. I like the characters, actors, music and of cuorse main actors. The movie is an inspiration to courage and independency.
B00F5FEZTC|5.0|Saw Elton on Ellen and audience received a free copy.  Was impressed because it is the Elton John as we knew him prior to the most recent works dedicated to animated films.  The real Elton John is back in this new album. Reminds me of Madman Across the Water and other early works.  Still making magic with his fingers on the ebony and ivory keys of the piano, you know it's Elton even if you have just heard the song for the first time
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have been lost in this book since I opened it. It brought me to places that no-one should surrender to.
B005D0RDIE|4.0|I thought the camera views were great,but the sound was'nt as good.Still I enjoyed the program.Would recommend for any RUSH Fan's Library.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book was so much better than I anticipated. I originally bought the abridged audio book. Then, wanted to learn more and ended up buying the book. I learned more about the mountain people of Afghanistan in a single book than five years of watching the news. Amazing story of survival against the odds!
B00BOUL9DM|4.0|This is good fun for adults and kids. Very young children may not enjoy it as much if they don't have a strong vocabulary well beyond what would be considered normal for their age.
B00ESY77LO|5.0|Leo is always great. The colors were amazing. Definitely will get the blu-ray!!!! Good date night movie. Did I mention I love Leo??!!! :-)
B000VS6R26|1.0|This DVD was not the same one that was originally ordered and this one has problems with skipping as well.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|There really isn't too much to say other than it's a great show. I recommend everyone watch the walking dead you can become addicted to it like me.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very intense read.  I'm usually good at figuring out the endings of books but this one surprised me!! A very good read!!
B009W7TTHC|5.0|Tom cruise does a fantastic job here<br />As a hit man he is very good gettin j fox to help him in his mission
B008Y212PI|4.0|Great game. Excellent tutorial. Challenging and easy to learn. Wish there were more pictures as I've almost burned through them all.
B00633W614|5.0|Love this author's breezy compelling style.  Keeps me coming back for more. I couldn't sleep one night, hadn't been able to get the book from my library, hard copy or on my kindle, so I pulled the trigger and ordered it right then.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|I can't figure out how to play it.  I don't want to play against people that I don't know.  I don't like Social games
B00DPH7QFM|2.0|This would be a fine product if only the mix wasn't so terrible. Some inept or unqualifed undividual was allowed to mix this and he left the guitar and vocals way too loud. Mr. Blackmore remains my favorite guitar player ever and he is probably brilliant here IF HEARD WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE BAND. Knowing Blackmore the band most cetainly played well and the guitar noise on this DVD would be music if I could here what it was set to. Borrow this or listen on line if you are curious. Did anybody even bother to check the quality of this before it was released? If this is &#34;archival material&#34; that couldn't be fixed then that is how this should have been marketed. Joel R. Tambling
B0053ZOQMK|3.0|My 4 year old and I liked it okay, but had a hard time staying interested in it. It seemed to kind of move slowly. The graphics were great, though, and we loved all the animals!!
B004QKNXIQ|4.0|This great dressing-up of Cinderella was wonderful. The characters were hilarious, the setting amazing, and the plot great. I could have done without the music montages, but I guess it wouldn't be a Disney film without them.
148113373X|5.0|His previous work &#34;Heretics&#34; was interesting and his take on the foibles of the leading intellectual figures of the time was telling. However,&#34;Orthodoxy&#34; is both confusing and extremely rich. The first time that I read it I was complexed. Then, I read it again with a pen which I hadn't done in years. The volume came to life and I proceeded to again read it with a pen.<br />I am now chewing through it a fourth time.<br />It is not only for Christian believers, but has intensely valuable insights into all of human nature. As well being in many intenses profoundly humerous.<br /><br />PS
B00BEIYMTW|2.0|Great animation, dismal characters and plot (one-third of the Lasseter trifecta).  Disney studios should have released this movie direct-to-DVD, and even then it would have deserved maybe three stars (Mater Toons is far more entertaining).  Only reason it doesn't get one star is that most of the kids (at least the ones who didn't fall asleep) seemed to enjoy the movie (but again, kids' taste can be fairly indiscriminate).
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I only wish we could actually watch it here in the U.S. in September like everyone in the U.K.  Love the show.  Also love knowing the castle is a real place.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was a real page turner, but I was disappointed the way it ended. The characters were interesting, and like able
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|I always look for Baz Luhrman to do something very unique.  This is a wonderful production--all the glamour, all the glitz of the time period, plus a little updating w/the score.  Also, the story of course--a classic.  A great representation of the period, plus a lesson for all of us.  Funny, some things and people don't change.
B009346RSS|4.0|I don't have comparison of how good the sound quality is, but it didn't suck and it worked easy, so not a bad piece.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|I have never read a murder mystery before but after the action started to happen I couldn't put this book down. This was not only beautifully written, but we'll thought out and quite frankly one of my favorite books I've ever read. I'm astounded by the ending and the attention to detail that Agatha Christie put into writing this novel.
B00EB6ENXO|3.0|Not quite what I was expecting had one exciting moment that was it. Purchase it because it was filmed in my hometown wish I had rented it
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|It was a excellent film. I saw it in theaters. A great product to own am proud of the service.
B00DHHWY9I|5.0|Probably too many people compared it to the previous film.  I am a huge fan of Leonardo DeCaprio and the intensity he portrays...so I enjoyed the movie tremendously, particularly seeing it in 3D helped.  Other actors did a fantastic job also.  Music score diffferent, but also enjoyable.  Even though a great classic story, I'm still amazed at the shallowness, self-centered lives of the individuals.
B002QGSYRC|5.0|This is an excellent book about a fascinating subject- the Korean War- that has relevancy today. Halberstam's style brings all of the background to the war as compelling stories. The battle stories are compelling. He strikes a good balance between history and stories. Definitely worth a read as is all of his books.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|Couldn't wait  to get this and play it--I'm a big Cher fan and these are all new songs. You won't be disappointed.
B009NH6JRE|5.0|I started watching The Walking Dead on Netflix last year. I was hooked! I have since bought every season on Blu-ray & am very addicted to the show. If you like suspense, action and watching people fight for their lives, then this is the show for you!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent acting... It's a love story as well. Aristocrats in a great storyline and time period in history.<br />Characters have depth.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It starts out easy but then it gets harder. Just enough to make you stop and think of another way
B001ILFUD2|5.0|Daughter wanted for her collection of animated films!! Now I just have to fill in some more space for a computer!!
B00EP22QKG|5.0|I have been a fan of Joan Jett since the Runaway's when I had a crush on all of them. I'm happy to say that Joan Jett and the Black Hearts have not lost sight on what makes Rock & Roll, Rock & Roll.
B004478AS4|1.0|Bought this for assignment, because needed to be able to search for passages on my Kindle and the search options isn't working!! Not Indexed!!
B00B23O96A|2.0|I was very disappointed in the type of music on the cd.  I expected some blues music and did get it.
B00705GEO4|5.0|I have been reading about Sabaton for a couple of years, but this was my first CD of theirs I have purchased. I have really enjoyed it and plan to purchase more of their catalog. If you are a fan of power, symphonic, progressive metal, give this one a try.
B001XVD2Z0|5.0|Required viewing for the 20th century. This ushered in a new era of sci-fi films. There's no excuse not to have seen it.
B00BURWSHA|5.0|I have been a fan of Doug Aldrich for years. I saw him on That Metal Show and heard him talking about this CD. I bought it without hearing any of it.  I was pleasantly surprised. They even do a cover of Led Zeppelin's Kashmir.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Going to take a trip.  Did not want to risk taking my normal laptop.  This is great that now I can check email on the road and do what I want to do directly on Kindle Fire.
B0036TGT2A|4.0|I absolutely love Disney movies and have purchased nearly every one for my family over the last 11 years. I loved the disc art and wasn't too happy when they took that away in favor of the blue and white discs for blu-rays and silver for the dvds. With the dvds it's especially difficult to see the names of the movies.<br /><br />Since we have so many and we travel so much I put my movies in binders so it's easily portable. Now most of our blurays look the same and it's really boring.<br /><br />They've also stopped giving out discs for digital copies and now we have to download the movies from iTunes. It used to take a few minutes to transfer the movie to iTunes, now it takes hours.<br /><br />I do love this movie I just wish the discs were more decorative and contained a digital copy disc.<br /><br />Of course I give the movie 5 stars
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I never really paid much attention when this book made such a sensational debut. Then there were headlines about how people were using the social media to get the filmmakers to recast actors in the upcoming movie based on the book, so I decided to see what was the whole fuss was about.<br /><br />I realize this is supposed to be some &#34;mommy porn&#34; so I can't expect intellectual curiosity to be satisfied. But the book didn't hold my attention especially after I found out it's about some sociopath's dominance over a co-dependent.<br /><br />I really don't get why people think this is a great book. Seems like it's marketed towards people with low self-esteem. I won't read the rest of the trilogy.
140053271X|5.0|I never thought I would want to give up my tangible books for an eBook but I have really enjoyed having the book although I still break down and buy a hardcover now and then for my library.  I feel good about saving our landfills.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This is the kind of book you'll want to read straight through, but if you really want to test it out -- don't. Take the time to do each little experiment as you go to really get the maximum benefit. I found this book to be an easy read, engaging, funny and not bogged down in a lot of technical double speak that can make some books of this type so confusing. The experiments are easy to do -- some quicker than others. There was at least one that I had to do over after I figured out why it didn't work the way it said it would. Once I got it straight it did, like all the other experiments -- WORK! If you're a skeptic, all the better. when I did the first experiment, which takes 48 hours, I was right down to the last minutes with no dice. I had just said to myself -- oh well -- so much for that -- when not only did I get what the experiment promised, I got it like a ton of bricks. I tend to be a little obtuse and wondered whether I'd even recognize the outcome if it happened, but there was no chance of missing it. None at all. I recommend this book highly to anyone who is wondering what's &#34;out there&#34; and whether we can use it to create positive change in our day to day lives. It's a good read for anyone who comes from a background that demands proof instead of fluff.This book turns that old saying &#34;seeing is believing&#34; on its head and shows that it really should be &#34;Believing is seeing.&#34; Happy reading and  may the Force be with you!
B008Y212PI|5.0|Got this as the free app of the day but would pay the full amount. Looked confusing but it has been wonderful tutorial!
B002I8PVQA|5.0|This movie showcased the very talented acting of my now favorite actor Ed Norton. Bravo! See it and enjoy and enjoy.
0761169253|4.0|Kleon,  has done a good job at creatively telling the artist how to steal.  No matter what your art forte may be.
0316247545|5.0|My daughter just turned 7 and I try to encourage as much reading as possible. She is really enjoying it. It's really cute. I love the song lyrics in the back. She doesn't feel pressured to read the whole thing and can just pick a short story to read each evening. I even caught her with a flashlight the other night!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I was distraught. I couldn't eat. I couldn't sleep. I started to lose my hair.... the fact that I couldn't watch Miley Cyrus's Wrecking ball Vevo music video on the full span of my television screen was causing my life to fall to pieces. Then, like a kiss from an angel, Google started shipping the Google Chromecast, and for only $35. The device was really easy to set up, and the packaging was ascetically pleasing. After a quick install on my computer, I was up and running watching Vevo videos on my TV. Soon after my appetite returned and I had a head of hear that would make Uncle Jessie jealous. If you are looking for a simple way to get Youtube and Netflix on your TV then this is the product for you.
B0009ZHJ7S|1.0|I loved the &#34;Ice Age&#34; series (three of them) and the promo on robots looked interesting so I bought it, but frankly left me a llittle flat.
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|If you love music themed movies, humor, an English countryside setting and Maggie Smith, then I believe you'll enjoy Quartet. I also enjoyed the fact that actual retirement age musicians and professional singers actually were included in the retirement home.
B0000AUHOH|5.0|I read what others said about Star Trek V, and frankly I think some people are 'hyper critical' just to get a 'rise' out of others.  If you are a true star trek fan you will enjoy this movie.  Just sit back in your easy chair and 'chill out'!
B000000OQF|5.0|Argurably GNR's best album ever. I love unique voices and Axle has one. These guys rock! To bad they fell apart.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Great movie. Finally something different from Hollywood! Keeps you guessing with a few goid twists thrown in here and there.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|These people are REAL musicians. They not only know how to play their instruments but they know how to write lyrics that cut to the bone
B00B4Z5J92|3.0|I like Sound city, because it let me see where most of my childhood music was produced at.  But then I had to turn it off when it became the Dave Grohl project!
B0063IH60K|1.0|Good as far as solitair goes. There are way to many adds, as many as 2 adds per game regularly apear. Kinda pisses me off..
076244911X|5.0|Not too much text, but enough to be informative. I like fashion books to be about the clothes (not a 'cerebral' experience), and this fits the bill.
B00EB6F1TY|4.0|Great movie, the bonus features are great, it came on time, the packaging it was in was a bit questionable because it wasn't in a normal amazon box but rather a padded envelope but it came in perfect condition and it's fantastic.
B0015AARJI|4.0|I find the dualshock  3 to be comfortable and responsive.  I like the symmetrical layout as opposed to having the two sticks be in different places.  Only a couple of minor downsides.  I have large hands, and so the controller sometimes feels undersized in my hand.  Not a big deal, but it is noticeable compared to, say, a 360 controller.  Second, the triggers aren't very well designed.  They need to be angled out, not in so that your finger won't tend to slip off.  Fortunately, there are aftermarket trigger covers that solve this problem.
B005GY0Y8S|2.0|The entire story and style of writing.  Characters are not impressive. at times. events confusing.<br />I have not recommended to friends.
B00DWFQ2TI|2.0|I don't care for this CD as others in the past. Must admit have not heard the whole album as yet cause first 3 songs all have the same beat and all 3 sound the same.  Doesn't have originality.  Very disappointing from Justin this time.
B004U8VWLE|4.0|I is good about stress that stars go through to be at the top of there profession. I like the movie and I like Natalie Portman as actress
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Can't put it down.  Characters you will fall in love with. I am Learning history without knowing it. Thanks Diana
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Enjoy each new level.  Fun Fun Fun!!  New little birds are fun.  Rarely play regular Angry Birds since I have this one.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Can't put it down.  Characters you will fall in love with. I am Learning history without knowing it. Thanks Diana
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can not wait for the new season to begin.  Would be nice if there was a bit more romance and a lot less tragic moments, like the end of season 3!  WOW
0345505387|3.0|It was hard to tell the male characters apart, all muscular, bearded and wearing tartan and many with shades of red hair.<br />Interesting to see the story from another point of view, but not enough detail was available in this format.
1476734941|5.0|Upon reading the book, it was the best diet info I have ever read. I have tried numerous of Diets.<br />Cabbage,<br />Protein<br />Fruit & Vegetables<br />None, have have ben as easy to follow as this Fast Diet. I am not hungry on the two fast days. I can eat what I want<br />on the othe five days./ Also, I am able to walk my hour on fast days without feeling week.
B00CFO7PK2|3.0|I really enjoyed hearing Buika being introduced on N.P.R. Her personality was engaging and her history interesting. I purchased the album with enthusiasm but it didn't &#34;move&#34; me.  I guess I prefer  more of a latin beat....but, I still do like Buika and would like to hear more of her.
B009VLXMJA|5.0|awesome record. if you are a big swift fan then this is the right record for you.  i would reccomend this to everyone.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I just love this book, once i start it up i wasn't able to stop reading!<br />Really recommend this book to all fantasy readers.<br />Already started reading the Day two(the wise man's fear) and so far is also great<br />A great saga to read.
B00428CCPW|5.0|loved listening to this album. great track listing, anyone who is a big swift fan then this is the right album for you.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|A must have for any Go Pro owner! Instant playback and aiming when using it to stand alone. Worth the money.
B000VZBCWE|5.0|loved watching this masterpiece dvd this was queen and freddy mercury at their best. i would reccomend to all queen fans.
B008CPZNL6|3.0|I am still in the learning faze, but it seems too much of a good thing.  But in time I might change my mind.
B002NJWHHA|2.0|My son who has read the novels was not impressed with the movie version ... so thumbs down from a 9 year old who read the books. Stick with the books.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The challenge level here is a little low, but sufficient to keep me interested. I also like how there is one room at a time, rather than one long elaborate single escape to perform.
B0089LT8Y6|5.0|Never really got into Testament the first time around - I am more of an Anthrax / Megadeth guy. But saw them open for Anthrax recently and was impressed -- then heard this and was sold. My biggest problem with the earlier stuff is the production quality -- to me they can sound too \\"mid-rangy\\" -- since getting this record and Formation of Damnation (they both have GREAT production) I have been going back and appreciating the overlooked qualities in the earlier stuff. If you are new to Testament, I would recommend this record, which I think is the best they have done. Formation of Damnation next, with has similar production, then the rest -- starting with the New Order I would say. IMHO
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|The bad: Battles are a little repetitive, and the break system builds too slowly.<br /><br />The good: Everything else. Also, the battles do have an &#34;auto&#34; function, which makes them less of a pain to get through. Also, as the game progresses, you can find a bit more of a challenge in the fights.
B000IJ79WU|3.0|I really do not think it held up over time. Re watched this after many years with my 9 year old and he was mildly entertained. The new comic movies way out do this.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|I've been reading a lot of YA lit lately because I've been writing it. I was pleasantly surprised as my wife and I read this to one another over a long road trip. It's well written, well-plotted, and I liked the characters.
B00ERQOU9U|3.0|It is an interesting read but really slows down in the middle. I will finish this book but it's taking a bit
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|Lois Lowry's well worn little book is an important read for young readers and their parents. I came to it at 60, and I'm glad I did.
B00B6CUO6Q|5.0|Can't wait for new season, will miss Mathew - actors are great at their craft - always wondering what will happen next - hope it is not to Mr. Bates
8866135909|5.0|I love moleskine products, which is why I searched for this planner to begin with. But it shipped incredibly fast and was in brand new condition. Great service, thanks!
B00116FT6M|4.0|It is still good nonetheless. Seriously, I'm a straight manly man and I liked it. Not loved it, but liked it, so I guess that deserves a 4/5.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|If you are a fan of the show, then there's really not much to say, as you already know that season 3 was fantastic!  In regards to the actual product... it's exactly as expected.  No issues here.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|It seems Iron Man 3 received a lot of hate from fans and casual movie-goers alike, but from an objective standpoint: Yes, there were a lot of plot holes and the Iron Man suits kept falling apart whereas it was practically indestructible in the first 2 movies and in the Avengers movie. However, like Tony Stark repeatedly says throughout the movie, \\"I am Iron Man\\". The suits are just suits, the actual superhero is the person and this movie is about Tony Stark. With that in mind, it does develop his character more and introduces Extremis. It doesn't quite follow the comic books, and I am not sure if he is injected with Extremis at the end. I just know that I am more anxious to see the Avengers sequel and Iron Man 4.<br /><br />Overall: 4/5 stars. If you liked the first 2 Iron Man movies and the Avengers, I highly recommend watching Iron Man 3. There's no AC/DC and Tony Stark is less stylish/flashy in this one, it is mainly about his vulnerabilities and how he overcomes it.
0316201545|5.0|My ten year old daughter could not put the book down...and now Chris Colfer is her new 'BEST' author and she can't wait for his next book!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book!  Katniss and Peeta carry us through an adventure we never could have imagined, I was in shock all throughout.
B00CATONCA|5.0|This special edition boxed set is as awesome ! Just got mine and after assembled it looks incredible. The box of dvds goes in the back of the tanks and is so tight you cant get it back out without struggling a little.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|There is so much going on in the game the time just flies by. I saw my grandson playing the game and had to get it.<br />R, for myself.
0545265355|4.0|I would mock this series when I found out it was essentially a cross between Battle Royale and Twilight. But when I saw the movie, it had a strange effect on me. It made me really curious about this world of Panem. So I decided to buy the trilogy and give them a read, see how they compare to the movie.<br /><br />I think the film is a superior product compared to the first book, mostly because it mercifully removed the long scenes where Peeta and Katniss cuddled in the cave. Other than that, reading the book really gives a new context to the subtleties of the film, thus giving it added value.<br /><br />My only complaints about these books is that, yes, they are very obviously geared towards young kids (girls, in particular) who are entertained by love triangles and \\"feeling confused\\" about boys. But the scenes of violence, defiance and the dramatic beats are wonderfully written, really engaging the reader.<br /><br />I look forward to seeing how they continue to bring this series to life in film form.
0439023513|5.0|I love it...now I have the trilogy and read the all.  What a great story.  Would recommend to anyone.  .....
B0064MGU98|5.0|Excellent script and story lines...compelling! I discovered this series in its third season on an airplane's in-flight tv programming and was thrilled to discover it on amazon and be able to start with the first season and watch all the seasons.
0545586178|5.0|Was a great read.  Loved the concept.  Cat wait to see the movie.  Enjoy every page and will read again.
B00E8JZILA|5.0|I haven't ever played a game that impacted me emotionally the way that The Walking Dead has. Minor graphical and audio hiccups here and there never pulled me from the world I was so deeply immersed in. The whole game is a roller coaster of emotion and Moody atmosphere. I laughed a little here and there, but a lot of the time I was choked up by the brutally sad story of people trying to survive encounters with other survivors. Clementine became like my own daughter and I tried to be nothing less than a saint in her eyes. I walked away feeling like I did what I could, no more and no less. This may just be the most realistic psychoanalysis and test of character I've ever witnessed. I taught a little 8 year old girl to shoot walkers in the head, and felt bad watching her get used to this apocalyptic reality, though it was clearly a necessary survival skill. I killed a man's son because I could never force a man to kill his own child. I choked up every time a member of the group was left behind. I did things that are completely out of my character because I knew these things had to be done in the dog eat dog world so lovingly crafted by the people over at Telltale Games. This game crushed me like a ton of bricks, but in the best of ways. Finally a real survival horror game that breaks the monotonous cycle of repetitive resident evils and dead spaces. Favorite PSVita game yet.
B00DY951RQ|5.0|Great stuff musically with the Bromberg,Kooper,Dylan studio stuff from SP and some of the NM things. Anything Dylan And Happy Traum did together is gold. Same for Leon. Only thing that really bugs me about this package (and anything he's involved with) is Greil Marcus. What is this s***e?
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|If you are seeking a nice enjoyable read this is your next book. Keeps you connected all the way through.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|Good zombie movie.  Would recommend if you like action movies, apocoplyse, and outbreak movies.  Sets up for a sequel. Zombie.
B006S8QY8K|4.0|I usually like any movie that Stanley Tucci is in - what an adorable guy.  Okay, in this movie Gere plays an executive who is going home to the Chicago suburbs on the L train and he sees a dance class in a window.  He's feeling life is getting too routine, so he does something risky and admirable.  I love movies like these.  He gets out of his rut and he takes a dance class.  Of course his wife, played by Sarandon (who was in my Starbucks a couple of years ago) suspects the worst: her husband is having an affair.<br /><br />How he and his family come to terms with his new hobby and the changes he's making, and how he learns to dance, is a pretty enchanting tale.  It's an upbeat, buoyant movie with some charm.  Would recommend it to anyone who likes movies with dancing in them, or like these actors or the premise of the movie.
B00A0MJ9VY|5.0|Great dvd the price is acceptable when you are collecting disney dvds. I will buy more when needed. Nice condition
B00ECLTYOG|5.0|My husband is such a hangover freak. So he can't get enough of this movie. Plus it's super funny and enjoyable
B008K9UZY4|5.0|This is my second favorite Sonic game ever (Sonic Adventure 2 Battle is my favorite) the only things I don't  like about this game is that you have to unlock the extras and the U.S. boss music is freaking scary!!!!!!
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|Have been listening to Buddy for a while. Actually I heard &#34;Evil Twin&#34; on the Blues program and wanted to hear more. Of course I sampled the album and purchased it (probably would have without the sample).
B004QX07G4|5.0|Hysterical, charming, inspiring and fun. I wish it went on and on! Looking forward to her next book. Is she writing another book ;)
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A new twist around every corner. Held my interest right to the end.  Really enjoyed this book and all the characters.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This was an awesome story line. The filimg was absolutely stunning! I was on the edge of my chair at times. I have watched this DVD now 3 times!  ;-)
159463176X|5.0|Once you've read a Khaled Hosseini book you'll know that you just have to buy the next one as it hits the shelf.  And the Mountains Echoed was not a disappointment.  It was so beautifully written, with such passion and so much emotion, portraying peoples lives and how intertwined they can become.  I absolutely recommend this book!  5 stars for Mr Hosseini!!
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|Cute movie..... A great way to escape for a couple of hours on a rainy day. Cast is also great
B0065GC0BA|4.0|I started reading this book with no idea as to the plot or the story line.  It was one of our book club books and instead of me reading reviews to see what it was about and what other people thought, I thought I'd just get stuck in!  What a beautiful love story.  A beautiful, sad story!
B00ESY77LO|4.0|I've never read the book so i had  no clue what this movie was about. It was odd at first  but it  turned out to be a decent movie.
B00DHNB5CY|5.0|Outstanding production. Kept with feel and humor of some of the old B movies, but obvious that there was more money able to be added to the production.
B002GHHHPQ|5.0|Good story and good acting.  This is one of many excellent movies about the &#34;Greatest Generation&#34; and the sacrifices they made during WW2.
B00DWFQ2N4|3.0|Justin Timberlake has a great voice and doesn't need help from these sound-tweaks.  And the music seems to be all manufactured in the background.  Not at all what I expected - masked by electronics.  Should be two stars, but he is a great performer. What happened?
B000MD9UJC|5.0|I'd give this product a &#34;TEN&#34; rating if possible!  I needed a new one because I've worn one of these out!  Took about six years of constant use, two of those were during the remodeling of my Daughter's house.  The flashlight was dropped from varying heights some drops were on concrete from 8 to 10 feet, stepped on, dropped into the engine compartment of two or three vehicles.  This flashlight was abused in more ways than I have room here to tell about.  Finally the first Nite Ize just gave up the ghost!  Mag-Lite still worked so in went another Nite Ize and we'll see how long this one lasts.
B005HHSYMW|4.0|have not read the whole book by any means. It is easy to read. IT is good to gets some solid quantitative data about levels of violence. His focus is on the number of violent deaths, which is totally understandable, but I wonder if missing the more subtle froms of violence that abound today might skew things a bit. Does economic and structural domination mean that overt physical forms of violent are not as necessary today for aggressors to achieve their aims.
B006C45MRE|5.0|First impression is the plot should be weak, but then it really picks up. Aliens are totally possible and the show works well.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I gave it 5 stars because the story flows very well and keeps you wanting to know what is next. It is a very realistic telling of the struggle of people who's world was destroyed by manipulating and controlling governments.
0446310786|5.0|I was familiar with the movie, and I had always heard that the writing was wonderful, but I had just never gotten around to reading it for myself until now.  I found that it lived up to all the praise.  The characters are fully drawn, and the descriptions of the town are honest and detailed.  The narrator is somehow a child and an adult all at the same time.  The ending is haunting.
1451695195|5.0|Appreciated the quality of the writing of the book.  Cannot question the facts coming from a Neurosurgeon's own personal experience.  It is probably the most uplifting book that I have ever encountered.  So pleased that Dr. Eben Alexander felt compelled to share his personal experience with us!!!!
B001UV4XIS|3.0|I bought this to complete our collection of the movie series.  As any fan will tell you, the first three movies were pretty good, but they went downhill compared to the books after that.  What a shame they actually divided the seventh book into two movies. . .and STILL messed it up!  Why change Neville's excellent challenge of Voldemort for the wimpy drivel offered in the movie?  And why cut the excellent duel/verbal exchange between Harry and Tom Riddle for the bizarre wrestling match they put in?  If you've enjoyed the movies at all, do yourself a favor and READ THE BOOKS!  They're amazing!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app is the best Facebook app there is.  It is easy to use and navigate on mobile devices, especially on the Kindle Fire.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I didnt want to like this so much. I had preconceived ideas of the PLAY- BUT this is excellant, a must see; Each actor is marvleous and draws you in as they do it all. Can't say enough good about. Everyone or anyone that appreciates a story of forgiveness and redemption should see. In fact I'll go further and say everyone should see, whether they appreciate or not, perhaps it would do our society some good to have all watch.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|At first I refused to be a follower of the Hunger Game craze but then the movie came out on DVD and I watched it.  I fell in love so I had to read the trilogy.  I am so glad that I did.  We now teach the Hunger Games trilogy in our Language Arts classes at our high school.  These books appeal to readers of all ages!
B005OCFHHK|5.0|This is the best buy for the entire collection that I have found.  Does not have DVD or Digital copies to play in the car for the kids, but, that's cool.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great writing, great plot and great acting make this series so much fun to watch.  I highly recommend watching all three seasons and cannot wait for the 4th to start in January.
B00BS3EMNY|5.0|Love the cd, songs are catchy, and it is just as good, maybe better than some from her last album.
B0045HCJRG|5.0|Love this movie!  Funny, sweet, with innocence and good morals against decadence. Great family movie!  I have seen this movie many times and it always makes me laugh.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Good presentation, large buttons, and all the functions I need presented in a User friendly way makes this my calculator of choice.  Along with a dictionary, it is one of my indispensable go to apps.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|cause I lost my tv remote. But the chromecast lets your phone be the remote which is wicked cool. So now I no longer need to get off my ass to change the channel or whatever. Just tap tap tap on the phone screen and voila: TV coma for hours.
1781162646|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. Not quite like his earlier books. As usual, he gets you involved with his characters early on and just spins a great yarn from there. Highly recommended. Good read.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|My comments are more on the show rather then the quality of the disks and such.  As for the show I started watching these going back and forth between north america and singapore.  I got hooked so fast that I went out and got all the seasons pretty much instantly and banged them all out in like a month.<br /><br />Great show, I think everyone of has a little Walter White (Heizenberg) in us.
B008Y212PI|5.0|FAOTD was really fun to play &amp; worked well on S4 without any problems and I will definitely purchase some of the others having played this.
B006ISJQ3K|1.0|I thought this would be greatest hits it has about 2 songs on it that fall in that category and this was way overpriced for the music on it unfortunately I opened it so I can't return it
B00A88FLI0|4.0|my sons love these things, they have more fun assembling it then playing with it after assembly , takes a licking
B000001E3V|5.0|One of my favorite long time albums, I recommend this to anyone who loves this group and I listen to it all the time.
0393327655|5.0|great read. assigned for class. normally something i wouldn't have picked on my own but happy to have been assigned it.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|its so much fun and my niece loves it. she cant stop playing. some of them she needs help on but she still loves it
B003O86FMW|5.0|I rated 5 stars because this book is unlike any book I've ever read and its the real deal!  I couldn't predict the ending and now am awaiting seeing the movie and finishing the series.  Awesome and well done.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This game is totally addicting. I just got it yesterday and have almost finished all the 5x5s. I would recommend it to anyone!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Love it.  Hated my phones texting till this was free app of the day.  All is good now. I swear this app knows what I am going to type before I end a sentence.
B002361MLA|5.0|Wonderful read with so much depth. Once you get it, you get it! Remember what your mother or father would ask you,\\"what does your conscience tell you.\\" God is in you and let it flow.Cancel the doubt and listen to your God voice. It's in you and you know it. Love
B008Y212PI|4.0|This is a wonderful game, I had a lot of fun playing it. The puzzles are a bit simple once you get the hang of them, but I liked to see what picture it would make next.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|It's a lot of fun to try to remember the smoking an  fun to guess  what you think it I  an  then fined out at the end
B008K8H9C6|5.0|Great game to introduce cause and effect and my son loves it for the game. Lots of levels to explore and I have fun helping out with some &#34;tricky&#34; parts
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I love this book, Tina Fey always makes me laugh. Its great to get some insight into her life and se how funny things always happen to her.
B00D2HTRVQ|5.0|I highly recommend all the dr panda games. My 2 and 4 yr old love to play them. You also high five the panda for a job well done which is super cute. Lots of exploring and learning opportunities
B000002MUW|4.0|The CD arrived on time, though the case of the CD is kind of bent. Hopefully we can change that next time.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Package arrived on time, well taken care of. Putting it up for future watching when the show is dead and gone. I love it.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I have always loved this movie and now I love it even more in 3-D.  Looking forward to finding the extended version in 3-D.
0345528581|4.0|This book provides the info I was looking for and more. Well worth the read. It's easy to pick and choose what you need to augment  your workout or to begin a new workout routine. Though I don't necessarily agree with all of the content it gave me what I wanted.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Perfect...The thing I like most is that the straps inside are adjustable so you can do your own compartments and can fit in more than one camera easily
B004L35GAQ|3.0|the cd is mainly electronica.... nothing like the one hit song sail on here... if you want that song just buy only the song. the rest of the cd is nothing like it!
B007DIQC90|5.0|Great title song and great recording. Unfortunately I cannot get the tune out of my head. Other than that<br />it is really a joy to listen to.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Much better than the first season. Lots of surprises. Always on the go. Carrie is up to her usual bi-polar tricks and always right. A must see.
B001DJLCRC|3.0|My 14 year old loves this show. I find the drug references crude and delivers the wrong message. Yes, life is hard, and that of a school teacher even more so on many levels, but to turn to illegal activities is not a good message to send our young generation. Just my humble opinion.
B008JFUR10|5.0|I really really like this movie. I see a lot of reviews complaining about the story is weak. Well folks this is a Kaiju film (Godzilla, Mothra, etc.). The Monsters and Destruction is what makes Kaiju's movies not Oscar winning dialogue. If you lames want a great story stick with Forest Gump or Sleepless in Seattle. For the people who want BIG MONSTERS and MASSIVE DESTRUCTION this is the movie for you. Highly recommended!!!!!
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Love this show. Seriously even my 5 year old laughs! The humor is advanced, the lines quick, the acting is brilliant. Seriously one of the best comedies that has intellect I have seen in years.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|The Name of the Wind was referred to me by a long time friend who is a writer.  I read through The Name of the Wind and immediately jumped into The Wise Man's Fear.  Then, I read them both again more carefully.  These are not small books and I took my time.  The story is so well crafted.  The characters are all believable and engaging.  The exploits of Kvothe are incredible at times but fit the story very well, as you are informed up front that it's the story of a legend.<br /><br />There are so few books (it seems) that are truly remarkable these days.  And, authors seem to churn out stories like so much sausage.  Lots of little parts thrown together then loosely wrapped for mass consumption.  This effort by Rothfuss is noteworthy because it is so carefully structured.  I can't imagine the notes, diagrams and sheer number of hours he invested in this story.  It's just ridiculously good.  There's no other way to say it:  Rothfuss has created a masterpiece.<br /><br />I am eager for the third installment, but I do not want it rushed.  This could be the next Lord of the Rings.  Yeah, it's that good.
B00DFBVKCS|5.0|This is great vinyl.Nothing like a piece of vinyl to put on the old platter and give it a spin. I like Vince Gill and I think this is one of hie better records. I also recommend purchasing anything by Vince and the Time Jumpers. Excellent western swing and some old Bob Wills songs. It don't get any better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0035LGXXO|4.0|After my friend and I caught a glimpse of the this film on TV we decided to watch the whole feature.  Amazon made this simple and easy to do and the movie was good as well.  It has action scenes that are of course fake but not extremely drawn out and over the top in other fighting based films.  The storyline was great and the outfits were even better.  I would definitely recommend this to someone who appreciates older movies and not &#34;how much CGI can I fit into 2hrs&#34; like we have today.
B0030DHPGQ|4.0|This would be a GREAT book.  The framework and essential ideas are a very helpful way to think about change.  However, they use a single metaphor and then carry it through the whole book.  If only they ad presented the metaphor and then left it alone.  I dislike the \\"elephant\\" and \\"rider\\" metaphor a lot - so it's constant use becomes annoying. I disagree with the premise that our \\"logical\\" mind is \\"supposed\\" to be able to override our emotional selves.  We aren't designed to be \\"ruled\\" by logic - we are designed to cooperate with ourselves.  We have internal checks and balances that work together to keep us safe. They eventually actually make the point that logic is actually designed to SERVE emotion, not rule it.  So why do they overemphasize this metaphor that doesn't even really portray their real point?  And then use it ad nauseum?  Why not just say that we must integrate and align our head, hearts, and bodies and work with the natural change process to get the best results.  Lots of other metaphors work to describe the inner leadership and collaboration required to change ourselves intentionally.<br /><br />Once I got past the metaphor - I discovered several great ideas and terms that have been helpful in teaching clients how to \\"lead\\" and facilitate their own personal growth and change initiatives instead of trying to control change.  Favorite ideas:<br /><br />- Look for the bright spots - learn from your own life.<br /><br /> Look for small examples where you are already doing what you want to do more of.  Look for what works and what doesn't, what helps and what doesn't.  I find all change efforts benefit greatly from focusing more on what *is* working than on what isn't working.  ALL the available feedback is helpful if is *descriptive* rather than *judged* as good or bad.  Feedback from what you do when you succeed can be used to redesign your strategy to fit you and your situation in areas where you are challenged. For example, if you are often late, focus on the bright spots - the examples of where you *are* on time.  How do you do that?  Use that to feed your creativity and design solutions for being on time more often. (I call this agilizing change.)<br /><br />- Love this quote \\" What looks like resistance is often a lack of clarity\\"<br /><br />YES!  Need to get small and specific.  I would also add that resistance is also often a sign of using strategies that don't fit the situation, the person, the timing, or the resources available. In my world resistance is incredibly valuable feedback for redesigning your approach and successfully leading change.<br /><br />- Love the languaging of \\"Shape\\" the path.<br /><br />You really can't \\"control\\" or \\"direct\\" change - if you work with the natural principles of how things and people organically change you will find that shaping is a far superior and more effective strategy.<br /><br />Overally, the model is a simple, straightforward framework that works better than most as a primer for people new to leading change.  I found that with a little tweaking and using my own metaphors (based on agile mindset, and iterative, organic, systems design thinking) I was able to enhance and simplify my own  Agilizen Designing for Change model making it easier to learn.<br /><br />This book is definitely worth reading by anyone who helps others change or is highly motivated to facilitate their own personal growth.us on the bright spots - the examples of where you *are* on time.

B00004UEDQ|5.0|Excellent movie to show when you have a substance abuse group who just needs a good laugh at the things they have done while abusing substances and in rehab.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was on the best seller list for so long so I bought it  I found it rather dull  except for the last few chapters not so interesting
B005XUC398|4.0|I thought it was a very entertaining movie.  Kevin Spacey is a good anchor for this movie.  He does a wonderful job along with other actors.
B005DOKL3E|4.0|It's good enough for what it is - just a way to keep my Kindle from getting scratched up inside my purse.  The price was right.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|Movie is beyond awesome!!! :) Definately a must see. The end of the movie Definately takes you by surprise. Keeps you at the edge of your seat
034580404X|5.0|I LOVVVVVED IT. EVERYTHING YOU COULD WANT IN A TRILOGY LEFT ME WANTING MORE. IS THERE GOING TO BE MORE?
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|As always, Stephen King gave us another great one!  Absolutely amazing read.  I could not put this book down, and definitely didn't want it to end.  Loved the characters and of course, good ole Dan.  Thanks Stephen, once again!
B000GCFG7E|5.0|One of the best Jack Reachers I've read. Put it on your Kindle and make your plane trips and airport layovers more pleasant.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Great book. Could not put it down. Whoever makes a movie according to it they better not mess up the book
B00181JGI2|5.0|I had not seen this great movie in over 10 years until just last week. Strange, weird and so funny. In the end you will think &#34;That Dude really had some strange thinking, but probably right). They don't make em like this anymore (nor before this either for that matter, lol). Let The Dude take you on this adventure. You will never be the same.
B003G4W49C|4.0|This shows how misperceptions can lead us down the incorrect road of life. Fear of the unknown can have dire consequences.
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|This movie is Top 25 movies of ALL time in my book. It has suspense, drama, comedy through out this marvelous Hitchcock Classic. I bought the Blu-Ray DVD and it is like watching this fantastic showing for the first time. Buy it now and enjoy North By Northwest!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The series is so great and season 3 kept me wishing season 4 was ready to purchase.  I can hardly wait for Jan. 2014 when I can purchase season 4.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book had me staying up until the wee hours of the morning, knowing that I had to work the next day. It will infuriate you, move you to tears, & make you laugh out loud. This is not the kind of book I would usually choose, but I highly recommend it! I could not put it down!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|PACKED FULL OF ACTION, AND THE STARS IN THE MOVIE WERE JUST GREAT!!<br />WOULD RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ALL MY FRIENDS!!
0812550706|5.0|One of the best sci fi books of all time... and it ages very well. The concepts presented age very well to today. I.e., if this were written right now instead of 27+ years ago you wouldn't know the difference.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone who enjoys Sci Fi, or just a good book in general.<br /><br />The only &#34;bad&#34; thing about it... like all good things... it comes to an end. You keep reading and reading and reading and inevitably.. you get to the end of the book... and you wish the book were a billion pages so you can just immerse yourself into the story that much longer. But at least there are many more books in the series, both after and before the events here.<br /><br />I regret every day I didn't read this book and I am eternally grateful for the days that I did.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Never heard of Rodriguez until I saw the movie &#34;Finding Sugarrman&#34;.  Interesting viewing if you are a fan.  Enjoying his music and better late than never ;-)
0810970686|4.0|The first thing I noticed was that I had ordered a paperback copy, and I received a hardcover copy. They didn't charge me extra, but it definitely caught me off guard. I received it on the day it was estimated, so a rather long wait. I hadn't read it yet and I expected it to be as good as the others, but it wasn't really. I suggest borrowing it from the library before buying it to make sure you actually like it.<br /><br />Rating: 75/100<br /><br />The book was in good condition, just the issues stated above are the only REAL problem I had.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Never heard of Rodriguez until I saw the movie &#34;Finding Sugarman&#34;.  Interesting viewing if you are a fan.  Enjoying his music and better late than never ;-)
0446310786|5.0|Great book my daughter found it to be very interesting and helpful for school project.Now looking into buying more books by Harper Lee.
B00AF6MF9I|2.0|This game is a fun game but I would have too say the only bad part is there upkeep I have had lots of lag like I would get my money from my places and put out my fire's from my friend's and spend 2 hour doing so just too have everything go back like I did nothing if they keep up on everything and made it glitch free this game would be one of the beast army games out there and would give it 5stare
B00AEBBADG|5.0|Grand movie for its time!<br />love all the different gangs! The furries are my fav after the warriors!<br />Its probably due to the fact that i love there war paint/face painting!<br /><br />Awesome!
B00AFROVQC|3.0|This is epic fantasy which doesn't always fit in one book, but that said this should have had some kind of satisfying conclusion, along the lines of The Ranger's Apprentice (That is a well-written series). It didn't.  It just leaves the story in mid air.  There are many improbable and stupid things in story.  A young woman sitting on the ground in white satin?  Does the author know anything about young women or satin?  The main character and his friend roaming through a dark passage talking about how important it was to do it in pitch darkness and then talk about seeing each other's facial expressions?  Too much happened too quickly and everything was extreme right away.  Falling in love instantly...  Instant deep friendships...  Instant enemies...  Knowing an animal is trying to communicate with you and feeling an INSTANT bond with it.  Taking care of an infant wild animal and not mentioning how much care it would need and treating it as a domesticated animal?  All these inconsistencies were annoying and distracting.  He talked about how important it was for those in the legion not to lose a sword but when he loses his sword no one mentions it?  It felt somewhat half-baked.  All that said, the story was interesting and I liked the characters.  I tried to tell myself that this is more a fairytale and all the holes don't matter, but it isn't great writing.  Too hurried, not enough editing or re-writing. All that said, I still bought the next one.....  Not sure what that says about me, but this is nothing like Patrick Rothfuss or Jordan or Rowling more like fairy tales in the Blue fairy book.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Being a Trek fan for many years I've enjoyed all the Star Trek TV shows, motion pictures, various cast members, and this one was no different.  I can't go into much detail regarding this particular film for those who haven't see it yet.  I'll just say I loved this one and no one could pry me out of the chair the first time I watched it.  I hope other Trekkers like this as much as I do.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|Not as good as the first, but worth sitting down to watch. I do, however, fear this will be the last we see of Downey as Iron Man. :(
B00847KFDS|5.0|I like everything by John Fogerty. He is a living legend and a survivor from the early days.<br />This is great 'traveling music'.
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|It was action packed! But I maybe needed more of a story line not sure if the more back ground would have helped.
B008OJ291W|2.0|My bad.  I didn't read all the reviews like I should have.  Buyer beware.  If you are looking for the ORIGINAL, radio played versions of these songs look elsewhere!  These are all remakes by Jeff Lynne and ONLY him.  No other vocals.
1451695195|5.0|I actually purchased this book for my BIL and decided to read it myself first.  I wasn't really interested in reading it because I have no doubt that God and the afterlife exists and I read Mooney's book Life after Lfe many years ago.  There were some interesting medical analysis in this book that I found enlightening. Also, it sort of &#34;put me on track&#34; again. Good read. Great info.!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Awesome!  So glad I ordered this. It came promptly and as always no problems. Can't wait to finish watching this one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I never read books over and over this one I do!!! Great book the whole series is. Love love love.
B0046B6X1E|3.0|This movie is a very slow starter.  There was a lack of meaningful dialogue. The last third of the movie gets more exciting but leaves you somewhat dissatisfied with the conclusion.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie.  My family is also enjoying the movie as we do share we purchase DVDs.  Done
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Hard to compare a phone game with the original, that seemed to require involvement of both hands/arms. I haven't seen the ads mentioned by others yet.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I am a Star Trek fan.  I like the new Star Trek crew and enjoyed watching both this DVD and the last one.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Except for some sexual lyric contents, the beats just keep me shake my body, or shall I say my booty?
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Captivating coverage of a brilliant legacy; a page turner! An in depth understanding of the Apple evolution and Jobs energy and innovations.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I love it.  My son is 7 years old and he likes to play this game all the time at home.
B004GYY714|4.0|TuneIn is a pretty good app. One can select online radio from all over the world. More important, many that I tried actually worked quite well on my Android phone even when I am driving.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Great game. The puzzles never become repetitive, and there is a story behind the quest grid. It's a well liked game by all family members. My youngest likes the pipes puzzles best.
B004RJMUJO|2.0|I have played it several times.  It is not my favorite but have done it frequently.  My grandson liked it because it was Ninja and was able to whack the fruit..
B001HN6922|5.0|This was a great movie and it was in great shape when I got it.  It came in a timely manner and is great for any age.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Enjoy the puzzles. Gave 4 stars because I would like to be able to move to the next puzzle quicker.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|The movie is great for all ages and the DVD came in good shape so I gave it 5 stars.
0321934318|5.0|A great how-to manual for anyone learning how to use Lightroom. Scott Kelby never disappoints! He has several other manuals too.
1451626088|5.0|So I am in the process of reading every one of Philippa Gregory's book. They are amazing and I cant put them down! As with most all books, it goes into so much detail that the mini series cant ! Her writing is very readable and definitely engaging!
6305428425|5.0|Wonderful character development and acting. Some rough language but somehow it goes with the characters. Despite their obvious mental handicaps they manage express some very deeps things in life. As things unfold and reach a nadir the two girls' situations improves rapidly  and you get swept up in the marvelous climax.
B005OP7162|2.0|For starters, we do not know enough about the history of the &#34;star&#34; to understand what the heck is going on. She makes some things happen to people that they richly deserve, but her luck? is too too much. Madeleine Stow is wonderful-- she does make you hate her-- but wasted here.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|i loved it, it was awsome, will watch again, soon. inspiring. i will order more movies like this, yes i will.

B007CIQ4B2|5.0|Ben Howard's debut collection is a wonderful mixture of moods. His voice often carries a load of woe, as in \\"Black Flies,\\" and his lyrics most often come from life's disappointments. His percussive picking style and non-standard tunings (CGCGGC in \\"Old Pine,\\" and CFCFGC in \\"Everything,\\" for example) give both energy and a minor-key edge. On first listening, you think, \\"This is not happy music.\\" But Howard doesn't simply report that love is precarious and fleeting, or that the future holds pain, or that the most beautiful places remind us of losses--he knows the formula: beauty is beauty because it dies. Beauty and loss are fused together throughout these songs, which are filled with moments when pain is redeemed by its poetry: \\"Gracious goes the ghost of you . . .\\" and  \\"As the old pine fell we sang / Just to bless the morning,\\" and in the hypnotic \\"Promise,\\" \\"Who am I, darling to you? / Who am I? / I come alone here / I come alone here.\\"<br /><br />Sometimes, too, the music itself trumps the meanings, as in the upbeat cadences of \\"The Wolves\\": \\"Now that we're lonely / Now that there's nowhere to go,\\" and sometimes the result is toe-tapping happy, as when he sends off a former lover with the driving chorus, \\"Keep your head up, keep your heart strong / No, no, no, no . . .\\" The opening song, \\"Old Pine,\\" is a nice summary of the ironies found throughout: memories of youth and friends and spontaneity are \\"the best things you ever had,\\" yet \\"We grow, grow, steady as the morning / We grow, grow, older still.\\"<br /><br />The more you listen, the more you'll hear. Ben Howard's the real deal.

B0058YPGSY|4.0|I could almost believe in these outlaws and their desire to live outside of the conventional society.  I enjoy the saga as it unfolds and these motorcycle outlaws are almost believably violent and dangerous.
0679746323|4.0|This book is not a quick read.  The authors deliver a very detailed, year by year explanation of how Mao rose to power and how he tightened and executed his grip as the supreme ruler over more than a billion people.  The detail, along with the Chinese names, can slow down progress in finishing, often requiring pauses and rereading throughout.  But, it certainly is worth the effort.  One comes out with a very thorough understanding of the man and his rule and it isn't very pretty.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This was a very eye-opening documentary. It gives one a lot to think about! I can't believe what is in some of our food. Ammonia in hamburger meat? EWWWWW...
B00ANDT3P2|4.0|While the series was too short, this was wonderful to watch again in anticipation of the upcoming movie. The bonus feature of the potential 4th Season plot line was terrific, and I am very sorry that it was not produced on that tact using the jump in time. The show would have lasted at least another 3 seasons with those updates in the character and story-lines.<br /><br />This is a must for anyone who followed the series and wants to see the movie.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|It a very resistance, very comfortable, have many places to put too many thing, and fit my needs very well.I love it!

B00CWIMVDW|5.0|In my opinion, Hannibal is one of the best shows on television. The acting is superb, the visuals are stunning, and the story is familiar enough to Thomas Harris fans to feel authentic but also unique enough to be fresh and surprising. My only problem with the show is that there are a mere 13 episodes currently in existence and I have to wait until spring to see more!<br />I recommend this show to anyone who likes smart, sophisticated television and who has a somewhat twisted sensibility. There is certainly bloody murder, madness, and of course cannibalism, but if these elements are not at least somewhat appealing to you, I can't imagine what you're be doing looking into a show about Dr. Hannibal Lecter in the first place.
0307949508|5.0|This is the second book in the millenium trilogy. Some of the writing is a bit weak, but still enjoyable and well worth reading.
B00DL47PHI|5.0|I watched this film knowing very little about the behind the scenes about whale capturing and exploitation of the whales for monetary gain. I kind of figured they weren't as comfortable as they were before they were captured and forced to live in tiny pools compared to a mega huge ocean. After watching this film, it cemented my opinion of never going to seaworld or any aquatic park that's similar to it.<br /><br />First of all these are killer whales. Killer being the keyword. Nobody said they're friendly or trainable to the extend that they won't harm anyone, which unfortunately was the case in this film. I'm not blaming the trainers for being attacked. I blame the company that set up the situation to make money off of these animals. The lies and excuses they give throughout the movie is mind numbing. The interviews the former trainers gave was informative and seemingly more truthful than the proponents of keeping killer whales captive. Of course seaworld wouldn't be a part of the film. When a company does this in a documentary, it tells me that they have stuff to hide, or possibly are in more legal trouble than letting on. If they're worried about editing, they can do what Dana White of the UFC does. He has his own camera and crew filming at the same time, since espn distorted an interview he had done previously, but I digress.<br /><br />I like animals. I don't love animals and I'm not a member of PETA or anything like that. I like nature, nature programs and seeing animals in their natural environment. There's something really wrong with having these huge whales in these small pools and it makes me feel sick to my stomach with the way the animals are treating each other since they're trapped. If they kill each other in the wild, it's different. It's because of territory or maybe another reason, who knows, but that's nature. When you put these multi-ton animals into a cage, it's like a wrestling match and the weakest gets hurt, as shown in the movie (I don't wantto get into it too much as I don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen the film). As we speak, sharks are eating seals, eagles are hitting goats off of mountains, and snakes are killing baby mice. It's nature and that's what they're programmed to do it. What they're not programmed to do is live in super small spaces like these whales. Most zoos are pretty good at giving animals enough space to roam and be themselves, with a couple of exceptions. I know not all zoos are 100% perfect, but I know people are keeping a close on them.<br /><br />Seaworld and other similar water attractions treat these animals like crap and expect them to play by the rules. a 200 pound trainer is no match for a 6 ton whale that has taken all that it's going to take, especially when you take away it's mate and children. I really wish there was a ban on these kinds of places. I know kids can like them, but it's because they don't understand and see what's really wrong here. The only way I can help out is by never ever going to any of these places and guiding my children to stay away from them.<br /><br />Watch this film because it's a great film and it exposes the cruelty to these animals. Free all of the killer whales back into their own habitat. Not just for the safety of the trainers, but for the sake of keeping killer whales in their own habitat where they belong.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|I am loving the instrumentation & arrangements on this album. It's very different from Future Sex Love Sounds. Great songs! Very well done.
B009RX85N0|5.0|The soundtrack from this series is instantly recognisable - going from dark and dangerous, to light and airy at the drop of a hat! Wonderful that they seem to be releasing soundtracks per season! Very few series will actually do this!
B00E6890RG|4.0|Dream Theater is a huge influence to Haken and you can hear riffs throughout this album that sound familiar and there's nothing wrong with that.  However, one thing unique about Haken is Ross Jennings vocals.  While I dig his normal vocal range I'm still acclimating to his falsetto singing, which he does a lot.  On this release the band is on fire and you can feel their energy and passion bubbling over. All tracks are excellent, but the standout for me is \\"Falling Back to Earth\\".  This has a little bit of everything.  A heavy crunch that segues into a quirky jazzy passage complete with a goofy carnival keyboard tone followed by a mellow psychedelic section that incorporates some really nice layered vocals that build up the song back to its main crunch.  Not everything is heavy; there are three ballad-type tunes that are nice break from the slamming stuff.  \\"Somebody\\" is one of those mysterious mellow tunes showcasing angelic keyboard playing and Gentle Giant vocal harmonies that closes out a great album.<br /><br />If you're new to Haken this would be the place to start.  But, for some reason I feel this is a transitional album. They are closer to creating a sound that sounds like Haken, no one else, so I will devour this but eagerly await their next release.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game.  It is truly addicting.  Great way to kill some time or when you are bored waiting in lilne.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|Loved this movie.  He could be just a tiny bit less.cranky.  Still lots of fun to watch.  Amy Adams was great.
B00915G6MG|5.0|AS ALWAYS IT WAS GREAT TO ADD TO MY COLLECTION.I ALREADY HAD SEASONS ONE THRU NINE FROM AN EARLIER PURCHASE.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Just got the DVD, took awhile before I decided to make the plunge and try it out.  I love it, I can't find a reason in a day why I can't work out for 20 minutes.  Being I haven't worked out in years, It was a great starter DVD and I love the fact that as I gain strength it has harder levels for me to conquer. Weigh in is today, we will see how good its working!!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I am quite satisfied with my purchase. I am so glad that I have apple products because of the support.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Not previously a Bruno Mars fan, I bought this album for the love ballad, &#34;When I Was Your Man&#34;, only to discover that this was a rare album where you like every song. Mostly upbeat, it has some great workout songs, and I recommend it to anyone who wants an album that is worth the money and they can put on and just hit play and listen to the whole album through.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series!! The production value and the character studies are awesome. The actors are wonderful. Love Maggie Smith, too.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Highly recommend these headphones. Used for in the home, mowing the lawn, and TV in bed. Noise canceling without pressure to the ears.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|The production and acting is what you would expect for the third installment.  The movie tries to get into Tony Stark's head but falls short of showing the character being vulnerable while interacting with a child fan-helper.  Not much movement in the character or story for the rest of the cast either.  There are some small technical advancements with the suit, a good cameo by Ben Kingsly, and the typical blow 'em up fighting with the latest villain.
B005WUHAX8|3.0|Case seems flimsy cheap looking, but I'll give it a try and see how it works. So far so good.
B00000CQJZ|5.0|Love Robert Donat. Love the suspense. This is good Hitchcock before he felt the need to be so gruesome and gory.
B006QVRUS2|5.0|First, the Blu-ray transfer is excellent. Picture quality is good as is the audio. Since this is just one step shy of filming a stage play with a single scene (the living room), the importance of these isn't quite what it is with action films.<br /><br />This is a very, very different film. It's like some of the stage play adaptations from the 1950's and early 1960's. In stage plays, dialog and its delivery is just about everything as action is limited by the confines of a theatrical stage. That's the case with this film.<br /><br />\\"Carnage\\" is so reminiscent of \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\\" it can be characterized as an updated reprise of the concept. Watching it is akin to watching a horrifying train wreck in mid-wreck, for 75 minutes in a slow motion replay loop. It was outright uncomfortable after the first 15 minutes with the tension for the following hour so thick I wanted to find an exit to escape the rapidly rising feelings of claustrophobia.<br /><br />I believe that's exactly what the screenwriter and Roman Polanski intended, and therefore they and the film succeed. I also believe it's why \\"Carnage\\" has over a dozen 1-star reviews with comments about acting being over the top. I've no doubt a good number of them felt the same tense, confining discomfort and didn't realize it's exactly the emotional response that was intended. Thus, nearly all viewers will either love or hate this film with very little ambivalence. If you feel uncomfortable, wishing you could escape by about 15-20 minutes into it, that's how you're supposed to feel. I'm comfortable with an emotionally evocative film that makes me feel uncomfortable as a major part of its art and story.
B0052SF6CM|5.0|I really enjoy it when EDM artist release a vinyl, because really that is where EDM is originally from.  \\"Sweet Nothing\\" is my favorite from the album.  I think even casual listeners to the radio can enjoy it.  You can't help, but get excited for the build up in the song.
0307744434|3.0|It was okay ---difficult to get &#34;wrapped up in it&#34;.<br />Kindda wonder what was the purpose of it other than fantasy.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Bateries were dated 06-2018, arrived in good shape and the voltage level was nominally over 3 V, as expected from fresh batteries.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Never played this type of puzzle before but it's easy to pick up and a lot of fun. Not hard enough to be frustrating at all. great game
B003157DTM|5.0|bought these for my 2 great-granddaugters.  one of the Mothers had 2 of these when she was a little girl, wouldn't go any place with out it.
2090338482|4.0|The next time I buy a book for class, I'll buy a new version.  The previous owner did his/her work in ink, so I can't just erase it.  I scan the page onto my computer, then I use Paint to white-out as much of the previous owner's work as I can.  This seems to work.  There's little bits and pieces of the previous owner's ink around the printed text, but not so much as to make the exercises impossible to do.  Fortunately, the previous owner did not do all the exercises, and we're rapidly approaching untouched pages in my book.
1781162646|5.0|This was a bit of a different take for Stephen King.  While it was a good fast read, it wasn't quite as yucky creepy as some of his others.  enjoyable.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I really enjoyed this book - well written and I couldn't put it down!  The author knows how to weave a good story and ends it well, unlike some books that may leave you hanging.
0800141660|5.0|I LOVE this movie! The DVD is nice. Haven't checked out the special features yet. Definitely worth the money. Very happy.
B000NOKA0S|5.0|One of my favorite collections...I had it on vinyl and then cassette; now the CD. The music is as haunting as the movie that used it as a soundtrack.
B00008G8LG|5.0|One of my favorite movies. DVD nice quality. The special features are nice, though repetetive. Well worth the money and just what I was expecting. I do wish I could find it on Blu-ray.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Great music, terrific movie!!! One of my all-time favorites!!! No matter how many times I listen to this CD it is ennoyable.
B00AFEXRME|2.0|My family was quite disappointed in this movie.  We like most Denzel movies.  Husband said this takes the place of Long Day Jpurney into Night as our bedtime movies for insominacs
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Don't allow this or other nde's to overrule scriptural content, but allow these modern day 'testimonies' to encourage you that God is real, He is love, and that we are in the world but not of it. This book is very compelling coming from a TOP expert in neuroscience. God is using this author to refute the prevailing atheistic worldview of people in this and other scientific fields. It was well written and edited to not push a denomination or religion but to just perot the oldest and most true fact... God loves you!
B002XMGGK6|5.0|Family enjoys most of the movies that Jamie Fox is in.  Bought it blindly and it was suspenseful and very enjoyable.

B002ZG983M|4.0|When I seen the movie the movie was kind of boring in the begin but start getting good in the middle of the movie.
B002VR9QXW|5.0|I was astonished at the beauty both of the visualizations and the emotional character of the dancers.  The scenes between Albrecht and Giselle in the second can not be seen without eliciting true emotion about their love for one another - a ballet with romantic drama actually realized.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is so awesome and addictive!<br />I highly recommend this to all gamers<br />Love, love, live it so much!
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a fun and entertaining game to pass the time. Enjoy the fact that the game does not require internet to play.

B00008IHN1|5.0|Awesome movie love it. I have to keep buying it because friends borrow my copies and forget to return it. So I have to get a new copy. Best movie ever....
1616550414|5.0|Dunno if its for everyone, bu its a must have for Zelda fans. I think it has a little something for everyone since everyone loves Zelda.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|How in the hell did this get 5 stars? Did the 5 star reviewer's read the same crappy book I did? Wth? I could not get past the first chapter... And it was free. I deleted from my kindle. I would not recommend this even if you were bored out of your mind and had nothing to read but the dictionary. 10 minutes out of life I won't get back.. Ugh.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I don't even know what this is but when I saw it I knew this was DESTINY!!! Of course I saw the famously youtube video that was posted. This is going to be a blast.
0061537969|5.0|I only started the book last night, already half way through. The author writes about dogs the way I have always thought dogs thought! Just loved the dogs stuffed animal, our dog carries his &#34;Teddy&#34; with him and always knows where he is.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|this is a series i got talked into viewing against my normal judgement. i'm usually an r rated action movie type.this series is very well written and acted.once engaged in the series it was an addiction,bravo ''Downton Abbey''.
B00867HDTA|2.0|Don't expect to play soccer in this game!<br /><br />The game is fun for about 5 minutes, then it's just redundant.  Shoot the ball into the goal changing direction in mid air (ah, basic physics problem there); hit the bull's eye if you can.<br /><br />I might be expecting a little too much as I just loaded FIFA 14 an hour ago and played a real game of soccer.<br /><br />They app is just not for me, but as it's the FAotD, give it a shot, you may like it....

B005LAIIMG|2.0|I GUESS YOU COULD SAY THAT THE ZOMBIE MOVIES HAVE GONE THE COURSE.  IT WAS JUST A LITTLE BORING.  GREAT ENDING.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I admit I was used to the facebook iPad app which is still not perfect but vastly better than this app on Kindle Fire. Perhaps most annoying is having to go back to the beginning every time you click a link or sometimes even after making a comment or looking at a picture. The layout also leaves a LOT to be desired. Step up your game PLEASE!
B00785P2QC|5.0|So much fun to play with great visual. Though I do wish it didn't cost so much to upgrade buildings.

B008ALA6DW|5.0|This is my second one of these since my first was stolen at work (keep an eye on your dongles!)  This is trouble-free, plug it in and it works.  Thunderbolt is fast enough to support full-speed GigE, so it's great for when you have to plug you Air into a physical Ethernet connection.
B00CFYAT6O|2.0|I have all of Trucks' CDs. And I love them! The occasional vocal by Tedeschi was fine. But this CD is very disappointing. Yesterday I was listening to \\"Live at Georgia Theatre\\" and was reminded of how far the band has fallen. I know groups change with time. I am glad to see a husband and wife together. I liked some of Tedeschi's solo albums. But on Made Up My Mind her voice is too sing song, too flighty, too little grit, too lilting which for some would be fine but not here. Did I say I'm disappointed?<br /><br />Made Up My Mind is musically tight. But they remind me of groups that are trying to get more air time on top 40 stations by developing a more commercially appealing sound. But \\"Made Up My Mind\\" is just plain boring. There are occasional good moments but there is no grit. And the inspiring moments are too short and infrequent. It is hard to call this CD Blues. I considered giving it 3 stars but in reality I don't like it so I  will give it 2. But I am so disappointed I should give it 1 star. Another reviewer mentioned Allman Brothers. They were one of my favorite groups when I was in college. And \\"At Fillmore East\\"  was an album that set the standard for Southern Blues. And Trucks had the edge and the grit and talent and was carrying the Allman style Southern Blues torch. No longer!<br /><br />If this is the direction they are going and they find it rewarding, good for them. But they should put some sort of warning label on their CDs or change the name of the group to avoid misleading those who like the older Derek Trucks Band may it R.I.P.
B000031WBV|5.0|After converting my vinyl album to mp3, I discovered the noise level was unacceptable.  So, I was very happy to find this cd replacement.
B000FC0V3E|4.0|Hemingway's spare,no-frills,yet elegantly descriptive style is very much in evidence here.His delineation of the male characters is such that one very quickly understands where they're coming from,and what their motivations are,which ,in turn,allows one to understand why they do the things they do.And this is accomplished so simply,and unobtrusively that the reader hardly even notices it happening.The primary female character,Brett Ashley,not so much.She comes off as a phony and a bore,and everyone's fascination with her can only be ascibed to their own lack of discernment,willful or otherwise.That constitutes a gaping flaw right at the heart of a less-than-great plot,which,in the hands of a lesser writer would have produced a book somewhere in the range of not-so-good to dreadful.The fact that Hemingway,despite this handicap,still created a well above average work,simply underlines the fact that the old master really was the old master.
B00DURHYWC|5.0|True to its title, this album makes one \\"get happy.\\"  This is a great collection of songs interpreted well by China Forbes, Storm Large, Meow Meow, Rufus Wainright, Phyllis Diller and others.  The orchestrations are seductive and the entire feel is exuberant.  A truly enjoyable album!
0321934318|4.0|Generally an easy read for manual with clear examples. A bit of humor also helps with the near feature overload of most new software. Keyboard shortcuts are excellent, but I couldn't find a summary list for quick reference because there are too many to remember and hard find in the manual. A shortcut summary guide would be great, I suppose I should have been creating my own.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|Carole King was amazing in the 70's and is still amazing.  She needs to share her secrets--so much energy and her voice sounds the same!
B00D2I8E46|5.0|Hi guys.  This is really a superior record in all respects and I think that all the earlier reviewers pretty much catch the cadences.  Great playing, some of EC's best singing and songwriting...can't go wrong.  I would say, though, that I disagree respectfully with the minor dis of the work with Baccharach, because if you re listen to it, the sentiments and music work together in sublime fashion.  I'd also list All This Useless Beauty as a lost Costello classic, simply because it has his best melodic structuring of pretty much anything.<br /><br />To this record.  The other reviews are uniformly excellent.  Smart crew.  But... as I was listening to it for the fifth or sixth time, I realized something.  Get Happy might have been his Stax/Volt/Motown record (after his self-immolation with his drunken crude comments about Ray Charles, the ones that got him clocked by, I believe it was, Bonnie Bramlett).  This one...it's his Curtis Mayfield record.  Seriously.  The songs are political, the vocal cadences are pure Curtis, the way-wah guitar is...well, pretty Super Fly.  There are variations on that scheme, but if you pay attention to the insistent funk rhythms and key/guitar riffs, it's Curtis Mayfield.<br /><br />Long may they run.

B004Q7IAQE|5.0|My daughter saw this hello kitty stuffed animal in a claw machine and wanted to try to win it.  I told her we could just buy it online.  Thank you Amazon for not making me a liar.  This was exactly the stuffed hello kitty she wanted.  It is big and well made.  The price is reasonable for what you get.  She takes it everywhere with her and even dresses it in doll clothes.  Highly recommend it.

Jackson's vocal range and inflections do not translate at all to the &#34;high lonesome&#34; of this genre.  His songwriting is good, but leave the singing to those with proven abilities in bluegrass.  It's a pity that his backup singers (i.e. Don Rigsby) would have done a much better job at making a great record.  Only a few country stars can transition between the genres (Gill & Bentley), but most of them started in bluegrass.  Alan, stick to country.
B0045HCJRG|5.0|Awesome movie !! You will have a blast watching this movie !! Get it.. you will not be  dissapointed - promise
B000056HOZ|4.0|I did not see this product.  It was a gift to a friend who loves Bruce.  It arrived promptly and was packaged carefully.  No complaints from my friend so I am assuming it was was a good choice.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|This is one of the best Jack Reacher books that I have read.  I recommend it to everyone who enjoys Lee Child.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I had long searched for a program that would allow me to store the many quotes I was collecting as I read. I wanted to be able to assign labels to them that would make it easier for me to find them for use in future writing projects or just to properly cite them for those I shared them wih. Enter, stage right, Evernote. It does all I had hoped for and much more. If it sticks around for the long haul, it will be a program I use for the rest of my life.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I liked this book.  It was well written.  There are a lot of story lines to keep up with, but I think the fact that those characters lives are reflective of the day to day person's, makes this book an easy read.
B000R9RGF6|5.0|Instrumental, almost classical, piano with a definitively modern twist. Ludovico Einaudi never disappoints, and this album is just about his finest.
B007RE0RR8|5.0|Everything I expected! Would buy again for my little girl.  She loved it.  She is her favorite minster high doll
B00DWZHTRW|4.0|Not real believable. A lot of special effects but the story was entertaining. A lot of action the trick was a good story.
1582701709|4.0|Great book!  Definitely would recommend.  Gives great examples of how to get the life you want/deserve and step by step process.
1616550414|5.0|Full of pics, stories and anithing about Zelda's saga. It's bigger than I thought and the quality of paper and design is very good.
B00BQEFM6Q|5.0|I am a huge fan of Phildel's musical style and her haunting vocals.  Every song on this CD is engineered to perfection and in my opinion one of the best of the year.<br /><br />This album is worthy of lots of attention and I hope that some of the songs will be placed in rotation on the radio.<br /><br />Each song is rich and complex, and best enjoyed at high volume. I highly recommend this album.
B00AA2I2NK|5.0|Instrumental, almost classical, piano that you won't be able to stop listening to. Recommend Ludovico Einaudi for all ages and stages.
0525478817|5.0|One of the most inspirational amazing books I have ever read. I could not put it down. I read the entire book in 3 hours!
B008Y212PI|4.0|It is a puzzle completely based on logic,not terribly difficult or challenging but fun. Maybe it becomes more challenging as you go up levels.
B00BD6KPFU|5.0|Best show I've seen in a long time. If you haven't seen it, this is a Must. Sly, witty, sexy, and smart ; all you need in a hit.
B000QI2ZWW|1.0|Worst movie I've ever seen.  Some of the songs were inappropriate for children and it never seemed to end. Not worth the $1.99 we paid for it.
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|Interesting book, with some fun experiments to do.  A lot like the. Secret but more interactive, even my 9 year old son could participate in the activities.
B002QVZ71I|5.0|What is so great about Forest is that his Love for Jenny is constant, faithful, and pure.  He never waivers in what he does.  He always handles life constructively and what seems like a positive manner.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|Not sure why it took so long to release it, but it was worth waiting for! Robert, Jimmy, and John were all on their game. Jason added a lot of fire and kept it moving.  This will be a classic album to be appreciated by all their fans for decades to come.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|Awesome!!! Great movie. Another good marvel movie to add to my collection. Can't wait to see the next Thor now!
B0028R3NCU|5.0|I used to keep a micro USB containing copies of all of my projects ... in my wallet. The security and accessibility was generally great, but ...<br /><br />Now I keep a Micro SD in one of these, with a Micro SD-SD adapter alongside.<br /><br />No cables, no mismatched ports. Phone to laptop to tablet (with a Rav pack). Never get stuck (like, with the Rav) with one SD port and one USB port ... and nowhere to go. True, there are SD-USB adapters, but they are not wallet-able. This is.<br /><br />I have to admit that a Max CMC wallet is handy for all of the stuff ... but this thing takes less space than the Verbatim Tuff I used to carry.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This game is funny, enlightening, and touches on subjects that are more mature than most games. I'm not in love with the grinding, but the dungeon formula works for me. Very individualistic formula, playing day by day as a high school student. LOVE the social links, without these the game would be average. The scene on the class trip where they all don't drink alcohol cracked me up. One of my favorite points in any game I've ever played.<br /> This game belongs on a short list of best JRPG's ever. While is follows a similar formula to most JRPGs, it completely deviates from the norm with game play. It really makes me hearken back to my own high school days. How can you not love Yukichan, Risechan, and Nanakochan?
B00COCY67A|5.0|The 3-CD set was wonderful.  Most of the music in these sessions is great. Elvis at his best. If your an Elvis fan and like the later years, you'll love this set.<br />The book is great, also. It gives a little detail of these sessions. There are some very good pictures included.<br />You won't be disapointed in the purchase of this 3-Cd & book combination
B004SIP9VA|5.0|This was originally a Japanese movie.  Hachi is another movie that Richard Gere re-made from the original Japanese verson.  If you love dancing this movie is inspiring and funny.  If only we could all dance like J. Lo and Gere.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|This was recommended to me by my son and he loved it and so do I, this is must see for sure
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Chromecast came out of the box, plugged directly into the HDMI port on my TV, USB power in and within 5 minutes I was up and running!  Chromecast automatically downloaded software updates when I logged into my wireless which took most of that 5 minutes.  Another two minutes and I had it installed on my Samsung Galaxy S2 phone.  Amazing clarity and sound which blew me away!  Amazingly simple to set up and use - even a novice could do it effortlessly.  By far one of the best investments I have made - Before I had to connect a desktop computer to my TV then log into that computer via the internet by way of LogMeIn.  Now I can sit in my chair with my laptop and watch amazing high def directly to my TV!  Will recommend this one to everyone!
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|Watch IT!!!!! Great family movie for Halloween. My daughter watched it twice in a row the day we got it.
B0024CEY36|5.0|This book is very well written. The plot is tightly woven with unexpected twists and turns. I couldn't put it down!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|One of the favorite of my grandchildren that I let them pay on my kindle.  I think it is good for their brain, also.
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|Great kids movie, 3D effects are not bad either.  Both my kids enjoy this movie, funny and heartwarming.  Good characters.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|This movie was made in 1969 and the special effects are amazing. I loved this movie as a child and now my children enjoy it just as much as I did.
B002LC8HF0|4.0|I really loved this series. They were thought provoking and unique. I'm not a huge sci-fi/fantasy person but they were suggested by a friend. They're worth reading, for sure.
B00B00RJJO|5.0|Like a fine Malt Whiskey Billy Bragg keeps the undertones of who he always was and will be and goes down easy.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Fast, predictive typing.  Sometimes amazingly so.  And now it has a flow (Swype like) option.  Joy!  The leader of the pack.
B0063IH60K|5.0|A good game for the kindle.  Goes fast and easy to play.  A nice filler while waiting for an airplane or being on it.
B00CJGP116|5.0|Awesome! He is the best!!  I love the new songs and some of the oldies interpreted by him.... Exeed my expectations
6305882592|5.0|I m a big Cat Stevens fan so this is on my top ten movies of all times. My 13 year old is now listening the the soundtrack all the time lol
B0058BI896|4.0|Amazon instant is awesome. Do we really need to say anything more. Big Bang makes me happy. You can put it in the background and half pay attention to it while you study for grad school
B006S08RLU|5.0|Best movie I've ever seen! Beautiful visuals, characters, and stories!!! It's definitely a must see, and it's a great way to practice French
B00BP0OL1S|3.0|I was surprised that the binding was broken.  I wouldn't have purchased it if I would have known that it was broken.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|Since I am prone to drop things this has been a life saver. The down side is the side buttons are hard for me to push with the cover on. Would recommend this product.
0345529057|5.0|Loved all the characters.  An exciting read.  Too bad I don't have anything else I would like to say on the matter!
B00C8USQEM|5.0|Every thing is great just as advertised. I will buy more when they come out. Big Bang is a great tv show. Hope it keep going.
0872860175|5.0|This is poetry everyone should read. I love this. It's inspiring and it changes the way you think about poetry after you're only taught about rhythm and rhyme from tea party republicans who think the only worthwhile poetry is in the Bible. This is beautiful.
B006PTZNSY|5.0|I love all of Nicki Minaj's songs and are slowly getting them all. I listen at the park. Very talented girl.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Free cell helps the time fly by during chemotherapy and keeps my brain working.  As I aapproach 500 winning games, I hope the achievement award entitled \\"no life\\"  translates to \\"keep on living!\\" :)
0770437400|4.0|The whole concept of virtually unkillable creatures that don't eat, don't need to breathe, can freeze and reanimate in spring is a big hurdle for me to overcome.  Fundamentally unbelievable...<br /><br />The rest of the book, following from this premise, is wonderful reading.  Societies response, as viewed through the lenses of a series of characters, is fascinating reading.
B00E8TVHBA|5.0|They love to sing along and even recite the dialog from the movie.<br />Even parents will enjoy this fun musical movie.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Super fun and addictive. A great app for passing the time and that's not completely mindless. Definitely a good buy I think.
1601254679|5.0|This is exactly what my fiance was looking for. He's so pleased with this book, but I don't think Paizo can come out with anything that he doesn't like.
B000AP04OM|5.0|The Sound of Music came alive for the small group of nursing home residents I showed it to. I have not looked at the second disk, and at some time will view it to see what is there. The entire movie was on the first disk.
B009FXIICK|4.0|This is a great version of the Nintendo DS classic.  Using this on a large touch screen actually feels better than playing on the DS.  However, this version does leave out a lot of the different modes and options of the DS version
0981951252|5.0|I love this book on CD! I have read hundreds of books on success but thtis one beats all of them. If you do something worhwhile you would definitely come across  road blocks or not see the end result and would give up. But if you keep on working eventhough you don't see any results you will succeed. This book tells you to keep on going. As the title says The Compound Effect, meaning the result of efforts are there but you will not see them,  beacuse they are too small, till you give more. So this books points out that there is light at the end of the tunnel!
B002LFAHBO|5.0|One of my all time favorites that gives hope, and a human perspective to life. Great to watch at any time of the year.
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|This album is great.  I love the style of all the songs & some sound like they came from earlier generations.  It's amazing to think how young he is!
B004478AS4|4.0|This is a good read. Kind of sad. It opened my eyes to a culture I didn't really have any knowledge of before. It is one that everyone should read.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This was the greatest movie.  I've seen it about a dozen times -- it never gets tiring to watch it. It's definitely a great movie to put on and view any time, but especially when you're feeling down -- you will always smile and be happy afterwards. It's a keeper.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|Boring and slow. It really was. I need to write seventeen words on here. One two three four five twelve
1449433251|3.0|I love Calvin and Hobbes, and this collection is great. Unfortunately it looks like somebody played soccer with it before it was sent to me. Not gonna try to replace it because a) my fedex guy had a heck of  time finding me, and when he did couldn't bring himself to actually climb the stairs to knock on the door, so I won't be ordering anything if it's shipped fedex, and b) the books are not falling apart and I bought them to read and reread and then for kids to read, etc., so sooner or later they were going to get beat up. But I'm not big on my stuff coming already beat up. Bottom line: I recommend this books, but if you can, get them from a brick and mortor and not an online store.
B00469XEZY|5.0|I Thought it was a great movie is rare to fine a perfect movie I know this one is not perfect but for me its good enough for 5 stars
1439152799|5.0|Another page turner; could not put this book down. Great story, awesome characters, with history backing it up. Kate Morton is my new favorite author. I can't wait for her next book!
B0084AXZK0|3.0|I didn't really like this. I skipped the whole middle part where he talks about jewels and fabric. It didn't get interesting until he killed somebody.
B002SQNM9A|3.0|Hey Taylor Swift is awesome and my daughter loves it. I was disappointed because the cd case was broken and it could have been packaged better for protection. It was a gift! A gift with the other Taylor Swift cd, Beautiful Eyes. Both cases were cracked and no replacement cases was offered.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|DT aren't messing around anymore. It's like they made a concerted effort to emphasize each of their best qualities with this release. This album is dark, yet uplifting. Complex, yet accessible. Mind- blowingly powerful sometimes, hauntingly gentle at others.  It's even downright weird in places, but all in a good way. Even the production is wonderfully strange- kind of confusing in ways that make you want to listen harder. It's described as \\"over-compressed\\" by some, which is a criticism I don't agree with. I feel there was nothing accidental about the production of this record. If it sounds muddled at times, it only enhances the sort of dark mystery of the overall vibe, almost like the music swims out of the shadows right before punching you in the face (hence, the title of this review). I love it. The band is at new level now, the music seeming to transcend the players, if that makes any sense. Usually when I listen to my favorite bands -any bands, actually- I picture the players performing the music in my head, as I'm sure many people do. When I listen to this album, I still do that, but it's different. It's almost like the music somehow flows through the band as opposed to coming from it, and, sometimes, the players tend to disappear altogether, allowing the music to hover independently in front of you like images on a screen. I'm aware of how pretentious that may sound, but I'm just trying to describe my experience of listening to this record. There's a strange subconscious unfamiliar quality to this album, which I can't quite put my finger on, nor, however, do I want to. I'm not gonna say any more. If you're a Dream Theater fan, you must purchase Dream Theater now (though something tells me you already have ;)).
B002JVWQSW|5.0|This is our son's favorite show so we gave it to him for Christmas.  He's had many hours of enjoyment.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Very interesting game. Keeps a person on their toes.<br /><br />It's very challenging, you have to have keen eyesight.  Some of the items are very hard to find.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|A great take on Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.  Romance and time travel, what more could you want. I think this might make teens interested in more of  Jane Austen.
B00B9ZC74C|5.0|I heard about this book on the &#34;No Agenda&#34; podcast (if you are not listening to it, you are missing out). The story is a fast read with all sorts of scary implications if even 1/3 of it is based on fact.  What is really exciting is that the book comes with a bibliography.  How many fiction books come with a list of books and articles supporting their thesis?  A scary look at potential future war.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Everything was as it was supposed to be.  That is all I have to say. the end the end FINALE!
B00E89VXQY|5.0|In a world where whiny, narcissistic, teenage boy band films have dominated the silver screen, it's nice to finally see a REAL METAL BAND finally stepping into the 21st century and providing the world with a visually stunning and incredibly satisfying concert-film experience! In case you've been living under a rock, Through The Never is the live album of Metallica's 3D motion picture, which infuses footage starting from the 2008 Death Magnetic World Tour that most die hard 'Tallica fans have claimed to be the best Metallica tour ever because of it's over-the-top theatrics, hotter-than-hell pyrotechnics and overall showmanship via crowd interaction from the four most stoic men of metal. If you watched the movie and you kept losing your 3D glasses cause of incessant head banging, then this album is for you. If you've seen Metallica live in concert, then consider this album a time machine, designed to transport you back to those ear bleeding moments of euphoria, where The Memory Remains and Nothing Else Matters.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00BD6A5FU Dont Tread On Me Brand - Shattered - 50/50 T-Shirt DTOM]]
B003L77G06|5.0|This is our son's favorite show so we gave it to him for Christmas.  He's had many hours of enjoyment.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|Great production!  And the extra bonus of seeing Andrew Lloyd Webber , hearing Sarah Brightman and current and past phantoms all performing together for the 25th anniversary was just wonderful!!
B004SIP7AS|4.0|Good , lighthearted story. A good place to start if you haven't read ( or watched) Jane Austen before. I can't imagine there is anyone who hasn't.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|The DVDs were for my grandson and he said he loves them.  His dad (my son) was into Star Wars when he was 7--which is how old my grandson is now--so they have fun comparing notes.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|Everything was as it was supposed to be.  That is all I have to say. the end the end FINALE!
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|User friendly tracker, flawless operation. The Android app needs more attention quickly but the IOS app is near perfect. Also nice dashboards trough web-browser. Use it daily and constantly.
1400049628|5.0|Loved this book. Makes you think about things you wouldn't have, but also gives reasonable arguments for dealing with a variety of situations.
0920236162|5.0|Perfect for a princess book without being too princessy!  Good for both boys and girls.  Excellent choice for new babies or new readers or friends with relationship issues!
