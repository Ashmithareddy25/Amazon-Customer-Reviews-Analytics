B00AHSIQWE|3.0|As always batman delivers a I'm better, richer ,smarter , then you hero . Full of action fighting to stay on the good side and with cristian bale you get that . Christian bale looks like he is going to have a meth induce rage . That's going to destroy Gothim . I got you're attention didn't I ? you never thought about it till now . He's a perfect batman .
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Should have begun earlier in the day.  Impossible to stop thinking about the story and the people--no longer just characters in a book.  Wonderful portraits of time and place and injustice and justice in spite of bigotry.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|The movie delivers on the action pack part . But I fail to understand really what Jason Bourne is tying to uncover this time. Oh! Yeah! He's identity . Wow don't we all ? If you want some action here's the movie to watch . If you're looking for an intelligent mind twisting plot . Sorry this is to it .
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I love U or this game it the absolute best game it's up there with tapped out,skirts,and Sims really this is one,of ur best choices
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I don't know how she has the strength to do all the things she does. If! She's starving but it's a great movie .
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The characters are soooo cute. It updates every once in a while and it just gets better and better. I can tell the creators are always trying to improve the quality of the game. Highly recommended for people of all ages and looks great on my Kindle Fire HD!!!!!!!!
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Good move the plot was interesting . To discover that you are one of many . Hum and what's wrong with earth ? just like the movie &#34; After earth&#34; the planet looks better then before so why are they trying to keep ppl out?
B00946ZOT8|3.0|She arrived on time! Amazon never fails to deliver stuff on time. As for the actual doll, I gave 3 stars. Here's why:<br />The box had a little dent but undone mind because I display the Pink label barbies on the doll stand, so I don't mind the box. I threw it away.<br />But for the doll herself, the face was very pretty. But she looks too much like Barbie and not like Rosalie.<br />Her hair was really thin, so that kind of bothered me.<br />But the thing that bothers me most is her feet. Her ankles are crooked and they turn from the way she was put in the box. So she is a little lopsy on her stand. And the shoes she wears are meant for a Silkstone doll, not a B2K.<br />So that's my review.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|If he's passing the torch . Well it just went out . The plot is as dumb and as the female villain who sells her own father for some cash. Bruce Willis actor son fails to intrigue me . Like he did in spartucus . And we're are the accent ? And the vodka all the stereo types of a good Russia film ?
B00C74HKF0|5.0|I love Audrey Hepburn, so when I saw this doll I had to have it. She is a little different from the picture being she has both arms bent and not one. But other than that she is beautiful. He clothes come with little stitches so they don't fall off (craft and shirt). Her shoes have little ribbons, so if taken off they might not go back on unless you tie with tweezers. As for her face, my doll had crooked eyebrows but I don't mind. It still look just like miss Hepburn. Over all, good buy.
B00DHNBPA6|2.0|Nothing more scarier then to have a branch shove deep inside of you to know you're in trouble . Why does the plot revolves in a junkie and a old nasty cabin house . I don't know ?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My daughter loves it, doesn't like to put her Kindle down!! She is already on level 12 and it's only been 2 days, thanks for a great game!
B0090EIILU|4.0|Funny funny funny once again Sacha delivers in his movie . If you just want to laugh you're pants off . And make your old granny piss in her pampers . Then this is the movie for you . Whether granny piss inherent diapers for laughing . Or because she's mad at you . For watching such a ridiculous movie . At least you won't regret it .
B004GJDQT8|5.0|How could I live without this app? If you need to find apps. for your tablet this is the way to go! It's simple to use finds what your looking for in a heart beat. This is the one I use the most. I can even use it to purchase apps. or products while moving about the house or any place I have3 a WiFi connection. ( mine is not a phone, just a 4&#34; internet tablet) The only problem I ever have with it is, I loose my connection. This is no fault of the Amazon application. I highly recommend this App. AMAZON MOBILE.  Semper Fidelis
B002MQYOFW|5.0|THIS BOOK IS AWESOME BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ I WOULD RECOMEND THIS BOOK TO EVERYBODY  THIS BOOK HAS CONFLICT ROMANCE JUST WHAT A GOOD BOOK NEEDS
B0064X7FVE|1.0|this thing never works, it jams or gets lost, it's easier just to look out the window or check the the TV'
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Love it!  I have a 50&#34; Samsung DLP that I bought 7 years ago.  Being an older set it lacks wi-fi access.  I was considering upgrading to a smart TV so that I could stream video content such as Netflix, but with Chromecast I now have that ability for just $35, which beats the heck out of the cost of a new smart TV.  I would give the device 5 stars, but find that it crashes when powered by my TV's USB port.  I get flawless operation when I connect it to my house's AC current (which is the recommended setup) but there it becomes another &#34;energy vampire&#34; sucking power even when it's not in use.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|This is my Choice in music players for a small Android Internet Tablet. I use this on my Polaroid 4&#34; internet tablet. Mine is a simple tablet, no phone on it or GPS. However this app. MoboPlayer just works, and does it well. So a hearty Thank You to the makers of this app. This one finds your music or videos from multiable files and folders with out much help from the user. This is nice if your not a computer geek. (No offence) I am a user of apps. not a programmer. For small tablets this one is PERFECT! I highly recommend this app. MOBO PLAYER ! Thank you for making a product that works. Semper Fidelis
B0063M22QO|5.0|good game. I can't stop playing. I play tip my device dies. I would recommend to others who like card games.
B00AW57L96|5.0|What a fantastic read - it intertwines the lives and storys of three different women and cleverly brings them together.  It really leaves you thinking - if you were in those circumstances - what would you do?  Hard to put down - enjoy!
B00DJWV11I|5.0|This book was great.  As women we want to give men more credit than they are due. And yet, there are times when they deserve more credit. This was a great read.
B00GM4H5YM|5.0|A Semi Classic worth your time to watch and enjoy. A remake of Rio Bravo for the most part, and in my mind not as good as the original, but highly entertaining in its own right. While Wayne was the Sheriff in the original, Mitchum is here, a drunk getting over a failed romance (shades of Dean Martin's role in the original) and Wayne is the outsider who comes to the aid of his friend. An exceedingly affable outing for the two big stars with the introduction of a young James Cann as a young man bent on revenge who can't shoot a lick. Lots of action and good humor.
B001AI6ZGO|5.0|A brilliant album and the cd includes some rear film footage. Nicely packaged and includes an informative booklet about the band. The three album releases from the group which include 2nd, and Live'74, are worth adding to your collection. Experimental rock at its best!
3836538725|5.0|A spectacular book by one of the world's greatest living photographers.  Stunning. The book is beautifully printed and, in the Taschen tradition, the price is surprisingly low.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|You only get a few games if you want more you need to buy lives or wait who has that kind of time?
B008Y73940|5.0|An excellent movie with Mathew McConaughey as a lawyer that works from a limousine.  He takes clients that many would turn down because they may not look innocent.  When he gets the wrong man off he works to see that justice prevails even if it may mean he is disbarred.<br /><br />CA Luster
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book took me by surprise. It was exciting from the moment I started reading it. What I liked best is that the author didn't keep you waiting too long to reveal the husband's &#34;secret&#34;. And yet, even though you knew the secret, many interesting things happened and everything came together perfectly towards the end. I couldn't put the book down and read it in just a couple of days. I just ordered another book written by the same author.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like it. I use it often . Love the size . Couldn't  do with out it. Great app! It is readily available on the screen wall. Never fails me.
B003QCCS36|2.0|Two good songs.  The rest I could throw in the garbage. I think his more commercial songs carried the record.  I was bored to tears.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Lovely story about the beauty in horror. Glad I read it - my book club will discuss on Monday. How does this stuff happen?
B002ZBT84G|1.0|I like the musician, but the recording quality was awful.  Most of the songs were barely audible unless I turned up the volume really high. I think I would have enjoyed the music if not for that.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Loved the story line, it kept me wanting more. Hope there will be more like this from John Grisham. Kept me very interested page after page.
B000099T2L|5.0|This is my favorite Beyonce.  My daughter purchased it and I spent so much time listening to it, that when she left for college (with it in her possession) I repurchased it.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|I love Nevosoft games and this one has not let me down. It is challenging with out being overly hard. Not only do I enjoy this one but my grand daughters love playing also. So if younlike hidden objects game with a few puzzles to solve you will enjoy this one
B002ZFQD0E|2.0|I bought this record because I listened to all of the hype.  Maybe I'm just not progressive enough when it comes to music.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|Just got it couple days ago. Locks up most times not allowing even getting to title screen. Makes it hard to rate fairly when my kindle barely sees the game. Looks a. bit impish but will try it out since its free.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The same I wrote about Fifty Shades Freed.  I am a psychologist and it was very interesting for me to read about sadomasochism in a differenet way, not in study books but in a novel.  I loved it even if they were sadomasoquistic practices.  The way the author describes Christian Grey makes me love him.  I've talked to friends who have read it and they feel the same. I really liked the trilogy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so excited when I noticed it was finally for kindle. I had to uninstall it on my Samsung Galazy Discover due to an update that wouldn't allow me to continue to upload to facebook and I lost everything and I was up to 50 (recently started playing) I know some are saying only 50. Lol!. When I realized it was on my kindle fire I was bake to 15 on my phone but once I downloaded it and connected to facebook I gained my 50 points back and I was so excited!! Absolutely LOVE IT!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have already read the trilogy.  The first I bought in the store.  The other two I ordered directly and I had them immediately, without leaving home.  I liked the way the author describes the events.  I could &#34;feel&#34; what the people in the novel were experiencing.
B009NQZVKG|3.0|Typical James Rollins Formula.  Most of the 'hot' authors get that way sometimes. But we still buy them and read them.
B000PC0SPU|5.0|I was looking for a book on design thinking to read for work and was pleasantly surprised to find six other principles to try and add to my portfolio beyond just the one I had begun searching for. Dan offers terrific insight into his writing about the reasons to make the change toward greater high concept and high touch skills and then gives practical advice about how to improve each of them.
0307346609|5.0|This is not my usual thing.<br /><br />First, it's fiction.<br />Second, it's zombies.<br /><br />But it's GREAT!  I did not realize there was a movie made from one of these scenarios... I've never seen the movie.  This book is extraordinary.  Such a great study of human nature and survival.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This is just a wonderful app for all ages, but all of a sudden after about six levels these annoying advertisements started showing up, not one but 2 at a time! Also some goals are only obtainable by gems.  Would have given it a 5 star rating for the concept, graphics and fun!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Not as good as the first book but way better than the 3rd, I was disappointed that Katniss ended back up in the Hunger game again, seems like the author could have gone in a different direction but with that said, the book is a worth while read
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This always freezes 1 minute into playing.  It does say it's compatible with our Nabi Jr but never could get it to work.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|The more you think about this book the more depth you will find in it. Some people claim it to be Austen's best. for me thats still pride and prejudice, but this story is so subtle that one reading will never be enough to understand all the layers of it. and be warned this is no love story no matter who told you it was. it is a book all about emma! with all her flaws and perfections.
1423136802|5.0|I bought this set for my fourth grade struggling reader who just brought his Lexile up to grade level.  He is thoroughly enjoying it, and I did, and as many other of my students have done.  This is probably my fifth set of the Percy Jackson series!<br /><br />I highly recommend it for kids and adults who like to read or who are learning to like to read!  They have enough action to keep everyone engaged!
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|I am baffled at the amount of excellent reviews this movie received. I really, really, really wanted to enjoy this movie. As a fan of The Illusionist and The Prestige, and movies of that nature, it's safe to say that I love movies about magicians and illusions because I want to see if I can figure out how they pulled the trick off. This movie was an epic fail for me on so many levels, for starters, it was waaay longer than it had to be. The idea and the premise was actually good, and I loved the actors in this movie, and their illusions were visually stunning. However, I agree that some of these stunts were just unrealistic and unbelievable. Even the best magicians in the world couldn't pull of what they pulled off. On top of that, the ending dropped the ball for me. I guess I couldn't see what the hell they were doing? I get that it wasn't about they money, but there had to be something more than what we saw. I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen the movie yet, but that ending. The ending was very anticlimactic for me, and I felt like I had been robbed out of the last 2 hours and 5 minutes of my precious time. It was all for nothing! That ending was really, really sorry!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is sooooooo cool me and all my friends love it. the only flaw is that it takes a while to download
B00992CF6W|4.0|just to warn you there are no caves in this version,the world is not infinite,you don't have that many items In creative, and you cannot travel to the nether or the end. If you want these things get the pc or x box edition.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Don't download this game unless you have the time to devote to it because it is addicting to say the least. Thought it would be a little time waster and fun, but you cant seem to stop playing, just waiting on that last number you need. Nice way to make friends also, but would like to have an in-game link to add friends without having to do the external FBook search to add friends.
1452113432|5.0|Awe yea! Rachel Khoo know how to cook or what? One of the best in my collection. Brings you the basics not just recipes.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A very unique storyline.  Took me a bit to get into it, but when I did it was hard to put down.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|After waiting for the book I was disappointed. All POVs sounded the same and instead of resolving problems from the other 2 books, new problems were introduced with a rushed ending.
B00CO52NLI|5.0|This is a great game. It's good for the kids and costs no money. It's a great preview to the full game if kids really enjoy it!
B0020BUWX2|5.0|This book pulls at your emotions and makes you really feel for the characters, if you can read through the tears this emotional ride is well worth the read. Gayle Forman is fantastic.
030758836X|5.0|This is an amazing book! I have gotten over 10 friends to also read the book. This book is a page-turner, sitting-on-the-edge-of-your seat, can't-believe-what-you're-reading kind of book. If you like mystery, suspense, great plot....why haven't you already read it!?
B0028RXHCG|5.0|A 5 star rating for the item works great for my application, but only 1 star for the seller, item did not come as described.
0307341550|3.0|I bought this book because I read Gone Girl (which was absolutely phenomenal). However this was not nearly as good. It's an okay, quick read, but nothing special.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|sweethighly enjoyable It's a fun game.  play it regularly. challenging at times.<br />like it much better than bejeweled just wish the music was different. but still love it anyway.
0689853637|5.0|Adorable. Kids continue to love it more every year. I will buy any Sabuda books. Wonderful Christmas gift for any age
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Another great book by Riordan! I like seeing the continuation of a well established world and interesting characters! I was glad I checked it out; if you loved the original Percy Jackson series, you'll love this one!
0152048049|5.0|New appreciation for this classic. First read it around the age of twelve as simply a story. Did not realize the Life lessons the story provided. Now give as gift to young people with advice to find useful meanings to the adventures.  Found that  parents enjoyed the book more than their children.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|Works exactly as advertised for both USB 2&3 devices. Used with a printed, scanner, external SSD hard drive, and Bluetooth device.
B000SVZIGC|5.0|Beautiful, and I as a historian, I almost thought it was the untold real story. But if you people don't know she really did die in real life, so this story is what would of happen if she lived.
B009NXD6JM|5.0|This is a wonderful story that never gets old. Audrey Hepburn is a time honored elegant actress who can make you think of people we know in our day to day lives
B000SEIK2S|1.0|I have got the book because of so many good reviews. I did not finish it, I could not. The premise at first seems interesting, but then there is no explanation on why it is just old people are being recruited. Why Earth is so inferior in technology, why there is so much isolation, why there are so may flesh eating aliens... And so on, and on, and on. Now it does look like a video game. And cannibals aliens? Pleeeeeease.
0634022296|4.0|Song Book is awesome! Everything is correct just like the Beatles played it. The binding on this book is way too stiff, its hard to hold the book open when playing, I used construction clamps! So, I took off one star for that.
0345529057|5.0|One of the most thrilling epic novel i have ever put my hands into. It's so exiting that even i got to read 2 books in less than a month... and considering that my native language is spanish, so reading in english might be exausting sometimes
B0012GTZC0|5.0|I saw the movie years ago and thought it would be fun to read the book.  I was not disappointed.  It was a great read.
159463176X|4.0|Great shipping!  And the end result, the book, was really a good read.  It does take concentration as the book spans years and the author goes back and forth in time while introducing new characters.  One person in my reading group actually made a chart of the characters and their relationship to on another.  It's not a pick-up-for-a-minute-and-put-down book as it would be difficult to keep the continuity and know what's happening.  But if you can devote time to reading bigger chunks of the story you'll profit more from the book.  It all ties up in the end.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Very enjoyable.  The court proceedings were belabored a bit at times.  I know, that is what Grisham does.  I hope Jake shows up some more.
B0094K1PW4|4.0|super 8 is just fun .I  Iove movies starring kids. steven spielberg and stephen king know it.Remember IT?This movie is just straight up fun.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Buy it its kinda laggy but its all worth the money. Its like GTA if you've hearer of it. You can do missions act like a responsible person trapped doing missions in a game. There's just a lot of fun things to do in this game. So buy it its all worth the money.
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|Terrible quality dreaming . I don't think I will rent anymore movies in the future. Starting and stopping is not a fun evening..
B00C5R7B0I|4.0|Scarpetta is back and the way she was before!!! Thanks Patricia Cornwell to bring back the characters the way they were and successful!!! I was a little scary to give this book a try because of the two or three of Mrs. Cornwell who were to my opinion bad! So i start reading it and first it start slow so I was more afraid but when the plot and characters were in their place I was having really hard time putting this book down! Luckily for me I had schedule a vacation week this week so could read has much as I want!! A real pages turner and really appreciate that the author bring back her writing the way it was in her first books with Scarpetta. So thanks to the author and please give her a try because you won't be disappointed with this one and long life to Scarpetta, Marino, Benton and Lucy!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|SUPER Addictive Game At First. But then it kind of gets boring after a while. But it is super fun to play cause you go on an international tour. So much fun.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I had just started playing candy crush on my phone when I got my kindle, and now I'm so excited to be able to play on it!! It's Soooo much fun this way! Absolutely a fan!
B00EUS9JF0|4.0|Pretty nice album. Better than expected. Need to hear all the songs again. During the 60s I listened to the Beatles.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|A little slow to start but fun good graphics. Easy game play, keeps you entertainment for hours. Overall good game for free.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I absolutely love, love, love Candy Crush! I love the challenge of every level even if it takes me a few tries to master it! The only thing I don't like is that u have to wait 24 hrs after u finish a guest or u have to pay money!  I feel that if u finish the entire series and make it to the quest, then u should only have to complete the quest and not pay money or wait till u can go forward! Either way, I will be patient  and  complete the quest where I don't pay so it's all good! I recommend this game to all of my friends!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is by far my favorite game. If you like puzzles you will love this game. I can play for hour.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|I never tire of watching this movie every Christmas Season. Natalie Wood is sweet and smart. The other actors are believable.  A wonderful story which is not trying to be anything but good, wholesome entertainment.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|This game is so addictive.  I was disappointed that it didn't have very many levels.  Mastered quickly, I want more.
B003VDY7XE|1.0|Stupid contrived themes made this series impossible to continue after a few episodes.  A knock off of the Medium, but I couldn't get interested in these characters. Purchased it due to its setting in \\"Maine,\\" in the credits I discovered it is filmed in Nova Scotia.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This is such a cute game with a ton of interactions.  I enjoyed playing it on Facebook and am so thrilled to see it on the kindle.  Thanks amazon
1582701709|5.0|Reading this book has positively enforced my lifelong belief of Everyone being able to create their own reality. Sometimes, knowing there are so many people out in the world that feel the same, dream the same & want the same peace, success & happiness, make's a person feel stronger.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|I already bought one and like 'em enough to buy this as a gift. Works well. I use it with Microsoft MapPoint. I have a Garmin Nuvi, but the disadvantage of small GPS and all smartphones is display size.<br /><br />This inexpensive receiver turns any old or new notebook into a large display useful for overview. My steel home roof rarely blocks it.<br /><br />Some people rip the magnets out but when I put it against my notebook screen I get no distortion so I don't see the point unless you want to park it next to a magnetic compass. I use quality Velcro-brand stickyback Velcro for such things instead.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|great challenging game!!!! no glitches...fun fun fun!!! great for all ages. give it a 10! very addicting! recommend it to everyone ..works on my kindle with no problems.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Awesome. the game has so many bots 2 choose from like atom. Plenty of trials and games. thank you for the awesome game. thanks so so so so much.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I  like this game. Wish you could level up faster. That maybe the only downside besides the fact you have to use crowns for everything
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Excellent book. I greatly enjoyed reading it to understand who Steve was and the history and culture of Apple.  Very well written.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Great good quality well mad gift for my outdoor friends. Everybody can use one of these for their pocket knives and even in the kitchen. I put one onthe shop and at my desk to easily keep my knives sharp.
0744014956|5.0|This guide is really made for who wants to have an awesome quality game guide as a collection for a great game as GTA
B00FWPWNKS|1.0|In most match games,the items reshuffle when there are no more possible moves so u can keep .playing. this game just sits there and doesn't reshuffle. So frustrating!! What r u supposed to do?
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Compact and functional. Works better than some larger devices I own. Fits in a pocket on your sheath (if it has pockets). If you are obsessed with sharp blades, GET IT!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I am so happy this title is finally available for the Kindle Fire. I have been paying it non stop since I downloaded it. If you found this review helpful please click yes below!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|LOVE IT!! Can't put it down. Wish there were more games like this. GRAPHICS ARE SUPERB! I played the Facebook version of this game also. I liked them both.
0307271609|2.0|There has been numerous articles and books about the lady who hang on to her power too long. She had the guts to dump her nephew's wife into a well before fleeing Peiking. In this book there appears to be nothing new, all known photos and sources see many many times. She did a so-so job to communicate to those who knew nothing about dowager. Chang could not relate to, for example, the Emperor Protection movement and what Americans like General Homer Lea try to rescue the Emperor. Like her previous book on Mao which often mixed statements with distorted facts. I will give her more stars had she interviewed those who's parents or grandparents were associated with her.  There are many flaws more so than her previous books. She did not include quotations and provided reference source.<br />She could have compare Jiang Qin, Mao's 5th wife to Tsu-hsi or Cixi to make some analogy.<br /><br />This is an interesting book to read but not for academic and credible study. I gave her ** for doing a so so job.
B00CHCUR9I|5.0|This #1 issue is so great! The Walking Dead television show is pretty spot on! It really catches the attention of any zombie fan. I will be able to read this issue over and over!!!
B00CH87HF4|4.0|love the game and the gameplay and the storyline.  get frustrated that have to pay for extra inventory slots and etc...
B00DHBOQMM|3.0|I have read all of Michael Connolly's books,  This was OK, but simplistic in its style... think I am over this author
B00CHIMG6Y|1.0|If you are an ambulance chaser, or the type of individual that likes to linger around as people are suffering after a bloody accident, then this movie is for you.  Otherwise, just move on to a better film.  This film does not even serve as a reasonable documentary of the tragic event.  Don't waste your four bucks on this.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love it so much it al ways brings a smile to my wonder full face I LOVE IT SO MUCH
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Decent story considering its an action/special effects film. Robots are done really well. Monsters/aliens could have been better. Lots of action with a well rounded ending.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I don't think I disliked a single  word. This was a beautiful story, from love to the beauty of people even when it's so hard to find. I loved every word.
0763660531|5.0|This is a beautiful book and tells a story solely with illustrations.  My children and I have enjoyed other picture books without words including 'Flotsam' by David Weisner, 'Chalk' by Bill Thomson and 'The Red Book' by Barbara Lehman.<br /><br />The illustrations in 'Journey' are wonderful, magical really.  The story is about a girl who's bored and can't get anyone in her family to play with her.  She goes to her room feeling sad but discovers a bright red crayon and decides to make her own adventure and draws a door in the wall that takes her to a beautiful forest with a winding river.  She draws a boat and sails to a city made of castles where men are trying to capture an exotic bird.  She bravely rescues the bird but finds herself captured and placed in a cage.  The grateful bird helps her escape and together they fly to safety and back to the city where the girl lives to make a new friend.<br /><br />What I like about this book is that the girl is always thinking, she's faced with some challenging situations but she's brave and clever and when she's bored she uses her imagination to enter a world where anything is possible.<br /><br />A wonderful message to young children and a beautiful book that the adults will enjoy as much as the children do.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|excellent game but it has stopped me from playing blocks for some reason and just freezes when I try so cannot get various objects needed
B00GB7GX20|5.0|Great song, I just had to purchase it twice because the first time the song was cut short at 2:55 minutes instead of the whole 3:50 minutes.  Had some trouble downloading it from my computer to my cell.  but that might have an issue with my phone.
B000FCKC4C|2.0|I really don't like this book. I wanted to like it, and I kept waiting for it to get good, but then I reached the end of the book and felt like I wasted my time. My tastes aren't mainstream, I guess. *shrug*<br /><br />As for why I didn't like it. I remember some particularly repetitive and long-winded (pun intended retroactively) conversations with the wind and sun? And yes, I get metaphors, but no, I didn't like many of the ones in this book. The language just got really... meh.  There are some nuggets of truth to be found in here, for sure, and it is mildly inspiring at times. For that reason, I won't give it one star. Also, I like that Coelho made it big time on a book about pursuing one's personal legend. That's a better story than this one!<br /><br />But still, I'm surprised this is a bestseller.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|This books is alone the lines of a classical romance novel just with more graphic love scenes.  Not a bad read and can be engrossing but not much content to think about or contemplate.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Darling, I recommend this extraordinary application for your special device. It creates and explores challenges for all ages and kinds. Invest in your future addiction today!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I really liked this book...the entire series. I understand the feelings readers had about the ending, because we prefer, expect and hope for an all-around happy ending. We take for granted the authors' imagination. But I believe Veronica Roth ended this book genuinely. SHE STAYED TRUE TO TRIS'S CHARACTER.  Any other ending would have been forced and would not have reflected the characters she created. This is a very well written series and I encourage everyone to read it to the end. Well done Veronica.
1582701709|4.0|Intersting read.  Gets you thinking about what and how you are calling things and situations into your life.  The DVD is even better than the book, but with the book you can ear mark and under line important perks.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is great - my 3-1/2-year-old granddaughter loves all the Ice Age movies, so she really enjoys this game.  Too cute!!
B0029LCJJS|5.0|The brilliant series that brought  Renaissance history to TV, even if not exact, began history being the subject of so many other  series; Borgias, White Queen, Spartacus, and I hope many more.  As a long time Anglophile and history buff, to see it come alive for those unaware, is so satisfying.  The show itself was so well done in every way, and will always be my favorite period of English history.  The writing, sets, costumes,  and  attention to detail, needs no more kudos from me, other than to encourage others to watch.<br />I hope that someday there will be a PG version so that children can get as excited about history, as the rest of us.  It is truly true that history is truly more exciting than fiction.  Nevertheless, for adults this is a timeless, brilliant, series.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Great app that I use on my Kindle Fire HD.  It's so much easier to stay connected these days, and this is another great app to help you do just that!
B001VM0LAK|3.0|NOT EVEN A SLIGHT COMPARISON TO THE ORIGINAL, &#34;THE DAY OF THE JACKAL&#34;.  I GUESS WE'VE RUN OUT OF IDEAS.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Great app - my 3-1/2-year-old granddaughter has so much fun with it!  I highly recommend it and she loves it!
B00F0N7JUG|5.0|I loved this movie! I wasn't going to write a review about it but after browsing the ridiculous 1-star reviews, I just had to put in a 5-star rating to offset that nonsense. People saying that it was illogical or &#34;they should have done it this way!&#34; are just not getting it. This IS how it happened, so just enjoy the story for what it is! Do all stories unfold in the most logical manners? It's as if you don't know how to enjoy a good action movie. This movie was non-stop action that was gripping, and it even had a good storyline. If you don't like it, that's fine but don't go around telling people that they're stupid and ignorant if they liked it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game.  We are a family of horse professionals, so my 3-1/2-year-old granddaughter LOVES this game!!  I highly recommend for kids of all ages!!!  So much fun!  Believe it or not, they actually can learn a lot about horse care through this game while having a great time!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Ñeeds more levels. Loved it!! Too short. And not too complicated. My type of game. Hop new levels come out soon
B006OCM0G0|4.0|crazy addictive.. i played this game until it became too much of a time commitment lol. but if you love things like tap zoo and tap ranch this is the game for you.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Worth the read.  Enlightening and depressing.  The stark contrast of north and south Korea is thought provoking and is still apparent today.
0307719227|5.0|Incredibly thought-provoking discussion on political and economic reality. The title says it all. A must read for anyone interested in political economy, poverty, or economic development.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Interesting GAME at least. I used to play on facebook and surprisingly has a few different changes to play on.
B009JCL58G|5.0|All around this soundtrack is very good. However, you're probably looking for one song and, as it happens, there are 4. These are the songs you're looking for:<br />Prelude: The Atlas March<br />All Boundaries Are Conventions<br />Cloud Atlas Finale<br />Cloud Atlas End Title<br />Played together you've basically got one fifteen and a half minute song.<br />The Cloud Atlas Sextet For Orchestra has a similar name, but doesn't sound anything like the others.<br />I hope you enjoy them as much as I have!
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|I like this app so far! getting use to the controls, but other that, the app is great! it's like I'm driving a real car in a realistic race! it's awesome and I feel like I'm actually racing! the graphics are not bad! give this app five stars! keep up the good work!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just one thing, best book ever!!! This is i think the best book of the trilogy!  &lt;3  Y A Y
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|I will definitely unlock the rest of the game.  It looks great so far and I have rarely been disappointed by g5
B00BD99JMW|1.0|So utterly disappointed. I was so excited for this third and final book. It was slow, and boring. Characters I once loved and rooted for I found annoying. Weak plot, weak characters. I want my money back. Boooo!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|No other program that I know can clean and optimize like Clean Master can. With his easy interface and quick processes this is a must have for me on my Kindle and my Samsung Galaxy phone. It is a life saver for me when my kids` Kindles run slow because it cleans junk files and even go deep in its Advanced Mode and suggest the deletion of things that are too big and aren't used often. It keeps everything running smoothly. STRONGLY RECOMMENDED.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Nice app. Nice set of stats. Nice touch with custom color for battery display. Also like being able  to be set custom alert levels. Works well on Kinde fire HD.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|This device is ok.  I imagine it will improve with software updates.<br /><br />I use this to stream videos from a university and to attend virtual conferences like blizzcon.<br /><br />Most of my use has been chromecasting from a browser tab.<br /><br />It needs to be restarted sometimes to clear up problems.  (video is choppy, does not match audio etc).<br /><br />Streaming from windows devices works better than with linux.  Linux devices with plenty of CPU are choppy.  You have to fiddle with firewall rules for it to work with Linux desktops/laptops.  As an admin, i don't understand the network broadcasting rationale.<br /><br />It needs a lot of bandwidth.  I have a low end wireless router.  You'll need fast wireless to push video to the device from a laptop.  In the end, i used wired connections for my devices to push video.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|A Good Read back to Classic Grisham.  Makes you want more of Jake and his Ford County friends and foes. I hope there will be another.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Going in, I knew this thing was going to be of limited use because of the lack of supporting apps. After thinking about what I use to consume the majority of my content, I realized that mostly it all comes from Netflix, so this dongle replaced a bulky HTPC sitting next to my TV in the bedroom. Sure, the lack of an ability to play local network content is a real bummer, but it does play Netflix and YouTube content really well. Also, app support is slowly trickling in, so it is only going to get better from here. Overall, for the price it is just barely worth it.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Seven of the many best British actors at their most enjoyable. Tom Wilkinson and Judy Dench make you cry without a doubt. Enjoy this if you respect your elders.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Best Grishom book in a while had a great twist ending well written and great to see the old characters back
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is so creative and fun. Good thinking Notch. I just have one complaint that you should be allowed to play with demo version people. But otherwise it is epic.
0345495004|5.0|Well-written, fascinating novel of historical fiction based on fact. The plot focuses on Mamah Borthwick Cheney, who enters a clandestine love affair with architect, Frank Lloyd Wright, and ultimately abandons her husband and children. The book leaves you wanting to know more about this highly educated woman who would make such a choice during a time in the very early 20th century when the women's movement was in its infancy and such a scandal could not be outlived. But since little is really known about Mamah and Wright wrote only briefly about her in his autobiography, Horan did the best she could to try to inhabit Mamah's mind make her live on the page and make sense of what she did. The affair ends in tragedy which most of us already knew before reading the book if we knew anything about Frank Lloyd Wright. At any rate, I loved the book and would highly recommend it.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This game was stunning. It had beautiful graphics and great, easy to learn , controls. And if you don't like the  controls you can change them. All around great game. Good one Gameloft!

B003WUYRGI|1.0|I didn't quite understand how this book was played out please explain. Thanks for listening to this comment I appreciate it.
B00F87ZUYG|2.0|Love the series.. these stars are actually for AMAZON.com. I had already owned three of the web views and just decided to buy the whole pack and I was charged twice fr the episodes I already owned.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|I would have liked to rate this 4.5 stars but can't. I only use 5 stars if I consider the game perfect -- in that I love it and it looks and works great. This one is close, but not quite there.<br /><br />As far as hidden objects games go, this and its predecessor is one of the best. The drawings are very well done and the objects actually fit with the backgrounds - unlike many of the other hidden objects games I've seen where they just seem to throw random objects on different backgrounds. In fact, the scenes presented in this game kind of remind me of my own house when it's really messy *smile*.<br /><br />The game provides a number of variations on hidden object games, including<br />- Find by name<br />- Find by silhouette<br />- Find pairs<br />- Find differences<br />- Jigsaw puzzle<br />- &#34;Concentration&#34; style matching<br /><br />There are probably other puzzles which I haven't gotten to yet. Most of them are fairly easy but if you get stuck there's a hint button for most of the hidden object games except for the pairs. You can also zoom and pan in some modes.<br /><br />There's also a story to it. This is where I think it falls short. Although the characters are beautifully drawn, the dialog is long and hokey and doesn't fit stylistically with the period being depicted in the illustrations. For instance, I doubt that people said &#34;okay&#34; back in ... what is it... the 17th Century? You can tap through the dialog quickly or when a new game starts, tap the menu and turn it off (but you have to turn it off every time). You don't lose any clues by skipping the dialog.<br /><br />One other reason why I am docking half a star for an otherwise excellent game is that it's almost identical to the first Pirate Adventures. Most of the characters and scenes are the same - I think I have come across one new character so far and maybe there are more -- so it just doesn't seem that interesting. It is a continuation of the story so I guess that's why, but I was never drawn into the story in the first place due to the long-winded hokey dialogue.never drawn into the story in the first place due to the long-winded hokey dialogue.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|After reading the sample of this book I knew that within it pages was a story I needed to know. All along I felt that this book would have an ending much like that of Hazels favorite book but it didn't bother me. This was one if those stories that touches you on a myriad of levels and you know-though you will never have all the answers or be completely satisfied-you will be better for having read it. So read-and notice and leave scars.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great book!  I have read every single one of his books.  I was not disappointed with any of them.  I will not &#34;review&#34; the book because I am not a professional writer and therefore not qualified.  I just know what I like.  There are few other authors that I have read all of their books, but he is on the top of my list!  They do follow a certain pattern, but I am very interested in these types of books, so that is fine with me.  If you like courtroom drama, as I do,  you will really like this book.  I can't wait until his next one!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game so much it's the best game ever it's like temple  run or subway surfers  it entertains me for most of the day. U can buy minions with the bananas u collect and there is different places u can go to by going through a magic door and its an awesome game for free download it now u will love it u will be glad u downloaded this app
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is a great app!  I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 and it totally works!  I can post, comment, add pictures from my phone with little effort.  If I use an actual camera, it takes forever!  I get a vibration when someone comments, or tags me, so I know what's going on all the time.  It runs in the background, but I haven't noticed any difference in the standby time of my battery.<br />So, if you have an Android phone, it works great.  Can't speak for other operating systems.

B008JFUS5A|4.0|While not perfect, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is that rarity among sequels:  it is decidedly better than the first film.  Credit for this achievement goes deservedly to the new team behind Catching Fire. Director Francis Lawrence (Water For Elephants, I Am Legend) brings a surer hand to the action and the pacing, and cinematographer Jo Willems gives the world of Hunger Games a feel of seamless reality that seemed missing from the first film.  But the biggest credit should go to the veteran (and Academy Award-winning) writers, Simon Beaufoy (Salmon Fishing in the Yemen, Slumdog Millionaire, 127 Hours and The Full Monty) and Michael Arndt (Little Miss Sunshine and Toy Story 3) who not only managed to produce a tighter and more vivid screenplay from Suzanne Collins' novel, they also managed to compensate for the principal problem with the second novel, i.e. that much of the plot device-wise was a repeat of the first novel. One of the most noticeable ways the writers dealt with this was in how they gave the actors more opportunities to give depth to their characters, so that even though the core dilemma was the same, the events mattered because we cared more about the characters.<br /><br />Anyone who has read the novels already knows most of the plot as Catching Fire, like Hunger Games, follows the book on which it was based for the most part.  Note: if you haven't read the first book or seen the first movie, make sure you do at least one before seeing Catching Fire. Seriously. Background is important here and Catching Fire - quite rightly - doesn't waste a lot of time on flashbacks or lumpy exposition. For anyone who's only seen the first movie, I'm going to say very little about the plot to avoid any potential spoilers.<br /><br />The film picks up things shortly after where Hunger Games ended.  Despite all odds and against all precedent, both Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) managed to survive the 74th annual Hunger Games, games in which there is not supposed to be - and previously never had been - more than a single victor, i.e. survivor.  They return home to District 12, the poorest sector in the country of Panem, thinking that it's all over.  But just before Katniss and Peeta are to start a mandatory \\"Victory Tour\\" (read 'propaganda tour') of the country for the Capitol, Katniss receives an unexpected - and highly unwanted - visit from President Snow (Donald Sutherland), who is quite angry with her for upsetting the rules and breaking precedent. In defying  the Capitol - on nationwide television no less! -  Katniss has unwittingly inspired rebellion in the districts.  Snow tells Katniss that she and Peeta must continue to pretend to be desperately in love on their Victory Tour, to preserve the illusion of government compassion, with the warning that failure to do so will result in her family being killed.  And so Katniss and Peeta set out, hoping that the tour will go smoothly. But things swiftly begin to unravel, and when the government announces that the 75th Hunger Games will be something called a Quarter Quell with a new very special rule added, they find out that far from being out of danger, the Hunger Games were only the beginning of their troubles.<br /><br />Without revealing anything else about the plot, I do have to say that Catching Fire really delivers with the ending, and the last shot of Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss just by itself will leave you itching for Mockingjay Part I to come out.<br /><br />The acting in Catching Fire definitely gets cranked up a notch, again largely because the script gives the actors the chance to bring some depth to the characters but also because of a highly talented supporting cast. Jennifer Lawrence (Silver Linings Playbook, Winter's Bone) brings a certain subtlety to Katniss, coming across as awkward and almost reluctant to be in front of the camera at times. The thing is, this is exactly the Katniss portrayed in the books: awkward insocial situations, thrust into a spotlight she never wanted, only feeling truly natural when she's bow-in-hand focused on survival, of others as well as her own. Josh Hutcherson (Bridge to Terabithia, The Kids Are All Right) remains perfect as Peeta, effortlessly inhabiting the role of the supportive and surprisingly creative nice guy whom fate continues to treat with ironic cruelty by tying him physically to Katniss but leaving her emotionally always out of reach.<br /><br />As always, Woody Harrelson (Zombieland, No Country For Old Men) steals every scene he's in as Haymitch, Katniss and Peeta's slovenly and hard-drinking coach who nonetheless actually gives them very solid advice.  I swear, Harrelson can take the most ordinary lines and turn them into absolute gems simply by the way he looks at people when he delivers them. More than any other actor I know, Harrelson seems to truly enjoy himself when acting and it really comes through in his performances. Much the same can also be said of Stanley Tucci (The Devil Wears Prada, Shall We Dance) who reprises his role as Caesar Flickerman, Panem's grandly over-the-top talk show host, who in turn was one of the best things in the first film. And special notice should be given to Elizabth Banks (Pitch Perfect, The Next Three Days) whose Effie Trinket was also a stand-out in the first film because this time around the script lets Banks bring some emotional depth to her character in subtle but very effective ways.<br /><br />Among the new characters that get introduced, Philip Seymour Hoffman has arguably the toughest job, walking a fine line as Plutarch Heavensbee, the new master of games who rose to his position after his predecessor in Hunger Games had an unfortunate encounter with some berries. The standout performances however are mostly among the veteran tributes from other districts. Jeffrey Wright (Boardwalk Empire) and Amanda Plummer (Pulp Fiction, The Fisher King) deliver as Beetee and Wiress, the two brainy tributes from the hi-tech District 3. Sam Claflin (The Pillars of the Earth, Snow White & the Huntsman) gives surprising depth to Finnick Odair, the seemingly perfect got-it-all-and-knows-it tribute from District 4. And Jena Malone (Sucker Punch) is awesome as Johanna Mason, the kick-ass attitude-to-the-max tribute from District 7. But personally I found the most moving performance was given by Lynn Cohen (Sex and the City) as Finnick's elderly fellow tribute, Mags. With no lines of dialogue, Cohen has to convey everything through her face and physical gestures, and she does this superbly, making you see what Katniss sees in her.<br /><br />On the somewhat minus side, Liam Hemsworth (Empire State) doesn't do much as Gale - Katniss' District 12 hunting partner and ostensible love-interest - but this is less the fault of the actor than it is simply that the demands of the plot don't allow him much on-screen time. And<br />Donald Sutherland's President Snow never quite seems to rise much above the level of stock villain, but this too is less the fault of the actor than a reflection of the fact that the character in the books was in truth rather sketchy and never really rose above stock villain level either.<br /><br />Overall, highly recommended as a better-than-expected follow-up to the first Hunger Games film and as a good solid action film in its own right.social situations, thrust into a spotlight she never wanted, only feeling truly natural when she's bow-in-hand focused on survival, of others as well as her own.

With no lines of dialogue, Cohen has to convey everything through her face and physical gestures, and she does this superbly, making you see what Katniss sees in her.<br /><br />On the somewhat minus side, Liam Hemsworth (Empire State) doesn't do much as Gale - Katniss' District 12 hunting partner and ostensible love-interest - but this is less the fault of the actor than it is simply that the demands of the plot don't allow him much on-screen time. And<br />Donald Sutherland's President Snow never quite seems to rise much above the level of stock villain, but this too is less the fault of the actor than a reflection of the fact that the character in the books was in truth rather sketchy and never really rose above stock villain level either.<br /><br />Overall, highly recommended as a better-than-expected follow-up to the first Hunger Games film and as a good solid action film in its own right.
B00G70WLJA|2.0|What a mess they made of this. The first two thirds were excellent. The last third was a complete mess. No surprises - figured out the big reveal way to far in advance. Absurdly long villain expositions. Absurd events that would make any Wolverine's fan's jaw drop..... in a very bad way. How do you start with such promise only to botch it so badly in the last 30 minutes?
B00992CF6W|5.0|love this game<br />it is a sandbox game were you can build houses and other creations you can walk around the world and discover new things its awesome
B008Q00088|5.0|Good all around movie. Action without gratuitous violence, dialogue without vulgar language, uncomplicated suspense. No really slow spots, quite entertaining.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|This is the best Stryper record ever... everything- is far- beyond  my expectations...each songs stands for its own. Love the documentary... YOU WILL LOVE IT EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT A STRYPER FAN----THEIR HEAVIEST RECORD.....Greetings from Valencia Venezuela
B00B0LPWU6|1.0|Totally unrealistic, ridiculously unbelievable. Way to much profanity. Although the basic premise sounded interesting, there was not even a hint of realism in the characters life relating to the aviation aspect. The movie was insulting.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|The Way of Kings is one of my favorite books.  Very good depth and some of my favorite characters in a book.  It would not be a book I would have someone start with if they are just starting to read Brandon Sanderson.  It is great and I look forward reading more in this series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is so fun to dodge trains. I love the characters there AWESOME! The New update is awesome! You should try it out.
B00E5INZ82|5.0|Just got game so far have had no problem  Just been fun.  Give it 5 stars so far playing on kindle HD
B00E9A656K|3.0|its not a really good game because they put gas in the game which if you use it all its gonna take like 4 more hours to play it again.And they also expect you to beat a guy that you need like a lamborghini to defeat him.Its a good game... just gameloft shouldn't have made it out of themselves.
B00GP0G0IK|4.0|I haven't seen a good game from G5 since Abyss  or Dark Arcana, and that was a year ago. I am happy I found this game - it's a decent point and click, mystery/adventure. There are plenty of inventory items to collect and mini games to solve, so far, no hidden object searches. The game is entertaining and moves quickly. There is a journal to keep track of everything (and it wiggles if you don't click on it), and a map which shows all the locations you have visited, and indicates available actions with an exclamation point. If you click on the exclamation point, you are taken directly to that location. This is a nice feature and saves a lot of back and forth time and having to use the hint button.  The graphics are sharp and detailed, and the voice over parts sound realistic.  I played on 1st generation kindle fire and had no technical problems.<br /><br />The free part lasted about 30 minutes, and then it costs $4.99 to continue. I haven't unlocked the full game. It was good, but a little pricey, and there are some other new releases that I would rate higher and cost less (Fierce Tales, Ravenhearst,  and Drawn) and will spend the money to unlock. I would definitely recommend playing the free part and deciding from there.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was a great book. Although it didn't end exactly how I wanted it to, it was still a good one!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Such complex characters and a compelling, powerful narrative!  I am so glad I ran across this book.  Thumbs up is an understatement.
B00BEK6Z7M|1.0|Very disappointed. I have read every Child and Preston book including the solo novels. However, I was very disappointed. The characters lacked the usual depth of characters that I find in their writings. The book felt very rushed, and did not have the &#34;quirky&#34; almost twilight zone feel of the Pendergast books. Even the setting was lackluster, and there was so much that could have been done with an old mining camp, killer bear, etc...so much meat was left dangling from the bone that it left this reader very unhappy.<br /><br />I hope this was just a one flop wonder, and does not reflect future quality of the series.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love the unexpected twists in every chapter. There is never a dull moment! Throughout the book you feel as though you are a fly on the wall, right in the middle of every event. I am someone who dislikes reading very much, but I could not finish this book fast enough!
B00132D808|5.0|Panic! always delivers. This has a much softer sound than you hear on any of their other releases, but still a classic from them.
B009ZE27US|1.0|Not as much fun as I thought it would be, kind of a waste of time.  This is a disappointing app.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|I have enjoyed the sequel more than the original, more puzzles &amp; more challenging puzzles.  It will steal away the hours of boredom.  It's a great game for t h e right price.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a very useful and easy to use calculator app. The buttons are big and easy to read. Just Fantastic!
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|This is the best game ever I reccomend this to anyone so worth the money I spent it on if you know what minecraft is this is what basically it is just with lots of mods you will be a fan with terraria buy this now its amazing!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Such a touching story of bravery & kindness. Great lessons to be learned in this tale - when bullying is such a hot topic. All kids should read this story.
B008XCJ03K|5.0|Passenger crafts beautifully simple songs with wise and heartfelt lyrics on this junior solo album. The rhymes are clever and meaningful, and the melodies are straightforward and easy. Breakout single &#34;Let Her Go&#34; is representative of the album but should not be the only song listened to; the album is loaded with songs in the same vein, songs that speak of heartbreak and hope in realms beyond simple relationships.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|So much different from the Facebook version but with the same lovable characters. You don't have to rely on neighbors to build up your kingdom. Money is easily earned by creating easy items and all them at the market. I love it, keeps me busy for a while!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Ok love this game I love I play everyday and I'm trying to spears my annuals apart and plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz make lessss money plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
B003ZSH606|5.0|Great album and I wasnt expecting it to be new so a crack or two isnt a problem. Still works perfectly and thats all i care about.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|When I read Mr. King 's works I know that I am in for a treat. His story is always riveting, characters become real and more than scary because it is human nature. Thank you Mr. King and keep on  doing what you do.
0763621803|5.0|This book was funny and interesting for my Pre-K students. I used it during our food/nutrition unit. I had found that the nutrition books from our school library were dull and dry and did not hold the children's attention so decided to branch out on my own. The children found this book funny and I liked that it presented good information in an enjoyable story form.
B00FLDG5BE|3.0|Some great performances.  Like others, I noticed quite a bit of video noise sporadically.  Check the Blake Mills/Derek Trucks track on Disc 2 as one of the worst examples.<br /><br />I have all of the Crossroads DVD/Blu Rays as well.  Gotta say that it's shocking that the producers would put out such poor quality for something recorded in 2013.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|I thought it was a learning experience, and I was very interested in the Seal training &#34;background&#34; coverage. It was that preparation which cost the Taliban so dearly for the three exceptional American warriors lives, and the injuries inflicted on Marcus Luttrell. A true story, reads like a gripping adventure, but brings home the the dedication of our military heroes like no other.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Amazing characters, sweetly evil. Gives me chills just thinking about family love. A new standard in screwed up mother daughter relationships.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Super Tooth Buddy Bluetooth Visor Speaker phone Car kit in Black works as described,  i got this for my daughter, she likes it
B00DYCBH4O|5.0|This version is wonderful the Kindle / iPhone / iPad; the linked TOC, formatting / layout is nice to read* and the illustrations are a lovely addition.<br />As to the story...an enchanting classic.<br /><br />*some versions I've given up reading on the iPhone as the layout/formatting was so poor.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is better than any other app I have played you should get it! And also you can not get Redstone when you mine it but any ways it is very awesome
0399157573|2.0|l am so disappointed that l bought this book. Again. l found the back and forth emotional stuff between Kay, Marino and Benton very tiresome. it took me FOREVER to get into the book...almost as long as it took for Kay to get from her home to the crime scene. This trend has been apparent for awhile now. Kay's emotional immaturity (as l interpret it) doesn't gel with the stronger character l got to know in the earlier books. She is self-absorbed, depressed, nasty and thinks the worst of those around her. She thinks people have an ulterior motive and  just never gets over herself. But, in Ms Cornwell's defence, perhaps that is what the book is about, perhaps this was her aim and perhaps there are readers who will enjoy this type of writing and emotional-harp-on-the-same-old-stuff story. Unfortunately, l'm not one of them
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Another one of Grisham's fabulous stories.  With some twists that add to the storyline and familiar characters, it makes for a great read.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|WOW!!!!! This is their best album since Riot Act! I absolutely LOVE this album and cannot stop listening to it!!!!! My favorites are Pendulum and Let The Records Play!
B00AREIAI8|1.0|What to say!? I just hate it I mean it's so horrible. Seriously. People,do you think this is  a good game? Well let me say something about it for you. ITS S***
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|THis item works very well, a little odd, that the movie actually palsy via the I[ad and image is then sent to tv using the CHromcast,<br />but once installed works great.<br />Little slow to boot up but then plays with out interruption
B008476HBM|4.0|A definite Jane Austen classic.  Was a little difficult to read because of the time it was written but it's a CLASSIC. I enjoyed it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I stayed up late into the night, eyes scratchy and wanting to close as I kept saying to myself &#34; Just one more chapter! I have to know what happens next!&#34; Hugh Howey is a great storyteller. The truth about Silo 18 unfolds little by little and is told through strong, memorable characters, some of whom you only know for a short while, but manage to stay with you.<br /><br />Juliette is the ultimate heroine, surviving the unthinkable over and over again (still thinking about the horror of her almost drowning in the down deep of flooded silo 17 while trying to fix the pump). The character Bernard is one of the villains of the story, with the credo that an idea is a dangerous thing, and what happens to him at the end of the book is fitting.<br /><br />Looking forward to what happens next, especially with all the other silos since there are 50!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Excellent! A great read.  Follett creates characters that come alive and intertwines them with real historic people in real historic events. Great!
B00C5R7F8G|4.0|GOOD REVIEW OF HISTORY OF THE TIMES AND THE COMPLEXITY , PAST AND CURRENT, OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS CONTROL AND THE  EXCELLENT WORK OF SENATOR LUGAR IN ARMS CONTROL.

B0085MK2GM|2.0|The plastic box was seriously cracked when arrived.  It is difficult to find a replacement box for a 4-disc set.
B0021L8V1Q|3.0|This was not to bad, I liked the first one better. I would watch it again, in fact I would watch them all again.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is sooo addictive I can hardly wait to see what the next level will bring. I also like that my friends are also playing and that we need to rely on each other to survive and advance in the game.

1451697686|5.0|I'm a 26 year old single mother of a four year old. I live in VA. I work full time and go to school.<br /><br />I am enjoying reading the reviews people are posting either posting a wealth of excuses or poking holes in every single thing that isn't eco friendly: &#34;LOOK THEY HAVE VINYL FLOORING!!!&#34; There is always going to be someone critiquing what they themselves aren't even doing. Heck our entire nation does it during American Idol.<br /><br />Read it with an open mind and don't try to do everything at once. I started reading her blog in 2011. Yes, I still bought the book (e-reader version) because instead of like a blog where the entries are written when inspiration strikes this book is more organized and does offer more info.<br /><br />When I tried this stuff I did not hold myself to all of her standards and I knew that these ideas would never take over in my home. When I got rid of all my excess in 2011 I made 2,500$ by selling it off on Amazon and got a notable tax deduction for all the donations. I also felt like I could breath.<br /><br />When I bought flour sack clothes I did with the intention of saving &#34;some money&#34; but I &#34;knew&#34; we'd always need paper towels. The joke was on me since it just struck me a few months back that the last paper towels I bought was in 2011. That was not a conscious  change it just happened because we haven't needed them. Any time someone uses them they demand to know where I got them from because they really do work that well. Our utilities have not increased at all due to washing and drying them.<br />Our utilities actually decreased because I had our city come pick up our second garbage can that we no longer needed.<br /><br />I'm using a double edged razor for shaving and now instead of spending 17$ for 5 cartridge heads I spent .37$ on a razor blade that lasts me quite some time before needing to be replaced. The first time I used it was awkward but after that it was smooth sailing. People look at it like its a rudimentary and I'm constantly asked &#34;How don't you cut yourself!?&#34; or told &#34;Well that'd be fine for the legs but elsewhere would be a disaster!&#34; Um it has a guard and no it works just fine EVERYwhere and its the first razor I've ever owned that hasn't left we with razor bumps in the sensitive areas. I'm saving a great deal of money here. A friend of mine just bought one and for the past week I've been getting texts almost every morning when he shaves &#34;OMG WHY DID THEY EVER INVENT DISPOSABLES!!&#34;<br /><br />We used reusable bags for produce and canvas sacks for ALL shopping not just groceries. We get compliments on them. Sometimes I'll get the .05 cent credit for all the produce bags because the cashier is enthused about them. I started buying the glass bottles of milk for my daughter when I tasted it I stood there stunned because I honestly had never tasted milk that good.<br /><br />It's not about living like a hippie. I know I don't live like one. It's not all about hugging trees either. I think it's about taking responsibility for our actions. We tell our kids to clean their rooms and yet when they say it's done we still check the closets and under the bed to make sure they didn't stuff anything there. How do we call ourselves adults when we're stuffing just on a larger scale.<br />Seriously, read with an open mind and try things. The money you save using the tips exceeds the price of the book--- immensely.ike its a rudimentary and I'm constantly asked &#34;How don't you cut yourself!?&#34; or told &#34;Well that'd be fine for the legs but elsewhere would be a disaster!&#34; Um it has a guard and no it works just fine EVERYwhere and its the first razor I've ever owned that hasn't left we with razor bumps in the sensitive areas.

B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I am very frustrated with this product. It's not at all user friendly. I think the worst product invented by google
B0054JZC6E|2.0|It's not really a great game but it's free. I wouldn't recommend buying coins they are easy to get. Some of the games on here are really easy but then you have some that are near impossible to beat.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|If you've played other Nevosoft games, this is more of the same.<br /><br />Plusses:<br />* The art is attractive and crisp<br />* There are variations of how you find objects, along with mini-games such as finding matches and anagrams<br />* There is a timed mode which you can toggle on and off<br /><br />Minuses:<br />* The dialogue that &#34;advances the story&#34; is virtually always wretched and really just delays playing the game<br />* The dialogue at times has typos in it<br />* The animation of the &#34;Mission Accomplished&#34; banner can actually give me motion sickness. I look away when it starts.<br /><br />If you like hidden object games, this is a no-brainer as the free app of the day though.<br /><br />I played this with a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and experienced no problems.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|I love this game. Would be great to have more crowns or a way to get more with our having to buy everything.
0062107313|2.0|A dedicated Amy Tan fan since her debut novel (which, though it was published a year before I was born, I revisit every year), I traveled to the Valley of Amazement already spellbound, anticipating the same sentiments that Joy Luck delivered.<br /><br />I was disappointed. At the risk of publicizing my oversentimentality, I also felt betrayed. I pre-ordered the novel and waited patiently, checking my mailbox every afternoon. And though I could only read a few pages a day because of my graduate program, I kept thinking - hoping, certainly - the story would pick up, a redeeming epiphany would alter the book's tone, something would make the characters more likable, more human, more compassionate. I waited for the language to become less tedious, the grimy details of Shanghai less depressing, the flower/sex references less tacky. Like the patrons of these courtesan houses, I spent the whole novel waiting at the cusp of this valley and searching for what I desired most. But I never found it. Just like the patrons, I found illusions, cheap embellishments, shoddy furniture, and cheap, cheap, cheap sex.<br /><br />At Tan's defense, I get it. Sex sells. \\"Fifty Shades\\" is a testament to that, among so many other empty \\"pieces of literature\\" that will never stand in the same light as the classics, the unrecognized talents, the Nobel Laureates, the Pulitzer Prize winners. True literary minds, true English enthusiasts, scoff at works like these - they shame us, embarrass us. To use Tan's own terminology, good literature - true, honest literature - is like a first wife. And cheap, repetitive sex scenes, empty characters, and stale plot - these are all slave girls. I am sad to admit that I finally saw the day I'd scoff at an author I idolized and admired most. I have placed the valued Tan on a pedestal since I was teenager, and \\"The Valley of Amazement\\" tore down her pristine standard. I never imagined I'd want to STOP reading Tan. But I spent nights with this book dreading reading and re-reading tedious, silly passages that told me nothing of the characters at all, just courtesan rules, dry dialogue, and repeated questions from the protagonist that essentially answered themselves. Again, as Tan would put it: \\"I didn't understand. Why was the book so bad? Had I been duped?\\"<br /><br />Some reviewers say they enjoyed the book because of its historical context, its realistic and sometimes shockingly honest portrayal of Shanghai in a time of revolution and change, and I understand this and agree with it. To Tan's credit, the book does provide a rich history and vivid backdrop to the characters' lives (although a few details did make me lose my stomach, the girl really did her research). The characters themselves, however, were as flaccid as an old patron's \\"stem.\\" They were essentially faceless. Violet is a spoiled brat who has to learn about life the hard way, her mother is hard-hearted for having endured atrocities, Fairweather is a slimy con man. The patrons vary, but according to Magic Gourd, they will all enjoy more or less the same behaviors in bed, and there are rules to get them there that will never fail. I could never make a simple list like this for \\"Joy Luck Club\\" or \\"Bonesetter's Daughter.\\" What gave Tan appeal above all else was honesty. Good, honest characters. Characters that you can't forget easily, that haunt you to come back and reread. I am upset to report that I finished Tan's latest book an hour ago and I feel like I've already forgotten the lot of these contrived personas already. I was happy to press cover to cover and call it a day.<br /><br />Amy Tan was the first author to inspire me. I never thought a female artist of color could gain so much success by telling our stories - immigrant, minority, mother/daughter stories. American stories. Chinese stories. I was enchanted, and for this reason, I will always be grateful for Tan - I will always love her and admire her as an artist. It is not my place to say if the book was good or bad, only that I disliked it for all of the reasons I've mentioned already. Tan, you are BETTER than this! You don't need cheap sex to sell. I would have fawned over a more thoughtful story with rich, diverse characters, multifaceted symbolism, and meaningful relationships with less of the historical research monologues. I almost feel like Tan sold her body herself with this book.<br /><br />I understand that artists experience varying phases in their careers. Tan is at a different place in life now than she was in 1989. She was inspired to write this, to tell these courtesans' stories, to shed some light on Shanghai during the 20s. I applaud her for her efforts, but frankly I think the book is a waste of time and money if you are seeking a read like \\"Joy Luck.\\" This valley really will amaze you, but perhaps not the way you expect. But who knows? Maybe it will bring a new crowd of fans to her readership, who will pick up \\"Joy Luck\\" expecting something like \\"Valley,\\" and thus, be disappointed! Different strokes for different folks. I only hope that Tan returns to her roots for her next piece. There is a reason her debut novel was so successful; if I were in her shoes, I'd take that fact to heart and build from it.as good or bad, only that I disliked it for all of the reasons I've mentioned already.

B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This is a fun game. You are able to explore the kingdom. Rescue hero's and expand your land. I wish you were able to earn crowns but if there is a way i have not yet found it. You do start out with 100 crowns but after those are used you must  purchase more.
B007PTJOV0|1.0|Leps world is  a fun game but whenever your character dies, you need to start from the beginning even if your on like, level 20! I also think it is a recreation of mario bros and its basically the same thing. I don't really find it the best game, but still you should not get this game! DON'T WAIST YOUR TIME PLAYING THIS STUPID GAME!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is so amazing! I am so anxious for the next book! I highly recommend this book for ages 8+
B00GH4R95C|5.0|I'vee seen them all. Loved Christopher Reeve. But this reboot has more depth, more gravitas, more character development and far better overall acting and special effects than any prior movie. The opening sequence on Krypton - with Russell Crowe - is beyond 5 stars. I regret not having seen it in the movies. Thank goodness for Amazon and my Kindle Fire. Great quality picture and immediate download.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|The book is good until the ending. I think it could have been done a lot better. Just not what I needed from the book.
B000RPCK1U|5.0|This is the hardest Brosnan Bond to find and I needed it to complete my collection.  The image quality was excellent and it arrived a day earlier than I had expected...always a plus.
B001BANK32|5.0|Loved every page of the book, definitely keeping it to read again and again! And looking forward to the sequel!
0307719227|3.0|Thought provoking views from somewhat revisionist authors. Provides responses to authors such as Jared Diamond  on the one hand and early 20th century establishment stalwarts. Worth the occasionally repetitive commentary.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Such a fun match game requiring stragegy.  Can be really frustrating when you get so close to completing a level and miss by one.
B00CWIMVDW|1.0|HANNIBAL IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE BIG SCREEN PRODUCTIONS, AND I'M SPOILED BY VISIONS OF ANTHONY HOPKINS, THE PERFECT GHOULISH CANNIBAL. THE STAR OF THIS SERIES HAS NO PERSONALITY, AND HE REMINDS ME OF A WET DISH RAG. HIS PERFORMANCES ARE VERY FORGETTABLE.

B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Warning,  Dont be Deciieved the game is not FREE it is $$$$!  You constanty need to buy lives and boosters.  OK.  I had fun but some of the early  games are near impossible and you need to play them 5, 6, or 10 times; solution - buy more lives and boosters, annoying.  You can go on the web and find ways around spending, but why, developers greed.  I may never get to the more fun difficult games, sad and frustrating.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Having fun playing CC but I think when you get stuck on a level for so long it gets sorta discouraging and I can't even see me ever passing level 100.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|I understand why more conservative Christians object to this book. It's definitely not orthodox. But even if you're not conservative, it's not great scholarship - makes lots of claims with little to back them up.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The entire trilogy is awesome!! A really easy read....captivating. The descriptions of events make you feel like you are really there.
B003L77G38|3.0|Season 1 left me with a cliff hanger so I immediately had to get season 2. Season 2 was very good and getting interesting so I immediately bought season 3 (blu-ray).  Season 3 seemed to get a little too weird for me. There seemed to be too much jumping around into the 2 universes and then 15 years into the future.  After &#34;cheating&#34; and going to imdb.com and seeing what is in store for seasons 4 and 5, I'm not too sure I will be getting them.<br /><br />My Blu-ray player seemed to have a little trouble playing these Blu-Ray discs. (makes me hesitant to buy anymore blu-ray discs)
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The first book made me cry, and it made me really happy. The others are not very good, but I still think they were amazing
B007A2O3FO|5.0|I actually bought this as a gift and have not seen this movie myself. However, the recipients HAD seen this movie and they were VERY excited when I gave them this movie. They said it was excellent. I have yet to see the movie myself but I will take their word for it.<br />At the time I bought it, I did not know they had seen it (I never heard of it) but it sounded interesting with a good cast, so I thought it was something my friends would enjoy.  They told me I made an excellent choice.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|The storyline was interesting, but the only thing that we actually enjoyed about the movie was Brad Pitt, who did great.
B006FPFTMS|5.0|I won both the mobile version and the PC versions and I much prefer them over adobe. Foxit is light and faster.
B006DICWUE|5.0|I am betting that I'm in the same position as many, many other middle aged males who grew up in the 1970s and 1980s listening to rock, hair, acoustic rock, and proto-metal . . . when our favorite artists never let us down at a live show and whose songs linked up to, enveloped, and defined the singular moments in our lives when we felt immortal and triumphant.<br /><br />And now our jobs, our families, our mortgages, and our car payments have taken over in a way that makes finding new music--especially defining music that can elevate us above the routine--almost impossible.  Corporate music is forever trying to bring us back to the contemporary versions of our heros from 30 years ago (do you really want to pay $150 to see the Eagles in 2013?  Do you think there's a single track on the newest Aerosmith CD that will change your life?).<br />Do you have time to find new artists that can wake you up during a morning commute with satellite radio, Pandora or, Rhapsody?  I challenge my 18 year old son--a musician who seems to prefer the 60's, 70's, and 80's himself--to bring me new material . . . but it all sounds derivative of the great stuff I grew up with.<br /><br />One recent morning, NPR rolled &#34;Looking Through&#34; into my speakers.  That was it.  Somehow a contemporary band had synthesized the 'feel' of so many of the killer pop songs of the early 80's.  Couldn't believe I'd never heard of &#34;Nada Surf.&#34;  Perfect harmonies, shimmery guitars, exceptional production values, song construction combining killer hooks, multiple tempo changes (without ever sounding contrived or clunky), and (best of all) lyrics that never got in the way of a good hook.<br /><br />I went back to listen to the entire 10 year catalogue.  &#34;The Stars are Indifferent to Astronomy&#34; is the one seamless Nada Surf CD.  Every track is good to great (how often can you say that about a CD released in the past 20 years).  If there's one complaint I could come up with, it's that it's almost too much of a sugar high.  At times you can feel 6 years old chewing your way through a huge cotton candy ball on a 10 minute roller coaster ride.<br /><br />I will say this . . . my only vice as a mid-40s family guy is my 1996 Nissan 300zx.  If I have a few hours to myself, taking off the tee-tops and blasting up into the mountains on a sunny day with Nada Surf turned all the way up makes me 17 again.  Every time!<br /><br />If you partied back in the day to early Elvis Costello, Tom Petty (before he incorporated), early Pretenders, the Cure, the Smiths, Modern English, the Plimsouls, etc . . . make this investment.most too much of a sugar high.

B00CHS31DG|1.0|Kind of a lame app. Wasn't impressed with the &#34;paranormal activities&#34;. More of a joke app than real thing.. I can't believe people think this app is real
B00GQ7OPG6|3.0|Actually, Hannah is not in episode 1 but somewhere in the season. Sorry for the error. Still recommend the episode as well.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Certainly one of his best books! Not the usual horror stuff, but a lot of psychology and mind-bending concepts that will have you thinking for quite a while!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I will echo the sentiment of other reviewers and say that Doctor Sleep did not hold the terror that I found in The Shining. It was however, a masterful Stephen King work. For those readers of King who have been disappointed over the years by his change of writing style you will not be disappointed in Doctor Sleep. King magnificently develops the adult character of the little boy so many of us were left thinking about for so many years and provides closure to his story. This is the King I loved so many years ago.
0375413405|4.0|The cover of the cook book has dark stains on it in the lighter area, although it is supposedly &#34;new.&#34;
B007T8BYWE|4.0|Love this game.  It forces you to use logic.  I just wish there was more content in each release.  It does get more difficult a you go along but again my pet peeve with all the versions I have played is that each game is too short
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|Great uplifting movie.  I would watch it again.  Great behind the scenes movies at the end too.  They are quite long though.  I didn't get to watch everything.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Definitely worth getting. If you haven't played it, or even if you have.  Great game had to look and Yep just just like my fb version so having fun
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book s as interesting as the first book. It held my interest the whole time.  Can't wait to read the next book.
B00CHVJODE|5.0|A must see for the whole family! Great movie for kids & for adults! Nicolas Cage is hilarious, one of his best movies ever!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The Mall is super fun it is the best place that that have made. You should get the game. You are missing out on fun
0205313426|5.0|The Elements  of Style is easy to read, straight to the point, and is written with clarity.  The book is one of the best books I've read on English grammar.
B00EUUJID6|5.0|If you like il volo, you will the love this Christmas album, traditional Christmas song given a new sound by the this wonderful trio.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Typical Stephen King follow through. I love the way he takes your mind back to those long winter days and nights in the Overlook hotel! One of my favorite reads from my favorite author! A must if you loved &#34;The Shining&#34;!
B00A6CCF0K|2.0|I have come back to it a few times but just can't get into this book at all.  All of his early books and most of his later books have been great.  This, in my opinion rates with the the group of &#34;forget it&#34; ones he has written.
1476751935|5.0|Excellent! Can open to any page on any day to find a great inspiring quote!<br />Like it's predecessor without having to sit and read at length.<br />Used in an office waiting area and well received by clients and staff!
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Good game a little confusing at first to play.  Not to hard once you learn what to do.  Fun to play.
B00B2PHSIY|4.0|Not really designed for snorkeling or other shallow footage. However, the image clarity is great deeper that 5 feet. Otherwise, it's just bright red.<br /><br />Since it does say SCUBA in the title, I'll take the blame on this one.
B00B8YSIMY|5.0|I have said before in a review that I have always had a twisted fascination with the dark side of life and how a normal person, even a “good” person, can get sucked into addiction and fall into a world of destruction. Get Clean was another shining example of this. It begins with the main character, James, at yet another down point in his life, receiving a sudden long shot opportunity that sparks a ray of hope for a new job, sobriety, and a new shot at beginning again in a place far away from his problems. But in this book, as in real life, he brings his issues with him, meets up with the wrong kinds of people, and his world spirals out of control.<br />Get clean takes the reader on a journey through the vicious circle of addictive behavior, while never losing sight of the humanity behind it. It shows James not as a weak or evil person, but a person with deep seeded pain and guilt. It holds onto his humanity as his struggles with the very things that make him forget his pain, cocaine and alcohol, only cause him more. And it shows how even the kindest soul can get taken in by the cruelest sorts of people. Intense, honest and hard hitting, Get Clean will keep you in your seat, turning pages.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|It's fun, if you don't mind waiting for things to finish! You also have to wait until you get enough crowns (unless you want to pay actual money) to get things like the dragons.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|pure drivel…unimaginative, boring….i couldn't finish it….i just don't see what all the commotion is about….if you want a good book, read Justine
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Once I finally got immersed in this book, I couldn't put it down. It will take a while for me to stop thinking about it. The way the paths of the characters lives unknowingly intertwined makes one ponder the hidden course of their own.
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|Overall a pretty fun app!  I like the graphics and the challenges are fun.  I don't like that this goes along with facebook, but if you don't have an account - you can still play.  It is hard to find neighbors when you don't have a facebook account, but you can find some. I like the variety, but it takes a while to &#34;build&#34; the items that are incomplete.
B00B19G01C|5.0|Awesome! Great movie, great story line, great all around!<br /><br />I love a good horror movie and this one does not disappoint.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|um. What just happened? Does anyone else feel like Allegiant was out of a totally different series? I remember Tris so well from the first book, her struggle with who she was and who she became, but it seemed like a different character here. I think it's plausible that if this were a real story, that much shift within a personality could take place, but that's the thing– it's not a real story. And this much shift just makes for the very sad, very frustrated, and summarily negative review.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I know people who have completed and those who have tried to, but have not been able to finish their hiking of the Appalachian Trail.<br />So I was very interested in Cheryl's entering into a hiking trail situation without having any idea of what it entailed. I had never been aware of the Pacific Crest Trail in our country. So I enjoyed her journey from both the point of view of how it physically and mentally  was beneficial to her state of mind.
0316322407|5.0|There's something superhuman about this phenomenal young woman.  Her father's pretty special too.  I hope this sparks a shift from pushing pink princesses on our daughters to exposing them to more powerful women like Malala!  If you're too busy to be your own child's hero, here's one!
B000002H70|5.0|a perfect sequence of songs, a piece of art that has to be experienced all together. Try it with headphones, and loud: it is magic.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|i got this for my kids, they tried it for a hour, then took it off, they did not like it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Once again, John Grisham did not disappoint us!!!<br /><br />I have always said the definition of a good book , is one that you continue to absorb , think about and re-hash in your mind , long after you have finished reading it.<br />So true with this book !!<br /><br />Thanks again for the entertainment !!<br /><br />Chris of New Orelans
B000I0QK74|5.0|Beautiful choice for Christmas.  It is not all traditional music, but the ones that are, are beautifully done.  Very folksy
B00FVS4EUI|1.0|Could not get it to play after buying it. It charged me quick and just fine but buffered for hours to watch
B00AOMR2S2|4.0|This is a great collection and amazing acapella. If anyone wants to really hear the background voices and beats within each song, this is the best way to get there.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I like the app,but I think that the app is kind of slow. The app is nice, I would play it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I've been wondering what had happened to Danny & his Mom ever since I read the Shinning at the age of 10 and scared myself (in a good way) for life. This book was more than I could have ever dreamed it would be. Stephen King has out done himself once again. I can't wait until Christmas this year, my youngest daughter who is 12, is getting her first Stephen King book. I'm going to apologize to her in advance for getting her hooked on something she will never get enough of. ;)
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|became addicted quick. I play on my Kindle Fire and love the game. Even compare progress with friends. Can't believe I enjoy the game.
B005LJETYI|5.0|It was a really good read and every day he repeated was different so it wasn't boring or seem to repeat the same scene over and over!
B00BEIYMIS|2.0|Scary?!  Really?!  If you like stupid cheap scares maybe.  As with Amityville Horror...lets have all kinds of bad things happen to our family, yet still stay in the house.  Easily scared?  You may like this overly long movie.  Looking for an original, real scare...skip it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive but time consuming in a brain rattling , move patterned game you can't set down. I find myself battling with my kids to see who has climbed the highest ladder. Amazing.
B00D3LA5WG|4.0|Ahhh...a well written, well acted, low budget movie with a decent story!  Matt, in my opinion, is a great actor.  Sam Shepard gets better with age.  Reese...well she may be the best of all.  Then there's every other actor in this movie....all good.  If you're a sucker for a guy/kid strong bonding relationship movie, then you have it all with this one.
B00D48BSBA|4.0|FF taking off from the Afghan, very interesting and fast paced. Forsyth really knows his stuff. The plot is well researched but FF seems to be in a hurry here and it shows. Cannot relate with the main protagonists as in his other books so only a recommendation for a breezy neutral read and full value for your download!
1455525839|5.0|It was great to have another Pendergast novel and it was very good. I've finished it and am giving it to my sister who is also excited for another Pendergast novel.
B001AT4Y84|3.0|Ok here is the thing; I know alot of people hate this movie. It is not the best of the Terminator Movies as a matter of fact it is the worst of them but the series needed an end and I always thought the second one (Which is the Best by the way) cheated a little. This one gives a fitting end. The series (Trilogy really) ends the only way it really could have the only way it should have and no I won't spoil...the rest is well passable action not horrible but nowhere near as memorable as the first two.
B0036S4B6M|1.0|Typical inmate account of prison.  The inmates are all so brave, thoughtful, wonderful etc.  The staff and the system are all so unprofessional and indifferent.  Please.  You could write another book on all the things she didn't mention that she and the other inmates did.  She would never mention that because this book is all about the prideful inmates of Danbury and the big, bad mean staff.
B00G32OER4|4.0|I am not quite sure how to explain this movie and not give too much away. It needs to be noted that this is a highly Christian themed haunted house movie; not that that is a bad thing but it does need to be noted. It is not ghosts that are haunting the family but demons. Witches are bad. If that turns you off well then this movie really isn't for you. Personally I didn't mind the demon thing. The witch thing gave me pause. Other than that this was a pretty good horror movie with geniune scares. I felt for the family which is all I can hope for in a good horror movie.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|A great read, really liked the fact it was such a different plot line. And it was fun returning to the town and characters of his first book.
B00GINENG0|5.0|Great fun when you are bored  it really just plain awesome I recommend  it to everyone and anyone that just to have a good laugh with/without friends.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Really cool but wish the control was as good as dungeon Hunter 3. But at least keeps me and my brother occupied.
1442337966|5.0|The best book on cd I have read in a very long time! I totally love this and would recommend it to everyone. I purchased it in the book and cd forms to lend out to friends
B004MC8CA2|3.0|At first, this was a WONDERFUL app, as my church used the LIVE app. Lately, we(my husband and I) cannot use this in church. Even after updating and reinstalling, it won't allow us to use the LIVE app.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I thought the was good from the story, special effects etc. The story (SPOILER ALERT) is a combination of Superman Birthright, Superman God fall and Superman Earthone. If you are not a comic book geek may have thought it was entirely original.  Either way I it was a great blend. I just wish that the film makers would give more credit to the artist and writers. Like Kryptons costumes are based the late Michael Turner story God fall and Soul fire
B000QQFKYE|1.0|i did watch this withn some good friends. we bought refreshments and food that was absolutely delicious. we knew it would be a long film. when it was all over the only question was: what was the blue box and key all about?
B00C2U6G7C|4.0|For the Zimmer-haters...  please move on...<br /><br />I have always liked Hans Zimmer, and, several of the composers that have worked with him over the years.  As with any composer, etc...  you have things you like and don't like.  That's the way things are.  Nothing is perfect.<br /><br />With that said...  MAN OF STEEL is tons of stylized fun for fans of the composer.  Slick themes, pounding action and rarely a dull moment.  If you are a fan of the Christian Bale BATMAN films...  scored by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer...  this is definitely for you.<br /><br />Great packaging too.<br /><br />A score that will grow on you.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's hard to put this one down!  Many updates with more levels added!  You can connect to Facebook and ask for assistance from friends for more lives or you have the option to pay if you just can't wait!
B003G4W49C|3.0|The story was interesting and was building up to a climax, but all of a sudden it went past before you knew you were there.  After that was just a quick thumbnail outline of what could have been an interesting second part of the story...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers it's just so fun I love the challenges in the game and I play the game every where so yeah my cousins LOVE the game and I do to
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game makes you think enjoying the different levels of play and challenges I will be playing these escape games for a long time. loving it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Breed feed race buy win Dragon vale is the best of games I recommend it for all ages . Best free game ever it doesn't even matter if you don't like dragons. Get it if you don't you will not be satisfied. If not Dragon vale at least get something related too it like animal voyage.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|this book calls you to do what you came here for.<br />What every artist, creator, entrepreneur, writer, doesn't want to read, but totally should.<br />enough excuses.
031623480X|5.0|For anyone concerned about your health I HIGHLY recommend you read this book-It gives the science of LCHF in a way that is easy to understand.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Action around every corner!!! Keeps you coming back for more! Can't wait for the next book! Never thoughts queens could be so evil.
1476727651|4.0|I loved the Shining (the book, not the movie). Interesting to see what happened to the survivor(s). Over the years I stop following Steven King's works but he seems to be getting back on track as far as holding my interest.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|6 stars !<br />We just got our first kindles. We bought the new HDX 7's. I was hoping there was a way  transfer files wirelessly because connecting the cable is sometimes a pain with our Win XP machines that dont always recognize mass storage devices so easily. Of course mine worked fine thru the USB on both PC's...but the wifes wouldnt work on either...go figure.<br /><br />I read about this app on a website and tried the free version and it definitely seemed to be working so I paid the buck for the pro version.<br />Best money spent so far on an app. Works perfectly at transferring files to and from the kindle HDX just as expected.<br /><br />Well worth the money....<br /><br />edit...<br />Even more surprised to find that I could open the app on the wifes kindle, then open the silk browser and be able to move files between our kindles directly. Not sure how often we'll use this ability but its nice to know it can do it if we need it to.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|All functions tried have worked well. Simple things formulas and text formatting work as well as those provided by MS Office.
B000Q6GXW2|1.0|when i got my package, everything seemed fine until i tried to play the video in multiple devices and it didnt work. corrupted disc.
B00GME9AJK|4.0|Follows the book pretty well, ends too soon. Doesn't finish the story or show the social impact of this great man.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great quick read!  Good story you have to  pay attention to keep the characters and stories straight no reading and watching t.v. with this one. Enjoy.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Spoiler Alert!!!!!!! I was so looking forward to Allegiant coming out and I read it in a weekend. I found the changing in voice confusing - I would often have to go back to see if it was Tobias or Tris narrating. But that I could have forgiven. What I can not forgive is the ending. To have Tris be killed makes me never want to re-read any of the books in the series - why get invested in Tris when she doesn't make it in the end? I don't even want to see the movies now - and I was really looking forward to them as well. I would like someone to re-write Allegiant with a more satisfying ending.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|What a story...what a story! From the first chapter it is non-stop excitement and keeps you asking \\"what's going on?\\"  I loved this book! If you like suspense and non-stop action you will want to read this book.
B00EDF43MY|4.0|Not as cute as other Dr. Panda apps.  A little harder too.  My 3 year old can't do the luggage &#34;maze.&#34;  I'm not sure why they needed an Arab raccoon - to make it PC I guess?
B001DJLCRC|5.0|This is the best drama I have ever seen, it has some of the most intense scenes ever. Virtually flawless
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A magnificent sequel to a classic book, and due to pop culture.... a great sequel to the very, very frightening movie.....  Starting out only 2 years after the Shining, but getting us to the adult Dan Torrence reasonably quickly, Mr King does a great job of introducing us to the new &#34;good guys&#34; and evil ones....  I really like the directions this book took and since I've finished it, I am not ready to start another book, because I can't stop thinking of this one - a classic sign of a great book in my mind.  Usually, I would re-read the first book in a series like this one, but I have seen the movie so many times, there was no reason to in this case.<br /><br />A stand alone story - but definitely made better by knowing the back story....  some of the references still made me shiver..<br /><br />Thank you Stephen King - you are on a roll dude...!
B00881VLCE|5.0|Great puzzles beautiful art work, hundreds to choose from ....these are true jigsaw puzzles. I wish more game creators would offer these instead of sliding block style puzzles that they call jigsaw. Highly recommended
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love playing this game on my Kindle! Thanks for a simple game that doesn't freeze or lock up all the time!
1416596585|4.0|Interesting anecdotal perspective on the founding of Google. It gave me a lot more respect for Schmidt and Page. Highly recommended.
B00C5R7B0I|4.0|Loved it, but parts were technical and got boring. Also a little too descriptive for me but it was very very good.
0736083863|5.0|Very clear and easy visuals a great book for the participant and the teacher. I would strongly recommend this book
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I'm always looking forward to new books by Grisham. Some were a disappointment (e.g. The Broker), but this one was very good. A bit similar in idea to &#34;The Testament&#34;, but has its own twists. It's also good to meet familiar characters from &#34;Time To Kill&#34;.<br />All in all - recommended reading.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|It is really great to stay in shape with! Sometimes it is a little fast, but I can get past that! Highly recommend this app! :-)
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I've been waiting a long time to play this on my kindle.three weeks into the game and I'm so addicted.
B0000027RL|5.0|Jeremy...evenflow...all songs on this cd are awesome! totally raw to the bone jams the best of pearl jam...in your face tunes!!!
B002VQ7PVS|5.0|I've loved William Boyd ever since I saw the Masterpiece Theatre production of 'Any Human Heart.&#34; He has never let me down, and IMHO does not get the accolades he deserves.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Ok i first downloaded it since like months thinking it would work again and it didnt even update and ive been seeing all de comments and i agree with all of them cuz all they said it was true it was awesome at first but i downloaded youtube pro and ifs an awesome app still works  and then youtube free stopped workin aouldnt even turn on :/
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I enjoyed all three books and only hope everyone can see beyond the cruelty and violence to the victory of good over evel
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a really great game again like temple run or subway surfers .I love this game,it is great for kids.
0596522347|5.0|When I got this book, I was working for an intl telecom, teaching and speaking, among other tasks. I really enjoyed the perspective--it helps speakers (along with &#34;Reasonate&#34;) to critically analyze the abilities from an artistic viewpoint. That is to say, too many business speakers focus on the glossy presentation to carry them but put little thought into content and delivery.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a good game for kids and adults.my kids love this game so much.they say that is is their favourite game
B000JMKRKC|5.0|OMG, this was beautifully written and quite creepy.  I was pulled in right away.  I suspected early in the book how the story was going to end, but because it was so well written, I read for the pleasure of the words and story, not for the suspense.
B0015DRPJU|5.0|Excellent series with tons of romance and action. The whole series was excellent, highly recommended fun read for anyone who loves vampires and/or romance.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! I do enjoy Temple Run but this is better. I think almost everybody agrees with me right?
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Immensely captivating.  You just don't want to put it down because each level is more interesting and challenging than the last.
B0086700CM|4.0|I like it. I think that its a great game for everyone. But I also LOVE subway surfer. So 4 stars.
B005HED11Y|5.0|I have always been a fan of Star Trek and haven't seen it for many years.  With Amazon Prime, Star Trek is at my fingertips any time I want to watch it.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|So much fun to play. Wish it could load a little faster but I guess my eyeballs could use a break ;)
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Absolutely Astounding!!!! This book really grounds you with the Energy of Spirit that is within you and around you! The Author teaches you how your thoughts create everything that is happening around you.  What is best about this book is that she teaches you about the energy and how it is created.  I recommend this to anyone who is wanting to expand their awareness in unforseen ways, and how to use the magic that is within our very grasp.
B000WQWPKA|5.0|This is a well acted classic, with the special effects enhanced with the blue ray edition. Robert Redford and Glen Close work so well together.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|A great journey to &#34;self.&#34;  I liked this book because I could see the growth of Cheryl Strayed with every step she took and every lesson she learned through trial and error.  A little redundant in parts but the story was brave, honest and compelling.
B004RUF9DC|5.0|Thanks to the wonderful acting and realistic settings, the story never falters, but, in fact, remains a classic well worth watching again and again.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This app is very good for keeping a tab on my battery so worth my ninety nine cents. I will recommend it to someone who likes to know what is going on
B001JAFYFG|5.0|One of my favorite films made even more exciting thanks to the blue ray feature.The mythical qualities remained undiminished. Peter Ustinov's novel interpretation of the old man really works. The principle actors are wonderful.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|I love terraria and I'm trying to get it on kindle fire but it wont work. it says error all the time when I try to installit it. I already payed for it.
B00FLDG42Y|5.0|Been waiting for this since I saw the concert almost exactly 1 year ago in Phoenix where they recorded 3 of the songs.  Rush really has the live recording thing down, and this album demonstrates that.  There are no discernible overdubs on this, and according to the band there are none.  On the CWA songs the string section really adds something nice to the recording. Alex's solos really shine, particularly Analog Kid, Force 10 and Headlong Flight.  The 3 drum solos are awesome and Geddy's bass is typically Geddy - Clean, tight and intricate.  On a few songs Geddy sounds like he is straining when singing, but, well, that's Rush.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who likes Rush.
B001L9OKZK|5.0|Fiver, a small rabbit who suffers from visions, tells his brother Hazel that they must leave their family warren because danger is coming. So Fiver, Hazel, Big Wig and others leave their warren, the only home they’ve ever known, and branch out to find a new home. Along the way, they encounter enemies in the forms of other animals and their environment. But nothing could prepare them for the meeting of the General and his band of tough rabbits. Will this brave group of bunnies find the home they need? Or will nature get the best of them?<br /><br />Loved.<br /><br />I don’t know why I waited so long to read this book. My father in law gave me his copy years ago and told me that I would love it, but like many books it winds up in my To Read pile and takes forever for me to find it again. Besides it being a wonderful story, I think Dad gave it to me because we have two bunnies of our own.<br /><br />It’s more than a children’s story as Watership Down carefully weaves the beautiful tale of loyalty, friendship and bravery through the rabbits’ quest for survival.<br /><br />The rabbits are characters to be admired, with all of the depth and warmth of real people. The story moves quickly, having this brave group encounter rivers, foxes and dogs. And the end is perfect. I may have been crying in the car, listening to the audiobook on the ride into work. It is a children’s story but that didn’t stop me from enjoying the adventures and challenges that the rabbits faced. The tale has themes of folk lore and religion, morals of stories sliding to the forefront during the tales of their rabbit folk hero El-ahrairah. I loved the chapters of the El-ahrairah stories that were interspersed between the main plot.<br /><br />Audiobook is very well done. Read by Ralph Cosham, I downloaded it from Audible.com. His reading is slow and holds you close, like a father telling a good night story to his children. It captivated me every car ride.<br /><br />Brave Big Wig, cleverHazel and sweet Fiver. All the rabbits had distinct voices and personalities. I loved their relationships to each other and how they worked together to achieve their goals. There’s a reason why this story is a long time favorite.<br /><br />What are you waiting for?<br /><br />Forget that it’s a children’s book.<br /><br />Enjoy the beauty of the story and get lost with these rabbits as they search for what we all search for.<br /><br />Home.<br /><br />Rating 10 One of the Best
B00DYMM76Q|5.0|Beautiful music typical of Vince Gill.  I have loved every album I've ever purchased of his, and this has been no exception.
B00DGL3IKY|5.0|Absolutely Amazing! Kreator is my second favorite band in the world after Megadeth and my favorite band out of Germany.<br />The CD/DVD were outstanding and the performance was much like the one they did when I saw them live on their last night in the US (which happened to be in my area) It was also THE best show I had ever seen and will never forget it. This set shall remain a milestone of a happy moment in my life!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Works well on the Kindle Fire HD. It's so nice to see the weather and have it at your finger tips when making plans
B0058VA2U4|1.0|What IS this?? I used to like this band. I do think they are the biggest joke in all thrash metal but their first four albums were at least decent. This is not a thrash album. I can't even categorize it. Hopefully they will call it quits after this. I would rather listen to plain silence than this trash.
B008J2GAKU|4.0|An intriguing story with a fine mix of action, myth, mystique, and lore. Ancient secret societies are not the mega villi and or common thugs I usually associate with a Batman enemy, but this was so nicely done and set up that I can't wait to dive deeper.
B000WOT41K|5.0|I have never been below the surface of top 40 with the Cranberries, by that I mean I would hear the most played and I liked it. I read some reviews that said their first three are must haves, and down hill from their. I now think more that he/she was attached to the message and when that changed so did his/her opinion. Unfortunately I am growing more attached, after hearing this albums songs, (which means I probably will Buy the albums). This is the risk you take when buying a greatest hits album, Sometimes it satisfies, other times you double up by going back for all of it, If only the bands got more of that money, I would feel right about it!
B009ZQJVAK|5.0|Absolutely funny movie taking you to an uncomfortable zone with great characters.  Movie is not predictable nor is it too over the top with the characters being portrayed.  Great music throughout.
B0011U5E1S|5.0|As a review, This is coming from a very superficial listener. I was in San Francisco when the movement came, and I didn't get the buzz (I was shifting between jazz and progrock at the time). Later when the meaning clarified, and Nevermind came out, I became aware. This is a great introductory album for the unfanatical. It carries with it a great sampler of all you need, when \\"You do know what it means\\", but don't have the gumption to buy chronologically all of the albums to hear the progression as it developed, (Like I did with Little Feat and Ani Difranco). If your a fanatic, this is how I suggest you experience any band. A very good album.
1451695195|5.0|This is a super book for those wanting detailed medical reasons.  It is a bit technical, to my liking.  Hope he writes a second book going into more details.
B007MDB71O|5.0|2012 was a year of blockbusters for franchises in Hollywood.  There were major successes like Avengers, Dark Knight Rises, and the first Hobbit film.  Then we had several movies that were intended to start franchises, but performed so poorly that the franchises-to-be were put on hold.  In no general order, they were John Carter, Prometheus, and Snow White and the Huntsman.  The first, John Carter, is based on the novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs, one of America's greatest writers of science fiction.  Featuring a big ensemble cast full of up-and-coming stars, great special effects, a good story-line, and what should have been a big fan base, this movie almost flopped at the box office, leading to some turnover at Disney's corporate headquarters.  The end result was a quick transition to the home video market, where it has found success.  This two-disc version is one of several versions available for purchase, and for those without a 3-D capable TV, this is probably the best choice.  The movie quality comes across quite nice from beginning to end.  The film itself is beautiful, and is probably the best role so far for Texas native Lynn Collins.  Watching this movie, one can see that many of the top sci-fi films of the past 40 years have been inspired by the Barsoom series of novels.  For example, Collin's character, Dejah Thoris, is clearly the inspiration for Princess Leia.  Likewise the titular character of John Carter seems a good template from which to start Han Solo and Luke Skywalker.  All in all, a great movie.
0156030209|3.0|It takes a long time to get into this book, or at least I thought it did. I wasn't truly interested in the book until about the 200th page (it was a requirement for my children's literature course so I had to complete it if I wanted to pass!). However, once it got past that dry beginning, I thought it was amazing. The entire plot just came to life and amazed me. I had come to dreading it but after it got to that 200-ish mark, I was definitely intrigued.<br /><br />All in all, if you like background knowledge (a lot of it), you will probably not fall asleep during the beginning like I did. If you like action more, try watching the movie and then reading the book.
B00407PNWO|5.0|Great classic story!! Wonderful acting! Breath of fresh air to watch and enjoy with the entire family without fear of anything inappropriate for my younger children!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is fast and puts the bible at the palm of my hand. I highly recommend this app to anyone who loves to read the bible!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Really enjoyed the book. Felt like you knew the main characters for years. Great read. Would<br />definitely recommend this book.
B005JABU82|5.0|i love this real grade freedom gundam but the bad thing about this kit is that the wing is kinda loose
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|minion rush is awesome super fun and there are so many cute minion costumes you can buy the best part is you can unlock so many places and the controlls work very well.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|Excellent movie.  Liam at his finest.  A real bad-*ss who will go to any length to protect his daughter.  You'll just have to see it to appreciate his character and unique story line.
B000002KCF|5.0|If you listened to music throughout the 1970s /1980s and beyond, you will recognize the production values on this album. One of the underground classics of the time, it was up there with the cool albums only the cool people had (Trout Mask Replica, Original Recordings, Can't Buy a Thrill, Remember the Wind and the Rain, Eli and the Thirteenth Confession, Birds of Fire, Last of the Red Hot Burritos, Spartacus, Friends and Strangers, Sad Eye, Tumbleweed Connection ....), It's for a light mood, a weekend afternoon, a promising weeknight date, a free Sunday mornin'. The infectious nature of this album seals its place as the most fun a turntable can have with nothing but tea!
B001AVCFK6|5.0|If you are a Trekky fan, you should enjoy this movie.  Lots of great special affects and loved the story line.  Even has Leonard Nimoy!!!
0525478817|1.0|I read this book, because all of my friends really enjoyed it, but I thought it was really boring and highly overrated. Augustus and Hazel are very annoying and aren't realistic teenagers at all. I found that I couldn't really relate to them at all. Also, I'm a teenage girl, therefore I do enjoy books that can make me cry. I read lots of reviews saying how touching the book was, but tbh I didnt even cry once. and no one my age, or any other age speak like the way those characters  do, always saying boring metaphors which was probably the author's failed attempt at humor. I also felt that the plot was a bit too predictable because I just knew that either Augustus or Hazel would die. I stopped reading about halfway through because it bored me to tears and made me want to sleep. I don't get why anyone would like reading this book.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|I like a movie that doesn't give away the ending. The plot was not predictable, which kept my attention. Always enjoy watching Denzel Washington and John Goodman.
0141394811|1.0|An unreadable mess. Books need editors, and this pile of garbage exemplifies the point. Morrissey is quite the wordsmith in small lyrical chunks, but this does not extend to the autobiographical book form. I should have put the damned thing down after I struggled through the first five page single paragraph, but I have a certain nostalgic affinity for the old tosser. I read more, and &#34;Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now.&#34;
B009VLXWRC|4.0|Really liked this movie. I like history and vampire so putting it together (even though the idea of Abe being a &#34;hunter&#34; seems a little far fetched.lol) is my kinda movie.
B000EVKWYY|5.0|This is the just like the book I had as a child. It was my favorite. I will be passing this to my grandchild and I hope she loves it as much as I did. Great seller and fast delivery. Very satisfied.
0385537131|5.0|Amazing story….I couldn't put it down … John Grisham is always good, but this book was 5++ stars.  I would highly recommend it.
0345529057|5.0|One of the best series I have ever read. You get so emotionally attached to the characters! Winter is Coming...
B00F91SCXC|5.0|nice movie for zombie lover. love the 3d effects, good movie to watch at night with love once.ha ha ha
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|completely useless<br />the speed is slow<br />support is terrible<br />wish I had never purchased it<br />and now I can not return it
B00FPH6M82|5.0|good movie in high definition, 5.1 surround sound, super clear. good movie for the family and friends. specially father and son
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I love this game I can play a little bit each time until your energy runs out then you can either purchase energy or wait awhile until it recharges patience is the key word
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|great movie for people who love robots and monster characters, good movie to watch with kids and friends . .
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|Was a gr8 reboot to the superman franchise.  Employing quality actors and investing some time and creativity to the beginning of the story in Krypton added to the depth realism of the story.  Was well done and kept my attention throughout.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|I like billiard type games and this is a good one.  Like playing against other online players.  Might need a stylist in that it makes fine adjustments easier.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I've read the comments of excited women captivated by the sexual intensity of the book, but there is more to this book then just sexual fantacies. The story of two very distinct people attracted to each other by their differences and finding solace and romance with each one another has a very deep meaning in the book.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Love Lee Child and Love Reacher!  Story is wonderful, exciting, a bit funny.  You can see Reacher in your minds eye, strong, capable, hard core and takes no crap from anybody.  He's all in for the underdog and never, ever tell him what he &#34;cant do&#34; because that's what makes this story line so cool, he wont mess with you unless you mess with him first.  It's fast paced, good read!
0393327655|5.0|Excellent book, after reading this you'll realize how practicing Islam is like looking back in time at the 14th century.  Author also goes over the holy inquisitions too.  These ancient books have no use for today!  Some ideologies are very barbaric and should be banished!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I like this version MUCH better than the Facebook version. The one on Facebook was constantly freezing up on me, but this one doesn't. The graphics are really good as well.
B002RI9PKO|5.0|Greatly recommended AAA read!<br />Great plot; unexpected ending.<br />One of the best recent material I've got hands to enjoy.<br />Must read
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|so glad to have this on my kindle now!!! now I can keep up 'on the go'. thank you app world love to use on my treadmill.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|I grew up on the comics and old re-runs, and of course the ones with Christopher Reeve. While I enjoyed them, I wasn't a big fan of Superman Returns. However, this movie was great for a reboot. A twist here and there of cannon, but nonetheless, for an action / superhero movie, it does well. If you thought X-Men Origins: Wolverine was awful, then feel free to rent this movie, as it is nowhere near that bad. Good acting for the most part, as well as the dialogue, and Michael Shannon is friggin great as Zod. Not as good as Heath Ledger's Joker by reboot comparison, but c'mon - that's a tough act to follow when reviving DC villains.<br /><br />I myself will more than likely go ahead and purchase it, since it wouldn't be bad to have on the shelf when I feel the need to watch a moody, dramatic outtake on Superman.<br /><br />***SPOILERS******<br /><br />I only give it four stars because seriously, SERIOUSLY, it annoyed the piss out of me that the guy leveled the city. I mean, take it away from the millions of people and over billions in property, you supertit. But other than that, it's a good movie.
0307744434|5.0|The Night Circus is truly enchanting.  Exquisite storytelling.  Rich with fascinating characters.  A brilliant premise and beautifully descriptive.  I almost pity the next novel I pick up.  This will be a tough act to follow.  Many thanks to Ms. Morgenstern.  I could not have enjoyed it more.
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|The flashbacks and earlier parts of the movie are great for origins-story lovers. Faora-Ul was my favorite character, she got to represent the most badass parts of the evil Kryptonians by the way she moved and the action scenes shot got. Although, she also got the worst dialogue in the movie, &#34;evolution always wins&#34;...? Kryptonian powers have nothing to do with evolution...they have to do with what happens when a Kryptonian lives on Earth, for a number of years I might add. So aside from the non-sense that General Zod's people would achieve the same level of super powers as Kal-El while only staying on Earth for a few days, the simplistic idea behind that particular line of dialogue is insulting. The movie is too long also.
B000WMEAKC|5.0|One of my favorite albums. Amazing price for such a good album. Love amazon auto-rip. Will buy all my music on amazon.
0345803485|4.0|I know this book is a &#34;Best Seller&#34; and a movie is being adapted from it, so I wanted to read it before it came to the cinema.  I just started and have found the characters to be very well developed.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|One of my favorite albums. Amazing price for such a good album. Love amazon auto-rip. Will buy all my music on amazon.
B000P0J0A6|5.0|Love the movie. Great price on the DVD. My daughters are obsessed. Play this thing over and over again. Holding up better than expected after their abuse.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME: I downloaded this app because I love Josh Groban's videos and Catholic songs videos such as \\"Make Me a Channel of Your Peace\\".  This app hasn't worked at all in over two weeks. All I get is the message, \\"V-Tube has stopped working.\\"
1781162646|5.0|The Good: I had expected a straight crime novel based on the publishing line, so I was overjoyed to find King had managed to sneak in some supernatural elements. Very nostalgic, in a good way. King certainly sets the scene well and I thoroughly enjoy a good carny story - which are harder to come by than you might think. The mystery is solid and I did not figure it out before the big reveal/showdown.<br /><br />The Bad: Nothing at all.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Intriguing. Entertaining. Clever. Excellent acting. Great set ups and discoveries. True to the original, in the modern day. Highly Reccommmend.
B00C7DGQ9C|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie. We didn't think we would at first, but we were impressed! Glad I purchased it instead of just renting it! Great action packed movie!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This could have been just horrifying. It was. And it wasn't. There were so many nuances that one never thinks about when hearing about someone being held captive. I will not mention those, because they would be huge spoilers and one should discover them just like I did.<br /><br />This was also a book club read. Four days after our bookletta meeting, the news broke of Ariel Castro's kidnapping and imprisonment of 3 women (and the child of one of the women). Having just read and dissected 'Room' it was almost surreal to read fiction turning to reality. 'Room' made their ordeal just a bit more understandable.<br /><br />Although the subject matter would seem difficult to read and digest, Emma Donoghue dispenses with the most horrifying of a horrifying situation.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Love the game slot better then the old ones also love that so far it not absolutely necessary to spend money to get further in the game like most of the tablet games
B003ODIZL6|1.0|WORSE THAN THAT IS THE WORLD OF THIS ARTICLE WAS FIRST PUBLISHED BY CLIFFORD THE FIRST PLACE IN THE WORLD
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is really good. and awesome you shoud get it. it is fun really fun super fun like temple run
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I am not much of a reader, but this book definitely made me one temporarily!! The story is so captivating you will not want to put it down! Can't wait to start the next book!
B009O07NMA|4.0|This is a great CD, and most of their songs are very good.  I enjoyed it and I'm sure others country music fans will too.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|I think the game is ok. This is running kinda shaky on the kindle so I am a little disappointed with that.
B00466HM28|5.0|No problems with it at all. Extremely useful tool for Fl Studio and any beginners for that matter. Comes with everything you need to get connected via USB midi cord.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Love that you can play the game even when offline.  Lots to do to keep interest in the game for me as well as my daughter.
B00FLDG5BE|5.0|Just finished watching the 2013 Crossroads guitar festival and thought it was awesome! I love how the show was done with Eric getting things started and sharing the stage with some very talented musicians. The best is how they finish it all; they entertain you throughout and blow you away with guitar playing of different styles from so many talented people but then Eric comes on for some of his solo work and you realize why he is &#34;The Guitar God.&#34; How can you not enjoy the way he does Crossroads or Sunshine of your Love? Highly recommend this DVD for any Eric Clapton die-hard fan.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I love this game it's so fun I can't stop playing it.<br />My sis told me to get this game I'm glad I trusted her you should get it to
B000XUBFE2|5.0|reading about the atrocities from the German point of view. so sad that one man could hurt so many people.
B005HIBWFW|5.0|The movie is uncut, compared to the version in cinema for general public. The quality on the movie enhenced in HD is superb and the sound is awsome, highly recommended.<br />The cut scenes are very sad and it is for an 18 of age public.
B00D6BU8GG|1.0|If they set out to kill this franchise via satire they have succeeded gloriously.  John McClain in Moscow to find his Superspy son?  Painfully bad from beginning to the 33 minute mark when my wife and I gave up after an aggressively obtuse McClain utters, for the dozenth time, \\"I'm on vacation\\".  By this point he had outed his son as a spy, torpedoed his operation and done more damage to the Russian capitol than the Germans did to Stalingrad in 1942.  If you feel compelled to watch this, try Gigli or Battlefield Earth instead.  How they followed arguably the best chapter of the series with this steaming vat of offal is beyond me.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Bond saves the world again.  It is nice to see that he is still able to do so as he gets a little gray around the temples.  Typical dangerous stunts and edge of your seat recoveries.  Enjoyable.
B00G32VYDG|3.0|Poorly warmed over Men In Black.  Jeff Bridges did this part with a mouth full of partially masticated chicken livers for effect and I think the fact that I couldn't understand a word he said actually improved my viewing experience.
B00EVW0SA0|4.0|This action adventure thriller provides two hours of entertainment allowing complete escapism.  Very similar in plot to Olympus Has Fallen.  This film is not an intellectual exercise, but a fun way to spend an evening.
B00AQSF6BO|5.0|Excellent, very melodic music, with different instrumentation, great musicians, very nice addition to stand out in your music collection!<br />If you are tired of the same old thing, give this a try..
B002BRRTUO|3.0|The acting is over the top, the scenery is chewed with aplomb and Queen did the soundtrack, what's not to like?  So a good movie but a fantastic bad movie. We'll worth seeing for its badness.
0887307280|5.0|I found the first one &#34;after&#34; I had a business that failed... I was the technician that succeeded in creating the business but didn't have a clue how to move it along.  This is a good book for getting real with yourself and defining /creating a &#34;business plan&#34; as far as what to develop next.  It give a realistic picture of what you need to do to create a business.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Having watched the first few episodes I feel like the plot writing is up to par with the original series and the actors are faithful to the original characters.  It took me to the second episode to warm up to the Doctor and at this point I can fully embrace the legitimacy of the reboot series.  It's nice to see this series continue.
1401938906|5.0|Was looking to be re-inspired to believe in manifesting good.  This was just the ticket and I think the organization of the book is very good... succession of it.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|I've beaten the game up to region 4 and it will not advance to the new regions. It's there an update I need to do? Fun game but kinda boring to keep doing the same contract hunts over and over
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I read all three books.  I read more for curiosity than anything else.  They were OK, but I have read many books a whole lot better.
B009MYARIK|4.0|Comedic madness, and Sophie Kinsella does it very well.  I felt as if P. G. Woodhouse might have been looking over Sophie's shoulder and whispering in her ear \\"Come on Sophie!  At least 3 more plot twists - you can do it!\\" and \\"That action is over the top - of a small hill - get that character over Mt Everest ! NO! Launch her into orbit!\\"  Very few authors can surprise me with multiple hilarious unexpected plot twists involving multiple characters catapulted out of everyday common-sense behavior into a lunatic dimension of ever increasing levels of silliness the way Sophie Kinsella can, and I enjoy every second of it.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|It was a fairly good book.  I had never read this auther before.  The charactors were very believable and entertaining.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is sooooooooooooooooooooooooo fun I wish it wasn't that hard to make and kill things I always try to make a bow but once I made one and I didn't have any arrows and I died but my point is it is sooooooooooooooooooooooooo fun :)
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I read the entire series,  It was ok I was more curiious than anything.  I don't think it was worth all the hype.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|exciting,keeps you on edge.l would recommend this book to anyone.I have read all three of these books and had a hard time putting them down.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Perhaps the best comment I can make about this book is how it obviously sets up the third.  A quick read but enjoyable.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham has been MIA for a few years now.  This book was like he found himself and starting writing again.  It was a page-turner from start to finish.  Excellent, excellent book
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great but I do think there needs to be more activities and challenges...and I also think some stuff should be less coins especially for the younger kids... because it's harder for them like my little bro...
B002ZLAHE6|5.0|I love this film.  It's fun, up-beat, and has great humor with good acting.  I've watched it several times.  Unfortunately, the most recent time I tried to watch it, every 5-6 seconds either the audio or video would drop out.  We were renting the HD version.  After about 12 minutes we decided decided to bag it and watch something else.
B009CVRQLY|5.0|This is an awesome album. I have never bought a CD from Dion, heard two songs from this and I was SOLD, I LOVE THE WHOLE CD!!!
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat. Loved the landing then the tension even gets heavier. I could even watch it again.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I was introduced go this game by my friends and t thought it was silly childish  until  I decided to try it for myself. I'm now hooked . I love it.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|I love this game I just want them to add world<br />Wide multiplayer and this is what I think about terraria
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|Hands down one of the best movies of the year!!!<br />Unlike many make-believe movies that Hollywood is pumping out, this one hits home dealing with issues of truth, justice, responsibility and accountability.<br />Denzel never disappoints and the rhythm of the movies is almost perfect. WATCH IT!<br />Great cast, Great story, Great director!!!
B00GINENG0|5.0|When I got it  I thought it would be boring so I got it to prove how boring it was but when I got my little Tom ( Evan) I fell in love with it and my brother Evan!
B00EVW0VTI|5.0|Relevant, believable, great action, intense and engaging drama & ending, even better than Olympus Down.  Great script. Recommend to everyone
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|fun at first but I'm stuck at 50. no explanation of how many helps I need to go further. more information on how to play the game.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|Great action & acting, especially from the 2 stars; good continuation/conclusion of the series.  Great script & scenery.  Clean romance
B00EMGUT1I|5.0|Lemmy and Co. smash it out of the park yet again...classic Motorhead energy with some very cool unexpected surprises.  Killer CD, and a must have for any Motorhead fan!
B00B0LPWU6|1.0|We like Densel but could not get past the first few minutes of this movie without seeing a naked woman parading back and forth in front of the camera and foul language! Very disappointed.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|I chose this book because of the ratings and it did not disappoint!! It's a murder mystery with a great plot, a little romance on the side and not too smutty to make it ridiculous. Try it! You'll enjoy it too!
B004HO6I4W|5.0|My girls love this movie. It is very cute and has some very catchy music so it keeps them entertained.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Very bugging device...It only cast at the lowest level and even then does not work.  i have been emailing back and forth with Google support now for 11 days.,<br /><br />When it works great...but just tried restarting it 5 times and just getting a black screen, I have reset my network updated firmware on my chromecast and router. Tried multiple computers etc.<br /><br />When it works I will be very happy to buy one and use it daily right now I think I am going stick with Roku.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed watching this.  Loved the entire cast and it really followed the book.  Can't wait for the next one.
0984999302|5.0|This is an amazing book and methodology. I've done a number of successful start-up and acquisitions. This year I won the E & Y entrepreneur of the year. Yet, I learned many things that would have saved a lot of time had we used this process. Even more importantly, it would have saved many mistakes by &#34;getting out of the office&#34; earlier before spending time and money to create solutions that were not important to customers. What a gem!
B002M2N9JI|5.0|Simply awesome!  If you love 80's music, you will love this too.  A wonderfully consistent CD, every song is great.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My eyesight id not good so it's  finally a blessing to have a bigger screen than my phone I'm even more addicted to the game thanks
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is addicting all of my friends at school played this game :-) I give it  a 5 star because the game is addicting and you would want to play it every day
B007SGLZP8|4.0|If you like Grisham's style of story telling you will enjoy this book. Although farfetched, the story is engaging and keeps you turning pages.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This app is habit forming,  but the ads can be annoying.  You just have to wait for the chance to skip the ad and get back to the game.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|Very strange movie!<br />We didn't even watch it.  Nice costumes but really, really veird!  Dond't rent it.  We would have taken it back if we could in one minute!!!
B009PAETCG|1.0|You know why it's free? Because it either freezes or crashes completely. I got it for my 5 year old autistic son and he hates it. I'm annoyed that I have to give at least one star. It isn't worth any
B00CL68NOG|5.0|Funny movie and cute relationship between the mother and son.  I thought it had a good meaning, cute message and pretty realistic.<br />It got me to laugh and brought few tears to my eyes as well.<br />Recommend it for moms that have grown up kids (I am 45).<br />I nice good feel movie :)
B00FAVRHBE|5.0|Just saw the 50th anniversary episode on BBC America.  It is totally brilliant.  The writing is amazing.  Moffat tied the 12 (yep, I said 12) doctors together seamlessly.  I will be ordering this dvd so I can see it over and over again.
B004SGWYVA|5.0|This is a TERRIFIC series....can't wait for more!!! This series has wonderful character development and a GREAT story!! We hope you enjoy this anime!!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This  app is fun and keeps you interested. Definitely a game to kill time.  My<br />daughter really likes it also.
0385537131|5.0|Mr. Grisham has outdone himself in this novel.  It was terrific to have updated information about the characters from A Time To Kill.  Heard John Grisham on the Diane Rehm Show on NPR and it was insightful to hear about his writing process.  This sequel was extremely satisfying with its red herrings and suspense.  Mr. Grisham's new novel is only second to my favorite, The Painted House.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|It's wonderful great for kids and adults!kids will have A Blast playing the game!adults come play this game if your awesome u will like it! :)
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Although I had seen the first film, I hadn't remembered the details.  It was helpful to view the entire trilogy and glean more information.  Christian Bale played a unique Batman and was excellent in the role.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I can't remember when I have read a book that gripped me like this. If I didn't know better, I would have thought this was Stephen King writing under a pseudonym. The author has a mastery of the almost-horror genre, if that makes any sense. Her ability to describe brutal acts without making the reader close the book is unnerving... again, very much like Stephen King. I won't describe the plot, but the structure of the book alternates chapters of current  events with chapters relating events on the day of the crime, so the reader uncovers the truth in the final pages. Again, one scary lady and a great read for a long winter's night.
B00881VLCE|3.0|Great stress relievers until the last couple weeks when I can't get the page to work to view and download more puzzles.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|I don't play a lot of these games,but enjoy them for a change of pace. The sound effects are pleasant the items work well. I'll probably check out the other one after this.
160774418X|5.0|Such a wonderful cookbook.  Recipes are a bit involved but the results are worth the time.  Weekend cooking-- not for every night.  Very healthy recipes.
B004DK5CYM|5.0|Great Movie & it's sweet on Blu-Ray. This is by far my wife's favorite movie. I had to order it for her.
B00ES27W7K|5.0|This was a wonderful book! The characters were well rounded and the story complex. The story had been told at a leisurely pace, but the end felt hurried and &#34;there now it's done!&#34; attitude.  Everything was tied up, but I was a  little disappointed by it's brevity. Will certainly look forward to her next adult book.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Great read I can only hope the movie does it justice . I really liked this one . I highly recommend it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I'm giving this game a 4star rating because I don't believe one should have to keep paying more and more money just to play a game. I'd rather pay a set price and have accesst to all the lives i need for no extra fee.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|kept my interest throughout.  Can't wait for the next one.<br /><br />I was truly sorry to see it end. Anxious to get the next in the series.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|Follow the adventures of Jack the Pirate through hidden object games, word scrambles, matching puzzles, 'find the difference' scenes, etc. Ample hints are provided and the timer can be turned off, making gameplay fun and relaxing. Most of the puzzles have a zoom and pan feature. Music and sound effects volume can also be adjusted or turned off. The scenery, characters, objects and backgrounds are detailed and picturesque. In addition, the storyline is engaging, but you can also touch on the word bubbles to move it along more quickly. All features run flawlessly on my Kindle Fire. All in all I would recommend this as a top-notch, well-designed, very enjoyable game.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|Fantastic first album. The Shakes are interesting, unique and a lot of fun. I gotta say this band is a breath of fresh air. Definitely excited for their next album.
B00EP0SIOG|5.0|Frankly I'm torn between really cool, and flashy but useless. However if you're not in need of a real robot that will vacuum your house, but something you can tinker with, this is a real nice choice.<br /><br />The basic functionality is simple. This is a gyroscope powered remote controlled ball. There is a mobile app for Android and iOS devices that allows you to remotely move, turn, and jump the ball (yes it can jump by itself). If this was the only functionality I would have called it expensive for that it does. Fortunately there are many other uses.<br /><br />The first thing you realize is that there are around twenty more applications in the app market. First of all you can play variety of AR games, where you combine real life rooms, with on screen zombies, and so on. And what positively surprised me is that the control is two ways: i.e.: not only you can move the ball around, but you can use the ball as a &#34;3d joystick&#34; for some games. Rolling, turning, tapping the ball can be mapped to actions in games, which brings extra utility, and some more coolness factor.<br /><br />For people who really like to tinker with robots, there is an API. Not much needs to be said about this, except that it's a great thing not needing to manually reverse engineer its protocol.<br /><br />Overall if you're looking for a toy for your children to follow around, buy a Roomba or Neato, they are more useful. However if you really like to try cool stuff, this would do nicely.
B006BXT4TI|5.0|Fantastic stuff again from The Black Keys. These guys rock hard and remind me a bit of some of the classic rock bands of the past. This is a great album and I can't wait for the next one. I'm happy to support these guys, even though they're getting some big airplay these days.
143350393X|5.0|I always love the ESV version translation! And the explanation is very clear and the best part is you can access the online for free.
1452101248|5.0|One of the best cookbooks out there; vegetarian or not. I'm not a vegetarian, though I cook a decent amount of vegetarian food. The photos are outstanding, the recipes are interesting and unique, and the stories are fun to read. Ottolenghi is one of the best cookbook authors today. Many of the ingredients are pretty standard, though he uses some rare herbs and spices that you might need to make a special trip for. Overall, this is one of the best cookbooks of the last few years. I'd really like to check out his other books now.
B001C34HUS|5.0|Young lays out a simple process for creating beginning with the &#34;research&#34; phase which I constantly overlook. You could create a business just from this book
B00GIXWXEO|1.0|It was a poor imitation of the movie &#34;Cars&#34;.  The writing was very poor.  I was very disappointed.  This should have stayed in the studio.
B00DJYJPLO|5.0|I love the 'Before trilogy', and this movie is the best of the three.  It is getting Best Movie and Best Actress Oscar buzz (also best director, screenplay and actor), all well deserved in my opinion.  It's not required that you see Before Sunrise and Before Sunset first, but doing so will put Before Midnight in better context.  Caveat:  it is almost exclusively talking, so if you can't enjoy an movie sans action, it's not for you.  But if you have a romantic nature you will enjoy these movies.
B000SEIBB8|5.0|This book should be required reading for any object oriented programmer. Even if you learn nothing new from this book, it gives a common language to more effectively communicate with peers.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|A very good game sometimes difficult some times not it is really fun app worth downloading.:)<br /> #1<br /><br />Really really good
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|Cornwell has published so many bad books in the last years that I was excited to find the beginning of this one got me hooked.  Unfortunately this fish spit out the hook midway and found that her bait just wasn't that tasty.  Sorry Kay!  As one of cornwell's early fans, I acknowledge that I've grown older with Kay, Lucy, Merino and her hubby and its possible my fascination just isn't what it use to be.  I think our divorce may be final.  I am giving this one the benefit of 3 stars but only because I am not able to give it a 2 1/2,
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|This is a great way to pass the time at work  . I play this game all the time. I would like to no what the circle  euros are.
B00CDTSFF8|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this TV series. Well written, beautiful cinematography , and very real characters in this time period. Worth watching particularly if you enjoy The Game Of Thrones series. Bravo History Channel
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game has taken so much of my time. I just can't stop playing it. Even though after a while my eyes start to hurt. Enjoy the game.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|This novel is a masterpiece, the plot, the characters, the twists, all the genius that I have come to expect from Brandon Sanderson. The 4 star is only because after reading the Mistborn books I expect everything Brandon writes to be as incredible, and while this comes very close, it's not quiiite there.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Love the game better than the one on Facebook love the graphics fun game.has great features and has no problems.
B00FAEPX9Y|2.0|Not the full song, it cuts off at 2:03.<br /><br />I love the song, but can't stand that I paid full price for a partial song.
B002HFP0QU|4.0|Pretty good mix of BEE GEE songs. Enjoyed happy memories when listening to the &#34;oldies&#34;. Would recommend highly for BEE GEE music fans.
B00FXEL00W|4.0|Loved the story thank you<br />So many of us can relate to falling in love with best friend. I enjoyed every chapter
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|I absolutely love this game not very good yet but I keep playing it cuz  it is so addicting don't want to put it down your kids will love it to the graphics are really good  very good game I recommend it
0399157573|3.0|I've had \\"Dust\\" on my nook for about 9 days and only on page 115. That's 7 days too long for me and PC.  I'm a 2 day reader.  I've fallen dead asleep after reading a few pages every night!  I would strongly recommend coffee and daytime reading only with this one.  So far,I'd say about 80% of what I've read is pointless jabber.  Please get better Dust, please get better......
B00ECUARO8|4.0|My wife insisted that my son and I watch this movie.  Since the plot and cast have been discussed elsewhere, let me say that this is worth your time.  No, I don't think this is a great movie or an academy award nominee, rather it is a good movie worth the watch time, and . . . it will make you think.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The pace never lagged and the insights into the deceased's motivation were revealed slowly and with great impact. One of Grisham's favorite plot devices over the years has been filthy rich old men knocking themselves off and leaving nothing to their greedy, obnoxious heirs. Good stuff!
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Didn't care for this game at all. Instructions were vague. Visuals were nice. I want to uninstall it. Happy day.
B00B5HQLMI|2.0|It doesn't have the spirit of fun of the old James Bond. The stunts were not as over-the-top or spectacular as expected in Bond movies.
B00992CF6W|4.0|please add more animals, islands, volcanoes, mountains, and more... I wish you could have pets in the game where you can put a collar on them and they are yours and then you can breed them for babies.
0688170528|5.0|I have  read several Jodi Picoult novels & have completely enjoyed the story-lines in every one. I ordered several novels at the same time, that I ordered this one & have yet to read all of them. I take my time with novels & savor them, for weeks, thoroughly enjoying getting to know the characters. I picked Jodi Picoult novels that I have either been told are wonderful novels, or I felt by reading & getting some insight from other authors who gave a review. Anyway, I fully intend to read, each of the Picoult novels I recently bought & there are others, I plan to add at a later date. She is an AWESOME author.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun and challenging game. real 3D imagery and larger screen size makes it easier to see the different combination of options .
B00594XOZU|5.0|This app is the best unfortunately though I accidently deleted it from cloud and now I can't use it anymore which makes me sad
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|It is ok for a time killer. It is kind of boring. Hopefully when I get into the higher levels it will be better.
B009APMNB0|4.0|worked great and good price very happy with this item. would suggest to others who are looking for something that works without a big hole in pocket
0316245283|5.0|The changes from B&W to color (and back) are very well handled to designate when the main character is in the &#34;normal&#34; world versus the world of the Peculiars.  Ms. Jean is also excellent in conveying emotion and story even in passages without dialogue, in fact this seems a particular strong point in this book.  Warning: some of the monster scenes may be a bit too spooky or frightening for very young children.  This is not a book to read to young kids at bedtime.  But you would already know this if you read Mr. Riggs' excellent original.  This graphic novel is a very successful transformation of the written word to a visual medium.  It even uses some of the photos in the original book to great effect.  A very nice, beautifully bound book that feels like a quality product to hold and enjoy.  Highly recommended.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|I enjoyed this book. Fast paced and hard to put down. I generally read books in order, but it seems this one is earlier than the others in the series.  Started reading them after the TV series ended. I was sorry to hear it was not coming back for another season. It was a really good show.
B004EPZ03E|5.0|I'm not going to play the role of film critic here; all I can say is my daughter loves this movie. She was a big fan of the first two movies and she's not disappointed with this one. It might be her favorite of the three.
B0000508U6|4.0|This cd has many great songs but I don't think is a rock album, it's rather a pop album and I like good pop. Plus guys looking not looking for romanticism go somewhere else. This is a couple album.<br /><br />Let's cut the strings of the parachutes<br /><br />The best songs in  are:<br /><br />1.  &#34;Don't Panic&#34;  8/10<br />2.  &#34;Shiver&#34;  100/10<br />3.  &#34;Spies&#34;  7/10<br />4.  &#34;Sparks&#34;  8/10<br />5.  &#34;Yellow&#34;  100/10<br />6.  &#34;Trouble&#34;  100/10<br />7.  &#34;Parachutes&#34;  1/10<br />8.  &#34;High Speed&#34;  7/10<br />9.  &#34;We Never Change&#34;  7/10<br />10.  &#34;Everything's Not Lost&#34;  100/10<br />11.  &#34;Live is for Living&#34;  8/10<br /><br />Vini,Martini,Vici!
B00G9QLP9Y|2.0|Wish it came with instructions!  Couldn't quite get it to work!!  I am semi-computer literate, and guessing that a lot of potential users would identify with that - need to draw me a picture!
B005LAIISA|5.0|Niece & nephew loved it. Heck, I did too. Rented one evening when babysitting and we were all entertained. Highly recommend.
B00GME2NCG|2.0|Horribly disappointing version of Jobs' story, since it focuses only on his flaws and not on his brilliance or what Apple actually achieved. If you don't already know details of his family life, you can't follow it as presented. There is almost nothing included after his return to Apple. I thought we were getting the Aaron Sorkin movie, but this was not it.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Had to rent the video to see what all the fuss was about. Now I'm hooked. Fascinating storyline and interesting imagery. Not just for those into fantasy.
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|It was a straight forward, unpretentious action movie; it has good action and a good plot.  I just wish they would have had more of a back story for the Dredd character. Also, I thought it would be a remake of the Stallone film but this is more of a new adaptation of the Dredd comic book character.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is so fun and addicting,  it is fun for every age! some levels are challenging but I love it.
140006922X|5.0|It is an interesting take on the actual, as far as can be determined with as little knowledge of the time in real time as described by Josephus, agrees with the non official biblical data recently discovered, can be written neutrally.  This author, Professor Aslan really did his &#34;homework&#34;.  And as a further &#34;proof&#34; of his diligence, the table of contents and asdribed to refrences listings was as large as the actual book.  I find my curisoty itch has been successfuly scratched.  Thanks for the opportunity.  Thanks ..Fred
B000RLFJQ2|3.0|The video portion was not up to par.  Audio was better than usual. Content was good and we enjoyed it.
B001C08RHA|5.0|Great movie, although I found it hard to believe Robert Downey Jr was really in the suite all the time, I gave the film a thumbs up.
B000GCFG7E|3.0|Very interesting reading....Jack Reacher is good.  I have been reading Lee Childs stories this year and have found them exciting and interesting. I am looking forward to finishing the series.
B001DHXT20|5.0|I like this movie, but The Hulk was better, in that he got bigger as he go more challenged he became. But I was sorry they had to pick on NY again.
B00AF82WTO|5.0|It's slow moving, however the movie show scenes the TV does not show.  I really enjoyed the movie. Now I want to read the book to see how the book and movie are similar.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|The Avengers was a great movie, I was sorry Colson had to die, but the movie itself was great.<br />I hope a sequel is in the making.
B00GO8Z8H2|5.0|Really makes you appreciate the history of this fantastic show, amazing film!<br />The cast and story are very well done!
B00E5I2M9K|5.0|This movie was very good. But I never understood why Loki had to wear a coat, as a god, he shouldn't have gotten cold here on earth, since he didn't get cold enough to wear a coat on the ice planet.
B004ELSDZK|5.0|Enjoyable little puzzle game.  It looks  like all the  one star reviews complain that it's &quot;too easy&quot;,- clearly these people didn't play past the first few levels that exist simply to walk you through how to play.  It gets exponentially more difficult farther on.<br />Very pretty.  And joyous day; no ads.<br />Will buy from this developer again.
B007KW5MFE|5.0|The wonderful thing about his movie is Blade could take on dozens of bad guys, but he gets caught out by his own mother.<br />The problem with that is he was too young to remember her, but he did. She called him Eric. I was crazy about the blade he used in the beginning of the movie.<br />I even felt sorry for Whistler.<br />This has to be the best vampire fighter movie ever made.  I hope they make more blade movies like this one. Blade two was good, but this was the best one.
B000OZ0NXA|2.0|The book receives two stars, and not one, because of some degree of captivation, that made me read it through. But the book is incoherent, repetitive and poorly written. If I read the word 'shrugged' one more time, I'm going to yell unpleseant four letter words. The Jack Reacher carachter is interesting, but the author is not.
B00285K1KE|5.0|I liked how this movie gave the Hulk his roots. Both dads were bad guys. but the alpha female {hated her part}.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I thought this book was marvelous. A truly nicely told story of the first hand account of the killing of Osama bin laden
B008OM0EDO|4.0|Very humorous parody of stereotypical dictators.  Some dialogue may be really offensive - but let's not forget what and who we're watching.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is definitely the best book I have ever read. It touched my heart and taught me so many things. I couldn't put it down at night it was so great! I would recommend this book to everyone. I laughed, I cried, I loved it! Read this book, I guarantee you will love Wonder.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|One of the best bingo apps out there.  I love the daily tournament! I highly recommend this app, and you can't beat the price.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This works as advertised, which makes it very useful. However, there are times when it seems like I'm unable to control the volume w/ my phone, when the phone gets out of sync w/ the tv (so it doesn't show me the correct point at which I am in the video), and sometimes I am unable to turn the tv on w/ the phone.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|Funny and easy read over all.I enjoyed the main character and her mad sense of reality. Would recommend to a friend.
B006GWO5NE|3.0|The cable cord doesn't fit the PowerFast adapter tightly and I have to constantly push it in tight when plugging in my phone.
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|HUGE FUN!  Really nice game.  Runs well with interesting puzzle challenges.  This game definitely fills the void for Candy Crush Saga needs.  Unlimited turns is very nice, especially if you can't clear a board.  Fruit Drops II is on my daily game list.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pintrest!  I especially like it for recipes, I have found some really great ones and made them for my family.  It is very addicting!
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Adele's first album is stellar!  She has such a gift for story telling.  Her voice is so amazing and pure without any fancy sound effects and extras.  Very enjoyable, start to finish .
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham is the reason I started reading as an adult (I'd had enough in college)! This one is as good as the rest. It is set with the same characters and place as &#34;Time To Kill' so it felt like going home. But the plot was fresh and not predictable. Great read. I can never put his down.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|What can I say after reading the latest book by one of the most gifted writers of all time? Outstanding metaphors, great dialogue, descriptions that place you simultaneously, where the character are and in your own safe haven. Early criticisms that King couldn't write female characters seem ludicrous with this work. Abra is an endearing and believable young lady and I can't wait to meet her again. Thank you Stephen for giving back to us, Danny Torrence, in such a captivating way.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Excellent photography, tight script, no wasted scenes.  The transition into the Moneypenny/Bond relationship  and the modern Bond concept was excellent.
B0083Z614S|4.0|As a parent, reading about these sour children frustrated me but it was wonderful to read how the children fixed themselves despite the terrible indulgences of the adults.  It's a good lesson for us all to get fresh air and not let ourselves be pre-occupied with dark, negative thoughts.
B00000HZFP|5.0|i love this album. the movie versions of the songs are great, but nothing beats the original cast recordings. GREAT!
B00G9B1MEM|5.0|The graphics in this game are so realistic and fun.  The game is simple with fun little challenges and great creatures. Loving it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesome I have it and I play it all the time you should to it is better than the screen shots those are old ones.
B005S9EKCW|2.0|I'm amazed that this butchering of a classic has received as many positive reviews as it has.  While the supporting cast did an adequate job, and the visuals were pleasing, Hugh Jackman's awkward (often off key) performance made this a truly miserable auditory experience.
B00BV5FVR0|5.0|Not happy that kindle tells you the lines that other people have underlined...I like my experience of a book to be personal.  This series of books by Margaret Atwood are excellent...funny, a bit sad, thought provoking...and I am very sorry to have got to the end of the series.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This has beautiful graphics. The special effects are intense. This game runs smoothly. This is my first time playing this type of game. I've tried other similar ones but found them boring. This one makes me want to keep playing.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is very fun and entertaining I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to pass time or to just have fun
B00GH4R95C|4.0|different from original - still good - great special effects<br />great actors cast in the movie more story about home planet and parents
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I love this movie. I never see this movie before till I purchased it. very meaningful Japanese animation movie. I'm glad I owe it
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Magical & spell binding. Wonderful story that wraps around each character. Will look for more books by this author. And great for book clubs that like theme get togethers.
B00FMAZ49U|1.0|I purchased this because I couldn't find the Zagg HD Invisible Shield on Amazon Prime and this had good/decent reviews.<br /><br />Oh, what a crap this product is~!  :(  Installing this screen protector is frustrating and laborious as getting all the air bubbles out was impossible for me.  And, using the provided squeegee and microfiber cloth actually scratched up the screen protector really bad.<br /><br />What an epic fail of a product.  When it comes to this product, &#34;Made in Korea&#34; means nothing as it is no better than &#34;Made in China&#34; screen protectors.<br /><br />I'm gonna return this and just buy the Zagg product from its website.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so much fun. Once you start playing your hooked for hours. Or just until you run out of lives :-)
B008SVS3FC|5.0|The lyrics are very clever which is typical for John Hiatt.  Not really country and not really rock 'n roll, but he is a great musician and fun to listen to.  Took me listening to whole album about 3 times to really like it but now it's one of my favorites.  If you are a Hiatt fan, this is a good album.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, it kept me guessing to the very end of the book. Very well written and easy to read
0062107313|4.0|i am a big fan of Amy Tan's writing and i always learn little bit about humanity with its deep pain and the rise of the spirit, and Chinese culture.  The setting of this book is 1910's and into 1926: based on the main character, Violet and all her variations as her life changed from one form to another: always seeking to be loved and something she may not know she would be seeking.  I think this was a challenging/ambitious concept to get across in the book that towards the end, the details were pushed through little too fast or I didn't get the depth of betrayal that I thought might have been there.  If you love Amy Tan then you will read this book, but it is not one of her best in terms of getting my heart string pulled!  [it will probably make a great movie as there are so many angles and 'lives' that the main character had in the short span of her life!  I still had a great read and learnt a lot about women's life (for the not so rich class or if your life took a few bad turns and what they had to put up with) .. Amy Tan still delivered a great novel of immense detail about life in china and the courtesan world - very intriguing.
B008MEM24S|4.0|My daughter really enjoys this game. She has multiple versions of it and plays every single one just about equally
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|in this game its like your out there with the animals and its a great time consumer if its not hunting season outside its hunsting season on your tablet.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|A different way to look at the world through flowers.  The power of connections and love.  Not the pat answers we expect from books on love.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Best budget cooler out there. Cooler master seems to always find the sweetspot between money expended and performance of the product
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I loved this book!! When I first heard a description of this book, it intrigued me and it sounded like something I would like.<br /><br />In this alternate America love has been outlawed; actually treated as a disease. Amor Deliria Nervosa is the name of the condition and the treatment is to have brain surgery at age eighteen to eliminate the ability to love. The government believes love is the root of all evil and must be eradicated to have a stable, peaceful society.<br /><br />After the cure you are paired with another cured and are able to enter society as a stable adult.<br />(Much like the book the Giver)It's not just romantic love that is considered dangerous. A mother is forbidden to love her child, but only takes care of him because it is her duty. And you can't love friends either.<br /><br />&#60;spoiler&#62; Lena is the protagonist, a young seventeen year old girl looking forward to being cured until she meets Alex. Alex has pretended to be cured and has forged documentation and fake surgery scars so that no one suspects that he is from the Wilds. The Wilds are where the Invalids live: the uncured. They of course fall in love and must sneak around to avoid detection. Lena learns the many and various ways the government has lied to her. They told her that her mother, who was uncurable despite several attempts, had committed suicide. Actually they had imprisoned her in the Crypts and with Alex's help, she learns that her mother has escaped. At this point, Lena realizes she cannot go along with the program, and must leave everything behind to live with Alex in the Wild. Unfortunately she is found out before she can leave, and the couple must risk escape at the point of death. Alex shows how much he loves Lena and how selfless he is by giving himself up to save her&#60;spoiler&#62;<br /><br />This altered America has indoctrinated the masses by banning certain literature (poetry), teaching Romeo and Juliet as a cautionary tale, and so altering the bible that it no where resembles anything God-like. They use the names of the biblical heroes but they change the stories to fit their agenda. The psalms are different and they consider the Holy Trinity to be God, science and order. It is reminiscent of the worship service in Beneath the Planet of the Apes where they pervert the liturgy, changing it to Glory be to the bomb and the Holy Fallout.<br /><br />The ending is a cliff-hanger, which I happen to love, so of course I immediately downloaded Pandemonium to read. If it's half as good as the first book, I will not be disappointed.it no where resembles anything God-like. They use the names of the biblical heroes but they change the stories to fit their agenda.

B002PMV9FG|5.0|right on time and exactly as described and was a very affordable price and a very good movie I will enjoy for years
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Good Product, but needs more apps, in iOS just youtube and netflix, in windows supports google chrome, when chromecast let send streaming of photos, movies, to tv would be perfect.

B00GD9F59S|5.0|A great way to finish the series. Page turning plot twists until the very end! Thanks, Armentrout for this action and love packed read!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games provided such excitement!  The novel was spell bounding and kept the reader on the edge to uncover the next episode and surprise ENDING.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|This app is very useful for me. I use it to remind myself that I have a task that is ready in the MMO that I play. I can do the task once a day on each of my characters, so I have to wait 24 hours before I can do the task again.
B003G4W49C|5.0|ENDER'S GAME was so thought provoking.  I was enthralled with the pace and constant shift in the story. This novel is a leader's companion.
B000002JSP|5.0|I really get tired of Zep fans (and Led Zeppelin themselves!) dismissing this great album.  While Page and Bonham were literally wasting away in heroin and alcohol addictions respectively, John Paul Jones and Robert Plant united their creative juices to influence the direction of these recording sessions.  This was probably a transitional album for them, but Like Led Zeppelin III, it really demonstrates their ability to change directions without losing focus.    John Paul Jones was always the George Harrison of Led Zeppelin.  He was and always will be much more than 'No Quarter'.  Ripe with untapped talent, he took the reigns here and delivered some of their most interesting and listenable work.  'In The Evening' is probably the song that feels most like the album's predecessor 'Presence'.  It is really the only song on the album that is purely guitar-driven.  'South Bound Suarez' and 'Hot Dog' are probably the weakest songs on the album due mainly to some obviously sloppy guitar work by Page.  'Fool in the Rain' is a masterpiece though.  Jones' piano and Bonham's complex drum tempos are what drive this catchy song so well.  Despite Bonham being very near self destruction during these sessions, his drumming could never have been better than in this song.    Like 'In The Light' on Physical Graffiti, 'Carouselambra' is John Paul Jones delving into more new territory with his infusion of keyboards.  Plant's vocals are not recorded particularly well here, but the end result is at least pretty good.  What can you say about 'All My Love?'  No, it does not sound like anything Zeppelin has ever done.  Yet, it's a beautiful song with Plant's mournful lyrics (lamenting his son's death) and Jones' layered keyboard arrangements.  The classical guitar overdub in the bridge is a first for Page.  There are moments (although few) where Page really does shine.  Plant's vocals have never been better than in these last two songs. The final track \\"I'm Gonna Crawl\\" is a slow, somewhat bluesy ballad which does bring Plant and Page both back to the front and center.  Again, Plant's vocals are amazing.    'In Through The Out Door' will never be 'Whole Lotta Love' or 'Black Dog.'  But, It's their final studio album that should not be dismissed for what it is not.  Give them credit for trying something new.  Listen and you will hear a taste where Zeppelin was headed.
B00B19GKI0|1.0|Thought it sucked!  I was sorry I watched the whole movie it was so bad.  Not sure how it got 4 stars from anyone
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Does what it says it will and now even more services are coming online with it. I got in at the right time and had it early with one for each HDTV.
B0073RSVMC|5.0|This thing is awesome! It is very high quality - great attention to detail, solid and durable, great size, movable jaw, and overall just worth every penny.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is very addictive and lots of fun.  It is such a high when you complete a stop that you've been trying to solve for a long time.  Great pastime.
B00FXMGI0G|3.0|I loved the first Red.  Very good. Original. Great characters.<br />Red 2 has the same characters sans Morgan Freeman.<br />For the life of me, I cannot figure out why they decided to make Mary Louise Parker's character an absolute moron in this film. It took at least 1 if not 2 stars off of my rating.  The made her an incompetent imbecile.<br />The movie was otherwise great.  Malkovich is superb.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great action flick, Lawrence does a super job! Book was great and flick came very close. I recommend it to all.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Okay, when I first started this book I thought it would be ridiculous and silly. I admit it, I had low expectations for this book. I was wrong.<br />  A cyborg in China is a mechanic. Now, there are plenty of cyborgs in Bejing. But this cyborg is a sixteen year old girl with as many metal parts as flesh and blood. Her name is Cinder. When the Prince Kia comes to her little shop in the city plaza she's startled to find that he takes interest in her (though  nobody else is) she needs to fix his old robot from childhood that secretly holds information on lunars,a race of corrupted beings that want to take over earth. There is also  a plague racing through the city and with Kia's father during from it Kia has to take hold of the Lunar situation. The best option is marrying the Lunar queen, who is ruthless and a dictator. All lunars have a special power that makes them twisted and even manipulate each other. Cinder needs to get this information to Kia before it's too late and he sends the marriage proposal.<br /><br />  Now. For the reason I loved this book. It had interesting little details and the background picture was different then I thought it would. It's more like a bunch of different stories in the series. Cinder was resourceful and witty, but at the same time had some weaknesses almost every girl has, like kind of having a crush on Kai and being flustered around him, like when he comes to drop his android Its common to have a crush on celebrities, right?<br /> I almost gave this book a four so nobody thought this would be like those reviews that just say something like, oh this was amazing! Really good book! And be done with it. I hate when reviews don't have a thing on what the books about.<br /><br /> It also had the characters a little off on personalities. I would have thought Kia would not be the kind Prince he is. He should be at least a little selfish, to make the story seem more realistic.  He seems to be little too into cinder to me. At the same time, I'm fine with it, because appreciation for someone  a class below you can never hurt in stories like this.<br /><br />  It should've had more of a back story or more scenes with Cinder's stepsister and their relationship. other wise, it was great and held my attention.
B009R659L8|4.0|Love Mary Higgins Clark.  I have read all of her books, and am amazed at her talent. This nook will not disappoint.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been playing Candy Crush on my iPhone and now that I've downloaded to my Kindle it's even more fun to see the puzzle in a larger format. The only things is I had to start from the beginning again and after doing the puzzle in Level 40 on my iPhone, it was almost funny how easy the first levels are. And yes, I'm addicted!!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It is GREAT I love Despicable Me is my fab. Movie I love the game it makes me think of the movie
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|great app on kindle fire! I play on my I-phone and then go to my kindle fire and play with full lives. The only problem is I spend way too much time playing this awesome game. Thank you Amazon and King!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The Kids Love This Game They say It's The Best Game Ever!!!<br />I Recommend this Game to almost anyone!!!<br />They Love It
1476727651|3.0|Good (not great) sequel to The Shining. As King says in a brief afterword, The Shining is one of his most-revered works and it would be tough to live up to it. He's right, but he doesn't disappoint either. Little Danny Torrance is now a grown-up Dan Torrance, recovering from his own bout with alcoholism (similar to his own father, Jack Torrance). King doesn't rush things here (or lay on too much set-up); as the book opens we revisit Danny and Wendy a few years after the events of The Shining took place and then we get to see an adult Dan at his lowest before he begins the long road of recovery. The character of Dan is fully realized, as is Abra Stone, a new heroine and teenage girl who befriends Dan through their mutual telepathic skills. There's also a new group of bad guys called the True Knot who function like a band of travelling vampires seeking out kids with the Shining and killing them for their lifesource (which keeps the band going). All of this stays interesting and makes for a page-turning good time, but overall the story often lacks the depth and emotional resonance of earlier King books (such as The Shining). Still, I enjoyed this book and never felt let down by the revelations of Dan's life after the Overlook.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I am on to book 3.  I am so tempted to read on past what season 3 left us with in the HBO  series as I read BOOK 3.  These books are awesome.
B002Q9MZF6|5.0|Beautifully filmed, good singers, just perfect.<br />I habe seen many differnt versions, this is by far the best.<br />Can only recommend to buy this version.
0061122416|5.0|An adventure into the fantasy of other lands and others times.  Couldn't put it down and I'M DETERMINED TO RE-READ IT AGAIN SOON.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|So well written I was drawn in immediately; I felt like I was part of the team, rooting and cheering for them to victory.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game for people of all ages.<br />My kids love it and I like playing it too. We compete to see who can get the better scores.. and they usually win!
B0027MJU00|5.0|Read Gone Girl first and had to read another! Lived up to my expectations. May have liked it more than Gone Girl. Great story writer. The characters are easy to follow and complex. Keeps you on the edge wanting to know more
B00C5R7B0I|1.0|I've read other Scarpetta novels, and I'm glad I read them first or I probably would never have read a second one. This one started slow and didn't pick up much after that. Just boring.
B0053TMP24|4.0|I love Percy Jackson. I love that the Amozon company is ran by the Amazons!!! Dakota is hilarious with his red kool-aid addiction. Octavian is weirdly interesting, and Nico is as hot as ever. I have a crush on him. :)<br />Kinda hard to follow, though, especially for people who are just a little ADD!=)
B00ECL7ZJ2|5.0|The album is nothing ground breaking but nonetheless fantastic. Coming from three sisters who have a huge amount of soul and potential, writing excellent pop/modern rock songs to broken beats and grungy guitar riffs. With HAIM you get a nice mix of classic LA rock influence with a modern edge that sparks your interest. Eagerly awaiting their next effort.
B008JFUPZI|5.0|Jeff bridges was hilarious and his interactions Mary Louise Parker are classic. All Star cast! Highly recommend. Digital version was a cool addition.
B001HN694K|5.0|Just a Great movie.  Enjoyed watching it very much.  Great acting and costumes.  Movie kept your interest the whole way through.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Riveting. In the ilk of Bourne, Rapp and Bond. Only a tad more enthralling.<br /><br />Can't wait for the next Will Robie story.
B00B5HQL50|4.0|Thought Skyfall was an exciting movie.  Still had some of the old James Bond tricks but for the most part was a new James Bond with hard hitting action and a good story line.
B0017SWSCW|5.0|The development of the characters is so profound that one finds themselves looking around crowded rooms and upscale eateries ,wondering what real life drama is lurking just beyond our knowledge. Well done Ol' Chap.
B00G4U7TO0|5.0|LOVE IT! Great music to relax to. This album is a great gateway to folk music if you're curious but unfamiliar where to start. Always bet on T-Bone Burnett. :)
B00377V6J2|5.0|This is HISTORY! with this guys is a perfect CD/DVD COLLECTION! If you love BLUES this is the BEST! Albert King and Stevie are extraordinary guitar players!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|All I wanted and expected from this little gizmo was a way to access Netflix on my bedroom TV.  That is exactly what I got!  My only negative comment is that I had to wrap the dongle in electrical tape because the little bright white light emanating from it lit up the bedroom once the lights and TV were turned off.  Simple fix.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Beautiful book. Loved learning the meaning of flowers and enjoyed how the author wove them into the story. Great story.
B00A6C3JN2|5.0|This is a powerful, easy to use microcontroller board.  It is currently running a research project for my electrical engineering degree.  Good stuff.
B00BF11UM0|5.0|We got em.  Osama that is.  After reading mark Owens book, no easy day, this movie is a must watch.  Very close to the book and give details into what it took to get that mad man.  That girl deserves the highest honor and pay in this country.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|It is the kind of music that I would love to hear most of the time, beautiful voice and beautiful sounds, very refreshing to my ears.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This book cost me many hours of sleep.  I couldn't put it down. Grisham was at his finest with many twists and turns.
B00E0SX118|5.0|Great movie! We went to it in the theater and rented it as soon as it came out.  Kids, us and the grandparents LOVED it!  We'll probably end up buying this one!
B00G6ZTM3Y|1.0|When I go to create a character and get to the name page, there is no keyboard and no way to move past with a default or random name. This makes the app completely unplayable.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game.It really makes you use your skills and your mind. I have had fun playing this game.
1609611543|4.0|Need to read at this point.  Other projects came before it in the scheme of things.  I also heard the author on the radio.
B005U9QJY2|5.0|What an old movie my sister spent forever trying to remember it and the name she watched the movie when she was a kid and shes 17 now how did she remember it SO OLD BUT LOVED THE CREEPY CREATURES
B0039TD7PY|5.0|I would have liked a tracking number on the item, but it wasn't provided by the seller.  The CD and DVD are just as good as I had anticipated they would be.
0763644765|5.0|My baby loves to read this book.  I got it when she was around 12 months and we were starting to EC.  Six months later, this book is still in heavy rotation and our little toddler is making great progress with her toilet learning.  My favorite thing about this book is that it doesn't introduce any neuroses: no &#34;I'm afraid of the toilet!&#34; or &#34;I don't know how to use the potty!&#34; nor is there a subtext of shame around natural body functions.  This book is perfect.  Reassuring and informative, humorous and encouraging.  LOVE!
B004HY9NKI|5.0|Machete is a great Danny Trejo Movie!  Lots of ridiculous gore and blood and lots of crazy action!  If you like ridiculous violence, blood, and action then you should definitely check this movie out!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was weary of reading this at first due to all the graphic sex but I promise you THERE IS A GREAT STORY! Especially here in the third book. I'm so sad that it's over! I would gladly welcome another book!
B003VANOFY|5.0|I purchased this to replace a Plantronics unit that had failed three times in a year.  I had sent the Plantronics unit back twice, paying for shipping both times.  After it broke a third time I trashed it and bought this unit.  After about a year this unit has held up really well, continues to charge fully and is a sturdy, reliable headset.  I will look to Logitech in the future as they appear to make high quality, durable electronics at reasonable prices.
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|Refreshing to watch a movie wit no swearing and that I don't have to fast forward all the time.  Thanks for a great entertaining movie.  Also love the Village...
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Unless you need a name-brand camera bag, I can't see any reason to spend more than the $28 I spent for this on a lightning deal.  You can create and remove compartments as needed.  You can also keep all the camera stuff in one spot...including other secondary cameras and associated accessories.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|I install wolfram alpha on any of my tablets, phones or comps. Its so good. Higly recomended. And in kindle i have this for free. I used coins :)
B00425S1H8|5.0|Works better than expected.  Seems like most of these type a converters only work about 80% to 90% of what I consider perfect.  I thought I'd try this to program my NASCAR scanner rather than firing up my old (and slow) Pentium IV in order to connect to the DB-9 serial port.  It works great and is a trouble-free adapter.
031624662X|4.0|A good book, the authour did a very good job in describing how a all powerful A.I. could think and react, and how different human civilization could be so alien, if only on a sociological and philosophical standpoint.<br /><br />I recommend it to anyone that want to get an entertaining lecture and be brought in truely foreign worlds.
B00177E1Z0|5.0|This is the classic sound track to a classic movie.  If you can get it on one of Amazon's $5.00 deals, even better.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This was an excellent book. Couldn't put it down once I started it. Also liked it because the characters were familiar from A Time to Kill. Loved it.
B00CP4RZIO|5.0|Despite being plagued by line up changes through out the years, Chimaira has managed to deliver hardcore metal and superior guitar shredding to the masses! I have been a dedicated fan since I discovered them just last year, I've have all their albums from &#34;This Present Darkness&#34; to present and can honestly say that I love every single song....I don't know how many people can say that about their favorite band or any band in general. It's hard for me to choose a favorite album, This is a great album but in all honesty I still love their previous albums much more. I absolutely love the track &#34;Wrapped in Violence&#34; and other tracks that stand out are &#34;Plastic Wonderland&#34; ... &#34;No Mercy&#34; ... and &#34;Kings of the Shadow world&#34;. The album artwork is also great! Chimaira is here to stay and this album certainly makes that clear!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great game, but the commercials before every hand is annoying, but you can skip them, thank goodness, or I would not play this game

0812550706|1.0|Had incredible potential and beautiful story-lines but ultimately it was ruined. Ender was clever buy by no means did the author sell that he was a genius. His &#34;innovative&#34; strategies were also unrealistic in that he was the first to think of them. His age was unrealistic with mental development even for child geniuses. Having him save humans by destroying the aliens, then save the aliens, then write a &#34;bible,&#34; and having his brother become leader of Earth was too much. You may as well just say &#34;Ender found out that the game was real and he saved humans by killing all the aliens. Oh and then he became god. All at the young age of 2.&#34;<br /><br />Had great potential, but in the end he made too many unrealistic stretches even for a sci fi. The strength of REAL classics like HP, SW, LOTR, etc... are that each hero has a legit weakness and needs to rely on others for strength beyond his own. Luke Skywalker's faith in his father and friends. Frodo's determination and friendship with Sam. Harry Potter's ethics and friends. I threw this book against a wall when I finished because I was so mad because imagine you finish reading harry potter and it goes a little something like this<br /><br />&#34;And Harry defeats Voldemort, creates an elixir that makes him immortal, writes the new charter for Hogwarts, becomes minister of magic...then king of the magical world and reforms it, and added to the pantheon of gods worshiped by house elves. Oh and he did it all without even knowing it because he's just that good. The end.&#34;<br /><br />Terrible.
B0073COMUW|3.0|Not a great LED bulb. It looks grey-ish and none natural. There are newer LED bulbs that are far better.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Another one in the Lord of the Rings genre.  I love the fantasy of it all.  Keep them coming.  Fun trolls!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This novel is insightful, sad, and at times funny. It gives you all the first love moments we all can relate to, but in a whole new light as these teens deal with surviving day to day. It tackles the thought of leaving a legacy when you are young and dying. Simply put its brilliant and a must read .
B00005JKZV|5.0|Can't go wrong with this.  I think my favorite is the first in series, but, nonetheless, I still liked this one.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|I am decided to watch this show. This series doesn't even compare to season one but it is still great. Jessica Lange, as usual, gives a stunning performance. I love the fact that they are using some of the same actors from season one in totally new roles and there is no trace of there former roles. I didn't even realize that they had reused tate from season one in this season for at least a few shows.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|Excellent buy...this was for my sister and he is in love with it. The product arrived on time and in perfect conditions.
B002H6ZQRM|5.0|One of my favorite movies ever. I love how the drunks and the zombies are so similar in the beginning. Worth watching more than once because there are a lot of funny things that happen that you don't really catch on to until re-watching it.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Loved the style, it held my attention from the first page. I have been in technology for 30 years and learned more about the business from this book and Isaacson's insights than living it myself.
B005D63ICI|5.0|I love Dexter. I have to admit the first two seasons where my favorite but still conceptually I think this is one of the best shows out there. I like the moral dilemma of whether or not it is ok to like Dexter or his actions. I also like the creative film work. The intro to the show is beautiful and disgusting at the same time. There are day to day mundane tasks like tying shoes and cutting fruit that the film makers manage to turn into an image of something far more sinister.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Excellent read and a great mix of history and fantasy. I love the use of photographs throughout the novel. It will leave you wanting more. I would recommend this for teens and young adults.
B0055D3EOG|3.0|creepy for a while then insidious becomes ridiculous and it becomes rather funny. I don't think that is what they were going for but I have a twisted sense of humor and couldn't help but laugh at some of the goings on towards the end.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|It's pretty good but it's obviously a starter movie for Will's son.  The story is OK and the plot is OK but not epic or anything.  I think they both do a good job.
0321525655|4.0|The book is awesome and useful. I bought it to get some advice on how to create and deliver effective presentations for a project I am developing (to present it to eventual partners)
B009RX85N0|5.0|I absolutely love Once Upon A Time, and I was so happy to get my hands on this. It was a great price, and it's definitely worth your cash!
1616550414|5.0|Cool as, heaps of awesome illustrations, beautiful book, highly recommend, great gift for nerds. Why don't you just buy it
B00B1RB942|5.0|Admittedly the purchase of this movie was based on a whim, however after watching this movie I am glad I made this purchase.  The story line of the movie is wonderful, creative and endearing.  A must have for individuals both new to anime and long time anime lovers.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|The most amazing G5 game EVER! If you pay the $4.99 you have one of the best games you will ever play! Personally, I think this is the best app ever!
B005NQ94KS|1.0|This movie is the worst movie I have ever seen and that is not an exaggeration.  When talking about horrible movies around the water cooler, this movie ALWAYS comes up.  I usually don't mind romantic comedies once in awhile and my wife loves them, but she actually apologized for making us watch this movie as we were walking out of the theater a few years ago.  I'm not going to spoil the movie, but if you are looking for a comedy or a romantic movie please look elsewhere.  Just as I started to think, well maybe its not so bad...  Bam!  What a depressing movie.
B009T1IZ44|5.0|This is a very funny and good written book. Jeff Kinney is my favourite author so far. You are a AMAZING writer
B00AU15HPC|5.0|I have followed the Moody Blues for 50 years and never been disappointed in their music or the lyrics. Most of them written by Justin Hayward . These albums are just a progression of what was and what is to come. His take on some of rocks classics are all great and at the same time a simple songwriter and a musician at his best and what he was meant to do. He once said in an interview he wrote songs for the head and heart and that sums it up !
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|No need to comment. It is a very addicting game to play. It also very fun.<br />It has a lot  of weapons at your disposal. Amazing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|cool snakes and the furious at least he's not a great day of history master chief vs vs Justin Justin never had a great day of history master chief vs Justin never had a a a great day of history master chief of the family in him my mom moved out the kit and i have been there for is the best of history
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a really fun app to play when I have nothing else to do. It also wakes up my mind because you have to use strategy. A really great app from beginning to end.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Despicable me Minion Rush I the BEST GAME EVER!! At first I thought that it would be Temple Run, but with the minions. I sure was wrong. You can unlock so many different worlds for your minion. There's Gru's Lab, The Residental Area, El Macho's Lair (despicable me 2), The Mall (also despicable me 2), and Minion Beach (despicable me 2). People who haven't seen Despicable Me 2 should go see it. This game will be much better if you do. Tip: Whenever you unlock a new world, don't pay tokens to get there. You can get anywhere from any stage, as long as you've unlocked the place where you want to go. Hope this review helps make you decision about this wonderful game!
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|I love Breaking Bad. Without equal, in my opinion. Absolutely the best television show I've ever seen. And I will continue to rewatch the episodes for years to come. However, what the hell do I want with a novelty barrel and a goofy plastic apron? Is THIS why the box set lists for $300? I just want the DVDs (or BluRays), with all the video extras, including the new documentary, in NORMAL cases or a heavy-duty slipcase, that I can stack on my shelf with everything else. I'm hopeful that Sony will issue a stripped-down version of the set in the near future without all the silly non-video nonsense included to pad the price. Remember that old proverb: The Customer Is Always Right. Some of us want a no-frills box set. And so I'll wait. Obviously, I give 5***** for the show; no stars for this box set.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Great game keeps you on your toes and have you playing for days trying to get past your family and friends I just love the game
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|This is an amazing album. I love almost every song on here :) With every album she releases, Lady Gaga proves she is not a one-trick pony!

B0063GORYU|5.0|I really enjoy this free app. Thanks. It keeps my brain working! I pick up my Kindle when I have a few minutes and play a game.
B003Q97D48|5.0|Awesome TV show! The concept first didn't appeal to me, but after the urging of my friends I started watching it and actually really liked it! Highly recommended. It's addictive! My favorite character is either Hanna or Aria.
B00G32QIEG|3.0|Kind of reminded me about the Ghostbuster movie from the 80s. Has some few funny moments and Jeff Bridges is always good to watch although they did make it difficult to understand what he was mumbling.....
B00G722T22|5.0|Great album! Avril Lavigne doesn't dissapoint. My favorites are Here's To Never Growing Up, Rock And Roll, Give You What You Like, Sipping on Sunshine, and Bad Girl. :) Let me go is also good, overall I recommend this album!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|More smooth and a lot more fun. Has more stuff than the original one. There is a seaport, an tower where you can search for treasure and more. And it is free!!!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book helps me spell and understand words that are confusing. It helps me use bigger words when speaking.<br />Thank you Oxford dictionary!!!
B00G91Z8AQ|5.0|This was by far the best showing of what happens when<br />Superpowers beings'  go at it. For that alone I loved it,<br />Add in the great cast and awesome way they did the back story, makes it awesome.<br />Long live the house of EL.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I rated this book because it was helping me on homework and other important things. I would say that is helpful! Well not all the time, but some times. It also helps me with my spelling words for school.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I haven't played it yet but it looks pretty fun.I would suggest it just by the reviews and pictures.I I I I I I I i
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was a more subtle version of &#34;War of the Roses&#34; and certainly keeps you guessing about what is going to happen.  Sort of disappointing in the end that there was no swinging from the chandeliers but still a very good book.  As the others say, sexual language and foul language are not a huge part of the book, but still there.
B005NFVZTM|2.0|I wanted to like this movie.  I though the concept was great.  The execution, though, pitiful.  The whole move felt clumsy and ill-conceived.  Xavier and Magneto were capable actors but given little to do.  No one else in the movie had any talent at all.  The casting was the worst imaginable.<br /><br />Kevin Bacon is capable actor... just not here.  Shaw was physically imposing in the comics; an barely constrained monster.  Bacon is skinny, sadly old and completely lost in camp.  January Jones doesn't have the gravitas to play the White Queen.  And the choices for the other characters were just sad.  Banshee as a kid, Darwin (!), Pixie as a ho...  The only inspired choice was Hank McCoy, cast again against type.  And when he became PowerPuff Boy... er, &#34;Beast&#34;... underwhelming.  Say what you want about Kelsey Grahmer as Beast in the earlier movie, he looked and sounded perfect.<br /><br />Ultimately, though, casting is not the chief flaw of this movie.  Uninspired &#34;training&#34; (let's train Beast by having him run around the mansion) and Banshee melting manikins.  Training is always a dangerous choice; here it's just boring.  Sending these feeble character to end the Cuban Missile Crisis?  How did the world not end?<br /><br />Bryan Singer has shown himself to have no emotional range.  Every movie he directs is a disappointment.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|I read this book and kept seeing it as a wonderful entertaining romantic comedy.  Or as they used to call it a<br />&#34;Screwball Comedy&#34;. Loved the characters, the warmth, the interesting plot and the heart.  You cheer for these characters and when the book was over I felt like giving it a standing ovation.  A must read.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|The headphones are comfortable and fold up to fit nicely in a small pocket of my backpack.  I sometimes get static when I move around with the headphones on.  This may be caused by the headphone plug rotating slightly in the jack of the iPad.  It's hard to tell.  The length of the cord is just right.  The amount of coiled cord and straight cord seems to work well for me.  I use them quite a bit in a Barnes & Noble cafe which can get noisy at times.  Since these are an over the ear design, they isolate me just enough to let me concentrate on the videos I am watching.  I can still hear some ambient sound but these are not meant to be noise cancelling or for total isolation of sound.  Overall, they seem very rugged and well worth the price.
B00B5HQLMI|1.0|To be gratuitously violent and occasionally salacious is a mark of all the Bond films,  The others, however, compensate for this to some extent with occasional signs of intelligence and humor.  Skyfall, alas, has neither.  Judi Dench, who is a great actress, performs throughout as if well aware of the travesty of which she is part.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great book...a real page turner. If you can not handle the realities of war then take a pass. Chris tells it like you were right there along side him. Riveting book!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Finished in less than a day! I really liked it. Some parts I knew were coming but I love the love triangle cause I really can't figure out who will end up together. Great book.
B00G9W7NEO|5.0|This is a terrific movie, but not because of the &#34;stars.&#34; Hugh Grant  holds up his end fairly well  and Julia Roberts does an adequate job. But the real heart of the film is that it's simply loaded with a superb ensemble cast and sharp writing. Rhys Ifans is justifiably praised, but  look at the rest of this superb cast - Hugh Bonneville, Gina McKee, Emma Chambers, James Dreyfus and even a brief walk on by Emily Mortimer as &#34;perfect girl.&#34; Each character turns in a sterling performance that transforms an otherwise ho-hum affair between Grant and Roberts into a 5 star, capital M, Movie that's worth watching and re-watching. Rom-coms, from Pride and Prejudice onward, have to have a great supporting cast to overcome the limits of boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl.  And this movie has that kind of cast in spades and the writers know it. In fact, it would be easy to  make the case that the supporting cast IS the movie and that  Grant and Roberts are just the necessary fixtures to get things going.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game! I am so addicted to it that I even have to play it right before I go to bed. If I wake up in the middle of the night I play it too. Thank you for finally being able to play it on my kindle!!!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|addicting and fun but it freezes and it is hard to get acorns unless you buy them other than that its a good game
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|&#34;Sycamore Row&#34; is at the top of my favorite Grisham novels, started reading it yesterday and finished today.  Definitely his best, next to &#34;A Painted House&#34; it is my favorite
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Not one of grishams better books. Seemed like just a way to use the popular characters again. Nothing too new or exciting.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Either peoples minds have been opened or they have not. This book resonates with my relationship with God. The book I believe is mostly for those in the medical field to give them some background as to how it applies to their words. I enjoyed the technical aspect in hopes it allows more people to understand how much we are loved.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome game really fun the minions are so funny and cute rock on minion dudes and enjoy this awesome game purple pig
B008JFUPFI|5.0|one of the best Superman movies i have seen. Amy Adams gets Lois Lane,s character down better than anyone before her-she flat out nailed it,and Henry Cavill was also at the peak of the superman character. they also had a great chemistry together i was surprised to see Russel Crowe in it, but he was a good addition to the father on Krypton. there is such a great cast and the director actually used them well. a ton of action almost too much as you are actually tired when the movie is over. but it is great special effects, and non stop for a lot of the movie. as you can tell i really liked this movie, but this goes on me, so when you see the movie let me know what you thought. if i was off base i am sorry but i do think if you like these types of movies you will like this one, i am going to watch it again as i missed so much not knowing where it was going, as they changed the formula around a bit. Enjoy, i think you will
B009NF54ZE|3.0|It's a fun little game.  Quick easy and enjoyable.  Worth a try.  Not much  else to say about it.  Thanks
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|there is a real chemistry with Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves. i know that sounds unusual based on the two and the movies they have made, but it works. Yes, it is far fetched, but the story works, and it is a movie. if i want real life all i have to do is wake up in the morning. i get my &#34;fix&#34; for getting away from life in the movies, music, and the arts. beats the heck out of drugs, or other types. we all have to escape somehow, and this movie is a great help. it does keep one interested, at least i think so. you do understand that this is only my opinion, i wish i were more professional i n how i could dissect the movies, i only know what works for me, and that might not work for you, or whoever. it is different, but interesting, and on a fantasy level works for the media. just sit and enjoy, and bash it, or not, later.
B001EBV0NU|5.0|The best Tim Burton flick. Ever, Based on a set of bubble gum cards, so quite the literary master work.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Play it on my computer, my phone and my kindle...this is a love hate relationship.  For me it is a challenge and that's what I need
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|I got this game for my kids but I like playing it. Actually I play it more than they do.
B00CL151G4|5.0|This is simply the best show on television today.  While Holmes and Watson are perhaps not what Sir Conan Doyle had in mind, they are true to his intent for their characters.  Each show makes me feel as if I am reading an original Sherlock Holmes story with the added bonus of watching the relationship between Holmes and Watson grow and develop! Gripping and fun, this show is not mindless fluff - it is a &#34;thinking&#34; persons show!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Good book if you like the &#34;end of days&#34; type of story. It is sometimes confusing because there isn't really a time line of events. It is a group of different vignettes telling the story of a person or persons in there time and location. The good part is that you get to see how different people around the world deal with this type of apocalyptic event.
B008JFUS5A|5.0|A great follow up of the first movie. I only read the first book and DID NOT read the second, and I really enjoyed it, The movie was about half dialogues and half actions. I REALLY THINK THAT YOU WOULD ENJOY IT A LOT MORE IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|candy crush is the best,  I cannot stop playing!! so glad it is now on kindle to feed into my addiction
B009NF54ZE|4.0|The cool graphics &amp; fun object of the game kept us entertained for a while. We're thinking about getting the first version of the game along with this one.
B00E3VTR1K|5.0|Luca Rossi has a unique writing style that draws the reader into the insane, upside down world his characters are forced to endure by their tormentors. The predicaments his characters are thrown into, by no fault of their own, and the ways they evolve from them are humorous and touching. His science fiction tales are a delight.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|great time killer inbetween football games.<br />challenging. yet not too hard. the whole family loves it. turned me on to hunting games on console.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Simple game concept, but it's easy to lose track of time playing. It doesn't scale for the 7&amp;#34; tablet. I recommend this to anyone with the 9&amp;#34; tablet and those who remember offtowering in warcraft2.
B001DCZ4IW|3.0|They couldn't get anyone besides Cat Stevens to add some music to this watered down oldsters comedy?<br /><br />I liked Cat Stevens as much as anyone in the 70's. But, comeon. EVERY song in the movie?  Ruth Gordon, as a hip old lady, is humorous. Not hilarious,...just humorous.<br /><br />This movie is worth the 5 bucks Amazon is asking. Not much more than 5 bucks worth though.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just finished it and I'm already buying the next book. The professional narration was key to me finishing it so quickly.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME!!! This is an uno classic with a twist. It's fun and you would not want to put it down. The only con is that as with other games you have to pay for coins or wait to scratch for it. Other than that it's a great game.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Stephen Chbosky's thin epistolary coming-of-age novel has been rising in popularity ever since its initial publication nearly 15 years ago, enough to warrant a high-profile movie adaptation. Hearing great things about both, I decided to finally start with the novel. Being that the page count is pretty minimal, it took me just a couple of weeks to get through it.<br /><br />Some of you might be wondering, \\"Why a couple of weeks? Why not days? It's not like it's a complex read.\\" This is true. However, I soon found that Charlie's characterization and odd writing style proved to be somewhat off-putting. I was very surprised by this, given that I was very much a wallflower myself back in high school -- I thought that Chbosky's book would be tailor-made for people like me.<br /><br />Yet I found it hard to relate to Charlie. His letters (which he admits sound very similar to how he talks in real life) cause him to come across as alien or robotic, not at all like a normal person. I guess that this is the point given how inverted Charlie is, and maybe I might have been more accepting of this if Charlie had turned out to be diagnosed with Asperger syndrome or something, but as it stands, it made it hard for me to get close to Charlie as a narrator.<br /><br />Because of Charlie's peculiar personality, I also found it to be a stretch that Sam would develop into the inevitable and eventually reciprocating love interest for Charlie. (This is probably not giving anything away as it's pretty obvious what Sam's role will be as soon as she's introduced in the story.) I figured that because of Charlie's sweet nature, Sam would enjoy him as a friend in real life, but it seemed implausible for her to be truly drawn to him as a boyfriend. I mean, this kid cries more than any fictional protagonist I can think of, even when he retaliates against a school bully for beating him up (because he feels bad for doing it). It seemed more like this happens because it makes for a good plot.<br /><br />Which leads me to my last complaint about \\"Perks\\": the plot itself, for the most part, is pretty rote if you've read any number of entries in the coming-of-age novel genre. Charlie meets new people, has experiences both wonderful and harrowing, begins to blossom socially, goes through the natural ups-and-downs of high school romantic relationships, and ends up having the Best Year of His Life (TM). Save for a major revelation at the end, if you've read any books or watched any movies with a similar plot, you've been here before.<br /><br />So why give the book a 4-star rating? All kvetching aside, \\"Perks\\" is a fun read. Even though Charlie's writing is hard to reconcile with at times, it also makes the book stand out from the pack when it comes to style. I've never met anyone like Charlie, and he's a fascinating character study. The simplicity and directness of his prose makes haunting things come across as even more powerful, including his memory of watching a date rape and his darker descriptions of Aunt Helen. Chbosky's choice to render Charlie's observations in stark language makes it all the more hard-hitting when bad things do happen.<br /><br />So I'm glad to have read \\"Perks,\\" but because of a few quibbles, it's not going down as the next \\"Catcher in the Rye.\\" Maybe I'll fare better with John Green's \\"Looking for Alaska...\\"
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved the characterization, plot, and the ending.  This book stands on its own and the original story is not compromised.  King remains the master storyteller!
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|good family movie. nothing vulgar in it which is a massive plus. good for all familly members to watch. good adventure movie.
0316322407|5.0|I ordered this book after seeing Malala on &#34;The Daily Show&#34; and being so impressed by her courage and her wonderful attitude towards what had happened to her.  The book is very interesting and, admittedly, I knew far too little about the Swat Valley where she lived and about the politics in Pakistan at the time.  The way the book is written reflects who she is and by the time you get to the end, you will feel yourself much more knowledgeable about her life and about the hardships people have had to endure for things we in the U.S. take for granted.
B00B5HQLMI|2.0|Very Dull. Really only deserved a half star, but out of respect for the franchise I gave this snore-fest two stars
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|It is a very good game! See it for your self just like I did. hope it help you out
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is a great app if you want minecraft simple and to go whever you are with your device.  Can be a bit buggy, but hardly noticible. Note that the versions are updated every so often, and the developers add new stuff and fix bugs.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Very good but sad with the manipulation of the children. Curious to possibly read the next book to see if it continues.
B00E3IZIM0|4.0|Movie is pure entertainment.  The 3d is done superbly and the HD sound track is second to none.  This is my new showcase piece.
B0062NAX1U|3.0|i chose this movie for its Christian content, it has touching moments but its a little too formulated for my taste, the acting is alright.
B00EVW04PE|3.0|Was a bit boring. I would not recommend this to friends.<br /><br />Nothing more to say about this movie.... watch when no other options
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I really like it.  If I caould watch Amazon streaming movies on it,I'd like it even better,  It was easy enough to set up and use, but I'd like to be able to watch something besides Youtube with it.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|Good one & even though I forgot the story a but now, know that this can be watched again as it is value for the bucks
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun and exciting card game my friends and I love it alot we play it all the time its very fun and exciting to play
B00ECU2SGS|3.0|Was a bit dragging and also my spouse did not enjoy it.<br />Story was slow and did not like it overall
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I, of course, had my own personal experiences with how bias and gender roles play out in the workplace. I was resigned to play into the existing paradigm, even when I started working for myself. I was a work – at – home mommy, I felt I had a challenge in overcoming perceptions about dependability. I am a social media strategist, but my choice in lifestyle leaves me with not as much time as my competition to engage in social media. I have definitely had feelings of guilt and inferiority around how much I am supposed to be &#34;networking,&#34; both online and off-line.  The stories and data In this book have given me greater reason to feel confident about my choice, and to be unapologetic about it. It inspired me to be a more vocal advocate of equality in the workplace, and made me realize that I'm in a greater position to advocate than previously thought as a career coach.
B003G4W49C|4.0|In a sci-fi universe in which humanity is threatened to the brink of extinction from an unknown alien race, Ender faces many trials and tribulations during his pursuit of knowledge and self righteousness among his peers. However, there is more than meets the eye as you read through and experience the vivid world Orson Scott has created while unraveling the secrets that could change everything. (Hope to not spoil the story, but this is pretty much a generalization of what's to come.)<br /><br />The story will keep you interested until the very end. As there's lots of twists and turns that influences the story, whether it be small or large, it plays a part in the overall flow of the story.<br /><br />Definitely would be recommending it to casual readers who are hungry for some sci-fi action, as well as to the avid readers who are looking for something interesting to read.
B002ELIXCA|5.0|Well written, always entertaining. What more can I say....the cast is engaging, well acted, I love being able to purchase series for my video libray to access whenever I want, at my convenience!

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It was easy to set up, and works well with our Netflix account. We can start  a tv show or movie on my iPhone or iPad and easily switch to our flat screen.<br /><br />The only function that I wish it had is the ability to broadcast from my TV apps.
0689835604|4.0|Purchased this for our baby, he's now 8 months old.  He loves the pictures and is happy to help me turn the pages.  He gets a kick out of the flip up flaps but I have to be sure to take the book away from him when I'm not reading it to him because he has started to try to tear and eat the flip up pages.  For the danger of the tearing and eating pieces of the flaps, I gave it 4 stars.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved it. Very great book and story line. I loved how it ended.I would love for there to be another book.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|this is a great horror movie it should be watched by anyone who enjoys a good scare so have fun
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|I love this movie..it is focused on what can and does happen in families everyday.  It's a comedy, drama, inspiring and uplifting movie that can be watched over and over. I have watched it on movie channels dozens of times and it was one I definitely had to buy!
B00GFOIUVQ|4.0|as far as tap games go this is in my top 3 fun for my kids and still enjoyable for me
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's amazing! It's fun and addictive! Your dodging and constantly running. The playing itself isn't the best part. Customising my  characters and board is the best!! A must get!!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is great though it took me almost 30 minutes to get it the beaver is evil I tried it. And it attacked me!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Great app for keeping up with the weather. It could use more details on local weather conditions. Other than that, it is a great little app.
B000HKYA1I|1.0|very dull and boring, couldn't even get past the first 30 minutes, this was a complete waste of my money
B008M721MS|5.0|Awesome way to keep in touch and works great! I was amazed at how well it works on my Kindle Fire.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I really like this game. The only thing I could do without are the ads between each game but at least they let you skip them quickly. I've gotten used to it.
B00GLX0Z8C|4.0|We ordered this in HD.  The picture was not even clear.  It was a good movie, but the quality was awful.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|More fun than a bug zapper on a hot summer night.<br />As much fun as tickling your wife until she pee`s her pants.
B00DJYJPLO|4.0|It was a good third edition.  Followed the first two in the series very well.  Look forward to the next &#34;Before&#34; movie in eight years.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I really like this game. I like the graphics and the story line and you get to do a lot of different things in this game. The only reason why I gave it four stars is because it costs money for extra coins and crowns. Unless you feel like waiting 8 hrs for two hero's to find a little bit of experience and like one or two items. I think that if it is labeled a free game then it should be a free game all around.
B000SEH80I|5.0|I read this book many years ago at a time when I “needed” to read it.  Essentially, after reading the book, I realized that it was okay for me to enter therapy and deal with what had to be addressed.  To say that this book was a lifesaver is not really an exaggeration.<br /><br />Recently, a friend of mine shared some “stuff” that she was facing for the first time regarding her father.  I thought on this book – she devoured it in two days.<br /><br />It’s truly a classic.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|If you liked her first book, you'll love this one too. It took me a little while to get into this because I loved Rachel and Dex,but I eventually learned to love Darcy as well. Giffin does a great job of bringing you right into the characters and th their lives. You feel like they are your best friends as well.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Brown continues to make you use your brain and think of the possibilities that there may be more than one answer to any question.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Allie Brosh's storytelling is straightforward and half-cocked, but full of earnestness that is utterly charming. Her simple drawings often reveal more complex emotions than the best illustrators can offer.<br /><br />This is a must-read for anyone who is affected by depression, whether you have it yourself or are watching a loved one struggle. Brosh's explanation of clinical depression is accessible to virtually everyone. While every person's experience with clinical depression is unique, you will find a way to relate to her story.<br /><br />My only regret is that I don't have enough money to buy physical copies for everyone I know in addition to the Kindle edition.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I don't like how it ended. Took me forever to finish the book. Just wish the ending was different since they aren't making another book.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love interest I have it on all if my devices and have had any issues. I recently updated the app in my kindle, now when I go to open the link of the pin it won't load :(
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a cool game but it glitches ALOT but I think it's fun so I think you should try it out because you'll like you too.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Oh my God this game is. The best game ever the mall and the beach are the bestist ones ;) lol
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I love this game. The characters are so cute the accessories are cute . And the best part is is updates and I think the toca boca games are so good for kids and I just love it so much:)
0062107313|4.0|This novel starts in 1905, in Shanghi, where Violet Minturn, a girl of Chinese-American descent, lives with her mother, Lucia, the mistress of the most exclusive courtesan house in the city. Violet is spoiled and sees her self strictly as American. When she realizes she's also of Chinese descent, she struggles to find her identity. Separated from her mother as a young teen, Violet becomes a courtesan--it's not a lifestyle she's chosen, but one she's forced into by a slippery friend of her mother's. A large part of the novel follows Violet as she moves through life--bad choices and all. At times, I found myself wondering why someone would make the choices she did because there's no way those choices could turn out well.<br /><br />In chapters 1-11, Violet is the main character. In chapter 12, the novel flashes back to sixteen year old Lucia Minturn and 1897 San Fransisco and fills in the gaps of how and why Lucia ended up owning the finest courtesan house in Shanghai. The next few chapters cover Lucia's story before moving back into Violet's point of view and the Chinese countryside in 1926. The novel ends with all loose ends tied up--but I didn't find it very satisfying.<br /><br />I'm glad I read the book, but...I found myself reading parts word for word, and skimming through other parts. Tan does an excellent job of portraying the courtesan lifestyle, but I found myself wanting to care for the characters, but not really connecting. I think the length of the book--over 550 pages--lead me to expect more, in learning more about the inner workings of the characters, especially of Flora, Violet's daughter. The reader learns much about Violet and Lucia, but much about Flora remains unknown--and I think that's what put me off a bit from this book. But still, it's Amy Tan. Maybe not one of her better works, but still worth reading.
B007SGM084|5.0|It's an awesome love story. I know a lot say they sex books. No they are not just about sex, sex is just extra. I was not an avid reader until I read these books. Now I'm reading all kinds :)
B00GINENG0|3.0|This is probably the third time Tom restarted to a baby and its driving me crazy. Other than the restarting Tom it is a great app.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Love, love, love this movie--which is unusual for me and a sequel.  The last time it happened was with the Dark Knight because of Heath Ledger as the Joker.  Once again, it is the &#34;Bad Guy&#34; who makes the movie outstanding for me.  Benedict Cumberbatch, who is great in Sherlock, elevates the movie for me.  I think everyone else was fine, but Cumberbatch--what a &#34;bad guy&#34;!  Love J.J. Abrams too.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is a very good game. I love it. This game is cool because it is based on the movie.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I've tried all levels, so now I'll go back to best my times. I'm sure that will be a real challenge. No ads, the best part!
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|After the disappointments of the Hellen Trilogy I almost didn't spend the money. The characters I previously had so much enjoyed were well out-of-character,Pendergast weak, self pitying and ineffectual, Vincent betraying Pendergast's trust and the royalty over the top plot of Two Graves nearly finished me on Pendergast, Preston and Child. It was with reluctance and trepidation that I purchased White Fire.  I am glad I did, however The old Pendergast is back or at least nearly so. If you like I have been disappointed ,and dare I say it disguised by the recent turn the Pendergast books have taken read White Fire. It might rest or your faith.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Well, I am so happy that I have another place to play this wonderful game. Been missing it for a long time.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Its fun and interesting but the thing is, that there is no ending! But other than that it's fun!!! I love it!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|If you like adventuring, this is the fastest way to do it. I have a hard time putting my kindle down when I play.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I am on my third restart because it jams up but I reinstall everytime!  I love it.<br />I'm glad I don't pay actual money for anything.
B005F9TQ0Q|5.0|My first copy of this was a cassette which eventually wore out. My CD was borrowed and never returned.I love this album. Haven't listened to all the songs in years, but &#34;Forever Young&#34; should be on everyone's playlist !!
B00G32OMF8|2.0|I didn't care for this &#34;movie&#34; - nothing but a narration of couples, old and young, about ideas about life and love.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is the best. I can play it for hours. Levels get harder as you go. Very fun. Great for kids.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I liked playing this game on face book but I really enjoy playing this game on my Kindle Fire. There is no more energy to wait for and the game move fast yet you can go at your own pace. You also get your rewards faster, which makes it even better. I am having much more fun with this version.
1892005034|5.0|It's a well written book containing life changing information.  I'm sharing it with my friends, family and anyone who will listen long enough for me to tell them about it..
B00GLX0Z8C|5.0|The movie does not disappoint and we laughed from the beginning to the end!<br />Jennifer Aniston and Jason Sudeikis are hilarious!!
B00FHB7398|5.0|I really enjoyed this game even though it takes an entire FOUR to SIX seconds to load some scenes! Seriously ....how sad that people actually complained but, then I can remember when a television had to warm up a few minutes before it came on. This is a beautiful game to experience with so much to do and questions to be answered. Lots of hidden object scenes and clever puzzles. Has the zoom feature and atmospheric music but, the cut scenes are just wonderful and made me think of &quot;myst &quot; (that is a good thing) Bonus chapter gives you some background on the villain and her motives. Very much a top notch game. I played this on the first gen. kindle fire with no problems. Priced right too. Thanks and back pats to Big Fish Games.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game!!!!! It's fun and entertaining I could play it for hours!! I like that you can change areas.
B00CDTSFF8|5.0|Best new show of the year!!!  Acting, plot, costumes, everything has beaten my expectations and if you like period pieces this is a definite for you!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Can't stop playing<br /><br />To much fun I love this application really love to play it<br /><br />This is a blast but pissed me off at same time
B007R11DKQ|5.0|Great movie, really enjoyed it.  It kept my attention. Love to see it again this time with friends.  I highly recommend this movie.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My son turned nine. Got this for his birthday. Now wants the other two. The village and nether. Lego makes good products.
B001O1O71C|4.0|It is the aspect of child logic that I appreciate. They seem so much nearer to true creative energy than adults most often are.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It wasn't that easy to set up. It took me several times even though I repeated the same things to get it done.
B0026IUXO2|5.0|This is an amazing period drama with a slew of exceptional actors like John Geilgood, Christopher Eccleston, and even Kate Blanchet excels as the lead role too. Loved the character portrayals, costumes and sets too they really captured the period and as a Brit from what I could see appeared to be historically accurate too. A must see if you like period dramas.
B00CEF014E|1.0|This book was almost the first book I never finished. Full of inconsistencies and nonsense paragraphs. What a waste of money and time.
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|This movie has virtually no decent acting, a feeble plot with a lot of holes in it, and a lot of missed opportunities for a good storyline. What it does have is lots of CGI and mindless action. So think well-made B movie robots vs monsters and you'll be happy.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I play it on my friends kindle and I love it now I play it on mine the object of the game is really just to shoot game in the right place.overall this is one of the best games!
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Great story and writing.  Some parts are difficult to read but you'll want to finish.  Lots of details and twists in the plot.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|I have been reading and happily following Pendergast for many years.  The stories have never failed to entertain me and draw me into another world.  Thanks for not killing off Corrie and looking forward to the addition of  Stacey into the story.
0486407217|5.0|I got this book to inspire me with ideas on Victorian outfits for dolls. Wow! This is a fascinating book on the women's clothing of that era and has tons of pictures and illustrations! This book will not disappoint any fan of Victorian era women's clothing.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|This book is definitely one of the most personal of the Pendergast novels and gives much insight into the character and also those he associates with. It is a must read for any fan of the series.
B00CTT9646|5.0|My son was an actor on Star Trek: Enterprise for two years. He still lives in LA. The phaser was a birthday present for him. He was thrilled with it, so I am thrilled too.
B00G922EA2|5.0|I really enjoyed this game, couldn't put it down, so only disappointment was when I'd finished it. Not too many search puzzles as some other games, good time waster, hope you enjoy too.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is a great game! But i also agree that updates should come sooner. I want horses. Redstone needed. Slender men and enderdragon and dungeons with monster spawners. Most importantly, SKIN CHANGES!!!!!!! I dont care HOW, just get it.
B00GINENG0|4.0|It is good but not great. It is really fun but there is limited things for you to do sometimes it freezes up on me
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book makes me wonder was someone paid to give a good review. Thankfully I did not purchase this book a friend loaned it to and had not bother to read it. Why are they bothering to do a movie on this book when there are so many books that would put this book to shame.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Nothing to complain about. Another terrific episode in the adventures of Jack Reacher, the Lone Ranger, with one Tonto after another playing the role of sidekick, some not surviving the current episode, none surviving as a character in the next episode. The series is not getting old, 'redundant, or stale.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I CAN SEE WHY EVERYONE IS PLAYING THIS GAME, ALL MY FAMILY IS PLAYING THIS GAME AND A LOT OF MY BINGO FRIENDS TOO ! One word about this game  ADDICTIVE !!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|this book is truly amazing! it is so much of nothing you would ever expect! it really touched me :)
B008S80P38|4.0|Great album.  Track 9 has had a skip since day one.  Not sure why or if it's something that can be resolved?
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Got this as a gift and I love the watch. It looks nicer in person and it fits my large wrists.  I am not over weight but I am 6 foot 3 inches and find most watches do not fit well.  This one does and looks nice for working outside
B005ETA5K2|4.0|works as intended.  works with everything as expected. I used this for back track and it worked great. Drivers were found with ease
B005HED11Y|4.0|I grew up watching &#34;Star Trek.&#34; It was in viewing the shows that gave me a sense of unity as the crew of the &#34;Enterprize&#34; stood behind their captain 100%. If Kirk were to ever lead them into a death trap, they would have had no problem facing it as a team, as one.<br /><br />I'm about to start running my own enterprize, and I can only hope my crew would be just as dedicated.
B00AH69ZN0|5.0|I knew was i was getting when i downloaded Metallica it onto my phone they ROCK good to go to the range put your buds under your ear protection and rock out while u practic
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|Ok, I am not a techy person, so I am most excited that this combo has Blu-ray/DVD/CD plus lots more. What a great deal! My family loves watching this movie, and we have listened to the cd several times. The reprint of 1965 Theatrical Souvenir Book and the post cards are beautiful, and the little music box adds a nice touch. Everything came packed in a beautiful collector's case. Overall, I am very excited about this purchase. I wish all movies came in a set like this!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is truly one of the best games I have ever played there's so much action and I love the fact that you can dress them up with things you buy from the coins that you earn my five stars are not a mistake they are true you should definitely get this game you won't regret it

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this app I play it almost every day great app for kindle nothing wrong with it either you should get it, it is awesome
B002SJIO5E|5.0|I want to focus on some features of this movie that intrigue me, without giving away too much of the plot for readers who might not have seen the movie.  First of all is the humor. Some of this is satirical.  For example, the idea of a group of humans going to an alien concentration camp (for that is in effect what District 9 is) to get aliens who look like giant shellfish to sign documents agreeing to their eviction is on its face funny, and the movie doesn't shy away from presenting some of the interactions with the aliens in that way.  The protagonist, Wikus van der Merwe, is so gung-ho and determined to be good-naturedly effective in his job of getting the signatures that you almost have to laugh.  And the naive good nature he shows is perhaps why his father-in-law, who obviously dislikes him, has tapped him for the job of overseeing the evictions and relocation to another camp further from Johannesburg -- he expects him to fail or do badly and perhaps diminish him in the eyes of his wife, whom he adores and who seems to love him in return.  But the broader humor comes later, when Wikus has formed an alliance with an alien called Christopher Jones (that's funny too), and man and prawn prepare to do battle -- and in fact battle rather well -- against the mercenary forces arrayed against them after the authorities have decided that Wikus has in effect \\"gone native.\\"  This is the odd-couple aspect -- they like each other (and need each other too), and like Butch and Sundance, or more closely, Han Solo and Chewbacca, there is a wonderful scene of them running through a hail of bullets untouched, just as the good guys did in the old westerns.  The fact that Christopher is a man-sized prawn with legs makes it all the funnier.  There's also humor in the scene where the superstitious Nigerian arms-dealer who has set up shop in the camp wants to eat Wikus's arm.<br /><br />All of this shows the director Neill Blomkamp's confidence in his control of tone.  The real triumph of the movie, in terms of its relation to the audience, is how gradually we come to root for the aliens (and Wikus), for they are really initially quite repulsive, with their slimy, snaky-tendrilled faces and their reliance on cat food, consumed straight from the can, as a staple.  But we get used to them, and we can't get away from the fact that there's something xenophobic about the authorities' hassling them.  In particular, the mercenary Koobus Venter, who is called on to eliminate Wikus and who takes such obvious pleasure in killing.  Wikus does a good deal of killing himself, albeit in self-defense, but his \\"Come and get me\\" attitude to authorities we have every reason to distrust, doesn't dwell so much on gore as on Wikus's lone-cowboy attitude.  The guys he gets have it coming, we feel, and Blomkamp is careful not to individualize them.<br /><br />A sentimental feature of the movie, without which it perhaps couldn't work, is that the aliens turn out to be not so alien after all.  They care for each other; Christopher obviously cares for his child, who is as cute as only a little prawn can be -- but who knows how to deal with some sophisticated gadgetry.  And that's another thing -- the aliens are highly intelligent too.  What they lack to get out of their predicament is a certain liquid with which to reactivate their ship.  How that liquid is recovered is the main focus of the action-packed center of the movie.  The emotional core of the movie is focused in a brief scene in a pause in that action, when, in a laboratory basement where the liquid has been stored, Christopher finds the corpses of aliens who have obviously been subject to experimentation.  (We learn later that the authorities are trying to isolate the DNA that will enable them to perhaps activate the alien weaponry, which can only be used by aliens).  Christopher is, so to speak, unmanned by what he sees in that lab -- and the audience feels for him, despite his obvious \\"otherness.\\"  But that's because by that point the other doesn't seem so other.  Much to the director's credit, that political implication is never explicit in the movie, but it's the source of its power to move us and engage us.  I recommend this movie -- get over the initial shock of creepy-crawly faces, and be surprised.s because by that point the other doesn't seem so other.

B005JCT4B0|5.0|Whaaaat! Are you serious? 5 CD's for 21 bucks? Wow at these prices I can get everything I have ever wanted. Delivery can only be topped by Teleportation!
B0081ISUOG|5.0|Simple interface-- I like that because simple = no interface lag. Has lap, countdown, export to file, etc. and more.<br /><br />A great all around, no nonsense, yet powerful stopwatch/timer and clearly the best I have seen yet on Android!<br /><br />Also, I have yet to duplicate this issue about supposedly needing to be logged into the amazon app store for this application to work-- I have found that to not be the case. I even went so far as to temporarily uninstall the amazon app store itself and this app still worked.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|This game is awesome, but I have purchased credits twice and they were not credited! The money was taken from my account. When I tried to email the game sight the send button did not work. AMAZON HAS NOT RETURNED THE CREDITS EITHER.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|This game is not going to win any awards for cleverness in design, however it is well put together and it is fun even though it is ridiculously easy to beat. As a free app of the day I give this 5 stars-- but as a paid app I would have to say four stars. However,  since I got it when was the free app of the day? 5 stars.<br /><br />What would I do to make this game more fun? I would add even more mini games. If I was going to have a story at all I would at least spend some time on crafting it instead of including it as what appears to be an afterthought. I would include a pan and zoom feature so that people with poor eyesight and smaller screen devices can still enjoy the game. I would expand upon the soundtrack. I would diversify the puzzles even more. And I certainly wouldn't make it a clone of any of my other games.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Well, now that I'm satisfied I've read all about \\"fifty\\"......Will there be a sequel?  I can't see the fun ending with this book!  I now have TWO favorite authors!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game I sooooooo fun and cool. I love to play it and I play it all the time. if you are reading this, YOU HAVE TO GET THIS GAME!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Best game out there now we need Pet Rescue Saga available on kindle also. Love this game. Lets get all the Saga games on Kindle.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is amazing especially since it has been updated. Thinking about any possible further updates is very nerve wrecking. I love it!!
B00BAXFAJC|1.0|I bought this as a kindle book because of the lead up and promotion by amazon.com.  I forced myself to read it to the end,  only to search for the missing last chapter.  The italicized chapter summaries reminded me of a child's school preparation for what was never written.  I cannot believe this won the Man Booker prize.
B00C70FH7M|5.0|My favorite album of 2013 by far.  The whole thing flows really well when played altogether.  They found such a powerful singer in Ashe O'hara.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is just really cool because there is not just one level and one character. Also I like how it changes themes from things like Christmas to Valentine's day.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Easy to download. It makes reading  very convenient and easy! Pages look great, having your book so handy is a great thing because you access them anytime you want!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Best game ever<br />You never get tried of thus game<br />Free download the way the family's and element is my country in the term yahoo dot the term matter,atom and the family's
1401938906|3.0|The book is full of funny, positive, and up-lifting thoughts.  However, I tried a few of the exercises and had no results, at least not those she said would happen.  The one that I really wanted to work, a sign that the Universe was working hasn't worked yet and I've tried it several times.  Oh well. Fun read but may take practice..
B006X08FDA|4.0|This is a great CD! Kind of Foot stomping music.<br />Great music. Worth buying the CD or even<br />Getting for a stocking stuffer.<br /><br />Raven
0743243153|5.0|This is a really great book, a must read along the road of life. I have read other books of Dr. Peck's, a very wise man.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It was such a great book. I am reading it in class but I read ahead. I love the story. How Aggie had to overcome his face and go to school. I love that people be came friends with he even know he might have an ugly face.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|The movie is very good.i have seen such movie after a long time.i have learnt a lot from this movie.this movie teaches us that we should not give up in our life.we should give our best to the work.we should not lose hope.i strongly recommend this movie to people.they should watch the movie and learn something from it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Second book by Collins keeps you reading and wanting to know more all the time. Look forward to the last book in this trilogy.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|The game is fun and addictive, however very irritating to have to wait up to 20 min to play if I don't pass a level. I've only had the app 2 days, so I'll give it a week before I decide to delete or not.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Very good game. The graphics are great and the guns are really cool. Only needs an update where you can upgrade energy. I have to fly a lot for work and I cannot stand the moments when you do not have energy to hunt. Altogether though, Deer Hunter 2014 is a great, free game and another astonishing project from Glu.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|The kids and I have had a blast playing this game. Fun for all families. We like the different places that you can buy. My youngest daughter likes to cut down the trees.
0385537131|5.0|Since I am such a big fan of John Grisham, I expect nothing but the best from him and this one was one of the best.
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|This is the best aindroid game I have played graphics are great game play is great to. It's worth the 3.00$ by far
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Excellent playful nonsense with hints of wisdom revealed along the thin and unpredictable edge between reality and .... something else?
B000A7DVRC|5.0|Truly iconic tale of laid back &#34;Dude&#34; as he unravels a mystery within a mystery.  Am I wrong??  Am I wrong??
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a cute book.  I enjoyed the characters and the story line between the two main characters.  I'm glad I gave it a chance as romance novels aren't usually what I like to read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it but needs more stuff but still amazing ITS WORTH BUYING I play on it all the time
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game! It's fun and exciting and addicting because once you start it's hard to stop! Everyone will love it!
0920668364|5.0|Always a great gift....bought this for a first-time mother who is a friend of mine.  Gave this to her with the verse from this story framed.
1558908846|3.0|Stallone was ok but the rest of the casting was so bad. I remember when I first watched a long time ago and still mattered when I purchased a DVD and watched again. The futuristic Buildings are too random and have no style like Blade runner, and above all the movie has no particular color.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I'm a newbie to the game. Therefore, I passed the first few levels by hit and miss guessing.  I will have my grandchildren show me more skillful techniques.  Fun pass time if you are waiting.
B003DEIRYQ|4.0|Well, these guys have been around for a long time, and they always seem to keep a fresh sound.  This album has some good hits on it with a few that i usually skip over, but to each their own.<br /><br />The Foo still keep it real in this age where &#34;artists&#34; pretty much ditch their talent and just try to be celebrities in the spotlight.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love to do yoga while listening to this app! It feels so much more peaceful. I also use it if my daughter is having trouble sleeping and it calms her right down. I've even turned it on for myself  before. It's very relaxing and useful.
006202406X|5.0|Love this trilogy.  I was very happy with the prompt delivery and great condition this book was in.  I am very happy with this purchase.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Excellent writing, fabulous work. Many reviewers complained about the ending, but I thought it was highly appropriate. As another review wrote, those who didn't like the ending may have missed the point here.<br />In any case, this novel is well written from beginning to end, full of suspense, tension, memorable characters, twists and turns and whether you like the ending or not, it's worth reading to get there.
B008469DGY|4.0|Fun and addicting.  I would definitely recommend this game to anyone.  Don't usually buy apps just for no ads but I bought this one.
B00BRUQ3PS|4.0|Great book by a great author, but you have to have read the other two books in the triology first.  Not Atwoods' best work, but if you've read the earlier books in this series, you are going to want to read this one no matter what any reviewer says. If you haven't read the first two and you are an Atwood fan or a fan of dystopian science fiction, you seriously need to catch up on your reading!

B0071XO8RA|3.0|Wool is a fine work-I'd give it 3.5 stars if Amazon would let me.<br /><br />I was disappointed primarily because of all the 5 star ratings-somehow I expected something more. Anyway, it's highly readable, fairly well written, etc. but nothing spectacular in its genre which is my requirement for 4/5 stars.  I think most readers of science fiction/dystopias would enjoy it, but all the hype it has gotten may leave some, like myself, a tad disappointed-less because of the work itself, which is fairly solid, although as some have pointed out, a bit weak in the technoligical reality dept., (so it you are a stickler for that........) than because all the 5 star reviews that raised my expectations to a level not quite met.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini takes us on a Afghan journey through time, space and geography that is at once breathtakingly beautiful and profoundly heartwrenching. And the Mountains Echoed provides us with rich characters that we can admire, despise, and come to know intimately enough to empathize with their strengths and weaknesses, as if they were our own.<br /><br />The language with which Hosseini describes the Afghanistan of yesteryear and the place we all think we've come to know in present day media is evocative, and I left the book feeling that I knew and understood more of the essence of this troubled nation -- full of people striving to build stable lives for themselves and their families.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Just started but having a ball, great graphics, really entertaining!!!!  :) have to see how the harder levels are wooooohoooo..
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I own 3 of these critters.  Purchased all of them via Google's Play store as they were not available for delivery from amazon at the time I ordered them.<br /><br />They do basically what they say they do.<br /><br />o Play Netflix (very well for me)<br />o Play YouTube (good to poor due to network congestion via ISP, or throttling.. Peering issues)<br />o Casting from the Chrome browser works pretty good.  Use this quite bit.<br /><br />However, there seems to be a big hold up by Google on additional development<br /><br />o There are a number of new apps just waiting for Google to allow them to be released but Google so far is not moving. huh?<br />o No ability to share or cast from a mobile device yet (tablet, Phone) which is what I was really waiting for due to the above.<br />o No new apps released by Google since it released the Device.<br /><br />So while the device does what it says it will, development seems to be a complete stand still, NOT because the developers don't have new stuff to provide, but because Google seems to be sitting on this for some reason.<br /><br />IF Google starts allowing development to be released, this will get a much better mark, but for now it is pretty much stuck using Netflix, YouTube, and a few of the other Google service's Music etc..  Note that I can pretty much do this with my DVR, a lot of TV's have this ability in them already.<br /><br />Rather disappointing in what could be a great platform from what I've seen from developers.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The &#34;old&#34; John Grisham is back!  Loved this book.  This is the type of writing he does best.  You are rooting for the underdog all the way!!

B0070ZLZ1G|4.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who cares about children. Nurturing our children when they are very young impacts their brains in amazingly beneficial ways. Character has more impact on success than IQ does. Prepare to adjust your priorities.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I bought 2 of these several months ago and they're both still going strong.<br /><br />The scroll wheel has gotten stiffer over time, but I have this same problem with every mouse I've ever gotten (Razer, Logitech).<br /><br />It's at least as good as the mice I've paid 2-3x for.  I've had Logitechs that have lasted years and others that have lasted only a few months, and I've broken Razers within days.<br /><br />Ergonomics are very good, and build quality is also very nice.  The side buttons feel a little cheap to the touch, but they're solid.<br /><br />The teflon pads are holding up very well.<br /><br />I do wish they'd make a model without the weights or back LED and sell it for even cheaper :D
B00CRVZRUS|5.0|Never saw this movie but loved A hard days night so bought it and LOVE it. Being in color is the best part and great songs!

1476729085|5.0|Here's a book that was born to be a best-seller. Melbourne professor Don Tillman has decided that he needs a wife, but so far his efforts to find the right woman have meet with failure--in fact, often with disaster. He hits on the idea of screening &#34;candidates&#34; with a 16-page questionnaire, and the field studies are hilarious. And then along came Rosie, a bartender who is pretty much the antithesis of Tillman's so-called perfect wife.<br /><br />The &#34;Wife Project&#34; soon goes off the rails as he finds himself more and more absorbed in solving a problem that is troubling Rosie.  Though he is a man who lives by rules, lists and schedules, they all go out the window and his life is thrown into chaos by this unlikely companion.<br /><br />With the book presented in the first person through Don Tillman's point of view, we get a hilarious look at his world with no editorial filter. It's a great ride! Laugh-out-loud funny, warm and fast-moving. This is a seriously polished book, a stunning debut that deserves to be a prize-winning best-seller; and of course, that's what it is. If you haven't read &#34;The Rosie Project&#34; yet, what are you waiting for?
0062060554|5.0|What a thriller.  Totally spellbinding.  I loved every minute of it. I couldn't put the book down-it just fascinated me.

B00DAPOHU6|5.0|I love Jack's music. I have for years.  This is a great new album. My husband is even listening to it.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I am a huge Star Wars fan and have enjoyed all six movies. I've always loved the worlds, characters, and stories to the Star Wars films. I decided to review each individual film to give my thoughts on each.    Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace    The Phantom Menace, which is the beginning of the saga, is my least favorite of the three prequels. It's not exactly Star Wars-y and Jar Jar Binks is annoying. However, though those things are true, that doesn't mean it's un-enjoyable. The problems are clear, but the Phantom Menace is quite far from being a bad movie. The main hero, Qui-Gon Jinn, and the main villain, Darth Maul, are some of the best characters in the Star Wars saga, and the film features an interesting story and epic battle sequences. The Blu-Ray version of this film replaces that bad Yoda puppet with the awesome CGI one, which is good, being as that was one of my biggest problems with this movie. Perhaps my biggest problem other than Jar Jar Binks is, like Return of the Jedi, the film is a little too slow. However, upon seeing it on Blu Ray, I was strongly impressed with how good the CGI was. Obviously, there were some ugly spots (it IS a 1999 movie, after all), but there were also many impressive spots, too. Though it's the least like Star Wars, it's place in the canon is clear. It's not an unnecessary movie, and it is quite enjoyable too.    The Phantom Menace Final Score: 7.5/10    Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones    Attack of the Clones fixes my problem with The Phantom Menace not being very Star Wars-y and improves on it in most ways. The story is even more interesting and is crucial to the Star Wars saga. Though The Phantom Menace was quite epic, some of the most memorable scenes in Star Wars come from Attack of the Clones. Yoda using his lightsaber for the first time to viewers and the Jedi coliseum fight are just to name a few. Though it does suffer from a cliche romance and some bad acting (particularly Natalie Portman, who I've never seen act very well), the pros to Attack of the Clones make those cons seem unnoticeable. Just before you begin to throw up at Anakin and Padme's romance scenes, the film cuts off to Obi-Wan and his more interesting plot. Also, this movie contains a lot of nods to IV, V, and VI; such as the Death Star plans and Anakin losing one of his hands. Is there too much CGI? I personally don't think so. Unlike movies like Peter Jackson's The Hobbit Trilogy, pretty much all of the CGI is needed to complete the movie (try creating Courascant with \\"practical effects\\"). Out of all the Star Wars films, this one is my second favorite, mainly because it was the film that got me into the franchise. (Don't judge me!)    Attack of the Clones Final Score: 8.7/10    Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith    Revenge of the Sith is by far my favorite Star Wars film. It has the best story, some of the best action, and a distinct lacking of things such as bad acting and romance. I've always liked the acting to the Star Wars films, but even actors like Hayden Christensen, who I've never cared much for, were actually pretty good (unfortunately, Natalie Portman never seems to improve). Anakin himself was a much more likable guy (until, you know, he kills the innocent children), which is explained due to the fact that he's older. One of the many things that makes Episode III great is that it is easily the darkest of the Star Wars movies. The dramatic transformation into Darth Vader was very moving, and my heart sunk to my stomach when I saw the brotherly bond between Anakin and Obi-Wan shatter. This film has hardly anything wrong with it, despite a bad line or two. The satisfying finale to the Star Wars saga (because it was released in theaters last) boasts some of the best special effects and action sequences of any sci-fi movie to date. Seriously, this movie is amazing.    Revenge of the Sith Final Score: 9.5/10    Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope    The start to the Original Trilogy is very well made, filled with memorable characters and great special effects and music. The story actually isn't that original. It's a simple rebellion story with a sci-fi twist. It's by no means bad. In fact, that was probably the best way to make an old sci-fi film. This is made up for with the characters. Pretty much everybody recognizes Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan (Ben) Kenobi, and Darth Vader. The characters are very well developed (even though it's still gross that Leia kissed her brother), and are remembered for good reason. The thing I dislike most about this movie is its ending. The great villain Darth Vader is defeated as simply as he was isn't exactly a satisfying conclusion (I'm big into spectacular fight scenes). It's a good thing that there were two more chapters after it, because the Star Wars story wouldn't have been that great if it had ended there.    A New Hope Final Score: 8.2/10    Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back    The Empire Strikes Back is very similar to A New Hope. In fact, it took me forever to decide which film I like better. Episode IV had a better beginning, but a worse ending. I ultimately decided that since Episode V had a better more climactic ending (featuring a great lightsaber battle and the famous \\"I am your father\\" line), it was my preferred movie. Like Episode IV, the story is relatively simple. The great characters return, and new ones are introduced such as Lando, Han's old friend. The Jedi master Yoda's introduction was very funny and was a great way to introduce the character (back in the day). What's great is that the puppet is so realistic that it doesn't need to be replaced by a CGI model unlike the one in theatrical release of The Phantom Menace. Being one of the darkest Star Wars films (second to Episode III) Episode V is a great film and a true classic.    The Empire Strikes Back Final Score: 8.5/10    Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi    To me, Return of the Jedi is the weakest Star Wars film. Not just in the Original Trilogy, but in the entire six-part saga. Though it ends the series well, that's pretty much all it does. The Original Trilogy was one big story where IV was the beginning, V was the middle, and VI was the end. That being said, Episode VI has virtually no story of it's own, except for a couple of repeats of IV's plot (e.g. blowing up the Death Star). All it does is end the story. I wish that this film had a bit more of a plot like the first five films did. This film suffers from too much filler. Most of the Endor events and characters (particuarly Ewoks) are really uninteresting. Now don't get me wrong, it's a great way to finish to the series. I'm just saying that's almost all it's good for. I can't watch it without watching IV and V first. Even still, the way the ending is pulled off is great. The climactic battle between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader carries a lot of emotional depth and is very satisfying for the chronological end of the saga (until, you know, Episode VII comes out in 2015).    Return of the Jedi Final Score: 6.8/10    The Verdict    As I said before, I am a huge Star Wars fan. I grew up watching both Originals and Prequels, so I'm not exactly biased to any in particular. Ever since I saw Episode II in theaters (I had seen IV, V, and VI on DVD earlier), Star Wars has been one of my favorite movie franchises. These films truly are classics and being able to own all six on Blu-ray is a great thing to do. That, plus it coming with tons of bonus features, is enough to say how easy it is for me to recommend this collection. This package is great purchase for any Star Wars fan.    Goodbye. And may the force be with you.

B00190N4E4|5.0|Gandhi movie was based on the real life of Mahatma Gandhi, West India born, he lead his country to freedom from the British Empire through a nonviolent approach. Gandhi realized that Indians had been made into second-class citizens in their own country. He begins a protest of civil disobedience that is first ignored by the British, then scorned, and finally, hesitantly, dealt with, sometimes by deception, sometimes by brutality.<br />Gandhi took the ideas of Christ and tried to implement them by faithfully adhering to Hinduism. But he did not realize there were forces already at work in his lifetime, converting the Hindu religion. Gandhi believed in judging people of other faiths from their stand point rather than his own. He welcomed contact of Hinduism with other religions, especially the Christian doctrines, for he did not want to be debarred from adapting good anywhere else. He believed a respectful study of other's religion was a sacred duty and it did not reduce respect for one's own. He believed it was his right and duty to point out the defects of his own religion, but to desist from doing so with other's faith. He refused to abuse a man for his fanatical deeds for he tried to see them from the other person's point of view. He believed Jesus expressed the will and spirit of God but could not accept Jesus as the only incarnate son of God. If Jesus was like God or God himself, then all men were like God or God Himself. He believed all great religions were fundamentally equal and that there should be innate respect for them, not just mutual tolerance. He felt a person wanting to convert should try to be a good follower of his own faith rather than seek goodness in change of faith.
B003F9G8B8|5.0|Excellent acting, especially Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon.  I was surprised to learn that my eighth grade students knew nothing about apartheid, so as a conclusion to a unit on the subject of apartheid and South Africa, I plan on showing this very inspiring movie to the students, as it shows how life really was in South Africa during this time period, and gives them a glimpse of another culture very unlike their own.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It'd it better if they gave us more to work with when we're stuck on a game instead of always having to pay for every little thing:/

B002PNER9U|5.0|Whoa! I had never heard of this, until a friend mentioned it. This is  so incredibly awesome!! I wish I had bought it.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|The book w a s overall great , smooth and intriguing just like Divergent and Insurgent. Only complaint that I have is that there were multiple unnecessary deaths (this may just be the depressed fan girl in side of me…) but I loved how Roth went on to describe what was going on in the rest of the world; because in dystopian books (like hunger games) the what and why are not usually explained. The ending from Tobias was very good but I would say that my inner fan girl is very disappointed about what happens to tris. WHY VERIONICA WHY???????<br />[I did love the series and part of being a fan girl is being disappointed by your current obsession only to find it leading to your newest obsession]<br /><br />Happy reading! :D
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|My husband has this on his razr maxx phone. I saw it for my kindle and decided to try it. I am very impressed by the high quality graphics and excellent options for gameplay.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Awesome! Thought provoking, and dark, while touching. Couldn't put it down. Beautifully written. Read it soon you won't be sorry.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is not a genre I usually read from, but I took a chance based on the many good reviews.  Wow!  Loved this book.  Loved the story and the imagination it took to create it.  Loved the characters. The constant tension and suspense really kept me reading! About twice per year, I will love a book so much that I am reading in every spare moment:  the Kindle will be propped up in the kitchen as I am cooking, it will be propped up in bed with me, it will come with me to appointments, and I will even read through meals.  This was a book like that!  Now I can't wait to get the others! Great job!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I did not see that ending coming!<br />The first book in this series, divergent was my favorite of the trilogy!<br />You rock Veronica Roth!
B00GO95BUU|1.0|Soooo, when will The Day of the Doctor actually be released.  I don't have cable and can't make it to the screenings.  I just want to watch it from a legitimate source...but with this lack of information/availability, I understand why people pirate...
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|At this point John Grisham probably couldn't write a bad story if he tried.  Mr. Grisham is at the top of his craft and has produced an enjoyable read. This courtroom drama moves along with his customary brisk efficiency, bringing back<br />attorney Jake Brigance and some of the characters from his first novel “A Time to Kill”.  There is not a lot of suspense since we know the hero and his friends will win and, about 2/3 of the way through, it becomes obvious how they will do that.  Early on you will probably also guess, at least in general terms, the book’s big secret.  But Mr. Grisham is always an entertaining writer and keeps the reader’s attention all the way through.  I didn’t find this as compelling as some other reviewers but is certainly an enjoyable read.  Recommended.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|GREAT STORY.  HAD ME GUESSING TO THE END AS TO THE MOTIVE FOR THE LEGACY!!  JOHN GRISHAM'S BACK TO TELLING A GREAT STORY,
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|I expected a little more. I like learning more about Ky's background and his motives. The switching back and forth of perspectives gets a little confusing toward the end, but all in all, I will pick up the final book in the series to see what happens to the characters.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|the reveiw is nice but eh I prefer full version and I created a mod- guys will enjoy it very much ;D
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I loved this book so much. It reminds me to be kind to others and to just be yourself! It really was a life learning book and, to not worry what others think of you just be you. Thanks you for writing this book, i learned a lot from it. I give this book a five star rating:)
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Can't wait to see the second installment. Reneted this to &#34;remember&#34; what happened t he first time around. Love this series
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is so fun for me. The  only reason I gave this a four star is because it takes to much time to show you how to do something

B00FWLDHSY|5.0|This movie was awesome. Had some sad parts but it ended good. Not gonna try to spoil anything to people who didn't watch it yet.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I absolutely loved the first 2 books in this series.  But this 3rd book was absolutely devastating...  The twist in events at the end were very unnecessary!
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|The movie shed some light on just how narrow a line Lincoln had to walk in order to move the country forward. It also shows us that disagreement and politics are no different today than they were in Lincoln's day. Definitely enjoyable for its ability to bring the political drama of that time to life from every angle.
0061537969|5.0|This is the best dog book ever, I recommend it to all who love their loyal dog friends! Can be emotional, but all in a good way!
B007HACDLK|4.0|Vince Flynn has written another good one in his Mitch Rapp series. I have read everything Flynn has written and they are all great books. He will be greatly missed by this reader and many others!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|It's a very good application.  I highly recommend it.  I love the bible plans that are easily accessible.  As for the personal information that the application may ask of you, you do have the choice of either accepting or denying access to your personal information.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Only app I have ever purchased and I love it. Well worth it. Actually, I got lucky and got this off amazon during a free day. Never thought I would say this, but I wish my computer had this feature.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is a great read. It tells both Chris's side and the feelings of the loved one left behind, his wife. This is a grueling story with the telling of what it takes to be a Seal.This is right up there with the Stephen Hunter books.
B00190N4E4|5.0|The story of Mahatma Gandhi was quite intriguing to me. Gandhi is such an inspiring man and the story played so well with the true and honest man he was.  The way he interpreted the world and his views are unique and so intricate in the sense that many leaders of this world have applied his concept. Gandhi was the father of India. He helped the many lived he influenced across a many of villages in Africa. His compassion and love made for a man with many loving traits. He freed India from the hands of the British. He was a lawyer in South Africa who was unfortunately assassinated at the age of 78 on 30 January 1948. This film is a wonderful summary of the life of a man who is counted one of the greatest that have lived.  A quote that I find it very meaningful from the movie: “An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind,” - Mahatma Gandhi.
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|Patricia Cornwell does it again! This is perhaps her best book yet.  Gripping from the start and moving at the pace your mind craves for details as the story unfolds.  Amazing entertainment!
0316074314|2.0|I support literary fiction.  I READ literary fiction.  But this one.....when you take on an 800 page book, one takes on a type of marriage in which both partners must feel a certain commitment.  For 100 pages I have held on trying to form such a commitment with The Luminaries, which by all the favorable reviews sounds like something I would enjoy, should enjoy, but...I've given up, for now at least.  I cannot become engaged on even the most basic elements, like characters, which is so far all there is.  Endless male characters who connect to each other only vaguely and point only vaguely toward some eventual STORY that might be intended to be told.  Maybe someday I'll come back to this book and try to finish it, but for now I've picked up a different 800 pager--The Agony and the Ecstasy by Irving Stone, an historical fiction about Michelangelo.  This one engaged me immediately, and I'm in awe of the Man, the writer, the Renaissance, about which I realize I need to know much more than I do...Isn't that what books are supposed to do?  Draw us in, create curiosity, awe, expansion of the soul?  Sorry, but the Luminaries doesn't do it for me.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I am totally addicted to this game!!! Well worth purchasing! I own more  then one and intend on buying more!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Great game and very thinking gAme that make  You addict. More logic gAme and finding missing pictures  or words to go next level and gets many rewards.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a great game for all ages. I was very glad when you put it on kindlefire as I can't always play on my computer.  Greatest feature is your extra lives never fade  away, you can have 100 or 5 , except of kindlefire you're limited to 5. Tough  part is your dependencies on friends to help get to extra levels, it's a must  !!  One thing I can't figure out is why I'm at two different levels my kindlefire  has me higher  than the computer. You need to fix this problem soon.  Match game is what  CANDY CRUSH is all about, with super candys to explode for a rush on more points. Just try it once &amp; you'll be hooked!!!
B00D8CSVLW|5.0|I loved the fact that John Grisham keeps you wondering until the end and then comes with a magnificent ending to the book. I would recommend this book to all who read A Time to Kill as well as those who didn't. It's a fantastic Court Room Drama written magnificently!
B00AE1P8UM|5.0|It's as if all the knowledge acquired in my life were here. Easy to read, easy to practice and most of all, full of biblical wisdom words absolutely present and modern. Definitely a book to read more than once and to share with every single person in our lives.
B00EJOCAYW|5.0|My kids Loved it! Lego has really brought Creativity from the minecraft game. I bought the other two available out there. Hope they make more
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Amazingly beautiful!  This is unlike any other Christmas CD you've ever owned! Some of their renditions brought tears to my eyes. This would be a wonderful gift for a dying loved one to listen to this holiday season.
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|I picked up this game as a time waster before larger, more heavy games.  I recently hosted a gaming night where we played quite a few times, with this thrown in between sessions.  To my surprise this was the game the group kept wanting to come back to again and again.<br /><br />This game is a very well polished system, involving luck and strategy that almost anyone will pick up after just a few rounds.<br /><br />My only complaint is the cards seem like they would be pretty worn after a time, which is not good since you have to keep your cards secret and any telling details would sort of ruin things.  Though, I'm not sure what could be done about this.  I don't have a lot of experience with high quality cards; so maybe that would help.
B0086449YA|5.0|My husband and I are big fans of Mark Knopflers, and have most of his music, so this was indeed included.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love minecraft pc it's a very fun game you get to build create and destroy and just have fun but like all games it needs a few tweaks:1. Skins. Im so sick of being a boy cause I'm a girl so if u can did girl skins and other skins thank u.2: More mobs. It needs more mobs like endermen and cave spiders and other cool mobs.3: needs villagers. It would be way better to have villages so u could trade with them and steal stuff.4: to make it fun it needs mods so it can be way more fun5: needs more ores blocks weapons  cool things mobs skins tools<br /> Other then that ur doing a great job losing thank u!:-) ps my brother brought a minecraft shirt and it looks so lol thanks for making minecraft mojang thanks a lot!:-)
1476729085|4.0|I thought that the book was well written and funny yet sensitive to a number of issues raised. A light but satisfying read.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|it works perfectly and simply.  no problems with them at all.  I ordered four, one for my main computer in the kitchen, another in my bedroom and the other two for my daughter.  and I like that the connection is long enough to be easy to use.
B000AY74OG|5.0|When my daughter and grandchildren moved out and took this movie with them, I had to get another copy for myself.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great book  by John Grisham AGAIN.  It is very true to form for him.  Great plot, great characters and a very good book.  I think Grisham may well be the best author of our time.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This game is very addictive. I don't like when it freezes but it's fun. My entire family plays it.Try it.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Pretty good book...I will read number two.  Nice character development.  Why must I write ten more words...this isn't a book, it is a critique of a book.  Can you spell succsinct?  Obviously, neither can I.
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|This gamenhad a good long storyline. There are lots of cars in many colours that ha e different levles which is great but they don't show damage which stincks. I personally appriciate that you can earn $ once you complete the story. You can also own cars and they will spawn near you once you compleate a mission. So overall this is the best gangstar game so far and is top notch as far a mobile GTA colts go.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|i got a golden chip! first one ive ever bought thats intel and it overclocked to 5.1 ghz with only a 1.28 vcore!<br /><br />im about ready to void my warranty and knock the IHS off and get some cool laboratory pro in there
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is fun I really enjoy it. I am addicted. This version is better then the Facebook one. This one moves faster.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is a beautiful written book.  I came into this<br />book with doubts of enjoying.  I am very happy that I was wrong. Reading books about the Holocaust, I am livid regarding Hitler.  So to read of the heart of these characters were worthy.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The book was the best book ever. So touching and I loved every minute of it. Can't wait for the movie
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's totally AWESOME But 0.8.0 is out and Amazon is not updating far the update so yah all I really want to say is it is awesome buy the game and get block launcher pro so you get maps mods texture packs and a skin signed OSUGladiator
B009LOJK1Q|4.0|King is a good writer and a good story teller. I enjoyed this book but some of the themes were derivative of others ie. The Stand.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It was the best gam I ever had you people need to get this game good storey fun you get to jump on tranes
B0034DGPEU|3.0|This started out like an exciting read.  The story line was too predictable.  The facts were treated fairly.  Slavery and indenture were part of that time period.  It was almost like a popular romance paper back.  If you like that type of story then this is for you.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Good to pass the time. Would give it a 10/5 but it won't let you. It also goes and sells items while you are offline. You need internet connection to play
B003TSEL7S|5.0|i dont now if i am like you but i love jason and piper l like leo to i like all of them but i think this book is the best in the heros of Olympus nd yes i have read all 4 but i not going to tell you about the book i am like that so read the book if you haven't<br /><br />from angel
0061950726|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read and I read several a week.  The side by side stories of the 91 year old Orphan Trade rider and the troubled 17 year old was very well written.  The pages just urge to keep turning them so you can see what happens next.  The picture painted of the perils these children faced caused the tears to flow and in the next instance the modern day problems of the 17 year old leap out at you.  Couldn't put this book down.  It encouraged me to try other books with this subject matter, fiction and non-fiction.  I encourage all to take a little trip to the America of the 1920s and what the immigrants to this country endured.
B0053TMP24|1.0|for me the book was not good i think it is because i dont like percy jackson haters can hate on me and lovers can love i found a new guy jason and go piper and leo you rock i think lost hero is way better to me i like hazel and frank that is all i have to say<br /><br />boo for son of neptous i now i did not spell that right sorry rick riorden i now i did not spell that right i love your wrighting<br /><br />  from angel
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|This game is not bad.  It helps to kill the time when you have nothing left to do between classes.
B0062O85IW|5.0|I use Excel every day and would consider myself solidly in the middle of being an intermediate user. This is a great reference. If you use excel at all you should have this book.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|The Goldfinch is one of the most stylistically beautifully written books I've read in a long time.  The descriptive language is, like the fictitious painting at the heart of this novel, a work of art. And yet the story with it's intrigue and mystery keep me riveted--never wanting to put the book down.  The convoluted story is mesmerizing and the chance and coincidence always feel perfectly plausible.  I love this book!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So fun and addictive! Its kinda hard at first but the more i practiced the better i got! Love it!
B00E00P5JC|2.0|Of my 2 boys and 2 girls, only my 8 year-old son said he liked the movie and would watch it again.  This is a movie that adults will not enjoy and, if you do purchase it, you should let your kids watch alone.  I really enjoyed watching animated movies like The Bee Movie and Toy Story because of the humor, but I only laughed once in Turbo despite it using voice characters in other movies I enjoyed.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|This was bought as a gift for my wife, however I forgot to indicate that on my purchase.  It's a good movie.
0385537131|4.0|I have read all of Grishams books and have liked most of them.  &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; and &#34;The Pelican Brief&#34; were perhaps my favorites. And since this book was linked to &#34;Time to Kill&#34;,  I thought this book, too, was well written and so was another example of Grishams&#34; fine  writing.  I was glad to read it and would recommend it to all of the authors' fans.  I have read so many  murder mysteries and have become used to many of the authors and the characters portrayed in their books that I find Grishams&#34; books always like going back to an old friend.  As I have said before, this author has been easy to  read and so perhaps I have sometimes been a little disappointed because of my familiarity with the style of writing.  But I always wait for his books and add it to my Kindle library  . UPER Roy
0156012197|5.0|This was bought as a gift, unfortunately I neglected to mark it as such, however my friend says she enjoyed the book.
0375805621|5.0|My 13 month old son absolutely loves this book. I enjoy reading it to him in the voices of Elmo and Grover.  I think this book will be on his list of favorites for years to come.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This is such a classic and I'm glad I finally have a copy of my own instead of waiting for it to come on TV once a year.
0375805613|5.0|Every child should own a copy of this book. This was one of my favorites from childhood and I'm sure my son will love it as much as I did.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|loved the series and these DVD's were in perfect condition........always a chance on used DVD's but this was a winner
0723257639|1.0|Boxed set 1-23<br />This review is regarding the poor printing quality of the books that are currently being sold.<br /><br />Message to Amazon:I just ordered the presentation 23-box set and several individual books. The books are all printed in China. The quality of the printing is so poorly done that I am returning $200 worth of books. I am writing to ask if this is the new standard of publishing for Beatrix Potter books. I am working on a graduate paper and have purchased a large number of books written by Judy Taylor, Margaret Lane, and Leslie Linder--all experts in the work of Beatrix Potter. I purchased the complete set of books and individual ones so that I can compare the different editions with the original privately edition printed in 1901, the first Frederick Warne & Co. published edition in 1902, the centenary edition published in 2002, and the 110th edition published in 2012. There is a huge difference in the printing quality in paper texture and color quality with the recent new editions being sold by Amazon. The earlier new printings Amazon sold have an almost satin quality to them. The later ones have a rough almost grainy texture. The printing on all the recent editions appears as if they were printed on machines with low toner. The text and picture colors appear faded as if printed by amateurs. The quality is unbelievably poor!<br /><br />Is there a quality control on these books? Is anyone checking to make sure that what is being sent to customers is a standard that you approve of? From all my research on Beatrix Potter, I understand she wanted to have the books printed as cheaply as possible to be able to reach as many children as possible, but 111 years later, we should expect a higher quality than what is being published opposed to even one year ago. Children and adults deserve a much better quality that is being produced at this time in China.<br /><br />February 28, 1938, Beatrix Potter gave advice to Josephine and Delmar Banner regarding publication of their artwork. Rather than to have their work reproduced badly, she advised them to redesign the pages to allow for current publishing practices because, &#34;Children deserve the best&#34; (Letters 387).<br /><br />Can you assure me that the quality of the books you sell are good quality and not these poorly printed editions?<br /><br />Can someone follow-up with me to see what is being done about the poor quality of these books being sold on Amazon.com? Read the reviews and you will see this is a huge problem. I am a loyal Amazon customer. You can tell by my order history. You always stand behind the quality of your merchandise. I hope you will investigate and require answers from the vendors you are purchasing these books from. If this a problem with Penguin publishers in UK, they need to step up and implement a review of their quality control practices.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Amazing book, has something for everyone.  Makes you really feel for cancer patients and survivors.  If you're hesitating, don't.  You won't be disappointed.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|need more money run out all the time.  which is good because i would be playing it to much, like
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is the lowest cost and easiest device to use to access Netflix and other similar services on your flat screen TV. And it does more! Works great using your smartphone as a remote. I was previously using a Roku 3 and before that Apple TV. Would not go back. I recommend this to all my friends and on my todayspersonalcomputing web site.
B00A757EFW|4.0|this game is good for coordination, which id don't seem to have, i always get eaten up.  its great young people game
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele has a gift. He richness in vocals, the ability to tell a story, and connect with the listener is outstanding. Can't wait to see what her future holds!!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I destroy the world on a regular basis while putting my kid down to bed, or nap... while waiting at the doctors (haha).  Its super addicting and the learning curve is easy to go from mild evil overlord to alien mastermind.  Its a well spent buck is what im trying to say.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel. I turned each page anxiously anticipating Max`s next move.  Great storyline.  John Grisham wrote an excellent book.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved the book. It was emotional which a good book should be. I wish there was a squeal. That's why this book is a 5 star book.
B00FPH6AXE|2.0|This movie shoots itself in the foot over and over again, and though there are a few minutes of genuinely entertaining stuff, most of it is either painfully boring or downright laughable. Jaden Smith is OK, but he needs to get acting classes or something. Will Smith's dad character is too morose and kind of a douche, and while that may be the point, he never gained any sympathy from me. Which is a sign of just how much this movie misses the mark, since I found no sympathy for WILL SMITH.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|An excellent read, hard to put down. Terrific character development as usual. Nice twists and turns. Any Grisham fan will love it.
1423101499|5.0|My daughter read it and she says, 'It was captivating, and was really, really good.&#34; She's enjoyed all the books in this series.
1452110581|5.0|so great...laughed all the way through and will pass it on forever. i am so glad that i got this.  it is going to honolulu soon.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|It is super super awesome. I love the superpowers. This is my first time playing it and I love it. You guys should make updates every month.
B00APKIN1I|5.0|A fantastic documentary, and look behind the scenes at the history of this iconic studio.<br />D.G. does a great job on it!
B005COO1X6|5.0|I enjoyed this short story very much! it had the suspense of a King novel and it had just long enough for a short flight.
B00BCCEBRI|5.0|What can I say, this is the ultimate Bream Collection. And at this price for such a set, well Christmas is coming, and any Bream fan would be delighted to get this puppy!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I am a fan of John Grisham's courtroom novels and this one didn't let me down, it was riveting and I couldn't put it down. The ending wasn't a big surprise, but I didn't expect it be, the author slipped in little hints. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good read.
B00F35BV64|4.0|This movie was pretty good, but nothing beats the original from the '60's!  The real, classic Star Trek is far better!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love playing Candy Crush on my Kindle. Thank you for allowing this addictive game to Kindle. I can't put it down.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|you suck i love the game but bate the time limet. good bye heaters and lower the full edition to 0 bucks.
B000VIK8D0|5.0|This was one of the best family movies I saw in a long time. No cursing, no explicit sex scenes, just a great story that kept you watching and waiting for the end. It was a long movie, and  didn't drag. I love watching Kevin Costner  in movies and this part suited him.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I loved every bit of this book..hard to put down...didn't understand some of the low ratings, Ken Follett has my attention.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I'm stuck on level 14, so it feels frustrating, and I'm not willing to pay money to get shortcuts/hints.  It was fun as I just learned how to play it, but once I got stuck, it took the fun out of it!
0670858048|5.0|What a great buy!  My kids are crazy over the book - and so are my husband and I!  It's a favorite bedtime choice around here.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I Choose 5 Stars Because My Grandma Sue And My Dad James And I Love This Game When We Are Getting Board We Play This Game We Love It!  WARNING: YOU WILL NEVER WON'T TO STOP PLAYING THIS GAME ONCE YOU START PLAYING THIS GAME!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I enjoy this game very much. I play it on my iphone, facebook, and my Kindle Fire. Only issue is sometimes it doesn't refresh, so you should be careful that it shows you are on the correct level.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Twitter is awesome and it works especially great on the kindle fire. I'm on it all the time &amp; sometimes it freezes up but I think that's just my Kindle, not the app. I say get it!!!!!
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|With any luck at all, this vital and important release will propel Paul to take to the stage performing just Paul McCartney songs. No Beatles. Just McCartney. He can start with 'Save Us' from NEW and work through three hours of 'My Brave Face', 'Put It There', 'Tug of War', 'Sing The Changes', 'The Songs We Were Singing', 'Helen Wheels', and mucho more. After fifty years of giving the people what they want, it's time we free McCartney from the musical museum we've put him in, and let him manifest his great, boundless talent, like he did all those years ago.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This is awesome it is different from the game on Facebook there's more to it here. What I really like is u can even play when it not online
B00DJZR4A2|5.0|It's really hard to describe without going into every cliche in the pundit's playbook how good THE DIVING BOARD truly is.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|It got me to learn piano and learn fun favorite and amazing songs.the song we wish you a merry Christmas is the finest song to learn
B00DY951RQ|5.0|Now we all understand what this 'Piece of shi*! is and was: the blueprint to the rootsy, more organic americana sound we all hype and hyperbolize about.
B00FRQ32N4|1.0|Once I try to update this this game that's when it stopped working. It doesn't update and won't play either. Once it does I would to rate it a 5. Please help me or fix the problem. Thank you.
B00D2I8E46|5.0|Costello just continues to leave his contemporaries in the dust. The angry young man is howling at the wankers again with a killer band behind him.
0740797719|5.0|This book is fantastic. I'm not a &#34;realist painter&#34; at all, and because of that I can say that this book can be very useful not only for realist painters, but to artists of various kinds. I believe that if you understand the realistic aspects of world (the forms, anatomy, colors and all) you'll be able to manipulate it in the way you found more interesting, and that's why this book is so amazing, 'cause it gives us a complete and detailed guide and valuable tips to understanding light and color in a way I've never seen another book about this subject do. So, do you want a good lecture to enhance your light and colors habilities in your art, realistic or non realistic? This is the book, you won't regret it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Awesome game that you can't put down.addicting  but wish there were more free moves that you would receive for the higher levels
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I'm obviously not the only one angered by the trilogy that wasn't.  Any entertainment I was getting out of the series was totally erased when I got to the end of book 3 and realized I'd been had. By the time book 4 finally comes around I hope I will have forgotten the whole aggravating experience.  I'm done.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Definite need for tablets or phones ... hourly. Day. And weekly views. And alerts for severe weather warnings make it an essential ... I am very pleased.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I can't remember the last time a book made me laugh hysterically. This is a fantastic book. I have already ordered it for one friend, but am thinking there is no one I know who wouldn't love this. Not only is it hilarious, but the drawings are perfect in their simplicity and unexpectedly funny.  My one and only complaint is that the book is too short. I want more!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Challenging and fun with lots of different levels, each level adds another surprising challenge to keep the game from becoming boring.
0143119680|5.0|liked this book and wanted to read more but it got a little convoluted and I am ited of reading about witches, vampires and were wolves. going back to the love stories with normal ppl for a little while
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Unicornlove is great love the little girl and the missions are fun and exciting.Yeah yeah it is a little bit of money to much of a little busy right to much of the fundraiser for awhile before we had
B005DOL0R0|1.0|hate this cover and just ordered another one. it is for carrying it around only but it doesn't hold it like the first one i got so I had to order another one
B003QSHIPS|2.0|The Album is good, but my record came in s***ty quality, like someone deliberately tried to mess it up, it has scratches on the best songs, this is a darn shame.
B008JFUOVI|1.0|Honestly it was really bad. I would maybe give it two stars but because it must be compared to the first two Hangover movies then I need to give it just one. It never should have been made, that's how bad it is. It just ain't funny, and this is coming from someone that LOVED the first one and definitely enjoyed the second one. It feels rushed, with not much plot, not many gags -- same players but they have NOTHING to work with. Shouldn't have been released, shame on the producers for just trying to cash in again. I'm sure they did cash in, but it wasn't because this was anything close to a funny movie. Too bad, it would have been fun to have a final hurrah with the gang but this fails miserably.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Great movie, Daniel Craig is an awesome Bond and the storyline really brings his character back into the original Bond line. You'll need to watch it as I don't want to spoil a great ending.
B00005K424|5.0|It is a fun game that is much more challenging than it looks.  Somewhat similar to tic tac toe, but much more challenging!
B0073COMKW|5.0|12/6/2014:  Going strong!    It does what the description says.  Time will tell whether it holds up or not.  I use it in a table lamp and I wish I had gotten a brighter one.  I will buy a 13 watt and move this one into a light we leave on all the time in the kitchen
B00DSLZCR4|5.0|excellent, funny and full of 150% hyperbole!  This is exactly why I am a fan of her work.  Much of the content I have seen before but has been reworked and the new content is hilarious and fits in well.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|The game itself is good. What I hate is having to connect to Facebook and beg friends in order to move up. They should be other options.
