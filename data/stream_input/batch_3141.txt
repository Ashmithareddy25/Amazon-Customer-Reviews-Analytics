B00AHG9KYE|1.0|A disappointing conclusion to an excellent series.  I really wish is would have paid attention to the other reviews that said the same thing.
B005QMOZOO|1.0|Jane Austin understood romance PD James managed to kill it! ... and mutilate it and almost ruin Jane's book for me
B00364K6YW|5.0|All time classic.  If you appreciate good acting and a great story, this is a great mini series.  It is still the best version of Pride and Prejudice, hands down.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush is the best game ever. Great for unwinding at the end of the day. Challenging enough to keep you entertained.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I gave this book to my husband for his 80th birthday and he had never read John Grisham before...He can't put his kindle down and said it is one of the very best books he ever read...I will have to read it next...Thank you RB
B00F8GYC1Y|1.0|I really couldn't get hooked on this version as I did the others.  It seems slow moving and unexciting.  I think the characters are boring.
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|The movie was both encouraging and terrifying.  Superman is almost a god in this movie, but the Kryptonians themselves were practically demonic.  And we're not just talking about General Zog.  The Kryptonians are here for the second time, and the only reason we exist is because they failed to destroy us before civilization ever began.  It speaks to the problem of Fermi's paradox, and the fact that the night sky is not a benevolent void.  The front story is both heart and action.  It's uplifting and encouraging.  The back story is as dark as it gets.  I was surprised by this film, and loved it.
B009LDD4V4|5.0|Bones is one of my favorite shows. I own all of the DVDs and have not been dissapointed yet. Their bloopers are my favorite and their auto commentaries are amazing as well. Definitely worth buying
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love that this game lets you play as a minion. And its something to do when you have nothing to do. lol
B00BPDR3F6|2.0|This book had very little sex in it and yet it was all about sex.  No one was happy and no one got what they wanted.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Well,written book and a very good story.  I had to get used to the style of writing, but I really enjoyed this book.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Dr. Alexander writes well and the book was enjoyable, but it was just so short.  The time he spent in Heaven is a brief account and the rest is his explanations as to how, as a man of science, he knows his journey was real.  I wanted to spend more time in Heaven with him.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|It needs to connect to your Facebook account in order to fully enjoy the game. This is not a feature I enjoy.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|There is an update but it's not updating. But I really like this game, it's fun easy. Just waiting for the update that is not there but need.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game for Kindle. Non stop fun on kindle. Not as good as full version but it is awesome. Cool game
0425252868|4.0|This is a fine story: it's a unique view of the daily life in the German air force during WWII. We can read a lot about the American and British point of view, but the Germans are usually seen as just the enemy - not so here. It's worth reading just to gain the understanding of why the Germans joined the Luftwaffe and why they continued to fight even after all hope was lost.    It's well researched. I'm a WWII aviation history buff; I found very few glitches and I even learned a few things. The glitches I found were minor - for instance, there's one mention of the \\"tubes and transistors\\" in the B-17's radio (the transistor wasn't invented until after the war). There's another mention of Franz' new Bf-109G, and the next page says that the unit only had old airplanes. None of these detracts from the story.    The only beef I have is with the writing style: the choppy sentences and simple vocabulary make it seem like it was aimed at a younger audience. That's not a bad thing. Young people especially should read this book, for the history, the compassion that's shown on both sides, and to see how insane this war was - and by extension, all wars.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|It did not allow for anything that it said it would on the description, it would not work and it wanted me to PAY for a full version of it when &#34;YOUTUBE&#34; is supposed to be free anyways it was very buggy and unclear how to use.  My wife downloaded it on her IPAD and deleted it pretty much the same night and so did i.
0596809158|4.0|I love the organization of this book. You need a quick example of code with a clear description? This is the book to get. Great for learning from scratch, and reference. For more complete treatments of R, it should be paired with another book, but this is a must buy for people who want to become proficient in the software
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|I enjoy all Grisham books, this one I figured out how it was going to end  halfway through it. Usually there is a big twist at the end of his books,  This is the first time I knew the ending before turning the pages. It did leave room for another sequel......
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Good time  wasting game. I haven't been playing long, but I'm enjoying it. Good g game to play on my break at work.
1452126607|5.0|I had Salvador Dali the last two years and wanted something humorous for next year.  I chose this one because I like cats and it looked funny.  Ryk
B003G4W49C|5.0|All my kids read the book in high school ages (now) 41, 21, 18.  The movie couldn't have been made until now (due to technology).  So I took them all to see the movie on opening night.  Of course the book<br />was better because the movie wasn't long enough to include all the details.  I reread the book before we went to the movie to refresh my memory.
B00F8LPH90|5.0|It is a fun game of Skill and Accuracy it is not like those other zombie shooter games where you see blood and gore all over the place which i do not like at all.  Simple yet complicated mission make sure the humans which show up as WHITE on your radar can get to the bunker to safety.  One thing i really like that was not in the previous version that i played in the past is once you rescue a certain amount of HUMANS you actually get a mode that is just you and the Zombies with out any fear of killing humans because this mode takes them out of the equation and you are free to drop missles and gun fire where ever you feel like it I have gotten as much as almost 600 Zombies taken out on those stages.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am glad that candy crush is on a kindle. I was playing it all day long until I had to go to bed and the bathroom. THANKS AMAZON !!!!!!!. Candy crush is the best game ever.
B00GH4R95C|2.0|The bad : Many plot holes, bad script, bad dialogue ...<br /><br />The good : Cool visuals, some really decent shots, but overpacked with action.<br /><br />The result : All in all , its just another &#34;Transformers&#34; but not as fun. &#34;Superman&#34; should be more than that ....<br />it's not the next &#34;Dark Knight&#34; ... not at ALL
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This is a great game. Beautiful graphics on my Kindle Fire. Fun story line with cute characters. A great app when you have some down time.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I just LOVE this game and you will LOVE it to. If YOU have MINION RUSH YOU Will know what it's like. If you don't have MINION RUSH it's a surprise.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I cried so hard!! I have grown so attached to these books and they exceeded my expectations. Must read books!!!! You won't be sorry!
0007466064|5.0|Awesome book in an awesome series!!! Hurry up Martin!!  I can't wait for the next book or the next season.
B00FJU1HLC|5.0|Great Family Movie for everyone parents, tween and toddler.  Just wish we would have bought it instead of renting it!!
B000P12LWY|5.0|Absolutely awesome. Highly recommend for anyone who has any interest in this time period. Johnathan Reese Myers is a gem!
B004EF65QA|5.0|Truly remarkable experience to watch a story unfold with grace and emotion.  North and South simply envelopes one with lush scenery, costumes and especially people.  It's worth watching over and over, sometimes  for the romance, sometimes for submerging oneself in Victorian England, sometimes for the new industry central to the theme but always for the people.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Best game out there!  I want more of this caliber.  Great, no fantastic graphics.  It kept both me and my 7 year old genius grandchild busy for days.
B003O86FMW|5.0|As if this series couldn't get any better...she does it again. This one had many differences so that those who are reading the whole trilogy will stay engaged. Great action and suspense! I read right through to the the third book.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Great Science Fiction. Well written and directed. Terrific cast! This is one of JJ Abrams better efforts. I will be watching all the seasons on Prime.  Thanks.
B00E3VTR1K|5.0|This collection of short stories is absolutely amazing.<br /><br />Ranging across a wide range of genres and characters, each has such unexpected twist and turns, that I frequently found my jaw drop in surprise my head shaking in astonishment.<br /><br />Unbelievably good!
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Great mystery.  You think you know the outcome but are constantly challenged in that assumption. This is a great plot.
B001BANK32|5.0|I had seen the movie of The Shining, but never felt the need to read the book.  Now with his new book about the character Danny, I felt the need to read it, and I'm glad I did.  The movie was good, but a lot of details from the book were missing.  All I can say is it was so worth the $ I paid for it!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I bought this to read for a second time in preparation for the release of the movie.  I read it a long time ago, and enjoyed it just as much this second time.  And, of course, went to see the film right after it opened.  Both were great
B008ROG6E0|5.0|It is hard to believe this movie was released in 1976. This story written by William F. Nolan and George Clayton Johnson is about a lie and deception. How a society can have a low regard for others and the miracle of life. Abortion at 30 is really what is happening. Time to reflection on some of the decision our society is making. A good cast and of course, Peter Ustinov's character is superb. I am glad I watched this movie again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's the ideal game for people of all ages.  If you  like temple run, you'll like this five times more.
B001OL4TR4|5.0|This was Rutger Hauer's best movie, at least, in the sense that he got to play the hero. Michelle Pfeiffer was excellent , Matthew Broderick was very good as Phillip, the Mouse. The score was great.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Best book I have read in a long time. I found it so captivating I had a very hard time putting it down and going to sleep. What a fantastic story of courage, forgivness, redemption, fellowship and brotherhood. This would be the one book I would want if I could only read one book a year.
B00FPH3YQA|3.0|Not near as funny as first two of the series. Was more of an action movie. The language was raw in parts.
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|I loved it! This is the best ever! And it arrived before what I was waiting! Can't wait for the next!
B008MWBY6W|3.0|build quality could be better. strip buckle was broken after two weeks of not intensive use. would expect it to last little more .
B00FX8F6VM|5.0|LOve it! love it!! love it!! LOve it! love it!! love it!!LOve it! love it!! love it!! LOve it! love it!! love it!!LOve it! love it!! love it!! You will love this song! awesome beat, good dance song- everytime I hear it I start dancing!
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|I really liked this book. Very cool plot and world. I smiled a lot at David's failure with the metaphors. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy/adventure books. I couldn't give it five stars because I sort of guessed the ending with one of the Reckoners being an Epic. What can I say? Brandon Sanderson has blown my mind in the past with some of his stories, particularly the great finishes. This one fell slightly short. I was still very pleased with the book though.
B00425S1H8|5.0|Used with my AEM UEGO Wideband to log my afr's in Accesstuner Race for my Subaru WRX. Worked with windows 7, had to keep adjusting transfer rate before my computer would recognize it.
B004MNO0BQ|4.0|This is too much fun and so stressing at the same time.  I worked my way up to the INSANE level... gives your index finger or whichever one you use a workout. :)
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Easy fun read that gives a ton of insight into the Jobs life prior to being a somebody. Learn great insight in how to be a great business man find peace within ones self. How to look at religion a new way, and so much more.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Don't particularly care for plain solitare; but decided to try SPIDER. It is HOURS of enjoyment if you like solitare ~ but this game is better. Lots of fun!!! There are several ways in arriving to completion of all the suites. Just be aware of how you are moving the cards to make your suite. Gets you to thinking :D
0061537934|5.0|Wonderful book, whether you love dogs or racing, or neither. When someone asks if I have any recommendations for a good book, The Art of Racing in the Rain, always tops my list.
B00FN811SY|5.0|I was not able to upload this to my Kindle tablet, but have been waiting for it for quite a while.  Would love to have it when it is available then I can rate it from experience.  I have other members of the family and friends who do have this app and they say how wonderful and helpful it is so now I am awaiting for it to be ready for my Kindle Fire HD.  Please get it soon.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|It was an entertaining movie and Pitt does a good job but the plot is a bit of a stretch. Not to do a spoiler if you don't know but, considering popular TV, think about what the &#34;Z&#34; stands for. Glad I didn't buy it but watching it wasn't a total waste of time.
B003RNXIBK|2.0|Better than the previous cd but not the same classic song writer he used to be. Not only have the lyrics crippled down a bit but his vocals are not the same  it used to be either. Eminem was at the peak when he retired but this is just decent at best. The only two great songs are space bound and Cinderella man. Eminem went from pissed off I hate the world rapper to mainstream pop hip hop artists.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|This is a Great Story.  It is written so well that I did not even realize that I had read half the book. I remained Interested in the characters and what happens to them.  I felt a strangeness walking past the Metropolitan museum.  Thank goodness it was so long because I did not want the book to end.  I originally read the book on Kindle but then had to have the real book to keep.  I look forward to rereading.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was amazing. I loved it. So many excellent reviews that there is nothing I can really add. I am not a YA fan but this book was a suspenseful exhilarating story.
B00B47NO2O|3.0|are they really going to do another season of this....I have to say the first 6 or 8 episodes were a bit tiresome.. then the last 5 episodes began to come together.  Jury is out whether I would purchase the series again.  I think I will just join Netflix and see it on their programing instead.
B007EE4XKI|4.0|Wow. When Mr. Mack does not like something he fixes with spades! If this is the set up then next two books will be fantasic.<br />But Worf needs a break.
B00028HBKC|5.0|This is not about entertainment.  It is about knowing the truth, and experiencing the gritty reality of what Jesus Christ did for us.  This movie makes you FEEL the power and depth of His sacrifice.  It left me speechless, even stunned, in the stark realization of the enormous debt we owe.  For what He did, He deserves nothing less than our complete allegiance and loyalty.  We owe Him our very lives, and nothing else really matters.
B008FRFN7A|4.0|Great application!!  Nothing more pleasant than printing directly from your smart mobile device!  It takes a little to find the printer and some times several tries, that is why I don't give it the five stars, but apart from that, it would deserve them.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Its a great game to play when it doesn't freeze. And being that whenever it does freeze my tokens are not reinstated. I won 11450 coins on the slots and the game frozed 3 times. Each time it took 800 coins and then wiped out all my coins. Sent a message to support and I was told that they couldn't refund the coins because they have no way of knowing if and when the coins were lost.
B00G32VYDG|4.0|This film was more than I expected from just seeing the previews at the theater. The special effects were outstanding and the creatures makeup was very surprising but well done. Jeff Bridges and Ryan Reynolds were very good.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|A great inside look into history, almost as if you are in the club. Learn new things, best back story was Hoover and Truman.
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|Great re-make of the original movie, making the movie a little more true to life. The effects were terrific, I really enjoyed the movie and so did my children. The original movie with Christopher Reeves was exciting when it came out the &#34;Man of Steele&#34; movie was improved to be a little more realistic allowing for a connection to modern day audiences. This movie has no swearing in it, no sex scenes, lots of action and effects, very good movie! I will see it again, and so will my kids.
0307887960|5.0|This diet does work, I do recommend it although I did lose motivation after a year of limited carbs. But the success is worth it and I am recommiting.
B00CL8D83U|4.0|It's a very different sound, much more Techno and dance than pop.  I really love the song &#34;Bolshy&#34;  you can tell here that this is good Pet Shop Boys and at the same time with a different twist.
B00DHHWXYY|3.0|I have not watched the dvd yet, after I watch I will rate it, I can't it until I see it
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|Outview (The Inner Movement) by Brant Legg is the second from this series I've read. In my opinion Legg is a uniquely gifted writer and storyteller. Expert in bringing his characters to life, emotionally connecting with his readers. Luring them in to only want more. My mind and body cycled through just about every emotion imaginable with this captivating fantasy thriller extraordinaire. A fast paced thriller that electrified.<br /><br />Sympathy, compassion, fear, excitement, happiness, despair, sadness, confusion, the list goes on. A story of the tragic life of the main character Nate Ryder. A young boy that lost his father at just the age of 12, estranged now from his mother. Also having to live with the fact his brother Dustin was sent to a mental institution for a few years, taken from him when he had nothing.<br /><br />In order to make sense of the overpowering &#34;outviews&#34; Nate was having at night, and to make sense of his troubling thoughts, he had to free his brother. He needed answers. With the help of his good friend Kyle and his cousin Linh, amongst others, he accomplished that. Nate believed he was truly going crazy and needed desperately to hear otherwise. On his journey he discovers that his father was murdered, died for who he was and the supernatural powers he possessed, which both he and his brother Dustin, along with their Aunt Rose had too. Realizing now all their lives were in danger, they had to battle the odds together and win the fight against time to unravel the secret as to what this all meant.<br />The depth and passion from which Legg writes is truly extraordinary. This book deserves to be read and I can't recommend it enough. WOW!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I've started many books that have not kept me interested, they remain unfinished. Not this one.  Could hardly put it down.
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|Very interesting story & premise, I just wanted it to go so much further. There were many stories that were started and then never developed; also the characterization of the main character, Mae, never explained how she became so gullible. This book could've been really wonderful, and as others have said, would make a great movie (and one I would definitely go see), but as literature, it failed to meet my expectations, though the premise was creepy enough to have made for a fabulous literary experience.
B00DSTBMMU|4.0|I always have loved Sheryl crow and with the exception of a couple songs , it does not seem to be much of a change in her sound.  I really love the song &#34;Give it to me&#34;  it's a Sheryl Crow classic.
B002XXUWMI|5.0|Great story, great effects, I wish it had a sequel or something, the spin off could go on for a very long time.
B0091REZMW|4.0|It is a good game.  I like it so far and the game seems to be like a few other hidden object searches that I have played.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|This has a different feel from some of Eminem's older stuff but I LOVE IT! He's aged, I've aged but change is a good thing with music. Check it out!
0767903862|5.0|It's not necessary to go to Australia to feel Australia.  Just read Bill Bryson.  One of the best travel writers ever.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Beyond addictive, this can be an obsessive game.....and extremely difficult to get to the next level. For me, there doesn't seem to be much calculating the best moves as much as just luck of the draw. If I take the time to play a computer game, I want it to have some brain benefit and fun. Not just pretty colors and sounds along with frustration.
B00008CMR6|5.0|What can I say, one of John Wayne's best..  I have remembered scenes from this movie since first seeing it as a girl..
1451695195|5.0|I totally enjoyed this mans experience with how it is to almost die and come back to tell us about it.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|i wouldn't buy this item.<br /><br />it has a great potential, but still not working good.<br />item got stock several times, and Google blocked from watching any movie from the computer.
B008DM4OTA|2.0|I think my two year old is just too young for this. When she wants to play it, I do most of the &#34;playing&#34; for her. Maybe it's better for older kiddos.
B0086700CM|5.0|I recommend this app completely it is very fun and addictive. It is safe for all ages so you don't have to hide it from your parents!
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Many of the challenges are not attainable in upper levels without purchasing lives, and the playing time is excessively limited.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|VERY addicting!! I had stopped for a while but came back to the game. It is nice to play when I can't sleep. I do wish some of the levels were a little easier to finish. I like that I can actually use my lives that friends send on the app, however, I do wish I could use extra moves on any level, not just the one I had been stuck on.
B00GI8AMI8|4.0|The ONLY reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because when I quit playing, none of my progress was saved--I had to start over from the beginning (and I was almost at the end).  When I opened it again, the menu screen did not give me the option to RESUME, as it should have--it was either START or PLAY (can't recall which) and it took me to the beginning.  Started over, and was able to exit and RESUME ok, and play ok on my Kindle Fire 2nd gen.  Thanks, Echo Lake Interactive.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|It would've gotten 5 stars, but I wish it had more tunes. After a while they start to get redundant and annoying. Besides me wanting more tunes, (Lol), this is a great app.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|Her voice is just amazing. I love cooking and hearing her sing. Just beautiful. Looking forward to buying more cds!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Either you're a Vince Flynn fan or you're not.  If you're like me, a fan, you'll love this book.  If you really don't like Vince Flynn, you'll probably find something more to your liking in the romance section.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|This album takes a few listens to really get into it, but I felt the same way about Born This Way. Once you start to listen, the songs just get stuck in your head. I absolutely love it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I Play this game all the time and it is awesome all my friends play this game to they love install it people you will love not a waste of time trust me!!!!!!!!
B004XISI4A|5.0|Part of me is in a panic, because there are no more books yet... But the other part of me is excited because there will be eventually... The only problem I have now is how to fill in the time between now and then.<br /><br />George RR, your writing is deliciously addictive... And please don't kill off the Dwarf (or I'll take back all my positive reviews!!! ;)
B00122MBVQ|5.0|Let me just say first that I own this album on vinyl. This remaster is the closest thing available in the digital medium. The first release of this on cd was awful. The first generations of tape to digital transfers were sketchy at best. The same goes with this record. In the original cd version, the highs are way too pronounced while the bass is almost totally compromised not to mention it sounds lifeless compared to the vinyl and is pretty quiet. The engineers must have recognized that and boosted the rhythm section for this one because it sounds WAY better and also made it louder without compromising the sound quality. Not only that but the entire sound itself is more balanced and it is a far cry from some of the putrid remasters that have been done over the years to classic works. Overall I would say that this album is a great buy and it is my personal favorite record from this band. The songs really come to life with this remaster and the bonus tracks are quite spectacular as well. I honestly enjoy the alternate version of Burning Down the House as much as the final version. This is a must have for any Talking Heads fan!
B00005JKDR|5.0|After &#34;Toy Story,&#34; this movie is my favorite of Pixar's work.  The animation is absolutely wonderful, especially so when you watch it on Blu-Ray.  This is a movie that is good for kids and adults alike, though some little kids might be a bit spooked in places.<br /><br />This is the story of Mike and Sulley, good friends who live in Monsteropolis, a place somewhere adjacent to our own reality where everyone is a &#34;monster&#34; and they power their world via obtaining children's screams.  Hence, Sulley is a master scarer and Mike is his handler for the city's power company.  Sulley steps through doors into various children's bedrooms, scares them, and the power of their fear provides energy that they can use.<br /><br />The problem all starts when a little girl happens to tag along and follow Sulley back home...and, horror of horrors, everyone there believes that children are toxic to monsters.  There is also a secret plot going on at the power company involving finding another more powerful way of getting energy from the kids.  Sulley and Mike soon discover that not only aren't kids dangerous, but Sulley ends up attached with the one he ends up protecting.<br /><br />Wonderful movie.  The animation of Sulley's fur and the little girl's face is fabulous, as is one of the scenes where they jump through the interdimensional doors all over the world.  Very touching and very funny at times.  I've watched them movie half a dozen times and I still love it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this is as accurate as the weather can be! and it works great on the kindle! 5 stars cause I like the color scheme.
0385537131|3.0|I'm a huge fan of John Grisham but this novel just doesn't stand up to his best work.  I'd have to put in a category with Bleachers, Playing for Pizza and An Innocent Man which I also considered to be sub Grisham.
B004P1JEXE|5.0|So So Very Very Very Good... The Dialogue is sensational (is it wrong to like the bad guys just as much as the good guys?) and the twists and turns will keep you on the edge of your seat (and boy he is never scared of killing off a character or two.. even three!) but at the end you are still left screaming... GIVE ME MORE!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was a bit skeptical at first because I usually don't go for this type of stories.  But let me say that I was pleasantly surprised with this incredible book.  It was full of twists and surprises and always kept me wanting to know what was going to happen.  What a suspense, I thoroughly enjoyed it and can't wait to start the next one.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Up-to-snuff quality to fit in with the Angry Birds franchise.  New birds with new abilities make for awesome new challenges!  It is so well executed that it feels more like an original game versus add-on content.  Sounds and visuals are all top shelf!  What was it, 99 cents?  After you play the first set, you'll admit to yourself that you would have paid more.  It's that good.
B005H5H3LW|2.0|Movie was ok but it doesn't work in my player anymore.  I played it once and now nothing.  I wonder what happened to it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Can't get enough of the challenges. Hate having to wait 24 hours between quests and there not being an option on the mobile app to continue playing when only 1 or two moves to advance.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Fun game. I especially like the lots of crafting. all in all it is a very addictive game. Definitely worth a try.
B002C949KE|4.0|If you are interested in marketing or finding the reason people react to something and never read this kind of psychology book before, this is a good one to start with

B000N2HCKQ|4.0|It is easy to understand. There are a lot of example to explain each concepts in the books. Personally, I like the first half of the book because the contents make sense and understandable by itself.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|Ok movie with some easy to predict plot twists.  Great special effects but you need more than that to make a good movie.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is the Best of the 'Hungry Shark' Games!  Don't waste your memory space or time on the others. This one is IT!
B004UID2LC|1.0|What a crying shame of an app !!! My God, go back to the drawing board, IF you can do that!! Trying to save videos:  half are saved as one single freeze-frame, the others that DO happen to load are choppy and extremely blurry. Horrible!!! Not my phone either. Downloaded same video w/same quality pic with the higher, better rated app on Amazon shortly afterwards and am very pleased. I would have voted minus stars on this one if I could have.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|J.J. Abrams took a risk in this movie, and it paid off. Though Abrams created an alternate universe in his first movie- Kirk was born in space instead of Iowa and Vulcan was destroyed- this film feels much more like the original series than any of the other renditions of the show, though there are certainly modern twists. In the original series, Kirk, Spock and the other crew members of the Enterprise find themselves dealing with moral issues that parallel their space adventures. Abrams has recaptured this.<br /><br />The notions of wrong and right are tested largely in this film, which gives it more depth and more substance than if it were just a movie about some guys in space. Kirk deals with what is right versus what is regulation, as does Spock, and every moral struggle in the movie is overshadowed by the completely amoral Khan.<br /><br />This new Khan is not much like his predecessor; not only is Benedict Cumberbatch not a Latino playing an Indian, his portrayal of Khan is not that of the philosopher, the righteous man that has been led astray like the character was thirty years ago. Cumberbatch's Khan is ruthless, guiltless and completely impossible not to fall in love with. He is portrayed in such a way that you can't help but fall in love with his savagery. You know he has to lose, but you almost don't want him to.<br /><br />Because you have such a strangely sympathetic villain, Kirk's internal struggle is highlighted; does he believe Khan? Does he betray Starfleet in order to do the right thing? Abrams has done a wonderful job giving his movie ethical undertones that make it weightier. Gone are the cheesy &#34;this is what we learned this episode&#34; sentiments. There's sharp humor, love, adventure and action and underneath it all is the struggle to understand what is right.<br /><br />Highly recommend it, even if you don't like Abrams' recreation or the new actors playing timeless character. It can be watched for what it is; a new version of a classic show.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book for the second time ! I can't wait to go and see the movie now !!
1612930425|4.0|I chose to read Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen, to do a book report for my eighth grade English class.  I had heard good things about this book from friends who had read it, and wanted to read this classic for myself.<br /><br />Pride and Prejudice was definitely one of the most challenging books I have read on my own up to this point in my life.  It required a considerable amount of time and focus to fully comprehend the text.  Books published in the early nineteenth-century are often hard to read, and Pride and Prejudice is no exception.  The older-English writing style, difficult vocabulary, and alternate spellings of words all added to some frustration I experienced as I read.<br /><br />With my petty negative thoughts on the book out, I will move on to things I enjoyed about Pride and Prejudice.  Though the way we go about “courting” love interests these days is very different from the early 1800’s, basic themes have always applied in love.  Jane and Elizabeth (the eldest Bennet daughters) face a rollercoaster of emotions and confusion in their searches for love, like many of us in modern times do as well.  Jane and Elizabeth chose their love interests wisely, while their younger sisters, Lydia and Kitty, just want to be in love.  The middle Bennet girl, Mary, is scarcely mentioned throughout the story and appears to have no desire to be married-off, as is their mother’s greatest wish.<br /><br />Every Bennet girl, I am sure, could be easily adapted to modern times if this story were to be re-written in a modern setting, because some things just never change.<br /><br />Two of the main themes of the book, pride and prejudice (as you may have guessed), are also themes that humans have always, and maybe always will face.  Surely we have all felt that we are too good to be associated with someone; we are too proud.  And certainly we have all judged someone before truly getting to know them.<br /><br />Pride, prejudice, and everything love are the timeless themes in Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice.  Though this was a difficult book, I felt like it was rewarding when I had finished.  I would recommend it to everyone who is willing to slow down and really think about this great, classic novel.
B00BC254I8|3.0|Got to know Mike Tyson as the animal and as the human being. A bit too long and repetitive and at times cliche. A must read for boxing fans and for addicts that think there is no hope.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|...good job guys!! Damn, STILL trying to recover from the grave let-down of the \\"free youtube  downloader\\" by MicroMacro. This app is VERY good quality and really delivers as far as performance enhancement. A definite go!! Thanks again!! ;D
B00E00OGE2|4.0|The story really kicks in once Theo/Turbo leaves the garden and hits the road. I actually thought this movie had more for adults than kids - some of the jokes/puns really go over a kid's head, but to an adult they're awesome. The real surprise for me was how good/addictive the soundtrack was (including a lesser-known song by the Jackson 5) - they stuck in my head, so much so I later downloaded some of the songs.
B003L77GRO|5.0|I really got hooked with his series. I have number 7 * 8 but haven't seen them yet. Waiting for winter storms !!
B003G4W49C|5.0|A quick, fun read about a brilliant youth in a cold and hostile environment.  Suggestion: read the book, skip the movie.
B00F5F0208|5.0|Excellent album.. I love every song  I recommend anyone to buy .. not as much rap .. but more singing which is what I prefer..
B0043WDK2G|5.0|This series is very entertaining. The interaction between Beckett and Castle is great. Especially loved the episode where Castle spoke the Chinese line from Firefly.
B002ZG99TA|2.0|I will not keep this movie either. This wasn't a very good story or plot !!! Will not keep it..
0451228375|3.0|I was terribly disappointed with this book.  After reading Follett's first one I expected the same quality of writing from him.  His vivid descriptions of sexual abuse were not neccessary, and haunted me for days after.  This showed me that a man wrote this book.  Leaving a subject matter like rape to the reader's imagination, is quite sufficient.  We don't need it spelled out for us, literally!
B00F35BV64|5.0|Sequels rarely live up to the &#34;original&#34; but I think this one did. I have enjoyed most of the Star Trek series so i am probably biased, but I think this one still lived up to its original purpose. Good story, well played.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Grisham's latest takes us back to the setting of A Time to Kill in 1980's Mississippi.  Finely crafted characters and plot deliver another compelling tale that is hard to put down.
B00D3LA5WG|4.0|I enjoyed his movie ,but it wasn't one of the better ones he has made. I would re watch it!
0307887448|5.0|very cool book.  If you grew up in the 80s with atari, D&D, and other nerd greatness, this is for you.
0812550706|1.0|I will admit that when I first read this novel in 1993, I enjoyed it.  It appealed to the adolescent in me who desired to be strong and important, a hero, much the same way that the Harry Potter series appeals to young people.  After rereading this novel as an adult, I am actually repulsed by the glorification of violence, particularly at the hands of children.  I had a similar reaction to the Hunger Games. The novel is well-written and interesting.  It is a fine work of storytelling, but I believe that the underlying values perpetuate and justify a culture of violence that I do not want to pass on to my children.  The later books in the series are more reflective on the use of violence and the escalation to genocide; however, taken as a series, the first novel and all of the works written after the original four make this series one I would not recommend to parents or anyone who is concerned about violence.

B009IU6BIS|5.0|A Classic that I grew up with... National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation has been on every holiday season since I was about 8 years old; and even today I use it to mark the beginning of the season- It's not Christmas time until Christmas Vacation has been on!<br /><br />My wife, several years younger than I; doesn't give this movie a fair chance and tries to write it off as being somewhat trashy.  It really is not; instead it is real life situations, along with a string of misfortunes, to torment a true family man who wants nothing more than to give his whole family a warm beautiful joyous Christmas.<br /><br />Another plus to this particular title is that you do not need to be a fan / follower of the other National Lampoon's Vacation movies... Not only do the Griswald's not travel anywhere like they do in the others... Someone with no idea who Clark, Ellen, Rusty, or Audrey Griswald are can sit down and fall in love with the family right away.  And- while this movie did sneak out just before the 80's ended (1989), it does have a much more modern look than the other Vacation movies, and the casting of the kids was spot-on; as I always related well to the Russ of this movie, but did not to the others.<br /><br />Anyways...  Watch it, watch it a few times this holiday season.  If by some chance you have a wife or girlfriend who doesn't know the film, 'tis the season to be Merry!<br /><br />Side Note--- My name is Michael, but thanks to this movie my Dad has often called me &#34;Russ&#34; shouting out things like &#34;Settle down Russ&#34; though-out the years; in reference to this movie.<br /><br />If you watch this movie and are disappointed, well, I wouldn't be more surprised than.... &#34;if I woke up tomorrow morning with my head sewn to the carpet&#34;.
B008602KQI|3.0|The story could've been better.  The movie, however, was nicely done.  Another one of those books that the story line was weak but the movie made it more interesting.

B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I bought this game for my son, yet find myself playing it. The graphics are very cute, lots to do to keep you busy. The only downfall in my opinion is having to buy crowns, but I feel this way about every game that requires a purchase to move forward faster or get a certain item. Overall, very fun game for all ages.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Cop'd and I'm still rocking this album. This is the Eminem we all know and love. I've listened to all his albums and I've loved them all. This is the best one in a minute. Rap God, YES YOU ARE!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Allegiant is a disappointing ending to a series that has been awesome up until this book. I didn't really like anything about the final book. It took what could have been an interesting situation and did nothing with it.  I could have forgiven that if the ending had at least been good. I wanted to like it but can't. I won't say I hate it because the first two books were great.
B008JFUPFI|3.0|I was a bit disappointed in this movie! a lot of action ,but no plot ! Didn't like it at all. Not recommended !

B000XUBFE2|5.0|I bought this because I saw a preview of the movie. The story was great and well written. I would recommend it to anyone. Very touching story of a young girl and her foster family during a rough time in history. Can't wait to see the movie version.
B00E5Q1HJS|2.0|I'm a Trekkie. I like Trek and I enjoy the universe of Star Trek. I loved the first movie reboot, but this one . . . Once I realized exactly what it was I was more than slightly disappointed. A lot of it is stolen from the original (&#34;I never watched the original&#34; really JJ) And it is hard for me to stomach the unoriginal material. Still, if you are a fan, you have to watch it . . . with your bottle of tums. WHY JJ WHY

B0063GORYU|5.0|Because I really like to game.  Once you learn it, it is easy to play as long as you can make a move.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I don't consider myself a feminist so I wasn't sure how I would like this book. I really related to a lot of the things she said. I'm a young professional and I've been too intimidated to sit at the table.  I doubt my successes and feel like a fraud at times. It was so interesting and refreshing to hear about similar feelings from a successful woman. I also liked that she doesn't discount stay at home moms but talks about making choices that make you and your family most happy.  I recommend this for both men and women. It might help men better understand some of the challenges facing women.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was taken on a wild ride. Unexpected plot twists. I was unable to put it down. Suzanne Collins is an amazing story teller. This book will not disappoint.
B0077ATSSQ|2.0|This movie was very boring. didn't like it at all. Will not keep for my collection.  Very .long and boring!!!
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|As an aerobatic pilot and psychiatrist, I was very impressed by how well both the flying, and the depression, possible PTSD and above all, substance abuse, are handled.  Being a huge fan of Denzel, I was a bit sad to see him once again play the fallen hero, and I wonder about his repeated interest in playing heroic figures who have had to grapple with alcoholism.  I hope it's not a personal problem for him, but he does undergo the transformation from fit, larger than life men of thought and action, as he also did so well in &#34;Courage Under Fire&#34;, into slack jawed, sagging, slouching, defeated shells of their former selves, their power sapped by their addiction.  This is a bittersweet movie at best, but it faces the problem head on, with gritty realism.  No easy landings here, but as pilots say, &#34;any landing you can walk away from is a good one...&#34;
B001VIMCW4|4.0|Enjoyed this movie very much.  We were going out to see a movie and realized theire were two movies before that one, so we rented both of them to watch before we saw the third.

B00GH4R95C|2.0|I was very glad when this was over. And so very happy I didn't buy the video and only rented it through Amazon Prime. All the right Stars, but the story was convoluted. Too much going back and forth. It got very boring. Good for going to sleep by.

B00FAPF5U0|3.0|it is addictive,  I have decided not to play anymore since I am doing nothing else.  It is also frustrating.
B00GOQ9M4O|5.0|I liked the idea of the Governor protecting the little girl.  It seems like he has a chance at humanity again as long as the girl is alive.  He's been such a rat in the past that I would like to see him get some redemption.  It would make me feel better about his character.
B00AATV046|5.0|Best Christmas movie ever.  It's not Christmas till I've watched &#34;The Bishop's Wife&#34; every year.  Merry Christmas to all & to all a good night watching this wonderful movie.
B00AEFXN9G|5.0|Classical movie is an understatement.  As the extras show you, this was a dramatic encapsulation of a very complex issue involving southern California.  But it is beautifully done, with the layers peeling away, leaving more layers to discover.  Horrific end is so well handled.  Faye Dunaway and the other stars are magnificent in this movie.
B00B0LPYXG|3.0|Yes, even with three stars, the movie is worth watching for Denzel Washington's and Kelly Reilly's fantastic portrayals.  They are truly compelling characters that you cannot ignore.  But unfortunately, that is where this movie stops being great and becomes merely good.<br /><br />Flight is a movie that missed a great opportunity to explore a very important concept.  If you remember Vanishing Point with Barry Newman (1971), you remember a movie that dealt with a critical angst of a generation that was coming of age and felt that &#34;the rules&#34; (&#34;the man&#34;, &#34;the system&#34;) should be challenged...that older moralities no longer applied to a generation that was, quite frankly, too good for the system.  That was where I thought this movie was going.  But it got mired in a straight exposition of the ravages of addiction, in depressing detail, with no real message of hope other than you can end up in jail, but with real freedom in your soul.  Spare me.<br /><br />But it could have been great: there is this Barry Newman-esque character that can fly a plane better stoned and drunk then any other pilot flying sober and straight.  The maneuver Denzel's character makes to avoid a deadly crash cannot be duplicated by 10 other pilots in a simulator...they all crashed.  So this wonderful opportunity arises to deal with the true dilemma of whether &#34;the rules&#34; apply to someone who is so talented at what they do, that all the rules do is blunt the excellence with which he does his job.<br /><br />And all the pieces are there, because as Denzel's counterpart, Kelly Reilly is an addict with no special talent or abilities for whom &#34;the rules&#34; are a God send that when she embraces them, her life improves.<br /><br />Think what Zemeckis could have done with that.  And it wouldn't have to have been resolved in order to be a great movie.  Zemeckis could have left us with the unanswered question that survived in Vanishing Point (and A Thousand Clowns - 1965 - for some of us older movie buffs):  is conformity to a norm always good?<br /><br />Instead we are treated to a somewhat pedestrian examination of the deconstruction of a personality, not by drugs and alcohol, but rather by the system that attempts to force Denzel's character into Step One (admit you have a problem).  In the climactic NTSB panel interview of Denzel's character, the investigator admits that what he did saved people's lives, that the crash was a mechanical failure rather than pilot error; and in fact, the pilot was talented and heroic.  But yet there is this pedantic, jack booted march to the inevitable point where Denzel's character admits he flew under the influence of drugs and alcohol even though everyone admits this was not the issue at all.  In fact, if you watch carefully, it is only because he would have to falsely accuse his flight attendant lover of drinking on the job (she died in the crash, so this is truly an altruistic thing he is doing) that Denzel's character admits to drinking and taking drugs.  Did he really see himself as an alcoholic?  Or did he say that because he was so beaten down by the system that it was the only way to actually get the system off his back?<br /><br />And is this really the point of the whole movie?- for some of us older movie buffs):  is conformity to a norm always good?<br /><br />Instead we are treated to a somewhat pedestrian examination of the deconstruction of a personality, not by drugs and alcohol, but rather by the system that attempts to force Denzel's character into Step One (admit you have a problem).

B003O86FMW|5.0|This book may seem a bit overwhelming with the pages, but the cliff hangers keep you going. The ending will surprise you and the games go by pretty quick. The book does start off really slow and depressing but it gets better on. I would highly recommend this book if you are teenager because I don't know how an adult might react to this.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|The first book of Gillian Flynn, Sharp Objects is greatness, as prose,plotting and theme as one with the mystery-road of life she walks us down;down, as in dark and inducing compulsive page turning.<br />Her next two books up the ante, but this is certainly an amazing first book;the next two(Dark Places,Gone Girl), showing her to be no one and done author-if she next authors a phonebook I want to read it!
0857939424|5.0|This book on the plain packaging of cigarettes (packs that are standardized without appealing shapes, designs, colors or logos), focuses on the present legal disputes regarding tobacco packaging.  Though some of the chapters deal with specific countries, most notably Australia, the book provides a general context for many of the international legal issues that arise with a uniquely deadly product like tobacco. The three introductory chapters provide a general introduction to packaging and labeling as a tobacco issue, the tobacco control context of the World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), and the adoption of standardized packaging in Australia, the first in the world. The remaining seven chapters are written by nine legal authorities and scholars who detail the constitutional, intellectual property, World Trade Organization (WTO), international investment, and trade and regulatory law aspects of the current standardized packaging issues.<br /><br />Because national and international legal matters are technical, some of the chapters are demanding for those without much background in public health law. Yet, viewed from the generally understood context of Big Tobacco’s strategies of issue framing, lobbying, corrupting evidence and harassment, these chapters explain a great deal about why the tobacco industry has put huge resources into trying to stop standardized packaging and extend international agreements that limit controls on their products. Supra-national mechanisms like investor-state decision making which undermines national legal frameworks may be difficult to grasp outside a specific threat like uncontrolled tobacco use, but luckily this book provides enough context that the importance to common public interests is evident.<br /><br />It has long been understood that laws are like cobwebs that catch small creatures, but let bigger creatures go free.  The tobacco industry weaves webs of deception through which it has knowingly killed millions of people prematurely. Yet, certain opposing nets of accountability in law are not so easily escaped, and efforts to frame legal agreements to escape accountability is so painfully visible in this account of public health law, that even big creatures like corporate giants are unable to avoid exposure and restraint. To this end, this timely book exposes the necessity of an unrelenting commitment to stop obscure legal details from becoming institutionalized injustices that threaten sustainable development, environmental protection, and public health policy.
1476734941|5.0|I decided to buy this book after watching the BBC show. The science behind the Two Day fast holds lots of promise in the fight against ageing.  The program is simple to follow but not always easy, but when you see and feel your body change a little hunger is well worth the rewards.  Besides you are free to eat the next day. Am looking forward to having better health if not more years as I age. In my opinion this book will help everyone who embrace's it do just that.
006202406X|1.0|I wanted to like this so bad, but it just didn't work out that way. I LOVED Divergent so much I couldn't put it down. Insurgent was good too and it had an ending that left me thirsty for more. My thirst was definitely not quenched by Allegiant. The ending for me was too abrupt and trying too hard to be philosophical. Tris and Four were dynamite in the first two books but in Allegiant they lost that spark. They became new characters. A couple of times throughout my reading, I questioned whether I should reread insurgent to get a better feel of Allegiant. It was that all over the place. I am highly disappointed because the first two books were amazing and I was looking forward to the last in the trilogy. I don't even want to watch the movies now. I'll be getting bad anxiety knowing what Tris's and Four's fates are. I want to cry. This was poor writing, lacking creativity, and it destroyed my favorite characters. What. The. Heck.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The game is addictive. Some levels are easy, some seem impossible. You keep coming back. It is heavily tied to Face Book if you want to advance to high levels.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's the best the only thing I don't like it is that you can't change your skin<br />But besides that it's the best game ever!!!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book. I have read it twice now! I can't wait for the movie!!  What a great series.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone. liked the history and descriptions of bow each county handled the situation. Will read again.
1401938906|5.0|This is one of the best eye opening books I have read! It makes you more aware of how connected we are to everyone and everything.
B00F30S0Y0|3.0|I was expecting an album as great at The Suburbs, if that were possible.  When I first played this album, I thought I must have bought the wrong one.  I am hoping it will grow on me with more than one listening, as The Suburbs did, and that I will later regret my 3-star rating.  I admit that I am not a fan of hip-hop or disco or whatever genre many of the tracks on this seem to be channeling.  Caveat emptor--listen to some of the tracks (on Amazon.com) first.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Rodriguez produced the greatest two albums I never knew, so I'll give him the moniker &#34;Detroit's Dylan.&#34; You might translate that as the &#34;Motor City Bobby Zimmerman&#34; if you're one who knew Dylan when he grew up on The Range of Northern Minnesota. My only guess as to why these works were not giant successes in America is the extensive use of orchestration on the sound tracks. Today it sounds terrific, like Queen would have done; in the 1960s it wasn't the norm.<br /><br />Oh! If you haven't seen the movie &#34;Searching for Sugar Man&#34; then you MUST see that great American story ... brought to you via South Africa. It's the story of the long-overdue discovery of this great music.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Excellent!! What it sucks is that only the first season is available for free (amazon prime). Once you've hooked, you're basically forced to pay to watch other seasons.
B00632HWOG|5.0|The first time I updated this on my tablet it didn't work and was really frustrating so I took it off and reloaded on my tablet a few times and same thing. Anyways I waited a couple of weeks to update on my tablet but instead of using google I used amazon and it now works fine. Don't know if it was the site or the bugs finally got fixed.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this series.  Sadly I didn't like the ones that followed.  I haven't read the series that discusses the outcome yet.  I'm thinking about it and probably eventually will.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Excellent telling of a epic American story brought to you via South Africa. This isn't just the American Dream, it's the American Ideal. One man that deserved to make it big was passed over. When rediscovered decades later he enjoys his moments of fame than returns to the non-descript life of the working man. This movie finds that talent, the humility, and the greatness of man. You'll never forget it.
B00CT2P6VA|3.0|If you need help you have to buy coins and I have trouble getting through that process. Otherwise it is challenging and fun.
0385537131|4.0|It was a little better than Okay but it was not up to his former books.  Simply a good bridge from his first book.
B00ENBTI8C|4.0|I enjoyed the movie based on history but I would have to be careful because it's not for underage viewers. It gave me a better insight of the intensity on lives that was lived and how intense humanity can impact its end to power and for freedom. In history Romans wanted the world for pure power but eventually subsided after this event in history occurred. I really enjoy this movie.

B001TH44VY|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies!!!  I was unfamiliar with the urban tale of Antonio SalIeri causing Mozart's death (or at least that's what he thought supposidly) so it was fun and interesting to watch.<br /><br />The movie starts out with Salieri, as an old man, trying to commit suicide.  Having been committed to an insane asylum (very creepy), he confesses to a priest the story of his and Mozart's ugly rivalry.  Later on, I read many historical documents that while there was animosity between the two, supposidly Salieri instructed Mozart's son on several kinds of musical instruments and he accompanied Mozart on a performance of &#34;The Magic Flute&#34;.<br /><br />The acting, costumes, scenery are absolutely magical.  I've never seen anything like it - it was so lavish.  I believe F. Murray Abraham won an Oscar for his performance and Tom Hulce (as Mozart) was nominated as well.  The movie went on to win more Oscars including Best Picture/Best Director (1984).<br /><br />Mozart's glorious music performed by Sir Neville Mariner's St Martin-of-the-Fields symphony is truly inspiring.  Those unfamiliar with his music will be entranced as it is played throughout the entire movie.  The ending scene....I won't give it away but if you don't get choked up, well perhaps you don't have a heart.  One piece (Mozart's Lacrimosa from his Requiem) was a piece I taught my own church choir.  They learned it by watching the movie. Sung in Latin, it won't matter if one understands the text or not, he/she will get the meaning of the piece.<br /><br />As a music teacher, every year I played parts of the movie for my students (it has to be cleaned up some) and the students LOVE it.  Please watch it - even if you're not a classical music love, you will LOVE this movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Because I love how it keeps me wanting to come back for more and its challenging. I try to out do my friends.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It is addicting.  It is fun.  The game is colorful.  BUT I don't like the way the free game controls how often I can play.  At a certain level, it told me to wait 48 hours!!!!!  Unless of course I was willing to pay!!!
B0064NTZQ2|4.0|I heard a lot about this film before I saw it.  It raised my expectations and that wasn't a good thing in this case.  The film is a slow boil thriller with sudden and brutal snapshots of gory violence, both exploitative while still remaining grounded, and allows star Ryan Gosling's character &#34;the driver&#34; to mull about quietly and unnervingly a woman and child whose husband/daddy is in jail.  His character is less enigmatic than an enigma.  He's an anti-hero cast in the mold of Clint Eastwood's the man with no name drifter.<br /><br />Solid support is given by the remainder of the cast especially Albert Brooks playing against type as a Mafioso.  Bryan Cranston, the &#34;Breaking Bad&#34; man who is popping up everywhere these days, plays the been-around-the-block touchstone for all of the characters to tie around; the limp is his affectation and limitation, letting us know that he's learned his lessons the hard way but also that he can't quite leave completely the life that doles them out.  Carey Mulligan plays the lady in need of saving, and while her attraction to the driver is palpable the film plays coy and never lets us know how far they've taken their relationship to with each other.<br /><br />&#34;Drive&#34; will stay with you for awhile.  It's quiet will drive into your memory and its stark unfolding and unflinching violence will make you wince and want to forget.  But don't expect a cinematic epiphany.  3.75 stars.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Things like &#34;I couldn't put it down&#34; are an understatement. I stayed up all night until I finished. I had to know what happened.<br />I read &#34;Catching Fire&#34; & this book &#34;Mockingjay&#34; in three days. I thought all the hype about the movie was just publicity. So after seeing the movie by chance, I had to read the books. This book finally concludes Katniss' story, she finally gets her closure. It's not a fairytale ending, it's as real and human as the rest of the story. And yes there are lessons still to be learned from this book. So read and enjoy.
B00ARN0XGG|1.0|There is nothing scary here. I would be very mad if I paid good money to see it. It's like someone drops a book on the floor when your back is turned. Is that scary?
B00AHJL7BK|4.0|The app works well. Has good interface, large boards, and no real privacy issues. My one compliant is that the hardest level is still relatively easy.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Only 4 starts because although I just loan these characters for a short while and they belong to Veronica Roth, I still have an emotional connection to them...and I don't like it when they get messed with lol.  But it was a nice way to end the series and not back away from hard choices like so many YA authors do.<br /><br />I will say I wished that what was beyond the wall was more exciting, but like I said, I just rent these characters in my head for a while. I don't own them
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|If I could rate it six stars I would it is so much fun I play so much it is my best game on my kindle like to up grade my guns. It a fun game and I think that if you like hunting you would like this game.YOU HAVE TO GET IT!!!!!!!
B005IQ39AY|5.0|Its fun to play as an adult but it is simple enough for children to play. I usually give my kindle to one of my nieces when they are bored at my childless home and it works.
B00729GQ0A|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book - I go through a phase of reading fantasy and this was highly interesting and original. A bit slow at the start, but kept you interested until it all started to go haywire - in a good way! Can't wait for the next one
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|Great old movie! We all watch ,have a big fun. price can be ,less. but o well! we will wait ,lower prices and order many more!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|The reason that I love dystopian novels is the idea that amazing, unbelievable, out-of-this world events can occur.  This is why I fell in love with the Divergent series.  It’s set in a world that I can comprehend, but in a time far away.  It has characters that are complex, but relatable.  It was truly a wonderful experience to follow Tris through her world.  To literally lose track of time.  The best part of any trilogy is the fact that, as a reader, you can continue to experience the world that the characters live in even after the first part of their story ends.  I hate when a story ends and you have to say goodbye to the characters.  This is why I was so excited that shortly after I discovered the first book in the series (and promptly devoured it…as well as the second) I learned of the third.  Now, I waited to purchase Allegiant until I knew I would have time to devote to it.  I knew if it was anything like the first two, I would be reading nonstop to the end.  I spent two days of stolen moments with Tris, Tobias and all the new developments of the world outside the fence.  There were periods of heart-pounding (and I do mean that literally, chapters 48&49) excitement, but also too much time spent on tertiary, one dimensional characters.  I think I can agree with other reviewers when they say that the back and forth narration was a bit confusing.  In the first two novels Tris and Tobias had such distinct voices, this one fell short.  I had a hard time distinguishing them and neither character grew past what I had already experienced.  In fact, in my opinion, Tobias took a huge step back and Tris finally succeeded in becoming a martyr.<br />I read recently that Veronica Roth felt that the death of Tris was a natural progression of the character; she had escaped death so many times before, she could not do it again.  I have to respectfully disagree.  The reason dystopian stories are so wonderful is that the impossible is possible! After the chapter where Trisgets shot, I continued on in disbelief, comforted by the fact that she would be alright, she would find Tobias again, and they would survive the tyranny they worked so hard to overcome.  Imagine my utter disappointment when she actually dies…I was devastated.  She escaped the Death Serum, something no other character, apparently, could do…and then dies because she is shot…lame. Perhaps my expectations were too high or misplaced.  I can say for sure that I was truly disappointed at the end of what could have been a great story.
0385537131|5.0|Twenty five years ago, the initial print run of John Grisham's first novel, A Time to Kill, was 5000 copies. His second novel propelled him onto the bestseller lists - where every subsequent novel has landed.<br /><br /> In his latest novel, Sycamore Row, Grisham takes us back to Clanton, Mississippi and his first character - 'street lawyer' Jake Brigance. Three years ago, in 1985, Jake successfully defended a black man accused of murder - the murder of the white rapists of his ten year old daughter. The trial and verdict divided the town and racial tension still runs high.<br /><br /> I was waiting for just the right time to crack the spine of Sycamore Row. (Figuratively speaking of course because I would never hurt a book.  ;)<br /> I just knew that once I started, I wouldn't want to put it down. And I was right - I was hooked from the opening lines....<br /><br /> &#34;They found Seth Hubbard in the general area where he had promised to be, though not exactly in the condition expected. He was at the end of a rope, six feet off the ground and twisting slightly in the wind.&#34;<br /><br /> It turns out that reclusive Seth was extremely wealthy. And that he changed his will in the days before his death. His new handwritten will lands in the office of Jake Brigance, delivered by mail the day after Seth's death.  Hubbard has cut out his children and left the bulk of his estate to his housekeeper of three years - a black woman named Lettie Lang. Jake doesn't know Seth Hubbard but is determined to follow Seth's instructions to the letter of the law.<br /><br /> By doing so, he's in for another fight....<br /><br /> Oh man! I loved it, loved it, loved it!!! Nobody does legal thrillers like Grisham. Really, you don't even need the 'legal' qualifier. Grisham is pure and simple, one heck of a storyteller. Absolutely one of the best.  His prose flow seamlessly, drawing the reader ever deeper into the story and the town of Clanton. I could picture myself sitting at the diner, with Dell pouring coffee, and listening to the latest gossip.<br /><br /> The characters are really well drawn. Jake is extremely likable, principled and the kind of lawyer you'd want in your corner. I also quite enjoy the other supporting legal players - drunken, but canny Lucien Wilbanks, the pronouncements of Harry Rex and the astuteness of Sheriff Ozzie Walls.<br /><br /> Grisham brings his setting to life - the town, culture, attitudes and more are all detailed and benefit greatly from the author's own past. The legal machinations employed are just as detailed (and interesting) Grisham both grew up in the South and practiced law in Mississippi.<br /><br /> The plotting is excellent, the tension palpable and the journey to the final pages and reveal is oh so good. Absolutely addictive reading, Stick this one in your own stocking - five stars for sure!, with Dell pouring coffee, and listening to the latest gossip.<br /><br /> The characters are really well drawn.

B009ZZDNT6|3.0|.First thing I did was upgraded the  alarm and clock. Now it keeps reverting back to the non upgraded version. I have to reset it and reset all my personal alarms. So it works good, when it works.
B008S7EPXA|5.0|AMAZING! Best album in years!!! Dead Can Dance never fail to impress. I've been a fan for years and this is one of their best albums yet.
B00BTZN91C|4.0|Great music. This band keeps getting better. I really like how they incorporate drums into their music and this release incorporates primal drums as part of the theme.
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|it is perfect and arrived on time, bad thing is I droped it and it got really damage so I had to reorder :(
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Almost put it down many times persevered and it was only ok.<br /><br />Ok if stuck on a plane for hours.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|This album is great a must have.Did'nt skip one song.One of the best rock albums  I've heard in a longtime highly recommended
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I like this app.  I really like that I get to select from my music.  The only thing I don't like at this point is I can't put off an alarm.  What I mean is, if I realize I'm not going to be getting up at the usual 6:45 on Monday this week (which I only do one morning a week), I have to cancel that alarm.  Then reset for next week.  It creates a risk of forgetting to reset, plus I have to reselect my music....  I'd like to be able cancel once, not the whole alarm.  Otherwise, it's serving me really well.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|The premise is great and plot is very interesting. Just Claire Danes character is over done, acting out to her superiors in ever scene or crying to them, breaking major laws with really no second thought to it etc. Would be a lot better of her personality quirks were a bit more subtle.<br /><br />Still fun to watch though.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|i liked the pace of the book.  there were many characters to be witness to and care about.  as a reader, i was hoping he would end up with her and she would end up with him but this book was not wrapped in a bow.  it's messy like life must have been for slaves, slave owners and people who fell in between.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|As usual, another great novel by Baldacci.  Great story line and a real page turner.  Only drawback is that it's VERY hard to put down once you start it.
1476712042|5.0|i absoultely love this book, could not put it down!!! I have reread it multiple times, Jamie McGuire rocks :)
0062082353|5.0|This was a satisfying overview of the life of an American sniper. Most of its pages are devoted to Chris Kyle's experiences as a SEAL sniper in Iraq. But the book is also a legitimate autobiography. Kyle summarizes his life prior to the U.S. Navy. He also tells about aspects of his life in the Navy besides being a sniper. And he summarizes his life after the Navy, from 2009 to 2011. But my 2012 Harper Collins hardcover edition has no information about Kyle's death in 2013. For that you can search Wikipedia for Chris Kyle.<br /><br />Most of us live without opportunities to perform heroic acts. Yet we can do them vicariously thanks to books like this. It is more than suitable reading for the common Joe, or Jane. Sensitive parents, however, should be cautioned that their children's eyes will behold the f-word. I, for one, would allow anyone who can read this book to read it. I disagree with much that Kyle says, but I commend him for saying it. It is after all HIS story.<br /><br />Photos and map are considerately provided, but no index. The map of Iraq is satisfactory, though I would rather it were two-pages, so it could include ALL places noted in the text. Kyle's narration is saturated with anecdotes, including many of combat. He also offers expert tidbits about his profession. And his words are interspersed with italicized first-hand accounts written by his wife, Taya. That was a good idea. He gets a bit too opinionated during the last pages, but these pages are too few to be concerned about. Toward the end, my loyal attention was rewarded by some fine penmanship. It has to do with Ryan's story. A superb, well-planned composition that I shall NOT spoil by giving details.<br /><br />I have not read much about the SEALs, only a few books. But they're enough to make me think that if I need a fresh synonym for \\"hero,\\" I might try their acronym.

B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|Malala's story is captivating, inspiring and eye-opening in many ways.  I'm giving it four stars because I got the feeling of grown-ups getting a little girl to speak their political stances.  Malala's story is touching, and the book leaves you wishing you could sit down with her and talk heart to heart, without the interpretation of a Westerner.  I feel like her story would speak for itself and the average Western reader would be able to connect to her story without to effort to make it accessible.  The artificial accessibility dumbs it down a little bit, or removes the emotion and makes it into a cause.  It's still a must-read because it's still a story to be heard, no matter how it's told.  Pick it up if you want to learn a lot, come to appreciate most things you take for granted (especially if you're a woman) and get that warm and fuzzy feeling this strong teenaged girl inspires.
B00ABLJ5NQ|2.0|I read this because the Booklist review said it was a &#34;novel for adults&#34;, but it seems to stand a better chance with younger readers. I found the mysticism too jarring to get sucked in to the story.
B002MG2ATY|4.0|I like this movie and it a lot of twists and turns and you really get a sense of a lot of conspiracies going on.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I love the graphics of the game and it is so awesome I hope they I they put new maps, weapons, game modes and customize weapons color.
B0077EBWVI|4.0|It's a fun movie to watch. A lot of music and dancing.  I like Julianne Hough's part but as far as the other actors ~ even though they did a good job ~ they were not as good as the actors in the old movie.  It would be hard to replace Kevin Bacon as well as pastor and wife.  There were parts of the new movie that I think were better (such as his uncle's supportiveness).  It was a good movie but you can't help but compare it to the old one.
B00CO4GO7I|5.0|Just the final ending to an amazing story of an amazing Navy Seal from Texas.  Buried in the Texas National Cementary in Austin, with lots of our heroes from history!

B004UID2LC|3.0|its a okay app to use for you tube, kinda hard to use and main screen is a little weird,
B00992CF6W|5.0|My boys (age 6 & 8) absolutely love this game.  They have built so many houses, complete with furnished bedrooms.  I personally have never played it, and I have no interest in it, but they love to design new houses and work together on building it all out.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Normally, I have the end figured out about half way through which ever book I happen to be reading. In the Racketeer, I think I have it figured out, but I have my doubts if it will end the way I think. This, too me, makes for entertainment that is worthy of the read. If you are a Grisham fan, you'll like this book. I haven't read anything Grisham for years and I'm glad I decided to read this one.
1439190275|4.0|It's the start of a new you and this book gives the ins and outs of the low carb diet.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|great app for you tube and downloader and i use all the time for videos and music, easy to use too
B005HSL626|5.0|I just love this game for those times when I need a few minutes to do something that doesn't require me to engage my brain too much :)  It's entertaining and challenging enough to keep me saying &#34;just one more time&#34;...more than just once more.  One of my go-to games when I need a quick break.  My kids love it too!
B00BGI086Q|5.0|Great series with a lot of promise left for subsequent seasons. I'm really looking forward to the series as it develops.
B000RO9VJK|5.0|This is an awsome book!  It confirms everything I thought starting a business is all about, but of course he has it laid out so nicely. It is what most people miss, whether they look at starting a business or their thought of what business is. Thank you Michael E Gerber.
0345803485|5.0|Second time reading it. Read the all the books in 3 weeks and now because of all the hype about the movie i wanted to read them again. i gave the first ones i bought to my cousin and i had to buy them again, thanks god this time was for a cheaper price.
B00ENTDDGW|3.0|game is exactly as it appears in the image.  fun enough to pass a few minutes of time, but not the kind of game i will play more than a game or two at a time.
1416955070|5.0|City of bones has everything that I love vampires, werewolves, and gives it a twist that makes the creature better but still gives them that horror image. This book is nothing like twilight. The main character is strong and doesn't stand a side. Their is teen humor that adds to the book and the characters. Don't judge the book by its movie, their is more to it then what the movie is saying.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I've read all of john Grishams books. This is the one I did not want to end. I even waited an extra day to read the last chapter. Maybe the best Grisham.
B002XXUWMI|5.0|If The Matrix and The Adjustment Bureau had a baby it would be this film.<br />I missed seeing it during it's original release in 1998, but the film is by no means dated, so it's still worth watching.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is one of those games that has me hooked.  Some levels seem so easy, some seem so hard.  The concept is easy enough, but achieving the objective in the allowed number of moves can be difficult!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love historical novels.  This show shows changes that occur in the lives of family members over time.  It also shows the social issues that were important at the time.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|My son plays this app more than me but he really enjoys it. I can't get him to put down the kindle.
B004ZISVRW|4.0|It is a good &#34;found film&#34; sci-fi flic.<br />I thought a couple parts were weak, but all in all an enjoyable film.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Not a very good game. Not impressed with the controls. My kids and my husband didn't care for it either.
B0041D843M|5.0|This is an excellent study, sometimes too analytical but definitely puts into focus what one should and should not be eating on a daily basis.  I enjoyed the studies to prove their findings, and then found the fact that they reversed the studies to go back to the original findings quite frightening, but at the same time very positive.  I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in their own nutrition.  I think, as far as the layman is concerned, the shorter version of this book would be more practical.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|It was true to the original movies of each super star. It was exciting and well done also. I liked it a lot.
B0040I09RM|5.0|This is a fun, exciting series. I've watched all the seasons and will continue to. From a woman's point of view,  there are good looking men, testosterone and alpha males. I like the character of Jan Teller and his mom Gamma you will love to hate.  The brotherhood between the men in the club is well portrayed.  I'm torn on Jan's girlfriend Tara. Sometimes she is really good. ....but she whines too much. I would also like the series if there was something actually good that happens to the club and characters.  It's always putting out one fire after the other.  Something happy once in a while would be appreciated.  That said, I'll still continue to watch.
B00DWOUY3Y|5.0|Verdi's 200th birthday provided a good excuse for this boxed set of Metropolitan Opera performances that were broadcast live between 1935 and 1967.  These have appeared in other editions, most \\"unofficial,\\" though UN BALLO IN MASCHERA and OTELLO were in the Met's \\"historic broadcast\\" series on LP, issued for fund-raising purposes around 1980.  All but two of these had been run by Metropolitan Opera Radio on Sirius/XM prior to release of this set, and the AIDA was also heard in 2005 as an \\"archive\\" performance during the Saturday network radio broadcasts.<br /><br />The sound quality varies, and as might be expected the 1935 LA TRAVIATA requires the most indulgence from the listener.  The sound has been improved considerably from earlier copies, and while quite a bit of distortion from the source recording remains, noise and speed variation issues have been addressed.  Applause after arias has been truncated, possibly when the original transfer was made years ago from the acetate discs, but the defects are worth tolerating to hear Rosa Ponselle's Violetta, and Lawrence Tibbett when he was still in prime vocal condition.<br /><br />While sounding far better than the TRAVIATA, there's a small amount of distortion in the 1945 RIGOLETTO, 1949 FALSTAFF and 1959 MACBETH.  The RIGOLETTO seems an odd choice; the sound is a little dim and, as noted by the critics at the time, The Duke of Mantua was not one of Bjoerling's better roles from a dramatic standpoint.  But the voice is splendid, and Leonard Warren supplies plenty of drama.  It's also good to have an example of Cesare Sodero's competent conducting, since he was busy at the Met in the early 1940's, and his commercial recordings are not representative of his abilities, made when he worked as music director for the Edison phonograph company.<br /><br />The MACBETH, from the Met's first production of the work, invites comparison with the commercial recording RCA Victor made with the same cast.  The live performance has astrange acoustic, evidently not sourced from the microphones used for the broadcasts, providing more resonance than usual.  The frequency response is good and the voices are captured fairly well, but the orchestra sounds like it was in another room.  I'm guessing the microphones were above the stage, without a direct path to the orchestra pit.  Distortion levels aren't extreme, but do unfortunate things especially to Leonie Rysanek's voice.  While the voices and orchestra sound better in the commercial recording, it was made in the early days of stereo, emphasizing separation of the channels, distracting enough that playing it in monaural mode helps.  Even so, the balance between singers is better in the live performance.<br /><br />The two from 1940 are especially attractive, being fine performances with interesting casts, and the sound is quite good with low distortion and a surprising amount of dynamic range.  The OTELLO is very impressive, energetic and precisely executed by all forces under Ettore Panizza, with Martinelli's voice captured far better than it was in the studio-recorded excerpts he made at the same time for Victor.<br /><br />The sound quality is also fine on the rest of the performances, with the 1950 SIMON BOCCANEGRA and 1952 LA FORZA DEL DESTINO excellent for the time they were recorded, and having little surface noise from the discs.<br /><br />I have a couple minor gripes about the editing.  Scene and act changes happen without a break; I don't expect commentary by Milton Cross, but a few seconds of silence would have helped.  There is also no hint in the notes as to how these were presented in performance \\"at the Met\\" where RIGOLETTO and LA TRAVIATA were usually given in four acts.  In a couple places the applause has been truncated; it may make some sense at the end of a disc side, such as after the tenor aria in Act III of LA FORZA DEL DESTINO, but there isn't much excuse for dropping 30 seconds of it after \\"O patria mia\\" in the 1967 AIDA.  Fortunately this only seems to occur in a few places, so I don't consider it a major issue.<br /><br />The 136-page booklet has plot synopses of the operas and some information on events surrounding the performances, with the text in English, German and French, but very little technical detail on the recordings, other than for the 1935 LA TRAVIATA.  The cast lists and pictures are probably the most useful parts of it.<br /><br />Access to the discs is somewhat awkward, since they are in cardboard envelopes arranged as folders.  Squeezing the envelope open near the \\"spine\\" of the folder usually allows the disc to drop out far enough to grab the center hole, and the cut-out on the edge is an improvement over the similar packaging of the Wagner collection.  At least the box doesn't take up a lot of space, and the envelopes provide plenty of area for identifying the tracks on the discs.<br /><br />With ten operas in generally fine performances, this is an excellent release, a bargain at the price, and despite a few minor issues it is fully deserving of a 5-star \\"I love it\\" rating.
0783116934|5.0|Many important messages come through in this taught thriller. Great acting and sadly a true story.  Hats off to Mr. Rea and Mr. Whittaker.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This book was as entertaining as any fiction. McDougall has mastered the art of making nonfiction vibrant and lively.  Runners of all kinds can appreciate his account of his experiences. By the end I wanted to run like the Tarahumara!
B00FLNQBTK|5.0|My favorite comedy of 2013 so far and I doubt I'll see another one as good, let alone better this year.  I saw this movie in the theater and it is LOL funny!!!!! I purchased it the day it was available on Amazon Instant Video. GREAT COMEDY!!!!!
0893860468|5.0|direct perception of a reality that cannot be described.<br />my only complaint: The text is sprinkled with hindu yoga terms in sanskrit.<br />NM's knowledge is not of the scriptural variety, and the sanskrit robs the statements of their ontological immediacy.
B009BJAZBA|5.0|Enjoyed having access to this series.  Quality TV is scarce and to know that it is being archived is a good thing. Thanks
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved how the story continued!! Steven kept right in line with how Danny turned out. Loved revisiting the whole family.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|The studio should never be under estimated in it's role to creating the sound.  I thought this was a great documentary about one of the all time great studios Sound City.  Lots of appearances by the stars and great background information on how some of the top albums of the 70's were recorded.  Also went into the appearance and competition of digital vs analog and it's effect both on Artists and their records.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|The first one was the most interesting, followed by the second.  But this one did wrap it all up so that you understood the whole context.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I liked the fact that Jake Brigance was in this novel and that it mentioned many times the previous book that he was in.  It made me able to picture the setting, especially since I had seen the movie with Matthew McCaunahey as Jake Brigance and and Ashley Judd as his wife. (probably misspelled his name) It seemed for awhile that  this trial was going to mirror the trial in his previous book but I kept reading and am I glad I did.  It had a very good ending that tied the whole thing altogether.  I really liked this book.
B00BEF1AEK|2.0|Weird game - I could not get past the purple tongue and I didn't really find the sling process very accurate.  I uninstalled after a few games.  Tried this on my Kindle Gen 1.
0062225790|5.0|For those who admire and have read Dr. Dawkins through the years, this is a must read!  Once again, written with brilliance and humor!  Richard Dawkins states that his greatest scientist is Charles Darwin.  My greatest scientist is Richard Dawkins for he has set me free from the fear of the myth of religion, he has truly set me free and has conveyed to me a reference level of knowledge of the marvel of life!
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|Terrible movie.  Didn't even finish it!  I was very disappointed in the movie and would not recommend it to anyone.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Seriously.  This book seems to have &#34;changed my life.&#34;  It sounds so silly to say that, but it actually describes what happened.  I was already overweight, with high triglycerides, poor cholesterol balance and increasingly high glucose (a few  annual checks just under 125 and one reading over.  Two successive &#34;overs&#34; would have gotten me the type-2 diabetic diagnosis.  So, I thought I would give it a try.  Glucose has come down to a normal, managable range (I started checking it myself weekly) and weight has dropped significantly - from just over 200 to 180-ish.  Consider a wheat-free future.
B00FOWX6NM|5.0|Case is very thin and does not increase the size of the phone in my opinion. The 4 corners are clearly designed to take the impact should this fall, while slightly elevating the phone to protect the screen if placed on a surface. My only negative comment would be that I wish the tpu was a tad more tacky, but the way it is currently designed I would recommend to those seeking a minimal case. Also, this color looks good with the gold phone.<br />The screen protector is smooth as glass,but is a finger print/smudge magnet. You will be wiping the screen throughout the day with this protector. But it came free with the case so I am appreciative of spigen and the package they offer.
B0007TKNII|5.0|I've seen the musical many times in several cities, including the current Broadway production. This is a terrific production. The Phantom is performed brilliantly, with an effort to sing the role as a disturbed psychopath might sound if he actually sang.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Good story of SEALs makes me respect the special forces a lot more. It's a great fast read. Especially finding out what he did with the proceeds. RIP Chris Kyle, Thank you for your story, and most importantly Thank you for your Sacrifice for this AWESOME NATION.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|Action packed, great story line!  Kids loved it and can't wait for a sequel.  Buy it watch it and then watch it again.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|This stays in my truck and even with regular use I only have to charge the case with the headset in it about once a week. Thursday is my charge day - I bring in this and my fitbit and charge everything up. The case is good quality and holds a charge for a long time and multiple toppings of the headset.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Well done presentation of SciFi themes and conflicts from the vantage point of Ender Wiggins.  If you like this sort of book, get it!  If you're more into action and adventure, then look elsewhere.
B00G32TD98|5.0|One of the best, if not the best horror movie I've ever seen!! I love Lorraine Warren. I hope she helps create more movies like this one.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|One of my all time favourite movies, though a bit dated these days. Still, it's a wonderful procession of two people through a series of tumultuous years. Watching Alda and Burstyn play different ages and stages is a treat.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|I liked this book, sure, but I still feel like the plot could have been more fleshed out. Spoilers - I knew exactly who Kalden was. It was pretty obvious. And the plot points were pretty weak, but I said that already. Also - does every book HAVE to be a cliffhanger? I think this book and whatever sequels Mr. Eggers puts out probably could have been shortened and made into one book.
B008OJ291W|5.0|Great to hear fresh approach to these old classics. Smooth and true to the original recordings the Jeff Lyne way
B009AJDDQU|3.0|It was a bit juvenile in it's treatment of the subject matter, but pretty good special effects.  Cost to watch was too high considering you can buy the DVD at Target for $2 less and actually own the movie.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I love it -  learning a different language can be difficult but Duolingo makes fun. I can take it with me on iPod and Kindle Fire.
B001O6W9QC|5.0|I dislike Ben Stiller but I loved this movie. Stay for the end. Interestingly, this is also the only Tom Cruise movie that I like.<br /><br />Jack Black and Danny McBride were great. Robert Downey Jr. is LEGENDARY.
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|For those with the update issue, uninstalling from device and reinstalling worked for me without losing progress. I was really hoping that this update would include Facebook link capabilities, but no such luck.<br />With the new update, there are now mystery and calendar functions, which seem to be cool concepts. Unfortunately, I've logged in for 48 consecutive days according to the opening screen, but the calendar isn't showing the past three days. I know there were several issues with the game over the weekend so hopefully this is fixed soon.<br />The game can be glitchy- sometimes it gets out of sync, or your friends disappear, or you have to harvest crops you already harvested. However none of these issues has ever caused me to lose coins, RC, or anything other than having to redo a few things.<br />The game has good graphics and the missions are fun. I haven't had to spend any real money and I am at level 27. I overall love this game, although adding Facebook and fixing the glitches would be an awesome improvement worthy of five stars.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|This book was good, but it was all build up and very little finish. I'm actually a big fan of books that don't end like you think they will, or should, but it was like the author just got tired of the book and decided to quit writing. I loved that we got to see a little more of Hana's character, though!
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Loved reading from the man's point of view!  A great read.  Could not put it down!  Will certainly look for other books by this author!
B00GMONG90|5.0|This CD is the best thing ever! I can't believe more people don't know about this group. They are amazing. Check them out on youtube. You will not be disappointed!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Game is fun, but annoying when u r timed out and have to wait 30 min or more to continue.  If I want to play longer, that should be my choice, not the game's decision. Rated 3 stars for this reason.
B00005JPSM|5.0|Wow!  This is heart wrenching at times (just like real life!), yet beautiful how grief and sadness is transformed in time as relationships are forged into a new family!  I watch this several times a year!  It's emotional, yet has very happy moments in it as well.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars is one of the finest books I have read in sometime.  Beautifully written with strong, well-drawn characters.  This book manages to be both poignant and joyful.  Not to mention, exceptionally funny.
B00B4804KS|5.0|I'm pretty sure most people know the storyline of the movie so I won't get into that. But the 3D....WOW, this should be a reference for how all post converted movies should be made 3D. I was wary of buying this since I already have the DVD, but I was looking to expand my 3D collection and thought 3D dino's would be neat to see. I am very happy I purchased this and believe it is probably the best bluray 3D film I've seen to date.
B008YRVW0I|4.0|Great Game however ,Graphics are too small for the screen?It needs to be BIGGER and fill out the whole screen?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush Saga<br />It is a fun game, although I don't always make the right moves. There is more to learn about it however.
B00AR83PN4|1.0|Could not use the instructions to play it.  I did not understand the instructions at all and I am proficient at reading and comprehension.
B00D7NWTSI|4.0|I liked this movie, however it's not without its faults. I won't get into my opinion of the storyline, since that's hotly debated all over the internet and would bring up spoilers, but I will review the 3D. I was not very impressed with the 3D aspect of the film. It added some depth to the movie, but lacks any real WOW moments from a 3D point of view.
B00ESB6GBY|1.0|This season is such a cop-out and a pathetic ending to a great run. They have completely forgotten their characters, particularly the character of Robin and what's the deal with Marshall, did the actor have too many other commitments?  The best episodes are the one centered around &#34;the mother&#34;. At least she is an interesting character with some apparent depth, rather than a mere caricature.
B003G4W49C|5.0|The characters & the plot are so rich. Such intricate, insightful messages to ponder in the themes.  Great read for many.
1449382673|5.0|A very easy style of writing makes this a breeze to read. You start writing actual code in Python from the first chapter. If you want the basics of Python (and a little more) then this is the place to start. If you have never programmed in any programming language before this and are thinking Python is a good language to begin with, you are correct. It's a fully functional language and, frankly, the simplest to write and understand. As of this review, the College of Southern Nevada uses Python ( and Raptor, a free flowchart tool created by the USAF) to teach introductory programming. As a student in that class, I have found this book invaluable. The actual textbook for the class, Prelude to Programming: Concepts and Design 5th Edition, is a great book to learn basic non-language-specific (generic programming vocabulary) programming ideas.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|My son likes angry birds so this one is a winner with him as well thanks Amazon the graphics are also great
B008LXZFH6|1.0|It's Cheesy funny! I liked it but not worth much more that that. My son liked it but I suffered through it .
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Great game. Addictive. You will love this game, once you start, you can't stop! Try it for yourself and you will see.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved it it was amazing!! One of the best books I have ever read!!! Everyone should read it at least once if not more!!!
B00G9QLP9Y|2.0|Unless you just want to look at the neighborhood and not get directions to a specific house, you might like it. Seems rather useless because you can't ask for directions.
1932100660|5.0|An excellent book - groundbreaking.  I was stunned that more people aren't embracing this, until I tried going vegan, and realized that people cling to their animal products almost as tightly as they cling to their faith.  So I've gone vegan myself, at least as often as I can, and if I can bend an ear on an open-minded individual, I do what I can.  It's a remarkably simple notion that makes perfect sense once you're done, but there's quite a bit of research that backs that up here as well. I'd recommend this to anyone.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally the kindle had this app available. What can I say I love candy crush..I'm addicted. I'm one happy camper.
B0059QJ2D6|4.0|After watching this fine movie for awhile, I couldn't expect any humor or an ending that was pleasing. I was right. But it really packed a punch at war, family conflicts, and two brothers who probably should have stayed away from each other as much as possible. It also showed how issues of violence will not only affect women, it will also have serious psychological effects on children. As in most Danish movies I've seen, the acting was superb. Judge for yourself.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I like this game way more then Farmville.  Love this game! Super addicting! I can't wait to keep building and find out what happens next.
B00DKY4LBW|5.0|I think this is their best album! You can tell they have grown up from their punk rock beginnings, although there are still references to that I'm this album, which I like. Very catchy songs, nothing too upbeat, just all around nice to listen to.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I played this on Facebook all the time and always had so much fun. I'm also very happy that I downloaded it for free, but received $1.10 for downloading the game. Great deal!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so addicting, it doesn't matter how frustrated I get with being stuck on a level. I can't stop playing it. And now that I can get it on my Kindle, I don't have to wait till I get home to continue playing.
B006ANJ4BW|3.0|as good as I expected. got be into Conan to even come close to enjoying the show.  acting was better than really thought it would be from the person playing Conan.  dont feel as if I wasted that portion of my life as some some movies make me feel.  go into expecting a medium budget fantasy flick and watch some sword play.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Sky Davis has lived her life pleasing her mother and gaining a reputation. Sky meets Dean Holder and he entices her and scares her and makes her feels things never before felt. Sky tries to fight the feelings for Dean but he keeps coming back and soon its inevitable to fight. When Sky learns things from Dean's past her whole world shatters. That's not all...Sky starts learning things and it is enough to break her.<br /><br />Colleen Does it again! I was all like Aww! then What an Ass! then Aww! then WTF! OMG! then right back to Aww! Yes I felt all of those things in the span of this book! I just love when a book grabs you by the front of your shirt and wont let you go...This is a trait every avid book reader looks for and Colleen Hoover definitely has it in her writings. So I must say go out and buy this book now you will not regret it.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I absolutely love Rick Riordans novels. They have a little bit of everything in them, especially little bits of humor here and there
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|great.1 hour from opening package 2 tablets, and laptop are up and running,set up 1 and the rest almost do themselves on there own!!!.
B007RE0SCW|5.0|This is the only version of Clawdeen I like. I love her character it's just that most of the time I find her clothes to be too garish. This beautiful doll fits in perfectly with the other 17 in my collection. At first I didn't like that there was no stand for her but I like how she looks without one.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|After seeing the movie I was curious to see how the book would compare. I've learned that the books are usually 100x better than the movies and that was the case! I was slightly disappointed with the movie after reading the book and seeing how much was changed. The book was lovely- though a fairly quick read- It's been 3 days and i've read the three books following, it's an enthralling series. Whimsical in a way, and very twisted.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you like temple run and subway surfer then u will LOVE this game. I instantly became addicted. This game is so so fun! Two words GET IT!!!
1250038820|5.0|Brandon Stanton captures a great deal of the diversity of the humanity of New York against the backdrop of many diverse settings.  Humans of New York is a fascinating story in so few words.
B00DONMG0M|1.0|MUCH smaller than I expected. I was very disappointed. But, it is still very cute, so I use it as a decoration on my shelf.
B00EUUJID6|5.0|The quality of their voices, as usual, never fells to be impressive. Buy the cd and you will understand what I am saying is true.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Fun and realistic . Different quest to do and different animals to hunt in the whole game. For me the best game that I have downloaded
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Got it for our grandson who come to visit for the week end every month and they just love playing it.  Nothing wrong with it and seems like a great game...and especially for free!  Thank You
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I m having fun playing this game. I first it was not doing what I wanted then I caught on.<br />Loving it.<br />bj
B000SVZIGC|3.0|Story line not complete but the parts that were done were done well; except the parts of Rasputin. His character is far from historically accurate.
B00FAI2IUM|4.0|A fun racing game so far, but it made me hold my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 upside down.  And thus the steering controls are backwards.  I'll try rotation locking my Fire in the desired orientation (you know, with the camera at the top), but I shouldn't have to do that.
B003UYUQZW|4.0|The Sands of Time...good movie...didn't have any problems with it that we know of it was a gift for our grandsons and they didn't mention anything wrong with it
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|I am doing this rating for my daughter who absolutely loves the vampire diaries! We were so happy to find this in your library.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|I love the game but a lot of the pieces do not fit like they are supposed to. It gets annoying when you have a gap or a bump on the board.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|Great story and characters. Dialogue sharp and witty. Creative narrative descriptions. Makes you want to be apart of the story yourself. Buying the rest of the books in the saga.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Love Kay Scarpetta as a character. She is smart, strong, and mostly in control. I like that she also has flaws that make her relatable. I read most of Patricia Cornwell's books. This one is worth your time.
B00FOWX6NM|5.0|The case is everything the description said it was... I love it ! Nice clear back. Easy to install !
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I am not a gamer, but as a child I enjoyed puzzles. For me, Rooms takes me back to those days of solving puzzles. I become so absorbed that I lose track of time.
1593275080|3.0|This is a beautiful book with gorgeous photos depicting fantastic creations, but how I wish it were available in hard cover!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Tried other cleaner type apps and this one is much superior to the others. Very easy to use. Very satisfied.
B003F3FJQO|3.0|Better explained events than the first book but plot twists kept occurring and got to be too crazy for my taste. Ending seemed out of place, however, overall the book didn't leave me unhappy.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|The focus of this book was off for me.  It felt scattered and inconsistent.  I was a big fan of the first book but felt like the trilogy lost its magic with the final installment.
031623480X|5.0|Great book with some great ideas about the cause of brain deterioration and other illnesses that are lifestyle choices,  Now the hard part, putting what I learned into practice.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I am a senior that doesn't like to always wear my glasses, so this ap is perfect for me.  I only need basic calculations and can see and use this calculator perfectly.  I am sure it does many things that I don't need, so it would work well for others that need more extensive calculations.  Really like it.
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|I have never seen anything so beautiful, so artistic, so creative and so breath-taking.  I really love this DVD.  In fact, I play it all the time.  The artistic ability of the artists and their performances remind me of how much we underestimate the human potential.  The artists and the performers on this DVD defy what we generally think of as human possibility.  In addition, the music is entertaining, and the cinematography is a testimony to the brilliance of James Cameron.  If someone is looking for a normal Hollywood story, this is not the DVD.  However, if someone wants to step into a world filled with the highest level of artistic expression, this is the DVD for you.
B000A158TM|4.0|Great example of anime. Definitely worth watching. At this point it might be hard to find on this format, but it would be a worthwhile addition to any video collection.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Fits my new kindle perfectly. It is not only beautiful, it makes it comfortable and easy to hold. I Love it.
B00GI8AMI8|5.0|See all the great reviews and had to see for myself..My first point and click game I completed..you know I am soup...had got frustrated at first so I decided to go at it again..took notes since there is no journal and got it will play this again..looking forward to the next game
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I loved this series.but I hated the ending. I think it would ended just fine without adding in the last depressing part. Ruined it for me.
B00E34A9FU|5.0|This is the best live recording of the Dead I've ever heard!! This event was captured when they were at their peak. A 30 minute dark star alone makes this worth the price--the rest is icing on the cake--a must have for anyone's collection -not just the dead heads
B003B02O0A|5.0|Intriguing book. Kept you wondering what the lawyer was going to do next. Also wondering about the safety of his loved ones.
B00DT99BX6|4.0|At first glance, you'd think this was one of many romance novels that line bookstore shelves. We start with a rebellious heroine with a sterling pedigree who meets a mysterious stranger in exotic locales. But what sets this novel apart is that it also incorporates elements of suspense, action, and thrills, giving it near-universal appeal. And that's saying a lot, because I don't normally read romances, but I can say I was fairly impressed with this one.<br /><br />Our main character, Camille, comes from a well-to-do family. Unfortunately for her, an incident from her past has made her widower father all the more overprotective of Camille. Camille eludes her bodyguards and tries to live some semblance of the dolce vita, but this quickly gets her into trouble. While vacationing in Turkey she is attacked by would-be kidnappers. Thankfully, a mysterious stranger comes to her rescue. She soon becomes infatuated with him, but as their paths continue to cross, Camille begins to learn more about him - and her past - and that spells danger for everyone involved.<br /><br />The book introduces an innovative feature called &#34;Sights and Sounds.&#34; It adds a multimedia dimension to the ebook experience by including context hyperlinks to external media into the text of the book. I, for one, appreciated this avant garde element. The ebook is still a relatively new medium and the author's ingenuity pushes the envelope. For those of you who may be skeptical, you needn't worry - nothing is lost by forgoing the hyperlinks. All the hyperlinks do is add an optional richer dimension - i.e., sights and sounds, bells and whistles - to an otherwise solid reading experience. My only gripe is that the instances where this feature actually came into play were few and far between.<br /><br />That aside, &#34;Pawn of Innocence&#34; is a good, quick read with universal appeal. Regardless of what you look for in a book, this book's got a little bit of everything, and you won't be disappointed.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|Good graphics, nice gameplay and plot. My only problems were that it takes up a lot of space on my kindle and wastes battery pretty fast. If you can, can you find a way to fix it? Other than that, loved it!
B00B89WXYS|5.0|One Republic continues to put out some of the most amazing music. Native is their best yet, all the songs are fantastic.
B003VS0CXS|4.0|I love this movie and bought a cooy for my young niece and nephew to introduce them to this wonderful classic musical.
0061537969|4.0|I don't usually read &#34;regular&#34; fiction without fantastic elements but this book was suggested to me by a friend who had just heard about my dying dog AND it was on audio so it was much easier to get through.<br /><br />It started off kinda cheesy and I thought the dog narrator thing was gimmicky. I was thinking about giving up, but not too far in, it got dark. The racing as a metaphor for life sequences started to grow on me and I started to really care about this guy. Being in a slightly precarious financial situation myself (between divorce and foreclosure) I found that the story actually was changing my moods, making me anxious or worried about the main character.<br /><br />The writing was great. I felt for the characters. The characters were real. I don't know if the book actually taught me anything but it was enjoyable and a nice change of pace.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This game is so fun!! U can do anything with it i just love it its so amazing!! :)  u should get this app its worth it!! :)
B003M696QS|5.0|This book was educational and interesting at the same time. Ideas and thoughts were backed up with scientific information, Connections to spiritual and historical thoughts were convincingly  presented.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|I have to keep buying new copies of this movie because I keep giving mine away. It's just that good.
B0044WUIHA|5.0|This movie has every element necessary to be called a classic.  It is well written, superbly acted, the direction and production are impeccable and even now, more than ten years after release it is a mesmerizing experience.  It was recently a choice I made for family movie night and it generated more discussion and thoughtful speculation than any other movie we ever watched.  My 13 year old enjoyed it and my 16 year old daughter couldn't stop asking questions.  My response was always &#34;Sit.  Watch.  Wait.  Let the movie carry you.&#34;.
0446310786|4.0|The print is small but it is a good book; I don't care to own much fiction but this is one I'm glad to add to my library.
B00E9A656K|5.0|My little sister plays it all the time she can not put it down so i have to take the game from her.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|This is the best Bond film since Goldfinger.  I missed Sean Connery for all these years and frankly never took to any of the Bonds that followed him.  Until now.  Craig brings a whole different interpretation to the role and that makes the franchise fresh.  The references to an aging agent in this movie were great fun for me and the plot was paced well.  Judy Dench is wonderful and I think I'll miss her in the Bonds to come, but so glad to know Craig is working on another.
B0063IH60K|1.0|I don't like this game and I can't delete it.  It's making me furious. It's just too easy to win.
0140177396|4.0|print is s bit small but it is a good classic to own. I did a critique of the book for my world Lit class
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|I used to play this game all the time and really enjoyed it. Unfortunately since the most recent upgrade, this game crashes in the middle of play and does not refund your game tokens which are required to play. I also have over 300 gifts from friends that I cannot redeem without crashing the whole app and this has been a &quot;known issue&quot; for over a month. I hope they can work out all the problems because I really liked this game before. I even considered upgrading to the paid version but due to the constant problems, I've changed my mind.  Also playing with friends has never worked for me, it just searches and searches and never finds the person you're trying to connect with.
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|I had heard this was fun and thinking with nostalgia of the weekend mornings I spent with Superman, I gave this a look.  Trouble is, it takes itself too seriously in places that should be fun and goes for laughs when it should be serious.  It's poorly paced and misguided in its scope.  I think three stars is generous actually. I'd give it two were it not for some favorite actors in the flick.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|A chaming story that leaves the viewer skeptical at first. The plot engages in surprising twists and turns and the ending left me so confused as to what happened that I had to check alternate sources for the answer.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This is an awesome app put when you get to one that you don't know it is hard then when you get it it is easier
B00E66QPCG|5.0|It explains in simple language how to chart stocks which have a potential to rise in value. Also gives names of good charting platforms.<br /><br />.
B001RMYWG8|5.0|Great story and acting. Pacino is at his best here and you really get a feel of NY in this story.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|One of the best shows I have ever seen on American TV. I like political and spy movies but this is way above those I have seen, primarily because of the level of acting especially from Claire Danes. I have always thought she was one of the best young actresses in the country but she has really outdone herself this time. The suspense throughout is very gripping and you can't wait to see the next episode. I just wish the cost was less especially for the next seasons, so more people who don't have Showtime can enjoy this compelling drama.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's fun to play and it keeps me in touch with friends and family who play it. It's a lot of fun.
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|I love Patricia Cornwell's books.  Amazon keeps me informed when books will be coming up and are always very helpful when<br />I have questions.  Thanks again.
B00932A4XE|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this movie!  It was funny and entertaining throughout. Great Jaylo and Cameron Diaz performances!  This is a great date night movie.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|What a great series.  If you have a Marine, or any branch veteran or military enthusiast in your life this is a great miniseries for them.  I work with a Marine who did two tours in Afghanistan and not only did he read the book but verified that Generation Kill was extremely accurate.  I really enjoyed this series when it aired on HBO and finally bought it recently.  I plan to watch it again over my holiday vacation.  Very well directed and portrayed by the cast.  The series did its homework and presented a lot of truth without overly glamorizing, watering down or otherwise distorting the story of these Marines.  Two thumbs up from me.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I like the music. The crowns are easy to lose and change needs to stay stored up. But all in all its fun
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This is a fascinating and complex story and one that was clearly written by Brandon Sanderson.  He clearly has a fascination with magic that is powered by some sort of physical/limited resource and which primarily enhances human abilities.  The characterization is fascinating and deep, and while at times I wanted to be reading about one of the other point of view characters, the diverse narratives really do weave together to tell a fascinating story and set of interlocked perspectives.  I'm looking forward to learning more, not just about the characters, but about the history of this world and about its future.  Really it is a wonderful start to a series.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Love this DVD. Jillian Michaels is a beast and makes you work your butt off. It is only 3 workouts for 30 days though so it can become a little boring.
0071373586|3.0|Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind<br /><br />Given that this was a required book for school Good book for the value
B00EJX2YGM|5.0|Love it!!! My last investment into Twilight Saga, definitely worth the money! Great packaging and delivery. Fans should really buy this one!
B00006F7S4|5.0|Beck's willing fall into melancholy is beautiful. His tightly nuanced sonics, haunting lyrics, and tasty hooks are no less potent on this release than his more celebrated, upbeat music; only his muse has changed.  I find that this music perfectly fills a periodic need when my own emotions run this way, as does Eno's ambient releases, giving me space to reflect, and a soundtrack which eases my own heaviness.
B00BAXFECK|3.0|An enjoyable story, with imaginative but believable characters. You will find yourself rooting for the protagonist. I was a bit put off by the author's tendency to rely a little too heavily on directly addressing the reader, especially in the final chapter.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|I want to love this app. I love the way it looks, but for some reason after working just fine for a couple months- it keeps crashing every time I try to watch a video. I've deleted and re-installed several times but it just keeps doing it.
B00E9PMMPI|5.0|great scifi movie very surprising how well this old movie transferred to blu ray and a great price great add to any blu ray collection
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|fun game and free...... if you keep it that way.  just don't want to have to post on facebook all the time
B00919CI5Q|5.0|Thoughts about the GTX 660:<br />-Its fast. Runs BF4 at Ultra/1600x900/60+fps. Arma III at Ultra/1600x900/45+fps (60+fps if you limit draw range).<br />-ShadowPlay is awesome. It can record gameplay with virtually no loss and auto records 1-10 minutes of your past gameplay so you never miss footage, ever.<br /><br />Thoughts about the ASUS DirectCUII Cooler:<br />-QUIET. I have a silent-focused rig with low-RPM fans and a passive CPU cooler. I can't hear this card on load. I actually took my side panel off to make sure the fans were spinning.<br />-Temps: 32c idle and 63c load<br />-The bracket support looks cool.<br /><br />TL;DR: If you're thinking about getting this, just hit the add to cart button already.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|I wasn't a huge fan. The main character is so detrimental to herself that it gets old. I felt depressed through out most of the book. Just my opinion. Neat concept with the flower meanings. I gave it 3 stars because in the end it was okay.
1400069289|5.0|very interesting and useful although nothing that you probably did not already know...but a good refresher course. Don't expect to learn much unless you have been blind.
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|Even though I paid for this app before it went free the app is really great, it actually runs much better than its older brother asphalt 7. Asphalt 7 crashed all the time but this time around it runs, looks, and has a much better feeling to it.
B00ES27W7K|4.0|I started this book months ago, and had to put it down and read lighter fun books in between, but after the 1/2 way mark of this book, I got really interested. In the end I could not put this book down. It was full of amazing connections that J K Rowling is so good at. It is sad, and I cried but I loved it. It made me think about the town and its characters and their lives. I only regret that I do not know anyone who has read this book and I have no one to talk to about it. I was a total fan of Harry Potter, and I was disappointed that this book was so different, but after putting my time into this book I ended up just glued to the pages. I was tempted to rate this with 5 stars, because I just loved the 2nd 1/2 so much, but the 1st half was so depressing and hard to read, that I could really only give it a 4 star rating. I look forward to more books from J K Rowling. I feel she is so very talented and has many more stories to tell. This book is not for everyone, but if you can make it through the first 1/2, you will not be disappointed by the end.
B000W8HC8I|5.0|Great fun book. Could not out it down.Cant wait to see the movie!<br />I was expecting a happy ending but enjoyed it nonetheless.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a pretty good game for passing time by! I recommend this one to anyone who just want to have simple fun.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I honestly don't understand all of the negative reviews of this app,  it's why I decided to write my own.  I got this as the free app of the day and it's absolutely the best photo editor I've ever used.  I got it for free but would gladly pay $5 for it.  Using this I've created the most beautiful photos and it's allowed me to fix pictures I had taken that had issues and needed to be fixed.  It has such a huge selection of filters and ways to transform your photos.<br />  I highly recommend this to anyone who takes lots of photos with thier phone. Honestly most of the people posting bad reviews all seem to be using kindles,  in that case it seems like it probably more of a device issue they're having and not a problem with the app. Trust me,  give this one a shot,  try the free version and if you like it get the paid one. The paid version offers a ton more options and is definitely worth it!
B001NHZ2KM|5.0|A classic movie of classic rock. This film captures the essence of the Who. Pete and Keith are hysterically clever. Roger demonstrates why good frontmen should never speak (but always have an open shirt). John, of course, remains largely unexplored. Brilliant film.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I really like this game. You don't have to purchase anything unless you just want to. It's a good way to kill a few minutes.
B000HKYBXA|5.0|Best Hamlet performance ever!  I use with my high school students and they love it!  It follows Shakespeare's language all the way through without skipping lines.  I look forward to owning Branagh's live Macbeth performance when it becomes available.
B00BAVCD8A|3.0|Packaging was sad but nothing wrong with the cd and the fact it came with the mp3 download was very cool.  What wasn't was how when I downloaded it came with the amazon cloud which just annoyed the hell out of me
B004FQX59I|5.0|Quite possibly the best documentary on the Kennedy assassination :-) I have heard many say that it is misleading and inaccurate in some areas, but I have never heard anyone offer a critique of specific facts. Nor do I recall any glaring errors from the film that differ from Jim Garrison's account. The film points out the absurdities of the Warren Report, which, apparently, is sketchy territory for some. For anyone who has read any of the Warren Report, however, absurdity is a given. Great film.
B00BEK6Z7M|4.0|Each year I look forward to the latest book release from two of my favorite authors Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child.  I found that this was truly a great read, a great plot and strong character development especially Corrie Swanson,  Corrie is a college student and a protegee of Agent Aloysius Pendergast, and has come to a wealthy Colorado ski resort to work on her graduate thesis based on perimortem analysis of skeletal remains.<br /><br />The story unfolds upon her arrival on investigating the death of several miners back in the late 1800's. According to folk lure and old records, these men all  had a horrible death, each clawed and eaten by a  rogue grizzle bear.  To expand the elite ski resort, the cemetery was excavated and contents moved to a temporary warehouse, waiting to be placed in a new area.<br /><br />As sheriff Morris gives Corrie a tour of this warehouse the mystery builds upon Corrie's examination of one of the skeletons.  She becomes suspicious as to cause of death - cannibalism?  The story continues with Corrie being arrested and placed in jail.  Many twists and turns await for you as you continue with this wonderful mystery.<br /><br />I rated this 4 starts because to me, it was not the authors best novel but never the less a wonderful read.
B00B4FU6KE|3.0|it didn't hold my attention. Some of it was a little far fetched....but it made for great conversation at my book club meeting!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game ever! You should totally get this game. You can build your own world. If I were you I would buy this game because you will have so much fun.<br /><br />  PS<br />  Do not add to many animals in your world because the server will freeze.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I think the game would be better if backflip studios added dino dragons, if any of you read this please contact backflip studios<br />But I love this game
B00AXOPK6W|5.0|Classic romance about the Dashwood sisters and their search for love. This novel is totally brilliant. I just love the drawings.
B00E7SXPVW|5.0|The original release is still the best but I like listening to the different mixes.  It's my favorite album of all time so I never get tired of hearing these songs.  The remaster is hardly different, which is good.  They kept the dynamics and &#34;brightened&#34; the sound a little.  And it's less harsh.  The new Albini mixes are interesting, at best.  This recording of sappy may be the best.  The instrumentals are fun.  The last 2 jams are nothing special.<br /><br />There's a click in the right channel just before the 1st verse on Heart Shaped Box that really bugs me.  It sounds clearly like a digital artifact and not part of the performance.  Out of the 3 versions of heart shaped box on these discs I think it's on 2.  The original release of course does not have the click.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Love the new update! The graphics are amazing and while it has the same thing over and over again, I never seem to get bored. I highly recommend this to anybody looking for a game to play when they're unoccupied.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|One of Grisham's Best!<br /><br />After A Time to Kill, I think this is Grisham's next best novel. Couldn't put it down. Great ending as well which ties together the entire plot.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Complex characters and a compelling plot. I hated to see the book end. Can't wait for the final installment in the Trilogy.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|this is very good as the story continues.  probably one of the best written, directed, and acted shows in the hx of TV.  it is great right to the riveting end.  Sad to see it go.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Its Wonderful, great for my old eyes!!  I am happy I downloaded it!  Perfect for quick need of basic math.
0393312836|5.0|257 Customer Review #806, very positive  19/11/2014<br /> A Clockwork Orange (Stanley Kubrick, 1971, 137')<br /><br />Directed, produced and written by Stanley Kubrick<br />Based on A Clockwork Orange  by Anthony Burgess<br />Starring Malcolm McDowell, Patrick Magee, Adrienne Corri, Miriam Karlin,<br />Music by Walter Carlos, Cinematography by John Alcott, Editing by Bill Butler.<br />Artwork of the now-iconic poster by Philip Castle, layout by designer Bill Gold.<br /><br />Anthony Burgess' 1962 novella A Clockwork Orange employs disturbing, violent images to comment on psychiatry, youth gangs, and other social, political, and economic subjects in a dystopian future Britain. The film's central moral question (as in many of Burgess' books) is the definition of &#34;goodness&#34; and whether it makes sense to use aversion therapy to stop immoral behaviour. A critical target is the behaviourism or &#34;behavioural psychology&#34; propounded by psychologists John B Watson and B F Skinner. Burgess disapproved of behaviourism, calling Skinner's book Beyond Freedom and Dignity (1971) &#34;one of the most dangerous books ever written&#34;.<br /><br />Kubrick fell by chance on the novel. &#34;I was excited by everything about it: The plot, the ideas, the characters, and, of course, the language. The story functions, of course, on several levels: Political, sociological, philosophical, and, what's most important, on a dreamlike psychological-symbolic level&#34;. Kubrick wrote a screenplay faithful to the novel, saying, &#34;I think whatever Burgess had to say about the story was said in the book, but I did invent a few useful narrative ideas and reshape some of the scenes&#34;. Kubrick based the script on the shortened US edition of the book, which missed the final chapter (restored in 1986). The film's Ludovico technique is widely perceived, however, as a parody of aversion therapy more than of classical or operant conditioning.<br /><br />Burgess reports in his autobiography You've Had Your Time (1990) that he and Kubrick at first enjoyed a good relationship, each holding similar philosophical and political views and each very interested in literature, cinema, music, and Napoleon Bonaparte. Burgess's 1974 novel Napoleon Symphony was dedicated to Kubrick. Their relationship soured when Kubrick left Burgess to defend the film from accusations of glorifying violence. A lapsed Catholic, Burgess tried many times to explain the Christian moral points of the story to outraged Christian organizations and to defend it against newspaper accusations that it supported fascist dogma. He also went to receive awards given to Kubrick on his behalf.<br /><br />Stanley Kubrick, writing in Saturday Review, described the film as: &#34;...A social satire dealing with the question of whether behavioural psychology and psychological conditioning are dangerous new weapons for a totalitarian government to use to impose vast controls on its citizens and turn them into little more than robots.&#34; Similarly, on the film production's call sheet Kubrick wrote: &#34;It is a story of the dubious redemption of a teenage delinquent by condition-reflex therapy. It is, at the same time, a running lecture on free-will.&#34; A Clockwork Orange was photographed mostly on location in metropolitan London and within quick access of Kubrick's then home in Barnett Lane, Elstree.<br /><br />The above text is a very shortened excerpt of four slightly edited paragraphs of the original Wikipedia text. I have concentrated on Burgess and Kubrick, who were two extraordinary people, and on the main format. The full review runs over many pages, and also discusses some of the useless, but at the time (I was around when the film first came out) extremely heated lengthy debate about censorship. I found it very indicative at the time that governments, which, through the police, are the executors of censorship everywhere, were very touchy on the subject and mostly unhappy that “pornography” (of which there is hardly any by today’s standards) was their only handle for intervention: They would all have preferred to ban the movie altogether for subversiveness – like Eastern Europe would have done/did, but that was out for the free and liberal West…<br /><br />257 - A Clockwork Orange (Stanley Kubrick, 1971, 137') -Customer Review #806, very positive - 19/11/2014phy” (of which there is hardly any by today’s standards) was their only handle for intervention: They would all have preferred to ban the movie altogether for subversiveness – like Eastern Europe would have done/did, but that was out for the free and liberal West…<br /><br />257 - A Clockwork Orange (Stanley Kubrick, 1971, 137') -Customer Review #806, very positive - 19/11/2014
B00846REIS|5.0|Finally, finally, finalllyyyy!  I've been waiting for this my turn to read this from Overdrive.com and it finally came! I did even get to enjoy this book for the full two weeks I'm allowed to keep it, grrrr. Then after I realize I was finally able to check it out, The Missionary popped  in the library, too! Wtf, lol.  So anyways... Onto my review.<br /><br />This might've been the best, or very close to the best, romance novel I've ever read in my life.  I couldn't put it down!  Oh em geeee Gideon is sooo sexy.  No- he's not hot, he's not cute, he's not pretty, he's not beautiful- he is downright, drop dead, makes me blush and tickle my girly parts SEXY.  There's no getting around it.  So obviously the cover of this book is very close to FSOG.  But from everyone raving about the similarities between the two series, I don't see it!  When I think of FSOG I think BDSM automatically.  Gideon explained to Eva about his dominance and her submissiveness in this story but there was never any contracts, rules, or any of the sort that comes along with a battered dom like in most books.  He didn't meet her and think, &#34;She's gonna be my next sub.&#34; No, he freakin LOVED her... She wasn't just a sex toy that he could beat on and screw whenever he wanted to.<br /><br />I was somewhat leery going into this read hoping that it wasn't an exact replica of FSOG like I was told it was.  Sure, they have some common traits but don't all romance novels?  I've been in a major book slump (I know, I know- I say that all the time) and this totally pulled me out and now I'm hungover. Ughhh. The worst part of reading an amazing book!  There was NO flaws for me.  Nope, none.  I always find flaws in some way or another.  With romance books flaws usually are: saying each other's names wayyyy too many times, immaturity (characters acting immaturely or speaking to each other like teenagers), the good ole common love story (boy meets girl, they fall in love, lots of sex, some small issue comesalong that's resolved quickly, happily ever after. The end.), repitive lines (saying the same thing over and over and over again to fill pages), totally predicting the whole book after reading a whole whopping 50 pages, etc. I could go on and on and on.<br /><br />I'm really curious as to what happened to Gideon in his past.  Obviously, he was abused.  That's a given... But I want the full story, the reason behind the nightmares, and most importantly- WHO DID IT?!  I fell in love with his sensitive side and found myself extremely jealous of Eva.  Like seriously  he worships the ground she walks on.  He would kiss her feet, suck her wounds, save her life, ANYTHING he could do for her he would do.  He LIVES and breathes for HER.  Everytime she ran away from him I wanted to scream at her!  He's a battered man with no previous experience with this sort of relationship!  Give him a flippin break here.  Everytime something occurs, she runs.  Ughhh I could've slapped her a few times.<br /><br />I don't think the sex scenes could get anymore intense!  Now FSOG made me hot and bothered just like this book did, but I'm not down with the BDSM, the abuse stuff and anal stuff.  Gideon and Eva had good ole fashioned vaginal and oral sex- VERY HOT sex, that is.  There was a little butt pleasure thrown in there but nothing crazy, thankfully.  & oh my goshhhh he ALWAYS made sure she got hers before he did.  What more could a woman want?<br /><br />All In all, if I could I'd give this book ten stars.  I loved it.  Definitely going on my all time favorite reads list, which means now I have to purchase the set and give them to my mom for Christmas bc she loved FSOG, too. :P. I can't wait to jump into the next book once my name comes up on the list again- which will probably be 6 months or so but oh well.  If you read this Mrs. Day, thank you SO much for writing such an outstanding book!  You are a fantabulous writer with a great deal of skill and talent.  I love you a little bit.  Lmao!
B006GWO5NE|3.0|There is nothing wrong with this product but it did not solve the solution for my kindle fire. The usb port was completely disconected from the motherboard and will not charge. Amazon WOULD not offer to fix this problem. They only wanted me to upgrade to a new kindle fire. NO!

B000059HB7|5.0|Rio Bravo (Howard Hawks, 1959, 141’)<br /><br />If ever there was need to prove that in the American Western movies, everything relates to everything else, and likewise, everybody, in  person or as type, then Rio Bravo could serve as perfect illustration! IMDb provides the shortest story summary, viz “A small-town sheriff in the American West enlists the help of a cripple, a drunk, and a young gunfighter in his efforts to hold in jail the brother of the local bad guy.”<br /><br />Howard Hawks’ script was written by routinier Jules Furthman and Leigh Brackett, based on a short story by B H McCampbell. The film is considered one of the masterpieces of American cinema. The movie stars John Wayne, Dean Martin, and Ricky Nelson, with Angie Dickinson, Walter Brennan, and Ward Bond. The film received favorable reviews, and was highly successful commercially.<br /><br />Rio Bravo is generally regarded as one of Hawks' best, and is notable for its scarcity of close-up shots. Only four appear in Rio Bravo. In the opening scene, wherein Joe shoots an unarmed man: Joe's revolver is shown in close-up, when he rolls a cigarette, when Dude pours a shot of whiskey back into the bottle; and a close-up of a beer glass where a drop of blood falls in, alerting Dude to a gunman in the bar waiting above him in ambush. The long opening scene has no dialogue.<br /><br />The musical score is by Dimitri Tiomkin. His score includes the hauntingly ominous &#34;El Deg&uuml;ello&#34; theme, which is heard several times. The Colorado character identifies the tune as &#34;The Cutthroat Song&#34;. The tune was used in the following year, over the opening credits of Wayne's film, The Alamo. Its composer Ennio Morricone recalled that director Sergio Leone asked him to write &#34;Dimitri Tiomkin music&#34; for A Fistful of Dollars.<br /><br />The film was made as a response to High Noon, which is sometimes thought to be an allegory for blacklisting in Hollywood, as well as a critique of McCarthyism. Wayne would later call High Noon &#34;un-American&#34; and say he did not regret helping run the writer, Carl Foreman, out of the country.

031623480X|5.0|Awesome book, it's great to hear about the latest research. I started off on eating healthy years ago and what use to be considered crazy is now proving to be true! This book is helping me make further adjustments to a already healthy lifestyle. Will recommend this to anyone i know.
B00CEF014E|5.0|If you're like me...when I read books I usually feel like I can figure out what will happen next. Well, not in this one! It's a fantastic read, written incredibly well and (once I gave in that I didn't know what was next) I could not wait to turn the page.  You literally get drawn into the story and it will trigger all your senses.  I don't want to give anything away because it's one of those great, rare reads you want to discuss with others to see if they felt the same.  Whew...loved it.  And, I know you will, too.

B00EY7LT9Q|3.0|Nothing new or spectacular about this show. With cable TV uping it's game network TV has to be more creative in its storytelling, dialogue, plot and character development. The special effects are above average and some of the jokes are funny but none of it made me want to tune in week after week. It's far better than another new &#34;sci-fi&#34; offering &#34;The Tomorrow People&#34; sooooo if you are a sci-fi/superhero junkie and need to choose between the two &#34;Agents...&#34; is the better of the pair-and again that's not saying a lot.<br /><br />But I'm a tough cookie. I need to be surprised and challenged as a viewer-if that doesn't happen then I move on where others may stay. There's something to be said about staples and familiarity, McDonald's is still in business and going strong and I haven't eaten there in years. But there is nothing wrong about a good cheap hamburger from time to time-Agents is your Big Mac/Quarter Pounder with cheese of TV. Bon Appetit!
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|Heard this got great reviews but didn't do too well in the theaters. What a shame, would have really enjoyed on the big screen. This is an epic film that I liked so much im going to purchase the Blu-ray and view again. Does not disappoint, rent, buy, view it and enjoy!

B00ELP1U6S|4.0|I first read The Beautiful and Damned when I was about fourteen, right after I had read my first Fitzgerald book, The Great Gatsby. And I was, of course, greatly disappointed; this is no Gatsby. I found the novel verbose and dull, and I couldn't relate at all to the two main characters, Anthony and Gloria Patch, a spineless rich boy married to a lazy, domineering, spoiled brat. They must surely be two of the least sympathetic characters in literary history.<br /><br />Reading this novel again, almost forty years later, I found much more to appreciate about it than I did at first reading, but I finished it with a heavy heart, fervently wishing that a talented editor had taken an entire box of blue pencils to the manuscript.<br /><br />One of the great literary achievements of \\"Gatsby\\" is its amazing economy of style; Fitzgerald stuffs an enormous amount of information into a very short book, without once leaving us feeling that something's been left out. (This is probably because Gatsby, alone among Fitzgerald's novels, began its literary life as a novella--a long short story--rather than as a novel. Fitzgerald literally pulled the original novella manuscript out of galley typesetting and expanded it into a novel.)<br /><br />\\"Economy of style\\" is a description you certainly can't apply to The Beautiful and the Damned; it meanders all over the place, and it employs a hokey and odd literary device by turning some of the dialogue into actual dramatic scenes from a play, rather than prose. This device might have worked if Fitzgerald had used it throughout the book, but he doesn't; he drops the dramatic scenes after the early chapters of the book, and never re-uses them again. That just makes those scenes stand out even more awkwardly amid the regular prose.<br /><br />The book also suffers very badly from the lack of sympathetic main characters. Of course, the whole point of the plot is that these people are awful, but we need **some** reason to keep reading their story. Again, if an editor had taken out his box of blue pencils, he might have noted on the manuscript that Anthony and (and especially) Gloria needed some kind of sympathetic counter-balance to their general, dual awfulness. Otherwise, why continue reading? There is a slight--very slight--sympathetic air attached to Anthony, whose main redeeming quality is his self-loathing; he knows he is awful and is ashamed of it, but is not strong enough to do anything about it. Gloria, on the other hand, has no clue that she is a greedy, incredibly selfish monster; she thinks her looks are the only thing she needs to offer up to the world in order to obtain all the \\"goodies\\" to which she feels entitled.<br /><br />Despite these major flaws, the book is still worth reading for Fitzgerald's matchless prose, some of the prescient philosophizing (he rightly predicts the death of poetry as a literary art form, and for the correct reason, too) and the richly drawn tertiary characters, such as Tana, the Japanese houseboy, and Dot, the tragic Southern camp follower who falls hopelessly in love with Anthony. There is also something to be gained at pondering the lives and personalities of the Patches and realizing that most of us, no matter how flawed we think we are, are much better people than they are..

B00EVW0SA0|1.0|Ok, where to begin.  Hmmmmm.<br />Any kind of high end &#34;sniper rifles&#34; have to be zeroed (matched to the physical atributes of) the shooter in order to get perfect shots right off the bat.  You do not simply kill a dedicated sniper, pick up his zeroed weapon and start making perfect 800 meter shots with it.<br />A very old RPG 7 will most certainly not penetrate the frontal armor of an M1 Abrams tank, any generation.  By the way there, It looked like a full company of armor online in front of the WH, I heard the order given to assault, Why did only one tank move out and why did they stop when one tank was hit?  I realize hollywood is too stupid to understand but, in a frontal assault, people, or tanks, get hit.  You do not simple sit down and start crying becasue one guy is down.  The rest go on to the objective, no matter what.<br />The scene with the &#34;delta force&#34; helos &#34;attacking&#34; the WH?  Why did they not put their troops on the roof?  Instead they came in, and hovered beside the building.  Maybe the director should have put a big bullseye on the side, or would that have been too obvious?<br />The presidential limo is being chased around the lawn by armored vehicles who, BTW, are blowing more rounds than they could possibly be carrying and none of the troops surrounding the grounds opens fire on those vehicles AFTER having been ordered to do so?  For that matter, they could have just blown a gate and let the limo out.  Too simple I guess.<br />The most annoying thing, about this movie, was the whole, &#34;evil, right wing,  white guys and the military industrial complex trying to kill the peace loving super smart black president who knows best&#34; routine.  Really.  Makes me want to puke.  It is more like propoganda than entertainment.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|This one is a bit befuddling. The marketing campaign was phenomenal, the clips they put together were highly intriguing, and the fact that Ridley Scott director of Alien which btw was scary as hell has intrigued me even more. Was so hyped I went to see this on opening weekend at theater and was disappointed, movie didn't connect as it should have, the characters weren't developed enough and the story went way too fast, I did purchase the Blu-ray due to the extras offered to get a deeper understanding of the film but still not as satisfied as I'd like to be. It is a feast for the eyes the cinematography is top notch it just seemed hurried. SLOW DOWN Ridley, put a little more passion into your efforts. Oh and as always Fastbender delivers.

0380729407|4.0|(Spoilers ahead)<br /><br />I first read (and loved) this book when I was just thirteen--the same age as the two youthful protagonists, Jim and Will. I re-read it several times after that, then put it away for forty years. I recently re-read it and am very glad I did, because I saw things in it as an adult that had escaped me as an impatient adolescent.<br /><br />First, as a child I had skipped quickly through much of Bradbury's poetic language to get to the action, and unfortunately missed more than just the poetry. For example, I had always been puzzled by the fate of Tom Fury; I never really understood how he had been seduced by the carnival and turned into the evil Dwarf. More patient now, I found the answer that had eluded me for years: he was entranced by the Ice Maiden's ice coffin advertising the carnival in front of one of the town's shopfronts. He enters the dark shop and that's the last we see of him until he reappears as the Dwarf. But this action is tacked on, almost offhandedly, to a beautiful but interminable description of the Ice Maiden's coffin, and I had skipped through it too quickly to notice. (Another thing:  I now understand that the &#34;theater&#34; of naked people that Will and Jim spy on is probably a house of prostitution--it had always confused me before.)<br /><br />I've also come to understand that this novel is even creepier and more disturbing than I thought it was when I first read it (I had read it in &#34;The Exorcist&#34; era and that kind of in-your-face horror was my standard of a good horror novel.) We never learn the fate of Miss Foley or Mr. Crosetti, for example--there is speculation at the novel's end, but speculation is all that it is. In the hands of a less skillful writer, this ambiguity would seem like an amateurish plot hole; in Bradbury's hands, it only adds to the general atmosphere of creepiness and dread.<br /><br />And so we are left with the subtle horror of realizing that Miss Foley was probably doomed to wander the world, a 50-year-old in a 12-year-old's body, because the carousel that restored her youth had been destroyed by Charles Halloway.  We also never learn what happens to Miss Foley's real nephew, the one who was replaced by the changeling Mr. Cooger--like Mr. Crosetti, the real nephew simply disappears, never heard from again. And realizing that made me question why Miss Foley so easily accepted the transformed Cooger as her vanished nephew. We are told that the carousel can only make its users younger or older; it doesn't change their physical characteristics. Did Cooger look like the real nephew? Unlikely, as when we meet him as an adult, we are told that he has a very bright, unusual shade of red hair. So then we are left to wonder if Miss Foley was so tempted by the offer of youth that she accepted Cooger without question, even if he didn't resemble her real nephew at all? Which puts the sweet old maid schoolteacher in an entirely different light, rendering her a far more disturbing character than I had thought at first reading.<br /><br />One of the great strengths of this novel (and of Bradbury's Green Town stories in general) is that it so deftly mixes apple-pie, small town Americana with supernatural horror; again and again, Bradbury brings up totemic items like the cigar store Indian, the barbershop pole, the courthouse clock, the library, and makes us look at them with a potent mixture of sentiment and terror.<br /><br />Reading this book again, forty years later, also made me realize another horror, a horror created by the technological &#34;progress,&#34; that Bradbury had no way of envisioning when he wrote it. We are reminded that there was once an America where boys' parents thought nothing of letting their children roam free at night; an America where children actually **did things**, instead of just living their whole leisure lives on the computer or in front of the X-Box. Will and Jim play tag, climb trees, check dinosaur books out of the library, figure out how to make a communications system out of old railroad ties--in short, they just have **fun**, a kind of fun that many kids today don't seem to be able to understand how to create. After all, why make a communications system out of old wood when you can just send an email?<br /><br />With all that said, I did notice some of the flaws of the book as an adult that I hadn't seen before. Bradbury's prose, while beautiful and arresting, is sometimes so over the top that I was often shaking my head and thinking, &#34;C'mon Ray, get over yourself.&#34; It's especially bad when he's hammering home the symbolic appearance of Tom Fury, the lightening rod salesmen, who is described as wearing a &#34;storm-colored&#34; jacket and a &#34;cloud-colored&#34; hat. We get it, Ray, we get it. Tom Fury is a presage of an evil storm approaching--you don't need to pound it home with a sledgehammer. But this is a quibble. If you first read this book as a teen-ager, read it again. You won't be sorry.

I kept turning those pages, waiting to find out what was going to happen.  Although the storyline veered heavily to the highly unlikely, the characters were engaging, the writing competent, and the element of suspense compelling.
B00DQVST76|1.0|The sound and visual quality of the DVD is really bad. The editing is a complete hatchet job with total disregard to seamless continuity and picture quality. The change from colour to black&white in some songs is truly irritating and detracts from the live feel of the show. The use of photos during Like a Virgin and Love Spent is totally ridiculous. What is the point of including a photo album in the middle of a video of a live performance? Seems like Madonna has truly lost her sense of distinguishing quality from crap.

B004LUS390|5.0|I love this app. I had the free version and I liked it enough that I bought the paid version (well worth the cost) and I even went as far as to buy the full program for computer! The app gives you plenty of brush options (about 45 brushes I think?), layers and has all the settings I need for my sketches. For such a low price this is a fairly powerful little tool!<br /><br />Some people complain about the screen size of using this app on a phone, personally i use a Samsung S4 which has a decent size screen (5 inches) and I formally used a Samsung Droid Charge (4.3 inch screen) and I never had a problem with drawing with my fingers. I do have a cheap stylus for capacitive screens that works with this app but I prefer to use my fingers.<br /><br />The main feature that I love is the ability to import a picture from the phones camera. I often have small sketches/doodles on post-it notes or scrap pieces of paper, I can then take a pic with my phone and work on my rough sketch on Sketchbook Mobile. You don't always have your sketchbook when inspiration hits you, but you always have your cell phone on you!<br /><br />The only downside I can think of is that you don't get the pressure sensitivity on a phone that you'd have on a Wacom enabled device (not the fault of the app I guess) but I'd love to try this on one of the tablets that do have a Wacom stylus.<br /><br />I recommend this for anyone who likes to draw/sketch. From the amateur to the pro. It is absolutely worth the price

B001DHXT6G|1.0|Do not buy this because it is not the original Star Trek. As others have said, all the exterior scenes of the ship have been replaced with CGS, whereas none of the interior scenes have been altered. What makes it especially terrible is that in general the FX at the time were not very good, so now you go from obvious sharp CGS to hokey cardboard sets. The transition is painful and makes it hard to watch at times.<br />I mean what is the point of redoing the outerspace portions when in the &#34;fight scenes&#34; the body doubles don't look anything like the actors they intend to portray? Such is the allure of the original unaltered Star Trek!

B00B2YH7BS|5.0|There is far more to this film than just the story of the rundown building where some of the greatest albums of all time have been recorded.  It's an insider's look at the recording process and its evolution, featuring insightful commentary from an impressive list of artists who have made some of their best music there and the people behind the scenes.  Dave Grohl (Nirvana, Foo Fighters) made this film to tell the story of the studio where one of the most important albums of his career, \\"Nevermind\\", was recorded.  In doing so, he gave viewers a backstage pass to see the inner workings of a recording studio and what made Sound City the premier recording location for decades (thanks to the Neve recording console), and the switch to the digital era and its impact on music.<br /><br />The first 70 minutes cover the history of Sound City, followed by footage from the recording sessions of the \\"Sound City: Real to Reel\\" album, which features many of the artists that had recorded there.  The album was recorded at Dave's Studio 606 on that Neve console that came from Sound City, which started the whole idea for the film when Dave purchased it.  This is arguably among the best music documentaries ever made.  It does a fantastic job at blending the history of Sound City and the classic albums recorded there with the changing industry and how Sound City weathered the storm until it finally closed its doors.  An impressive filmmaking debut from a guy who hasn't let success go to his head and still cares about making good music what goes into it.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A great book. The shining has been my favorite king book so far, have read about 12 of them. Doctor sleep is not scary like the shining, more of a page turner. It can stand on its own, but do yourself a favor and read the shining first.
B000FCK65W|5.0|I am 82.  This was the first best selling novel I ever read as a kid.  Still a favorite.  Movie a pretty good version.  Not complete but close
B0035YDM4Y|3.0|i liked the book but only gave it three stars as it delved too deeply into other matters as opposed to the redwings mission.<br />the description of combat is accurate and confusion reigns.<br />perhaps with more emphasis on mission context and a little less quasi religious and patriotic fervour?<br />ripping read all the same
B00APJLY0Q|2.0|When I decided to watch this film, I did so because I love old monster movies and because it was directed by Genndy Tartakovsky, whose work I have admired for some time.<br /><br />However, this film is ultimately a disappointment, because it boils down to just being another movie for Adam Sandler and his friends. Almost all of the  main characters are voiced by people that Sandler regularly works with, like Kevin James, David Spade, Steve Buscemi, Jon Lovitz. etc. Now this doesn't mean the acting is bad. The actors in this film do a good enough acting job to suspend your disbelief...or they would have were it not for Adam Sandler voicing Count Dracula.<br /><br />This is my main complaint of the film. You could not have picked a worse person to voice Count Dracula. I realize that in this film, Dracula is not the devilishly charming demon in disguise, but rather a comedic overprotective father, but still, I can't get past the fact that every time he opens his mouth, I don't believe it's Dracula. Sandler is doing his best impression of Bela Lugosi, although that's not saying much since it's probably one of the WORST Lugosi impressions I've ever heard, and the bottom line is that I just can't accept Adam Sandler's voice as Count Dracula. So that basically soiled the film for me from the very start.<br /><br />Like I said in the title, this film is basically an animated version of &#34;The Grown-Ups&#34;, except the characters are monsters. and SURPRISE SURPRISE, several of the actors from &#34;The Grown-Ups&#34; are in this movie! Who would have thought? If I had to sum this film up in one word, it would be: Immature.<br /><br />The film relies heavily on slapstick, fart jokes, puns, and stereotypes. Which I found genuinely surprising, because when your premise is a hotel that has monsters from all over the world coming to visit, it seems like there is a near ENDLESS potential of jokes there that can reference the classic films. And to be fair, the film does do that....very sparingly.<br /><br />I will give the film praise for being beautifully animated. The castle/hotel is superbly rendered and the characters are well-designed and move realistically (for a slap-stick comedy), but to be honest? That's not good enough. It's one thing to say a film is technically and visually beautiful, but unless you're the ONLY studio bringing out that level of quality, it's not good enough. The script is juvenile. So no matter how well the animation is done, I still can't help but cringe at the awful jokes and Sandler's grating fake Romanian accent.<br /><br />To sum up, the movie is for small children. That's it. There's nothing in here for an adult viewer, unless of course you have a very immature sense of humor. So...basically, if you're someone who finds the Grown-Ups movies funny. But if you're sense of humor is a bit more refined, and you want to enjoy a monster themed movie with your kids, there are plenty of good ones that you can enjoy as well, like Monsters Inc. (or it's prequel), The Nightmare Before Christmas, or even Frankenweenie.<br /><br />But this? This was a complete waste of my time and money. The only reason I'm giving it two-stars is because of my praise for the art and competent animation (I'm actually considering buying the art book, because I'd like to see how the film was panning out in it's developmental stages and see &#34;what could have been&#34;)
0802130208|1.0|I actually threw this book in the trash I hated it so much.  There is nothing redeeming about the main character and based on some other reviews I read, he does nothing to redeem himself in the end.  I really tried to read this book, but found myself disgusted and put off by the main character's shallowness and narcissism. I do not have time to read a book I hate.  This gets rave reviews and even won a Pulitzer Prize.  I must not get it, because I found it to be a drain on my time and a waste of my money.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Wonderful book.  Funny, poignant and insightful.  It gives the reader a better understanding of the lives of quadriplegics.  I have never read this author before, but  intend to get her other books.  I didn't want the book to end.  I was afraid of what was going to be a sad ending.  By the time I finished, I had to agree with Will.  In any situation, having a choice is most important.<br />This was a true love story.

B00E6890RG|5.0|Haken &#34;The Mountain&#34;.  This album left me SPEECHLESS since the first round.  It still does after many times carefully listening to it.  Prog-Metal in its highest level with so many changes, extreme technical complexity, delicate and impeccable vocals and choirs, drumming mastery of Mr. Raymond Hearne.  To me, &#34;In Memoriam&#34;  track is the most beautifully executed prog-metal song I have heard in a long, long time.  This album is a MUST.
B00BAXFECK|4.0|I like it and it is clearly erudite but the fundamental assertion that life is meaningless but we should nonetheless imbue it with meaning is so Albert Camus...and his starker exposition is less showing off than that of our fine author here.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Jane Austen is my favorite writer. This adaptation was very well acted and one of my favorite versions ever produced. The characters were more in line with what I think they would have looked like and behaved than other more romanticized casts.
0553386697|4.0|This book is worth reading! Though it talks about Children's brain, it is not a theoretical book. Very straightforward so it is easy to read. This book provides 12 strategies that based on the theory of integrating the left and right brain, integrating the upstairs brain and the downstairs brain, integrating memory, integrating the many parts of myself, and integrating self and other. I really like its idea about connecting your child's right brain first to acknowledge their feeling and emotion at that moment first before dealing logically with the issues at hand.<br />Another thing i like about this book is that it gives many examples that are quite common for parents. I am not hundred percent sure the suggestions provided in the book work for your kids, but at least you could try it and see.<br />Also, this book has cartoons to explain the theories, which is also good for you to share the knowledge of brain with your kids. At the end of the book,it provides a chart of strategies for kids from different ages(0-12 ages), which is convenient and valuable for parenting as well.
B00A50PDDY|5.0|I saw these guys at Bonnaroo and loved their set.  They had a ton of energy and creativity in addition to different and interesting music.  I bought both albums right away and can't stop listening to them.  They're both solid pieces of music.  Vessel is probably my favorite of the 2 but not by a lot.<br /><br />Best tracks off this album are Guns for Hands, Car Radio, Holding Onto You and The Run and Go.  Trees and Truce are also quite good if you're looking for something more contemplative.

1439190275|1.0|I have just ordered this book but was viewing the read inside option on Amazon.  In the introduction the author quotes Albert Einstein saying Einstein remarked; &#34;Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again but expecting different results.&#34;<br />Einstein never uttered that statement.  Further that is a far better description of stupidity or obstinance than insanity, as Einstein would have known.<br /><br />I point this out that if the author has attributed a flawed statement to a great scientist in his introduction it lends itself that all his references and attributions through the remainder of the book shall be suspect.<br /><br />I will read the book when it arrives, but felt this glaring oversight raises credibility concerns

B00AYB0SQQ|5.0|Ever since I saw this movie when it was released in 1998, I just loved it. It has a great cast, great writer and director. I must have seen this movie 50 times by now. I don't want to get into the plot because...well...it’s a 15 year old movie, I’m sure everyone knows it by now. If not I’m sure all the other reviews have it in great detail.<br />What I wanted to talk about was the lack of a special edition DVD or blu ray. It seems like there are a lot of fans of this movie, but I don’t think many people know about all the deleted scenes that were taken out. A whole character wound up on the cutting room floor named Venus. She can briefly be seen in the scene where Mr. Furlong gets bit from the parasite when they put it in the aquarium. I guess they also cut out a lot of Gabe’s (Usher) scenes. Just look at the TV spots on YouTube and you can see a few of them. IMDB has a great list of all the known scenes that were cut.<br />There are a lot of fans that would greatly appreciate a special edition or directors cut version. Not sure why they haven’t released any of it yet. And if you haven’t seen this movie yet, definitely give it a view. Great fun movie.

B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I was excited when I saw this out for the Kindle. Downloaded it right away and love it. I'm hooked on this one as much as I was hooked on the Facebook version. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys these type of games.

B0093WVND4|5.0|This was a super funny book.  This book will spark an interest in young readers.  If you have a kid or a grandchild you may want you child to read more.  Roald Dahl is one of the authors I find interesting for a child.  He has the ability to make kids want to read, no not just want to read, LOVE to read!  If you want to get a book for you kid you should go and get a Roald Dahl book for you or your family.  Hope you enjoy the book as much as I did.  You can never outgrow a book.  Hope you get a copy of the book soon.

B0038W0OIK|3.0|Now I have been a fan of SteelSeries for a while now (probably for about 5 years, ever since they gave me a free 5Hv2 at a lan for beating a pro CS 1.6 player :) ). I really loved the 5Hv2 because it was so comfortable and didn't squeeze my head and it fit around my ears pretty well. Of course, the 5Hv2 wasn't a very high quality headset when it comes to gaming, it was more mid-quality.<br /><br />So I decided it was time to upgrade to one of SteelSeries' newer headsets and I got the 7H. The first thing I noticed was that the ear cups were a bit smaller than the ones on the 5Hv2 which actually caused the edge of my ears to sit slightly on the edge of the ear cup, which was definitely more noticeable the more I tried it. But then again, this issue depends on each person and their ear shape/size. The second thing I noticed was the headset was a bit tight on the head compared to the 5Hv2, which I wouldn't have had a problem with but it was starting to get uncomfortable about 20 minutes into wearing them. Yet again, this could change based on a person's head shape/size.<br /><br />Now for the sound quality, this headset was pretty good mostly in terms of the lows of sounds. I definitely noticed a deeper and richer sound than with other headsets I tried (without using a sound card), but I also noticed that for everything the sound was a bit deeper to the point where one could say it was less clear-sounding. However, overall, I did enjoy the sound quality of this headset especially for the bass quality when watching movies or playing a game.<br /><br />I didn't try the Virtual Surround 7.1 because I got a sound card anyways (Sound Blaster ZX) and wanted to be able adjust some settings within the sound card for the headset, and for the headphone amp in the sound card. And I really just prefer 3.5mm jack instead of USB because of the higher quality and easier ability to switch between speakers and headset while in a game without having to minimize a game and going to the Windows sound options.<br /><br />And let me tell you, SteelSeries customer support is awesome. Even though I got the headset for free from them, the 2 times that I accidentally broke them (my fault!), they replaced them without question. I think they even sent me the new one first and I sent them the broken one in the same box back.<br /><br />I am looking forward to try their new SteelSeries 9H which looks seriously awesome.<br /><br />The Good:<br />-Deep/rich lows (great for music or movies)<br />-SteelSeries customer service is soooo good<br />-Easy to adjust for vertical length<br />-Cool retractable mic<br />-(Haven't tried it) 7.1 virtual surround sound is probably pretty cool for some games<br /><br />The Bad:<br />-Ear cups are a bit smaller than 5Hv2 so it didn't go around my ear very nicely (depends on ear size/shape)<br />-A bit tight on the head (but perhaps it would stretch out if you wear it long enough?)

B00G6Q29KQ|5.0|*I was given a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review*<br /><br />Currently the final installment of the series, OutMove is the culmination of Nate Ryder’s spectacular journey into spiritual enlightenment. Author Brandt Legg takes you through this series and leaves the reader with a sense of tumbling down the rabbit hole, or choosing the red pill in lieu of the blue. (Really, who wants to wake up in their bed, full of blissful ignorance?)<br />Not only will this series entice the reader and refuse to be put down, it opens a part of you that will have you questioning everything that you thought you once knew. It’s not only a refreshingly new, well written story, it’s a tale that parallels so closely with so many of today’s issues, it can almost be considered a wakeup call.<br />You will fall in love with these characters. You will laugh, cry, find love and heartbreak in this series. Go grab OutView, then Outin, and finish up with this book. You will not be disappointed. I very much look forward to seeing more from Brandt Legg in the future. 5-Stars!
B00FJU1HLC|5.0|I thought that this movie was going to be awful. And, for the first I don't remember how long, I found myself wishing that my family would lose interest and choose to watch something else. I couldn't stand the character played by Nicolas Cage. However, at some point both that character and the movie redeemed itself. And, I found myself actually enjoying the film... a lot. So, if you can endure both Nicolas cage and the character to whom he gives voice for a seemingly long while, then you may really enjoy this movie. If that is too much to ask, you may not. (In the last case: Run away! Don’t walk! Run!)

B00DIMXTBO|5.0|*I was given a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review*<br /><br />A spectacular, vivid journey<br /><br />Following Nate Ryder on the next part of his journey, Outin leads the reader on an adventure into a world not too far off from our own. While Outin itself is a spiritual oasis, the rest of the world has fallen to commercialized wasteland, and it’s up to Nate and his friends to save us all.<br />Reaching deep down, Author Brandt Legg captures a world that could easily be seen, and at once entices and scares the reader. The few rich controllers of society don’t want Nate and his friends to unveil the powers that lie within all of us.<br />Outin shows us not only the possibilities of what could be, but also the possibilities of what each of us, as people, are capable of. It’s a refreshing read, with a heartwarming message that you won’t be able to put down. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a well written adventure. Don’t forget to start with OutView to get the best experience possible.

B00881VLCE|5.0|FANTASTIC puzzle for my 5 yr old non-verbal, Autistic daughter. She plays it every day. It's helped her greatly with learning to match up connected pieces, memory, as far as where a piece of puzzle would be located in reference to the picture itself, also the gratifying feeling she gets from completing a complicated task and much more... All n' all, bottom line that really counts is that she just straight up LOVES the game. Every day she asks for her Kindle Fire HD and straight to it, Magic Puzzle is her first game to start her day, then she plays it on and off thru-out the rest of the day. I'm more than pleased with the way the puzzle can be played with such ease allowing even beginners to play it with ease! I give it a two-thumbs-up... (Coming from a stay at home, mother of 3 young children, 5 yrs old and under). I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS GAME FOR ANY CHILD AROUND 3yrs OLD AND UP... (unless your 2yr old is above avg with computer skills... :-)

0062107313|5.0|I always think that half-way through is a good time to write a review.  That way I'm not swayed by my approval of the conclusion, rather than how I experience the reading of it.  So, no need to worry about spoilers from me...<br /><br />I've enjoyed all of Amy Tan's previous books to varying degrees.  This one drew me in immediately.  Hook, line and sinker, as it were.  In fact, I find myself thinking of the author a lot as I read, an internal monologue rolling:  \\"Amy Tan, you better not let anything else bad happen to this character.  I like her too much!\\"<br /><br />The main character in this story, Violet, begins the book as a child becoming increasingly aware of what's going on in her mother's high-class courtesan house in Shanghai.  Miss Tan characteristically delivers a gentle history lesson in depicting the backdrop of China changing as it emerges from imperial rule.  Violet's mother, a savvy American business woman and expert on human character, draws in clients not only by fulfilling their romantic and sexual desires but by orchestrating unusual business connections between the westerners and Chinese.<br /><br />We experience Violet's growing awareness of her mother's dealings, and shedding of idealism as she enters a womanhood of compromises similar to her mother's.  More political upheaval changes the climate for westerners in China, as our Violet continues to struggle to ride the waves and stay upright.<br /><br />Amy Tan manages once again to give us a view of people in tragic circumstances faced with mind-bending choices and forced to move on when we'd expect them to give up.  This is an effective cure for those who believe themselves incapable of acting as others have in harsh conditions, because it puts us right in the middle of the squeeze of necessity and circumstances.  Violet's mother was bent on self-determination in a fatalistic world, and Violet struggles in the same way.  I find myself wanting to rip out second half of the book and write my own ending for the good of the characters.  However, experience has taught me that whatever turmoil lies ahead in Amy Tan's version is well worth the journey.wn ending for the good of the characters.

B009ZQFSRA|4.0|good movie, had a few twists and was entertaining.<br /><br />Christian Bale and Taye Diggs did great jobs playing clerics. the price for a world devoid of emotion to keep the peace is sometimes too high.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Denzel lowered himself to star in this movie. Not the greatest performance of his career. Not much of a plot or story.
B0045HCJ8U|5.0|Totally awesome performance by young Brando as the tortured Kowalski. Vivien Leigh was also astounding as the deranged sister of the long suffering Stella.
B0049EZHXS|4.0|The Fan Edition is a very nice thing to add to any linkin park collection. Sure it may not be one of their best album due to it being an experimental album but it is worth having.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Plot is exciting and interesting to a point,  but the more one watches, the more one has to suspend reality until the ending become totally ludicrous.
B000QE9ERK|3.0|This film was mediocre at best. Johnny Depp was wasted in this movie. He was miscast. Don't bother with it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|One of the most addictive games I've ever played. Had app for my phone and was stuck on luck 65. Then my phone started acting up and couldn't play at all. Now that it's available on Kindle, I'm back and happy to say I past lol 65 and still addicted as ever! Definitely recommend it!
B008602KQI|4.0|I read the books which were very entertaining.  I couldn't imagine them being made into a movie that would do the &#34;games&#34; justice.  The movie did just that.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|A great way to get you and your family into the Christmas spirit. It is a must have for every video library.
0763644765|5.0|This book has magic spells...beware :) my little girl loved it and showed more interest in training after reading it together. Loved it
B00EDLP6O2|5.0|These games is like a 3d and realistic Xbox or play station game .<br />If you don't you will be missing out of a lot of fun.
B00G32OER4|5.0|I saw this film in the theater when it was originally released, and really enjoyed it -- I loved the setting (1970's) and I liked that it was authentically scary without relying on gore or murders and it was &#34;clean&#34; -- little, if any swearing, no nudity, no sex.  When my daughter (8th grade) asked if she could have friends over to watch a scary movie, and they chose this one, I allowed it because it was reasonably clean.  They were REALLY scared by it, but, isn't that the point?  Thankfully, none of them seems to have been &#34;scarred&#34; by it.  I liken it to the 1980's film, Poltergeist -- seriously scary, nobody dies a gory death, and there's nothing in it a parent would blush about if watching it with a tween/teen.  Besides that, the story held my attention, the acting was great and really drew you in.  It's a really great edge-of-your-seat scary movie.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|A Amd board that came ready to receive a FX 6350 Cpu without doing a bios update first.  Great black color.
B008NEVP1S|5.0|Aimee Mann is my favorite musical artist, and this CD does not fail to please. If you are thinking of checking her out, get this CD.
B008GOG98Y|4.0|This coming of age story still rings true after 4 decades.  It's more than a period piece.  And if you attended IU Bloomington in the 70's, as I did, it rates high for nostalgia with its town and campus shots.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|I love the Camel club and its members and  all the things they get involved in.  OK Baldacci - it is time for another Camel club book to come out!!!  We gotta keep an eye on this questionable government we have here!
B00CP2Z5TC|3.0|This is a solid album with catchy songs, but isn't nearly as good as the previous two albums.  This album seems to be about their religious questions and struggles in life.  Let's be honest and admit that Vampire Weekend is a house band that you love listening to as you sip a cocktail on the beach.  If I wanted a dark reflection on my religious convictions I would whip out my grunge albums from the 90s.  Keep with the theme of the first two albums and we can all enjoy catchy tunes while we sip gin and tonics on a nice summer day.
0740748475|4.0|I purchased this set as an anniversary present for my hubby and he loved it. The only reason this is not receiving 5 stars is because one of the back corners of the box holding the books was dented. Since the dent is in the back and purely aesthetic we decided to keep the set instead of returning it. I think the dent had more to do with the way the set was shipped than the actual product itself. The shipping box was huge and mostly filled with air filled plastic bags as padding. The books caused the box weight to be quite uneven. Other than that the books are beautifully presented in the box set.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I love this series so far.  Martin's plot twists never stop surprising me.  I also love how the constantly changing perspectives force me to empathize with all of the characters.
B007BZM3HK|3.0|I bought this song for my seven year old daughter.  She loves it and listens to it repeatedly much to my chagrin.
B009ZE27US|1.0|it never does your age only by luck.  and when you do it again it doesn't stick with the same number
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I love this series so far.  Martin's plot twists never stop surprising me.  I also love how the constantly changing perspectives force me to empathize with all of the characters.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|I really like this camera app! It's really fun to use and better than the other camera on the device. With this one, you can edit your picture and with the one on the device, all you can do is take a picture.
B00GOQ9M4O|3.0|This episode makes me miss my favorite character Merle even more. Last season was obviously the best season for the Walking Dead. The governor is an interesting character, however he is the Hitler of the Apocalypse! Nothing less than his other eye being poked out for his past atrocities would be acceptable for this series.This man is passed redemption! Trying to make him sympathetic makes me nauseous!This is a stupid trend I see Hollywood making for despicable scumbag bad guys. I would hope the writers would be more creative than trendsetting.<br /><br />Ronn Sven
B00EEPFRGE|4.0|This folks is a great disc.  I'm not going to be too in depth here about the new disc though do know that I've always liked the band. I am a concert promoter and went to see the first re-union tour a few years back and it was clearly great.  I recall tons of the \\"Black Metal\\" Denver band guys being there rockin' their faces off.  One of those fellows was like \\"Man, I have always loved this band, they are one of my fav's and are always fantastic!\\"  There ya go...enough said right! :)<br /><br />So, their last few discs (and like all their classic discs) have had some goods tunes, but these tunes are better!  Michael (who is still at the top of his game) sounds blisteringly kick-ass!  No s*** ;)  (Also note that Tony Harnell is also sounding amazing in general too and is back with TNT).  NMHTP is the best outing \\"song-wise\\" for these boys in the last 15 years.  Cool? CHECK IT!
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Not to bad of a game could have more farm growing stuff and ways to get more crowns faster but who can be picky when your buying something for free.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Just started playing this. I love castles and thought this would be fun. Repetion is the key to this game
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|What  a cute movie!  My wife & I saw Despicable 2 a few months back, and we've always wanted to know how Gru came to have the three orphans.  The little meanies are very adorable, and the whole movie was well done.  Normally I don't care much for animated &#34;kid&#34; movies, but this (and the second one) is an exception.  Really, if you haven't seen this movie, DO!  It's well worth it.
B000001FGG|5.0|This is a truly classical album and one of Cream's best. It is a shame that the band only lasted a few years or they would have gone down in history as one of the best ever.<br /><br />This album competes with Disraeli Gears for the top spot in the Cream canon. Any true fan should own both (if not all of Cream's albums).<br /><br />My copy arrived promptly and the condition was consistent with how it was advertised. Over all I am very pleased.
B002KS1IJC|4.0|Good, entertaining, better written then most high budget action films. Better than the Will Smith's or Tom Cruises end of humanity movies.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|You can always count on plenty of action in a Jimmy Bond movie and this one does not disappoint! 5 stars from this fan!
B00000DQSS|5.0|A Stunning Piece of Work!!! Kate Bush is the epitome of creativity. My favorite track on the album is Delius.
B00CATSONE|4.0|I found this short book quite interesting. Tesla is not someone I knew much about, but was quite fascinating bad gave me a lot of information about his life and work. I can't help but think about what our world could have been if his work was not blocked at every turn by money grubbers t the first part of the 20th century.
0385537131|4.0|Interesting book but not one of my favorite John Grisham books. I can tell you this - after reading it I dislike lawyers more than I did when I started the book (which was a lot to begin with).
B00DU74U74|5.0|I'd read the book and thought this story very hard to make a movie of...but they did extremely well...even my wife, not such a scifi fan, loved it!
B001GMH8SI|4.0|One of my favorite. A beautiful film and has a nice indie feel to it. It will definitely inspire you to travel more despite the sad ending. But I won't give too much of it away for those who have not seen it.
B0016JBCJW|3.0|It is definitely a Wes Anderson film in his style. I just felt the movie was too big for the story. I would check out other Wes Anderson films before this one.
B003VPWXRO|5.0|Loved the book, inspiring! I will not waste time being obsessed with food and my body anymore. Cheers to good health and happiness Portia!
B00BPDR3F6|3.0|The book started out great, and remained so for over 2/3rds: the story of Henry Whittaker and his rise to riches was fun to read. With Alma Whittaker's birth (Henry's daughter), Gilbert really takes off into a fine entertainment. Alma's development from precocious child to young scientist, to awkward womanhood, to late bride, to traveler, and finally to genuine scientist, is wonderfully recounted.<br /><br />But...the major mis-step for me came with the appearance of Tomorrow Morning. From the moment he enters the scene to the wacky embarrassing mystical exchange on the mountain, I felt that Gilbert was throwing away a solid story and resorting to some kind chick-lit sexual/spiritual mumbo-jumbo.<br /><br />When that portion of the novel is over and we rejoin Alma in the Netherlands, the book becomes fun again, and very much worth reading. But I suspect many readers consider the Tahiti section a high point in the book, a place where &#34;truths&#34; are uncovered and satisfaction attained. To me, that's scary.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|A wonderful performance by Denzel Washington.  Loaded with suspense,  Appeared to be on the money with the industry jargon.  An unsuspecting conclusion.
B00GH4R95C|5.0|It is exactly how i always imagined Superman to be. From his history, to his decisions, to his outfit, I grew up with TV reruns and Christopher Reeves Movies of Superman. They all were entertaining but to me, it just wasn't how &#34;I Imagined&#34; Superman was to be portrayed on Screen.<br />It deals a lot more with his &#34;Alien&#34; lineage, which to me is very important. After All, &#34;Superman&#34; is an Alien and not a &#34;Man&#34; at all.<br />So it helps to understand the choices he makes more understandable and deeper. Born an Alien, Raised a Human.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I LOVE The Piano Guys and this doesn't disappoint. It has all my favorites on it. Listening to their music takes me to a wonderful place. Not only are they outstanding musicians, they seem like truly nice guys! And I love that they have fun doing it. So glad I found them.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It's just amazing it's just a great book well written,! Very sad but it was amazing though! I loved it
0385537131|5.0|Sycamore Row - a worthwhile read!<br /><br />This is Grisham at his finest.  He has picked up where he left off in his very first book, \\"A Time to Kill\\".  It is clear that this is truly one of Gridhmsn's best works.<br /><br />This is a book, that once started, begins to unfold and does not stop.  The reader gets a real sense of the town in which  the story takes place and actually becomes a part of the story.<br />The plot is one that is so unsual that it immediately takes the reader by surprise and rolls the action out, page after page.<br /><br />Without giving any part of the story away, there is  great character development in this story and  the intensity does not stop until the very end.<br />The best character in this story, in my opinion is the judge!  Enjoy!<br /><br />This is a great long weekend read for those who are looking to relax and rest with a marvelous book.  This is THAT book!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|This show is one of the best out there.  It's witty and classy, and the actors are wonderful.  Maggie Smith makes the show I think.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I can't get enough of this game. I quit reading my kindle just so I can  keep up with some of my friends and try to catch others. It's a blast!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Try this game if you like adventure and fantasy. Lots of things to do and see. Great for consuming free time.
1476727651|4.0|I'm a very avid Stephen King and Dean R. Koontz fan. While this may not be as excellent a book ever written by King I found it a very enjoyable read. Just finishing up with it now.
B00FEQ3VFG|3.0|Purchased this in Disney World for about the same price. My 3-year old daughter had this out of the box less than 5 minutes before the snowman's right arm fell off. It fits into a slot on his body, but was not glued in well. Put some gorilla glue in there when we got back from vacation and it seems to be holding better. Expected better quality from Disney.
B00E9P959O|5.0|i always knew Rush meant to express more with this album than what was audible.  i tried endlessly to EQ it to a place that made sense, but the source was pegged and corrupted.  this remaster, while unfortunate in it's necessity, is brilliant in execution.  THIS is the the album i wanted to hear/that i KNEW was in there somewhere - funny how expression can be sooo very restricted by over statement.  all of the songs are louder in the freedom of the new dynamic expressed in this version.  this makes sense.  this is beautiful.  yeah, maybe it cost me 9 extra bucks to hear it, but it's a very small price to pay for this amount of brilliance.
B008XCJ03K|5.0|Sit down and listen- a good album altogether. Unlike some other popular songs out there right now- I found myself enjoying the album and not buying just the single
B008HJGPVO|1.0|This stylus is a definite disappointment.  Four times out of five the screen doesn't respond to the touch of this stylus.  It surprised me since I'd bought a very inexpensive set of three stylus for a price LESS than this ONE, and they work consistently and beautifully.  This stylus has a more professional appearance, than the package of three, and I wanted that for my business look.<br />  I do like the style of the stylus, but if it doesn't work, then what's the point?
B005J4TLO8|2.0|Quite a bit of unused talent. Even though I'm wearisome of the Seth Rogan/Jonah Hill crowd, this film might have benefited from one of them (I hate to admit). Jonah Hill has a gift for improv, and his presence here would have stolen the show from Aziz Ansari. That said, Danny McBride, as usual, steals most of the scenes in this film.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I loved the Divergent series, all three books. However, Allegiant took me by surprise and I can honestly say I'm not sure about my feelings for the ending of this book, I loved it but at the same time, I wanted more.
B001FB55M6|3.0|A little better than I expected. To my mind, Jim Carrey has lost his mind and his business sense, not to mention the invention that that inspired such greats as \\"Dumb and Dumber.\\" Easy allusion I know, but it is his most iconic role. Zooey Deschanel, as always, is beautiful and enchanting.
0060254920|3.0|I don't know why I don't love this book as much as everyone else does.  It just doesn't appeal to me.  It is okay and I will read it to my daughter, but it isn't our favorite.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I love Persuasion, I think both versions 1995 this one and 2007 are both outstanding and similar from the novel by Jane Austen. One of her best and the last one she wrote before her death, the letter from the Hero Captain Wentworth warms the heart and chills you, it is not be missed. I also love the other version, newer as much. the actors do a fine job in each.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This was one of my favorite Grisham novels.  It actually resembled a historical fiction novel which I love because I always enjoy learning something new and or reviewing old events and trends.  I have already recommended it to several friends and they have had the same reaction.  It really is a &#34;must read&#34;!
B000A2W1X2|3.0|It did not appeal to me, It was too predictable. I would not recommend it, however it is rare. collectable?
1451666179|5.0|This author is a genius.  I have never laughed so hard as when I discovered her blog.  I am so happy to have a book so I can more easily share the funny universal truths that she illustrates so deftly.  I just wish I was not limited to one copy - I wanted to buy at least four to start so I could give them as gifts.  And I will no doubt buy more in the future to spread the hilarity of our absurd human condition.  When will more copies be available!?!?!?
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|I really liked the book; her writing was excellent.  The characters were very real - not always likeable or rational but then who is?  They were very daring for that time in history, it seemed to me.  Also, I found the book to hold many life lessons for all of us; reminders about what is really important in life and what parts of ourselves we sacrifice by not saying what needs to be said to those we love because we are afraid to be vulnerable.  Finally, I learned a lot about mosses.
B007W8S2MG|4.0|I'd say like 4.5 stars.  Production value is clearly top notch.  Could use some more save-points throughout the dungeons.  I think games like this should have like additional disclaimer sections, for all the kids who play mature games regardless of the rating.  Like, this is a game about high-tech murders, and these kids go about it casually.  Like in terms of lessons conveyed, that might be a very dangerous idea in the way the current world works.  Then again, that could be said for a lot of other forms of media communication.  Lots of work went into this game though, and it's an interesting story nonetheless.  Slightly repetitive when you play it on very hard.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|Brainless fun, but not a lot of skill required to progress through game.  Plus when did deer sound like a sheep when they get shot?
B006VP1OYO|3.0|It was a gift and she said it was good, but it might be a bit to edgy for her.
0515141429|5.0|What can I say about Jack Reacher? He is the best. Lee Child does it again in this thriller. Good Buy
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love my Google Chromes! (Yes... I own 3.) They are perfect for smart phone users who want to play things on a tv without having to go through a blu-Ray player or game system. I highly recommend!
0440246008|5.0|Jack Reacher is always a badass and this book is just as exciting as the rest. Good read. Well Done
B00CH26TL8|3.0|This game is really fun, but the drawback is once you run out of lives you have to log into facebook to give yourself more lives. This is all fine and dandy for people who have facebook, but for those of us who don't it kind of sucks. After I ran out of lives I had to remove the game from my kindle.
0440246016|5.0|I only give Lee Child's Jack Reacher series five stars. I have not read one that I was disappointed with. This one included.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|difficult to set up.....works ok with pre-programed channels, however the time monkeying around with it far exceeds hooking an HDMI cable to your computer and being wired.......great idea that needs some tweaking to really save time and reduce wires.....

B00A6CCF0K|2.0|I have been  fan of Stephen King since he first released Carrie. I have read almost every piece of his work, noticing a decline in his novels. Suddenly, works like 11/22/63, Dumas Key and Under the Dome seemed to signal a resurgence of the King stories he so masterfully weaved in days gone by.<br />I then read Dr. Sleep and am afraid that the old master is gone. This effort lacked any depth or content, instead relying on telepathic abilities of a girl and Danny Torrance, hero of the Shining, and their adventures against a band of paranormal gypsies. Not worth going into detail.<br />Sorry to say that this was perhaps the worst work ever from King.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|It's good stuff very pleased with the product and i got exactly what i expected and didn't get something that i didn't expect
B002PMPTIO|5.0|As a Star Trek fan since the original series, I was pretty skeptical when I heard of this remake.  But happily, I enjoyed this revised version and look forward to the sequels.  What you have to understand, though, is that events in this version completely rewrites Star Trek history so that the franchise now has a fresh canvas and can write it's own future without conflicting with what's already out there.<br /><br />For me, the highlight of the movie is Karl Urban's portrayal of McCoy.  I just wonder how many hours he spent watching Star Trek to be so dead on.  In fact, he might just be a better McCoy than DeForest Kelley.  Or maybe just a new and improved version.  The multiple injection gag is just hilarious.<br /><br />I did, however, raise my eyebrows a bit at the romance between Spock and Uhura.  Really?  Well, ok.  This is a different time line so I'll wait and see where it leads.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it yet.

1577314808|5.0|This book is amazing.  I never thought I would be someone to say this, but this book changed my life.  The insightful simplicity of the information enabled me to understand how my constant mind focused living was draining me of my happiness and peace.  I truly believe this book can help absolutely everyone to discover their true nature and live the life they've always known they were ment for.  I owned this book for over a year before I read it for the first time.  If you are here now reading this, you are ready.  Do not delay, your life is about to change.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|This was not your run of the mill YA book!  It was very different and gives an account of life for people in Germany during WWII.  For those left in small towns after the Jews were removed, life was not easy.  The insight that the author has and the way in which the author choses to tell this story was very unusual.  I didn't think I would like at the start but I kept with it and started to see the point that the author had intended.  Kudos to Mr. Zusak!

I know some folks think they are the same but anyway to have one of my favorite country western artist do bluegrass exceeded my expectations.  If you like one and/or both country and bluegrass you are going to love this album.  Not is it great but Alan assembled some of the greatest pickers to make this amazing music.  BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B008CLI4N4|4.0|I like the story of Game Of Thrones, but I do not like the almost constant nudity. It also seems high priced for the amount of episodes one gets, which is about 10 per season. I do not think nudity in a series or a movie, improves it. If it has a good story, then that is all that is needed.<br />  There is lots of fighting, with swords..of course,beheading,rape,sex and other unsavory things.. But, The story catches one's interest and holds that interest.

B00992CF6W|2.0|I bought this app.for my daughter's Nabi. I was hoping it would stop the fights over the xbox minecraft game. I was wrong! It has so few of the features of the full game that both kids find it.boring.

B00F8KIJ2I|1.0|As i've seen a few review's on here that i agree with both positive to some degree and negative, i'll just be brief with this review first off the self titled album \\"avril lavigne\\" which is her 5th album truly is a terrible album and i would definitely say it's her worst to date. However avril choosing a different path to follow musically may have been a bad decision, who really knows why avril changed her style and image, i personally don't like it but hey that's her decision. The reason i personally preferred the more somewhat dark teen agnst punk style avril was because her music is so much more genuwine and complex especially on her second album and she made a hell of a lot better music than what she makes now. This self titled album \\"avril lavigne\\" kick starts with \\"rock 'n' roll\\" which i will say is catchy then follows up with a ballad \\"here's to never growing up\\" which as well i liked but then the album quality drops from there and seems to be nothing but fillers of ballads to the end of the album. One could almost think that avril was given a very tight deadline to meet and had to submit to the labels fast or no release, when will record labels learn you can't rush art when making music. Overall this album was terrible it's worse than \\"goodbye lullaby\\" or do i dare even say \\"The best damn thing\\" avril pretty much shot down her credibility as a musician right after the \\"under my skin\\" album which was her best...period
0307352153|5.0|Perfect book for parents with quiet children and for those who have a gift to engage easily.  It is not so natural for quiet people, often misunderstood.  It is comforting to see there is a need for both and they are of equal value and necessary in the collaboration of humans.  Please don't force an introvert to become an extrovert unless they have personal reasons to strive for that goal themselves.
B00GIXWXEO|4.0|My kids loved it. Lots of action and speed. A great family movie. The snail's dream finally comes true. Not dissapointing!!
B00F35BV64|2.0|It seems to be a rehash of many bits and pieces from Ray Bradberry's past works that just combine into a train wreck of chaos, junk and pain.  Sorry, I was disappointed.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I love this movie. And even more so with its multiple mediums. Digital, DVD, and Bluray were wonderfully welcome to my home.
1451673442|5.0|We all have to be reminded of things in our life of which to be grateful and the positive transformation that we can manifest for ourselves and others. The Magic guides us gracefully through a 28 day practice that we will want to continue forever.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Love this app. It's perfection and so easy. I have it on my kindle and my phone. Can't go wrong with Adobe Reader. It does exactly what it's supposed to.
B00EW9GQR6|4.0|Definitely more of a &#34;concept&#34; album and not as radio-friendly but I still enjoy it.  A lot has been said over whether this album is a flop or not.  I think Gaga has definitely alienated middle America who now find her to weird - but that's actually a good thing.  Let her be weird.  She's a fabulously talented woman!
B004VOBIE8|5.0|The name of this app is a little misleading.  It has the ability to gather files from my file server as well as from Google Drive (as well as others, but these are the two that I use most often).  Before this app I e-mailed documents between devices but now I don't have to.  Instead I just either access the file directly or can easily copy it to my kindle.<br /><br />Of course, it also does file management.  So I am able to clean up documents I had e-mailed to myself before and actually get a good view of what files do exist on my device.<br /><br />This has been very helpful to me
B00GJ8IY28|5.0|Great companion piece to &#34;Swing While You're Winning&#34; which IMHO is Robbie's finest achievement.  Love the duet with Kelly Clarkson, recreating Glen Campbell and Bobbie Gentry's classic pairing of &#34;Little Green Apples&#34;, but really - every song is a gem!
B00FEHXCIG|1.0|Story line sucks and so did the whole movie; save your money and don't bother watching this movie. Don't even watch it if it ever airs on regular TV.
B0089BSM70|5.0|Great transfer, great addition of the TV movie version with different scenes - while not as amazing as the original Halloween, if you watch back to back, you can pretend it's one big movie.
B000083E79|5.0|I love this album.  I play it when I exercise or just when I want to relax.  I am so happy she made another CD.
1451673442|4.0|The author makes it very clear that we should all give thanks for what we have (Gratitude)  and for every thing for being able to get out of bed in the morning to being able to put your self to sleep at night and she lists everything in between. If you or you know someone on the edge that thinks they have nothing to be great full for this might be what you are looking for. It will send you in the right direction.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I was very excited to see one of my favorite games that I could now play on my kindle. It is however, not the same game so all if my progress in castleville does not transfer to legends.  That said I'm giving it a try and so far it does not disappoint.  I would love it if zynga and kindle would get together on more of their games and allow the transfer of levels.
B00FB029IU|5.0|There was some pre-release criticism of this album as unoriginal and not as good as Jake Bugg's debut album. I have to say that I don't agree. I had the good fortune to receive an advance copy of this, and after listening to it a lot I think it is that rare thing: a follow-up album which is as good (or at least nearly as good) as its deservedly phenomenally successful predecessor. It doesn't have that devil-may-care freshness of the first album - but then it wouldn't because that only happens once. The production is a bit fuller and more sophisticated now, and he's widening his style a little but it's still music of real quality.<br /><br />Jake Bugg's great strength is in singable songs with worthwhile lyrics, which he performs with skill and real feeling, and he does just that on this album. His fine, distinctive voice is still on great form and driving beats are still often in evidence, although there's a good variety here. There's also a variety of production styles which make the opening track, There's A Beast And We All Feed It sound like early Bob Dylan, Me And You could be from a Donovan Album from about 1968, the guitar in Messed Up Kids has strong echoes of Big Country, the instrumental work on Kitchen Table could be from John Martyn or Pentangle (and the vocal reminds me a little of Jason Isbell in places)... and so on. Personally I love all this. It's very well done and nothing sounds like a poor imitation of an original.<br /><br />I genuinely think this is a very good album which shows that Jake Bugg isn't just a flash in the pan, and will cement his place in the top rank of young British musicians. Warmly recommended.
B00C3ALLZ8|5.0|The Magic Christian is one of the all time classic Petter Sellers movies. Right up there with the Pink Panther. Terrific cast and funny story line.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Im a big James Bond fan, great movie, I like Daniel Craig as Bond as well, they really turned the franchise on its head at the end,  I like to low tech, great sorry dark version of Bond
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Easy to use. What a great piece of technology! I can't stop printing. Sure with I had a color printer.
B008Y212PI|3.0|After beating all of the puzzles on both difficulties you are given the option to unlock another puzzle by either liking FlipPix on Facebook, or writing a review. I liked this game so I am writing a review. I found most of the puzzles - especially on the easiest setting - far too easy, but interesting enough to keep me playing. I received this game as a Free-App-of-the-Day (FAOTD), and after playing it extensively I can confidently say that had I paid $2, it is still worth a solid 3 stars; being somewhat average in appearance and playability, with very little replay value. As a FAOTD, however, it was quite enjoyable, and in my experience, much better than the average FAOTD.
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|Mistborn is a terrific series. My husband who is an avid fantasy reader read it first and was so obsessed with it he passed it on to our 16 year old. She then passed it on to our 12 year old. I am now in the middle of book 2 and am equally obsessed. I also got my 44 yr old brother to read the series. All of us, with our different interests and ages, have very much enjoyed the series. We hope to see it made into a movie, series, or video game.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Bought this for my 81 year old father for Christmas.  He LOVES Columbo.  So happy to see a complete set of an old series instead of what is new and still on TV.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|Mistborn is a terrific series. My husband who is an avid fantasy reader read it first and was so obsessed with it he passed it on to our 16 year old. She then passed it on to our 12 year old. I am now in the middle of book 2 and am equally obsessed. I also got my 44 yr old brother to read the series. I am the only one who hasn't finished the series but the other 4 people in my family say that book 3 is the best of the series. All of us, with our different interests and ages, have very much enjoyed these. We hope to see it made into a movie, series, or video game.
0545265355|5.0|Of course we love the books and the movies!  This was a present for my daughter and in this age of eBooks we wanted her to have something tangible that she would have for a lifetime.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|The story could have been told in 100 pages or fewer. Instead, Grisham filled the tale with unending extraneous details that were boring and unnecessary.  The premise was fascinating and, while the reader is anxious to know the solution, the laborious journey getting there was irritating.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Fun for a movie for a quick entertainment. Excellent for children and females.  Good deal if you are watching for a fun evening.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Always beautiful, simple and to<br />The point. Don Miguel Ruiz never disappoints on his beautiful depiction of the Toltec philosophy.
B00005LIN0|4.0|Always like Gershwin.  One can listen over and over again.  A classic that can never be outdone  and one of the best
B00AC8ZJ6K|3.0|Movie starts off strong with decent character development but I felt like it ended halfway through. Where is the conclusion?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush is an addictive game! Careful if are to get it I became addicted after one play. I am glad it is finally on the Kindle Fire and have been playing it nonestop it seems! If you are looking for a good new app look no farther because you ha e found it!
B00BAXFECK|5.0|What a great pleasure this book was! Exciting, profound, moving. As a painter, I enjoyed the deep understanding of a beautiful painting that this narrative is woven around.
B003G4W49C|5.0|There are books out there that span generations and speak broadly to topics inherently human, this is one such book.  If you're into military, politics, sci-fi and the greater questions of humanity you need to read this book.  There are reasons this book like others, Starship Troopers for one, are required reading in many Military Academies/War Colleges, because they matter yesterday, today and tomorrow.  Oh, and they simply are a joy to read too.
B005J3IEZQ|4.0|Illuminating and surprisingly honest insights into Steve Jobs and the interconnection between his personality, creativeness and management style. Unique or a style guide for others?
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I would recommend that you put in a bank option where your money doubles over time. I would also like the game to have cheaper gun price
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I prefer the challenges to sharing with Facebook ... not all of my friends appreciate the hammer messages.  Other than that, rather enjoyable.
B0064MGU98|3.0|Uneven and inconsistent writing from episode to episode.  Some of the Interesting story lines with family members were abandoned part way through the season.  But mostly we were disappointed with the lack of maturity eventually written for the lead character - the finale was junior high school level stuff at best.  Can't we expect better of American TV?
B000E6FSPW|5.0|This CD has the most inspirational workout montage music EVAR!!  Robert Tippon and Survivor are quintessentially 80's.  Blasting this in the gym will surely get the ladies to notice you while you work on your completely jacked physique!!  Don't forget leg day.
B004JMY312|5.0|Love this Movie - watch it whenever I can. Love the cast and the music and a good family movie for Halloween
B008JFLWLE|5.0|Captures the vision of tablet computing. Just feels convenient and fun for simple calculations which are the vast majority of what one does.
B00CRMX53S|5.0|Nice fun song, has the flavor of some great &#34;funkadelics&#34; from the 70's and love the guitar work. The lead vocal is a bit flat unless he is singing in harmony with others, though. Still, good Daft Punk stuff!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love the movies...Love this game! Enough said. Just wish the app would update faster...that's my only complaint so far. Seriously. If you love the movies get this game. You won't regret it
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This product just ruined my tv.  Had it one day and wake up the next morning and my screen is destroyed.  Supposedly has built in burn in prevention.  But there is a horrible burn in of the ready to cast screen on my tv. And my tv was turned off all night.  Was only left on for a few hours.  Love good but this is a crap product not ready to go live. Will be returning 35 dollar product but hundreds of dollars in damage! Buy at your own risk I guess because I have a feeling Google will not do a damn think about it to help me.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Has all the weather features I was looking for, and more. I especially like the radar map that has the overlay of cities and their local stats.
B003QS67F0|5.0|Very intriguing movie, great acting. You have to stay focused to keep up, but well worth it. Keeps you wondering.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|James Bond truly at his best.  Casino Royale was a great Introduction to Daniel Craig but SkyFall really captures the spirit of the James Bond character.
B00BATKPBE|3.0|Its an autobiography and is a bit dull. There is a message which is to wonder about things worth perhaps one chapter.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|Why did it take me so long to discover this author and this series? I can't wait to read another episode in the career of Harry Hole, a unique fascinating character. He is no super-hero, but a human with human failings. But he makes a fascinating lead character.
B000L53D4O|2.0|I thought this was flimsy, and the activities on the front are not very entertaining. Also moves too fast on its wheels, and there is no way to adjust the speed or brake the wheels. I returned.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|If you have read A Time to Kill, you will really enjoy this story. It takes place in the same small Mississippi town and follows Jake Brigance as he takes on yet another difficult trial.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This is a great app. Use it all the time. It is a must!  Y'all must get it buy now
1623650003|5.0|In &#34;Alex”, by French author Pierre Lemaitre (and translated by Frank Wynne), the title character Alex is kidnapped and it’s up to French police detective Camille Verhoeven and his team to try and find her before she comes to an untimely end.  Verhoeven’s life has basically been shattered by his wife’s kidnapping and murder four years previously.  Although Verhoeven wants nothing to do with any kidnapping case, his supervisor assigns him to Alex’s case ostensibly because another investigator is out of town and he’s short-handed.  What follows is a well-written, intriguingly plotted crime thriller that alternates between Alex’s and Verhoeven’s points of view.<br /><br />The characters in the book are all interestingly quirky or flawed in one way or another, and the book draws you in to their world right from the start.  Some parts of the book are somewhat graphic (although that seems to becoming more of the norm than the exception nowadays), so steer away if you have a problem with that.  And it seems that every protagonist nowadays has to have some sort of distinguishing characteristic or background (a playboy, fat, alcoholic, paralyzed, sees ghosts, etc.)  For what it’s worth, Verhoeven’s is that he’s extremely short.<br /><br />But I digress.  This is a strongly entertaining, intricate story that is well worth your time.  Five stars.
B00FEX2ZFG|5.0|I have been looking far to long for a really scary movie. Most of the new movies I have seen fall flat. I don't know if Hollywood is trying to play it safe nowadays or what but they just don't quite get to scary anymore. I love old houses and I love really good scary ghost stories and this is all of that. I love love loved the Conjuring. It is a scary movie. If you are a nightmare-after-watching-Scream type of person then avoid this movie. For everyone else watch it!!!
B00CPTUN5G|2.0|Be aware that halfway through an Eqestria Girl becomes quite demonic any may scare younger children.<br />My 4 year old granddaughter who LOVES My Little Pony videos was scared to tears. I was vey surprised that this was part of a movie for young children.
B00G8P2B4E|5.0|I liked Monsters Inc... not one of my favorites but an ok movie. I think Monsters University is way better. So cute to see the way Mike and Sully met and how they got where they wanted to be. I love that the movie followed through. It wasn't a disappointing ending at all but it wasn't a Disney everything is magically ok ending either. I would recommend this for people who have or have not seen Monsters Inc.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|To be able to stream video is cool. But to watch a downloaded video anywhere on my kindle without wifi  Rocks
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|We went and saw this one when it was in theaters. It is definitely adorable for the little ones. While the monsters do gross monster things (like eat scream cheese) it is very pg. My 3 year old niece LOVES this movie. This will be added to our Halloween line up for sure.
0385474547|5.0|A fascinating book from the other side of the missionary story.  What it felt like to be the &#34;recipient of those services.&#34;  It wasn't a positive experience for the villagers. Fascinating book/
B00EK0UBPU|5.0|This is a beautifully written book. It took a couple of pages for me to get into it, but then I couldn't put it down. I would definitely recommend this. Well done to Eleanor Catton!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This will go down in history as a masterpiece. I believe it will rank with &#34;To Kill  Mockingbird&#34;which is my all time favorite. John Grisham has created another winner.
B001MM28JG|4.0|Great classic parody of the Trekkie movement.  They shred almost every Star Trek cliche and Ms. Weaver gives us a couple of good reasons to watch this.  I still crack up at the laughing of the aliens.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Grisham is wonderful author.  Always fast paced and never too strenuous.  If you want a good beach book that will keep you enthralled, this is it.
0316322407|4.0|I got an insider's view and experiences in dealing with the Taliban and learned about the complex interweavings between the militants and the army.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|While holding some fascinating details about prison life that I never knew before, ultimately I was slightly disappointed by this book. Kerman doesn't do a great job of tying together the strict atmosphere of the prison with the flexibility she has to run miles around the track and be out-of-doors. I also got the feeling that she spent a lot of the novel trying to outline the differences between herself and the &#34;real&#34; prisoners.<br />That being said, her voice is strong, and overall she provides a comedic window into a world that most of us never experience.<br />I enjoyed this book, but it wouldn't be at the top of my to-recommend list.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|It's a familiar theme many books are written around...the old south. The plot is very well done, and the visualizations are ample also. I would like to read other material by this author.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Personally I had never read The Shining, so when Doctor Sleep came out to rave reviews I had to give it a shot. I read the two books back to back, and somehow I still didn't get enough of little Danny Torrence.<br /><br />It's fascinating to see how King's writing style has evolved since he wrote The Shining. He uses lots of character development in The Shining, and even more for each character in Doctor Sleep. A major difference between the two was that during The Shining I was terrified to the core. Near the end of the book I was childishly afraid to get out of my bed, scared a &#34;hedge animal&#34; might be lurking there. Doctor Sleep retains King's style of dark characters who struggle with various demons in their haunting histories, but the novel in itself wasn't &#34;scary.&#34; It was more of a thriller and did not invoke that same psychological terror that The Shining evokes.<br /><br />It's impossible not to love Danny Torrence in The Shining, so I was happy to discover where he's been all these years, even if it wasn't such a bright place.<br /><br />Highly recommend.
1476734941|5.0|I have been following the 5:2 diet for four weeks and I have lost 10 pounds.  I love not having to count anything the days I can eat, no points, calories, or carbs.  I fast on Tuesdays and Thursdays and found if you keep busy it is much easier. I do exercise 4 to 5 days every week.  The flexibility is wonderful especially during Holidays and special events. The most important thing I learned is your appetite does change, you really don't want to eat as much.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|It's pretty good. I like the graphics much better then on the computer. Just frustrates my that you cannot see everything sometimes
B009CPJHY4|5.0|One of the best movies I have ever watched...I loved all of it.  I especially love the title of the movie.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book made my heart break but it was worth it. It made me so angry and I still am angry and I hate Veronica Roth for it. But I love her for bringing this beautiful piece of literature into our world and my life.
B008XG1X18|3.0|This app frequently freezes, frequently has to force close and has glitches when pinning items. When it works, it is great. When it doesn't, it is an exercise in frustration.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|Not only is it based on a true story, but it is one of the best horror movies of all time. It is up there with some of the most popular and scariest movies ever.
B00CO4GO7I|5.0|I've already read American Sniper twice before purchasing the Memorial Edition.  It was nice to read the additional content written by family and friends.  It just further proves how much of a unique individual Chris Kyle was.  If only there were more people like him.
B000FC12ZA|5.0|I loved this book!  I hated to find out it was not all a true experience by the author.  It gave me lots of pleasure to read.  I liked giving up all the material things we consider not being able to live without.
B008JFUPPI|4.0|Quite a funny cool comic book movie (not read the comic book of this one though). Enjoyed it, nice effects and some iffy ones too ; D  ... Story wasn't bad but was a fast ride meaning you really don't get into any of the characters, R.I.P.D and anything but crack open a couple of beersor get a bag of popcorn and enjoy it for what it is, a popcorn movie.<br /><br />Glad I watched and bought it, did feel a bit too M.I.B but what the HELL :P<br /><br />4 Stars and a great fun filled adventure for 90 mins or so, oh would love though if DARK HORSE movies actually had a logo like flicking comics etc at the start like DC/WB and MARVEL movies do, also a Dark Horse logo on the DVD/Blu-Ray as most wouldn't even really know it was based of a comic book and not a poor mans Men in Black instead. So we need a Dark Horse Cinematic Universe please Dark Horse/Universal!<br /><br />Don't think we're get a sequel to this one, though could make a cool TV series maybe, next stop HELLBOY 3 fingers crossed.
B000B7HZXM|5.0|My husband and I love Rod Stewart's voice.  We are so happy he is singing those great American classics.  We can relate to all those lovely songs.
067144901X|5.0|Adorable. My 6 mth old is listening and watching very carefully as we read this book. A close second favorite to the Boynton's counting and barking book.
B00GH4R95C|5.0|Great story told well in limited time. This movie could easily have been much longer to effectively tell the whole story. Sound and special effects were good, but very reminiscent of the movie Battleship. Overall a great movie.
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|I don't know how I feel about this  book. Most of the action takes place &#34;off stage&#34;. I do enjoy learning about all the arcane tools & techniques always described in these books , but everyone is tired or sick or just out of sorts. Most of the book is an internal monologue by Kay , or a dialogue between Kay & Benton . There is a very heavy, oppressive  atmosphere, literally & figuratively . Obviously what Kay  et al do is depressing & heavy, but it just seems as if almost everyone ( Not Marino or Quincy !) is plodding along going through it all one more time. This is not a book to read if you are depressed , it will just drag you down with more descriptions of man's inhumanity to man, both imagined and real.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|only wish coins generated faster to give more play time. would also like to see more shakes in a smaller time frame.<br /><br />I could not find the Help screen
B00992CF6W|2.0|I've had pocket edition for a few months now and the game keeps freezing my kindle and forcing it to shut down anytime I play it. Going a future update will fix this!! Also there are a lot less options, for instance the crafting table shows I can make several colored dyes, but the items needed are no where to be found. Random things will suddenly appear and then never found again like mushrooms, but not all the types of mushrooms needed to make soup. Then you can kill all the sheep &amp; they don't produce more. They are just extinct at that point. The Xbox version is way better but this is still entertaining &amp; helps get you started.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|It's a fun game, kinda draws you in and before you know it you have been on for a hour or so.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Well written, held my interest. Characters seemed real to me. Good follow up to Jake's life after a time to kill.
B00BEK6Z7M|4.0|An easy 4 star rating, but to go to the 5 star it gets a little more complicated for me.<br /><br />Pendergast is one of my all-time favorite characters in books.  I have enjoyed every book in the series, some much more than others.  This one is a good read but somehow the great finesse of the character of Pendergast  is just a shade …..well, missing.<br />I do believe it may have been written with the idea of a movie.  There are certainly all the elements.  A mystery that includes many nods to Sherlock Holmes. Plenty of blood guts and gore.  A young spunky heroine the young people will relate too.  Even an Erin Brockovitch type twist.  This is a fairly quick read with no real surprises but I did get hooked and it had a tense action packed ending.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book and recommend it.  I am just a little surprised it took this long to write this book since nothing really different here.  Pendergast remains one of my favorites though.  He needs a protagonist up to his mental abilities.  I don’t feel that happened in this book.  Still, don’t miss it if you are enjoying this series.  I am glad I didn’t.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|Such a fun farm game. It's easy to play and cost no money. There are in app purchases but you can still play the game without. Only problem I've had is not being able to connect to Facebook. I love all the updates and fun challenges. Add me CUHZDHO.
B00EVW0SA0|1.0|Hands down the worst movie I have seen in years, the producers should reimburse me!  How did anyone manage to sit through this?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun to play, can be played on several devices, (phone, ebook, computer) and although frustrating at times makes you increase your brain waves and keep them young.

B00F880BWG|4.0|Why is this season dragging along? Every episode seems as if the lead character &#34;Rick&#34; is always in a daze. Are they trying to disconnect us? Maybe he's not going to make it to the next season.

B005D4YHN4|3.0|I love the way my Keens fit so I thought I would get some for my husband.  His footbed must run wide because the pair of Keens I got for him was too narrow.  Ended up sending them back. Bummer!
0307950689|5.0|Just finished this Dan Brown book, and loved it....I have read everyone of his books, and have enjoyed each and everyone of them....Hope he will have another book, SOON.  Thanks for offering used books.
B0002IVN9W|1.0|Not sure why this album got such rave reviews. I took a chance and bought it based on the reviews and now wish I could get a refund. They said it was the latest and greatest rock album. All I heard was a whiny garage band.<br />Even after three good listens, and I have an educated ear, there just wasn't anything there. If this is the best that rock has to offer, then rock is in big trouble.<br />I gave it one star for the album art.<br />San Diego has several up and coming bands that can blow the doors off of this whine fest band.
0802130208|5.0|Purchased this for our son and he has really enjoyed this book.  Great Price and Great Service!!!! Thanks for your continued excellent service!
B0013F1D02|5.0|A nice feel-good movie with humor sprinkled in here and there.<br /><br />The beautiful scenery is much appreciated.<br /><br />Recommended for anyone looking for a casual viewing.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Because I have great messages on it, and find it very rewarding to use. In my opinion it is excellent.
B005721W9O|5.0|This film is surprisingly good.<br /><br />Good acting, interesting plot, humorous bits.<br /><br />They look like they had fun making this movie, and you'll have fun watching it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A historic soap opera or drama, however it is extremely well acted.  The time period is very interesting as it takes place during the start of world war I.  This is a very tumultuous  time for England not only due to the war but also due changes occurring in society. The industrial revolution has come and it is the end for nobility.
B00GH4R95C|5.0|Great movie!  It was well done and gave a different slant on the other Superman movies.  Good acting with feeling.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Not a big user but good when I need it.  I'm not really adept at the facebook.  Something about everyone knowing my business is a little unsettling.
B00EL6ACOI|1.0|A documentary which only tells one side of the story is clearly meant to promote the film-makers bias. I watched this movie carefully, waiting to hear from trainers who would give &#34;their side” of the story… not gonna happen. We simply get the inconsistent and shallow comments of disgruntled employees. “I was young and didn’t know what I was doing”. “I believed whatever Sea World told me… how was I to know?” Then we hear the “scientific input”: Tilacom was kept in a small metal box which clearly would lead any animal to become aggressive. (I agree)… HOWEVER, later in the “documentary”, he is used for breeding, and this statement is made &#34;How could Sea World breed an Orca who is genetically aggressive”. HUHHH?? Are you kidding me? What a bunch of rot! As proof of his “danger”, someone snuck into the park and was killed by Tilacom during the night. This docu-dummary goes on to say &#34;How could they keep such a dangerous animal in the park?” Huhhhh… Are you kidding me?? A meathead sneaks in and goes for a swim with a killer whale, and this is Sea World’s fault?? We are told by an &#34;expert&#34; that Tilacom &#34;stripped the man naked and ate his genitals&#34;. I'm sure there is NO possibility that he stripped down by himself. Even the best trainers are NEVER to be in contact without a spotter nearby. We are further lead to believe that the trainers aren’t told of the risks involved and that the Orca Show should never happen because people can and do get killed. Huhhh… Are you kidding me??? Well then, let’s outlaw any activity where someone may be killed. Does anyone really believe the trainers don’t know of the risk? This movie has some very good points, especially the first 35-40 minutes.We see true atrocities in the capture of baby Orcas and the small poor facilities at “Sea Land”- clearly abusive. It then becomes a pure mess of a presentation- it is highly manipulative… It is a great film to study the effective use of partial truth in propaganda. Here's the formula- 1.Begin with unbiased INFORMATION and comments that are reasonable and informative 2. Gradually, throw in OPINIONS from the aforementioned &#34;reasonable&#34; witnesses. 3. Finally, cue the dark musical score, and present misinformation and bias based upon one-sided reports. Whatever you do, don't present any facts or testimonies from those who disagree with your propaganda. ...<br />Believe it or not, I am conflicted over the Sea World Orca shows. I'm not a &#34;Catch Willy and Make Him Do Ticks&#34; fan; however, I want to hear the whole unbiased story.  There are plenty of former trainers who would have presented the alternate view- I want a balanced debate- you certainly won’t get it here.

B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book was very moving. It gave me an inside look at what our brave men and women fight for everyday!
B0024O0VVS|5.0|I have the well known version and decided to get this one because when a movie Director works on a film he -in his mind- realize what he wants to create, his version, about the story and how he thinks it must be told using the audiovisual language and this decision -in the majority of the occasions- its free of commercial success expectations. Just thinking that a well artistically made  should be a good reason for a successful film... and its the audience who must escalade to his level. The same idea goes in the educational institutions (schools to universities)... you don't lower down what the students needs to know just to pleased them, no; they must reach the curricular levels which are prepared to get the most of each student. This version is pretty close to this conclusion. Certainly well recommended...Films like this are created once every 50 years!

B00CATSONE|5.0|I hadn't known how accomplished an inventor and engineer Tesla was until I read this exciting mini-biography.  It painted a vivid portrait of the man and his honorable behavior when so many of his competitors, including Thomas Edison, seemed to abandon honesty whenever it got in the way of profits.  This made me want to know more about the man and his times.  Well worth a read if you enjoy history and biographies.

B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Harden reports the inhumane conditions and treatments of Korean labor camps. That they're happening right now, makes them even more horrifying. This isn't a book for the faint of heart, but it's a story we need to be aware of.

B007URVZJ6|5.0|It is a great and compact book, which every author and wannabe writer should have. In fact, this guide could be used either as a source of reference or be followed as a step-by-step process in publishing your work in the appropriate form.<br />By all means, it is a very useful, practical and lovely read, which serves its purpose.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Up until Pixar started going sequel/prequel crazy in recent years (\\"Toy Story 3\\" was phenomenal, but \\"Cars 2\\" and \\"Monsters University\\" felt like missteps to me), I absolutely loved the studio's output.  They had a knack for creating extraordinary and well-constructed worlds in the most unlikely places, from a children's bedroom to a humble anthill to the Great Barrier Reef.  They weren't afraid to experiment either, venturing into more adult (though still family-friendly) territory with films like \\"The Incredibles\\" and \\"Ratatouille.\\"  I even loved \\"Brave\\" and the first \\"Cars\\" movie, despite most people considering those two of the weaker films in their filmography.  They just had a talent for combining beautiful animation with great storytelling and iconic characters.<br /><br />With \\"WALL-E,\\" Pixar ventured into new territory... the science fiction genre.  And in the process they created one of their greatest films, with a plucky and adorable protagonist, an all-too-real view of the future, and a message that's clear without being heavy-handed.<br /><br />The titular WALL-E is a cleanup robot, gathering trash on an abandoned Earth, tending his pet cockroach, and amusing himself by collecting interesting trinkets from among the humans' accumulated garbage.  His pleasant, if lonely, life is shattered by the arrival of a spaceship carrying EVE, a scout searching for plant life on Earth.  WALL-E is instantly smitten by the sleek, businesslike EVE, and when she finds what she's looking for and is taken away, WALL-E leaves his home behind to follow her.  The two of them end up on the Axiom, a starliner full of humans who live in ignorant bliss, completely oblivious to anything but fulfilling their most immediate needs.  But EVE brings news from Earth that will shake the Axiom... and uncover a conspiracy among the Axiom's robots that could destroy humanity's chance to return home unless WALL-E, EVE, and some newfound friends can stop it.<br /><br />As always, Pixar's animation is phenomenal, and the visuals of this film are striking and memorable.  Not only are the outer-space segments gorgeous and the Axiom's interior's appropriately sleek and futuristic, but Earth itself is given plenty of screen time.  And it's a shocking picture -- a polluted landscape cluttered with abandoned buildings and skyscraper-sized towers of garbage, everything rusty, decaying, and filthy from centuries of neglect.  The robots are all well-animated too, and given unique looks that set them apart from most Hollywood robots -- none are humanoid and only a few (most notably WALL-E, EVE, and the cleaning 'bot MO) have humanlike attributes such as hands and eyes.  WALL-E does bear a little resemblance to Johnny 5 from \\"Short Circuit,\\" but this seems to be mostly coincidence to me.<br /><br />The film manages to convey a great deal of its plot without being overly obvious about it -- much of the backstory is established through advertisements and the striking scenes of a desolate Earth in the first ten minutes or so of the film.  It's a rather shocking contradiction to see WALL-E going about his day, cheerful and content, amid the destruction and decay of a virtually wrecked planet, but it makes the film's message ring all the more true.  And when the humans of the Axiom slowly begin to realize that in leaving Earth they have not escaped their responsibility toward their homeworld, the message isn't beaten into the viewer's head but is there all the same.  It's a timely message, and one that the film handles very well, especially given that so many environmental films (\\"The Lorax,\\" \\"Ferngully,\\" James Cameron's \\"Avatar\\") are so heavy-handed in their message that they become hard to watch.<br /><br />One of Pixar's best films to date, this is a film for families and sci-fi buffs alike.  While it lacks epic space battles or aliens, it still has gorgeous images of the wonders of space, adorable robots, and an environmental message that's clear without being shoved down the viewer's throat.  Best for ages 6 and up.ed down the viewer's throat.  Best for ages 6 and up.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This is, by far and away, the best conversion of a comic into a movie.  Joss Weadon (the director) did a magnificent job of translating comics from the 1960s into a live action movie.  Script, acting, production are all first class!  I cannot recommend it highly enough.  Marvel studios appear to own the Superhero movie market.<br /><br />If you want to watch a comic book superhero on the big screen, you can't do better than this movie.  Buy 2 today.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is such a simple solution to steam video to your TV.  We watch shows on Netflix, HBO Go (there's no &#34;ap,&#34; but if you open it in chrome, it works just fine.)  The only thing I haven't been able to &#34;cast&#34; is amazon prime.  I love the ease of casting things from my phone.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|Was one of the many who got sucked into the series with no idea that Veronica Roth is a moron. This book, the final installment in the Divergent series, will leave you wondering why you even bothered to waste your time on them at all. Ms Roth admits on her blog that she didn't even consider her fans when she wrote the final book, that she was only thinking of the story, which by the way wasn't good. This book is really not well written and has no real resolution. Also, on her blog, Ms Roth says that she understands we're upset but she couldn't please us all. Well.. erm.. if you want to sell a book, you better please the majority.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I chose this rating mostly because it was too predictable and seemed a repeat of the first in a lot of chapters - still a good read
B003G4W49C|4.0|The story was very captivating.  I love books on the vein of post-apocolyptic societies...  One thing I would have liked in the book is for Orson Scott Card to have detailed more of the battle scenarios toward the end rather than glancing over them.  The climax of the book was slightly underwhelming.
B003DNH6DK|5.0|this is such a great movie. Renews my faith in society that there are good people out there! My kids all loved it too (ages 12, 10 and 5)
B000WYCF6Q|5.0|The mirror was what I was looking for. This fits my expectation although the mirror is small.<br />It is easy to install and remove.
B00CWVFZ8W|4.0|Read the books and liked them. The southern accents are a little over-dramatized, but all in all,  a pretty good movie!
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Was looking for a new season to watch through Prime and I stumbled across this series. I love it!. I have two more seasons to go!!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|A big downfall of the chromecast to me is that google took away the ability to stream local content. This makes this device almost useless for me in particular now so if you’re looking for that you should probably look somewhere else. For what it does do it does it well (netflix/youtube/etc). But it seems google is restricting a lot of developers from making this product a great TV/phone/laptop interface.
B0014JJ55W|5.0|A modern classic and must-own record for anyone who appreciates &#34;alternative,&#34; &#34;indie&#34; or just about any form of guitar driven rock. Some consider BTS as the progenitor of the sound made more famous by Modest Mouse (this is especially evident on MM's early recordings).<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with BTS or this album: the song structures are fairly complex and often rather long. The instrumental harmonies are built on layers of counter melodies. The comparatively rough vocals and lyrical composition are what make BTS sound &#34;indie&#34;--with a different vocalist and lyricist, it'd be close to late 70's southern rock. As-is, there is nothing sentimental or cheesy about BTS--their particular blend comes off as fresh (even many years later) and sincere with a little bit of jammy-ness without being off-putting to people like me that can't sit through a Phish song (for example).<br />I've bought this album in 3 different forms throughout the years--it really is a modern classic.
B00GHJ6BJW|1.0|It doesn't have the catchy tunes nor the interesting lyrics of her first two albums.  It just continued her downward trend of the third one
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Decided to try The Good Wife after seeing that it was on season 5 already, heard positive things. And I'm addicted...I watch one to two shows a day! It's like chewing on a piece of candy that's not meant for quick consumption...Good Wife is a pleasure to watch because it's smart/well written/assumes we're intelligent (tickles my brain) plus has great acting, but witnessing Alicia's decision over and over to stay with her previously-cheating husband is tough. Why does she do it? It's a puzzle that I can't solve. Why doesn't she just LEAVE him? He adds more stress to her life! She doesn't trust him! It would be easy to say she's codependent or has low self esteem...yet...she's an attorney. She's a good mom. She's a warrior for her clients. Why doesn't she stand up for herSELF? Or is she? Aaah! Infuriating! This show has it all. Like a dog with a meaty bone, even after you think you've chewed it clean, there's always something to gnaw on. And I'm no exception.
0394818237|5.0|great book for all ages.  I gave this to the grandkids a couple years ago and they still pick it as their favorite book.  Richard Scarry has several wonderful kids books out.  Love them all.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|As always John Grisham delivers a blockbuster story very well written detailed and keeps you guessing Right up to the end! It was difficult to put this book down I just wanted to keep reading
0740797719|3.0|A quick read that is a photographic viewing for beginners that gives an overall view of problems encountered when producing art but is lacking in technical detail.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Every bit as exciting as the first book can hardly wait until the movie comes out Jennifer Lawrence captures the main character with passion! A must read!
B00EZPCZ5O|5.0|Been following AFI since Black Sails, watched them develop their style and musicianship and heard their sound evolve over those years. Every cycle brings a change in this band and Burials stays true to that one constant; that said, those who might have been driven off by DU or CL might want to come give this one a few listens. Burials is its own creation but there are so many little segues to and from their past within it; Sing The Sorrow seems to have influenced a lot of it, at least to these ears, and the opening track feels like what Strength Through Wounding grew up to be after going through hell and back. There is not a single song on this record that I skip.<br /><br />Some of these tracks are like a punch in the gut. Havok described the writing as &#34;embarrassingly candid&#34; and this may well be the most direct record of their career. If you were there for the times between BSITS to AoD to STS, give this record a chance.<br /><br />DF for life.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|I love the fast paced story and the great steamy scenes.  The byplay between the characters is fun and a great lead into the next books.  I come back to this book often when I want a &#34;Calgon&#34; moment.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved this book. I just read the shining and doctor sleep back to back. Could not have asked for a better read. I highly recommend it. King really went all out for this book.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Got this DVD because it's a story that can be watched many times and still discover something new...anxious to get &#34;Red 2&#34; and hope that the sequel stigma doesn't apply to this continuation.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|My 16 yo suggested that I read this. She really enjoyed it. I liked it. It was a very good story, all the characters were well written and explained. I did laugh out loud and I did tear up a time or two, but I never felt that connection. The one that makes you care about the characters as if they were real people.
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|I love this battery, it's fairly small and works great. It's also a pretty good value for the money and charges my phone a couple times before it dies, so the claimed capacity seems pretty accurate. My only annoyance with it is that on my phone the cable is twisted when plugged in. The power connector on my Razr M is on the left side on my phone, not sure if that's standard or not.  Overall, I highly recommend this battery, and I love the quality of Anker's products.  Edit: The included attached cable started getting flaky and then quit working. However, I don't see it as a dealbreaker, as it just means I have to carry a separate cable with me, so it's not quite as compact anymore. I might just cut the cable off so it's not in the way anymore.
B00987MQRQ|4.0|I don't know how I came across this book but I'm glad I did.<br /><br />For the first half, we have the fictional narrative of Dr. Black, his musings, philosophy and descriptions of dissection. While clever and interesting, pales in comparison to the second half----the Grays Anatomy of supernatural and fantastical creatures. The knowledge of biology and anatomy, in general, on top of Hudspeth's creativity, artistry and thought put into the images is truly mind-blowing.<br /><br />I only wish that this book had been much more in-depth and longer. Instead of dividing the book into two parts, incorporating the anatomical creations through the 'biography' of Dr. Black, and make it a full scale STORY, rather than a brief sketch. However, being what it is presently, it's pretty wonderful.
014050639X|5.0|Love this book, have bought and given this book as a gift more times that I care to remember.  Always a hit!
B00BH0VSM6|3.0|This is my first introduction to the Harry Hole series and I'd never heard of it until I saw it at the library. However, I have read other police procedurals that feature foreign police protagonists.<br /><br />Any 'first' in a series tends to be rough at the edges and there is always something lacking. The Bat is no different. To begin with, Harry Hole, a homicide detective from Norway, has been sent Down Under to 'aid' in the murder investigation of a Norwegian citizen. While his role is only perfunctory, and under the close eye of the Sydney police and his Australian partner, Det. Kensington, Harry isn't about to fade into the background.<br /><br />The Bat is more character driven than whodunit, which is fine, and the description of Australia's variegated regions and people makes you feel like you're there--but that's all I found interesting about this book. The plot was bland and plodding, every chapter a piece of the puzzle, while offering a colorful insight into the characters and Australia's cultural/political/social/economic personae, the actual murder mystery fizzled quite quickly and meandered all the way through. There was zero tension, suspense or surprise and while I liked the main characters well enough, I wanted to read, at least, a semi-exciting mystery or one that didn't seem so haphazard and wandering. It has substance, for sure, just nothing I expected nor wanted though it was semi-memborable in a 'meh, who cares' sort of way. I will continue with the series and see where it takes me but The Bat was neither here nor there.
B000JMKTLO|1.0|First, I have to say that I read Gillian Flynn's three books, out of order (Gone Girl, Dark Places, Sharp Objects).  If I had read this one first, I would have never given the other two a chance. In all three books, Ms. Flynn, spends a great deal of time building the story, just to quickly wrap it all up in the last 50 pages.  Sharp Objects is the worst offender, as the mystery is quickly &#34;solved&#34; and resolved in a matter of minutes.  Also, by the time I got to this book, I no longer found her use of her favorite phrase, &#34;f-ing c*nts&#34; as shocking or appropriate.  It felt like a child saying a naughty word for shock value, rather than it being an important part of the narrative.  Overall, I did not like this book.
B004LROUW2|5.0|I am a big Murakami fan, and this book did not disappoint. It's classic Murakami -- people leading everyday lives (some ordinary, others extremely unusual) that find themselves in some kind of fantastical situation.  More need not be said.  My only problem was with his ending, which left all kinds of questions unanswered and was just a little bit too tidily presented with a big red bow.  It begs for a sequel.  I hope he writes one!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's lots of fun and frustrating at the same time. Not as easy to go up the levels but fun.
B003JTHXN6|5.0|Either for your personal life or for your company, this book will make you think about your own purpose in life and how you want it to be transmitted in all the environments you interact with.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I admit to being a compulsive reader, but The Racketeer made me a truly obsessive reader.  From the opening chapter, though all the plots twists and turns, to the final (satisfying) lines, I was intrigued and enthralled.<br /><br />John Grisham is a master story teller, and for those who are already fans, you will not be disappointed.  For those who are new the the Grisham golden touch, I hope you can set aside a few days for a total immersion in fiction.

B00ARHAAZ6|3.0|I enjoy Sanderson's work, but I felt this one was a little simple. I notice it's listed under YA and I guess that fits. It's not nearly as good as Mistborn or Elantra
B00003JRCQ|4.0|I really like this version a lot. But I have always been disappointed in the actors for our two main characters. The father is superb, the settings wonderful. The sister Mary is a gem of an actor. One day they will make a new version of this very beloved story and I'll buy that one, too. Until then, I get my Jane Austen fix with this one and am quite satisfied.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I learned about an event in American History that I did not know about.  It kept my interest.  The ending was wrapped up very quickly and was rather trite.  It was a quick read.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|I have now watched this 4 times and will schedule it for twice a year from now on! I lived in Hawaii for many years and it brought back such memories, bittersweet at times, I must admit. The music, the scenery are right on. George Clooney is perfect for his part, funny and foolish and loving. Who can resist him? His oldest daughter (the actor) is wonderful too. I saw it first in the movie theater and then knew it had to have it in my collection.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I really thought this device would do more.<br />It works well for what it is, namely an easy to setup and use streamer from my phone to TV. But very limited. It only seems to stream Youtube and Netflix. As far as I can see, it is unable to stream my browser or other services such as Amazon Prime to my TV, and that is a real disappointment. Perhaps it will get improved functionality in the future.<br />So for now I will stick with my beloved Roku.

B0015DYIH2|5.0|To me, The Twilight Saga invited me to reevaluate the approach I'd taken through life.  Always trying to fit and never really succeeding.  Square pegs don't easily fit in round holes.  Suffice it to say, to stop trying to fit was the first step in discovering who I am as opposed to who I'm \\"supposed\\" to be.  Ken Keasey said, \\"We are all born individuals.  Society spends millions of dollars and all our lives to make us all the same.\\"  I have been given the chance to try this again and maybe get something right.  A Breaking Dawn in real life.  Cool, eh?
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|awesome piece of technology I can recommend anyone to purchase this product its simple to used and easy setup too.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Beautifully written story, evoking many relatable emotions about being a teenager in love for the first time.  The characters were well developed.
B00AFEY354|5.0|Logan Lerman and Emma Watson are amazing! The book is amazing, and the movie does a great job of conveying the message of the book without straying from the plot too much.
B002QRWJA4|4.0|Beautiful movie, wonderful update to an oldie.  If you like Phantom of the opera you will like this version of the movie.  One of my children took it with them when they went away to college and lost it.  We missed watching it so I reordered it for my collection.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|This game is so fun! It has very mature themes, and it can be very repetitive since there's nine different endings, but the storyline is so cool, and it's an amazing concept!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The amazing ending, a full circle. I could not stop reading until I found out why he hung himself. Grisham did this splendidly. All came together on the last page with a giant &#34;I see!&#34;
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book was really good<br />I absolutely loved it when annabeth and Percy kissed<br />It was so about time<br />They are so cute together
B005LAIH2M|5.0|It is very BD, very hi-res and HD, I like the version &#34;Uncut&#34;, very smart writer able to modernized and bring life into new dimension for a nursery story.
B00EL6AAEU|4.0|‘Seaworld’.<br /><br />Most people have been there, but even if you haven’t, you know what it’s all about.  It’s been the secondary ‘Disney World’ for years, decades, deemed the more respectable or educational family vacation spot by many for quite some time.  In fact, ‘Sea World’ has been my family’s personal favorite vacation destination for almost six years now.<br /><br />Honestly, I did not want to see this film because I didn’t want to be swayed away from a place that truly makes me happy.<br /><br />Still, ‘Blackfish’ has been garnering so much critical praise and has received such a warm welcome from audiences who have responded to its themes and its depictions of the perceived or assumed ‘real Sea World’ and so, with all the collective yammering left and right I decided that this was a film I had to see.<br /><br />‘Blackfish’ is honestly a very powerful film.  The depictions of these beloved creatures being torn from their families and being confined in oversized bathtubs is heartbreaking, and the way that their treatment is described and the way that Tilikum is discussed is enough to make anyone swear off an establishment like ‘Sea World’ in a heartbeat.  The heartfelt confessions from former ‘Sea World’ trainers, their teary eyed accounts, are very convincing (especially in the first half of the film) and the way that the evidence is built around the ‘case’ being presented really sways the audience in a particular direction.  To call it manipulative may not be entirely fair, considering that many of the points made regarding animal captivity really ring true and shouldn’t be contested, even by people who enjoy ‘Sea World’ (I mean, even before I saw the film I knew that containing these magnificent creatures for my own enjoyment was morally wrong), but the film does fail to paint a complete picture and really establishes its own agenda rather quickly.<br /><br />‘Blackfish’ is VERY one-sided, and it’s not ashamed of that fact.<br /><br />‘Blackfish’ tries to get to the root of the ‘Sea World’ problems by traveling back to the late 70’s, when boats were chartered and people were hired to rip infant orcas right out of the wild, separating them from their mothers and shoving them into captivity at an early age, in order to be trained from infancy to be entertainment for families.  This early footage and the testimonials by those involved (who didn’t have a direct relationship with ‘Sea World’) is very commanding and will move even the most stone-faced to empathy.<br /><br />Really, this is kidnapping.<br /><br />From this early point, ‘Sea World’ and their ethics are cast in a very unfavorable light and the image doesn’t get any clearer.  Instead, they go into the attainment of a particular orca, Tilikum, who was attained in the early 80’s.  Tilikum has a violent history.  Due to abuse from his own kind (the female orcas who shared his living space were dominant and would attack him mercilessly), he grew frustrated and basically became a ticking timebomb.  Then, while he was an attraction at ‘Sealand’, he did the unthinkable.  He killed someone.  From that point forward, Tilikum’s history is unveiled and his track record of unexpected violence and the supposed deliberate white washing from ‘Sea World’ in order to keep him (for breeding purposes) is exposed in full light, or at least the light the filmmakers wanted you to see.<br /><br />My issue with ‘Blackfish’ is not that I necessarily disagree with them.  In fact, I tend to agree with every stand they are taking, but the film becomes so heavily one-sided that it starts to lose some credibility with me, especially when these former trainers begin to show traits of unbridled bitterness.  I mean, if the circumstances were THAT bad, why did you stay on for so long?  Don’t say you did it because ‘no one else would take care of Tilikum’, because you obviously weren’t taking care of him (and couldn’t, from what this film attests to).  When one of the trainers goes on and on about how they would NEVER want their children to think containment of these animals was normal, I started to shake my head.  I mean, these are the same people whose eyes lit up when they were discussing WHY they wanted to job in the first place.  To make claims that the animals only made connections with the trainers for the fish they were tossing in their mouths also felt like a falsified jab, since it kind of contradicted the claims that orcas have a higher sense of emotion than humans and even betrayed the tears that the trainers themselves were spilling over the treatment of these animals.<br /><br />In other words; ‘Blackfish’ tries too hard.<br /><br />Still, the message being relayed is a very important one, and ‘Blackfish’ is a very powerful and well-made film.  I think that it is a good conversation starter, and that it opens the door for more discussion.  I do wish that ‘Sea World’ had opted to add to this conversation, and yet again, I don’t know if their comments would have been treated with fairness since the agenda of these filmmakers is so obvious.<br /><br />Now, the real question is; will I take my family back to ‘Sea World’?  Honestly, I don’t know.  There is no denying that watching these animals flaunt their power before your eyes is breathtaking and really a joy to experience, and the joy it brings to my children is unending.  While the series of events that bred a place like ‘Sea World’ is questionable and morally reproachable even, we are talking about events that no longer take place (the actual ripping of these animals out of the wild).  Those savage beginnings are no more, and so one has to weigh out those incidents before casting a disdainful eye on an organization that has made obvious growth since the 70’s and has even done some very charitable and wonderful work with injured animals, nursing them to health and even releasing them back into the wild.  ‘Sea World’ is not all evil and it is not all smoke and mirrors.  I wish that balance had been struck, instead of trying to sell ‘Sea World’ as a giant pack of lies.  Still, Tilikum’s history speaks for itself, and the whitewashing of his past is cause for concern.  These are truly tragic and obviously cautionary tales, and they should cause someone to really ask themselves how appropriate these parks really are.<br /><br />So, I’m still mulling over my overall thoughts, but the message and the conversation are not only clear but important.king care of him (and couldn’t, from what this film attests to).

B005LAIIKI|5.0|This is simply an awesome movie. No other word describe this movie better. Be prepared for some violent scenes though.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I am ready to see the movie now! The book was great and should be read first. would definitely recommend.
B004GYY714|5.0|I have been listening for a few days and I love it.  I basically only listen to one station, but the other night I was able to switch back and forth to other suggested local stations.  It's really nice, I have no complaints!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled Hosseini is a wonderful writer!  I have enjoyed all of his books, and am never ready for the story to end.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a great ending to a great trilogy. I will be sorry to see these characters end. I will miss each one of them. This trilogy is a MUST READ. Truly great.
B008602KQI|4.0|Good movie. Love the books. I hate the PG13 of the movie though. It's shaky in the fight scenes which I hate. However, it's a good movie. I'm ready for the next one.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Another good book by Patricia Cornwell.  I'm never in doubt that I will enjoy her stories.  Keep them coming and I'll keep reading.
160459201X|2.0|The writer should have called this book &#34;God and your Subconscious Mind&#34;. I was not looking to read about the writer's belief in God. I have my own belief in God and it is quite different from the writer's belief. I have no use for this book.I left it in a public place, may be some one like the writer will read it, and find it helpful.
B00AEBBADG|5.0|This is a Christmass gift for my husband.  I know that he would like it because it is his favorite movie.  I am so glad I found it on DVD.
B00EI4V3X2|4.0|I just got these for the PS4 after trying out the PX22. For some reason the PX22 had low volume even after turning it up to Max in the PS4 and on the headset, plus they really hurt my ears.<br /><br />Switching out to the Px4 was like night and day. The volume is much louder and the headset was extremely comfortable. What I like about the Px4 is that it plugs straight into the PS4 and not your TV like some previous headsets of mine. The sound is crisp and the quality sounds good. There was no hiss or crackling on my set and after playing for more than 3 hours and I had no problems.<br /><br />Cons for me were no Bass or Treble adjustments. There is a button for Presets, but since the button is on the headset, there is no way to know the difference between the presets except to do it by ear. In order to get the Mic to work you need plug a wire into the controller. This might change if Sony does another patch in order to get the bluetooth working, but I found it to be a minor inconvenience.<br /><br />I'm fairly happy with the PX4 and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a Wireless headset for the PS4.
B000055Y0X|5.0|Fast fast delivery. I still buy DVD's for my 24-yr-old son to remind him of an ESSENTIAL film knowledge. How fun for Christmas Eve viewing!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is a fun game. You really have to look and find the pieces. I would recommend this great game.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It is easy to use.  It was inexpensive. I am waiting for it to have access to more channels like Roku.
B00EP0KYDO|2.0|The various genres of post apocalyptic stories have long been my favorite bit in the world of entertainment media.  I thought there was a good story here, nothing original though. No stand-out performances or scenes.  This could been a pretty good movie.  Unfortunately, the decision to cast Jaden Smith was a poor choice.  The young man simply does not have his fathers inherent skills.  I suspect there are other very rewarding careers within the film industry which young Jaden can pursue, away from being on-screen, in which his father can pull strings and call in favors.<br /><br />My opinion is to take a pass on this film and pull out an old classic such as Soylent Green, When Worlds Collide, West World or  The Andromeda Strain.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just like the first one. Intriguing book. Didn't care much for the ending but intriguing nonetheless. Highly recommend it to all.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I learned more about the Orphan's of our country and what happened to them as I had forgotten about this part of our history.
B00AVY5RSK|5.0|Love Jane Austen novels, they make you feel like your living in that century and experience all the emotions of the characters.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Read all three books back to back twice! Highly recommend this trilogy!!!<br />Can't wait to see if the movies do the books justice :)
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love the way this game gives you so many options when you are playing. It allows you to plan what you moves will be
B00CNQ7CRI|1.0|It was truly annoying!  That she should have the same insecurities and other foibles at age 50 that she had 20 years earlier speaks volumes about her inability to mature and take responsibility .  Every time I picked up the book, I kept wanting to slap her and say &#34;snap out of it! or &#34;oh, grow up!&#34;  It took me a long time to finish it but finished it I did in the hopes that it would get somehow better . . . but I was sorely disappointed.
1585104205|5.0|I'm self-teaching myself Latin (although I took a short introductory course some years ago) and I found this book an extremely useful and enjoyable - but if you're working without a teacher, I'd recommend using this in concert with another, more traditional textbook. I used it alongside Wheelock's Latin, and the different approaches seemed to compliment each other very well. The strength of Lingua Latina is that it gets you reading passages of Latin straight away, and gets you used to comprehending Latin as you read it, without hunting for the nominative, verb, accusative etc, as you do using a grammar-heavy text book.<br /><br />The book is just as useful for boosting your vocabulary.  The index system, which leads you to the first time a word is used (where it is usually glossed in the margin with text and/or illustrations) is a stroke of genius, and it meant that I only resorted to a dictionary around a dozen times throughout the whole book.  Given there are around 1,800 words in the book, that's not bad going, and understanding words in this way really helps them to stick.<br /><br />Having said that, if you are self-taught, you'd better do all the 'boring' memorisation or declensions and conjugations alongside this book, as the exercises are a little lacklustre. And there are a number of times that I was glad that I'd been able to study the grammar in Wheelock in English - particularly the subjunctive - as Lingua Latina alone probably would have had me in tears. But with Wheelock behind me, Lingua Latina does a great job of allowing you to see these arcane grammatical concepts in action. Participles never felt so natural!<br /><br />The book itself is beautifully produced and illustrated.  One minor quibble is that Orberg puts indirect speech in inverted commas, which frankly seems to confuse matters. But if you know that that's what you're looking at, it's easy enough to ignore.<br /><br />All in all, very useful, and great fun to read.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I like it. i mostly use it for streaming netflix off my phone in my bedroom. The only thing i didn't like about it is that i have to plug in a power supply. i was under the impression it would go off of the tv's power. Still a good product, just a bit misleading.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I am enjoying this version of Castleville. I was excited when I saw this released and had to get it. I don't get a chance to jump on my computer to play the many Zynga games. Now I can take it with me. I have no problems playing this at all on my old version of the Fire HD. Thank you Zynga and Amazon for making this possible. Now lets see if Zynga and Amazon will bring out anymore popular games.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Moved a little slow after the crash. I liked it. I was sorry that he had to go to jail when he was clearly the one to keep the plane crash from killing more than it did!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I admit I was kind of pissed when Nick's father was introduced early on as (for readers only) a possible suspect.  I felt manipulated in a pretty banal way, and wasn't too eager to get back into it. When the novel really takes a turn--with a surprising confession from Nick--was when I jumped the shark and was no longer ambivalent about reading on. Flynn's a good writer. Her characterizations are fully realized and seem authentic, even down to the kinds of details that also characterize the dynamics of their relationships. The flipping narrations and perspectives, all in first-person, allow readers to empathize, but also engages in other interesting ways, for we are often as duped as the main characters are by convenient omissions of important perceptions and details. That Flynn is able to create characters who are, themselves, products of their own created narrative is what made this novel interesting to me. The simulacrum effect in doing this then becomes a larger message about media, perceptions of the masses that change with manipulation and appearances and finally, the cynical notion that making these stories an entertainment factory creates its own brand of violence.
B001ECDVKE|1.0|Awesome movie! It was a pleasure to see it again. So funny! Again with the word count? LOL Silly policy.
B000T433CO|5.0|This is an absolutely charming moving--a MUST watch for our family every Christmas season!  Cameron Diaz is quirky & funny, Jude Law is charming & vulnerable & the rest of the cast is superb as well! How can you NOT like a movie with a happy ending???
B0001932ZA|1.0|I love this movie! The more I watch it, the more it makes me realize what republicans want for our country.
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|I believe this rates with the best of any comic related movie. A great movie with top actors and great directing. The movie keeps its original counter parts along with great effects and just makes it a triumph movie. I normally never write a review on anything but I do like to review products and reading other reviews on this movie it seems to not get what it deserves. Great movie overall with great acting, effects and action packed from the start to finish. Take this movie as it is &#34;comic book related&#34; and the movie itself is right on with what its suppose to be. Great movie! Thanks for such a comeback on the superman series. This movie was much needed at least for me to get back on. Its like for people who were not into Stark Trek but watched the new JJ Abrams directed movies and you were hooked.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Love playing this game, it's just as good as the original Castleville on facebook. The guests are fun and challenging.
0060794410|5.0|Fast shipping. Great audio that helped me make wise business decisions.
006202406X|3.0|Allegiant didn't seem to have the same spark as the first two books of the series. The pacing was quite slow--and the additional characters weren't well differentiated. What bothered me the most, though, was the alternating chapters between Four and Tris. It's not that I dislike the format; I often think it's very effective. But in this instance, the voice of the two was nearly identical. I literally kept forgetting which character was telling the story (and would have to go back to the chapter heading at time!), and with alternating narrations, the voices should feel very distinct. In this case, the voice that came out was Veronica Roth's, not the characters.  Unlike other reviewers, I was okay about the ending. It actually seemed quite fitting and in character, despite how disturbing many people found it.
B000JCSBU0|5.0|Crazy, messed up, but truly an amazing and inspiring story. No other movie can compare, as well is this movie is nearly impossible to explain you must watch it to truly understand.<br /><br />P.S- The Trailer does NOT do justice for this movie
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|That is the only reason for the four star. After reading the glowing reviews I fully expected something like The Firm or The Litigators. I wonder why the red herrings. Refuse to say what -no spoilers here.  However, if you didn't cry at the end, you have no heart.
B008Y768XO|4.0|Hard pressed to rate this one more than 4 stars. It has it's good and bad points like most movies. Try it before you buy it
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Fun Gem game with challenges to keep you thinking, but not so involved you get wound up.  I play this as I'm winding down for the night or need a break in my day.  I've gotten board with so many other swap games and this one kept me engaged.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|I grew up playing with Legos and the Back to the Future movies were some of my favorites.  This model was very fun to build because it didn't have a ton of those &#34;fake&#34; lego pieces, only a few, so it actually took some time to build, which is my favorite part.
B007R9CCT4|5.0|Finally got around to reading this!  WHAT a book!  Kindle version is well done, no errors I found, well tabbed for Kindle.  Nas some commenting, i.e. endnotes.  A nice addition would have been inclusion of a Nadsat dictionary, with discussion of the terms - but you can find this online and transmit it to your Kindle.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Great suspenseful book for all ages. Keeps you trying to figure out the purpose of the trials. Keeps head spinning.
B000WCDBKM|5.0|A titillating story of deception, black desires, and running action! The search and the finding items of the hellish world unknown to the many, but is desired by the demented.  This is a great suspense movie with good actors.
B00BXHLM1K|1.0|I am not a fan of the metamorphosis that has been creeping  into opera for a number of years now! This DVD is the worst of the lot. How can one seriously accept Rigoletto and daughter Gilda to have the comportment, passion and tenderness as they shuffle about a Las Vegas casino while using an elevator to their respective destination?. There is no chemistry here and the power of the music is absent  Shame on those global intellectuals responsible for just such a  mess - Verdi would have never approved of displacing this great opera - from 16th Century Mantua to a post modern Nevada showroom?  Really now!
B00FQPHA0M|5.0|One of the best movies.  Will never replace what Christopher Reeve has when he played the role of Superman. This film took it to a whole new level.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|Not one of my favorite Eggers but still a good read. Interesting perspective on how technology is forcing us to lose our privacy in all senses of the word.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have had a BUNCH of people tell me about this so I bought it and it was totally worth it.
B005K17RU0|4.0|this is helpful for keeping updated during tornado season and also for winter storm advisories. I don&#34;t want to get caught in a storm. Also helps to know temp before you dress for the day!
B008CP6RWU|5.0|This collection is amazing. Journey has to be one of the best games of this generation and is a must play for gamers who own a PS3. It is an experience that should not be missed and one that I will remember. Flow and Flower are both very memorable as well and each of the three games has its own unique art/gameplay style. I had actually already played through both Flow and Journey before purchasing this and have enjoyed all of the extra content (especially the Journey soundtrack!). I would highly recommend this collection to anyone!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|The Avengers somehow manages to get the ego's of many actors and their characters in on place and make it work. The special effects are extraordinary. The acting is well done with only a few small plot holes.  There is even a sense of humor. This isn't a grim Dark Knight movie. This is a fun popcorn kind of action movie.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The Chromecast is an interesting idea: Stream content to your TV, from the internet, by means of your other devices. This is a pretty good concept except for one issue: it would be ideal if it didn't ALWAYS require another device, IE if it had or you could buy an affordable remote of its own.<br /><br />In terms of execution: The content designed specifically for Chromecast works well: Netflix, Youtube, Pandora, Google Music. I've notice that triggering the Chromecast via my phone works better than from within Chrome on my laptop. However there have been some glitches from each. I like how I can start something on my laptop and then later control it from the phone. A great feature is the ability to stream ANY tab from Chrome. This is a great idea but in practice it is laggy and a worse quality than any of the official content &#34;apps.&#34; Finally, the cross compatibility (Android, iOS devices, any computer with chrome) for setup and use is great.<br /><br />Overall the Chromecast is a good idea and provided at an excellent price, I just wish it had more content. The SDK, the thing content developers use to allow chrome casting, is still in limited distribution and I think this is why we haven't seen more apps. If every, or most apps had chromecasting this would be perhaps, THE tv streaming solution due to its price. Until then its another fun Google toy thats 80% complete.

B001F12J0C|5.0|I really like how it comes in a box to keep them all together. None of the bulky boxes for each movie. All slim movies in one box. Excellent action packed movies.
B000WC39SG|5.0|I bought  this Blu-ray of \\"A Bridge Too Far\\" to replace my video recording and DVD copies of one of the best war films ever made; maybe not the greatest but close to it! I've seen it countless times and will certainly enjoy it many more. The Blu-ray is without fault with a crisp video transfer and flawless audio and is well worth the money invested.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Soo disappointed in this book !! The back and forth between Tris views and Tobias drove me nuts!!!  The ending blech !!!!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I am a Grisham fan. I love books that are so good I don't want to put it down.<br />This was that kind of book
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|The game looks good and I would have given it a higher rating but I get frustrated with it because it does not let you play continuously,it is  difficult to navigate and it keeps  stop playing to get you to purchase something
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I LIKE IT'S VERY FUN AND LIKE EVERY ONLINE GAME IT'S VERY ADDICTIVE! I love how it interacts with my Facebook friends who's also enjoying playing.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|This app is really awesome! But you have to wait in between songs. There is not much of a choice of songs. There should be some way of converting your own music files into .mid files.
B00CEF014E|5.0|I liked this book so much I have read it twice now and still finding twist and turns that I missed the first time around. Dana is a character that I'm intrigued by and definitely want to know more. Is she crazy or not? I really don't care, just want to know what happens to her and her sister.<br />A must read, over and over again as far as I'm concerned.
B00GINENG0|5.0|I have a young adult cat and he is so big and this game is great can not wait for more..
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works great!!!! I enjoy using this app for my daily calculating need a. :) plus, it is FREE!! Who could ask for anything more?!!!
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|I was enjoying the game until it stopped loading. It tells me I need to update before playing again but my kindle doesn't show an update available.
B00F91SCXC|2.0|This was okay.  This movie has some good scenes in it.  Watch one episode of The Walking Dead if you are wanting to watch an end of the world Apocalypse Style movie with infected people/dead roaming the earth to kill you.  There are a lot of knock off Zombie movies out there that are trying to capture the success of The Walking Dead but only a handful that can do it justice.  This is just ok for a cheap rental but don't get your hopes up.  Acting is good but the movie left a lot to be desired.
B00GINENG0|5.0|I love this app. It is so fun! I like how tom can grow up and get older, but you can see a baby version of him
B009CPJHY4|5.0|It was real and strong people living a honest life, searching for meaning in their lives as they age.  The same journey as me.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The app was fun.it kept me occupied for hours.i would recommend it to all of you.so hi u h g  under ultimate
B0088EDMMS|1.0|I was disappointed with this movie.  It was not what I thought it was and too unreal for my taste in movies.
B00DJUPLY8|1.0|Not the worst. But not good either. Play all formats but hangs way too often. Using this one only because I there aren't any better options for my Kindle Fire.
B00G32TD98|3.0|slow and predictable...really not that scary of a movie.  I won't say a yawnfest but not far from it.  Just, meh
B004MC8CA2|1.0|I've reloaded the Bible and it Still will not open offline. Very frustrating when needed during services or where there is no WiFi.
B00E9A656K|2.0|Great graphics but it really doesn't do much. I loaded it for my little grandsons and it doesn't hold their attention.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|My daughter and I play this on Facebook well the original game and had fun we now both play it on separate profiles on my kindle fire HD
B00DWZHTOU|3.0|If you only want to be entertained, then think of this movie as a \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" then it's fun to watch. The plots are complicated and unrealistic, especially when the team planned an accident on a bridge with heavy traffic and had enough time to make a switch of a speedy car. Com' on... The end gets even sillier when the detective who aggressively wants to nail the team turns out to be \\"you know who\\"... It's corny and disapointing. But to be fair, I love all of the actors in the movie, especially mr Freeman. In conclusion, I'd be pissed having to pay $14 to see it in the theater.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|Since I downloaded this applications the picture showing upside down, I don't know what went wrong. I really want to use it but is always come upside down please an advise...
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Excellent follow-up on little Danny Torrance from &#34;The Shining&#34;.  Way to go, Stephen!  No way I was going to fall asleep.
B00ER23UYA|5.0|Diane Birch is an amazing talent. I love both her albums and highly recommend them to anyone. What a breath of fresh air, if you like Adele you must listen to this woman's music. Her set with Darryl Hall must be seen.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is fun and addicting! This is for those seeking a challenge recieving gradification when the tasks are complete.
B00E9A656K|4.0|Excellent game but needs a sell option for cars and upgrades.<br />This would give players more choices and chances to change cars
B00000D9TQ|5.0|Lots of my favorite tunes (from this artist) on one CD.  I have other music CD's from this artist to make up the difference.
160459201X|5.0|This book is a must-read!!!  The insight and wisdom that I have gained from reading this book has changed my life!!!
B0060D3BWK|5.0|If you are on the fence about owning this movie, then you should own this movie.  It's so cool and you really do want to watch it right now anyway so just buy this movie.
B00FCR3JQS|4.0|Celebration of the diversity of people that live in NYC.  Sometimes feels too skewed towards the oddest and too controlled by author/photographer, although I do find his heart to be in the right place.  Love to see what he's doing spur other less commercial like minded photo blogs for NYC and cities across U.S. - done by all ages, genders, etc.
B000FBFN0Q|4.0|This is a fun, entertaining read. I would give it four stars. This book would be a great beach read.
B00GH4R95C|5.0|Well done. Graphics and a deeper story line has laid the foundation for a mega franchise. I am looking forward to the next installment.
B008MEM24S|5.0|keeps my daughter entertained. she loves it. play it all the time. love it love it love it love it
B0082RHRHC|5.0|At the first, I thought this one is one of boring books.<br />However, as I kept reading it I indulged in the book. I am fascinated by Jane's love with Mr. Edward.<br />Who wants to learn true love shall read,this book.
B004H4XDBI|4.0|If you want closure for If I Stay, I recommend reading Where She Went.  It is a quick, easy and predictable read.
B002ROKQJM|4.0|Author rightly expressed what is currently happening in India. Most of the people are hungry and running behind money. Ready to do anything to acquire. No ethics. It is a true reflection.
0345803485|5.0|Love this book, waiting on the 2nd book to arrive, can't wait for the movie.  Its a love story with ups and downs.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This is a great show but it might not be every American's cup of tea. If you don't want to hear swearing, see violence or fornication this is a great show. Don't get me wrong, swearing, violence & fornication are lots of fun, but this is great, too!
B002VQ7PVS|2.0|Started slow but progressed nicely.enjoyed it very much.well researched.gave me MUCH insight on covert workings of even friendly governments,and how it really uses up people.
B0031RSBS2|5.0|The Jack Reacher series are so well written that you find that you must keep reading to find out what happens next. No such thing as 'I will just read to the end of the Chapter&#34;. You get to the end of the Chapter and you just HAVE to read the next one. Each one is different, each time the plot is different, but they are all fast paced and intriguing.
B00ESNE696|4.0|Too much going on in one episode...made me anxious;) Love the other seasons much better! Don't try so hard next time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Probably shouldn't have started it because it's addictive!!  But it's such fun and such a challenge.  Keeps the &#34;brain&#34; alert!  You can sit down and do a &#34;life&#34; and then  go on with your day...as  many times as you need a little break.  It's really fun!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Just finished reading the shining and part 2 doctor sleep. I really enjoyed meeting up with the ghosts of the overlook and finding out what happened to Dan.
0553801473|4.0|Great story, but I am ready for resolution!  What will happen to my favorite characters (Tyrion, Jon Snow, Arya, Samwell, Theon, Brienne and Jaime ?  That being said, I'll continue to read his novels till either they or I run out of steam.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|It is a really interesting, well written and acted show.  There are always surprises...and it is well worth the time to watch it!
B00ENNA62W|1.0|When I play the movie on Bluray I get no audio on my bluray player or my PS3. I exchanged it with another one and it still does not play any audio tracks. The only audio is for the special features and trailers.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love how this app allows you to write reminder notes for yourself that will be displayed when your alarm goes off. Also I love that you can use any song you have stored on your kindle fire for your alarm.
B00013BN4S|5.0|Some of the most emotional and beautiful songs Emmylou has ever done are on this album. Her voice is like a bird, a bird with tears in its' eyes. If you've ever lost someone too soon, Boulder to Birmingham may help you get through it.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|In my option this is Philippa Gregory at her best. You totally identify with the main characters and really care what happens to them all, plus pick up quite a bit of 15th century history of the times in England.
1400069289|5.0|Best book I've read in years. What the 'marketing world knows about you already' may have been a more popular title. It's a good book, easy to read. A couple of my friends are getting it for Christmas.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This is a fun way to spend a few extra minutes.  It doesn't take log to complete most of the tasks to earn more coins and crowns.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|The game is fun. But it is annoying to have to ask friends to help you move on to the next set of levels. Otherwise it is fun challenging gameplay.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Great game with smooth gameplay and an intelligent setup. It has all of the aspects I look for in an rpg. So far it seems like a keeper! The only issue I have encountered so far is occasionally an enemy will fail to generate, leaving you with nobody to kill and a ticking clock.
0920668364|5.0|I received this as a gift when my son was born.  My son and I read this over and over again.  I now give it to other new moms.
1579655327|5.0|Its filled with beautiful pictures that perfectly capture the essence of kinfolk and filled with great recipes. You won't be disappointed!
B00AHJL7BK|4.0|I like this app as a number puzzle. Overall, I like the layout, but the number keys are so close together my fat fingers end up hitting the wrong button just often enough to be a bit annoying (but not enough to make me stop playing).
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was the most emotional and suspenseful book I've ever read<br />It also showed romance and confrontation I also liked the finale
0142001104|5.0|Part of my work concerns training people to deal with students.. I found this book to be a valuable and exciting new way to do this. I have recommended it to everyone in my School. There is always a &#34;falling off&#34; period during a training course when students begin to feel bored, over-fed with information and generally diffident. This book helps teachers  to deal with that, and more importantly, it helps teachers to cope with their own problems of dealing with difficult students.But it is done with humour and understanding.<br /><br />Dolores Ashcroft-Nowicki
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Fun game to pass the time. Just wish you didn't run out of energy so fast. But enjoyable to play. I would recommend.
B00C5R71U8|5.0|Mr. Kahney delivers an excellent book that I've been waiting for since May - and I'm surprised to find the amount of detail that's included here. For those who are griping about lack of further detail, complete ID process analyses, etc., we got more than Apple wanted us to, that's for sure! This is a rare glimpse into the secret world of Apple Industrial Design and a clean and clear look at the leader in the center of it all. Thank you to the author!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game was challenging and a lot of fun. I would definitely recommend it ans would love to find more like it
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Following the plot of this young boy and his undying love for his lost mother was sheer pleasure.  I couldn't put the book down.
B00B2GK4KW|5.0|It was a little tricky to get started but once I got the hang of it, I realized I will really enjoy this piece of 'equipment'.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|Watched it to keep a James Bond fan company.<br />The same old formula.<br />Not too keen on the main actor, and was definitely glad when Judi Dench was written out of the script.<br />If you're a JB fan, watch it, but you may still find yourself missing Sean Connery or The Saint's Simon Templar (Roger Moore).
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King is one of my favorite authors.  I've read all of his books, and The Shining was one of my favorites.  Like others, I wondered what happened to Danny and his mother.  Now I know.  What a ride it was!  I encourage you to read the book, connect with old characters, and embrace the new characters who inhabit the world of Daniel Torrance. It is well worth it.<br /><br />I expect that, like other King books, that this one will become a movie or mini-series. I can't wait to see it!
B000BISBDY|5.0|Great selection of songs from a long and successful career of music. Great album, highly recommend for any Cash fan or anyone not familiar with his work!
B00GH4R95C|4.0|If you're a Superman fan, you'll like this movie.  The cast in this movie is excellent (Russell Crowe fan).  Special effects were good, but a few were fake looking.  I liked Amy Adams as Lois Lane.<br /><br />Recommend this movie.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|This is a very fast read.  The author really pulls you in.  Even though Dan Brown's books are very similar, I really enjoy them.  They are fast pased thrillers.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I like the familiar characters and the struggling side of lawyers..it takes a real actor and salesman to be a lawyer..<br /><br />In the end it turned out well..I love Jake and his family and how he cares for them and his honesty.
B00AHSGNJM|4.0|Bought this for my granddaughter.  This is her favorite movie of all time (so far).  It looked good on my kindle fire too.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|if you like Grisham this is a must read. One of my favorites.  Great legal theories which I love in his books.<br />I was sAd when the book ended.  I will read it again right now.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|A really fun game to pass the time. Very simple for anyone to pick up and play. Animation is pretty decent.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Works great as an alarm and timer for my Kindle Fire.  Would recommend it for Android users.  What else can I say but why is there a minimum word requirement for these reviews!
B001XV3LSS|5.0|First of all the movie is great! good acting, good theme, interesting in so many levels. And of course the picture resolution, the sound, the image quality excellent in my kindle fire hd. Absolutely I recommend the movie and also the kindle fire, what a great product thank you amazon for delivering top notch quality.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Character development is lost in many novels and action takes its place. Not with Grisham and certainly not with Sycamore Row.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|its king of confusing to start. The instructions are not that clear and sometimes the clues don't work as they should.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Fuun, fun, fun, fun, feo the whole family and very enjoyable when you jump the levels...All I can say is fun
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I loved the first two books, but the third was a let down.  The ending wasn't bad, but disappointing things happened along the way that could have been left out and still made the book wonderful.
0060229357|5.0|This is a Christmas gift for a little friend and I found the pictures cute and the book charming.  I am sure he will like it.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|Not as good as Swype, but it's useful for those who like typing with both hands. Highely rated on the marketplace, but not suited to my style.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I really enjoyed the first two books of this series but, unfortunately, I don't think the conclusion of the series lives up to its predecessors. I have to look to the Harry Potter series for a comparison. What Rowling did so brilliantly is to gradually expand the size of the characters' world and the weight of their problems, which mirrors the typical process of children becoming young adults. Allegiant takes a very big and sudden plot twist- that the inhabitants of the city were actually placed there by an outside party for unknown reasons- and attempts to resolve the characters' reaction to that knowledge and how it effects their relationships in a VERY short amount of time. I felt like Roth presented a complex and intriguing issue and then just hurried through the end of the story without adequately exploring it. This series could EASILY have had a fourth book and probably would have benefited from it. It felt very much as though Roth was worried that her readers would lose patience with her if she slowed her pace at all, even if it meant a better story. I say you're not doing your readers any service to assume they can't handle a thoroughly told story. I mean, if a kid is bothering to read in this day and age, you have to give them some credit for having a decent attention span!<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: I didn't totally understand why Roth killed off Tris, but I'll go with it. What I REALLY don't buy is that the crazy stunt these kids pull at the end to save Chicago could solve the problem. After all, the genetic division is ONE part of the government. It's very naive to think that just because they blow a few things up and kill a few people that government would automatically say &#34;Oh, you're right, we should totally nix all these wacko experiments we're doing. Thanks, kids!&#34;. I say again: this series needed another book (or a longer third installation) and more thoughtful treatment of the story.
B0035HKWM6|4.0|Its a funny movie that was awesome when it came out and its great to come back to and watch every so often.
B00BG4RLF6|5.0|This beautiful collection, which attracted my attention when the 2nd episode of &#34;Masters of Sex&#34; (on Showtime) ended with the 5th song on the CD, Retrograde, is NOT to be missed.  There are at least 5 other songs (such as the title song) that will really grow on you after a couple, or maybe just one, listen.  They are haunting, but not sad or melodramatic.  One of the best CDs I've purchased in the last 10 years, and I buy a lot of different types of music.  I also just noticed the New Yorker devoted a paragraph to him - so now we have ALL of the reasons to buy this CD / MP3s with no hesitation!  I will probably buy anything else he has available ASAP.
B00003CXAA|5.0|What can be said about this movie collection that hasn't been said already...Great was to KILL a rainy, snowy weekend!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Very fun game
B00BU1DH1M|5.0|Quite simply one of Rankin's best. Very hard to put down. Maybe Rebus knew more than he revealed, maybe not. Glad to hear that there will 'always' be a job for Rebus in Edinburgh.
B00FLNRN06|5.0|Totally worth it. Funny all the way through. Reviews in theater were so so, great surprise that it completely killed the critics.
B00G70J81O|5.0|The fighting scenes are extended. The ninjas fight has a round two, it's a bit more graphic but not overwhelmingly, however enough to show the &#34;best he is at what he does&#34; do it in a way the is respectable to his character. Totally different movie. Have to have to watch this extended version!!! Makes the movie a different animal.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Not having a preconceived idea or know what to expect when I started reading The Hunger Games, I was immediately captivated by the characters and the story.  I strongly recommend this book to anyone who can think outside the box and enjoy a good, exciting, read.  I hated for the book to end!  I cannot wait to read the next book.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|So glad I read this. It challenges the status quo but frees women to reach their highest potential, whether in the workplace or at home.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|It was very well written from the viewpoint of someone who has Alzheimers.It was a  unique experience for those of us who have dealt with loved ones who were afflicted with the disease.  It was a sad story but I'm glad I read it.  I will read it again.
B00GQZVC1Y|1.0|Unreal. So Amazon can let us waste money on all the other episodes but those?? Wow. Un real. Might as well not put ANY of them for sale.
