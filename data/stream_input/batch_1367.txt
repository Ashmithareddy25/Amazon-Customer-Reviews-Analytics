B0013D6LEM|5.0|Michael Jackson owned 1983. From his moonwalking performance during \\"Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever\\" broadcast on March 25 to the music video release of \\"Thriller\\" on December 2, his music filled every radio, TV and dance club.<br /><br />I purchased the MP3 album for my sons (ages 9 and 7). They are too young to have seen Jackson perform at his best but time does not prevent them from appreciating his music, especially the best-selling album of all time. I downloaded the album to my Amazon cloud drive and, then, loaded their MP3 players. Within a couple hours they were in socks, attempting to moonwalk across our wood floors.<br /><br />My personal favorites from this album are \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" and \\"The Girl Is Mine\\" (with Paul McCartney). So far, my sons' favorites are \\"Thriller\\" and \\"Beat It\\", the former because of its novelty (Vincent Price's haunting rap) and the latter for its infectious rhythm.<br /><br />I'm having a lot of fun experiencing the magic again through my children.<br /><br />My MP3 purchase was $3.99 for the entire album, an album savings of $7.62 compared to buying all songs individually. That's a great price if you can take advantage of it. I also recommend signing up for Amazon's Cloud Drive - a great way to buy and store your music.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.<br /><br />BTW: I also purchased [[ASIN:B00149C8BK Number Ones]], an 18-song collection of Michael Jackson's top hits. I added \\" The Way You Make Me Feel\\", \\"Man In The Mirror\\", and \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\" to my sons' playlist.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|I have read Ken Follet's other books and genuinely enjoyed them. Fall of Giants, not so much. It was like reading a history book, not a novel. The characters were not as well drawn as in his other books, and it was tough going to get through all the history and to try to put the fictional characters together. In his other books the fictional characters seemed to tell the story, in this book they never really came to life for me. I plan to read the second part of this novel, and I hope it is better than this.

B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Cinder is a compelling re-telling of Cinderella with a sci-fi twist. A re-telling that I absolutely fell in love with.<br /><br />I admit the cover intrigued me. Don't let the classic framework deter you. While inspired by the fairy tale,it anything but a fairy tale.Cinder is an extremely intriguing story of a cyborg Cinderella with more than one twist. It is a prime example of addiction. After reading this, I have come to the conclusion that it is unfair that I must wait a year for the next novel.
0062119044|4.0|We Need to Talk About Kevin is the 8th novel by Lionel Shriver. The format is a series of letters written by Eva Khatchadourian to her absent husband, Franklin, which are a sort of analytical reminiscence about their lives before the arrival of their son, Kevin, their reasons for having a baby, the prelude and then the immediate and long term aftermath of Kevin's actions on that fateful Thursday two years previous. The Thursday consistently referred to in italics is when Kevin murdered seven of his fellow high-school students, a cafeteria worker and a popular English teacher. Eva examines the events of their lives trying to ascertain if and how she may have been at fault for Kevin's actions, and what his reasons for them may have been. It is a very one-sided analysis that, at some points, will have the reader sympathising with Eva, whilst at other times she comes across as a selfish, self-centred, often thoughtless, opinionated snob. There is some black humour, but on the whole, the subject matter precludes this. It is certainly not an easy read, both for the subject matter and the writing style, which starts with long convoluted sentences, but the final chapters make it well worth persevering with. Shriver address many issues: the nature or nurture debate; the hysteria caused by school shootings; why people decide to have children; what constitutes negligent parenting; is there anything you cannot forgive your children for. The story is skilfully crafted and I did not see the twist at the end coming. Shriver effectively conveys the experience of the forgotten victims of these mass murders: the family of the murderer. The sense of tragedy is strongly communicated. This novel left me with an overwhelming feeling of sadness.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Nice game. Easy to play, kids love it. Definitely keeps them occupied while we're on the road. Good job on it.
B004WCTLNY|2.0|Who else saw the previews to this movie and were not sure how it was going to end before it even started?<br /><br />What did the actors see when the read this script that made them want to do this film?<br /><br />In the end it is a very confusing movie about the over-seers directing our lives and trying to get on the way of true love because it may have a negative effect on the outcome of others.  There is a mystery of all of the hidden doors around us that we do not see.  I was just sorry I did not find the exit door sooner.
B006OAB3ME|4.0|I agree with some reviewers Paul sounds old here.  He is old.  Some of the songs are also impossibly dated, despite his best attempts to revive them.  But I give him a lot of credit for this obviously sincere tribute to songs from a bygone era.  I believe the title is a cheeky statement to all the naysayers and to those who insist he stick to some formula.  Those of us in our 40s & over need to accept there's a time & place for everything & old performers have no business trying to rock on major venues just like in the old days.  It just looks pitiful (i.e. the recent Superbowl & Grammy appearances).  That said, I love \\"My Valentine,\\" and \\"The Inch Worm\\" rendition is the sweetest song I've heard in a long time.  I hope when I reach his age I remain as \\"sentimental.\\"  I see this work as a natural transition for him & an excellent effort.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is a great movie.  Great message, great story and finally some good acting in a Christian movie.  That being said, the only 2 things to note:<br /><br />1. This is a movie written by Christians for Christians.  There is nothing wrong with this but you should probably not drop off to your neighbor you are trying to convert.  This is not \\"The case for Christ\\", nor does it break any new ground.<br /><br />2. We, like most others, saw this is a group from our church.  After the movie was over and the lights went up, it was disappointing to note all of the 55+ age groups in the audience.  This movie should be required watching for young parents or parents to be.  This is where the message of this movie is really intended for.<br /><br />Even if the above does not apply to you, you still should see this movie if just to show the powers that be that we are still a large audience that will spend money to see Christian work.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Love it!  Classic gaming action with current power-ups as promised.  No issues on the Inspire at all.  I'm sure the kids will love it too....once I give them a chance to play :)
B00164CM46|5.0|I can sit back and watch over and over again.  There are so many great scenes.  It reminds of a British version of Pulp Fiction.  The humor can be a bit twisted.  I love the character portrayed by Brad Pitt.  His language and his acting are brilliant.<br /><br />The only downside is too many characters don't make it to the end of the film so there can not be a sequel made that would be worth watching.
B006W0QOF2|2.0|Ladies, don't even waste your time reading this review, much less seeing this movie. Take my word for it: It ain't your kind of flick!<br /><br />Being a female myself, it might seem a contradiction to make such a statement. However, my clear mind and good taste was swept away by a few well-written words -- words that came from film critics who loved this movie. Keep in mind what I forgot: if film critics love a movie as much as they loved \\"Drive,\\" you're looking at some kind of film noir, art house flick ... at best.<br /><br />Guys will love this movie for its violence, naked women and car chases. It's a macho mess of madness, fast cars, blood and guts and sheer machismo. Although Ryan Gosling is an antihero in \\"Drive,\\" he is completely immersed in it's bloody action.<br /><br />Forget that it's supposed to be a love story, because if \\"Drive\\" is a love story, then \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" must be a musical! It's really raunchy, but even worse is the wait for something to happen. Plan on napping through the first half while the action builds slower than a crusty oldtimer limping across a busy intersection with a geriatric walker --  you know, the kind with tennis ball legs. But hey ... you get to see a bunch of your favorite actors of yore perform. Actors like Ron Perlman and Albert Brooks, along with a brief cameo from Christina Hendricks.<br /><br />What pulled me into \\"Drive\\" is the words of my favorite critic, Roger Ebert, who said, \\"'Drive' is more of an elegant exercise in style, and its emotions may be hidden but they run deep.\\" Roger really let me down on this one. His elegant words are pure drivel about a movie that really belongs on the cutting room floor.<br /><br />Do what you want, but remember ... I warned you!

B0073PQ720|5.0|This film's intensity begins in it's silent moments... and makes what is said and done, even more intense.  A great thinking-person's movie.  As slow as it moves at times, it catch's you off guard as to how fast it's over.  I'm not a huge Gosling fan, but he did an excellent job with this character. It's a movie, where after seeing it last night, I could watch it again tonight.

B004HW7JMO|5.0|This was intended as a Christmas present for my son.  Both he and I have enjoyed the TV series, but he missed many due to working nights.<br /><br />He was delighted with the gift, and I was delighted with the price.  It was much cheaper than other places I looked for it and being that I use \\"Prime\\", it came in a timely manner even though I ordered rather close to Christmas.

0439023483|5.0|I first picked up this book after seeing it on a list of recommended books at the library. When I started reading, I literally could not stop. The feelings, the emotions, actions and stories of the characters are absolutely wonderful.<br /><br />I don't have a whole lot to say about this book, I just want you to read it. Please read it.
B006ON41FC|5.0|fun and addicting! lots of challenges to keep u entertained no matter ur age. also looks good on the kindle fire screen. bright and clear. a+!!!
0439023491|4.0|After reading the first book, The Hunger Games, I was looking really forward to the sequel. I LOVE this series by the way.<br /><br />Catching Fire starts off well with them going on their victory tour and showing how Katniss's rebelliion in the arena is taking effect in other districts and how preventive measures are happening in her own district to prevent uprisings and what not.<br /><br />*SPOILER*<br />I was kind of disappointed with the amount of action with Peeta and Katniss in the Quarter Quell. I really liked the thing with Pultarch showing Katniss his watch and connecting it with the theme of the arena. I understood everything that was happening up until Katniss's group meets up with Johanna, Wiress, and Beetee. When they start talking about their plan to electrify the lake I got confused. I'm not sure if I was reading it strange, or if it just wasn't making sense to me, but I couldn't follow the direction of their plan. Then Katniss gets attacked by Johanna and she launches an arrow in the force field and the whole area blows up.<br />*END SPOILER*<br /><br />The first portion of the book is better. It gets fast and throughout the rest.<br /><br />The first book will always be my favorite, but the sequel is pretty decent.

0307959856|1.0|I did not really expect this to have Jane Austen's voice but I did expect it to have P.D. James' voice.  I thought another writer may have been involved, as so often happens, but I can find no evidence from other reviews.  The writing in this novel appears amateurish and knocked out in a couple of weeks compared with the tight prose in other James' work.
B006W0QOF2|5.0|Although I was expecting a more action packed film, I was surprised to find a thought provoking drama. This movie proved to be an interesting study in the power of love and the extent one will go to protect those in its grip. Ryan Gosling's character, though quiet and shy, showed that he could do whatever it takes to save those he loved from danger they never should have been involved in. Circumstances can sometimes cause great tragedy. He not only eliminated all threats, but was able to walk away from the life he so desperately wanted, just to remove the imposing threat from those he loved. Very surprising.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I read this as one of my book club picks. I enjoyed this book and the authors writing style so much, I have since read Kate Morton's other two books. Although all were enjoyable, I fell in love with this one.<br /><br />Everyone has pretty much covered the plot line and literary contents of this book in their reviews, but I had to weigh in with my vote. I absolutely loved this book. It reads fast and keeps you enthralled page after page. I became attached to the characters, I despised  a few and I loved other! The storyline kept me guessing until the very end as the plot took a few unexpected twist and turns.<br /><br />The best way I can express to others how a good book affects me is --when I am finished reading it -- I may put it down, but I never let it go. This book will stay with me for a very long time.
B005K2XM94|5.0|Bought this to protect my kindle fire, it does that perfect. it is a no frills sleeve. if your looking for a holder and stand than this is not what you want. however if your looking for easy in and out and protection than this perfect.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved Mr. King's early books - his later books, not so much. The thing I loved about his early books (Christine, Cugo) was the characterization.  This book really delivered on that score.<br /><br />Don't be afraid of the length.  I read this book over a weekend (granted, I didn't do much else).  Fortunately, King's books are long (really works for his style of writting, and can't have too much of a good thing).  Unfortunately, it makes the books unweildly to carry back and forth on your commute.  For that reason, I was really looking forward to the ebook, but even when it made it on the NYTimes Bestseller List, the price was still bove $12.99.  Too much in my opinion, since I have a lot in my TBR pile.  But the library carried this in hardcover, and since I read it over a weekend, the heft didn't bother me.<br /><br />Great vintage Stephen King.  All about the characters, not about the horror.

1439170916|5.0|I don't remember when I learned the meaning of mortality but I'm pretty sure that ever since that day I've considered ways I'm scared of dieing. When Emperor first came out there was an excellent review in Entertainment Weekly that convinced me that this was the work I should read about my greatest fear. It is excellent. It is what it claims to be, A Biography of Cancer, and it reads like the most insightful, well written biography of any person I've ever read. It has pathos. It invokes all kinds of emotions, some that you'd not expect. It is broad in it's scope and it keeps you intellectually involved long after you put it down. Case in point. A year or so after I read the initial review in Entertainment Weekly I was reading a column in the same magazine by Mark Harris. He was going on about how he had seen a big Hollywood movie called Contagion, a complete work of fiction. He wrote how it, \\"makes a cogent case for a large, activist, well staffed government bureaucracy...(as) given a choice of where to place your faith, government isn't necessarily a bad way to go. Especially considering the alternatives the movie presents.\\" I think he is pretty accurate about how he, and many people base heady decisions on fiction. In Emperor it chronicles, as part of the true story of cancer research, what really happened when big government decided to create such a bureaucracy and spend its way to curing cancer. In the real world it became an expensive, harmful, giant fiasco. In my opinion we need to read factual books on significant topics like this if for nothing else just to balance with the fiction. However, the icing on the cake in this instance is the book is a page turner.
B00715SUI6|4.0|My boyfriend and I are surprised because we know a couple who went hog-wild over the first two PAs but hated this one.

1594203334|2.0|I bought this book thinking it would be a cute little story about the many cultural differences between French and American parenting - praising and questioning each. I had no clue it would be an all out assault on the American way, and full adulation of the French way. Even decisions that French mothers make like not breast feeding (which is medically proven to be better for the infant), the author praises. I would have been willing to take away much more had the author been more balanced.

B0031RAOVY|5.0|In late 2010 I happened across the movie \\"Hachi: A Dog's Tale\\" on the Hallmark Channel.  I DVR'd it but did not watch it right away.  When I did finally sit down and watch it several weeks later, I was blown away.  It does not get any better than this for a dog movie.  The fact that it was a true story of a dog who was so devoted to his master even after his master's death made it even better.  The casting, both canine and human was right on the mark.  I went out and purchased the DVD and have also enjoyed the 18 minute documentary on the making of the movie.  After watching this wonderful movie more times than I should have, I found myself falling in love with Hachi to the point that I wanted a Hachi of my own.  So off to Petfinder.com I went in search of an adult male Akita that needed rescuing.  I found a male Akita mix (amber and white coloring - same as Hachi) named Zeke that was picked up as a stray by a local shelter in St. George, Utah.  As I reside in New Jersey, I had to find a way to get him to me.  With the cooperation of a local rescue he was put on a direct flight from Las Vegas to Newark, NJ on December 7, 2010.  Of course his name was immediately changed to \\"Hachi\\".  I have not regretted saving my Hachi's life as his devotion to me is unsurpassed.  If you have not yet seen this movie it is a \\"must\\" for your bucket list.  I also bought many copies of this movie to give to people that were not aware that this movie even existed.  Shame on SONY for not giving this movie a theatrical release here in the United States as it went to movie theaters in every other country in the world.  Do we not have millions of dog lovers in our country?  Shame on SONY again for sending this movie straight to DVD with very little publicity.  I continue to educate my fellow Americans about the existence of this wonderul movie.  I am glad that Hallmark picked up this movie for the people that I cannot reach out to.<br /><br />And here is a bonus that no one ever expected .... On May 19, 2012, there was an exact replica of the original bronze statue of Hachiko which resides at Hachi Station in Japan, unveiled at the train depot in Woonsocket, RI, where the movie was filmed. My Hachi and I attended and to our surprise he was invited to be part of the ribbon-cutting ceremony. He was front and center in the newspaper article photograph as \\"a real-life standin for Hachiko\\". It does not get any better than this for me and my boy. Long live Hachiko in our minds and our hearts.

0425166805|3.0|The only thing that prevents this book from a better rating is that it is outdated.

B0052VUNHC|2.0|This book gives a twisted, unhealthy notion of what love and romance is. Travis and Abby had an extremely unhealthy relationship. There is nothing romantic about Travis beating every guy that speaks to Abby into a bloody pulp. Abby's reaction is to be angry at him and then to forgive him. Over and over and over. Travis was so possessive, needy and CRAZY that I kept wondering when his anger would turn on her. The only character in this book that even noticed how wrong their relationship was is Abby's roommate and she only says few sentences about it. She would be the only one that wouldn't be surprised if Abby was found in a ditch somewhere. This book should be titled \\"When To Run For Your Life\\".
B004O4K4SQ|3.0|Not really my style, but it is a nice game. Certainly is colorful. I only gave it 3 stars b/c I didn't like the control (or should I say lack of it). It seemed like the ship moved too much on it's own, &amp; there wasn't enough time to shoot things before they reached you.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I just started this book earlier this evening and I got so sucked into the story I stayed up until I was finished. The writing style was just so smooth and flowed very nicely. It was easy to get stuck in Sophia's world, plus the many twist and turns kept me guessing the whole way. With all the plot twists I just had to get to the end so I would know how it all turned out, honestly it wasn't anything that I had expected. This is a wonderfully written book with intense characters and even more intense situations. This book probably has one of the most normal romance's that I've read in a long time, no falling into bed on the first meeting it was a nice gradual progression into a more physical relationship. This doesn't make the love story any less intense or meaningful, actually made the story more believable more me. If you like to read paranormal romance then you need to read this story at first I thought it was a YA story but the girl in the story is outside of her teenage years which was a nice break for me. If I had to choose a classification for this book I'd say it sits in-between YA and adult and I feel it would be interesting for lovers of both genre's to read. If you haven't read anything by Rebecca Hamilton yet you are truly missing out.

The ending will throw you for a surprise for sure.  I highly recommend you buy this movie.  Fans of action, suspense, and drama will be very pleased with this selection.  I wish there was a novelization of the movie, it would be a strong read for sure.

Gosling's portrayal of the unnamed \\"Driver\\" is subtle and understated. All we see is his shell and not the creature he holds inside, so like the scorpion emblazoned on his 80s-era satin jacket. The supporting cast is superb, especially Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad) as his boss and manager, and Albert Brooks as the second-tier mob boss who invests in their NASCAR venture. Carey Mulligan is a stirring love interest, but it's all about the boys in this fable of \\"The Scorpion and the Frog.\\"

1577314808|5.0|Eckhard Tolle basically depicts that when you judge or react to a thought or a certain situation, your mind will interpret things in terms of the past. This means that your body and mind is \\"conditioned\\" to feel a certain way. This is the result of all your past history as well of the collective mind-set you inherited.<br />He mentions that we are not our minds and that our minds is just a recollection of labels with events and things we just associate with each other. (This is ultimately what causes us to react or feel a particular way)<br />So everything we see and judge through the present is actually through the \\"eyes of the past\\" and we get a totally distorted view of it.<br />Once you dismiss all the labels, associations, and the prior influences to your judgment, you will start to see the bigger picture of why you act the way you do, or think the way you think.<br /><br />Eckhard Tolle believes that once you observe and realize that the past is merely just a recollection of habitual thinking and experiences of what society inflicts upon you, then you can grasp control of what you do in that very exact moment. Thus surrendering to the present and seizing the NOW.<br />Mastering and actualizing this art will allow your own deepest self accessible.

0385534639|5.0|Loved this book! Rich characters and great visual images made this a book that was hard to put down. It was part mystery, part love story and full of adventure; our book group had a great discussion.[[ASIN:0385534639 The Night Circus]]
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|this is a fun app but I can only play it for a little bit or other wise it gets old
B0063IH60K|3.0|Its alright. Solitaire is solitaire. For free it is a great app. Gets pretty boring though. I do recommend it.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|This is one of my top 10 favorite games on my phone. The upgrades to your ship make you want to keep playing and the combo scoring makes you not want to die and rack up  highscores. On top of the there is decent variety in the levels and the bosses are fairly difficult. I would play for hours and not be able to put it down. Definitely worth the price for the amount if time you'll play it!
031603438X|4.0|First of all I must say that I didn't expect such a well put together book.  I also didn't expect his way of thinking. You may not agree with him but he's not the brain dead guy I first thought he might be. He seems to be quite intelligent in his own way of thinking.<br /> I was impressed with the information detail and the pure honesty that he diplayed about his good times and bad times and his way of thinking on all of it.<br /> I've played music on the road for many years myself and could relate to much of what he talked about, he just took everything more to the edge than I did.  You could almost hear his mumblings as you read the words. I loved it.<br />  All in all I've truely enjoyed the book, and I now will try a five string set up on a guitar.<br /> Mosley

B0041KKYEM|1.0|I place this movie in the \\"World's Worst Movie\\" category.  It was so hard to follow as it constantly jumped from reality to fantasy and back to reality and I was soooooo sick of the emphasise being put on her nails bleeding and the scratches on her back (and that the psycho girl needed to lose her virginity.)  I can't believe Portman won an Oscar for this or that the movie (on it's own) was reconized for anything.  I watched this on HBO and will NEVER PURCHASE the DVD, total waste of money.  TERRIBLE MOVIE.
B004HO6I2E|4.0|This movie is absolutely hilarious, but it had seriously crude humor (plus nudity) and not something I'd allow our kids to watch. If you liked any of the following movies, Old School, Bridesmaids, or the Hangover, then this movie is probably for you; if you weren't a fan of those, then you should probably pass on this one. Still, all things considered, my husband and I about died laughing in several parts and it really was a fun movie to watch. We are going to buy this one.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|In the last two months I've been devouring non-fiction as research to support my new project - a how-to book on novel writing, social media and independent epublishing. It's been an interesting journey and my final port of call was the much talked about million selling method book by Mr Locke.<br />The first thing I do when considering a popular book is to browse the negative reviews. Locke's knockers were scathing, claiming he didn't really reveal his secrets, that his method wouldn't work for most people and he was on an ego-trip. Then I took a look at the three star reviews (the ones that Locke himself discounts when he calculates the positive / negative review score of books). I sensed from those middling reviews that he was connecting with his readers. Not everyone felt they could emulate his approach but they began to give it credence. A sample of the higher scoring reviews showed genuine praise. So I One-clicked and slipped my few bucks into Mr Locke's bulging pocketbook.<br />First impression? An avalanche of advertising, branding and hammering out credentials. Close to sales pitch overload. I'm a bit of a straight-laced Brit and pushy product placement presses the wrong buttons for me. However, in between the lines of Locke's opening gambit, I sensed warmth and something akin to humility. So I read on.<br />It didn't take long before I realised that I was in the hands of a master of rhetoric. That's a positive super-power, when used for good. Locke's entrepreneurial understanding of sales and marketing, coupled with that gift for rhetoric, are a powerful combination. He's a rich man who has unsuccessfully tried to herd his ebook camels into sales heaven through the eye of a needle (or some more suitable metaphor). That was the first major learning. Money thrown at traditional product promotion won't propel an indie author onto the best seller list.<br />Locke went on to describe how his writing polarises readers and that demarcation defines his market niche. I read that on the day that Peril received its first ever one-star review. The reader had found my anti-hero thriller unpalatable, where others had lauded it. There, I had polarisation.<br />Donovan Creed, Locke's MC in his main series, isn't a regular guy and the quirky story lines aren't mainstream. Bells began to ring in my head as I compared the appeal of Creed with my Peril MC Ger Mayes. Locke has a series of Creed novels and that was where my hopeful comparison faltered (note to self - produce more!)<br />Then Locke went on to describe his GBL (Guaranteed Buyer List) and how these people have become personal friends who not only buy his new releases but are evangelical in spreading the word. I call them the Locked In. He explained his approach to social media and how he engages in a supportive social network where spam is anathema and everyone benefits, how he communicates personally and builds relationships. I thought of people I have met on Twitter, facebook, this blog and in chat forums. How they might have bought my book but I don't know. How I don't know if the 17,000 people holding ecopies of Peril even know that I've written and released The Baptist! I'm adept at the how-to aspects of social networking and epublishing, and I think I write a decent novel but, compared to Locke's sleek, tight and smooth machine, my marketing is a pair of old lady's wrinkled stockings.<br />All the way through the book Locke promotes his sound marketing plan but the major catalyst for his success, the trigger that set Locke's snowball rolling down the hill, is his incredible rhetoric. He attributes the initial rush of sales to a series of blog posts that hit the sweet spot with potential readers and went viral. The resulting sales success fed into his business plan with all its carefully designed components and he leveraged the momentum to great effect as the Creed series rolled out.<br />If you are an indie author who understands product marketing, customer relationshipmanagement and the principles of persuasion, then you have to read Locke's book. If you don't understand some or any of those things then you have to read Locke's book.<br />At the end I wanted to hug John Locke. And I'm not the kind of guy who does man hugs. I don't think that many people will be able to fully replicate his method. Few have the skill set, determination and work rate that he displays, but there are nuggets in there for everyone and I'm thankful to the man for sharing.

B007CGLRWA|5.0|This movie really exceeded my expectations with great performances across the board.  The depth of Brody's character, coupled with a brutally honest script that is beautifully executed by the director, Tony Kaye, makes for a constantly engaging movie.  James Caan provides for some vital comic relief to a film that deals with tough subject matter.  For me, the film exhibits how important it is to cultivate and maintain relationships.  If you like to be engaged in thought throughout a movie, you will find this highly entertaining.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This type of game is my favorite! I hope you make more! Space adventure, old west, New Orleans mystery.  Keep it coming.

B0067Q42BY|5.0|I enjoy this game, although I don't find it super challenging. it has a story line to go along with it which makes it more entertaining. for sure worth the $0 I paid for it :)
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|Watch this! Better yet buy it to watch repeatedly. Nothing has changed my view on food choices more. Both revolting and enlightening.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|This novel had me hooked from the first chapter. The characters have depth and are relatable, even though they are supernatural beings. I loved that Sophia is Wiccan, and you can see that reflected in the way she lives her life and how she deals with problems that arise. It isn't at all what I expected and I highly recommend this book!

B0040JHLM2|5.0|I will try to be a little bit different in my analysis.<br /><br />1) Read the reviews on several shoes and decided on either the Brooks GTS-11 or Asics GT-2160.  Gave myself a budget of $75.00 to spend<br /><br />2) Size could vary so I went to a retail sporting goods shop and tried both shoes on.  I normally wear a size 10-10 1/2.  They had a size 10 in the Brooks shoe and 11 in the Asics.  The Asics fit well but the cushioning did not seem to be as good as the Brooks.  The size 10 in the Brooks GTS-11 was just a little bit tight, so I thought a size 10 1/2 in the Brooks should be about right.  The sporting goods shop did not have a 10 1/2 in either, plus both cost $89.00 which was over my budget.<br /><br />3) Went back on line on Amazon and they had a size 10 1/2 available in the GTS-11 for $69.95 and a size 11 in the GT-2160 for $64.95 (color was not that important to me) I liked the feel of the GTS-11 at the store so for just $5.00 extra, I ordered it, and it was still under my budget.<br /><br />4) Delivery from Amazon was sooner than anticipated and I tried them on.  The fit was excellent ! I noticed how lightweight they felt and the construction of the shoe seemed better than the Asics.  They fit tight when tied, but do not cut of the circulation like some others.  I know these shoes are new, but they also seem to cover more surface area.  In other words, more of the shoe seems to come into contact with the ground, but they still provide plenty of arch support.<br /><br />5) For some reason I have problems with mesh fabric, especially on the top.  My big toe wants to dig into the top and puncture a hole into it.  A problem that I have had with other Asics shoes.  I noticed that these GTS-11 have some reinforcement at the top, but time will tell if they will hold up or not.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with this purchase
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|best game ever. I would have to say I really dont want the one you have pay 99&cent; for. love this game soooooo much.
0553328255|4.0|Time to start reading! The height of the books are about the size of a mechanical pencil + one inch and they are fairly thick. Its going to take you a pretty long time to finish these, money well spent.

B005T87QCI|3.0|this ap is ok. there isn't much to do... just punch peeps that are a robot. I guess Kt is kinds fun.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This game is great! I like a little bit of a challenge with this type of game and most of the clues had logical solutions. there's even a hint menu for when you get stuck. I am ready for the next game!

B000MNP2KI|5.0|To all those negative reviews about the timeline being screwed up, THIS IS BEFORE HE GETS HIS oo's licence. And they modernized it, and no sexual innuendo, he sleeps with the lady before he goes after the bomber at the airport. He sleeps with Vesper at the end, this is a beginings movie. I was skeptical when this movie first came out, but wooooooooooow. It jumped to the top of my list of all-time favorite Bond movies, in this movie we get to see why later on he doesn't trust women. The torture scene alone, which by the way. This movie takes alot from the book, including the torture scene. This movie was a breath of fresh air, after the waste of cellulodes of \\"The world is not enough\\" \\"Die another day\\".

1469984202|5.0|\\"Wool\\" kept popping up as a recommended book, and on a whim I purchased the omnibus edition. I am so glad I did. This is an inventive and imaginative story, told with skill and care.<br /><br />The pacing is perfect, nothing is extraneous. Even some of my favorite books have sections that can safely be skipped over; Wool belies that, and unfolds its story in a way that makes it hard to put down.<br /><br />OK, so maybe I'm not going to write for the NY Times Book Review. Just buy the damned books.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Lots of fun. I cant put it down!!! Fun to challenge my husband to see who can get the highest score!
B006MQRLSA|4.0|I don't usually watch movies about sports since I am not a sports fan.  However, this story seemed to me to instead be about how someone solves a problem they are faced with by thinking differently. Billy Beane realizes that given his situation, he can't solve the problem created by the loss of key players using the same method that has been used for the last 100 years.  Instead, he takes a wholly new approach and as expected meets with opposition from just about everyone.  To those who are already familiar with the Oakland A's and the result of his experiment, I guess the movie was kinda slow. I had no idea, so for me it held my attention. Although I don't like sports movies, I do like movies about creative thinkers who don't mind standing up for and holding onto what they believe in.
1592537251|5.0|Received this in a reasonable amount of time.  Book jacket was shifted about an inch so creases were off, but reset it and pressed for a day or two and is fine now.  Otherwise the book is in great condition- corners crisp, nice and white. The book itself is great, as a fan of the blog and group I was excited to get this book.  You could get lost for hours inside its covers.
0385342063|5.0|I was anxiously waiting for Sophie's next book to come out and couldn't wait to start reading it! But once I started, I couldn't put it down! It's a very light-hearted and fun read.

So good in fact, I am starting to read it again. :) Sophie, please keep your wonderful stories coming!

B0079NQZLE|5.0|Imagine this: a country is run by a totalitarian government, which occasionally selects groups of teenagers to methodically kill each other. On TV. Until only one remains.<br /><br />\\"The Hunger Games\\"? No, actually it's \\"Battle Royale,\\" a bloody and harrowing movie that came out several years earlier, depicting an alternate Japan where the youth are forced to kill each other. It's one of those movies that is strangely fascinating and filled with social commentary, with brilliant performances from pretty much everyone concerned.<br /><br />A class of high-schoolers are being transported on a bus, when they are gassed to unconsciousness. When they awake, they have electronic collars around their necks. A former teacher named Kitano explains that they have been chosen for the B.R. (\\"Battle Royale\\") Act, wherein teenagers are forced to fight each other to the death until only one is left standing.<br /><br />If you don't play, try to escape, refuse to kill or stray into a \\"death zone,\\" the collars explode. Each teenager is given food, water and a random item, and are set loose on a remote island.<br /><br />It doesn't take long for them to fall prey to suicide, paranoia, bombs and one student's brilliant efforts to hack the system. As the teens slowly weed each other out, Shuya Nanahara and his girlfriend Noriko try to find a way out that doesn't involve death. But if they refuse to kill, then they must escape the fascist nightmare... which no one has done before.<br /><br />\\"Battle Royale\\" (both the novel and the movie) was condemned in Japan for being so violent, and having a bunch of normal high schoolers killing each other off. But \\"Battle Royale\\" would have been striking even if it hadn't been publicized like that -- not only is it viscerally fascinating, but it asks the question straight-out: how much will people do to survive? Who would you kill to live?<br /><br />It also seems to be a story about how governments will oppress innocent people in response to the brutality of a few. However, the movie avoids any outright preaching -- instead it uncoils a tense plot, peppered with bursts of bloody violence, sexual assault and murder. There's a wild, frenetic energy to the story, and director Kinji Fukasaku unleashes it through every cold, bloodspattered scene.<br /><br />Fun trivia: Fukasaku actually lived through something almost as cold-blooded during World War II, when he saw children having to hide from bombs under EACH OTHER. The survivors had to clear away the corpses.<br /><br />Tatsuya Fujiwara and Aki Maeda really give outstanding performances in this story as nice, normal, everyday kids like the ones who live down the street, but suddenly they're faced with their friends and classmates... wanting to kill them. Takeshi Kitano gives a bloodcurdlingly creepy performance as Kitano, who is nevertheless given plenty of fleshing-out (such as a fondness for one of the students).<br /><br />Violent, creepy and wonderfully atmospheric, \\"Battle Royale\\" is a brilliant cult movie that takes a look at how far people will go to stay alive.

B003AO1SVS|5.0|There are hardly words to express my thoughts on this album.  I have listened to it at least 100 times through.  It's a mix of many genres of music - a very American album.  I think it's exceptional, deep, moody, etc.  There's not a song that I don't like, and, for the most part, they fit together perfectly.  I don't believe I could pick a favorite song.  It's my unquestionable favorite album of the last five or six years.
B0058VW36U|5.0|lots to do but hard to do. it's fun but you need skill to do the game. it's.sort of like a 100 puzzles!
B004L35GAQ|3.0|My favorite song on the album is \\"Sail.\\"  I thought that the album might be more like this particular song; however, I was wrong.  There are some other songs on the album that are good; however, I would not have bought the whole album had I realized how different the rest of the music is.  Actually, this reminds me of the album from The Verve Pipe with the song \\"Freshman.\\"  That song was completely different from every other song on the album, and, unsurprisingly, the only song not written by the band and the only song that achieved any mass appeal.  This is not as extreme of a disparity, but it's in the same ballpark.

I think I would have a heart attack if he wrote one good review for anything. all of his reviews are negative. must be nice to have time to sit play games and write stupid annoying reviews all day. get a clue, you don't have to download every free app, then write crap about it. its free get over it, don't like it uninstall and go on with your life. read other reviews before deciding to download yourself. get a real life.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Well I'm bummed! force close on open on my Samsung Skyrocket. I hope they update this soon, as it looked so good!
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|Favorite websites in one place. So nice to get current information on the same page.  Also you are able to add or delete with no problem.
B002RVZV9U|5.0|So interesting. From a guitarist's point of view, it is so fun to see how each guitarist developed their technique. I highly recommend this from a novice to expert guitarist. What a great flick!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|great app. really fun. gets more challenging with each level and its a great way to kill time. overall no complaints.
0385474547|4.0|We ordered Things Fall Apart for my daughter's AP History class.  I bought another book first with the same title, but it was the wrong author.  My daughter did very well on her test covering this book.  Thank you so much for the speedy, timely delivery.  I will turn to Amazon again when the need arises!
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|would be fun but this game crashes as soon as you try to launch it. tried reinstalling it but still the same. Droid x phone.
B001E45XT4|2.0|The mic pulls out but still not enough, you basically have to eat the mic to get any good sound out of it. the sound is ok out of the headphones. go to target and get a 20 dollar headset instead, works just as well or better.
B0013D6LEM|3.0|I clearly stand in the minority when I say that I found \\"Thriller\\" to be slightly overrated. Personally, The Jackson's  \\"Destiny\\", the percursor to Michael's quintuple of releases from \\"Off the Wall\\" to \\"HIStory\\", leading into \\"Off the Wall\\" is where the brilliance shines most brightly. \\"Destiny\\" didn't feel as crafty as \\"Thriller\\" did. Don't get me wrong, lesser celebrated songs like \\"Baby Be Mine\\", \\"Lady in My Life\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin'' Something\\" are classics in their own right. But \\"Destiny\\" early on heralded Michael's ubitquitous talents. \\"Off the Wall\\" astounded in its rhythmic acumen.<br /><br />\\"Thriller\\" became \\"the must have\\" album for the masses. The masses practically missed \\"Destiny\\". Though it sold 2 million units, it deserved to sell much more. \\"Off the Wall\\" sold 8 million copies.....four fold what \\"Destiny\\" did. \\"Destiny\\" was far more my destiny.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Smooth game play on TF201 and so far I've solved every two suit game. Nice undo feature and innovative tap makes for quick, fun play.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|this game is just to good and on kindle this game is perfect and super fast with no lag or problem loading.It my number 1 favorite game franchise of all time, this is the CALL OF DUTY of all touch screen devices.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|first the game is ok not great. second it is way over rated all it is is a sling shot and you use birds to kill pigs...over rated
B004O4K4SQ|2.0|Looks like a really fun tame, but like others said, it doesn't start up and had to force close. To bad.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is the best Bible app available. I have deleted all other apps and rely on the simplicity if life churches you version for my daily Bible reference.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|a good game if you have kids....also great if you can stay focus on one game and u like to gems hop.
B005I4JG80|4.0|Oh là là, les principes de laissez-faire raisonablement!<br />Ce livre m'a presenté exactement les paroles que j'avais besoin d'entendre.<br />Je n'arrive pas a comprendre pourquoi les americains sont aussi defensive sur leurs propres methodologies, malgre que ce livre ne soit quand meme pas une bible!<br />Je crois qu'elle voulais sincerement et simplement faire penser les peuples des Etats-Unis en montrant qu'il existe une autre facon de vivre avec les enfants, sans trop d'angoise, et toujours en meme temps de profiter des petits plaisirs de la vie sans la culpabilité. Bravo!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I had been following Ernest Cline's book tour for this book because of the awesome way he went driving about to get to each location long before I purchased it and read it.  I actually put off reading this because I really didn't want to be let down in some way and I'm very happy to say that I was NOT let down at ALL!
0446677450|5.0|Great book.. book was new not used as expected. will check back later when we are looking for more books by Robert Kyosaki.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|FC on start up on Samsung Galaxy Nexus running ICS, game looks great, I hope that they fix it soon
B0067Q42BY|5.0|A great game for fans of Mahjong puzzles. Lots of modes for every gaming mood. A little pricy at full price but extremely replayable.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I play it once a day at least...i I luv this game!! its cute and fun! that's all I wanna say.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a.fun game.and.I enjoyed.playing.it a Lot.and.my.kids lovebit.took so we have fun playing. it as a family. I highly recommend it
B004O4K4SQ|2.0|This is one of the very very very very few games I wanted and took as faotd, and the thing won't open. Nothing but force close, and on two different phones - thunderbolt and droid x. No other app has ever done this.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|This game really takes you back to the arcade days. It is very fun and I really like all the weapon options and upgrades available a you progress in the game. Great game to pass the time.
0374105235|5.0|This book was recommended by a friend, and I was a little hesitant to read it at first, since I was warned it would be quite emotionally charged. From the beginning, the author's writing style pulled me into the setting, and I felt like I was literally looking through his eyes. This is his story as he lived it, and it is awe-inspiring to see what he went through. Yes, it was sad and raw at times, but the story was so incredibly moving and educational, I am recommending it to anyone who wants a realistic picture of what it's like to be a child during a time of war. Superb Storytelling!
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Works great on the fire, must have had an update. Will enjoy playing while traversing through time and space in the TARDIS.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best Bible reading app by far. Ive tried others but this one has most free versions...including NASB which my pastor preaches from. Easy to use and add notes while listening to sermon. Wonderful access to so many different Bible reading plans. Thank you for keeping this free.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its pretty fun. you do not have to pay any of your money. I like it a lot. everyone. is different so if you like it you like
B0064BWE8U|3.0|I really wanted to like this. I've read a couple of other of Sophie Kinsella's and quite liked them so I thought I'd get on with this one but it just felt a bit strained, as if she thought it was about time she brought another book out. The story feels a bit contrived in places and the text messaging whilst fun at times wears a bit thin. I came to this because it looked like the culture clash comedies that I enjoy, girl out of her depth with the toffs type thing, and whilst very funny in places it seems somewhat padded out with bits that don't really have much relevance to the plot. If you like gentle humour then this certainly won't offend although I personally prefer David Luddington or Stephen Fry.<br />I read this on the ebook version and the footnotes confused me at first but when I got the hang of them I found they were the funniest part of the book
B004FOA84A|2.0|The game is too short to give it any other rating than 2 stars.  Its definitely not worth downloading, it only lasts about 5-10 minutes, if that.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|Optimized for high-end devices? I think not. Will not launch on Galaxy Tab 10.1. Uninstalled. Might try again if they patch the issue.
B000WZAE1I|4.0|The movie is really great, and this comes from an aficionado of fantasy and science fiction in all formats. However, towards the middle and end, whole lines of text are missing from the closed captions, making it less than desirable for deaf audiences who want to keep up with everything that's going on. I'd rather see less editing because I can read fast enough to keep up, and feel that slower readers should just read what they can, if they are that slow. Works OK for hard of hearing people if wearing amplification to catch the parts that aren't captioned.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|This CD of Scotty McCreery is amazing.  Watched him on American Idol, voted for him, and just knew he would win and be successful!  Love all of the songs on his first CD!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|It's better than the installed keyboard on my HTC incredible 2. It's almost uncanny how it guesses the next word for me. Saves me tons of time!
B0055EAJ7A|3.0|The 3D effects were not great.  I was not that impressed.  The movie was a little long and boring.  It was a little stupid.  Even for a comic book type movie.<br />I thought it would be better given the reviews.  I liked Captain America 3D better.
B003I55BIA|5.0|so good i couldnt put down the book! i love the chemistry alex and brittany because they are from different parts of town and are forbidden to be together! simone elkeles did a terrific job at this book!
B004SKIPXW|4.0|It's bloody, gorey.  Contains sex and lots of violence.  3D is pretty good as was the surround sound.  It is pure B movie plot and it seems Nick Cage likes these types of movies.<br />I would say the filming and 3D are not bad.  But be ready for the crazy plot, the sex, violence and language.
0375869026|5.0|Wonder is wonderful!  A great creation!  It is the story of a ten-year-old boy named August who was born with severe facial deformities.  He needed many surgeries and has been home-schooled.  Now it is time to start Middle School.  Should he be mainstreamed?  His parents disagree.<br /><br />Auggie becomes expert in knowing the exact milli-second a person notices him in the room, even when the person attempts to cover up the shock at seeing such a face.  We get several clues in mid-point of the book as to what he looks like.<br /><br />His favorite holiday is Halloween, because then he can wear a mask and no one knows who he is.  But something happens on this Halloween Day ....<br /><br />At first, I thought the whole book would be the P.O.V. (point of view) of this ten-year-old.  I was pleased to come to Part Two, and find out the author switched to his older sister's voice.  Via is starting high school and has problems of her own, including squabbling with her mom.  Palacio did a great job writing differently for these two siblings.  The other Parts include additional characters in the book.  In sum, this is one of the most excellent books that give different P.O.V.'s in assorted styles of writing.<br /><br />Natalie Merchant's song Wonder has this chorus:<br />They say I must be one of the wonders<br />Of god's own creation<br />And as far as they can see they can offer<br />No explanation<br /><br />The author RJ Palacio stated in an interview about seeing a girl with facial deformities and being ashamed of her own reaction.  She was afraid her younger son would say something rude so she rushed out of the ice-cream shop.  This scene is in her book.  On the way home, she heard Merchant's song, thus the idea for Wonder was born.<br /><br />Wonder is geared toward middle schoolers, but will appeal to YAs and adults too.  It should be nominated for and even win the Newbery Award.
B005IZLPME|4.0|I liked it.  Similar to an Indiana Jones type of movie.  3D was pretty good.  It moved along with it's pace.  Not engrossing.  Heck, it's a comic book movie!
1591844096|5.0|Seth describes that the world has changed, and you cannot rely upon success by fitting into a \\"factory job\\". The irreplaceable position in this new economy is being a linchpin wherever we are. A linchpin is an Artist that makes art. According to Seth Godin, anyone can be a linchpin. A linchpin does what others are not willing to do.<br /><br />Seth talks about how our corporate culture and schooling have indoctrinated us that if we do strictly what we are told, we will be taken care of. If this might have been true before, it certainly is no longer true.<br /><br />He also talks about the tiny voice within us that pushes back when we are tempted to do something extraordinary. He calls this \\"the resistance\\", or the \\"Lizard Brain\\". I like to think of it as the \\"natural man\\" that would like us to be safely mediocre.<br /><br />Seth talks about the nature of art and how it is a gift. He talks also about the benefits of a gift economy.<br /><br />Being a linchpin always involves risk. A linchpin must produce the art and put it out into the world. A linchpin ships.<br /><br />There is a very good bibliography which includes books that I now look forward to reading.<br /><br />There is a great overview of some of the major linchpin concepts if you google linchpin manifesto.
B000066AXE|5.0|Having picked this movie up solely for the fact that it won 'Best Picture', I can say that going into it I hadn't the foggiest as to what it was about, where the story came from or any basis it had in reality. It seems, if some complaints are indicative of general consensus, that my clean slate approach was preferable.<br /><br />Saying that, I found the movie to be engaging and intelligent and the story completely immersive with Russell Crowe playing an incredible character, flaws and all. It wasn't until the final moments that I came to to the fact that the film was based off of an actual person's life. And you know what? All the better for it. I was able to appreciate the story and its events, and Crowe's portrayal without considering it conforming to the strictures of the real world. For me, film has always been a medium that embodied an escape from the world that we inhabit day in and out; on account of that, I don't mind creative licensing in the least in effort to best tell a story. A film, or at least a biographical one, is in its nature a flawed reconstruction of reality, if and only if one places those expectations on the film in the first place. On the other hand, if you can accept the fact that a film is more a director's vision than anyone else's, than you're in a much greater position to appreciate the movie.<br /><br />Ron Howard and all involved did a fantastic job, I recommend the movie to all interested in a good story; and would like to encourage everyone to go into the picture not expecting a true to form biographical account of a man's life, but a film, and it's an excellent one at that.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is so great I'm so addicted with its 3- d graphics and enjoyable fun this game will surley make you play. and there are only popout adds because the people who made the game want to know if you like the game and other people that want to buy the game
B005K17RU0|1.0|Does not work on Kindle Fire: blank screen after entering location. Tried clearing cache, reinstalling, and entering a different city, to no avail.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I am enjoying myself which is all I ask of a game. The rules are a bit small, but it is a phone screen after all. Be prepared to deal with non-traditional symbols to match, like the Greek alphabet. Good activity that you can put away and pick up later.

B0073LWEXK|5.0|Loved this game.  This is the second game I've played from this company and have enjoyed both.<br /><br />My only complaint is the save game data.  It's written to the internal memory of the device and can add up to nearly 25 megs.  I would love to see this fixed.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|I love that the d-pad can be used first of all.  No option to disable auto-fire is kind of a drag but the game is fun either way
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|This game brings back memories of galaga and space invaders but in a good way. I can't put this game down and its not overly difficult unlike the old school arcade games. Great game overall. Also the colors really pop and makes the game visually very appealing.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This has been an easy to use app. i have had no problems with it. It has accurate information. I would reccomrnd it.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Ok so on my Android Samsung Galaxy S II, I have TWO Plants vs Zombies game (yes I paid for both of them). The Amazon Market version (the one i'm rating on), and the Android Market Version. So, both Amazon and Android market versions do not have Zen Garden, Puzzle Mode, extra Achievement options, extra mini games, and many more! The iPhone version has it all. So now lets compare the Amazon version vs the Android Market version. The Amazon version has worse pixels than Android, and tends to freeze more from standby. The Android version has better pixels, but still freezes from standby.<br /><br />I just got an update for the Amazon Market version on 2/25/12, and nothing has changed!<br /><br />Bye Bye Android, soon to say hello to iPhone!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I bought this in 2006, when I was a freshman in college, and it arrived the day before a psychology test. Needless to say, I watched all of this, the second half on my computer in my dorm's ironing room because it was after midnight and my roommate insisted on getting to sleep. Forget the psych test, I was doomed. I was in love! I watched it again and again...and was able to convince a few friends to watch it with me, including a rousing 4th of July marathon.  These days, I don't watch it as much as I used to watch it, but I still love it.<br /><br />Now, let me tell you why...It is a beautifully adapted story with excellent acting.  The story reminded me a lot of Pride and Predjudice, but it was different enough to love its uniqueness. John Thornton is a very interesting character with a lot of pride and Richard Armitage is not only delicious as Mr. Thornton, but he excellently portrays this sort of dark but not really character. As for Margaret, Daniela Denby-Ashe does a great job showing all the qualities and changes of this characters.  The supporting cast is excellent.  The story seems a lot darker and somewhat political compared to Pride and Predjudice, and it has very depressing parts, but it shows a very believable and passionate story.<br /><br />That last scene...oh my! One of my favorites of all times!
B005UBNL0A|5.0|I never even had to use this really, i build computers for people and make money off this thing! I dont give a CRAP if people say  intel is better, this is the processor that pays you. Or you can pay intel, its your choice.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|I can and do watch this movie whenever I need a quick Jane Austin fix! I love the characters! Henry Tilney is absolutely charming and lovable and I love him! Catherine is sweet and innocent and lovely as well.  Northanger Abbey is the last Austen story that was brought to my attention, and I didn't think the story would be interesting, but I was proven wrong.  I love this story! This is one of my favorite interpretations of an Austen novel, although most of the recent adaptations are very well done and interesting.  Well done, Masterpiece Theatre!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Keeps my brain busy.  One of the better solitaires I have played.  Nice for just hanging out and listening to Pandora on my Fire.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|Pretty useless app because it force closes everytime on my droid x. Words to get to twenty blah blah blah
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible app is wonderful for anyone wanting to read God's word.  With so many different versions to choose from, you can find the best translation for you.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|Good headphones.  Sound is clear, no exagerated bass or anything.  Slight pressure point on the top of my head, might be the shape of my head, but massaged the head band and fits nicely now.  Out of curiosity plugged in my iPod Nano and it worked great with it.  Use it to watch movies late at night.  Wish the ear cups were a little bigger.<br /><br />5-2013<br /><br />About a year later the headset is deteriorating.  Pads are peeling and coming off the foam backing, and I HATE the trapeze monkey motion the ear cups are mounted on.  Little pieces of plastic break off of it.  This is not a quality product made to last, I should have bought something else.  No more Sony headsets for me...
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Kind of a lot of grinding is required but it was a nice change of pace from other games .
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Works fine on my Droid Razr. I'm sure I will be playing a lot. No force close for me. Like the upgrading aspect.
B0078YWDHO|2.0|I liked how the movie started, and climaxed. But I think it should've been about 20 minutes shorter. The ending sequence of the movie was unnecessary, and added no real value. I felt that the movie had no conclusion.
B006ON41FC|5.0|My son loves this game.  He finds it very enjoyable and entertaining.  I like it as well but if he is happy I am happy.
0385344228|5.0|This book was amazing. The novel was gripping and the characters interesting. I flew through this book in three days because I just couldn't put it down. The thing about the majority of this book is that you HAVE to enjoy things like Law and Order to get the most from the book. There are a lot of trial transcripts, and while I personally enjoyed them, I've seen reviews from people who haven't. My only complaint is that the ending, to me, was weird. I won't ruin this book for anybody, but when we reached the end of the trial and the book kept going I was a bit confused. However, the ending, as I'm sure everybody has heard from somewhere, is PHENOMENAL. It holds a complete twist that left me gasping, and (forgive me if this spoils anything) makes me question the future stability of Andy and Laurie's marriage.<br /><br />All in all, I would recommend this book to anybody who enjoys reading and/or a good courtroom thriller. You won't be disappointed!
B006ON41FC|5.0|I really like this game I be going nuts for it ;)... Cuz u know its a bout flying squralzzzzzz
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I enjoy. reading the Bible.  and now I know that I can take it to church. it will. help me find any book in the Bible. with out guessing. God word. is important to have a round
B00125WAXC|5.0|Sharing this historic subject with others was a wonderful way to celebrate and elevate Black History Month 2012.  The DVD  \\"The Great Debaters\\" from amazon was first rate entertainment.

B004O4K4SQ|1.0|This app force closed on my Motorola ATRIX 4G. I will change my review if this is fixed. Looks fun...too bad.
B003YOXIVW|5.0|Peter Gabriel's \\"SO\\" album is an absolute masterpiece in all aspects. He utilised the best session musos of the time (84' to 85') and recorded the album in a state of the art studio with a producer and engineer who's ears must have been made from gold. It was one of Manu Katche's first big albums showing his expertise in drumming (and still does) and thanks to Peter for introducing Manu to the mainstage of pop music. The musicality and lyrics are, even in the 2012's, at the pinnacle of brilliance. Just go and buy the album, you will love it !!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|totaly awesome game I loved it I cant wait to get the free points I am getting for this stupid review

B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Awesome game. Runs perfectly on my cm7 HTC evo. I've played this before, and was ecstatic yo see it as the free app of the day.

B005XQLBU4|5.0|Fun game. works great on the fire. Very addictive and fun. Simple to play hard to master. Buy this game
0307959856|2.0|I had to fight to stay awake reading this book!  Granted I had just finished reading The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and it's sequels (the Millenium Trilogy, which are fantastic by the way,) but this book just dragged on and on!  It finally got interesting at the end when it wrapped everything up---or maybe I was just glad it was over!  Boring!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|...because in the war between sleep and reading just one more chapter, I can assure you sleep will not win!  I am best described as a casual reader.  I typically only read 30-45 minutes a night before going to bed.  After reading Wool 1, I decided to wait a couple of weeks before jumping into the second book.  Lucky for me, the Omnibus edition came out and has allowed me to fully consume the whole series!  I immediately found myself going to the bedroom early just to get started reading more Wool and remained lost in the silo until well after midnight each night.  I read slow, so most books of this length take me weeks or months to finish with many breaks along the way.  Not with Wool!  Even at my slow pace, I consumed the Omnibus in a few nights.<br /><br />I'll make my review simple: The Wool Omnibus is the best science fiction series I've read in the last 47 years (hint: I'm 47 years old)!<br /><br />I can't wait for the silo prequel series to start! (and I've already read the sneak peak 1st chapter of the 1st book over on Hugh Howey's website)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a fun game. my little girl loves playing it too. I like how each game is different. very fun to play when you are spittle bored.
B00012QM8G|5.0|I originally had this movie in VHS.  Now glad to have it in a more permanent format.  This is truly Spielberg's masterpiece and a must have for movie lovers.  Everyone should view this movie, lest we forget what happened during the War.
0443069522|5.0|As any student in Gross Anatomy will tell you, IT' S HARD! And this book was required text for my class. I was hesitant at first but when I found it on Amazon for such a deal I thought I'd give it a shot. This book really helps.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|this game is so addicting!!!! I think it is way better than the origanal angry birds. you should toatally get this app. it is great for a kindle fire!!!!!!!
B005529BDK|4.0|Was worried about fc on Bionic after other reviews but ran great on mine. Wish it ran vertically instead though. Not a lot of vision with it turned on the side. Did not play very long so not much else to say yet.
0895260131|3.0|I got this book from a friend I can describe it as a fine book to learn some info about Islam, but as an Arab, normal American books or books made by Western about Islam I find it mostly very narrow studies due the limitation of the language,  because  the write  data is a study  based on the translation which is between his hand and 90% of the translations is made by Muslims as an example when the Koran speak about beating the women the Muslim translation add the word lightly, to make the Koran look like more accepted and not harsh and violent, therefore there is no translation can really be accepted to give you the real words with the real meaning unless it's done by someone when not lie to cover the errors and mistakes and problems in the books of Islam like the Koran or the hadith, if you ask me about the real book to read about Islam to learn and get real education, then I would advise you to get the book it's called [[ASIN:0982413726 The Deception of Allah Volume 1 (study in depth of Islam, investigating Muhammad and Islam, volume 1)]], I believe strongly it to the best of the best, a book backed up with reference and proves with real translation and know perfectly correctness.<br /> same time I would like to warn people from false review made by Muslims given one stars for any book as long it's exposing Islam without even buying it or reading it, the act and even the defense is based on deception the same as their God this is why advice you to get the book [[ASIN:0982413726 The Deception of Allah Volume 1 (study in depth of Islam, investigating Muhammad and Islam, volume 1)]] the name of the book  tell you all that the story, as we say in the Middle East you know what is in the letter from the address<br />ng Islam and how everything base for them on deception this is why we see Muslims given the deception review so they might stop you from buying it and reading it.
B005T87QCI|1.0|I wish I could get a refund on this game. the controls are non responsive and buggy. impossible to play.
0307593495|3.0|This, the last (at least chronologically) in the series, isn't really a Wallander mystery, but more of an epilogue to the series.  Although there is nominally a mystery, it's not really an official police case, more like what Kurt did on his summer vacation. None of the cast of characters from the Ystad police really show up, and Kurt is lead around by his nose for most of the book, rather than developing his own leads.  Two longtime romantic interests show up, but only to reveal their fates (which aren't pretty).<br /><br />It's clear from the start of this book that things won't end well for Kurt. On the other hand, he's always been kind of depressed, and with good reason--he's overworked, neglects his health in a way that is bound to catch up with him, and has no love life or social life to speak of.  Up until now, his dogged determination to solve crimes and his colleagues in the Ystad police force have been all that has kept him going (and kept his readers interested).  This book is merely the story of how these finally run out, and with them our interest in Wallander.

0316056863|5.0|This review is actually to encourage folks to listen to this book via audiobook.  Tina Fey narrates the book and thus, you hear every hilarious detail that only can come from an author telling you the story \\"first hand.\\"  I will forever be a Tina Fey fan because of this book.
B006UG90RM|5.0|First of all, let me say this album is astounding! Van Halen fans have waited so long for this! Van Halen may have wrote these songs a while back, but what's the harm in that? Eddie and Alex are playing great as always. Dave may be older, but he can still kick out some nice vocals. I was a bit skeptical when I heard back in 2007 that Anthony quit and Eddie's son would be a replacement, but after listening to A Different Kind of Truth, Wolfgang proves to be a nice addition to the band. This recording quality is great as well!<br /><br />If you enjoyed the Roth Era of Van Halen as I did, you won't regret the purchase. Not a bad song on this album! Great job Van Halen! Keep up the good songwriting!
B005D5EYHW|5.0|This book has made me a HUGE Tina Fey fan for life! I must admit that before reading (listening) to this book, I didn't really know much about Tina Fey. I knew she was a comedian, she was on SNL at one point and that she played a significant role in 30Rock.  That was it.  But, looking for something funny to listen to and from work everyday (audiobook lover), I went to reserve this audiobook from my local, public library.  The waiting list was over 100 requests deep (I'm not kidding).  After months of waiting, I finally understood the hype. I couldn't stop listening to this book!  I would find myself hanging out in my car at both my workplace and home so that I could listen \\"just 5 more minutes.\\"  She is funny (at times laugh aloud funny) and dispenses some great advice.  This book both inspired me and gave me a well-needed laugh every day.<br /><br />In this case, I'm certain the audiobook is better than the print version because Tina Fey narrates the audiobook. Her audio cues, along with her skillful writing, allows the reader (listener) to be in the middle of every story she tells.<br /><br />If you like Tina Fey, you will love this audiobook. If you are like me, you will listen to this book over and over again.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I think this is a great app. Yes the adds can get a little annoying but it think it's a great substitute for having 2 pay 99&cent; 4 the ad-free version. Also the orginal angry birds is way better than any of the nock off brands. tmThe onky thing i would change is 4 u 2 b able 2 change the order in which u throw the birds. That being said I think tho a great app and I will give 4 stars. I think Rovio Entertainment did a great job creating this app. I never get bored with the pigs taunting me.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|It's a nice little tool, compact and lightweight. I didn't realize it was made in china when I bought it and that's my primary problem with it. Other then that, it's doing the job but I don't think it will last long. Next time, I'll invest in a product that will more durable and long lasting. In the meantime, the smith's PP1 will work and I like it for what it is.

0399241523|3.0|This was a nice book, one of the first Anthony Horowitz -  Alex Rider books I read, but it didn't live up to my expectations. The end was completely UNREALISTIC, what 14 year old goes into space? Astronauts train for years to go into space and then they decide that an untrained 14 year old boy should go into a space capsule and fly into space. Of course, this drastic decision happens in maybe 1 hour or 30 minutes. Overall, the beginning captured my attention and it was quite interesting. However I think I'll read the previous Alex Rider books to see if they are better than 'Ark Angel'.

0545265355|5.0|This trilogy left me thinking about it ever since I read the last page of Mockingjay. It starts with Katniss entering the Capitol after volunteering for her little sister in the Hunger Games. She starts to realize throughout the series who she is. She sees the wrongs of the Capitol, realizes who she loves, and if she wants to be the start of something that would catch fire in the nation of Panem. It grips you with a deadly bloodbath and ends with Katniss trying to make a better country with the rebellion. I highly reccomend this trilogy to anyone wanting a great adventure, to realize the evilness of humankind, and to get to know a truly a inspiring heroine.
B006P3HXZG|4.0|Puss in Boots is a fun enchanting movie that features your favorite feline star from Shrek! There are many reviews that will give you details on the movie plot, so I will leave it to them. The 3D effects are good but not over the top. The movie scenes have good depth but nothing really comes flying at you or around you, everything stays within the 3D scene. There are some cool flyover scenery parts. But the movie preview for Madagascar 3 that comes out summer 2012 has stuff flying at you.<br /><br />What you wanted to know is what do you get with the 3D BD purchase? You get 2 movies:<br />1) Puss in Boots (3D, Blu-ray, DVD and digital copy)<br />2) The Three Diablos (3D, Blu-ray)<br /><br />There's a Chuck E Cheese coupon, Digital copy authorization code from ParamountDigitalCopy.com and a flyer for the Train Your Dragon stage tour. The authorization code took me to iTunes to redeem my code on a Mac after launching the \\"Puss in Boots.dmg\\" file and the file was installed into my movie library taking all of 5 minutes.<br /><br />Overall its a good value for what you get.
B000002KHH|4.0|If a person only knows 1 or 2 songs by Black Sabbath, chances are they come from this album, be it War Pigs, Paranoid, or Iron Man.  That being said, this is no pop album.  It's not like a band that has mostly heavy songs and they're only known for a ballad or 2, Skid Row.  This is Black Sabbath doing what they did best.<br /><br />The sound quality is what you'd expect from a Sabbath album, not a fan of their sound.  But, they make up for it in style, innovation, and good songwriting.  You can pretty much listen to this album straight through.<br /><br />War Pigs 7/10 I appreciate this song more now than I use to.  Whereas before, I only thought it was ok, I've begun to like it a bit.  It's pretty interesting in the tempo.  It starts with a slow doomy riff then gets faster, but not in a typical way.  The verses are mostly vocals and a drum cymbal with the rest of the band throwing in little interludes in between the vocals.<br /><br />Paranoid 8/10 is a solid track.  Nice opening riff.  Iommi during this time, certainly came up with a tone of good riffs during this time.<br /><br />Planet Caravan 7/10 ah the first ever Pantera song I heard was their cover of this.  I have to say I enjoy that one more, but that's because it's the version I'm most familliar with.  That being said it's a decent song.  Ozzy's vocals sound like he's under water or something.  It's a quiet song, with clean guitars and random percussion.  Good tune.<br /><br />Electric Funeral 8/10 is a slow and plodding song mostly.  Normally not a fan of this style, but they make it work here.  Plus this was new back then, so you didn't have a bunch of songs like this.<br /><br />Iron Man 9/10 mid tempo I guess.  It kind of also has an interesting pace to it.  One thing you can say about these guys is that none of their songs sounded the same, at least with this lineup.  Bands today should take note.<br /><br />Hand Of Doom 7/10 another solid track.  It's a quieter song, fairly sinister.  It sounds veryapocalyptic.<br /><br />Fairies Wear Boots 10/10 easily my favorite song on the album.  Nice build up kind of slower at the start, but gets faster during the verses.  Cool way to end the album.<br /><br />If you're new to Black Sabbath this is a good place to start.  You can't really go wrong with any of the Ozzy era albums, except maybe Never Say Die and Technical Ecstasy, but even those are decent, just not good places to start.  You could also try the self titled, Volume 4, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath or Master Of Reality, but this is really a good place to start.  Chances are you'll know a song or 2 already, making it more accessible.  Oh, and since I mentioned every other album, Sabbatage is also good.
B00006IXEE|1.0|I was so excited to get the Footloose movie as I was wanting my kids to watch it before the new one came out.  Got everyone together and put it in and it wouldn't play.  Kept giving me an error saying it was the wrong region.  I had never even heard of region codes for dvds.  I would think that would be something that would be pointed out when purchasing the item. I noticed now that since I complained the region code is on there so if you know about region codes I guess you're in good shape. I've ordered movies before and never had to deal with this problem.  When I wanted to return it, of course I had to pay the shipping and handling to send it back, which I didn't do, so now I'm stuck with a movie that can't be watched.  Good thing I wasn't out much money.  I felt it should have been taken care of considering when I ordered the movie it said nothing about what region it was for.  Not giving the movie a bad review just the company it came from!
0312576463|3.0|What bugs me about \\"Freedom,\\" and even about \\"The Corrections\\" (which I read first and haven't reviewed yet) is that we are introduced to characters who never show a true sense of love for one another.  Nor for themselves, now that I think about it.  Every character - whether family, friend, co-worker or even stranger - treats everyone around them as an object, never as a person.  An object of desire.  Of lust.  Of competition.  As a stepping-stone.  An object of status.  Someone to advance their career or agenda.  A punching-bag.  You get the idea.  Between \\"Freedom\\" and \\"The Corrections\\" I have read over 1100 pages of Franzen and not once did I ever get the feeling that a husband loved his wife, that a wife loved her child, that anyone loved...anyone.  I know one of Franzen's points in capturing the essense of 21st Century America is that materialism hollows the soul, but wouldn't that notion be more powerful if the characters had to actually struggle with this fact and fight those materialistic temptations?  Instead, what we have presented to us is a world where, instead of striving to love, we have characters who strive to avoid being jealous.<br /><br />Now, I will attempt to highlight the main issues I saw in the main characters; I intend to stay brief, as anyone who has read the book should find it easy to follow my points.<br /><br />WALTER:  I believe his story epitomizes the point in my first paragraph.  I never felt that he was affected by the loss of Patty's love, but rather jealous of Richard for being the object of her desire.  Lalitha was an object of lust for him, another benchmark of competition between him and Richard...he wanted the pretty young thing who idolized him just as Richard had many times before.  I did like how the irony of how his job played into the title of the book, as we had a man who became trapped in a job and hindered by circumstances, all the while trying to preserve lands so a barely-endangered bird could fly free...<br /><br/>PATTY:  The most unbelievable character to me.  Never saw her as competitive as was stressed endlessly in the book.  A competitive mother wouldn't let her son get away with the things Joey did.  In fact, I saw her character as so NON-competitive in every way that I could probably devote an entire review just to her.  But anyway...  Her character was also inconsistent...in the first several pages of the book, we get an entertaining view of a woman who is the Martha Stewart of her neighborhood, but those qualities are never brought forward again; it's like Franzen started writing about her and then changed his mind about her complete development.  Never once did I sense any guilt she had over Walter.  Never once did I think she saw Richard as anything other than a Rock Star with an active penis.<br /><br />RICHARD:  I am more forgiving to him because I didn't expect him to show genuine love; but, I would have thought that someone would give more consideration to sleeping with his best friend's wife.  Would a rock phenom with a no doubt endless supply of nubile, constant-aged attractive groupies really circle back to a semi-fling he had in college 20 years earlier?  I never bought that he really desired Walter's life.<br /><br />LALITHA:  Just thought I'd mention that I always though of her as Kelly Kapoor from \\"The Office.\\"<br /><br />JOEY:  Now, I kind of felt sorry for Joey (and Jessica).  I'm not sure how children could grow up with genuine human feelings after living with the parents they had.  So, I thought his story was more believable of all, except his tie-ins with the Iraq War contracting company.Now, I know many people have pointed out that Joey's parts-running scheme for Iraq contractors, while making hundreds of thousands of dollars, was far-fetched - and I agree.  But, I think Franzen had to take some liberties and incorporate some hyperbole to capture the essense of the mid-2000s and the hysteria surrounding the Iraq War.  However, I do think he covered that aspect of the decade amply with the LBI body armor factor in West Virginia.  It would have been more believeable for Joey to have been a lucky real estate agent or crooked house-flipper cashing in on the housing bubble, but I understand Franzen only had so many story arcs he could contain, and Joey's gig did tie-in with Walter's shady partners.  Joey did show some faint struggles with his emotions, as when he almost chickened out on selling the useless truck parts, but he did that out of guilt just as much as out of worry.  Did he love Connie?  Maybe.  Did I ever feel it?  Not really...she was just the opposite of his milquetoast mother and high-maintenance Jenna, which was fine by him.  After growing up around his family, I don't blame him for avoiding unnecessary dramatics and turmoil.<br /><br />JESSICA:  Didn't see much of her.  Was she supposed to be equivalent to the younger Patty as outlined in her diary?  Basically neglected and left to fend for herself.<br /><br />Again, I think this book is really missing struggles with human emotion to make its points more valid, believeable and significant.  The characters in \\"Freedom\\" never end up in a state of soulful fulfillment backed by emotional happiness.  There is never an active search for contentment, but only a reactive response to distress.  Rather, they end up in a sort of \\"path-of-least-resistance\\" lifestyle where their material choices allow them to pursue consumer decisions without having to feel sorry for themselves.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great games....some easy...some challenging.<br />you can.earn enough points to unlock other games easily. no pressure to pah money for points. some of the controls are difficult but for the most part they are great games to play when you're sitting around relaxing. my husband and I both have this app sk we like to compete...really fun. I like the mind games better and the puzzles while.he likes the games where you manuever around.
B007BLDFWG|1.0|I really tried to make it to the end of this movie cause I paid to watch it and I wanted to finish it>>>$3.99 can get me a gallon of gas>>> so I did not want to waste my money:) BUT I had to fast forward this movie just to get to the end so I could stop watching it. I cannot get the other reviews saying how great it was>>NOT!! DO not waste your money.
B007BDK3SS|5.0|Trial xtream 2 is one of the best apps I have ever gotten. it has absoloutly no glitches and it has amazing graphics and a ton of levels.
B004XJRQUQ|2.0|I am reviewing the product itself rather than the story because chances are you already have heard what a great story it is. Unfortunately the Kindle edition has some major flaws with the formatting. I went with 2 stars instead of 1 because it is readable, but that doesn't mean it is acceptable. The fact that the font size randomly changes from chapter to chapter and sometimes even within a chapter is extremely annoying. I can't understand why Amazon and/or the publisher won't fix this. Its a known issue that has existed for a long time now.
B007BLDFWG|1.0|This movie is so God awful it's not even worth the time I am taking to write this! Amazon should offer refunds for this load of crap.

B0041KKYGU|3.0|Bad Teacher had all the makings of a great comedy. Great storyline, great cast but the funny moments just weren't funny enough to make this a great comedy. Justin Timberlake had a couple funny moments, otherwise, his character was a bit of a bore. Jason Segal had some good moments. Cameron Diaz was the typical materialistic, selfish hot girl. Phyllis Smith, who plays Lynn, was actually one of the funnier characters. Paired with Cameron Diaz they made a sort of oddball friendship that got some laughs from me. Overall, it was a good movie, just not as funny as I thought it would be or should have been. Any man out there that thinks Cameron Diaz is hot will most likely enjoy this movie for the car wash scene alone.

B005IZLPKQ|3.0|OK, I know it's based on comic book...but the characters in this movie are such central casting cardboard cut-outs that even cardboard boxes can't suspend disbelief.<br /><br />Lots of derivative storylines here:<br />-exotic Nazis/supervillians (paging Dr. Jones...paging Dr. Jones) with super-technology that they are too evil to understand in exotic lairs<br />-underdog American GIs ready to give them what for...<br />-personal transformations, explosions, hints of romance...<br /><br />And prepare yourself for a lame ending that features multi-generational time-shifting and the promise of future sequels with other Marvel characters.<br /><br />I wouldn't want to have parted with full cinema cost for this, but not bad for a rental on a quiet and cold winter night.

0307949486|4.0|The first 100 pages were slow moving and the character names were a little difficult to associate with, but afterwards, it was a very good story.  The isolated setting of the family and mystery plot reminded me a little of And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie.

B005B19UPE|5.0|Sarah's Key was one of the best books I have read in the past couple of years.  The historical relevance makes it a very believable story and it really sucks you in.  I read in public a lot...mainly at lunch; so, I get asked a lot about what I am reading.  I always recommend Sarah's Key and always will.
B005JE7WKI|4.0|Tucker and Dale vs. Evil is a parody movie on a budget. It's well paced and well edited. Gory, in a cartoon kind of way, that is not particularly repulsive. I'll probably watch it again. The 4+ star review score is deserved. Lot of fun for this genre of movie.

Jones started the first one in 1949 and the book focuses on a mere dozen of the most successful -- his arguments are persuasive, comprehensive, and his style is most enjoyable. If you have any interest in the hedge fund interest, regardless of your bias, I recommend this book

B006ZDS7CE|1.0|When I first heard of her name, I thought let me youtube her and see whats the big deal so I did and wow I was shocked to find out how horrible this chick sounds. She sounds like a horrid cover of Amy Whinehouse. .  I have given about 10 songs a good listen really trying to feel what she is saying or her style but she keeps sounding drunker with each song. Her lyrics are mediocre (who isn't these days), her videos are her looking pretty unable to move her top lip which I think adds to why she sounds the way she does.<br /><br />It humors me that people will say, \\"you just don't understand her sound.\\" PAHLEASE!! It is personal preference and I think ppl has lost that this idea still exists. . .I give her kudos for having the balls to step our and put this mess out I do however feel her success is due to the people her dad knows because this isn't purely off of talent since clearly she has none.<br /><br />As I do not ever look down on anyone getting ahead in life I say kudos to the kid and hopefully for the ears of the poor souls who has to and will listen to her that she gets better because this drunken, \\"I'm too cute\\" sound is losing me in music today. . I wish for the days when real vocalists come back until then I will keep my \\"old skool\\" cds on repeat. . .god luck to this kid. . .she would make a great model.
B004O4K4SQ|2.0|was the first game I payed for on my Eris. Now it will not even open up on my Bionic.  So sad. really wanted to play this great game again.

B00006CXSS|5.0|This product was a gift for my grandfather, and I had it shipped directly to him for Christmas. It arrived before Christmas and in like new condition, he was very pleased. What can I say about the series itself other than amazing. The entire series is an amazing tale of world war two and what those men went thru.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|looked like a fun game but it force closes on my Droid X2 which isnt exactly a low end device.  fail
B0064NTZJO|4.0|...so to speak. For me it was kinda like Brian De Palma meets Collateral. Different from what is generally put out for consumption to the masses,with a musical score that matches the mood of the movie.<br /><br />My only complaints would be that the plot feels hurried at one point in the movie(don't want to spoil but you'll know when),when up to that point it had been 5 star excellent. Part of the ending also feels a little hurried as well as the fallout with certain relationships doesn't give as satisfactory a resolution(or lack thereof) as one might have expected. The very ending is acceptable,not fantastic. Overall I liked and would recommend it to those with a diverse taste in movies. For people who tend to stick with the typical recipes for genre conflict and resolution,it might not be for you.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|Force close on start up on HTC thunderbolt. Also not the same version that's on the market for some reason.

B003UESJH4|4.0|I know this movie has received rave reviews (including here on Amazon), but the I personally found the story a bit light.  As far as overcoming adversity, there are plenty of significantly more powerful stories out there, and I didn't see much evidence of Prince Albert's greatness in this movie.<br /><br />But the movie still deserves 4 stars because the acting is great.  The characters feel real and human, and they wear their emotions transparently, so that we feel everything they feel.  Colin Firth's face alone is full of subtlety of expression.<br /><br />Not one of the best movies I've ever seen, but certainly one worth watching.
1569242739|5.0|These recipes are absolutely amazing!! The vanilla cupcakes with buttercream frosting and sprinkles are a cure-all for any heart-sick illness including heartbreak, loneliness and regret.<br /><br />I adore these cupcakes!! The cookies and cream are absolutely amazing and so popular with all my friends! This is the first cookbook that showed me how easy and fun vegan baking can truly be!!<br /><br />I recommend this to any new vegan who misses their sweet treats! My boyfriend has egg and dairy allergies so this was an amazing find for him as well!! I love Terry and Isa.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|It's not surprising how polarizing the film is. It's one that takes some work on the part of the viewer and some people just don't want to do that. But if you occasionally like to see films with a little poetry and a lot of ambition, don't pass this one up. I'm not sure every bit works for me, but I'm glad movies that attempt to engage the viewer like this still exist.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|Yup I'm a Liberal so there ya go. I also grew up in the Finger Lakes region (Cayuga Lake) and own property on Seneca lake. All I can say is: this movie allows you to see what hydro-fracking has & can do & how utterly deceptive & irresponsible the gas & oil companies have been. It is sad but true that you really cannot trust the gas/oil industry to do the \\"right thing\\". They are not even (yet) required to disclose what is IN the fluid they use to hydro-frack. Since this movie came out, earthquakes have been scientifically proven to be caused by parts of the hrydro-fracking process.WHY on Earth would ANYone in MY area want to risk our beautiful clean water for the short term \\"benefits\\" of this process?? The money & jobs go to \\"OUTsiders\\". GasLand simply opens the way for discussions. Ones that the oil & gas companies would rather not be forced to take part in.As far as the Finger Lakes are concerned.......our wine making & other outdoor tourist activities are simply NOT compatible with hydraulic fracturing. Period.
0393061310|4.0|Jared Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" remains not only the best example of a book that takes often overlooked factors of geography and environment to make a case of why the world is the way it is, it remains useful as a way to look at the world today. I realized this after re-reading it after having first reading it 10 years ago that if I keep its emphasis on the natural world in mind, I can better understand why Russia behaves the way it does, why Germany has to bail out Greece, why China is rising (rare earths) and why the U.S. shouldn't be counted out. Still a masterful work by a masterful writer.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|PUSS IN BOOTS is a delightful film with great animation and a shrewd combination of standard fairy tales and original characters.  The story wisely avoids any references to the SHREK franchise and focuses on how Puss became a notorious outlaw.  The main supporting characters---Kitty Softpaws, Humpty Dumpty, Jack and Jill--are all well developed and original.  But it is Puss's movie with his flamboyant charm, his woeful doe eyes and cavalier bravado that fuels the film.  Antonio Banderas is purrfect as Puss; Salma Hayek is spot on as the perky Kitty; Zach Galiafinakis brings a sinister villainy to the conflicted Humpty and Jack and Jill are well voiced by Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris.<br />PUSS IN BOOTS is a film both children and adults can enjoy--original and one of this year's best animated movies.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|When I first saw this game I thought it was a kiddie game but I downloaded it anyway because I'm still a kid at heart.  It is very addicting and I play it all the time.  I let my teenage son try it and he played for hours.  I took my Kindle Fire to a family function and my sister would not stop playing the game.  I love this game.  Well worth it.  Great job developer!!!
B002RSDW80|5.0|I first seen this on TV not to long ago and fell in love with it. I only got to see the middle section but still. I had to have it and watch it often. It is inspiring, clean, and true. Why can't there be more movies like this one!! Don't hesitate to buy this movie if you like to feel good and be inspired.

0307592839|4.0|I never seem to agree with the panels that choose books for awards, and yet I still read the books they choose.  Maybe out of some obsessive compulsive idea that eventually they will like something that I like.  This book was another one of those books that the Pulitzer committee thought was worthy, but I'm not so sure.<br /><br />I did enjoy the book.  The writing can be downright beautiful and moving at times.  There were passages that really spoke to me, like the part in Alex's story where he talks about folding his love up smaller and smaller so that he is less and less affected by its intensity.  I could understand where a lot of the characters were coming from and going to.  I lived through some of the time periods mentioned and remember some of the changes in the music world, so I had some nostalgia there.<br /><br />However, it was incredibly confusing to start a new chapter and every single time spend half the chapter trying to figure out 1) what year it was, 2) who is narrating, and 3) how they relate to everyone else already mentioned.  This was incredibly annoying and definitely subtracted from my enjoyment.  I also felt that the last chapter came out of nowhere and didn't seem to relate to much of anything else except to pull a couple of threads together hastily.  And the \\"future speak\\" was not easy to read.  Oh, and I know almost nothing about punk music, so that whole theme was lost on me.  I think I recognized maybe 2 band names.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a good and enjoyable book, BUT does it deserve a Pulitzer?  Probably not.  Maybe it was a slow year.

B006M4RN3U|5.0|To everyone who thinks this album is excessively auto-tuned...I promise you that it is not. I had the pleasure of seeing them in concert at a college last night, and it was absolutely amazing. Some electronic effects and overlays to change the mood of the song, maybe, but not auto-tune. Nate's voice is extraordinary and completely real. They were so into the songs and seemed genuinely happy and nice. They are lovely people, and this is a lovely album.
B004RKXNDU|5.0|I haven't read this or any other John Le Carre book, but I just saw the Gary Oldman film of \\"Tinker, Tailor,\\" and I thought it was one of the best films I'd ever seen.

0374275637|5.0|This is a terrific book for anyone who has an interest in how we all make decisions. It is an intellectual look at why we do what we do in an easily readable form. The information is what I would expect in a college text, but the format does not need lecture to make it easy to absorb. My copy now has highlights and margin notes throughout, as well as personal  musings brought about by the content. I think I heard about this book as a recommendation on a Sunday morning talk show. If you thought then that maybe it would be worth the time to read (it is taking me many times as long to read as a novel), go for it. The curious will not be disappointed.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|One of the most used applications I have. I use on the Iphone, Kindle Fire, and Windows. It is very easy to use and accessible from many devices and platforms. The interface is user friendly and could be used by people with different levels of experience with electronics.

0143039601|5.0|Published in 1958, this book is a fascinating preview of the 1960's. Like [[ASIN:0140283293 On the Road (Penguin Great Books of the 20th Century)]] it is based on Kerouac's adventures in the late 1940's and early 1950's as he and his buddies helped create the counter-culture, migrating cross-country between bases in Greenwich Village and San Francisco. They hop freights as hobos (the end of that era). They talk endlessly about Buddhist concepts (thus Dharma).  Kerouac is credited with inventing the phrase \\"beat generation\\" but his group disowned it when the press turned it into the pejorative \\"beatnik,\\" precursor of flower children and hippies. So, Jack and his buddies hang out in San Francisco, partying and backpacking. A good part of the book is an excellent stand-alone backpacking story. You can always spot Jack at the party: he's the guy chugging from jug of cheap wine, a precursor to his death from alcoholism in 1967. This is a great story but there is an annoying \\"Oh gosh! Golly gee\\" aspect to the writing as if Jack were the world's biggest Eagle Scout, gone bad with the booze and the girls.<br /><br /> To me it's fascinating to see this work as a precursor to the cultural revolution of the 1960's. Here in the late 1940's and early 1950's we have: haiku; Zen vs. materialism; criticism of suburban TV zombie families; revolt against the suburban lifestyle; hot tubs; love of nature and backpacking: buying your clothes at Goodwill; yogurt; free love; taking all your clothes off at parties (still hasn't quite caught on); cooking with mesquite; hibachis (remember those?), and, of course, jeans and guitars. Hard drugs weren't in yet, at least in Kerouac's crowd.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|good graphics very fun old school shooter no lagging or freezing..I might have paid the 1.99 if it wasn'nt the faotd
0312370849|5.0|Excellent story which tells a very powerful and emotional story about love, responsibility and the powerful destructive effect of guilt.  I strongly recommend both the book and movie.

B005J7K964|3.0|Since being introduced to this movie by this theatrical release back in '84 I have seen several versions of it.<br />This is by far my favorite version.<br />Over the years I rented it on VHS several times.<br /><br />Subtitles work better than still shot text between the scenes for me.<br />The coloration adds to the movie and is not overdone.<br />The 80's score just has a lot more appeal to me than the original score.<br /><br />So when I saw Metropolis on the shelf I picked it up to take a peek.<br />It has been a very long time since I have seen this version and as soon as I saw what it was it went into the shopping cart.<br /><br />Memory is a funny thing, I ceratinly did not remember the film (video) itself being in such poor condition so I must admit that I was somewhat disappointed in the video quality of this release.<br />Maybe the VHS release was no better but on the old Trinitron it didn't matter.<br /><br />So buy it or pass on it ?<br />If you were not already a fan of this version I would say pass.<br />The video quality is not good and while I love the soundtrack it is probably because it is a benchmark in time to me more than the music being of timeless quality.<br /><br />I am glad I have it, but I think its more like a $10 release instead of a $25 release.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I play this game all the time and I even got my mom addicted to it it is tons of fun
1594744769|4.0|Just like everyone else says, the pictures are great, if nothing short of creepy. The story does remind me a bit of X-Men, but not as much as some other reviewers say. I found the voice of Jacob was perfect. He may have been a little advanced for his 15/16 years on the planet but I find a lot of loner teenagers are that way. I found it intriguing how the children ran through their lives like the movie Groundhog Day. They found enough things to keep them busy over the years with enough changes in their day to day to stop them from becoming bored. I think I'd get bored. Although, had I lived as long as they had I might have been able to read all the books I owned!<br /><br />I wish there wasn't such a cliffhanger at the end, though. By the time the next book comes out, I may no longer have an interest in it. Would the author be able to come up with some equally daunting photographs? Or will the next book be without?
B001M4YZ90|4.0|The plot in these movies is always very similar. The main characters always owe the crime boss money and they usually resort to crime to come up with the money. There is also some sort of \\"valuable\\" floating around the movie (Diamond, Rifles, Painting). Anyway, in terms of the story I thought this was probably the worst of the three I have seeen. Snatch and Lock Stock were better. However, Guy Ritchie still does his thing well with some very cool scenes. If you have not seen a Guy Ritchie film yet, I recommend you try the other two first. But if you know you like Guy Ritchie, you will not be disappointed with this film.
B0061JPYX2|3.0|Amy Winehouse has one of the most beautiful, sophisticated voices of our time her and her potential will be forever mourned.  I bought this CD for \\"Will you still love me tomorrow\\" which she did for the movie \\"Bridget Jones Diary\\".  I was ever so surprised that this song was not the same cut used in the movie but one where tacky over produced percussion prevailed.  It's hard not to focus on the background clatter.  Sooo disappointing.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Beautiful scenery and color graphics. I agree with others, that navigation could be a little easier, but it added to the challenge. Excellent game for the Kindle Fire. I enjoyed it very much! If you get stuck, come check the reviews, as this proved helpful as well. When you find the box with the flowers, it's the number of leaves that matter. Enjoy!

0061714372|3.0|I thought parts of this book were interesting, but overall it was a bit lackluster.  Something was missing.  Sometimes as I was reading I was thinking \\"this is kind of boring\\".  To be fair, I've been into reading rock stars' 'tell-all' books for a couple of years, and others have done it better.  While he admits shortcomings and mistakes, I believe Dave's viewpoint presented in the book isn't always the truth... it seems to usually paint him in a positive light.  All that aside, I was hoping to find this book much more entertaining.  I was a bit disappointed. So if you've ever been a Megadeth fan, by all means give it a look. There are definitely some interesting tidbits inside, but don't expect to be wowed by this one.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|It allows you to read so many different versions of the Bible. Plus the devotionals are pretty good. Better than most Bible apps.
0553582038|5.0|This is the first review I've ever written for Amazon though I've read hundreds. I am moved to write this review to help balance out all the ignorant garbage that is being said about this book and the next, A Dance for Dragons. This book deserves all 5 stars that I would give to every book in this series, some of the most beautiful and deep novels I've ever read. Now if you're reading this, you've probably already read the first 3 books so I won't lavish any additional praise on them. They're amazing. Enough said.<br /><br />A Feast for Crows is a great continuation and expansion to this incredible story. People who are writing all these negative reviews are so egomaniacal they presume to tell GRRM where the story should go. In case you made it through the first 3 books and haven't realized this yet, GEORGE MARTIN COULDN'T GIVE A CHAMBER POT OF WASTE WHERE YOU THINK THE STORY SHOULD GO. The story that he chooses to tell is always far more emotional, and revealing of the inner natures of his characters. The man has a way of writing in people's minds that continues to dazzle. He seems at times like he is 1000 year old. Laying bare cliches and tiresome twists for genuinely moving explorations of the human condition. How dare you sit there basking in his awesomeness and complain about what parts of the incredible landscape of Westeros he chooses to focus on.<br /><br />The thing I don't get it is how you could have followed the 'justice' given Ned Stark in Game of Thrones, and the Red Wedding of A Storm of Swords and NOW start complaining about where the story is going. Oh so you were just sitting there hoping that Robb Stark was gonna lose his War of the Five Kings right? You wanted Winterfell to be sacked and burned? You were happy when for 100 pages you believed Bran and Rickard brutally murdered?? But then if you were/are an intelligent person you see how incredibly honest and beautiful GRRMs plot really is. It doesn't conceal or distort life into what is typical ofa novel. It presents people in their full nature.<br /><br />Now, to A Feast For Crows. Yes Jon Snow, Tyrion, and Dany are not in the book. Get over it. Seriously. There is so much carefully crafted and tight plotting in this book they are barely missed. I am not joking. It is a testament to how deep and complicated the world he has created is that he can focus on other parts of the realm and you barely miss those characters. As others have pointed out, this book is very much concerned with the aftermath of The War of the Five Kings. The devastation of lands and peoples emotions. The rising up of powers and the struggle to control the kingdom. In this book you get the missing pieces of the Lannister family puzzle. You understand how they were able to control the Iron Throne through the first 3 books and you see if they will be able to hold on to it. The relationship between Tywin and his children is even more apparent in this book even though he is gone.<br /><br />The Iron Islands are one of my new favorite parts of the whole story thanks to this book. Anyone who says the books don't need more characters doesn't understand at all what GRRM is going for. The struggle between the Tyrells and Martells is also gripping. This book breaks down the last bit of 'Oh A Song of Ice and Fire is about the Starks'. It's not about the Starks. GET OVER IT. It's about something much greater and more beautiful than one family. The starks were the way GRRM introduced us to Westeros. But what he has in store is, again, far more gripping and exciting than one familys struggle.<br /><br />I could go on but I'll stop. Read this book. Read A Dance with Dragons. Ignore the idiots who say that GRRM has 'lost the story'. GRRM has created something far beyond what their ignorant mind will grasp. Thank you Mr. Martin.
B004ZISVWC|4.0|Troll Hunter, a Norwegian made thriller with subtitles was quite entertaining. Under the guise of a bear poacher, a secret in the countryside was uncovered by some student filmmakers.<br /><br />In any fiction movie, I want the plot line to feel believable. For the most part, that was the case with Troll Hunter. There were a few roll eyes moments, but overall it kept my interest. For what I am presuming is a low budget movie, the acting is particularly good. As well, the special effects are pretty good also.<br /><br />Yes, there are shortcomings, but overall it kept my interest and was entertaining.
0307987647|5.0|This is a book on tape I listen to it as I drive.  This is an old I would say Golthic age Nd ir is marvelous. The reader does an excellent job with the deferent voices  - I know it is really hard to do a female voice but he is really good.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|The script is absolutely original to me. My family members and I were puzzled for the first 15 minutes of the screen. We were glued to the screen in order to find out why a non-educated orphan could answer correctly all the questions in Who Wants to Be a Millionaire show.<br /><br />The scenes of the answers to the last 2 questions are full of twists and suspense. One example is the moment when Jamal phoned his brother for the answer of the last question.<br /><br />The movie graphically and convincingly shows how determined Jamal was in order to get what he wanted. For example, he jumped into a pile of human waste that was higher than he in order to see his movie star in person.<br /><br />The scene where the bad guys scooped out the eye of the street kid had some truth in it. Some of my friends from a third world country said something like that did happen in their homeland. There were some gangs that kidnapped children. Then they twisted their arms to make them disabled. Then they forced those kids to beg for money from spectators.<br /><br />Besides all the reasons above, this movie makes people happy and hopeful with its happy ending. I believe that's one of the reasons why many people love it. No wonder it won 6 Oscar prizes in 2009. They included best picture, best adapted screenplay, best directing, best editing, best sound mixing, and best original score (According to Oscars dot org site.)<br /><br />Freida Pinto is not convincing in her role as Latika, the love of Jamal but no movie is perfect. This film deserves 5 stars.

Eddie Vedder has amazing yet rather unexpected vocals throughout this entire album. He does a great job on every song.

And today it's at a pretty good value: free.<br /><br />Get this game!
1594744769|5.0|I purchased this book for myself after seeing it on Amazon. The photos and the description of the story fascinated me.  I started reading it and was hooked.  The main character is a wonderful, funny, insightful boy who tries very hard to understand his deceased grandfather's story.  He is driven by a need to come to terms with his grandfather's violent death and he does just that.  He is off on an adventure that the author describes in wonderful detail.  The relationships between this boy and the people he meets are not only humorous at times,they are also heartbreakingly realistic (for a fantasy book, that is). It all does come to down to good vs. evil!<br /><br />I loved this story and Riggs is a terrific teller of tales.  I encouraged my 13 year old to also read it, he did, and loved it.  The few times racy language is used  is not at all offensive nor is it over the top.  It helped keep my 13 year old boy interested since reading is not his first choice of activities.  Between the pictures and the dialogue I think most youngsters 12 and up would truly enjoy this book.  It has a wonderful message about loyalty and the struggle to do the right thing.<br /><br />I look forward to others by R. Riggs.
0385340540|4.0|A departure in genre for Mr Grisham, this novel is suspenseful, entertaining and educational! Kind of unusual for a Grisham novel, but he pulls it off with ease. Some people will object to the \\"irrelevant tangents\\", but in my opinion, a broader range of subject matter is stimulating and adds another layer, which sets a good book apart from a mediocre one.<br /><br />As is customary, the book deals with a trial and a conviction, but rather than getting a centerstage place in the novel, it is moved into the story's background. Instead we have a story of a man who's view of the world and himself is changed by several years in prison. Following his inexplicable release, he now appreciates freedom, anonymity, and leisure. He enjoys drinking cappuccino in small cafes watching the city life swirl around him, taking in the sights of an unfamiliar city and chatting with a new friend. All this from a man who used to think he was on top of the world and could manipulate it any way he wished, and crush anyone in his way. However, the con-man skills he learned in his power-broker years are not wasted - he uses them for survival, as he is being tracked by intelligence agencies, including the treacherous CIA which is willing to sacrifice him as a pawn in a high-stakes power game with foreign intelligence agencies. His is a well-realized and developed character at the very center of the book. I ended up sympathising with Joel/Marco (and sometimes admiring his cleverness and street-savvy) - now a desperate and isolated man, in spite of his past.<br /><br />The highlights of this book are the conversations with various off-beat secondary characters, and the Italian language lessons, which are sometimes humorous and always fascinating. I picked up a bit of Italian along the way. I have also learned some of the customs of Northern Italy, and a bit of Bologna's strange history. There's plenty of interesting information about Bologna's landmarks; the author seems to have a knack for making the city seem familiar to the reader. All this may seem to be a distraction from the story, but I think it adds color and realism to an otherwise improbable and possibly forgettable tale.<br /><br />In short, a very enjoyable read, and if not typical Grisham, a well-plotted suspense novel set in Europe.
1594203334|2.0|I have lived in France before, with an actual French family, and I must say that the claims made by the author are purely exaggerated from anything that I saw.  While I do like France, I cannot  even imagine envying raising my child as the French.  The children in the family with which I lived did not participate with the family dinner and would often have their own version of dinner - mostly consisting of comfort foods that any child would love to eat.  Veggies would not be put onto the child's plate for the sheer fact that it would just erupt into a crying fest, resulting in the parents screaming at the children.<br /><br />Going to the supermarket was no walk in the park either.  It consisted largely of the kids whining for toys and pouting and crying hen they didn't get it.  I suppose kids will be kids and that doesn't change from country to country.<br /><br />At the later stages in life, however, I don't see how these teenagers could possibly be considered successfully raised children.  In class, they would not pay attention to their lessons and would often not treat the teacher with respect.  My friend, who also taught in a French high school, told me stories where her students would straight-up tell her that they didn't care about the lessons and they refused to do the in-class activities.<br /><br />I don't really think that the French are the ideal people to idolize for parenting.

B0015XHP4K|4.0|First Blood 4.5/5<br /><br />Everything about First Blood is brilliant. From Goldsmith's rousing score to Stallone's perfect performance. Yes, you heard me. Stallone does act in this movie. I feel so sorry for Rambo. People are real nasty to him. Especially the Deputy Galt, one of the most evil characters in any movie. The scene in which Rambo finally explodes in the jail cell is one of my favorite movie scenes. The score that goes with this scene is SO intense.<br /><br />The Pacific Northwest scenery is also very beautiful and atmospheric. The sound design seems to be crafted so that dialogue sound natural, like it would in a mountain forest or in dead cold environments where the air cannot carry sound so well.<br /><br />I know that the character of Rambo became a 'little' exaggerated and silly in the sequels but do not let that alter your opinion of this movie.<br /><br />Rambo: First Blood Part II (3.5/5)<br /><br />The last time we saw John Rambo he was hauled off to prison for laying waste to a redneck town. And in prison he remains. For the first five minutes, anyway.<br /><br />Colonel Trautman shows up to offer Rambo an Escape From New York-style ultimatum. If he goes back to 'Nam and takes photos of American P.O.W.s, he'll receive a full pardon for his crimes against the hillbillies.<br /><br />\\"Do we get to win this time?\\", he asks.<br /><br />\\"This time, it's up to you!\\" Trautman says, which basically gives him license to massacre as many baddies as possible. And massacre he does.<br /><br />The first movie had a body count of one. Just a single death in the whole film. And it was accidental, caused by Deputy Galt's own stupidity. Whatever reality First Blood had is well and truly gone now.<br /><br />The biggest strength of this sequel is its rousing score by Jerry Goldsmith. The original theme is expanded and developed, with brilliant new ones kicking in at moments of high action. It's exciting stuff and you can only imagine how poor the film would be without it. Director George Pan Cosmatos was widely regarded as a hack. There is nothing here to prove otherwise, but his direction is adequate, rather than exceptional. There are rumors that Stallone actually ghost-directed the film. The action is very-well done, but it does have a rather by-the-numbers feel to it. The scene where Rambo emerges from a pile of mud is one of the few moments of spark. By today's standards, it's pretty simple stuff, but back in '85, when Ronald Reagan was in The White House and the Cold War took it's last few breathes, it became a massive hit.<br /><br />It's no secret that America lost in Vietnam. And 10 years on the country still felt cheated by the government. It needed a way to get back at them and show who the boss REALLY is. So Rambo returns to kick ass.<br /><br />Originally written by James Cameron as a script called First Blood II: The Mission, the film was never going to be anything other than pure fantasy. And it is here that the one-man-against-the-world sub-genre started. The villains are cardboard. Steven Berkoff plays the role of a stereotypical Ruskie bad guy with no grace, or charm. His character serves no purpose other than for Rambo to kill him last. No huts, or shacks, exist for any other reason than for Rambo to blow them up. No Viet Cong shows his face and lives.<br /><br />It's this touch-and-go attitude that prevents the film from becoming truly engaging, or worthy. The standard three act structure is apparent and you can tell that the producers just wanted to churn out a money maker rather than anything serious.<br /><br />Ted Kotcheff made First Blood about an emotionally scarred man, who wanted no more than what he deserved. Shakespeare it was not, but it was a good movie, even if it didn't set the box office on fire - just everything else. For Part II George Pan Cosmatos takes the same character and turns him into a killing machine. No human emotion, just mindless violence. Although there is room for Rambo's big speech at the end, it's not as clever, nor as moving, as is it was first time around. It sounds so very American and disgustingly patriotic.<br /><br />Still, the movie made millions and Rambo has become an historical icon. Everything about the Reagan era is is this movie. It's superficial, narrow-minded and VERY un-PC. But hey...it was the Eighties.<br /><br />Rambo III (3/5)<br /><br />Whatever credibility Rambo once had in First Blood is totally gone in this film which is more like Cold War propaganda than anything else, which is probably why they chopped First Blood off the title and we're simply left with the Rambo bit. As a character he's a bit more talkative but still has the same sadness in his eyes. And Stallone is absolutely HUGE. Yes, he's always been big but his figure in Rambo III is probably the biggest I've seen him. He could probably rip big Arn's head off.<br /><br />Since walking off into the sunset in Part II, Rambo is now living in a monastery in Thailand and has found inner peace. But he still takes time out to batter people with sticks in cage fights to raise money for the Buddists. But the no-good Red Ruskie Soviets are causing havoc in Afghanistan and one particular Colonel is taking great pleasure in massacring whole villages.<br /><br />Colonel Trautman and Robert Griggs (the ever-brilliant Kurtwood Smith) try to convince Rambo to come help them sort the Ruskies out. But Rambo is having done of it. He's done killing! He wants to raise a family.<br /><br />So Trautman is left to go it alone and is captured. Griggs delivers this bad news to Rambo who makes up his mind to go on another killing spree. Which is entirely okay as long as he only kills the Ruskies right? Once in Afghanistan, Rambo teams up the Muhujideen, learns of their many woes and agrees to fight the Ruskies with all his might. Even though he was going to do that anyway, but it's nice to have friends.<br /><br />The rest of the film is no more than a succession of comic-book action scenes and shoot-em-up set pieces. It's brilliantly shot, seriously, it's some of the best cinematography I've seen in an action film. I never expected Rambo III to look so good! It's a shame that Peter MacDonald (who was actually the second unit director shunted into 1st place after Russell Mulcahy left) doesn't stage the action with any sense of fluency. Yes, it all looks big and bold, but it's kinda clumsy and cumbersome. At the time, it was the most expensive movie ever made (even at a mere $65 million) and while it may be grand, it sure ain't graceful.<br /><br />Jerry Goldsmith's score is once again brilliant. But quite a lot of his original material was left out and old tracks from Part II spliced in. So as long as your prepared for sudden jump cuts in the music, you should really get a kick out of it.<br /><br />When it originally came out, Rambo III was kinda disregarded as a totally unnecessary sequel but in recent years the film has gained a political subtext and can actually be viewed in quite a few subversive ways. While I understand that the makers wanted to give the film a serious point of view regarding the Russian occupation of Afghanistan, I feel that integrity that the film has in modern politics should be disregarded. This is a RAMBO movie for Christ sake. The logic is shoot now, ask questions never. America did do the right thing by helping the Afghans fight off the Ruskies. But they did they wrong thing leaving the country to crumble afterwards (just like Rambo does). The rest is history. But I don't think a review of Rambo III is the best place to discuss this.<br /><br />It's a flawed sequel, but I like it better than Part II. There are some seriously misjudged moments but it's still a fun ride.<br /><br />The Blu Rays present all of the movies in lovely 2.35:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound. There are lots of extras too. Definitely worth a purchase.s big speech at the end, it's not as clever, nor as moving, as is it was first time around.

B004EPYZQ2|4.0|Super 8 is a homage to extra terrestrial films and is one of the better film to come during the summer in 2010. The characters are believable, you start to like the children and identify their passion for adventure and film making. They are the soul and the best thing. The adults are more or less props, except for Kyle Chandler and Ron Eidard who have substantial roles. There are some flaws, I did not feel a emotional connect with the alien. There are also a few minor characters whom I felt deserved some screen time such as the science teacher and the military guy. However this is a exceptional film in many respects. Abrams and his crew capture the ambiance of a small town and the essence of childhood curiosity. Four stars. 2/18/2012
B007BLDFWG|1.0|I'm sorry to say that this was a total waste of time and money. Absolutely baffled that this was ever made. Insulting.
B006MQRLSA|5.0|Sabermetrics is at the soul of this film, which has been adapted from Michael Lewis's book based on Oakland Athletics's remarkable 2002 season. The story begins with the bolting of three free agents. The dilemma for Billy Beane ( Brad Pitt) as the GM is how to compete with a team with a payroll like the New York Yankees. Guided by the ideas of Sabermetrics and a young assistant Peter Brand ( Jonah Hill) they come up with a list of players who are affordable but have been given a chance because of negative perceptions about them. This approach shakes up the team and upsets the scouts and the manager Art Howe ( Phillip Seymour Hoffman) Director Benett Miller takes us through the season all the way to their history making victory streak. This may sound like a documentary but the director and the screen writer have looked for stories within the team such as the arrogance of David Justice, the lack of interest in the game by Jeremy Giambi and the reluctant but ultimate hero Scott Hatteberg. It is however Billy Beane and his assistant Charles Brand who walk away with the accolades as their performance is amazing, understated and amazing. Money Ball is worth a look at  the game you thought you knew so much about but know so little. One of the best films of 2011. five stars. 2/23/2012

B006PZBR8S|4.0|A film set in the near future features Hugh Jackson, as a former boxer who trains robots for money ( unsuccessfully). He is reunited with his son who had been abandoned by him 12 years ago, however he is inspired by the boys attitude and learns to win again. Director Shaun Levy had hired Sugar Ray Leonard to consult on the ring action and the fight scenes appear real. The fight scenes are the best feature. Evangeline Lilly looks lovely but has nothing much to do. Mechanical story line literally but it is fun to watch. I thought it was a long movie almost 2 hours and 7 minutes but enjoyable. Four stars. 2/21/2012
1567184855|5.0|Journey of Souls is a book that will truly change your perspective of life on Earth. Michael Newton is a hypnotherapist who has compiled hundred's of case studies of people's \\"lives between lives\\" and has proved to be very thorough in doing so. When reading any spiritual or metaphysical topic that is impossible to prove with science, I look for separate reoccurring descriptions or occurrences that, at least from me, signal a sign of truth. Newton's patients do this over and over giving detailed explanations of what happens from the moment of death all the way to the point of rebirth, making the book hard to put down. Apart from the reoccurring descriptions, it makes sense on a deeper level, which gave me a sense of awareness and truth I guess I was trying to confirm. If you have found this book, it happened for reason. Read it! You will be glad you did!
B005LAIGP0|3.0|Daniel Radciffe  stars in this haunted house film called the Woman in Black. The title has been taken from Susan Collins and is about Arthur Kipps,  a London based lawyer with a 4 year old son, who has reached rock bottom since the death of his wife. His firm has sent him for a job to the estate of late Mrs. Alice Drabow to settle her affairs. The town residents greet Arthur with hostility and the house that he lives in full of strange happenings, which start the moment he arrives. Radcliffe is okay but the movies relies too much on mood and atmosphere to do the job of scaring us but that works only to a certain extent because things progress at a snails pace<br />Too much mood, alarming sound effects and dreary atmosphere cannot make a movie watchable. Three stars. 2/10/2012
B000W9DSVW|5.0|When you look at specific genres of storylines, the \\"crook as the hero\\" always captures my heart. Hollywood has a way of portraying criminals with the most endearing, salvageable, even lovable, character traits--not to mention jaw-dropping good-looks! Absolutely love all three in this series. Can't wait to own it on Blu-Ray! [[ASIN:146996788X Requisition For: A Thief: Book 1- A Diamond for the Taking]]
B004D2CPO0|4.0|Bloodletting, ruthless killing and unbridled violence are all a part of this film about power struggles between two Yakuza families, who have been played against by the chairman ( Kitamura Soichiro). He plays this game in such a way that each family will eventually destroy them selves and then he will be able to take control over them.<br />There begins a ritual of grisly killing and disappearance of the actors on the screen who die in quick succession where there are no survivors. If grisly killings carried out by men in sharp suits is your cup of tea. Three stars 2/22/2012
B006OKOZGU|5.0|As I'm sure you've already guessed from my title, I'm a fan of all forms of stories with \\"the bad guys as good guys.\\" To Catch a Thief is the ultimate classic for this storyline. Smooth, suave, good-looking John Robie (Cary Grant), southern France \\"cat burglar\\" with an adorable British accent, sets the incredibly high standard for the thief-hero. We have this classic in VHS. I'm glad I put off getting the dvd until now--I'm sure the Blu-Ray will be exquisite! Can't wait to own it!

B006L874PE|4.0|This book written by Agatha Christie in 1920 is in the public domain and can be found for free on the web. At the moment I write this Amazon only offers paid versions of this book.<br /><br />This book is set in World War One in the UK. A Belgian police-officer, who found refuge in the UK, gets involved in trying to solve a murder. The Belgian is Hercule Poirot, and this book introduces him.<br /><br />This is a very fine murder-mystery and I do recommend reading it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is the best game in history<br />it should have more ways to earn points like challenges<br />because it gets boring

Do you understand that ????<br />SO... It's just an alibi

0375869026|5.0|My twitter feed has been filled for weeks with my #nerdybookclub friends proclaiming #thewonderofwonder - so I just had to check it out for myself. With that much buzz, I was honestly concerned that it wouldn't meet my expectations. I was joyfully surprised that I loved it as much as the hype said I would.<br /><br />Wonder is the story of a fifth grade boy named Auggie (August) with a genetic disorder. He can't hide his differences from the world because they are stamped on his face for all to see. He spends his elementary years being homeschooled, due to the intense schedule of surgeries required to help him even be able to eat and breathe properly. In fifth grade, his parents decide it is time for him to start to interact more with kids his own age, though they know it will be incredibly stressful. Kids can be mean, though, right? What follows is Auggie's story of that year, but it is also a tale of other children struggling to fit in.<br /><br />What made this book so Wonderful? (Sorry, I just couldn't help myself)<br /><br />- The kids all seemed so real to me. There were no \\"bad guys\\", just children. Some were kind to Auggie right from the start, and some weren't. Throughout the story, though, the author gives us insights into each child. We get to see how even the popular kids struggle with their self-worth, hiding things about themselves that they fear will get them teased or shunned.<br /><br />- The shifting point of view during the telling of the story. Really, it was that shifting point of view that helped create my first point. We see life from Auggie's perspective, but we also hear from his sister, the kids in his school, and even his sister's boyfriend and friend. I felt like this gave a more well-rounded story than if the author had just given me Auggie's take on his school year.<br /><br />- Palacio uses a lot of pop culture references and changes in story telling styles. Okay, so I'm a Star Wars fan, and that may have influenced me slightly on thispoint. The references included a lot more than just Star Wars, though. Wonder includes shout outs to Bone, Avatar, Star Wars, Diary of a Wimpy Kid, and more. Yes - this may keep the story from \\"aging\\" well. Seriously, though, I think it's more important that it connects with the kids who are reading it NOW. Kids love these references (and so do I), and that's what will help hook them and help them connect with the children in this story.<br /><br />- Life lessons. No one wants a lecture. Wonder, though, infuses the concepts of tolerance and the idea that it is good to \\"act just a little kinder than is necessary\\" throughout an interesting tale. Kids and adults can spark conversations about how even the most popular kids often feel like they are wearing masks, and that everyone struggles to find their place. In a world where intolerance and bullying seems like the norm, this story is a way to open our eyes to the kindness that also runs deeply in each child.<br /><br />Were there flaws? Sure. I had a bit of trouble with one of the character sections. I loved Justin, but the lack of capital letters in his entire portion of the book made the teacher/editor in me cringe. I wanted more about Summer, and I would have liked a bit more information about Julian as well. Also, some of the information the school administration shared via emails would probably violate some privacy laws. Honestly, though, these small concerns were just a blip on the radar.<br /><br />Not only did I read it almost nonstop, starting on a Sunday night and finishing it up on Monday morning, but I immediately started to think about how I could get enough copies of it for my classroom to be able to use it for reading groups and discussion. I decided to go with just a few copies to circulate for this year. Hopefully it will come out in paperback soon so I can invest in a small group set, though.<br /><br />Buy this book to read yourself. Buy this book to use as a read aloud or in a small group. Talk toyour children and students about kindness, and see what they can tell you in return.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games was the best book I've read in a long time, if not ever. I read the book in 2 days time. (Would have finished it sooner, but I have two little one running around!) I couldn't put it down. I couldn't wait to finish whatever I was doing when I wasn't reading, so I could get back to the book! I started reading the book because I saw previews for the movie and heard great things about the book. And I don't know I didn't get the book sooner. It's suspenseful, thrilling, intriguing, sweet, shocking and every word in between. Buy The Hunger Games, you won't regret it!! It's the best book and I can't wait to start Catching Fire next!
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|Let's face it, Steve Buscemi is a great actor, he's good in comedy and drama.  In fact, all of the cast did a fine job. The writers also wrote great scripts for the first season of Boardwalk Empire.  However the reason I purchased this is to see my favorite New York actor, Johnnie Mae.  She portrayed Luanne, the Commodore's housekeeper.  The Commodore is portrayed by Dabney Coleman.  Johnnie Mae commands the screen every time she's on it.  She appears to be beaten down and subservient to the Commodore but you can tell something's simmering beneath the surface.  The Commodore speaks abusively to her.  \\"He treats that dog better than me!\\" she mutters.  If looks could kill, you know the Commodore would be roasting in hell.  At a time when African Americans were expected to bow and scrape and grin and bear the abuse they received from bigots it was no wonder Luanne got fed up with the Commodore's treatment.  Whoever wrote those lines for her when she was asked why she did a certain thing is a genius.  But the manner in which Johnnie Mae delivered the lines will not soon be forgotten.  \\"Because if I'd used a shotgun I would've had to clean up the mess myself!\\"  Now, that's a woman who just wasn't going to take it anymore.  Bring Johnnie Mae back!

B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is a great way to kill time and its very kid friendly. Wish you didn't have to build up money to buy games but cute game.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|Latest version of gingerbread on Photon crashes on launch.  Looks like a good game so will certainly check back to see if it gets fixed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so fun and cool.It is a mixture of games but to play a certain amount you have to have a certain amount of money.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Game play was great on the kindle fire. Really took me back to when games were made to be fun, instead of just looking pretty.
B006ON41FC|4.0|good game for kids and adults alike. We think it is worth the money. Even young kids will like this app.
0316010669|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell has already proved with best-sellers such as `[[ASIN:0316346624 The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference]]' and `[[ASIN:0316017930 Outliers: The Story of Success]]' that he can write a page-turner on a popular psychological subject, and `Blink', published in 2005, is no different in this respect. His potential public is large as the subject matter could interest de facto everybody:  how come that snap judgements, taken intuitively, often seem to render better results than decisions based on more-informed and very rational reflections?<br />Gladwell is a gifted speaker and this is reflected in his writing style whereby the reader is directly addressed, questions are posed and the attention is grabbed by revealing examples: E.g.  it can be disconcerting to know that an experienced observer can predict with an uncanny high probability if a marriage will last or end in a divorce and this by simply overhearing (and analysing) a short conversation between both partners; `priming experiments' show that the mere use of words associated with old age made the  participants in the test walk slower...<br />These are only two of the examples given,  the book provides quite a lot of very interesting anecdotes to surprise people on boring cocktail parties.<br /><br />The book has undoubtedly entertainment value and Gladwell keeps the readers interested, but more seriously now, what message does he want to transmit?<br /><br />Gladwell illustrates that conscious decisions made on basis of a lot of information are oftentimes not better than `snap decisions' which are taken fast and unconsciously. Most people do find it hard to accept that these snap judgements, this `rapid recognition' based on mysterious, unknown rules, do have value.<br />More problematic is that these snap judgements can be prone to error as well and this due to the fact that in certain circumstances the use of stereotypes and implicit associations does lead to wrong conclusions. People can be manipulated, first impressions (e.g. judging somebody purely on appearance) can be thwarted. People are not always aware of this. Especially in cases where people are confronted with something completely new, first impressions are not that helpful, but rather confounding. However experience can help, the intelligent user of this unconscious decision-making process is aware of all these drawbacks and can use snap judgements in a controlled, efficient way.<br /><br />Gladwell knows how to tell his story, however what I did not like that much is his use of a very specific `technical vocabulary' whereby he wants to make a compromise between scientific concepts and popular terminology resulting in words such as `thin-slicing', `the mystery of the locked door' and titles and subtitles tending to hyperbole (e.g. the subtitle of the book: The Power of Thinking without Thinking).<br /><br />Calling Gladwell `one of the world's most original thinkers' (mentioned on the cover of my paperback-edition) is of course a gross exaggeration, however `Blink' is a fascinating read on an interesting subject and it offers quite some startling examples. The most important lesson that I have drawn from this book is that intuition is something which can be helpful, can be trained (the protestant work-ethic which one can also find in other books of Gladwell, e.g. in `Outliers') and adds a valid approach to solve problems, supplementing a purely logical, conventional method. The lesson is that we are not always better off by gathering more information.<br /><br />What lingers on as well, by the myriad of sometimes very intriguing examples - and this probably less intended by the writer - is the observation how fascinating and manipulation-prone beings we are.
B0067R0APK|4.0|10 times better then the weather channel app (which crashes often).  Love the graphics.  Easy to use and read.  Quite accurate also.
0634049011|5.0|Working with this book, I quickly realized there are two things to know when learning guitar:  the instrument, and the music.  I learned more about my instrument in one day with this book than I did the entire time I studied it previously.<br /><br />I had studied classical guitar for several years,and learned all sorts of music, including some by Fernando Sor and Albeniz.  I was really quite good.  I never understood the fretboard though and have since forgotten how to play the music.  Trying to relearn it, I realize that I can read the notes and know where they are through about the 5 fret, but not beyond that.  I had learned by following my instructors directions as to where on the neck to play the music and just playing it from memory.  Now, years later, I am trying to regain my lost ability, and thought my problem was note reading.  It is not.  The problem is that I don't know the fretboard.<br /><br />Unlike a piano that has one line of keys, and a visible pattern of black and white, the guitar has 6 strings that all look alike.  After working with this book for two days, I can see the pattern on the fretboard and am quickly learning where all the notes are.  The author understands that music is largely about patterns.  Rather than having you memorize everything with rote practice, he clearly shows you the patterns and makes it easy to remember.  He also has you practice several different ways, so depending on how you learn, you will still be exposed to a method that works for you.  I am very excited that it will not take long to become fully knowledgable of where every note is on my guitar.  I wish I had discovered this book ages ago.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great brain exercise and fun. I recommend it but be careful as you can get hooked. I need to limit myself and read more.
B006PKQQJS|2.0|this game is really addictive but its got boring after a few days I mean don't get me wrong and all but it just got boring because well your basically just tapping the screen and well tapping the screen gets boring get the game if you want to be bored
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It has an arcade style layout which works well.  And you can play the games over and over again to get enough points for a new game, but most of the games are just rebuilds of classic games and sometimes not even that well.  Plus user interface and controls are not always easy to understand, and the instructions are not well labeled.  It did however run well on my EVO

B0019N8P2W|4.0|I loved this show when it was airing, so I'm enjoying watching all the episodes again! Even with the replacement soundtrack, the content of the show, in terms of writing and voice acting, is still hilarious and worth the purchase. All discs come in one thick DVD case (not the fold-out variety) and you have the option to watch all the applicable episodes with the \\"Daria Day\\" intro for that episode! Great buy, thanks for offering this!<br /><br />My only complaint is that the two movies don't appear on the discs in the chronological order, but rather on a bonus features disc.
1451648537|5.0|This book is a classic example of what happens when a good writer writes about a great subject. It creates a very inspirational story as the subject raises the bar for human achievement. Of course it is not an easy task to write the biography of Steve Jobs. Although Steve is no more, what this book brilliantly achieves is that it keeps his spirit alive and gives the reader a deep understanding of what this man was really like. How he grew up, how he thought, how he worked, how he dealt with human relationships and what drove him.     The fundamental idea behind Steve Jobs's life and what shaped his career and achievements was his passion to do something at the junction of technology and humanities. This basic theme repeats itself again and again in this book. He built companies where \\"leaps of imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering\\" and produced products \\"in which technology would be married to great design, elegance, human touches and even romance\\". Products \\"that combined the power of poetry and processors\\". What beautiful words by the author!     The author does a great job of describing the environment that shaped his thinking from an early age i.e. \\"of growing up in a valley that was just learning how to turn silicon into gold\\". Going to a college where geeks were discovering the hippies inside them. An environment in which the flow of cultural currents saw a fusion of \\"flower power and processor power\\" and also \\"enlightenment and technology\\". In the process of describing this fertile environment and how it shaped Steve's life, the narration is further enriched with the viewpoints of over 100 friends, relatives, competitors, adversaries, and colleagues. The fact that the author personally interviewed Steve Jobs over 40 times adds to the authenticity of the material. With the viewpoints of so many people the writing has many entertaining flavors of wit, wisdom, humor, sarcasm etc. For a taste of this here is a quote by Steve when he is trying to lure Sculley to join Apple:  \\"Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water, or do you want a chance to change the world?\\"     This book is also an eye opener into the work culture of Silicon Valley as it exposes the towering egos, the lack of civility, abundance of arrogance and attitude among the key players of the hi-tech industry. As the book progresses, you learn about the agony and ecstasy of creating companies and products and launching them in the market. But in doing so the author tells a great tale and reveals the creative genius of Steve Jobs. As he says it is \\"about the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur, whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries\\".     The more I read this book, the deeper became my understanding of the complexity behind this man. His binary thinking, mild bipolarity, mood swings, bluntness and his human interactions seemed out of this world. His lack of civility and an absence of social graces were simply shocking! Inspite of all these short comings, he seemed larger than a hero from an Ayn Rand novel. As an architect, I started seeing influences of other legends in the products that his companies made e.g. they have the minimalism of Mies, they are finely detailed like Frank Lloyd Wright and they also have shades of Frank Gehry. Let me explain. Frank Gehry has an ability to steal ideas of visual concepts from paintings and translate them into buildings e.g. the pleated headdress in a Vermeer painting inspired him to design the roof in Maggie Centre. Similarly in the words of the author \\"he didn't invent many things outright, but he was a master at putting together ideas, art, and technology in ways that invented the future\\". Also \\"like a pathfinder, he could absorb information, sniff the winds, and sense what lay ahead\\".     Steve's life is a fascinating tale of how the play of genes, environment, nature and nurture create a unique individual. It also makes the reader question the educational system. A college drop-out who hates taking pre-requisites and instead takes a job at Atari, audits courses at Stanford and then starts his own company at a very young age.     If I were to summarize the essence of Steve Jobs in a single phrase, then I will call him the `Hi-Tech Trimurti'. Let me explain. In Hinduism, Trimurti is the merging of three Gods, namely Brahma - the creator, Vishnu - the preserver and Shiva - the destroyer. In this hi-tech age, Trimurti has appeared in the form of Steve Jobs. Here is a break up of these three personalities:    *Brahma: The creator of companies and products that have touched many lives all over the world, is a sign of Brahma.  *Shiva: Steve's ability to revive Apple by laying off 3000 employees and focusing on just 4 key products instead of many crappy products is proof of Shiva. As he says \\"We make progress by eliminating things, by removing the superfluous.\\" His detachment from materialism, aloofness from human relationships and an ability to heartlessly end relationships that contribute to nothing and having a cult like following among geeks also implies Shiva.  *Vishnu: Well his legacy says it all. Bringing about a revolution in six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing raises the bar beyond normal human reach. Creating such a great legacy in such a short life shows a manifestation of Vishnu. Hence I call him `Hi-Tech Trimurti'. Hey, got to think different!

1416550534|5.0|The House of Riverton has a narrative that seamlessly bounces back and forth between Grace Bradley's years as a housemaid at Riverton up until 1924 when a young poet's death at a glitzy party on the estate rocks the household; and 1999 where our protagonist is interviewed for a documentary about the incident, which forces her to re-examine this painful event. The story unfolds at a leisurely pace, allowing plenty of time to soak in the rich atmosphere. The characters are well-developed and even if the mechanism behind the incident is a bit familiar, this is an extremely satisfying read that is sure to appeal to fans of Downton Abbey.
B001PPGAIK|5.0|This review is more about the BLU RAY than the movie. The movie is an epic with a romance and a story that has plenty of action. If you like big old fashioned movie epics you'll probably like it. The Blu Ray is very good, beautiful picture, good sound. I would rate this as one of the top 10 or 15 Blu Ray DVDs I've ever seen. The cinematography is first rate and this type of film deserves to be viewed either in a theater, or on Blu Ray with a good surround system and a large screen TV.
B004O4K4SQ|4.0|Works so-so on my Incredable 2.2 but terrific on my Xoom 3.2. I really like the Casual mode because it allows me to progress through the game despite getting my ass whipped by the aliens no end of times (as so oft happen to me in these types of games). Good graphics and sound and smooth play led to a most enjoyable 30 minutes. I like that I can pick up the game at anytime and continue my journey. Good FAOTD and possibly worth the normal price to fans of the genre. Found the Asteroid levels to be jerky on the Inc. but other than that it was playable. Think the extra surface area on the tablet made the game easier to play. Overall it's a good game.
0920668364|5.0|\\"Love you Forever\\" is the most powerful story of life long love between mother and son.  I cannot read it without crying!  Children love the story too, but I purchased this book to give to a mom on her son's first birthday.  I have given this book to  my sons and grandsons.  Munsch is THE BEST!
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Very entertaining and fun to play retro style game. Runs great on Toshiba Thrive. Get it while it's free, thanks Amazon!
B005K17RU0|1.0|Four out of five times the app dies; have never been able to fully explore it without the message it needs to close. Not sure why I keep trying.
B006W0QOF2|3.0|I tried to keep an open mind going into this film.  Hoped for an action drama with a story that moved as the title and trailers would indicate, but was sadly disappointed when at least a third of the movie was taken up with artsy shots and no dialogue or action.<br /><br />The movie was only 1hr and 41 minutes long, but during the first 20 minutes it's tough to figure out where the film is going.  I kept wishing it would get appreciably better, as the actors in it are good actors - just not a lot for them to do for most of the film!<br /><br />One really great 'drive' sequence, two others were OK, but frankly, even for a girl - there wasn't enough consistent action to make this film good.  Nor was there a lot of acting.  The best acting came from Albert Brooks who plays a bad guy; not his usual gig.<br /><br />There were lots of scenes where Ryan Gosling's character was simply staring out windows or driving through the night, which would be OK if you could count on something meaningful to the story after those scenes, but 'Drive' never really takes you anywhere.  At least not quickly or in a satisfying way.<br /><br />Honestly, I found it tough to watch it from beginning to end.  Consider turning it off after 30 minutes, but held on.<br /><br />Very violent, bloody sequences were expected and the film delivered on that front.  When the story finally did get rolling, Gosling's character develops very little, but you know he's basically a good guy - loyal to his friends even if he's on the fringe with his illegal activity.  Unfortunately he's not particularly interesting or likeable, but you do empathize with him in the end and appreciate he wants to do the right thing.<br /><br />In the end the good guy wins, but it ends very much the way it starts, which felt like driving in circles to me.  The viewer is left wondering who was this guy and why did I let him 'Drive' me anywhere?

1612680011|5.0|This book isn't a \\"how to\\" book. It is more of a philosophy book presented though an interesting story. During the past couple of generations the path to success has changed. The older generations are still doling out advice that worked in their day. That advice can still work for some today, but the world has changed and if you want to improve your odds of success then you need to change with it. This book is an excellent first step. The next book to read is Cash Flow Quadrant.

B00006ZXSK|5.0|Timeless movie!  The dvd has both full and wide screen options, plus spanish and french audio and subtitles.  The French dubbing is particularly well done.
B006ON41FC|4.0|I like this game,but my daughter loves it. I find it a bit challenging,she flies right through it. cute graphics.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|This is a very good FAotD. It is easily worth the 1.99 price tag on it.  It kinda reminds you of Space Invaders and Galaga at the same time. Ultra responsive touchscreen controls (sometimes a little too responsive),and loud, bright colors.  The story is a bit annoying at times, but it is best read at least the first time you play as it gives information on some of your controls. I have had no issues with the game on my Evo 4g.
B007BLDFWG|1.0|I thought this movie was dull and boring from start to finish. A definite waste of time and about as intriguing as watching the grass grow....
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I am very close to the author's age so I got the maximum benefit from his many pop culture references.  I was completely taken in by this story.  I was frustrated when real world activities like my job kept me out of this world.  The characters are great.  The concept of the oasis is amazing.  The 80s references took me back to a great time in my life.  Write more please.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|I'm so excited to see Hexage with the Amazon app store. Radiant HD was my first purchase when I bought my first android back in 2010. it was a great game then, and I love it even more on my kindle. The colors are so vivid and it translates well on a larger screen. The jokes making references to the 80s arcades are pretty funny, and it has one interesting story line. definitely a great addition to any app library.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|If you loved \\"Blood and Sand\\", I'll love this one as well. Although this a \\"prequel\\", it should be watched AFTER \\"Blood and Sand\\" and before \\"Vengeance\\". It fills in a lot of information on various characters. Lucretia will appear to be a far more complex character than in \\"Blood and Sand\\"!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have only used it a few times, but so far so good. It's great for keeping track of goals, lists, and ideas that just pop in your head while on the go.

B006ON41FC|4.0|this is a very addictive game, is very fun, the music is great and everything is very original but this game have crashed my kindle fire twice: the first time I didn't. noticed anything weird until I wanted to use my kindle again; the second one was today when playing without an Internet connection, it crashed and frozen the device when it tried to send my score to open feint automatically.

B004UHSB5A|4.0|I love dominoes and this game is a straight up dominoes game. you can't change game rules, not even points to play to. it also has some bugs like when you lay a domino there is a chance it will not attach to the dominoes on the board and it becomes its own board. I still play this game a lot. I would like to see some sort of win/loss record keeping or something. I once won 5 to 250, and one hand I had all the five tiles at the start, these are things I'd like it to remember or keep track of as well, like achievements.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Amazing game...always wanted to replay on hardcore but didn't own it. Works perfect on LG Thrill, even in 3D Mode.<br /><br />This is quite possibly my favorite Amazon App of the Day ever.

The moment I opened it the plastic holding each DVD stated braking apart.  A week later and it is broken off the spine and into multiple trays that no longer fit into the box.  To pay this much for a season and not be able to keep the DVDs in one package and safe from damage is a rip off.  It is the cheapest shoddiest packaging I have ever seen on a DVD series.

0312641893|5.0|Marissa Meyer has completely blown me away with her debut book, Cinder. Full of the familiar details we associate with Cinderella - a handsome prince, a wicked stepmother and a seemingly unattainable ball - but told in such a new and different way that the story becomes fresh and exciting!<br /><br />Linh Cinder is a cyborg - a human who has been surgically repaired with mechanical parts - and this makes her both a second-class citizen and the property of her legal guardian and stepmother - Adri. Working as a mechanic in New Beijing alongside her android companion Iko, Cinder dreams of a life of freedom for her, Iko and Peony - the stepsister she loves. Her thoughts of escape quickly crumble as Peony catches the fatal plague Letumosis and Adri has Cinder's body \\"volunteered\\" for plague research, blaming Cinder for Peony having been infected.<br /><br />Cinder is a wonderful protagonist. She's sarcastic and full of witty one-liners:<br /><br />\\"If you excuse me, I'd better go try to earn my keep so you might actually blink an eye the next time you find a convenient way to get rid of me.\\"<br /><br />She knows the treatment of cyborgs is unfair, but she doesn't complain about it. She feels such passion that I can't understand how anyone could question whether she was human, especially when it comes to the people she loves. She's selfless - sacrificing her dignity and her pride to do what she knows is right, and she never takes the easy way out. She grows to care for Prince Kai, which fuels her guilt over withholding that she is a cyborg. I loved watching Cinder's journey, and the many discoveries she makes about herself and her past along the way. I truly felt my heart ache for her with every accusation thrown at her by Adri - whether it was being blamed for her stepfather's death or being told her emotions weren't valid (because she's incapable of feeling). I admired her strength with coming to terms with her past and what that will mean for her future, and her resilience in the face of multiple obstacles.<br /><br />I loved watching her relationship with Prince Kai develop from mere astonishment at being in his presence, to the banter and teasing of a blooming crush. Watching Kai try harder with each of Cinder's objections was entertaining, and his complete bafflement over her rejection to his request(s) that she accompany him to the ball was endearing. Trusting Cinder with the information she uncovered in his android was a risky move, but it was nice to see him open up honestly, without the censorship that comes with being diplomatic. I really enjoyed that Cinder didn't spend a lot of her free time thinking about Kai's physical appearance, and that when she did spare a minute for him, it was with concern for his well-being. It was refreshing to see a romance that had chemistry and spark, but that wasn't all-consuming for either person involved.<br /><br />I also loved the supporting characters. Iko is sassy and charming and hilarious! I laughed out loud when she wheeled in, dressed up in Adri's pearls and lipstick, pretending she was at the ball. My heart seized up in my chest when Adri told Cinder she had left some spare parts on her bed that couldn't be sold and thus were useless, and I cried real tears for Cinder who couldn't. Queen Levana (and the lunars in general) was so creepy, never knowing what was hiding under her projected illusion of beauty. Her ability to manipulate a large, enraged and protesting crowd into believing she was worthy of being their empress was both impressive and frightening and knowing that everything she does has an alterior motive kept me in suspense of her next move. Dr. Erland is mysterious and slightly crazy, but you can't help but feel drawn to him. He has this quality about him that is simultaneously both exasperating and captivating, making you soak up every word he says - it's like he holds the secrets of the universe, but wants to leak them to you slowly instead of just blurting out whathe knows. So frustratingly good!<br /><br />The world-building was fantastic, and actually incorporated the entire world! After WWIV, the remaining Eartherners came together to form a united front, joining together in an alliance of peace. All that remains is getting Queen Levana of the Lunar planet to commit to the alliance - something the leaders of each area are trying to accomplish together. It was easy to picture New Beijing, a bustling city filled with new technology and old traditions, and the idea that a nuclear war lead to the destruction of life as we currently know it is completely feasible. The plague that has affected both Cinder and Kai personally is a world-wide pandemic, leaving no region untouched. Everything was just different enough that it didn't take a lot of suspension of belief to achieve the type of world Cinder lives in, which really helped me capture Meyer's vision.<br /><br />I loved everything about this book.

B002BWP49C|4.0|I rec'd this in perfect condition and of course, love it. Was surprised Amazon itself was not selling this.  This is part one of the last book by Stephie Meyer..Edward and Bella marry..finally have sex (that took forever in the books too!)and Bella finds herself pregnant, which should never have happened.  Alot of harrowing difficulties come up so I won't say anymore..enjoy!
0316017930|5.0|Gladwell is a master of the revelatory essay filled with \\"Aha!\\" moments, and I've been reading his stuff for years in NEW YORKER. And when he began doing book-length explorations of the things in our world that need explaining, I followed right along. This one, on what \\"success\\" actually means and how people actually attain it, may be his best yet. In America, we have a fetish for the \\"self-made man,\\" the guy who (supposedly) pulls himself up by his bootstraps, but the author makes a very, very convincing case that this is simply not so. The successful person -- and we're talking not only about the hyper-successful, like John D. Rockefeller and Bill Gates, but also the top Canadian hockey players in every season's new crop -- is the result of timing and opportunity as much as innate talent. You can talk about much larger groups, too, like why do students of East Asian background do so much better at math than those of European descent? That's a combination of ingrained work ethic of the extremely demanding rice-paddy variety and the reality that learning math takes not special talent but application. Anyone of slightly better-than-average IQ can become good at math, it turns out; you just have to really work at it. (My wife, a professional mathematician, is nodding vigorously and saying \\"Yes!\\" So there goes that excuse.) As always, Gladwell's style is smooth and easy to take as he works over your preconceptions with a meat cleaver. And I can think of thousands of politicians and other policy-makers in this country who ought to be required to read this book.
B006ON41FC|5.0|very addicting!  love this game.  like trying to achieve all the goals makes it a new challenge every time. definitely recommend this game.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|OH WOW!!!! What can be said that has not already been said? Great retro graphics!!! Great gameplay!!! Takes me back to those great days when video games were simple and fun!!! There are elements of Space Invaders, Galaga , Asteroids plus more blasts from the video gaming past....um... no pun intended, in here. Great sounds and music!!!!  Upgradeable weapons, special power-ups and awesome boss fights will keep you coming back for more. Looks great and runs great on my Kindle Fire. Great FAOTD but.... well worth a purchase at only $1.99!! Don't pass on the the non-stop fun of Radiant HD!!!

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I've used Sony MDR-7506 headphones for professional audio production (monitoring and mixing) since the mid-1990s. Their flat frequency response of 10 Hz - 20k Hz helps to ensure that the audio I hear is pure and unembellished. They serve as my trusted source of reference across various sound recording platforms. I highly recommend this product.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This plays perfect on my Samsung Infuse.<br />It's highly addictive. Time flys when I play. Get it, you won't regret it.
B004O4K4SQ|4.0|this game is OK but I wish the score wasn't cut-off..,...,<br />game can you find the: I 5 times:<br />lllllllllllllllllllllllillllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllillllllllllllllllllil<br />llllllllillllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllilllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll<br />if you found it, Great job!  and if you didn't, Nice try and try again!  :D

1933865407|5.0|This book is an amazing collection of Bruce's work. If you are a fan of his influential style, this is a must buy.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|While many people have panned this book I have to say to those who have that perhaps you need to take another look at this book in the context of the entire story arc. Before reading A Dance with Dragons I reread all the books. I went into reading A Feast For Crows with the view that it and A Dance with Dragons were one book. I'm glad I did this. Many years ago, when I first read Feast I was really disappointed with it, but now having been able to put it in context with Dance my view of it totally changed. These two books show a master storyteller putting all his pieces in place, much like a good game of cyvasse played by Tyrion Lannister and, as we know, a Lannister always pays his debts. I believe GRRM will pay his debt to us, his audience, and deliver a very satisfying conclusion to this series based on what he has set up here in Feast and Dance.
B005GVF95O|5.0|Samsung galaxy nexus prime. I was babysitting and this app was so useful. it really helped to keep the 5 yr old occupied.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game seems. stupid but it is amazingly. fun. I love it I have it on my ipod and now on this
B0052UZIFA|1.0|BEFORE UPDATE: I've played this for months with little to no problems, finished it maybe 4-5 times and earned all &quot;Achievements&quot;.<br /><br />AFTER UPDATE: All my saved game data (money, plants, achievements, etc.) got erased! This sucks! I would've rated 5-stars, but erasing someone's game after update is INEXCUSABLE!!<br /><br />Motorola Atrix.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Great for downloading youtube videos fast and easy. A quick way to get videos on demand and share with others.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is great because of the varity and all of the other cool things like buying your next games so you have to go back and replay games.
B001L62REY|5.0|This is a movie you should see at least once. I have seen it like twenty times over and still enjoy it to this day. The music and scenery are beautiful. The cast is wonderful & Daniel Daylewis is so handsome, he just melts my heart.
B00486070K|4.0|A simple plug-and-play adapter that works like a charm.  Wish it were a little cheaper, but not having to deal with downloading and installing of drivers needed for non-native product may just well be worth the premium.
B004I744AS|5.0|amazing for kindle fire, this dictionary has so many different features, its really useful and just cool to read on a daily basis. I love the quote of the day!
1569242739|5.0|I got the book yesterday, and upon flipping through it was impressed that none of the recipes called for 'egg substitutes' or 'soy cheese' or any of those fake trying-to-imitate-dairy-but-not-succeeding items. I tried my first cupcake from the book today: chocolate with orange, with an orange buttercream frosting.  Wow!  The whole family loved it. Our son is allergic to dairy so I am always in search of non-dairy recipes, and I think I can stop my search for cupcake recipes. The recipe I used was faultless. The cupcake turned out soft and fluffy and simply delish.  I did adjust the recipe for the frosting though; I halved the sugar, just because we generally don't like over-sweet things. My son liked up the frosting from the mixer; he'd never had GOOD, non-dairy frosting before.  This book's a keeper.  You won't regret buying it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app. Only complaint is you can't use it without wifi. Still it's a great app to have.
0374275637|5.0|[[ASIN:0374275637 Thinking, Fast and Slow]] by Daniel Kahneman  & [[ASIN:0071756221 Market Mind Games: A Radical Psychology of Investing, Trading and Risk]] by Denise Shull<br /><br />Together, these two books may just represent a complete summation of the current state-of-the art in trading psychology.  Daniel Kahneman (D.K.) is like the venerable grandfather of the not-so-young \\"new science\\" of Behavioral Economics.  Reading this book is a real treat...as if D.K. were perhaps your own grandfather imparting the best wisdom of his years.<br /><br />There really is not much new content in the book, per se.  What makes the book valuable is the fact that D.K. has taken the chance towards the end of his career to offer a comprehensive overview of his (and others) ground-breaking work spanning over a half a century.  If you are a professional in the field, you likely have been aware of these concepts since they were first shared in professional journals in the 70's and 80's.  Otherwise, you've probably never had such an opportunity to have the important discoveries made by D.K and his cohorts explained so thoroughly and eloquently.<br /><br />Mostly, the book is about the many odd ways in which the way people think diverges from what they actually do.  Through many examples, D.K. illustrates that man is often apparently an \\"irrational actor\\" which stands in sharp contrast to the \\"rational actor\\" which is a crucial assumption of the long-dominant Efficient Market Theory.  When you consider that Efficient Market Theory is still taught with a straight face in all Business Schools, and despite the fact D.K. won the Nobel Prize ten years ago his work could actually still be considered cutting-edge.<br /><br />But if you want to know where the bleeding-edge of trading psychology is today, Denise Shull (D.S.) appears to have a corner on the market.  While D.K. and his peers were fascinated with thinking and behavior, they seem to have entirely overlooked the all-important thirdelement ~ feelings or emotion.  I suppose it makes sense, seeing as they were of the John Wayne-era where feelings were considered a thing to be hidden or controlled.  But this oversight cost them the prize.  Amazingly, D.K. concedes at the end of the book that despite all he has discovered, he can offer nothing in the way of advice as to how to change one's behavior to where it is more reflective of one's actual best interests and desires.<br /><br />Fortunately, this gaping void is where D.S.'s work picks up.  In Market Mind Games she describes through a multifaceted narrative how feelings can serve as the key to unlock many of the mysteries concerning the way our minds work and how it can influence our behavior.  Not only do our feelings from our past shape how we behave in the present, D.S. shows how our feelings in the present can be a guide along the path that puts our actions back into alignment with our best interests.  In the future, the wisdom of remaining aware of your feelings will be more widely understood and the changes it will bring to many of our institutions will be profound.  For now, be thankful that D.S. is here to share this essential piece of the puzzle with traders who are looking to close the gap between what they think they should do and what they actually do.<br /><br />Many have made the comparison between being a fighter pilot and a trader.  If that is the analogy, D.K.'s book is the manual to explain how the plane works and D.S.'s book is the pilot training guide that explains how to actually fly the plane.  Reading these two books together, you really are getting a pretty complete synopsis of what is currently known about how our minds influence our behavior and how to leverage that knowledge into better performance.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Game is fun with lots of levels.  Very intricate details on tiles, make it hard to see on mobile device.
B006ON41FC|5.0|simple but addictive. young kids can play it but it still has various challenges that keep things interesting to play
B001S6Y0AQ|5.0|If you like jazz at all, you need a copy of this...Brubeck at his absolute best. His odd time signatures and fantastic scores make this album a keeper. Hard to believe it was made that long ago...it is as fresh as ever.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|Two rednecks travel to the woods to fix up a house.  Big city college students travel to vacation nearby.  Gore and hilarity ensue when the two groups meet.  The decade's best romantic comedy.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|Won't even open without crashing on htc evo. I had to uninstall. Too bad, I really hoped this app would work.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|Does not even open, constant force closing on mytouch 4G. Looks like a good game, it's a shame. This is just filler so don't read it.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Can't put it down.  im not halfway through it and want more.  got to eat...I forgot to eat.  have fun y'all.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Works great on Droid Charge. Controls are basic, but that's the point. Easy to use, upgrades are a fun addition to the classic blast 'em up genre. Thanks FAOTD!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have had no problems with this app on my kindle fire. Very useful in many ways. I'd recommend this to anyone.
1451648537|3.0|I bought this book for my book club.  It wssn't something I would have chosen.  Since I am not into computer or business stuff, I basically skimmed it.  I got to page 18 and texted a friend that I was ready to put it down, but would give it to page 50.  I felt that the writing up to page 30 or so was pretty poor, but it did improve.  I did finish the book because I could see from the first 50 pages that Steve Jobs had some serious personal issues. I did know that he was married with three children, so I wanted to see how he handled personal relationships.  I was saddened that this brilliant, but eccentric (to say the least) may have caused his own death by the way he handled his treatment options when diagnosed with cancer.  I was glad that he found a woman who loved him.  The way he treated his colleagues was brutal, but he was brilliant.
0486479110|5.0|See my review of The Essential Edmund Dulac.  But suffice it to say, this book FAR outweighs the other in terms of the broad selection and the subtlety of the colors.  As with all Dover color illustration collections, one must beware that some of the colors lose their subtlety and tend towards looking as if they have a greenish, brownish or bluish wash over them.  But compared to the Essential book, it's obvious that the prints here are much truer to whatever they would be in any first edition.  There are very gentle gradations of shade in the colors of the pictures along with Dulac's wonderful lines.  I saw one first edition advertized for $6,000 or more so I will content myself with this and other Dulac reproductions I own.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|After reading several one star reviews with regards to the Thunderbolt, I was a bit apprehensive about trying this game. I'm happy to say that it DOES work and it looks and plays great. After downloading, move it to your SD card before you open it. Start playing the game and it may close unexpectedly during play (it did for me), restart the game and continue. I finished the level and played additional levels with no problems. Give it a try.
B007BLDFWG|1.0|There's a terrific movie waiting to be written about communal cults, but this isn't it.  The pacing is turgid, the dialogue is pedestrian, the lighting is annoyingly murky and all the actors seem to be on Thorazine.<br /><br />As for all the praise for Elizabeth Olsen, I can only assume the enthusiasm is just carried over from her more famous, older twin sisters.  She's unattractive and chubby, with appalling posture.  And she simply cannot act.<br /><br />Viewing this film was like watching a teenage girl sulk for two hours - which, now that I think about it - is exactly what the film was.
B004A8ZWVK|1.0|The Help is an affront to anyone who actually knows or knew black maids from that time.  There is nothing positive about the two primary maids played by Ms. Davis and Ms. Spencer what with their \\"I is kind,\\" and \\"Frying chicken makes me feel like all is right with the world,\\" shucking and jiving.  This is essentially a film that was based on a book (which stole the basic facts of black people's lives without interviewing them or paying them, so isn't the author a champion of racial manipulation and keeping blacks in their places) a horrible story about the greatness of the white woman who tells the story and gets to move to New York to be  big time writer, while the character portrayed by Ms. Davis (who I held in high esteem until this garbage) gets the joy of being a fired, middle-aged black maid who in real life would most likely never work again who would wind up destitute.  As for Ms. Spencer, when she uttered her fried chicken line, I wanted to get up, reach through my television, and smack her upside her head.  I don't know what the purpose of this story was, but it most certainly was not to provide insight into the struggles of black maids or the civil rights movement because it stands as an embarrassment to both.  My only consolation upon watching this mess was that I rented it, and will never have to be subjected to it again.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game for kids it is very fun unlocking and playing games. I would probably buy this if it were 99 cents
B0066W1AZK|5.0|this is a great ap. love the quick response. ability to adjust difficulty is good but I wish it was on a ssection scale rather than a totally sliding one.
B006T5FDLG|5.0|Wow, love the riffs, Trujillo's bass playing sounds awesome, Lars drumming is not boring and Hetfield sings his heart out on these 4 epic songs. Im glad they released this EP because these songs need to be appreciated as an EP record. My favorite is Hell and Back,,, whe they play this one live is going to be insane. Love it!
B006ON41FC|5.0|BEST game ever &lt;3 i love it, so funnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn&ntilde;nnnnnnnnnnnnn (:<br />lol. not one this wrong with the app! (: its great for my kindle fire (:
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's a good app but some of the games are pretty hard.Over all it is pretty addicting app! :-) you should buy this app!
B004O4K4SQ|4.0|This is a great Retro game!  Good colors, music and story with simple controls.  It would greatly benefit from the addition of a description for the weapons and upgrades, it would be nice to know what everything actually does, and that would make this a 5 star game!  Well worth the download time for the FAotD,  Thanks for making this game.
B006ON41FC|4.0|This game is so addicting. There's no playing just once I always end up playing for about 30 min. when I say I'm going to play one round.
B004O4K4SQ|4.0|I would probably rate this game 3 stars.  It is what it appears to be...Space Invaders-like play with glowing graphics and some additional story line and purchase system.  To me it is like 85% Space Invaders, 15% Tyrian - which is too bad because I love Tyrian, but was never much for Space Invaders.<br /><br />So, my rating is more my preference for the game and not the quality, which I think is pretty good.<br /><br />I played for only about 10 minutes on Casual and found it a little slow paced.  I'm sure the higher difficulties would be a much more frenetic challenge.<br /><br />I found the graphics smooth with no glitches.  I am running on a Droid 2 which arguably is a pretty old and slow phone by today's standards.  I can only believe that all those having issues have something else wrong with their phone or some conflicting application.<br /><br />I have an idea for all of you with FC problems...wipe your phone and install just this game.  If you still have issues, report back and I'm sure the developer will take heed.  If your issues are solved, go ahead and install back your other apps...chances are you will find which other app(s) are causing problems.  You can then go give them bad reviews!  Point is...realize that a program not functioning is not always the fault of just the program itself.  the fact that dozens of other people play it just fine is an indication you have some sort of problem with your phone.<br /><br />My guess is that those of you so quick to rate it one star and &quot;suuuuccckks  FC!!!!!&quot; probably download every single FAOTD and have so much junk on your phone I'm surprised you can even pick it up.  Uninstall your pranker call software and the &quot;shut up&quot; button you use on your sister.<br /><br />Give the developers a break...and take some responsibility for maintaining your device.<br /><br />An extra star to balance out the griefers.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|I got excited about this one being a fan of old school arcade. When it said optimized for EVO, I thought screw the bad reviews cause my phone is on the in list. Yet, it wouldn't even open without going straight to force close. So had to install.
B00538MG6A|5.0|Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />Aspect Ratio: 1.85:1.<br />Audio: DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio.<br /><br />The video quality was very good.  Not perfect, but not at all disappointing. I give it about 9.0 to 9.2 on a 10.0 scale.  Audio was very good also, but there just wasn't a lot of surround sounds in this movie.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|lololol I got dis app for frizzle son!!! was 1.99 but itz frizzle nizzow. love da he graphics yo. dis shizz is swizzeet
B001P06GX4|4.0|We have only played this game once but already love it!  My 9 year old son loves this game.  He didn't want to stop playing.
0321647440|3.0|Well I'm sure I will learn alot from this book but frustrated that the practice images on the dvd are not correct.  There are actual jpg files to edit but some are on dvd some are not.  On peachPit website they say to contact seller.  I did and Amazon VERY RAPIDLY  sent our another without waiting for my return. , but it's the same. I'll keep it cause I'm sure a third would be the same but it seems like Peachpit would fix.  I orderd a different book and chose a different publisher because I didnt' feel like I could count on the dvd working.I even contacted Peach pit again...no answer.  I'll contact one more time and email them my reveiw but it's too bad they don't have the same customer service that Apple (or Amazon) has since they are the actual manuals used by the Apple Store employees, you would think they would be accurate
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a fun little app. I was able to play a round of solitaire immediately. It was just like the game I enjoy on my Pc.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|love it. get it if you can. glad it was free but would buy now. great intro to the game.
B0057GYOA4|5.0|It doesn't get much better than this. Too bad there will never be another one. Kurt Cobain is truly missed.
0545425115|5.0|I picked up hunger games because of the movie coming out.  What I found was a book that I literally could not shut once I opened it.  It is a thrill ride from about chapter two on and leaves you hunting for the second book so you don't have to stop.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I wasn't expecting much from this movie and I knew little about Queen Victoria, but this movie was a delight to watch.  It made me laugh and cry and the actors did a very good job in this movie.  I would highly recommend watching it to anyone who enjoys romance movies.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is very helpful. i love the fact that it changes and they add a new feature, and it has some awesome features.
B006O5Y0SS|5.0|If you pined to be one of the Lost Generation's Paris expatriates, you will LOVE this movie. It is in my opinion, Woody Allen's best. Genius genius genius. Funny, entertaining & accurate. A must see!!!
B004T32SOK|5.0|great cloud storage app, now more than ever since for a limited time through March 23rd you get 50GB free for lifetime if you sign up. excellent with the limited space on the kindle fire and makes it easy to sideload apps you've backed up from you android phone using the same app that are not available in the amazon app store like google + and google music to name a few.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|installed and i got a black screen with sound that i couldnt close out of.. not only couldnt close out of it, it made my phone unoperatable i had to take the battery out and restart. uninstalled as soon as it would let me!! i have a galazy s.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|I feel like there might be hope for humanity after watching this, right up there with Up & Finding Nemo.
B005T87QCI|3.0|this game is hard to play at first but after a while gets really boring and cannot unlock all the character's you have to play with the same ones and after you play your decent amount it crashes and it wont let you leave. do not buy
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The books are a great read. I could not put it down. But I disliked the change of the font size...it bugged me a bit.
1451627289|5.0|As one whose mid-20s life was jolted on 11/22/63, to the extent of a six-month funk, I rushed (through BOMC) to get Stephen King's work. Through all the fiction came a splendid recreation of the Dallas of that time, an ugly scene too often replicated today. We haven't learned, but Mr. King, through a teacher, tried hard to teach.<br /><br />Bob Hammel
B0066W1AZK|4.0|this app works fine on the kindle fire. game is more than adequate for playing chess. good strategy. and game playing skills, keeps you sharp and a good way to spend downtime. well worth downloading....
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Well worth the few bucks.  The game was challenging and fun.  Highly recommended.  This game is fun for both experienced and novice takers.
1451648537|5.0|This is an amazing story of Steve Jobs's constant quest for making an amazing product. I was looking to read this to understand a little more about the factors behind Apple's success and this book shows how Steve Jobs and his intelligence and personality played a large role in that company (and Pixar). The book gives a great inside look at Jobs's flawed family life, his binary view of the world and how he kept Apple driven towards creating great products (as opposed to profits).<br /><br />It was one of my favorite reads of the year.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very good game really enjoyable. This game is very versatile. Perfect time killer. My daughter and I both enjoy it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|love the challenge of this solitaire, not the usual easy wins.  highly recommend<br />  .<br /><br /> to all card game enthusiasts. Have lots of solitaire apps, like this one best.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|Alchemy is a very addicting game.  By using four elements, an android device, and a little clever thinking, you will eventually unlock all 380<br /><br />My friend showed me this app in late 2011.  At first, I thought it was weird.  But after playing it, I couldn't stop.  So before leaving this page, at least try the game!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Splashtop Remote Desktop app is really versatile and efficient. Perfect for on the road situations. I access my computer from work frequently. Great app!
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|I am not a fan of female vocals but Susan Tedeschi can WAIL.  Derek Trucks is awesome too, as is the rest of the band.  The recording is really good to my ears as well. One of the best of 2011.
B006UG90RM|4.0|This is far, far better than we could ever have hoped it to be. After two listens through I think this is going to get heavy rotation from me and I actually think its the best since their debut.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to be in the front of stalls when VH supported Black Sabbath in London in 1978. I already had and loved 'Van Halen' and was blown away that night and again at the good old Rainbow in North London four-months later.<br /><br />This new release is heavier in tone to the first couple of albums and I beleieve owes a huge debt to Living Colour, particularly their third and final album, 'Stain' from 1993. Eddie's tone and style closely resemble Vernon Reid and 'Honeybabysweetiedoll' sounds like an outtake from that album - Check it out, its great.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|This is a fantastic game especially for the FAotD. The only downside is apparently it FC's on some devices but I have not had any issue with that.<br /><br />Ignore the average score because of incompatibility, this is a great game.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Very nice Twitter app for the Kindle fire! It seems to work great! Now if only we could get facebook to release an official app!
1594744769|4.0|Not my favorite book, but it was good.  I am glad I read it.  I do wish there would be a follow up to it.  It is that sort of book.
0143038583|1.0|Like many I read this book based on the recommendation of friends who felt it was a shocking exposure of the food inductry that offered a path to the salvation of mankind.  I made it to about page six when I recognized that the \\"facts\\" had either been cherry picked from questionable sources or had been invented by the author.  That does not mean that everything in the book is necessarily untrue, but it does mean that anyone familiar with agriculture in this country cannot accept this book that is being presented as nonfiction.  This author has an agenda and appparently will do whatever is needed to excited those who lack knowledge and will sell books. The author quickly loses all credibility, which makes it impossible for me to accept anything he has written.
B0067Q42BY|1.0|Very disappointing; the paid full version of Mahjong Artifacts has as many ads as the free version. This app keeps asking me to review the game and to try some of their other games. What I really find annoying is the game wants me to go through a tutorial each time I start up the game. It also continues to ask me to buy the full version, even though this is supposed to be the full paid version. If I had known that I was going to have to go through numerous screens to get to the game, I would not have bought it. Until I read that the developer has fixed the full paid app version (option to skip tutorial, no ads, no requests each time to rate ap), I will remove the app from my Fire and Android Smart Phone.
B000JIHP88|5.0|I purchased this mobile when my son was 1 month old. This has been great in entertaining him for awhile. Now that he is 5 months old this mobile helps put him to sleep. I love the 4 different music choices and the bright colors, they really catch his attention. I also like that the leaves move up and down while the animals rotate. So, it has a little more than your average mobile. The remote is a nice feature. I just never really had to use it because I would go up to his crib to check on him and I would just press one of the buttons to change the music anyway. It seems that one round of music last long enough until he falls asleep though. Overall I really love this product and it seems to do the trick. Also, this is a great price for what you get.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Fun game nice features. Works great on Droid RAZR no issues. Nice graphics and the auto zoom helps and is a nice touch.
B000IKQMFO|5.0|I admit that half way through, I had to search for character descriptions in the movie to get it all straight in my mind.  The scenery/house is almost a movie onto itself, so I had no problem watching it several times to take in as many details as I could.  I love the movie and am sure in a few months will watch it again (especially now that Downton Abbey Season 2 is over until next year).<br /><br />It's a fascinating glimpse into another stage/era of Britain's aristocracy -- one is at the same time repelled and drawn to the history of it all.  I adore, Helen Mirren, Maggie Smith and Eileen Atkins.
B006ON41FC|4.0|This game is fun! But it needs more achievements! I was able to finish all the achievements in like 4 hours of playing.

B0034G4P94|5.0|Great story, fun fight scenes. More along the lines of a \\"Rocky\\" than a \\"Never Back Down\\" kind of movie. Compelling characters and story, not machismo MMA.
B00008J2PG|5.0|This movie shows another side of the war, an untold side.  It portrays the dangers of being  soldiers trying to find a safe place so as not to be captured by the third reich.  A masterful plan by Gregory Peck who is responsible for housing, clothing and moving thousands of soldiers in and around  Rome. It will keep you on the edge of your seat and it has  a twist at the end.  A must see!!!
1933492953|5.0|This is an excellent, simple, but powerfull book. The autor knows two things:<br /><br /> -What he writes about<br /> -How to comunicate it in the most effective way<br /><br />So, if you have a seasoned professional in the top of his game, explaining you what is important to know, in a very direct, graphical, easy to understand way....then you have gold...if you pay $17 for it...is a robbery practicaly.<br /><br /> So, get one copy and enjoy.<br /><br />The only thing i could like more about this book...i would love to pay twice and get twice the pages (with similar quality content of course...is a rather short lecture book since illustrations takes 70% of the pages.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Bought this for my brother as a present who does photography as a hobby and he absolutely loves it.

B006H3MIV8|5.0|Love this CD, play it over and over and never tire because there are all different artists. Pete singing Forever Young at 90 something is my favorite!
B000FC1LOC|5.0|So, to start off, if you are anything like me, are are a fan of themovie now and would like to become a fan of the book as well. When  first purchased this book,  expected it to be a lot like the book which, to tell the truth, it was a lot like the movie, which at the very least tells me that the creators of the movie did a good job of adapting the book onto the big screen and making it come to life. But you also need to expect some MAJOR changes, that will be revealed if you read the book.<br />Like most books adapted into movies, the plot remains the same-- with two sisters, one with APL, and the other concieved to save the other sisters life. There are many of the same main charactors--like Dr. Chance, the lwer that creates a special bond with Anna, Aunt Zanne, and the cute survice dog. But one that I reallythink they shouldnt have taken out was Julia. Although not an essential character, she was a very nice girl and someone who I think could have added a little more emotional depth to the story.<br />Lastly, I wish that they could have ended the story in a way that was different, because both of the endings really kind of sucked. It was way too emotional for a twelve year old, so I dont recomment it for anyone the same age as me.<br /><br />But, other than that, I can not begin to exaggarate how much I recommend that you NEED to read this book! It was amazing with just the right ammount of emotion from the charactors, and the author also made sure we knew the urgancy of this familie's situation. So, yes, I give this book a five, and I hope that you get the chance to read it, too.<br />  Sincerely~Avery Jean. Kiss kiss, and goodbye for now :)
B00000DFRS|2.0|the cd did not have a factory seal. just a plastic cover. I don't think it is brand new as described.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This was one of the best books I've read recently, by far. The way the author develops the characters is incredible. I recently saw the movie too - which, seeing the scenes depicted in full color, was a little disturbing at times, but still way cool. Definitely worth a read.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like it. My husband and I team up to win. It is definitely time consuming but well worth it because it has lots of variety and you have to work to open the other games.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Despite assurances that all game data would be saved,I Installed the update and lost all game data. I've lost game data before. If a call came in while playing the game I often lost game data. That issue seemed to be resolved with the upgrade to 2.3 (gingerbread). Nothing like an&quot;update&quot; to set you back to ground zero...

B000RGX4P0|5.0|It isn't uncommon for a group with as big a hit record as [[ASIN:B00000JCFP Sports]] was to wind up taking a good deal of time to follow it up,only to do so with an overly slicked up recording. Huey Lewis & The News found an interesting way of dealing with this. Rather than further emphasize the rockier strains of their music with heavier guitars,wailing vocals and what have you they elected to make something that emphasized their homegrown talents,in this case their songcraft and vocal harmonies. And while the results were a bit more studiocentric for sure it was actually a pretty logical follow up to it's blockbuster predecessor and in fact joined that one along the same path to success.<br /><br />  The most rocky of the songs are the opening hit song \\"Jacobs Ladder\\",\\"Whole Lotta Lovin'\\",\\"Doing It For My Baby\\" and \\"I Know What It's Like\\". Even than however the sleek sounds remains which is heard just as strong on even more polished pop tunes such as \\"Forest For The Trees\\" and even the hit \\"Hip To Be Square\\". The bands Motown influence is heard of course on \\"Stuck With You\\",done a bit much over time with radio ware but always proving it's meddle to my ears. One constant theme that binds this album together is reflection on life growth and the end of youth. They never handle it darkly though. There's always a nudge and a wink about it all. Especially on the albums closers,the beutifully harmonized acappella number \\"Naturally\\" and the sleekly produced soul ballad \\"Simple As That\\".<br /><br />  In many ways this album is very much an extension of the way they were going with the music they contributed to the [[ASIN:B000002O4S Back To The Future]] soundtrack. Also it does something I haven't heard on a lot of pop albums since the mid 60's. It takes potentially awkward subjects such as maturity and perceptions of pop culture and somehow gives it all a singable and happy atmosphere. With the enormous angst explosion that was by this time already very prominent in the rock world but would be almost a given several years after this,I'd honestly refer to this as one of the better handled reflective pop albums ever. It would be long until unless you had a sound that was some variation of the Seattle Sup Pop sound (really-it's very true if you think about it) than a reflective pop album wasn't likely to be taken very seriously. In fact I don't see this album as particularly lodged in it's time musically. And that's a huge part of it's overall charm.ck world but would be almost a given several years after this,I'd honestly refer to this as one of the better handled reflective pop albums ever.

B00729GQ0A|5.0|I delved into the paranormal world with Laurell K. Hamilton and have fell in love with the genre, I admire Laurells works and didn't think I could find another author as great as her!

B004TJ1H3C|5.0|One of the greatest science fiction shows of our current generation, it was a shame that SciFi (I refuse to call it 'SyFy') channel cancelled it.  The subject line of this review is no joke:  I am an avid science fiction enthusiast in the classical sense and feel strongly that this show embraced what scifi was originally designed to do--be a present-day metaphor for the human condition.  The show contains the technical mastery of any of Artur C. Clark's greatest stories while propelling the audience forward through intricate character analysis and development.  It then goes a billion light-years further by proposing intense sociological questions with intriguing hypotheses.  At the end of season 2, which was unfortunately the final season, an amazing arc unfolds that is reminiscent of the Foundation Trilogy.  While the previous two shows, Stargate: SG-1 and Stargate: Atlantis, do add some background information to the show, they are by no means necessary to watch.  Stargate: Universe takes the intensity and human development that was laid down in the original movie and expands it to fill any scifi enthusiasts imagination.  The two preceding series were also more family orientated, while this masterpiece is definitely adult in nature.  Gritty, dark and often starkly introspective, purchase this, turn down the lights in your viewing room, and strap yourselves in for one heck of an enlightening ride!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I really, really enjoyed Wool. It's easy to say that this has become one of my all-time favorite novellas. It's also quite easy to say that I would recommend it to every SF fan wondering if the numerous five-star ratings are really accurate. It is surprisingly more challenging to explain why Wool is so compelling.<br /><br />I believe that one of the most important parts of the world of Wool is how accessible it feels. The technology is familiar, the characters are warm and easy to empathize with, and the villains are believable. Life is normal inside the silo, and that makes it easy to relate to the main characters. And then - the outside grabs you. You are offered vague, tantalizing hints - ruined cities on the horizon, toxic winds... the huge, fascinating possibilities of the unknown. It's intoxicating to imagine what could have led to the bitter winds and what might lie in those crumbling ruins. And to think that the Silo denizens can never, EVER express any interest in it! My own burning curiosity was almost physically palpable, even as I become more and more entrenched in the stilted and suffocating culture of the Silo.<br /><br />So it was effortless to get sucked into Wool. Even buried in an enormous silo in the ground, they felt like real people. Even surrounded by toxic winds, it felt like a real place. And when the characters start probing and asking questions, you're already hooked, because you want to know, too. About everything - what is the Silo? Who made it? How  long has it been there?<br /><br />The way Howey answers all those burning questions is really what makes Wool such an excellent piece of science fiction. The concept is enough to pique my curiosity, but the story and the writing is truly great. Lengthy exposition, cumbersome plot development, long-winded explanatory lectures - you won't find many of these in Wool. Without these hiccups, it feels almost like you're flying through the pages.<br /><br />I'm really looking forward to more of Wool. I still find myself daydreaming about it long after I finished reading. There is so much possibility left, and I can't wait to see what happens next.
B003K16P3M|5.0|You know, I didn't expect to love this book. Well, I'm always looking for books/stories to fall in love with, but I don't think I expected it of this book. Just within the first chapter, I was already hooked. It's hard, it seems, for authors to do that. Because if I'm not entranced by the first chapter, I become restless. But god, this pulled me in from the very beginning. The entire plot and story got me to give the 5 stars that it gave - and I do not give those out easily. I'll probably be bugging a friend to read it.<br /><br />Katsa is our main antagonist and she is lovable. I didn't really notice this until some reviews have mentioned the anti-marriage, pro casual-sex stance in the book. It doesn't really bother me. All authors have their own beliefs and however they incorporate it into their stories is their business. Maybe it's cause I don't really care for marriage as a whole. Though, in this world, that might sound odd - but then the world is odd as it is, with the Gracelings.<br /><br />All in all, I hope I may have influenced you to read the book. It is definitely not something you should pass up. Sometimes the synopsis of a story may not be appealing, but once you have been immersed in the world, you might find it hard to part with it (for me, this was the case of The Hunger Games). And I was. But, Bitterblue (book 3) will be out in May and that's good enough for now.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|I have heard of apps that force close on poor quality phones, but seriously, the DROID X?!?! The game looks good, but until it actually works I give it 1 star for the icon.
B005LZW8FO|4.0|I loved this! Deeply moving and nicely paced, Another Earth poignantly gives us a glimpse at human fragility through a most unique lens.  How often do we say to ourselves, \\"If only I had done this differently...\\"?  This film exquisitely pairs the pain of guilt and loss with innocence and redemption and fuses them into a single whole. It left me ponderously quiet for a long while.  This is primarily a drama, but there is just enough science fiction in the story line to keep this movie from being anything we have ever seen before. Very fine film making, great performances and a wonderful script make Another Earth a must see!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Great Family Movie. Values for the whole family to learn. Sit down at home with all the kids and show them what a father should really be like.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this app. Everyone in my home has it on their various devices. iPod touch, iPhone 4s, android phone,  and of course our Kindle Fire. Its so great! Soo many study plans, and devotions plus access to the Bible right in this light weight device!
B000SVZIR6|2.0|This movie was a disappointment.  The King and I is one of my favorite movies, so I really looked forward to seeing Anna and the King.  Although I like Jodie Foster as an actress and have enjoyed many of her movies, this one fell flat.  No chemistry between her and the King.  Zero chemistry.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book was definitely not as good as the first two for me. I felt that it dragged in a lot of places and that some of the characters didn't seem as true to form as the other two books. Katniss seemed to go from strong female lead to a snivelling cry baby that hid from everything and kept needing to be saved until the very end. It was overall okay but a dissappointment in reference to the fisrt two books. It's a good read but not great.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game. I have only had it for 2 days and I'm addicted. got more then 20 games unlocked already. the crossed wires is the best.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I thought this book was just as engaging as the first, one amazing twist after another. The capitol will apparantly do anything to keep the districts in line! I couldn't wait to read the last one!
B003K16P3M|4.0|I have been reading a ton of YA fiction as of late! I thoroughly enjoy books with strong female leads and it seems YA fiction delivers on that desire. I really liked Graceling, Katsa is self-sufficient, smart and still relatable and Po is the type of male lead a lot of young girls dream of. I didn't enjoy the amount of time Katsa and Po spent apart during the book but I feel the author did it partly because she wanted to remind the reader it is ok to be on your own and Katsa is plenty capable of taking care of business on her own. The only drawback for me is it's not written in first person POV, still very well written but I find first person to be more interesting in these types of books especially if it switches between main characters. Overal, I look forward to additional works by this author in the future.<br /><br />*I do want to point out as others have this book may not be appropriate for all young readers, there is a fair amount of adult content you may want to review before hand.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book had me from the beginning, it's very fast paced and interesting throughout the book. I highly enjoyed the characters from the main characters Katniss and Peeta to the side characters like her stylist Cinna and the prep team. It is not overdone with romance or action and has quite a few twists and turns.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|This movie stands for the dad that most of us hope to be, many wish they had, and some men never become.  What inspiration this movie was to me, from the start to the end.  Every man should see this movie, especially before starting a family.
1594489505|5.0|When people ask me my favorite song, movie or television show, I have trouble answering them because one doesn't truly stick out.  However, when asked about my favorite book I can immediately answer \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" by Khaled Hosseini.  After reading \\"The Kite Runner\\" I fell in love with Hosseini.  When I was presented with \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" I unsure of how Hosseini was possibly going to top \\"The Kite Runner.\\"  I was blown away.  Since my initial reading of this book a few years ago, I have read it 2 more times.  I came on Amazon to publish a review in hopes of convincing more people to read this wonderful novel.<br /><br />The story revolves around two Afghani women named Mariam and Laila.  Both have to overcome great adversity simply due to the fact that they are women in such an oppressive country.  Without spoiling the story, the two become unlikely friends and form a bond so strong that it resonated into my heart as the reader.<br /><br />Not only was the story great, the book is educational.  The reader really gets a sense of how scary, difficult and oppressive it is to be a woman in Afghanistan.  After reading this book, I have an even greater appreciation for women in that country and what they are forced to endure.  This book was a pleasure to read and I recommend it to everyone.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun, addiction, challenging, really fun and exciting when I have time to play this game. great game. showing it to all my friends
B002MQYOFW|5.0|\\"Exciting\\" is the best word I can use to describe this book.  I could not put it down until I finished it.  Don't let the fact that it is technically a \\"young adult\\" novel deter you.  As a 20-something who dislikes young adult fiction, I was hesitant to read this book.  However, once I started, I couldn't stop.  Though the prose is a little juvenile and choppy (e.g. the characters say exactly what they are thinking/doing), the overall theme and story is exciting enough to keep anyone of any age hooked.  Just a warning, the book is all about violence and teenagers being forced to kill each other to survive.  There are also some graphic descriptions at certain points (though tame compared to today's standards), so be wary if you are letting a child read this.  Overall, great book that I would recommend to anyone.

B002S0OBN2|1.0|My wife and I are big fans of Phantom and were looking forward to listening to LND.  We took a 400 mile trip last weekend and listened to LND on the way, so we could give it our undivided attention.<br /><br />All I can really say is - What a mess and disappointment.<br />The characters are cartoon caricatures.<br />The plot is predictable and uninteresting.<br />The music has almost no memorable songs. The best points were where a little of some music from the original Phantom was used and that just served to remind me of how addictive the music of the original was and how poor this is by comparison.<br />And finally - worst of all it was boring.<br /><br />We did stick it out to the end, but you would need to tie me down (or put me to sleep) to ever listen to this mess again. I am very disappointed in ALW - perhaps he needs the money.

0307352145|5.0|As a very introverted person growing up in a family of six extroverts (and being surrounded by them in my chosen career) I have always wondered what was \\"wrong\\" with the way I think. Why don't I want to go to the party when everyone else does? And if I do why do I gravitate to the edges of the crowd rather than get into the thick of it?<br /><br />Susan Cain has produced a book that will not only make introverted people go \\"ah ha\\" when she describes scenarios and behaviour, but also provides explanations for the why as well. Drawing on psychology, neuroscience, genetics and general biology and physiology there are few pages where you don't glean some important piece of information.<br /><br />Having passed the book onto others to read now as well (extroverted and introverted) all have come away with a deep appreciation for the skills that are often overlooked and start realising the strengths and opportunities that exist when we play to our strengths.<br /><br />Highly recommended whether you're introverted or not - probably more so if you're not.
0385736002|4.0|Fifteen-year-old twins Josh and Sophie find themselves in a supernatural battle between good and evil when the \\"cool, big brother-ish\\" Nick Flamos is revealed to be 700 year old Nicholas Flamel and keeper of the legendary Book of Abraham the Mage and holder of the secrets of eternal life and the Philosopher's Stone. It's a good thing that Josh and Sophie's parents are archeologists since that helps cut down on lengthy discussion about mythology and mythological creatures, leaving plenty of time for nail-biting action and magical mysteries. A great book for middle and even high school kids who have already read through Harry Potter, the Magyk series, etc. and want something else. There are 6 books in the series so far plus two \\"side stories\\" so there are lots of follow ups for die-hard series readers.
0671688782|1.0|My mother read this book when i was a child and used to 'hold' me because she thought it would help me let go of anger.<br /><br />Firstly, I was a pretty calm and happy  kid and I think reading this book made her think i was secretly hiding some inner rage. During the sessions i would shout and scream, but not because of some inner turmoil, but because i was terrified at being restrained and not allowed to move. Thinking about it now still brings my heart-rate up and tears to my eyes. I would say and do anything to get out of the sessions, one time i even purposefully wet myself so she would let me go.<br /><br />I am also quite certain that these sessions gave me a fear of enclosed spaces. I struggle to sit in corners at restaurants or on the window seats in trains or planes, even in the back seat of two-door cars. If someone jokes around and won't let me out of a hug, I feel incredible panic and fear.<br /><br />Please, do not do this to your children. Hug them and kiss them and be with them as much as you want, but don't hold them by force. Children need respect, space, kindness and choice just as we do.
B005VPRETE|5.0|Like many 5 year olds, my son is obsessed with Legos.  He has built virtually every Hero Factory guy and stages endless battles and adventures for them.  With duplos, he has built all manner of spaceships and fortresses and yeah, guns, and this Christmas he got the Lego Star Wars catalogue I mean Visual Dictionary, which is creating a huge problem for our annual lego budget.<br /><br />We won an auction at his school which included eight different Lego sets, including this treehouse.  At first he wanted to give it to his best girl friend for her birthday, but after looking at it for awhile, he decided he wanted to build it.  Why not? he asked. I like treehouses, and I like flowers (he is a gardener like his father), and I like building things.<br /><br />I hear a stuff coming out of his mouth sometimes which alarms my feminist heart (boys are like this, girls are like that), and I was one of those parents who was offended at the idea of Lego for Girls (it reminded me of the brilliant Chess for Girls SNL skit).<br /><br />But this morning walking to school, he told me what a great toy it was, and it wasn't just for girls, but for girls AND boys, and he doesn't care what anyone thinks.<br /><br />So thanks, Lego, for teaching my son and important lesson about gender equity.

B002UJIY7A|4.0|It starts slow as the audience is introduced to several 30 something couples vagabonding it on vacation in Hawaii. About an hour into the movie there is a palpable sense of menace. It delivers with some nice twists in the last 30 minutes. Lots of great Hawaiian scenes in between. Give it a try - if you can take movies with a bit of character development and the patience to wait through a story - you'll probably like it. I wish there were more thrillers like this out there. It's pacing is kind of a throwback to the 70's and 80's. It may not make sense but in a way it reminds me of Pacific Heights with Michael Keaton and Matthew Modine - although not that good.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it was a very good game. I love it. it has a few problems but it passes the time especially when u have children.
0307957934|2.0|Not as good as Michael Crichton's Prey - which itself wasn't that good. Other than the Swiss investigator, and some of the VP's of the hedge fund, none of the characters were involving - least of all the CEO-Billionaire genius protagonist. Make me care about someone or something, then I'll follow your story.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a fun way to waste time. some of the levels are better than others and some are pretty easy.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a good start but it's a long way to 101. Some games are hard to play on the kindle though.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love using evernote on my kindle fire.  It comes in handy for things I do at work.  Saves me time!
B0002V7O3I|5.0|I loved this movie when I was a kid and its still good now that I'm an adult. It has a good plot plus its cool to see Ethan hawks and river phoenix. Plus the alien is pretty funny. Great family movie
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It's fun and easy to use. I think everyone who likes solitaire will also enjoy this game.
B005ZUR724|5.0|I don't know why people don't like this game. if you like world of warcraft you will like this. the updates are fine and it works great on the kindle fire. I didn't have to update at all. the is also definitely worth $7 and $3 every 6 months. i definitely recommend it
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I enjoy mahjong and the variety of tile styles makes this game even better. the quest mode, where you earn little rewards is cute.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is a lot of fun and has a lot of game options to keep it fresh and changing.
B004O4K4SQ|2.0|so boring - move right move left - dodge this dodge that - give me a break<br />--- won't save to sd card 12gig
B005DD7H50|5.0|Read some of the reviews and figured I would check this out and wow, am I glad that I did! Was thoroughly entertained throughout the entire movie. Would highly recommend this to anyone looking for something out of the ordinary and thought provoking.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Puts a new twist on the old school Space Invaders! Very fun and the trash talking is funny. Great job!
B005ELQVGW|5.0|This album is incredible! Her music is very unique and worth listening to if you aren't already. You should start with her older material and progress towards her newer work. Trust me, you will love it!
0307595862|4.0|It's always a bit of a letdown when you're able to solve a mystery before all of the players are even introduced, and yet, somehow the journey through Jo Nesbo's \\"The Snowman\\" was no less intriguing. This Norwegian thriller is fast-paced, decently-written and developed, and will make you look twice at every snowman you see this winter! And while Harry Hole is no Lisbeth Salander, he still serves as a wonderfully intriguing, multi-faceted character to draw you into Nesbo's series (better late than never, no?).
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have the YouVersion Bible on my Kindle Fire &amp; my Droid X &amp; so happy with them both!! I use them at church, Bible Study, anywhere! I love, love, love this app!!
1594744769|5.0|I just finished reading this book and was very surprised at how much I liked it.  I don't usually like novels with pictures in them but this was the exception.  This was one of those books once I got started reading, I couldn't put it down.  The ending was good and I hope he writes another one.  I felt like with the ending of the book, it would be very easy to continue it on as the children try to find another loop.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed for a following book.
0374275637|5.0|I have thuroughly enjoyed reading this book. I read it after listening to an interview with the author on NPR. I think his approach of establishing System 1 and System 2 as abstract representations of lazy primative Intuitive thinking versus engaged focused Deliberative thinking was critical to my appreciation of his book. This model set the context for looking at his clear examples, revealing questions, tests, and research. I think his main point is that if we are ever going to understand how the mind works, we need to have a vocabulary and framework to support the discussion. I think some of the harsh reviews of this book can be attributed to the struggle of realizing the limitations of ones own mind (fast or slow, fast-genious or slow-moron, fast-moron or slow-genious). Daniel humbly makes it clear that he learned about his own fast & slow issues; reading his book certainly help me understand that there are times to think fast, there are times to think slow, and there are times we make mistakes just because we are inherently lazy thinkers. I found the book enlightening and fascinating!!
B006ON41FC|5.0|fun addiction. it keeps me occupied while standing in a long line. would definitly recommend this app for purchase! love it
B005D0RDIE|5.0|My husband loved this . He sat and watched it and laughed . This is one of his favorite bands and it was a nice surprise for him .
0062082353|3.0|I believe Chris Kyle is a magnificent SEAL and an outstanding American patriot. I further believe his Authors did him a dis-service in the way they presented his story. Fabulous content. Poorly presented.
B0068RHGJM|5.0|It was awesome . My son was very happy with it and listens to it over and over again. He looks forward to getting the next CD. This band is awesome and we wish they would do more concerts in the United States.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Thought they would be in separate cases, but when they came, they were in one case. I actually like that more. Very compact and better than I expected!
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|this is one of the best mobile games I have ever played. I had radiant litebfor my g1 bcuz I was to poor to buy the full version but developer even tho I got the version free I will be purchasing this to show u support....great game
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is ok but you shoud not have to earn games you should be able to do whatever you want, but they don't aloe that of course
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game. Wish you started with a few more gamed opened. My kids also like playing. Can't wait till I get all of the games opened.
B006MQRLSA|1.0|I really wanted to like this movie. Brad Pitt is a wonderful actor and the premise - based on a true story - was promising.<br />But it was BORING. Character develpment was nil. The players and managers are one-dimensional characters and I couldn't bring myself to give one iota of feces about them or the team. Players were moved around like chess pieces, or slaves bought and sold from one state to another.<br />And finally, <spoiler ahead> the \\"ground breaking\\" statistical method for making a winning team - for cheap and shorting the players - didn't ultimately work. The A's lost. There was some obligatory heart-warming nonsense right at the end, something to do with Brad Pitt's character and his daughter in the movie, but I shut it off by then because I couldn't bring myself to care.<br />I suspect Brad Pitt played the part very well - he seemed authentic. I just couldn't bring myself to care. If you think organized, big-money sports are a care-worthy topic, you'll probably enjoy this movie. I don't, so I didn't.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Great game... To the h8rs complaining that they don't know what weapon does what: GET OVER IT. A retro classic would have some guesswork in it. Remember when you couldn't go online and look up every detail of a game? Right. It's like that. 5 stars and a great change from the Crap of the Day Amazon has posted lately.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very good its hard to find a game like<br />this you need skill a mind and most important thumbs<br />but ive played a lot of games but out of all of them I like this one the best
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I enjoy having the Bible app on my phone and kindle. It really comes in handy when you need to get to hour Bible and u don't have one with you. The part is how easy it is to find the books and scriptures!!!!!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Enzo is a very bright dog, having been widely educated by television programs (the Weather Channel is not just about the weather, but about the world). Enzo is a faithful companion through to the end of his family's misfortunes. He understands how he is needed, and though he cannot speak to show his support, he communicates through gestures, some small, some grand, depending on the situation. Enzo reminds me of my own dog, and how wonderful it is to have a companion who is truly faithful and full of unconditional love. If you have ever loved a dog, you will love Enzo, and appreciate hearing a story from his perspective.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider solitaire is lots of fun.  It's a nice way to pass time. I like the choices for platting, too.
B003P2WO5E|4.0|If you're familiar with Sanderson's works you'll know that in general there are a few main characters and the books are all written from the perspective of those characters. However, it seems like he's decided to go with a several main characters (4) instead of just 1-2 as before as well as including perspectives of minor and seemingly inconsequential characters. This makes it a bit harder to keep track of all the story lines, and required some rereading on my part after I had gone through the book the first time.<br /><br />However, all this combines into a complicated tapestry filled with intrigue that only begins to become clear at the end. Bear in mind though, that they do leave quite a bit of the story shrouded in mystery, and all the signs point to this being at least a trilogy. That being said, it's hard for me to give this book a perfect score since I tend to look at the entire series of books rather than the individual parts, especially when it is clearly written as such. But given how it's been going so far, I'm pretty excited for the next book of the series.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Keeps all my thoughts together and lets me access them on all my devices. Good app to organize and track all of.your stuff.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Very nice cover.  It stands up nicely, its not bulky, keeps my Kindle Fire protected.  Definitely a two thumbs up.
B0052U59F4|2.0|I am not a stanger to erotic fiction. I try to keep an open attitude to the \\"Story\\". The 1st 75 pages were fun and informative, if a bit repetitive (yeah, we get it, he was \\"HOT\\"),good characterizations, ok descriptions. Then, a complete 180 degree turn, in sex acts, in language, in attitude towards women, in discriptive word usage. I wish I had been forwarned. I could not get over or around the next 50 pages. I felt no wicked joy, no sense of learning and no wish to find out what happens to Ana. I acknowledge that I have not read this author/genere before but I read the Stigg Larsen Series(The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest) and did not feel this amount of distaste.
B006M4F67A|5.0|This is a very relaxing version of mahjong with soothing music in the background. It is easy, but not very challenging.
0446573019|5.0|I loved this new character John Puller.  Yes according to the other reviews he was similiar to Lee Child (Jack Reacher) character but I thought he was a little like Michael Connelly (Harry Bosch) character also.<br /><br />The story kept your attention, fast paced and good read.<br /><br />The complaint that David Baldacci is copying Child's character, are other author's not having similar story lines.  Fern Michales (The Sisterhood) and Catherine Coulter (The FBS Series) to name just a few. Does that prevent me from reading, no ...after you get into the story lines you feel like its your favorite TV shows where you turn in each week to catch up.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this new character John Puller and hope to see more stories about his and his brother.<br /><br />Would also like to see more Sean King and Michelle Maxwell series.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I got this on kindle fire and I love it. U soooo need get this.I love it and u need to get it
B000005RS0|5.0|Tina Turner is one of the best and most important female artist in rock and roll history. She had alot of hits with her abusive late huband Ike but when she dropped the dead weight she really went from diva with a little ''d'' to diva with a big ''D''. Private Dancer is one of the best 80's albums EVER!. I love every track and Tina looks so pretty and fit on the cover.<br /><br />My Faves<br /><br />1. I Might Have Been Queen<br />2. Whats Love Got To Do With It?<br />3. Show Some Respect<br />4. I Can't Stand The Rain<br />5. Private Dancer<br />6. Better Be Good To Me<br />7. Steel Claw<br />8. I Wrote A Letter<br />9. When I Was Young<br />10. Don't Rush The Good Things<br /><br />This is one of my favorite albums. A true classic
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Droid X.<br />Works great, fun game. Great FAOTD. Don't think I'd pay for it, but today I didn't have to! Highly recommended.
B00005M989|5.0|If your not a big Prince fan and only like his mainstream hits, then this is for you. All his biggest hits are here like ''1999'', ''Kiss'', and ''Purple Rain''. All of the songs are on point and if your a fan (big or small) you will enjoy this.<br /><br />My Faves<br /><br />1. Little Red Corvette<br />2. Raspberry Beret<br />3. Gett Off<br />4. Cream<br /><br />Prince is the greatest artist living and I've seen him four times in concert. Real music is alive.
B0063IH60K|4.0|good game overall.  wish it was ad free.  would be willing to pay for that.  would love to be able to change the designs on the deck as well.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This is one of the best and most important rap albums of all times. I never really liked white rappers. They normally were gimmicks ( Ice, Ice, Baby?) but this album changed all that for me. There are songs on this album for everyone. Songs like ''Kim'', ''The Way I Am'' and ''Marshall Mathers'' are very bold, risky, and personal. I mean ''Kim'' is a harsh song but who hasn't thought about killing their lover at some point? There is also alot of humor as well. I really enjoy ''The Real Slim Shady'', ''Who Knew'' and ''Criminal''. Dude has a sick sense of humor. Other standouts are ''Kill You'', ''Stan'', and ''Drug Ballad''. I think this is a hip hop classic and it's one album every rap fan should own
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is very addictive. Well made graphic interface. one of the best for this type of games. highly recommended.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|Is great but needs the ability to utilize transparency, especially to hide folder names (for minimalist themes). I really like the notification feature, and the shortcuts, they're useful.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|keeps u entertained . great way to keep your mind going also. somewhat challenging. lots of fun to keep you busy
0525423656|2.0|I really enjoyed Matched and was very excited for Crossed.  However, it appears my excitement was the ONLY thing exciting about Crossed.  I find Ky and Cassia incredibly annoying in this book, I think the minor characters were more interesting.  The back and forth narration of Ky/Cassia didn't have enough difference in tone/voice as most times you couldn't tell who was speaking and had to back up to the beginning of the chapter to see if Ky or Cassia was narrating.<br /><br />I feel that most the words on the page were just that pretty words that didn't seem to go anywhere.  I'm hoping the following book will be interesting as I will finish out the series, to finish out the series.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|this is really awesome. a really.good.game. everyone should be getticng this game right.now! it is so good I liked it.so I played it every five minutes
B0063IH60K|5.0|Nice implementation of a classic game. Runs smooth on my ASUS Transformer Prime. It really works nice on the tablet.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Look no further than this app. It has everything you need. I love listening to the app. It makes me feel like I'm right there in the story.
B006T5FDLG|5.0|Alright I'm willing to forgive and forget the painful experience known as Lulu. This is more like the Metallica I know and love. Since it's only 4 songs it's not really a full album experience but just enough to get me fired up for a new full Metallica album.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Its a free,fun,and entertaining .You will really  like it.Kids like it to.Recommended for kids.Has a lot of games that you don't have to pay for.
B0009UC7QQ|5.0|It may sound corny, but in some ways this has become one of my favorite movies.<br /><br />It offers the opportunity to discuss moral issues: what right did the TV station have to control and display Trueman's life?<br />What is the basis for marriage and love, and what was the true role of his wife, actress, wife, friend?<br /><br />Trueman's is surrounded by people whose only purpose is to control him and to manipulate him. Everything in his life is pretend, except Trueman's himself.<br /><br />More than the movie, I loved the ending, and felt hope for all people who feel caught in situations where they can't find their way out.<br /><br />I do recommend this movie.
B003CN4R74|4.0|Like some of the other reviewers, this is not my favorite Evanescence album, but I do like it.  I'm very glad it comes with liner notes and lyrics.  Sometimes it's impossible to make out what Amy is saying, but it's always easy to sing along with her gorgeous voice!
B000AGTPUK|4.0|Perhaps I am more drawn to this movie because I new have a granddaughter living in upstate New York where every year they go on a family trip on a local train which has a version of the Polar Express.<br /><br />This magical movie involves a little boy who isn't sure Santa is real and a special train which takes him to visit the North Pole to discover the truth for himself.<br /><br />It is a great kids movie for children's young enough to enjoy a story about believing in Santa.
B0063GORYU|2.0|I enjoy playing Spider on my p.c., but on my Kindle the game steals my card sometimes and puts it where I don't want it.  That adds moves and costs me points.  I also dislike the ads.
B005UKJX4E|1.0|this movie is 2.5 hours long - if you cut out the crap it would be about 20 minutes long - might be the worst movie I have ever seen.<br />As the movie went on (and on) I kept waiting for it to improve - it never did
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Excellent game play. Easy to learn, difficult to master. You'll be ripping your hair out soon enough.<br />A bargain at 4.99.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game love it fun time waster I like to play it in my free time worth all of I
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|Movie was great quality, would easily buy again. It was brand new and played perfect. Purchased blue ray and I got it within the week
B004SIIBGU|5.0|It as a little hard to set up but when your done it is totally worth it!  I use it for 2 dollar bills and it works perfectly!
B00127RAJY|5.0|This workout is really affective. With it only being 20 minutes long, it's very doable! It's great for a beginner or for someone who got out of the habit of exercising regularly. I did find it difficult at first, but if you stick with it, it will get better. I can see a difference in my arms, shoulders and abdomen.
B004O4K4SQ|3.0|The gameplay is noice, and for a restored game the neon Colorado were ingenious to import. The shop consist of new weapons and things like and extra life. But so far i haven't seen any customize Space Ship options! 3/5 Stars
B0054JZC6E|5.0|these games are great. I really like that it requires your full attention to get through the levels. some are difficult but keep playing to get points.
B006ON41FC|5.0|A great way to kill time!!! My kids and I compete against each other to see who can fly farther.  Don't knock it 'till you try it.  Definitely a FUN game!!!!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love angry birds seasons. How cool that it is free. I will play this as much as I do the classic angry birds
B006ISJQ1W|1.0|this movie could have definately been better.Not that the actors were poor,but the content was lacking anything and everything to keep your attention.I had to get up and move around several times because I was getting bored about the fact that nothing made sense when all this movie ever contained was a bunch of drunks and nothing else .I rented this movie first before buying,and I'm glad I did,because this is one movie I will never buy. it could have been good to great.But I seen neithe good or great in this movie
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was an amazing well put together book and I'm looking forward to the next two in the series! When reading it's almost like you're in the arena with the tributes.
B006UG90RM|5.0|WOW! Ok, this isn't what I expected at all! Finally, Van Halen is back! Not only do we have crazy Diamond Dave back on the mic, but we also have Edward's valiant return to tone (Brown Sound) and creative playing. Once I got passed Tattoo and about halfway through She's The Woman, I yelled across the house to the wife... LISTEN!...NOW THIS IS VAN HALEN! She completely agreed with a two thumbs-up. For me the first four Van Halen records served as a sweet musical backdrop to those crazy High School days. I still proudly have all my Van Halen LP's starting with VH1 I got back in the summer of 1978.<br /><br />I wasn't really into that Van Hagar thing. I thought the band as a whole got to serious and polished sounding. Personally I thought Edward's playing style and tone changed once Sammy joined. They started writing lame ballads <yawn> using more keyboards....don't get me wrong, they did squeak out some good songs, but they just didn't seem like the same Van Halen I was used to.<br /><br />Buh-Bye Sammy! Gary Who? A Different Kind Of Truth brings us full circle! That raw hard rock that put Van Halen on the map is back and swinging! As I listened to each track on this CD, I'm just floored by what I'm hearing ... somebody pinch me this can't be true!! Track after track, David Lee is belting out his best on top of Edward's driving guitar.. and along with Alex & Wolfgang serving-up a powerful rhythm backbone that can melt plastic! This is one hard rocking album indeed! It's great to hear David Lee Roth singing with the band again. Edward's guitar playing on this record is phenomenal, he seems totally rejuvenated! I was concerned about the absences of Michael Anthony with his pounding bass and backing vocals, which always blended nicely with Roth`s. My concern was laid to rest when I heard Wolfgang play... and he can play no doubt. But still as being a long time fan Michael Anthony will be missed.<br /><br />I've read people whining about how most of this record is old dug-up material from their demo days and blah, blah, blah. Who cares! I personally like the old stuff and it doesn't sound dated to me one bit! On their next record I hope they keep digging....They obviously still have some good stuff out there to record. I love every song on this record... no hitting the skip button on this one, all five stars across the board.<br /><br />I also read people taking about the mix and all this and that .... this isn't a Ted Templeton production/ mix with a lot of reverb, and Eddie is only blasting out of your left speaker and echoing on the right. I do think it's a bit over compressed ... but other than that I think the mix is good. I hear all instruments perfectly fine with no digital clipping & distortion unlike Metallica's recorded disaster Death Magnetic.<br /><br />WELCOME BACK VAN HALEN! Thank you for the great release!
031618201X|5.0|Hello<br />  Tonight I was extremely lucky. I got to meet Gail Carriger at a book signing at a wonderful bookstore in San Francisco Ca. My sister bought the the new book timeless and also the manga and got both signed. Sorry cloud nine right now! Anyways the manga was much better than I expected. It stayed very true to the book, AND the plus part the art was very good. True it went faster than actually reading the book, but I enjoyed it immensly. Usually when they adapt the book into a manga they have a handsome cover then have someonelse do the actual manga. So in short good story and good art. As said in another review heed the teen warning. Not meant for young children or tweens.<br /> Have a good read!
B000002U8G|1.0|This CD was one of the worst of Pink Floyd I ever heard. Don't buy it! I gave it to my sister who is an avid fan and she thought this one stunk also.
B003Y5H556|5.0|The product came as described. It got here sooner than I expected which is always a bonus. Very happy with my purchase.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|Immediately force closes on the Galaxy Nexus with Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich.<br /><br />filler<br />filler<br />filler<br />filler<br />filler<br />filler<br />filler<br />filler
B000JSI7C6|5.0|This is an excellent movie, it is a great depiction of WWII and the code talkers. Even though like all war movies it is sad it is an incredible movie! I am not a huge fan of Nicolas Cage but I think he did an excellent job in this film 5 stars!
B0013ND30M|5.0|we recived the dvd faster than i thought we would, the movie is just as I remember it, still a great movie., and my 3 year old son loves the little music video extras..great movie and great deal
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|Sure it's overacted and not entirely plausible.....how can the jury find him not guilty when he admits to blowing up the building? Still one of my all time favorites.
B006ON41FC|4.0|liked it a lot. it works really well and is fun. I cant believe I am actually writing this blah
B006ON41FC|4.0|super super fun. love this game and play more then once every day but it crashes 2 out of 5 times. please fix!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app has me reading the Bible on a daily basis again. I have email notices sent to remind me. l'm doing three different reading plans. And, I love the bookmarks! All my favorite verses at my fingertips. I also like that I can have those verses in whichever translation I want - one that is familiar, learned from childhood, or one that leads me to a deeper understanding,
1555175163|4.0|This book was a perfect book for my 10 year old son to read and do a \\"Wax Museum\\" book report in Ip Man.  I will admit when he said he wanted to do his report on Ip Man I was nervous about finding him a resource, but this book exceeded my expectations.  Thanks.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This film is an emotional roller coaster, taking the viewer from the depths of pain and heartache to the peaks of what faith, hope, and trust in God can give.  Along the way, there are people to meet that experience the same doubts, frustrations, hopes, dreams and friendships that most of us share.  I laugh, cry, and pray every time I watch this truly wonderful movie!!
B004O4K4SQ|4.0|I am surprised. that this game hasn't gotten better reviews. Works well on my Kindle Fire, don't. see what everyone's issues with it were.
B004O4K4SQ|3.0|I just got the game and I really dint get the point of it I like the graphics,their pretty cool.but it wouldent be My first choice
B004O4K4SQ|2.0|Force closes everytime on Motorola Droid X, looks like a good game please fix this problem on the Droid X.  Thank you
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Highly recommended for those that like to stream to their tablet/phone. On a local wireless LAN, I am able to stream Bluray without a hitch, from my desktop.
B005Q1W10A|3.0|I was drawn in then pushed away for all the reasons others have said.  DA 2 was written from a 21st century perspective and it's characters would fit right in comfortably today.  Too bad.
B007B8GI28|5.0|I'm a huge fan of both the comic and the show. Even though they are slightly different, I feel like I get two visions of the same world. (It's a two-fer! Two-fer the price of one craaazy zombie world!!)<br />It's fun to watch every Sunday, the make up effects are incredible on the show! It's always exciting to see what kind of different zombie they come up with next.<br />The zombies are more or less part of the back ground, they are the set to this crazy apocalypse world.<br /><br />If you've ever watched a zombie movie or read a zombie novel and just wanted it to keep going and following the characters in this setting, then this show is for you! I highly encourage all fans to read the comics as well!!<br /><br /> (I just wish Amazon would consistently have it up and ready for purchase at midnight after it aired so if I missed it on TV I could get my Walking Dead fix sooner!!!)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to use menu, good choices of reading plans makes it easy to keep track of your daily progress. This is a great resource whether you are new to the faith or a life long Christian.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|Keeps force closing on my motorola atrix 4G. Installed several times and keeps force closing every time. So, I have to rate this app a 1 until it gets fixed. Looked like it might have been a cool game to play. I love retro style games and this game had that look to it.

B000JMLFLW|4.0|I understand that classics have their worth, but most of them bore me. Pride and Prejudice, however, is one of the few lit peices that makes me smile and want to finish it.<br />This book is free on Kindle-- there's absolutely no reason not to download it and give it a chance.

1416955070|5.0|This is a very good book. If you like fantasy, young adult, and a little romance all rolled into one, you will like this.<br /><br />The main character is young girl. She is suddenly exposed to a world of spells and runes and magic. She copes as best she can, especially when discovered that she's not just a normal human being-- she too, has magic. She is resilient and mentally strong.<br /><br />The boy is dark and sarcastic and very witty. He begins to change a little as he falls for the girl, but he tries to hide it, so that it holds his armored personality true. He is intellectual (reads a lot, quotes poetry), but also extremely physical (very agressive in combat).<br />I personally find him very likeable, charming and endearing.<br /><br />The story is full of believeable, interesting characters, each of which you become attached to and care for. The people and the world created by the author makes you want to jump into the book and live there.<br /><br />I realize that this book is a little expensive on the Kindle, but I would reccomend it.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|I dont understand why this game has three stars right now. This game deserves at least four stars. It was fun and very much worth it. I thank Amazon and Hexage Ltd, for making this game free for one day.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|The author did an excellent job of gathering information from a wide range of sources, most of them in person.  I learned a tremendous amount reading this book and there are many lessons to be learned by Steve Jobs' example - both things to do and not do.  I appreciated the honest portrait painted, however I couldn't help think that the author took a somewhat negative view of Jobs early on and that this became a central theme of the telling of his story.  But then again, Steve chose him, and he never really left anything to chance did he?

Today, he went poo poo on the potty and looked a little worried until I pulled this book out and showed him the picture of the mommy and daddy celebrating.  He was so happy and ran around the house saying \\"no more diaper.\\"  It's the first time he's confident pooping in the potty.

B005R5U5B2|5.0|First, I have to say that I am an \\"old\\" lady(35). Second, I used to work in the music industry and this is a wonderful pop CD. How these boys came in third on season 7 of the X-factor UK I will never know. America will never know the names of Rebecca(second place) and Matt(winner) but these boys have a chance of really catching on.<br /> Harnessing the power of social media they are an international sensation. The album isn't even out here in the U.S. yet but check out the shows they have been playing in the states online, and the audience knows every word to each song. Some people are going to hate them just because they are pop, they were so young(mostly 16)when signed to a label, they were formed by the x-factor judges(in my opinion one of the best things Simon Cowell's ever done) and each one of them is beyond cute/good looking.<br /> Louis,Zayn,Liam,Niall and Harry each have talent and can sing but put together it's something magical. This is a great debut CD with some wonderful production on it. Some of my favorites on this CD are the first release \\"what makes you beautiful\\" along with \\"One thing\\" \\"More than this\\" \\"Taken\\" \\"Tell me a lie\\" Seriously, every track is good and the last time that happened for me it was Adele. But let's be clear this is straight pop, so if you don't like pop you most likely will not like the CD.<br /> I am actually going to buy the \\"extended\\" CD that has the two \\"bonus\\" tracks as well when it comes out here in the states. This CD is pretty \\"G\\" rated too for any Mom's that worry about those things. I hope that these five boys are together for a long time and continue to make great music. I REALLY hope that they take off here in the states because honestly, they deserve it.<br />And when the trolls come and give this one star, and they will come. Don't be fooled it is worth giving a listen to, you just may find yourself becoming a directioner no matter what your age :)

1780484259|5.0|This was a gift for my boyfriend-- The day before his birthday I purchased the books and though he received them the day after his birthday, he was completely shocked and extremely happy and appreciative that he had received these books as a gift. Needless to say, seeing him happy made me happy, so I'm EXTREMELY pleased with my purchase. The one tiny thing I wish was different was that they all came in a series pack and were all either hard cover or soft cover. The series pack of the first 4 books were soft cover and then A Dance With Dragons was hard cover and just bigger in size than the other four books. He didn't seem to care though so that's cool. I just think it would have made for nicer presentation but that's just me. I'm completely satisfied with this purchase though.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I have been playing this game for around an hour straight now. I cant stop playing it! Its fun, addicting and espacially a great time consumer!

B004K4IZ3G|2.0|This is Matrix-lite, built on the flaws of the two Matrix sequels.  The rules are made up as the story goes.  Sure, it's science-fiction, but the story should at least make sense.  All flash with very little substance--highly disappointing.

B0051MKNV8|3.0|When I watched this, I quickly got the feeling that it was a sort of retelling of the Legend of Faust. He gets it all: money, women, power, in exchange for his life as the pill slowly makes him sicker.  I thought the ending would be of him dying or something, so the actual ending kind of upset me.<br />The moral of the story: cheaters always win. Plus, like someone else pointed out, it was almost like they were promoting drug use. YES, I watched the whole movie; I know that it was a mind enhancing drug that allowed you to use more of your brain power, but it was basically like any other drug. It made him sick and addicted.<br /> But using the powers that the drug gave him, he sidestepped his punishment (death) even though he pretty much deserved it. What he didn't deserve was to live on with no consequences. It's not only the moral issues that bothered me, but also the fact that they left plot points unfinished. Like what happened to his ex-wife and who killed that woman? It was a rather interesting movie, just morally unethical. I wouldn't advise showing this movie to children.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like the way this app moves quickly. It has plenty of fun options. and is really easy to navigate.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|Good Game if you like your old school rpgs.  Reminds me of all the good Ps one rpgs.  I recommend this game.
B007CGLRWA|5.0|Very low - key, yet the viewer feels on the edge of a precipice throughout the film.  Deeply damaged characters made somehow beautiful because of these private afflictions - or more perhaps for just doggedly being able to keep moving forward in what seems to be a pointless and uncaring world.  I have a feeling this will me more appreciated with time; it almost seems a documentary of the abysmal state of education and the grim challenges teachers and their students face today.  Solid performances by a surprising cast; Brody is a standout along with Caan and newcomer Sami Gayle.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|Program force closes as soon as its opened.<br />Tested on Epic 4g. This app is clearly still in the beta testing phase and not ready for a wide spread roll out.
B0028DRGDQ|4.0|Made by up and coming Mexican filmmakers (so I read), (REC) was quickly made in Hollywood as \\"Quarantine\\".  While I did like that film, this original is so visceral and authentic; I do think it's better.  Certainly the acting is first rate, beginning with Manuela Velasco as the news reporter assigned to the firehouse.  The rest of the cast is excellent including some older crazy ladies who become zombie-like killers.  The \\"shaky cam\\" stunts are old school now thanks to \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" but used here it is clearly effective.  Maybe this should have won an award for best use of a dollar, err...peso in 2007.  Pretty scary stuff, even when you know it's coming.  P. S. - Skip the sequel!
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|If you buy advent children make sure you get the Bluray version because it's packed with so much more. They actually shorten the movie for the DVD version. The Bluray version has the full movie, with much more back story. It has compilations of the previous FFVII games as well.

B005HSG3TC|4.0|I ordered this cover to replace a portfolio type cover I had previously used for my Kindle Fire. This cover is very form fitting for the Kindle, which snaps right in, conveniently leaving the On/Off button, the charging port and the Headphone jack exposed whether open or closed. The inside of the front cover is soft felt, which keeps the Kindle screen protected from scratches. The outside of both the front and back cover is a rubberized plastic hard shell. The front cover is held in place by an elastic strap, and folds in half to provide the Kindle with a landscape stand. I carry my Kindle everywhere, and it sets up easily in this case to read, web surf or watch videos on any flat surface. The only reason I do not give it five stars is I feel the price point is a bit high.
0385534639|5.0|I loved every minute of reading the Night Circus.  I particularly enjoyed the author's ability to describe both the mirth and sadness in each of her characters.<br /><br />As an aside, I picked this book up because a fellow Tarot reader recommended it to me and I must say that The Night Circus makes better use of tarot than any other work of fiction I have read.  Rather than a dire reading culminating in the Death card that comes true because of what heroes try not to do, we have several intricate readings sprinkled throughout the book that speak to the complexities of life and the different layers of meaning and emotion present in a situation.<br /><br />I heartily recommend this book to everyone.

B004WCTLNY|4.0|The Adjustment Bureau, directed by George Nolfi and starring Matt Damon and Emily Blunt, is something of a rarity - a romance movie within a sci-fi setting that actually works. The reason for this is that while The Adjustment Bureau is nominally based on a short story - \\"The Adjustment Team\\" - by Philip K. Dick, at its heart its true roots are to be found in Michael Powell's 1946 romantic fantasy film Stairway To Heaven (also known by its original UK title A Matter Of Life And Death), where two people who meet by chance and fall in love must deal with divine powers bent on seperating them.<br /><br />A rising young New York politician, David Norris (Matt Damon), on election night of his first senate bid, has a chance meeting with a young dancer Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt) that changes his life. But unfortunately he comes away from the encounter with only her first name and nothing else, leaving him no way of finding her. One morning, a short time later, we become aware that a group of men, all wearing hats, seem to be taking a strange interest in Norris. One of them, who goes by the name of Harry (Anthony Mackie), has been given the strange assignment of making sure Norris spills his coffee on himself by 7:05AM. Things, however, do not go as planned, and as a result, two things happen: (1) Norris runs into Elise on the bus, this time getting her phone number, and (2) Norris inadvertently stumbles across the existence of the Men In Hats in the act of manipulating events in his life. And is told by them that he must never reveal what he has learned to anyone, and that he must never see Elise again because it's not part of their plan for him. And because seeing her will not only ruin their plans for him, it'll ruin the bright future they have planned for her as well.<br /><br />The cast is excellent and is a large part of what makes The Adjustment Bureau work. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt project a believable chemistry of two people who from the first moment know they were always meant to be together. John Slattery (best known from TV's Mad Men) is perfect as Richardson, the officious leader of the team of agents managing Norris' life. Terrence Stamp is marvelous as always as Thompson, the hard-nosed trouble shooter nicknamed \\"The Hammer\\" who is brought in when things really go awry. But it is Anthony Mackie who gives the movie a lot of its heart as Harry, the low-key agent with doubts about the plan. Mackie never raises his voice, never lets Harry's feelings show on his face, but conveys everything with his subtly expressive eyes.<br /><br />There are also a host of cameos of public figures from the political and media arenas, meant I suppose to make things more realistic, but in truth they're incidental, particularly in a film like this where a good deal of suspension of disbelief is necessary. Still, some people will have fun seeing how many they can spot. I counted at least eight.<br /><br />As enjoyable as The Adjustment Bureau is, it does require certain periodic suspensions of disbelief which I cannot dwell on without revealing certain parts of the plot. And while it does at least toy with questions of free-will vs predestined fate, in the end it is a romance story and does opt for the ending that most easily satisfies. It might have been a deeper, more complex movie if Nolfi had had Norris make a less conventional choice, either choosing to stay with the plan the Men In Hats have laid out for him, giving up love for career, or sacrificing his own chance at happiness so that Elise can have the grand career he knows is awaiting her.<br /><br />Anyone who has seen Stairway To Heaven will instinctively know how this all turns out. Highly recommended for anyone who loves a good love-conquers-all romance story set in a very different reality from the one we know.e always meant to be together.

B004XQO90O|4.0|On the surface, the trailers for Source Code give you the impression of an action film dealing with themes that have been done before in other sci-fi - and fantasy - films and shows like Groundhog Day, Quantum Leap, Frequency, The Matrix and others. And while Source Code does involve ideas that have already been done, it does it in ways that raise it head and shoulders above most films in the genre, mainly in the way its characters react to the situation they find themselves in, and in the extremely fine performances given by Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Monaghan, Vera Farmiga, Jeffrey Wright and a host of others. You believe in their characters, and because of that, you believe the situation they're in and you come to care about them.<br /><br />I have to be careful not to give anything away because a lot of Source Code comes in a series of revelations, so I'll limit the set-up to what you can see in the trailers. The film begins with a man named Colter Stevens (Gyllenhaal) suddenly waking up on a train, not seeming to know where he is. His confusion only increases when he finds a woman sitting across from him, Christina (Monaghan), thinks he is someone else, a friend of hers named Sean Fentress. Disoriented, Stevens makes his way to the bathroom, only to find his reflection in the mirror is that of Fentress, whose ID he finds in his wallet. His immediate confusion comes to an abrupt end moments later when the train is ripped apart by a bomb, killing him and everyone on board.<br /><br />Or so it would seem, until he wakes up again, this time in some kind of military-esque environment pod, where we learn that Stevens is an Army helicopter pilot and his last memory, prior to waking up on the train, was being shot down while on a mission in Afghanistan. On a computer screen in the pod, a female Air Force officer, Captain Goodwin (Farmiga), begins talking Stevens out of his confusion. Stevens learns that he's part of a program called Beleagured Castle, and that he's being used to try and stop a terrorist who, having blown up the train, is planning on detonating a 'dirty' nuclear device in downtown Chicago in a matter of hours. The scientist behind Beleagured Castle, Dr. Rutledge (Wright), has devised a technique involving quantum physics which allows them to create a \\"source code\\" version of the train bombing and to insert Stevens into the body of Fentress, a passenger on the doomed train, eight minutes before the bomb goes off. And they have to keep inserting Stevens back in again and again with the mission of finding the bomb and, more importantly, finding out the identity of the bomber behind it, before the threatened detonation of the nuclear device is carried out.<br /><br />A love interest unsurprisingly develops between Stevens and Christina, but it's handled in a way that you can actually believe it. But for me, the most moving parts of the film are the interactions between Stevens and his military handler, Goodwin. Gyllenhaal and Farmiga give outstanding performances as a soldier trying desperately to understand what is happening to him and the sympathetic officer who is in the difficult position of keeping him focused on the mission while knowingly withholding information from him that could jeapordize his ability to complete it.<br /><br />A lot of talent went into Source Code and it shows. The director, Duncan Jones (this is his second film after the highly regarded Moon) gets the pacing just right, instinctively knowing when to speed things up, when to slow them down, and how to let things unfold, always keeping you engaged with the characters. The writer, Ben Ripley, makes his first real mark here in giving Source Code's characters a level of human depth and believability that most films of the genre lack. Ripley gives the sci-fi aspects their due, but knows that the heart of any film is in the characters and in how the audience connects with them. And the evocative musical score by Chris Bacon is deftly done, addingto the mood of a scene while never overwhelming or distracting from what's happening.<br /><br />Note: a nice nod in the film to the TV show Quantum Leap was the choice of Scott Bakula, who played Sam Beckett, as the voice of Stevens' father.<br /><br />Overall, well done, highly enjoyable, and highly, highly recommended.to the mood of a scene while never overwhelming or distracting from what's happening.<br /><br />Note: a nice nod in the film to the TV show Quantum Leap was the choice of Scott Bakula, who played Sam Beckett, as the voice of Stevens' father.<br /><br />Overall, well done, highly enjoyable, and highly, highly recommended.
B006GGR5QY|5.0|I confess to an absolute and irresistible attraction to the music of Olafur Analds. Living Room Songs is his most recent, and certainly one of his most beautiful artistic musical creations. This music is Classical. Spare: mostly piano with a violin and/or cello or viola, with the exception of one of the songs that has a slightly percussive pulse underlying it. Otherwise this is music for contemplation and/or ambiance (should you be) otherwise engaged. For me this is music that soothes & centers, yet also quickens or elevates because of its sheer beauty and economy. Mr. Analds has a grasp of the words space & silence as do few musical artists I have ever had the pleasure of listening to. I have only one reservation, and its not enough to make me give this album less than a 5 star review, but its still worth mentioning: at twenty-three minutes give or take, its simply one of the shortest cd's I've ever purschased. Sampled and then purchased on Amazon: highly recommended.

B00475AYJQ|2.0|*SPOILERS*<br /><br />I wanted to like this book. The first book was compelling enough for me to buy Day Two, but in the end, I was quite disappointed.<br /><br />Too many opportunities for clear narrative and character building were instead wasted on blather and empty descriptions. Lengthy repetitions and unnecessary filler. The editor could have taken out 2 or 300 pages I am sure with no loss of meaning.<br /><br />I read it to the end in hopes of a conclusion even though I knew he would repeat his one idea over again, and sure enough, that was that.<br /><br />I started this one day at Powell's City of Books in Portland as their descriptive tag had him classified as the new hot author in line with George Martin, etc. but I must say that was written better than any part of the books I just finished reading by Rothfuss.

This unit is the perfect setup for me, the big volume knob is great to control the powered monitors I have hooked up the balanced outputs (eliminating the mixer I was using), and the analog outputs sound great. I have only tracked a couple of things with the mic preamps but they sound good as well. All in all good value for money.

I was a bit lost understanding subnetting and trying to figure it all out by the \\"anding\\" of 1 and 0's.  Then I found this book and it cleared it right up.  He's right - it IS easy.<br /><br />In addition to his clear and concise explanations, there are PLENTY of examples and practice problems (with detailed answers following each chapter).  This book is a necessary companion to any serious Cisco student.  Thanks Todd.

B0061JPYX2|4.0|Ms. Winehouse is one of the best vocalists in the history of music. Although it's a shame she left us at too early of an age, These songs on Lioness leave us with what she was working on and different versions of a few faves. Altogether its great to hear from the songstress after the tragedy, but the c.d. is lacking a few great great pieces like Frank and Back to Black but if you are a fan it's a definite buy.

B0064Z62R0|5.0|Chillingsworth, Kane, Pahanui are THE top stars of traditional  slack- key guitar players. Each player would keep their tunings a secret, sometimes untuning the strings each time they were putting it away, so no snoopy person might discover what it was.  Really wonderful collection os songs they collected for this soundtrack! I was excited when I was watching it and heard one great song after another that I had picked up the first time I went to Kuaui. I caught some live music up in Hanalei one Sunday afternoon, and besides the first helicopter ride I had there, that was a memorable experience.  Pick this up. It's a great primer for hearing the greats! These songs are mostly from '20's and '30's, but some of the songs they play go back into the 19th century.

1250004217|3.0|The retelling of Holocaust stories regarding the apathy or fear or mass brainwashing of non-Jews is always heartwrenching. We all wonder, in retrospect, how so many people could stand by and let it happen.  At the same time, we remark about the exceptionally brave few who tried to help.  That said, the plot is just way too predictable to be good writing.  It's an OK read.  Just OK.
B0059XTUVI|1.0|I wouldn't waste my money purchasing this movie.  If you really want to see it, wait til it comes out on TV or at least when it's available at a Red Box where it'll only cost you just over a dollar to rent it.  We found this movie extremely boring, really didn't think the movie would be more about dementia/alzheimers and not more emphasis of the contributions this woman had in history.  Even though Meryl Streep is a brilliant actress, my husband and I felt we should've picked one of the other movies at the theatre the night we went as this one was just plain boring.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|When the directors worked with the US Navy on a separate project, they dreamed up the idea for an accurate movie about the Naval Special Warfare (NSW) community, they realized that there just weren't actors that could fill the roles.  So they collaborated with the Navy and real NSW personnel to make this movie.<br /><br />A SEAL platoon goes hunting, trying to unravel a skein of drug dealers, arms smugglers, jihadis, a plot to commit atrocities within the borders of the US.  They deploy around the globe in order to stop a massive terrorist act within the US, and at the same time allow a glimpse into the personal lives of these men and their families, and the other service members that support them.<br /><br />As much as a SEAL recruiting film, it seemed like the NSW small boat guys were pitching their career opportunities too, and a cinematic exposition of the tools of NSW.  High altitude, low opening (HALO) parachuting, submarines modified to support SEALs, UAVs, and other equipment was prominently displayed, but it was clear that the equipment was only there to aid the men in their mission, and that no technology would replace their training.  Still, gadget junkies will get a fix with real rather than made-up hardware.  The boat crews, especially, seemed like they enjoyed their work greatly.<br /><br />The most intriguing character, and the most proficient actor of the Navy personnel was Senior Chief, the intelligence analyst/interrogator.  Of all the sailors in the film, he was the one that could be mistaken for a professional actor, but during his interrogation scene, one can understand why his specialty would give him the skills that transfer to performance.  This also made for an interesting subtext; the brutal torture by bad guys failed to get the subject to talk but the professional interrogation by the Navy interrogator broke the subject without the interrogator laying a finger on him.<br /><br />All in all, an excellent action flick.  The quality of acting generally wasn't stellar, but given the tax dollars spent training these men for their disciplines, that can be excused.  These were special warfare operators in a film, not actors pretending to be something they're not.<br /><br />E. M. Van Courtgenerally wasn't stellar, but given the tax dollars spent training these men for their disciplines, that can be excused.

0375869026|5.0|What a wonder of a book!<br /><br />First sentence:  I know I'm not an ordinary ten-year-old kid.<br /><br />August (Auggie) is 10-year-old born with a cranio-facial abnormality that, in spite of who he is inside, makes him stand out in a crowd.<br /><br />This is the story of his first year in school, told in the first person through various viewpoints - Auggie, his sister Olivia(Via), her boyfriend Justin, her friend Miranda, and Auggie's friends Jack and Summer.<br /><br />I love how this story is told in a realistic, \\"that's just the way it is\\" fashion - even Via, who is a teenager, pretty much rolls with the fact that most of the attention goes to Auggie - with all of the surgeries that he has had, that's just to be expected.  She's always stuck up for him, and never, until this first year of her going to a new high school, felt at all ashamed of his appearance.<br /><br />Auggie?  Well, he's just a great kid - a Star Wars fan, an XBox-playing, joke-making, pretty smart little dude who loves his family and their dog Daisy, bought off of a homeless guy for $20 by Auggie's father.  He has a loving and imperfect family, he doesn't feel sorry for himself (much), and seeing the world through his eyes made this reader even more grateful and appreciative.<br /><br />Of course we run into the casually (and not so casually) cruel kids and adults, but Auggie, who wasn't too keen on the idea of going to school, manages to make some friends, and, if he doesn't blend in, at least people get used to him.  Then a boy he thought was his friend seems to turn against him, and we all feel the hurt.  Another boy starts a bullying campaign, and here is where we see Auggie's true strength come to the fore.  His friendships are tested, and his friends make the reader proud.<br /><br />At the end of this book, and throughout the last pages, I was wiping away tears, the kind of tears inspired by hope and a touch of the happy.<br /><br />This book is geared to middle readers (8-12 years old), but is definitely one that everyone should read.  Teachers, homeschoolers, parents, and even adults - pick this one up - you will love it as much as I did.<br /><br />And you will LOVE Auggie!  This one will definitely be showing up on my \\"Best of\\" list for 2012; it's a winner all around.<br /><br />QUOTES (from an ARC; may be different in final copy):<br /><br />Auggie:  I know ordinary kids don't make other ordinary kid run away screaming in playgrounds.<br /><br />Auggie:  I think it's like the Cheese Touch in \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\".  The kids in that story were afraid they'd catch the cooties if they touched the old moldy cheese on the basketball court.  At Beecher Prep, I'm the old moldy cheese.<br /><br />Summer:  So I just went over and sat with him.  Not a biggie.  I wish people would stop trying to turn it into something major.<br />He's just a kid.  The weirdest-looking kid I've ever seen, yes.

B0064J6OMO|3.0|Believe it or not, but this lame screwball comedy has actually taught me a few things.<br /><br />First, Olivia Wilde will become one of Hollywood's leading lights, her onscreen luminesence even able to survive the outrageous stupidity of this movie.<br /><br />Second, Ryan Reynolds has deep insecurities as an actor, a complex not helped by the fact that she can't act.  How insecure is an actor if he has to be constantly told by fellow actors he's good-looking?<br /><br />Third, parenting sucks.  It really, really sucks.  It sucks so much that you're better off being an unemployed actor whose job is trying to figure out how to spend all those minutes unemployment gives you.
144234430X|5.0|This was a Stephen King book I loved listening to. Coming from Switzerland it was especially joyful to hear the narrator Craig Wasson use different dialects. Something hard for me to imagine when I'm just reading a book. The story flows so naturally, the details of \\"George's\\" Life in the late 50s and early 60s are great and made for vivid pictures in my mind. This book is once more proof, that it's not necessary to have a monster attack someone every 3 pages. 5 stars from me. The ending was especially nice and playing a couple of chords from Sadie's and George's song was a nice touch. Also something that speaks for the Audio Book version.
1595827684|5.0|Awesome awesome artbook! I'm a huge mass effect fan, so this book was truly exciting for me. I ordered it straight from the Bioware store (which I recommend everyone doing) bc they had a collectors edition version available with a limited edition clamshell case (only 1500 made), and an extra section dedicated to the Art of the comics! Go there and buy it now!
B004LWZW7E|1.0|Basically the story is set in the future and you have a life clock. And if your time runs out you die. The story was boring. And the acting was horrendus. I wasn't so surprised that Justin Timberlakes acting was bad. But Amanda Seyfried's acting was surprisingly worse than his in my opinion. This movie fell into the category of When is this ever going to end category. If you like Science fiction movies like this then watch it. Just don't expect the acting to be great or for this movie to be exciting because it wasn't.

0385344228|5.0|Defending Jacob is a excellent courtroom drama mystery. It starts slowly, drawing you in like an anaconda systematically squeezing its victim. By the time you reach the middle, you are trapped, the book stuck to your hands while the air is squeezed out of you. The story keeps changing as surprising revelations are casually dropped in your lap until you read the last two scenes with your mouth hanging open, finishing with a satisfying \\"Whoosh\\" for your last breath. Then the book lives with you for days afterward as you replay scenes in your mind. For me, that's what indicates a book deserves 5 stars. I highly recommend Defending Jacob.

B0064NTZQ2|1.0|Great Gertie's Nightgown, this one was as tedious a movie as I've ever seen--and I've seen some tedious movies.  The trailer seemed inriguing enough; the movie garnered some attention and recevied decent reviews.  All I can say about that is oh well.<br /><br />\\"Drive\\" is a movie about a stuntman/driver who does little \\"odd jobs\\" on the side which would involve driving a getaway car for robberies, heists, you name it.  And given that premise, you'd think the movie would be entertaining.  Again, you'd be wrong.  The title of the movie should have been \\"STARE,\\" because that's basically all Gosling's character does--he drives around and stares.  Oh, there's some contrived plot about him falling for his down-the-hall-neighbor (played by Carey Mulligan).  She's sending out all sorts of positive vibes--until her husband is released from jail!  Gosling tries to befriend the guy, and everything that could go wrong, goes wrong.  Then there's a motive of revenge involved and the situation gets even more complicated.<br /><br />Unfortunately, by the time this happens, I'd fallen asleep--TWICE!  The only redeeming quality of this movie were the performances by Bryan Cranston and Albert Brooks.  I think Cranston is one of the most underrated talents in Hollywood, and he was quite effective in the movie.  Albert Brooks was spectacular as a vicious mob boss.  Unfortunately for Gossling, it seems he has attended the Bruce Willis School of Acting.  He ran the gamut of emotions from A to A-minus.<br /><br />Directed by Nicholas Wilding Refn and lasting 100 hours, er, minutes, \\"Drive\\" just needs to be passed.
B000002ADT|5.0|Hard to believe that a record in 1958 may sound so good on a single CD. Another proof that audiofile formats are not necessarily required. my opinion
B003Y5H5FG|3.0|The (pardon the expression) revamp of this movie was not very well received.  It was released in that pergatory period for movies (early to mid-August) and it was at the theater and then--poof--gone.  That's a real shame because I enjoyed the movie.  The original, which I did enjoy more than the reboot, went more for comedy than actual horror.  \\"Fright Night\\" was a long-in-the-tooth local production hosted by Peter Vincent, fearless vampire killer (*nudge/nudge, wink/wink*).<br /><br />Colin Farrell plays Jerry Dandridge in the redo.  His character is not comedic; heck, he's not even all that friendly.  He is evil and he's in town to do evil things.  Following the plot of the original, he moves into the house next to Charley (Anton Yelchin) and his mom--sans his \\"goon\\" from the first picture.  He has not come to this suburb of Las Vegas to make friends and give \\"warm-fuzzies\\" to people.  He has come to repopulate his kind and he wastes no time in doing so.  And he's on to Charley quicker than a duck on a June-bug.  The director (Craig Gillespie) didn't waste time on having a love story between Jerry and Charley's girlfriend, which I rather enjoyed.  Jerry saw her as simply another meal.<br /><br />I don't quite understand why this version was publicized as a \\"remake,\\" because it was almost an entirely different story.  What worked in the first picture, wouldn't have necessarily worked in this one.  It was a different take and I enjoyed it.  Check it out.  The movie is rated R.  It has some gore (not much) and language, and that's about it.
0061438294|1.0|Reading this book is like reading an 'info-mercial' from start to finish. Yes, there are some body language reading cues that you will find, but they are far from earth shattering.  Overall it was a dissapointment.  The search for a good body language reading book continues.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I borrowed this book from the Kindle Lending Library on a Wednesday and was done reading it by Sunday (four days!) which means I read about 100 pages a day to finish this off and at no point did I get bored or feel like I had been reading for a long time (until my battery told me it was dying!)<br /><br />It was a bit brutal at times and there were times the descriptions made my stomach turn a bit but you were right there, imagining the world and putting yourself with or against the characters that were well developed. The story moves along and you don't feel a lull at any point.<br /><br />I have already started reading the second book and am just as intrigued.<br /><br />If you are looking for a compelling read you can't put down, try this series. It has definitely caught my attention.

B006PGL7OQ|4.0|Writer/Director Jeff Nichols has concocted a complex and powerful film with an excellent performance by Michael Shannon. Few films have succeeded this well in sustaining the mounting dread which the filmmaker and Shannon convey over a two hour running time. Jessica Chastain continues to impress as Shannon's long suffering wife who struggles to understand her husband's gradual decent into possible madness. While watching the film, I remembered Richard Chamberlain's lawyer in Peter Weir's film The Last Wave who also questioned his sanity while having visions of a coming apocalypse. Weir's film also does an excellent job of telegraphing impending doom but Michael Shannon's performance raises Take Shelter to another level of dread. Others have expressed some disappointment with the film's conclusion. Initially, I felt that the ending was a little too convenient but on reflection this feeling may have been caused due to the powerful buildup of images and emotions throughout the film. All this would probably diminish any denouement offered by the writer/director? Finally, this is one of the better films released this past year and certainly deserved more attention during its theatrical run. Hopefully this dvd release will expose it to more viewers.
0062082353|5.0|I could not put this book down.  He not only told of his experience as a sniper but also of the feelings of he and his family as he went on his duty each time.  This helps one to see that what they do affects many more people than just their personal life. I cannot imagine a person doing his job that he did and not having problems with his conscience.  He puts it all into words and makes you understand his love of country and dedication to his profession and fellowmen.  I have great admiration and respect for Chris and thank him from the bottom of my heart for all he has done for America.
1594203334|3.0|It would be nice to believe that all French kids are impeccably behaved, but personal experience tells me this is not the case. My brother in law (a German) married a French woman and they live in France.  They have two sons and when my husband and I vacationed with them, the kids were HOLY TERRORS!  They were 5 and 10 at the time, only ate French fries and drank soda at mealtimes and were so poorly behaved at the table that my brother in law would end up screaming at them to try to keep them in line. My sister in law, in the meanwhile, did absolutely no parenting whatsoever, choosing instead to chat with others at the table, while her kids misbehaved all over the place. This is my experience with French parenting.

So I said well I will get a sample for my kindle fire and see what the fuss was about. I have to say that its been a while since I read a book that just grabbed my attention like WOOL did. I read the sample and was instantly hooked. So I decided that if the first book was any indication on what all 5 were like then i better just get all 5 because I'm gonna be longing to read more! Excellent read, if you are a fan of sci-fi novels then you will love WOOL!

I, as a previous reviewer, turned the diono stiching so it was not showing. I would definately highly recommend this product.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King is the master of mystery and suspense and 11/22/63 continues the King tradition with much detail of the time frame in which the story takes place, a step back in time to the Cold War era of September 1958.  But the story initially begins during the twenty-first century in Lisbon, Maine and main character and literature teacher Jake Epping has a surreal encounter at Al's Diner.  And one asks, what is unique about the story?  King's novel centers upon time travel and the attempt to change history, especially the events surrounding the days before that fateful day in 1963 and thereafter.  And once again, the question pertaining to history arises, what if...<br /><br />As readers delve deep into each of the passages of the novel, King's writing is filled with much description of the past.  He focuses upon the material culture of his lifetime from Al's Diner and its \\"famous fatburger\\" to five and dime comic books and young boys that looked like James Dean that whaled back \\"Hi-ho, Daddy-O\\" (Kindle location 582).  With these major elements, they set the stage to King's story and historical backdrop that specifically drenches the reader with much novelty and nostalgia of the period that depicted another age of the innocence decades after the Victorian era; of course this is a King novel and there is plenty of irony that breathes similar to Back to the Future meets a \\"Twilight Zone,\\" \\"Quantum Leap\\" episode, and a King horror flick all rolled into one - consider the mysterious character the Yellow Card Man.  But what is interesting about Jake's accounts of his experience having stepped back into time to 1958, he can only relate to and understand what he is seeing, hearing, and eating from cable TV and the internet of his own time.<br /><br />11/22/63 is somewhat of an epic novel especially with over 800 pages of storyline that completely interconnects.  However, it will take much diligence and patience to read each chapter.  For this reader, it took more than a month to complete because of the meticulous detail that King has written.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|great app.  it can read aloud or u can read it yourself. easy to use. great for studying. would recomend it
B007E6YYLO|2.0|Ok, I must write this because I have find myself rather turned off from the show.  I will say I am a fan of the comics but surprisingly I have no problem with the show not showing a blood bath every 5 seconds like the comics.  What does bother me the most about the show is what the show likes to advertise itself on \\"its all about the characters.\\"  I feel that if they want to truly show this side like they did in the comics then they should not reuse already discussed problems.  I am bored of Andrea already.  She is predictable and her character has little or no significance anymore except to be someone to hate.  The reuse of the suicide issue I feel did not need to be brought up again.  Could we have not focused on immediate issues such as supplies, defense, finding information.  What do the other characters do (missing TDog) when they are not involved with baby issues, psycho Shane or crying Carol?  I feel that instead of stretching and elongating 3 central issues for 5 episodes.  They should have several issues that need to be solved.  Too be honest, they are only stalling the inevitable with Shane and Andrea.  Prolonging the solution to a very dramatic and horrific outcome ruins the shock or the luster of the solution to a conflict.  It does not help to build tension and therefore lessons the resolution.<br /><br />I also feel that this show needs to a radical change of pace.  More characters would be nice.  Hey new characters will bring more interesting problems.  Or the show can expand on the other characters and their (hopefully and refreshing unselfish) problems.  Finally, have them investigate, explore, scavenge the world around them.  This show can be more that 45 minutes of repetitiveness and then 15 minutes of action.  Don't give me more zombie fights, that is action without a purpose.  It does not help build the plot.<br /><br />I hope it improves but as this episode ended, I slowly became frustrated with the same issues being carried over and over again.  As it begins to stretch your characters look unintelligent and rather unimaginable.  Conflict resolution can save this series but I feel it should not be the finale that resolves everything.  Conflict resolution should be throughout the entire season and the finale should start more conflicts.<br /><br />These are my thoughts.  Thank you reading.  I hope for those who enjoy do not over react.

0385344228|5.0|How well do you know your child? Your wife? Yourself? In this breathtaking novel a D.A. has to ask himslf these questions when his son is accused of murdering a school classmate. He is sure his son is innnocent, so why is he hiding potentially incriminating evidence?<br /><br />The ending of this book will take your breath away. You will want to go back and re-read the book. A triumph!
B005P06AAO|4.0|I watched the entire series in one seating.  Where R.J. Berger was more laugh out loud in your face funny, Awkward was more subtle in its approach, choosing to build over time.  I was also annoyed by the bleeping out of words, though not enough to impact my review.<br /><br />Jenna (played by Ashley Richards) is faced with numerous \\"teen challenges\\" subsequent to kicking the season off with her first sexual encounter and then having everyone think she attempted suicide, as a result of a comedy of errors, including having found a mysterious note with hard core life advice.  Without totally recapping the plot, starting her sophomore year with her right arm inverted upwards in a cast and the rumors of her attempted suicide attempt, sets the tone for the year while also getting her \\"deflowerer\\" to DTR (AKA define their relationship). She has a hot (albeit enhanced) mom who had her while in her teens, 2-solid friends, an overweight cheerleader as a protagonist and another guy that really likes her (though is dating a hot blonde who made a chastity pledge).<br /><br />IMHO, what makes this work is that Ashley Richards is/was only 19-20 herself (and apparently graduated HS @ 15 and is a member of Mensa).<br /><br />On a personal note, having a pre-teen daughter myself, I can only hope (and prepare) that this will not be a precursor to endless worry!

B005WMQ5R8|5.0|My original review:<br /><br />Man, you are a damn lie. Just read your review and it's so wrong it's not funny. Right off the bat I could tell you who did it without even knowing his name, the director who did Kawajiri's World Record on the Animatrix DVD, only this movie, which did have a hell of a lot of color, had almost zero plot and the art, to tell you the truth, wasn't as good as World Record.<br /><br />To compare this to the live action Speed Racer is a nuclear overstatement to say the least. I will give this movie an official review of my own when I watch it again. This will be my third time watching it btw, not because it's all that but because the first time I fell asleep on it and the second time I didn't know what the hell was going on, besides the fact that some Spike Spiegel ripoff (Spike is the main character in Cowboy Bebop) with an Elvis 'do is on papers (probation) and is racing to stay out of jail. Of course he drops the F-bomb repeatedly and in between he's combing his retarded looking bouffant, like that's supposed to be \\"cool\\" or something or make me not feel so bad for plunking down 24 bucks for it. There's even a little fan service courtesy of a tit shot in the middle and a really empty could-have-seen-it-coming-a-mile-away throw in boy/girl romance rivalry.<br /><br />To compare this to Akira is shamelessly promoting this little ignorant anime. Honestly, I didn't think Akira had the best writing or story. The writing, particularly the dialogue, was downright ugly. But what made Akira so great for me was the density, the information packed in each scene and its overall consistency throughout.<br /><br />Artwise, Redline starts off with a bang and in the middle scenes there's a very noticeable dropoff, like off a cliff, in the quality and detail of the art. This is a decent anime at best, mediocre when compared to the likes of Ghost in the Shell, Paprika, Patlabor, Akira, Ninja Scroll, Wings of Honneamise, etc. A better comparison to this film is Dead Leaves, both hyper and very very loud. Imo, this director did a better job with World Record this may be due to the fact that he didn't write it.<br /><br />What I think now:<br /><br />I guess the 3rd time's a charm because this anime is great. All the comparisons to Akira had me comparing it to that film; the 3rd time I saw Redline enabled me to judge it on its own and I agree with the hype: this anime is all that and much much more.<br /><br />It's refreshing to see an anime that revels in being what it is, animation. Nowadays, almost no animator, with the exception of an endangered few, have the guts to keep humans in the loop, to actually hand-draw animation instead of jumping on the CGI 3D bandwagon. It's all mixed up: cartoons use CGI to look more real and live action films use it to make real actors look cartoonish. By deliberately eschewing these gimmicks, Redline goes back to the essence of why, as a 44 year old, I still enjoy these films as I did as a kid: they're just fun to look at. Pure escapism. In animation, I'm not looking for \\"real life.\\" I'm not looking for a cartoon that \\"looks real\\" as much as I'm not looking for a live action film that make actors look and behave like cartoon characters. Redline is as close to reading a comic book as you can get, only it's a moving, living comic book alive and vibrating with the wildest palette this side of Akira and when I say animation I mean ANIMATION; everything in this film is moving, everything, even little creatures and details in the background you can barely see.<br /><br />There is a decent plot here, not great, but this isn't what I expect from such a title nor will I describe what's described here many times over. It's fun. It's very detailed. Most of all, it's a comeback for Japanese anime imo. Like Akira, blood, sweat, and tears drip off of every shot of this film. Nothing compares to hand-drawn animation when it's done right like this film does. Animation's at its best when it acts as asupercharger instead of a copycat to reality. This anime reminds me of the type of old school animation made by the likes of Yoshiaki Kawajiri, particularly his short film \\"Running Man.\\"<br /><br />Like I said, changed my mind. Instant classic!supercharger instead of a copycat to reality.

0596009208|5.0|This book first of all is not for those that have never programmed. You should at least know SOME programming so if you ever done BASIC, Logo, JavaScript, Pascal, PHP, Perl or anything very simple this book will help you tremendously. Any introduction of any other programming book will start you of with the whole spiel of what programming is and how to do something simple but not this book, it starts off kind of hard but then explains things to you very logically and funny. It is very well written and you will remember things with it. So if you're a Java student and your textbook is too hard or whatever, choose this and you'll be on your way in no time. If you want a good introduction on programming in general, start with another book and then go into this.
B007E6YYLO|2.0|I hope people realize that there are only three more episodes left on the second season and that it has all pretty much taken place on the Farm of Their Discontent and been about Rick, Shane and Lori. That's pretty bad. I have said this several times with my reviews and I think it is finally dawning on people that this show really is no longer what it started out to be. Gone are the excitement, urgency and somber mood of the first season. Gone is the terrifying setting, the struggle to survive, to find answers, to dig deeper into questions about the human soul and the consequences of days gone by in the zombie apocalypse. I am all for character development but the characters in this show have all been facing a slow death, just as the show itself. T-Dog, Daryl, Dale, Carol and Glenn don't even appear on this episode anymore (that is half the principal cast) which I think is symbolic, more than anything else, as these characters have pretty much stopped mattering a long time ago vis a vis the petty, Lifetime Television for Women problems of the other three. The show has become all about Rick, Shane and Lori and that stagy, soapy love triangle between them.<br /><br />Rick and Shane - in a scene that reeked of Old Spice and ba/l+ls - pull over on a deserted road 18 miles out (why 18?) where they get to - in a very tes/tosterone loaded way no less - man it up and talk about their feelings over Lori; Lori - an unlikable, selfish and moronic character with no redeeming qualities and someone who has been the cause and source of a lot of misery and grief for a lot of people in this group - especially between Rick and Shane who are willing to kill each other over her. KILL EACH OTHER. In fact, watching these two beat the living hell out of each other 18 miles outside of the farm in some random location ravaged by the APOCALYPSE, as in END OF THE WORLD, over a woman, made me seriously question whether they both still deserve to live. These people are so short sighted and idiotic, they all just deserve to be gutted already and put out of their misery.<br /><br />Back at the good old homestead, where women know their place in the kitchen, Lori and Andrea have a profound conversation; the kind of conversation miso/gynist men imagine women should have with one another in an ideal world, which for the writers of this show is the post apocalypse. That entire conversation Lori and Andrea had in the kitchen was cringe worthy and insulting. My god it was like two 8th graders had written that lame, ineffective dialogue. It had no power and did not make any point or evoke any kind of intelligent thought. In fact, it made Andrea look bad, which is ridiculous. I couldn't believe Lori, as a woman of the 21st century, was giving Andrea a hard time for not sticking around the house washing clothes and cooking. And I couldnt believe that the writers had seriously nothing better to write about than reciting outdated, Victorian notions about how as a woman Andrea should basically know her place and let the big, strong MEN take care of the important stuff while she devotes her time to knitting and making a comfortable home for said protectors. Really? I mean no...REALLY? R.E.A.L.L.Y??<br /><br />It also seems like they are artificially extending the whole \\"Shane is the villain\\" story arc to make up for a lack of direction and originality.<br /><br />Firing Darabont was a huge mistake. A Hollywood Reporter article was talking about huge budget cuts imposed on the show and how the network repeatedly dumped all over Darabont's creative vision by imposing things like 50% of the shots occurring outdoors and 50% indoors (indoors being cheaper to film) and another note asked whether or not the audience had to always see the zombies - couldn't they simply hear them sometimes. It's been said that Darabont was involved in constant battles with the network to maintain the creative vision that drew so many fans to the series in the first place and that those fights eventually led to him being fired altogether.<br /><br />Cast members, who were not happy by Darabont's departure, and especially outraged at the network's calculated move to fire him right after Comic-con, were also reportedly harassed and warned about making any public comments on this. Afraid to be killed off and also pink slipped, they all obliged.<br /><br />All this would explain why the entire season has taken place on one farm instead of them moving and why there have been a minimal number of new characters - all of which would have greatly contributed to the quality of the show. This season just gives the whole show a bad name, which is a shame because Darabont did an amazing job introducing us into the zombie apocalypse and these characters who were all multidimensional when their journey began.
B001KX50BK|5.0|This is a great movie when you are looking for some very light comedy. Superb acting by both Julia Roberts & Richard Gere. It doesn't make any difference how many times I choose to watch this movie, I still come away with a very pleasant feeling. It is nice to watch something that you can just sit back with a bowl of popcorn and enjoy a great, great movie. I would highly recommend this to anyone.
B004QL7K6Q|1.0|Wanderlust is a lazy comedy about a New York couple George (Paul Rudd) and Linda (Jennifer Aniston) who find themselves unemployed and unable to pay for their too small-too expensive studio apartment -excuse me- microloft that they have just purchased. So they decide to abandon it and head south to Atlanta for a job that George's unbearable older brother Rick has set up for him. Along the way, they make a side stop at a kind of hippie bed and breakfast called Elysium. The commune is populated with all the stereotypical characters you see in comedies that poke fun of hippie culture. George takes a shine to it at first with its feel good, let it all go philosophy. Linda hates it of course. But they must have money so they proceed to Rick's house where poor George is subjected to Rick's lectures and overbearing nature because Rick is the success and George isn't. So they decide to head back to the commune where the tables turn and Linda starts loving the place and George hates it.<br />  Why? Because Linda has taken a shine to Elysium's alpha male Seth (Justin Theroux) and the prospect of free love with him. George is put off despite the promise of sex himself with the very attractive Eva (Malin Akerman). In a cringe inducing moment, George actually has to psyche himself up for it by talking dirty to himself in the mirror and then torpedoes the whole thing when he can't stop talking dirty to Eva turning her off. Of course why would any one need extra encouragement when it's Malin Akerman? Oh well.<br />  Then there's some artificial drama concerning a big corporation wanting to take over the land Elysium is on. That leads to your typical plot twist about who's helping them (hint: one of Elysium's members) but it's all handled like an afterthought.<br />  The problem with this flick is for one; the filmmakers chose an all too easy target (hippies) and instead of coming up with creative jokes they try to get laughs by showing how disgusting it's all supposed to be. For instance, when a couple who had recently given birth to their first child decide not to cut the imbilical cord and let it fall away naturally, they show up to the dinner table with the child and the cord still attached. Other jokes involve vegans and drinking concoctions made with roots and berries. There is one clever joke where Linda and Elysium's co-founder Carvin (Alan Alda) sneak off to a diner to eat \\"real\\" food including a plate full of sausages, steak and other meats.<br />  And course there are jokes involving nudity which leads to some full frontal discomfort mainly because the streakers are elderly or out of shape.<br />  Anyone who saw the red band trailer on YouTube (including me) will realize there are scenes missing from the final film. And the Mr. Skin crowd hoping to see Aniston topless will be dissappointed. So you may get the sense that the movie is a lot tamer than it could've been.<br />  Too bad too because Rudd and Aniston have real chemistry as a couple and are trapped in a script with trite jokes and no imagination at all.<br />  Bummer dude.

If you haven't read it, read it now, and if you have, read it again!

B00656C6KK|5.0|This is a wonderful compilation.  I couldn't wait to play it as soon as I received it.  I've been a Doris Day fan for years.  This CD just made me realize just why I enjoy her work. The tunes are great, and Miss Day is in very good form.  I especially enjoyed her words before the song sung by her late son, Terry Melcher.  It was a very special treat.

0553801473|1.0|Once upon a time, George Martin created a pretty compelling fantasy world run by the most interesting politicians since the Borgias. The first book was great. The second book was great. The third book was pretty good, too. But the fourth was, at best, tepid and, truth be told, seemingly thrown together. Martin told us we had to endure Crows to set up the payoffs promised in upcoming volumes 5 to 7. And then came volume 5, a travesty that makes Crows seem like Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />I could, in the Martin manner, ramble on to no great effect for a few hundred pages. But let's cut to the chase: Dragons is a mess. So bad that I will not read another Martin word ever again. Not again. Never. Fool me once... You have been warned.

0385342063|4.0|This book is a fun depiction of a 21st century relationship in my eyes. Everything is done by phone, text, or e-mail. Sophie Kinsella writes women's fiction with a sense of humor! The characters are so much fun, and the day to day craziness in Poppy's life, and Sam's will make you laugh out loud. The only thing I found to be annoying were the footnotes! I told my self I would stop reading them after the first several pages, but somehow they drag your eyes to them! It felt, to me, like an unnecessary disruption in the story. But still an enjoyable book.<br />Would recommend to anyone who wants a story with a lot of laughs.
B003CHI3MU|5.0|At first I thought, a show about a meth dealer?  NOT FOR ME!  My 19 year old daughter forced us to watch one episode and we were hooked - spent our entire vacation at the beach watching all four seasons!  Season 5 is the series finale - can't wait - I just wish these cable shows would have a 20-22 season run and not 10-11 - way too short and too long a wait for the next season!  Come on HBO, SHO, AMC - you can play with the big boys - this is an award winning series and NOW I KNOW WHY!  Once you have met Walt, there is a little of him in most of us.
B003X5UFWW|1.0|This is a terrible movie with unbelievably bad writing.  For example: a man wins a bag of rice in a fight, he asks to fight three more men at once and loses, and is then shot dead by a Japanese occupation officer when he goes to take his rice.  The shooter is asked why he did it, and he says it was to teach him a lesson because the fighter lost but still took his rice.  What lesson does a dead man learn?!  The whole movie is full of non-sequiturs like this, deus-ex machina, and the story generally lacks reasoning and logic.  There is no character development or background given to support anything that happens.<br /><br />The kung-fu is merely passable, the presentation non-biographical and unhistorical, and the English dubbing is painfully unfitting.  Production values are otherwise good, but they're completely wasted on a nonsense script.<br /><br />There seems to be an astroturfing campaign to boost the ratings of Ip Man.  Buyer beware.
0399159029|5.0|In this eighth installment of the series on Bernie Gunther, Berlin detective, secret (and sometimes not so secret) hater of Nazis, and erstwhile \\"friend/enemy\\" of Reinhard Heydrich, Bernie finds himself ordered to Prague, where Heydrich has just been put in charge, and he wants Bernie to be his bodyguard.<br /><br /> There's also a woman whom Bernie rescues from an attack, and begins an affair with, and also the murder of a foreign worker to solve. Once Bernie gets to Prague (bringing the woman with him) he goes to Heydrich's villa and hobnobs with a slew of high Nazi officials. When one of Heydrich's adjutants is murdered, Bernie is given the unenviable task of finding the murderer, who must be among the high-ranking Nazi house guests. Interrogating that bunch is quite interesting, for Bernie has been given the right to say anything to them in his questioning, and that leads to some very astounding conversations, leading to some quite amazing bits of information.<br /><br /> Be assured that Bernie does, indeed, discover the identity, and that is where the plot gets even more interesting (or grotesque, depending upon your point of view). We know that Bernie survives this thicket of danger, for we've already read books in this series that recount his life years after the War. It doesn't matter. The author's excellent writing, historical knowledge (defenestration, anyone?) keep the pages turning. Read it and enjoy Philip Kerr once again at his best.

B000N3ST8O|5.0|i tell you what right now Amazon is the best. before this cd came in, i had bought a brand new fleetwood mac cd @ wal-mart. the very next day after i bought it, it started skipping. since i have received this cd it has never skipped and i play it constantly, believe me i love \\"STEVIE\\" she is the woman of all women, and if i'm not mistaken i believe this cd was only supposed to be 98% good condition, to me it was 200% perfect condition. i will never buy another cd or pc game from walmart again or dvd. thank you amazon. i believe everyone needs to go through you instead of walmart. i bought a pc game on the 24th from walmart it would not download the game correctly i returned it on the 26th, well with walmarts policy, i had to exchange it for the exact same game, i told myself b 4 i went up there that if that was my only option that i'd just have the same problem, so needless to say i brought it home and as i suspected the same problem occured. i'm not even going to worry about taking it back. they are not going to give me my money back, so walmart has just lost a lot of my business. i use a straight talk cell phone, that you can only get through walmart, but guess what as soon as i get some extra money i'm just gonna go back to net10 @ least i can buy their phones and minute cards pretty much anywhere. oh by the way amazon i love hidden object games, so if you ever want to send me any emails pertaining to hidden object games, feel free to do so. love ya, U R THE BEST.<br /><br />  karen f. carter

You can get past it with a Virtual Machine, or other workarounds, but I don't think it is worth it at that point.<br /><br />3.  HD screens, even 720p, lagg it out.  There may be no lag on a low res screen, but the higher resolution the screen the worse the lag is.  It is not reaally bad, but like any mouse lag in a FPS it can be detrimental to gameplay.<br /><br />4.  It is a lot of work.  It took me hours to get this thing working like anything close to a mouse.  It gets close but it still is not perfect.  When you think about it, the movements are still as if you are moving a giant analog stick.<br /><br />Conclusion:  Ok, it does work.  After a lot of fine tuning and adjusting it mostly works, however I ultimately returned mine because it was not worth the $50 I payed for it.  It takes a lot of time with little pay off.  Though it appears possible to get it accurate enough, every game you play with it is different, and will require a new set of tweaks and maps and adjustments.  I would only recommend this to someone who just can't stand a PS3 controller and has a lot of time to spend getting this thing perfect.
B005HSL626|2.0|this game has ben ripped off by other companys like changing it to a different vertion of fruit ninja or like the puss in boots vertion
B000PMG16U|5.0|Ok, so I was never a huge fan of these three movies. I bought the bluray because I said \\"Hey, it can only get better right?\\"  Generally speaking I was right.  There are a few things that were changes I wouldn't have, however there are more improvements than I can remember and they are much better than their originals(maybe with the exception of III)<br /><br />So here are some of the things I noticed.<br /><br />Episode I:  (The best IMO)<br />Jar-jar CGI is better.  Still not amazing, but better.<br /><br />Eye lids added to some of the aliens like the Nemoidian Viceroy and the rest of his species.<br /><br />Ships and vehicles have much better CGI including lighting, damage/grit and Engine effects.  First thing that blew me away was the beginning shot with the yellow engines glowing spectacularly on the \\"Ambassadors'\\" cruiser.<br /><br />Podrace looked better to me<br /><br />Every shot of a city or landscape seems to have been redone and they all look amazing.<br /><br />All effects, weapons and lighting have been enhanced and also look great.<br /><br />Yoda is now CGI.  Huge improvement on the awful puppet yoda.<br /><br />Episode II: (I didn't see as much here, but similar things were done.)<br />Small scenes added, effects and landscapes have all been enhanced or redone.<br /><br />Episode III: (the only  one with edits I didn't like)<br />There were a bunch of little CGI scenes added, specifically with starfighters involved. (See demise of Plo-Koon at order 66)<br /><br />Certain scenes were re-cut(for example, see the first scene in the begining with Anikin and Obi-wan talking while in starfighters).  Some of them were not well done and look kind of butchered, others are ok.<br /><br />Again, graphics and effects redone very well.<br /><br />All in all, improvements, and specifically Episode I has never looked better. I would recommend this to any star wars fan, even if they aren't fond of these movies.
B006W0QOF2|4.0|This movie begins as an interesting character study of Ryan Gosling's character, The Driver.  We are introduced to Gosling's character  - a mechanic who moonlights as a movie stunt driver and a robbery get-away-driver for hire -  as a nice guy with an even temper who seems content to allow other people to take advantage of him.  When he's on a driving job he is focused,  calm and his heart rate never seems to rise  even in the most dangerous of situations.  Half way through the movie events transpire - resulting from a superficial acquaintance  with a young woman and her child - which made me reevaluate the first impression I had of this character. I enjoyed this movie because it surprised me by taking off in directions I didn't expect.  Just when I thought I had figured out what was going to happen next something else happened that I didn't anticipate.  The  decision to go against type-casting and have Albert Brooks play the crime boss was brilliant.  You will see Albert Brooks as you have never seen him before.  I didn't give it five stars because I thought there were holes in the plot that needed further explanation.  The writers don't even attempt to provide any sort of back story for Gosling's character that would explain his actions and the choices he makes.  We are only told that he showed up at the garage where he works six years ago willing to work for less money than he should have been paid. This may have been intentional  - a \\"man with no name\\" device - but it didn't work and  left a hole in the movie that needed to be filled.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a fun and addicting game. Highly recommended for someone who wants some good short games. It also keeps you playing by achieving new games which is a plus.
B005UBNL0A|4.0|Placed this in a new M5A97 motherboard with 8G of ram.  Scored 7.2 (out of 7.9 possible) for the processor in the Windows Experience Index.  Overclocked to 4100 and scored 7.3.  I'm know I can overclock much more than that though but really dont need to.  Played Battlefield 3 with Radeon 6850 and get no stutters and ~50fps.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I really like this app when I have a wi-fi connection (I use on kindle fire and itouch).  but when there's no connection then most of the extra features like bible reading plans and note taking don't work and the number of bibles becomes limited to those that are dowloadable.  I can live with the message or NET but they aren't my top two.  the note taking and highlighting features are so-so.  I would give this 4.5 stars if it had more offline capability so I could take notes in class and better highlight verses capability.  itouch Paul Avery Bible app is another one I like and works better offline, but YouVersion has a few features that one doesn't.  both are free though, so cant really knock either!  don't buy a Bible app, just try this one and the other and pick the one you like.
0811875555|4.0|It really brings to life the ideas of how the film came to life. I enjoy to correlation to other Disney films. The pictures are beautiful, after flipping through the book you will want to watch the movie again.
0440243688|5.0|I was getting a little bored with Jack Reacher. I started at the beginning with the first book and here I was at Gone Tomorrow.  I was not expecting much except to be a little more bored with too many gun descriptions and military jargon.  BUT, I was pleasantly surprised!  This was an excellent book.  Loved it all.  Reacher almost made it a whole book without a woman!  lol  It was a great read.  enjoy!
0525478817|5.0|Other reviewers have given you the synopsis of this wonderful story so my addition has little to add. Luckily I read a magazine review which lead me to this book so I wasn't at all aware it is classified as a \\"Young Adult\\" read. What it actually is is a \\"Must Read\\" for everyone who has experienced cancer in their family, and everyone who hasn't. That being said, just buy the book. It's marvelous, enchanting and every other accolade a novel can achieve.
0060873027|1.0|An intriguing concept already explored, and in better fashion I'm sad to say, in \\"Fantastic Voyage\\", \\"Honey I Shrunk The Kids\\", etc. I love Crichten's stories, HOWEVER... this new attempt does not do Crichten justice.
B006T5G73Y|2.0|I had high hopes for this film, as I'm fascinated by the early days of the FBI and the conspiracy theories surrounding J. Edgar Hoover. Unfortunately, the film did not live up to my expectations. The story was very choppy, bouncing back and forth from Hoover's early years to just before his death. A senior Hoover is giving his memoirs, and talking about his glory days. I would have loved to get a deeper insight into Hoover's psyche and have had more depth into the forming of the FBI and his political ideals. Instead, we're only shown a Hoover who rants against the Bolsheviks (Communists), and his forming of the FBI seemed to be set on fast-forward. There were brief glimpses of the take down of several infamous mobsters, a lengthy investigation into the Lindbergh baby kidnapping, and too much time spent on Hoover's private life.<br /><br />It felt like the screen writer read through Hoover's Wikipedia entry and had to mention every single allegation about his private life. Which was pretty ridiculous since Hoover kept his private life private and certainly didn't discuss it in any memoir. I wouldn't have minded a brief look at his private life, but I wanted to see more of a concentration on his work as that was his priority in life. The social drama was very slow and drawn out. Though, the political drama was much too rushed and not explained well.<br /><br />The saving grace of the film was the acting. Leonardo DiCaprio did an amazing job as both young and old Hoover. He was pure perfection in the role. There were a slew of other famous faces in brief cameo appearances, each bringing their talent but never over-shadowing. Supporting actors Naomi Watts (as Hoover's secretary Helen Gandy),  Armie Hammer (as Hoover's prot&eacute;g&eacute; and close friend Clyde Tolson), and Judi Dench (as Hoover's mother) were all stunning in their performances as well.
B0062NAX1U|3.0|This was a very long movie. The messages were all fabulous but would have been more riveting if they could have taken this long movie to build more attachment to the characters instead of briefly introducing each family.  My fiance fell asleep in the middle of the movie, woke up before it ended and didn't really miss anything during his nap that would affect watching the rest of the movie.
0439023483|5.0|I don't really review products on amazon but I couldn't help but leave my feedback for The Hunger Games.  This book is one of the best books I've ever read, and it doesn't even have a swear word in it.  The suspense in the book never lets up and just when you think things are finally going to get better, something else bad happens.  Sure, I wanted to throw the book at times because I don't always agree with the characters (mostly Katniss when it comes to Peeta), but I still couldn't put the book down.  Almost every chapter ends with a cliffhanger and you can't help but read on.  I could literally read the book again and I just finished it.  I almost cried a couple of times as well; it can be that emotional.  I am just mesmerized by the writing abilities of Suzanne Collins.  The Hunger Games is easily my new favorite book.  If you want to read a book that will take you on a ride you'll never forget, then I highly recommend The Hunger Games.  This book will blow you away.
B006ON41FC|3.0|This game is very addicting but unfortunately it lags. at least on the samsung vibrant.  it freezes and sometimes gets locked up while moving therefore crashing into a tree.  if there was a option to lower graphics it would be a GREAT game.
0062082353|1.0|This book is for children, and that only in case you don't want them to learn the language.<br />Conceptually: Absolute goodness vs. absolute evil.<br />Awfully written.Incredible that it was/is a best-seller.<br />Don't wate your time, even if you have lots of it.<br />I gave it one star only because there is no ZERO star option.
6305736650|5.0|Classic movie. I gave this as a gift to someone who had NEVER seen the movie --- perish the thought. Arrived in perfect condition - on time.
B0068MNO4S|1.0|1.  Ok, I know that there are experts out there who can comment on the bogus nature of this film etc...<br />2.  However, at the most elementary level this film is just plain terrible entertainment;  it's poorly written, disjointed and lacking in any depth.  ie a complete dud on all accounts.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Love this game and works great on my Toshiba Thrive tablet!  Easy controls and good graphics.  Retro style brings me back to the 80's but looks better!

B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is actually really fun and interesting. the fact that you have to unlock games makes you want to play more to see what other games there are. the games are really fun and addicting. they are all different and you have to do different things in each one so it never gets boring.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Boy have I been in the dark on this triology.  Just heard of the Hunger Games two weeks ago.  Went home bought the triology on my kindle and read it in less than two weeks.  Could not put it down.  Had to see what happen next and now that I finished it can't stop talking about it.  Really recommend it to anyone no matter what you normally read you will love this trilogy.  Hope the movie does the book justice because can't wait to see it.

B0063IH60K|4.0|I like solitaire when I'm watching Tv. This version is simple and easy to use. The graphics are pretty and it responds well.
B002VPEAM6|4.0|I think the author must have lots of fun writing all the civil servant pieces. It is not easy to invent such passages. As to the book itself, the ending is sad, but it is difficult to see how else the story could have been brought to an end after so much devotion to a cause by the patriarch. The suggestion that faith<br />and determination can be fulfilled is certainly one that needs supporting just now.  Abd the idea of fish migrating successfully from Scotland to Yemen is<br />most appropriate, if rather unlikely.  The depiction of Scotland is quite remarkable without launching into travelese, and the departure of the wife for<br />a far-distant job only too appropriate in these days of mobile travel.  I enjoyed the book thoroughly and look for other of Mr. Torday's works.  John Kay<br /><br />Amazon Verified Purchase
B0063IH60K|5.0|it is solitaire, come on who could mess it. I don't think it matters really what the cards look like. it is solitaire and that is it.
B000065V42|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie as a kid and now my kid enjoys it. It's a great family movie with no vulgarity or any kind of crude humor, really. Not like today's kid/family movies. It's very fun to watch and kind of takes you on an adventure in a way. If you've never seen it, buy it. You won't be disappointed.
B007B8GI28|4.0|The episode \\"trigger-finger\\" is just the quick-fix were all waiting for but, is it matching up to the relentless high standards of the book counter-part? Maybe so. Maybe not, yet. I just hope the TV series makes it to season 6 at this rate and by season 3 with the characters and back-story out of the way we might get a show worth watching. Trigger-finger is a suspenseful short turning point, the pace it went was far quicker than that of previous episodes, with it focused more toward action than drama. It even answers far less questions and leaves even more. So there is that. I give it 4/5 stars, if it slowed up a small notch, packed in with a bit more content It'd be a 5/5.<br /><br />What I think of the Tv series The Walking Dead is it needs still this; (if your a Walking Dead cast-member you should read it, maybe you agree)<br /><br />-Survival Mindset: Less worried about where you are, more about whats currently happening. That usually equals superb suspense, engaging conflicts, & a sense of reality.<br /><br />-Characters: Should have redeeming qualities like being engaging, thrilling, tactful, practical, ect. or even witty in the \\"heat of the moment\\". Basically, they work best under pressure. This is something they may not be even aware of yet or ever.<br /><br />-Writing, can't stress this enough, they need to have a better written script in-order to immerse to the audience, with a sense of surreal awareness with the cast & characters. Write it to fit the theme(zombies/survival/mystery, yes in that order mostly), then the setting(place/area/world), then most importantly the character or characters interactions in that setting (events & interactions). Also editing shouldn't ever kill a good plot-line just to save \\"face\\".<br /><br />If they can nail these three things it will indeed catch my continued interest. I highly recommend watching the series & the especially the turning point episode: \\"Trigger-finger\\" If you have been watching up to this point. I'm a survivalist fan, the type that likes extremes like zombies, apocalypse, mystery, post-apocalypse, the doomsdays stuff within practicality (or scientific reason rather) or sci-fi occasionally. So its worth the buy, just wait for the DVD set though or get it here from Amazon digitally now.vivalist fan, the type that likes extremes like zombies, apocalypse, mystery, post-apocalypse, the doomsdays stuff within practicality (or scientific reason rather) or sci-fi occasionally.

B004SIP6BI|4.0|Item was in good con dition, de livery was timely, and the pack aging was adequate, an overall good ex perience.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. The whole cast does a wonderful job, from James Franco playing a doctor searching for a cure for Alzheimer's to the amazingly brilliant Andy Serkis as Caesar. At times you even find yourself cheering for the apes. Much better than the remake with Mark Wahlberg.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|Beth & Joe together are absolutely amazing! Beth puts every bit of her soul into her singing on this CD. Joe & the band complement Beth perfectly. They are meant to play together & I certainly hope that they do again!<br /><br />I've never written a review for a CD before, although I have certainly bought & listened to many over my long life (55+), but this is the first that I just cannot get enough of. I want more music like this CD!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Words cannot express how much I love this movie. It makes you focus on the tough realities of life in the South as recently as 50 years ago. The Help builds a world that is almost unbelievable in today's society. Despite these eye-opening issues, this movie is definitely a \\"feel good\\" one. I laughed and I cried, but when the movie was over I felt proud and inspired.

B004JZBGWI|5.0|I got a kindle fire for Christmas I always wished it had notepad then I found this app. love this app.
0439023491|4.0|There are two big flaws in this story.<br /><br />1) The characters have absolutely no sex drive despite the fact that they are teenagers sharing the same bed.  Apparently, graphic violence is fine for a young reader but the slightest sexual desire is not.<br /><br />2)  Choosing a romantic partner is harder for Katniss than deciding to kill a fellow schoolmate who once fed her when she was on the brink of death from starvation.  Katniss is such a strong, fierce warrior.  Yet, in this book she whines and swoons and wallows in self pity from cover to cover.<br /><br />There are some other things, but those two flaws are the ones that make this book less than what it could be.  After Hunger Games I rushed to buy the next two novels because I simply couldn't stop reading.  Now the third is sitting on my shelf, but I will take a little break before I pick it up.
0738727326|5.0|I had seen art from this deck before and I knew I had to have it. I'm pretty new to the tarot and still learning, and this was my third deck. The images are beautiful and unbelievably detailed. The symbolism is great, and the images are fairly close to the standard Rider-Waite so it's good as a beginner deck. This is only the deck, keep in mind, and there is a separate book, but this deck includes a small packet with brief explanations of all the cards as well as a few simple spreads. I am very happy that I bought this deck and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a beautiful deck.
B003UESJF6|5.0|I´ve seen it with my kids and we laughed from the very beginning until the very end. Spanish is our mother tongue and we live in Argentina, but we have seen it in English with no subtitles: even better. We've seen it three times in a rainy weekend. Haven't got tired and discovered different things. Entertainment guaranteed and I recommend it for anti hero picture lovers.

B005UKJX4E|1.0|I've got a high tolerance for slow movies. I can usually appreciate a movie that others think was bad or slow or whatever.<br /><br />This movie on the other hand was so far out in left field it was basically 2 hours of total nonsense. I can't imagine how any normal human being could possibly say they enjoy this movie unless they are only trying to look smart.<br /><br />Immediately after the film, if you can call it that, someone told me she was going to start a support group for people who saw this movie. Another person said it was 2 hours of his life he'll never get back. This was in a theatre that shows these types of \\"artsy\\" movies exclusively.<br /><br />I'd call it pretentious, but that doesn't even describe it.<br /><br />If you want to completely waste 2 hours of your life, by all means watch this movie. It's worse than watching paint dry.
0780020685|5.0|This 1954 movie is Akira Kurosawa's all time classic. Starring Toshiro Mifune in his youth, this movie inspired the western \\"The Magnificent Seven\\". Rated 14th best film of all time on the internet movie database (as of this writing), this film is a must-see.  It is fairly long at 207minutes so a good film for a week-end night.<br /><br />The first hour is spent telling the story of a village trying to recruit samurai to defend it from bandits. This is the most fun, lighthearted part of the film. The rest of the film has quite a bit of action but is not too violent for children in my opinion. The film deals with serious issues and is very entertaining; I have no idea if the portrayal of medieval Japan is accurate or not.  For my part, I strongly recommend this movie.

0439023521|5.0|I really enjoyed this series.  The books are incredibly fast reads (probably because they are geared toward young adults).  I think I read all three in four days.  The characters are well developed and the plot will capture you.  It is set in a future society that is divided into districts and run by \\"The Capital,\\" which holds complete control of the 12 districts.  Once a year, the Capital holds the Hunger Games, a reality TV show where children are randomly chosen from each district to compete to the death.  With its many twists and turns, including a love story thrown in the mix, The Hunger Games will keep you wanting more.  I highly recommend this book.

B002BWP49C|1.0|The TWILIGHT series is definitely a guilty pleasure -- at least, the first three books are, and the first three movies are at least fun, in a \\"this is really stupid on screen\\" way.  I only WISH this had been so bad it was funny; I can always use a good laugh.  But the movie BREAKING DAWN commits the worst sin there is for a movie:  it's BORING.  The wedding takes half an hour, the honeymoon seemed to take forever (and not in a good way), and the rest of it -- well, aside from counting the number of times the werewolves' ears flopped over (they do, really), it was so dull I kept falling asleep.  Maybe I can save it and the forthcoming Part 2 for those nights when Sominex just doesn't do it.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I purchased this film collection as a gift for my 24 year old son.  He has been a Potter fan since the beginning.  To have all of the films in one complete set is wonderful.  He was thrilled to receive it and will get many hours of enjoyment from it for years to come.
B0053JJLLC|2.0|I also bought this in book format. I had no choice, needed something to read in the airport/airplane and forgot to pack my Kindle. Could have stared at the seat in front of me but thought not. I have always been satisfied with Crichton so I thought I made a good decision. Well, this is not classic Crichton; and should not be confused with classic/vintage Crichton. I could not get into it and chose to sleep.

B004I8WD6E|5.0|After going through numerous cases for my white iPhone 4s, I've finally found one I like.  It looks great and allows you to see the design elements of the phone, while offering protection.  The case is low profile, which is a huge plus for me, and has some grip to it.  Most of the clear cases are hard and slick, but this one if flexible and does not feel like it will fall out of your hand.
0688014291|5.0|This has and always will be one of my most favorite books ever. It was required reading for all my sales reps when I was in sales management - AND, they were each required to answer a question sheet afterwards as well, lol. It is a small, simple read and thoroughly explains the best possible way to maintain a great and professional relationship between ANY manager and ANY employee. It is a MUST READ for anybody in the work force, expecially managers of any type!

B0059XTUB8|5.0|\\"My Week with Marilyn\\" is a biographical film that focuses on Marilyn Monroe starring in the movie \\"The Prince and the Showgirl,\\" which was shot in England.<br /><br />The story is based on two books by British filmmaker Colin Clark (played by Eddie Redmayne) who had personal interaction with Monroe, and much of the film's narrative is from the point of view of Clark, who is warm and likeable.<br /><br />Michelle Williams is exceptional as Monroe, and she presents with shining glamour and captures the vulnerability of Monroe's personality with poignant authenticity.<br /><br />It is a credit to director Simon Curtis that he chose to make a film about Monroe, which focuses on an extract of her life and career, yet he was able to capture so many facets of the Monroe brand and persona without attempting to make a movie of her whole life. This is too often an overambitious target of filmmakers to pack a life into one film, but the selection of a set period of time was a masterstroke by Curtis, which allowed for deeper immersion of Monroe over a short period of time.<br /><br />The viewer is easily enchanted by the beauty and complexity of Monroe, and Clark is a faithful friend and servant to her, who gets to see the person behind the star.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W.

B004XWMXX8|4.0|Selena Gomez & The Scene released their sophomore studio album 'A Year Without Rain' in September 2010, 1 year after their debut album 'Kiss & Tell' since Selena had discovered the sound she liked. Having no rush to release another album and while promoting 'A Year Without Rain', Selena listened to a song composed by Emanuel Kiriakou and Priscilla Hamilton called 'Who Says' and she thought it was really inspirational and she had to have it. After having the track, she decided to begin a new release after she really loved 'Who Says' and thought her fans needed to hear it. In late 2010, Selena and her band were back in the studio again to record their third studio album. In February 2011, it was revealed to the public that the band was working on a new album and a new single was coming out soon. Selena revealed the song's name that same month and released it the following month. 'Who Says' received positive reviews and the critics and fans thought it was a great song with a more organic and acoustic feel and appreciated its inspiring message about self-empowerment. The band released their third album called 'When The Sun Goes Down' in June 2011 and I'll review the songs and give my conclusion at the end:<br /><br />1. Love You Like A Love Song - The album's first track and second single. Like the title says, this is a love song but at the same time it's also good to dance. I like this song, but for me there were much better choices for the second single and I got bored of this song fast, it's too overrated by the fans who seem to love it way too much. I give it an 8/10<br /><br />2. Bang Bang Bang - The album's second track. Just like the first track, I liked it at first but soon got bored of it and also think it's overrated, the only difference is that this song is slightly worse than the first one. The main problem is that the beats and the production is weak. This song was released as a promotional single. I give it a 7.5/10<br /><br />3. Who Says - The album's third track and first single. I already talked about this one, this song inspired Selena to make a new record since the fans had to listen to it. I should say this when I give my conclusion but this song played an important role in this topic so I'll say it now: Selena shouldn't have released a third album so fast, a re-release could have been much better than a whole new record if she wanted to let her fans hear it. This is not the same as a re-release of 'Kiss & Tell', it wouldn't have worked with that album since Selena needed a whole new album to show the sound that identified her, a re-release wasn't appropiate since 'Kiss & Tell' was mostly experimental and had a lot of different sounds in it. A re-release of 'A Year Without Rain' could have worked, she could add this song a few more included on this album since it's the same sound. Whatever, she already released a new album so I can't complain, this song is very inspiring and I fell in love with it when I first heard it, but after almost 1 year it doesn't sound too fresh, but I still won't deny its message is awesome and this song proves how Selena loves her fans and makes her music for them. I give it a 9.5/10<br /><br />4. We Own The Night - The album's fourth track. Personally, I expected more from this song, I expected it to be a fun song to dance and in fact I thought it would be the same version recorded by Jessie And The Toy Boys, so I was surprised to see it was a different composition. I think this song is pretty dull and the message isn't appropiate for her young fans (it talks about spending the night with a boy!). I give it a 6.5/10<br /><br />5. Hit The Lights - The album's fifth track and third and final single. Finally some good dance songs like I heard them on 'A Year Without Rain', this song will for sure make you dance and was a perfect choice for the third single. I give it a 9.5/10<br /><br />6. Whiplash - The album's sixth track. Now this is an AMAZING NEXT LEVEL track! And of course, no oneelse than Britney Spears and her writers team could have made this awesome dance song, this was recorded by Britney for her album 'Circus' but failed to appear on the tracklisting so it was later given to Selena who loved it. This song is so amazing and my favorite on the abum. I give it a 10/10<br /><br />7. When The Sun Goes Down - The album's seventh track. This song is great and the best thing about it is that it was co-written by Selena and Joey Clement, one of the band's members. This song talks about waiting impatiently for the night to come so the party can start. I give it a 9.5/10<br /><br />8. My Dilemma - The album's eighth track. This song didn't work very well with me, it talks about a dilemma with a love which was a theme that was also present on 'A Year Without Rain', but the real dilemma here is its instrumental... it's SO cheesy and corny, I wish Rock Mafia could have made a better work since the lyrics are great but the production is bad. I give it a 7/10<br /><br />9. That's More Like It - The album's ninth track. This song was co-penned by Katy Perry again and given to Selena, the same happened with 'Rock God' which was included on 'A Year Without Rain'. According to Selena, it's about female empowerment but I just don't see that, the lyrics are very corny in my opinion and the song is pretty bad. I give it a 6.5/10<br /><br />10. Outlaw - The album's tenth track. This song was also co-written by Selena and talks about a love runaway. It's a great song, but it sometimes get boring and you wish it ended. I give it a 8.5/10<br /><br />11. Middle Of Nowhere - The album's eleventh track. This song is so beautiful, Selena really showcases her vocals here and sounds like a diva singing it, so I really appreciated that. This song ties with 'Whiplash' as my favorite on the album. I give it a 10/10<br /><br />12. Dices (Who Says - Spanish Version) - The album's twelfth and final track on the standard edition. This is the Spanish version of 'Who Says' but since Spanish is my native language, I understood the lyrics and this time the message really changes, now Selena sings about herself instead of other people like her fans and that's not good. I don't blame Selena, I blame the guys who translated the song (Edgar Cortazar and Mark Portmann), why after the Spanish version of 'A Year Without Rain' turned out very neat you had to make such a bad translation that changed this song's message! Now it's just about Selena, not her fans and listeners and you're to blame. Selena's Spanish is still impressive, but I was so disappointed with the terrible translation that I will have to give it separate ratings. Translation: 0/10, Selena's Intention: 10/10, Selena's Spanish: 9.5/10, Original rating for English version: 9/10<br /><br />This album wasn't as good as 'A Year Without Rain', while Selena's vocals have improved and her voice is not too autotuned, the album's production was pretty bad and seems like some producers saved their worst for Selena which is very bad (although Britney saved one of her best works ever and gave it to Selena). The lyrics weren't that bad (the best lyrics obviously being the ones from 'Who Says') but the production was a real problem here and that's why I rate this album a 4/5 on Amazon. I still recommend this album to any Selena fan and even casual listeners who might like the songs I didn't. Like I said in the review for the song 'Who Says', a re-release could have worked better and should have included 'Whiplash', 'Middle Of Nowhere' and 'Who Says'. Anyways, congratulations Selena, but next time work with better producers or tell your current producers to stop fooling you and giving you their worst songs.

0099519852|5.0|Anyone who is interested in learning, acquiring or teaching any skill should read this book. This may become one of the most influential books on learning and acquiring skill ever written. Every educator should be required to read this book and every person who is learning anything can gain valuable insight by reading it. I have already read it twice and plan on reading it again many times more!
0385535139|3.0|A very entertaining and readable book. Although this is the only one of Grisham's books I've read, I'm sure that it's not his best work. The problem is, it just doesn't have any depth to it. The characters are well drawn and even interesting, for the most part. The plot is good (although it could easily have been better). The resolution is adequate, if forced (again - it could have been more satisfactory). In short, it's a fine read if you just want to get lost in an interesting situation for a few hours. Grisham raises a number of points in the book that could have been developed far more, some relating to the practice of law, some relating to business ethics, and some relating to what different people consider most important in life. But he basically sticks to the formula he has honed over the years and pretty much has down to a science now. And it works, and it will continue to give him best-sellers, and occasionally a movie deal. It would be cool, though, if he could do for the Civil Litigator genre what Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler did for the Private Investigator genre. I know that's a tall order - but I get the feeling he is capable of it. This book, for example, could have developed the David Zinc character a lot more. After the initial couple of chapters, he has Zinc pretty much on auto-pilot, and then develops Wally Figg. Why does a Harvard trained attorney with a great job suddenly veer off the road to riches and take up with a couple of mutts? That's a fascinating question, and it's not really explored all that much in this book. Just saying he got to a crisis point and one day just melted down isn't nearly enough. Of course, that might require abandoning the formula somewhat, but it might produce a much better book. Anyway, this was enjoyable enough as-is, although I'm not sure it was enough to entice me to read more Grisham.
055358894X|5.0|I purchased the audio book version, because now I rarely have time to sit down and read... and I found myself sitting in the car to get just 'one more page'. I love this book! I've heard it described as Ocean's Eleven meets Venice, and I feel like that's a good start. It's really a fun ride, you're always guessing what comes next, and just when you think things can't get more complicated they get a LOT more complicated. Thunderous ending that wraps everything up, but is a good prelude to the next, and I already have that one in my audiobook lineup.<br /><br />I want to address one thing - some people seem to think that the writing is too 'made for Hollywood', but I really disagree here. Sure, it's really entertaining but I do think there is some character depth here, although it isn't evenly dispersed with every character. I think that the author balances the plot threads so well that you just don't notice how crazy it's all getting, and I feel like the world is well defined and rich without belaboring the point.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the game is pretty good my son and I have been playing it and is great that we have a game that we can play together that we both enjoy.  I hope is twenty words.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I read this book because of the strong recommendation of my daughter and my son, both of raved about \\"Hunger Games,\\" despite their being too old for young-adult fiction.  A combination of Shirley Jackson's \\"The Lottery\\", \\"1984\\", \\"Lord of the Flies\\", and the CBS television show \\"Survivor\\"--with some Harry Potter-like creatures thrown in for good measure--\\"Hunger Games\\" is the story of a futuristic dystopia in which two dozen young teens are selected by a lottery each year to fight one another to death over a period of several weeks on a nationally broadcast television show.  It's not great literature, but it is a surprisingly gripping read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game it keeps me occupied at work when I have nothing to do. it makes time go by fast and I just like it very much.

B0011Z5CV0|4.0|I bought this for my 6 month old twins (Boy & Girl) They mainly chew on it. It keeps them entertained for a few minutes. It is more entertaining if an adults uses it to interact with the baby.<br /><br />The quality is great. It will last a long time.

0385738765|5.0|This is the 2nd book of the Maze Runner trilogy and it's just as awesome as the first. Really enjoyed this book. The chapters were always ending in cliff hangers. Made it hard to put down.<br />This story picks up right at the end of the 1st book. As soon as the Gladers get comfy and think everything is alright, chaos hits and they find themselves sent on another \\"mission\\". We meet a couple more characters in this book. Also start to wonder who is trustworthy and who is not. Many more questions pop up and a few start to get answered. Still keeps you wondering if WICKED really is good and what role everyone has to play in their scheme. If you liked the first one, I highly recommend this one as well!
0817439390|5.0|This is the first photography book I have ever owned and it was the perfect choice. The book is easy to understand even as hobbyist photographer just starting out. Don't think for a minute that this book is just for a beginner almost anyone can get something from it.  Another nice thing about it is that it includes online videos that you can have access to if you purchase the book further explaining parts in the book. I highly recommend it, Bryan Peterson is an excellent instructor that makes it fun to understand photography. The pages and photo's in the book are high resolution that makes it an even more attractive read.
B004Z4LVZK|5.0|This is the first book of a trilogy and have to say it was amazing! Had this one sitting on my shelf for a while. Thought that it might be too much like Hunger Games so I kept putting it off. I was wrong on that end.<br />It's about a boy named Thomas who wakes to find himself in a moving closed-in container with hardly no memory at all. Scared and confused, the \\"box\\" he is in finally stops and he winds up in a place with other teenage boys. These boys run this place by raising animals, gardening, etc. They've learned to take care of themselves with what they have and what they may receive through the box. Around their \\"home\\" is a maze where some of them go daily in search of a way out.<br />Thomas's arrival wasn't unusual but the arrival after him is. That arrival sends the whole place out of balance and nothing is the same afterwards. Who put them there and why?<br />Fast paced throughout the book. Had to keep reading the next chapter because I had to find out what happened next. Highly recommended!
B005UKJX4E|1.0|Yes, the movie has dinosaurs.  I cannot tell you why as I've been unable to really figure it out.  I watched this movie knowing that it was very polarizing and I would either love it or hate it.  I tried to love it - I did.  I even started to believe I \\"got it\\".  And then came the dinosaurs. You can try to say that this movie is existential and brilliant.  I'm just going to go with the explanation that they were playing a joke on the viewing audience.  It has to be a joke.
1933865407|5.0|I've been waiting for this book for a long time. Bruce Timm is a master of cartoon art and has learned his craft by studying from the best in the business. I see influences by Frazetta, Wood, DeCarlo and many others. This book is without a doubt well worth the price on it. I'm a freelance illustrator and I buy a lot of art books. This is up there with the best of them. If you love cartoon art you will not be disappointed in this one. And if you do like this kind of art you may want to look at some of mine. You can find it at [...] and my personal web site at [...] It seems that Amazon wont allow me to use my web address so if your interested just look me up on google.

B005MYEPXC|5.0|Woody Allen at his near best as the Oscars attested to. Owen Wilson is his hapless self, the action is creatively fun and beautiful to look at. Good story.
B004ZISVWC|5.0|I watched this movie on a lark, telling myself this had to be a mistake (seeing as it was touting 4.7 stars!)  I should have started from the beginning, but I cheated and skipped the first 20 minutes so I could see what the actions scenes were like.  It felt like a true documentary, and for the first few minutes I thought it was (you know, crazy guy thinks trolls really exist and is being debunked), but then a the first troll gets filmed and all bets were off : )  I should have gone back to the beginning, but got pulled in and just kept watching from where I was.<br /><br />The animation was flawless, and the feeling of true documentary was never lost.  The plot (as simple as it sounds) was nicely rick with personalities and cultural history woven in together with the characters and situations.  I grew up on stories of Jotunheim and the All Father, so this was a real (hate to use the word) treat for me and I'll keep my eyes open for the whatever the makers come out with next.

B004LROUNG|3.0|I religiously read Grisham books shortly after they come out and love almost all of them, but this one isn't one of my favorites. The characters were built with a lot of depth and thought, but two of the main characters (Finley and Figg) were frustratingly difficult to like. I know this is how Grisham meant the characters to be, but having so much of the book written around them made me not excited to continue reading. The character Zinc was deep, compassionate, and likable. This added to the story and helped me trudge through the blandness of parts of the book. I wasn't compelled to read this book in a day or two like most Grisham books. It took me about a week because it was more like a chore than something entertaining for me. I didn't find there to be a great climax of the book, but was satisfied with the ending. Miss Grisham books that are a little more fast paced and exciting (The Client, The Pelican Brief, The Firm, ect.).

Well organized content, easy to read, descent scientific backing. Great book! My only request would be for a minimalist version of the book itself that cut out the story and just gave the facts and how to's in bullet points. Thanks :)
B005C9YZKU|4.0|I believe that David Attenbourough was born into this world as an old man. He has the most perfect old-man informative voice in the world, and while I listen to him narrate Planet Earth I feel as if a little girl again, sitting on my grandfather's lap and loving every second of his story.<br /><br />Getting this in blu-ray was possibly one of the best decisions of my life. If you are wondering as to the differences between DVD and blu-ray, blu-ray is about 100000000x more awesome. If you have a tv that can accommodate 1080p, I must warn you that you may want to play this show on loop for the rest of your life. Every animal, every petal, every leaf is as if it is right in front of you. This show is beautiful, and there is not another like it. I bought this for my boyfriend as a present for Valentines day and he loves it.<br /><br />GIFT WRAPPING BUYERS BEWARE: Amazon gift wrap this in a beautiful bag.... but contained in the bag was the ugly cardboard box that actually contained the Planet Earth item. Why would you ever pay 5 dollars extra for someone to place your cardboard package in a bag, in a package? Ridiculous. I would have otherwise given it 5 stars.
B004E0Z4XK|3.0|Lovely little excursion. When I heard the first song, a feeling came over me that this will become my new favorite album. Alas, future tracks are weaker, and although danger mouse strikes a few right notes, many are off. Luppi's songs are OK, but sound generic and her vocals are somehow unfitting on a project like this. Rather than religiously playing this CD over and over (apart from the first track), I'll play this when company comes. I'll say Rome, they'll say \\"Interesting\\" that's that.

B0071NLG0W|5.0|This is the best Amber Fox book yet! It has all the components that you'd expect from a rom-com. It's funny with a dash of romance and a quirky mystery for our beloved Fox to solve. The story line is brilliant and keeps the reader flipping fast through the pages. I can't wait to see what the next book is about!

0553801473|3.0|So much has been written in reviews that I won't belabor much of what has already been said.  I have read all 5 books on Kindle in the past 6 months, so I am new to the series.  I had been interested in reading them, but reviews were mixed and given the length of the books, I was not sure I wanted to jump in.  I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Book 5 is far reaching and introduces a number of new characters.  Thankfully, Martin gives us a list of them that is pages and pages long, and an ever expanding map so we can visualize where the action is happening.<br /><br />Martin, in this series, has essentially created a new and complex world full in intriguing characters.  Unfortunately, it seems that, as with these characters, he has gotten lost and just muddles through their world.  The time spent Meereen is particularly tedious.  I was introduced to characters I really wasn't interested in, doing things I didn't care about.<br /><br />As many previous reviewers have said, Martin needs a good editor.  REALLY!  The story, characters, action and descriptions need to be tightened up.  I really read the second half of the book because I wanted to get to the end and found myself skimming and skipping over many paragraphs.<br /><br />Unlike other books in the series, I really didn't mind waiting to go on to the next chapter.  I think that is because the worlds of the North and East or so very different and only vaguely connected to what had became the core location of the book, Westeros.  Sure some of our favorite characters helped to bridge that gap.  But mostly my attention was forcefully and unwillingly jerked from one place to the other.  Someone in another review mentioned that Martin displayed attention deficit disorder in this book, and I agree.<br /><br />Thankfully the book picks up again toward the end with plenty of surprises, cliffhangers and loose ends that beg to be tied up.<br /><br />What I liked:  The development of Cercie and a deeper understanding of her personality.  Tyrion, always.  Although his story did get a little bogged down in Meereen.  The introduction of Penny who begins to help Tyrion develop a different side to himself.  Also the introduction of another new character who may have an important role in the outcome of the book.  More on Bran and his search for his powers.  Theon's character arc.  The ever present, coniving Varys.  Dany finally getting to ride her dragon.<br /><br />Also Martin has done a good job, for a man, in writing compelling female characters.  Since the time period is similar to the Middle Ages in our time, even highborn, strong women had a difficult time.  Men ruled their world and would use physical force to control them.  It's no wonder they had to manipulate to survive.<br /><br />If you like this series, you might also like Sharon Kay Penman's historical fiction set the real life power struggles in England and France during our own middle ages.  The books are much better written, with strong character development, great story arcs, and tighter editing.  And, truly, the truth (human history) is often better than fiction.  The first book in that series is \\"When Christ and the Saints Slept\\".<br /><br />All that said, I liked this book enough to look forward to the next one.  I only hope that I and GRRM live long enough to see that day.lity.  Tyrion, always.  Although his story did get a little bogged down in Meereen.

B006QKKMBA|4.0|This is actually a smarter film than it pretends to be.  It's so smart that it pretends to be dumb at times, but then there's a GOTCHA, like when you think, oh, it's gonna be the ceiling fan.  No, it's gonna be the water dripping onto the frayed electric cable; she'll land in the water and get electrocuted.  No, she'll do one more twirl on the bar, then it come loose, flip sideways, and she'll impale herself on it.  Wrong.  And that's why it's funny.  They sucker you in, then surprise you.  Every time.

The only reason I gave it 4* instead of 5* is because I've bought 2 upgrades in the store and they don't work. the store says that he is equipped, but he's clearly not (ie., helmet for the owls, but the owls kill him). That's frustrating when my current goal requires a helmet to crash through owls. Other than that problem (please fix it!), I love this game. It's kept me up way later than I should be many nights.

Anyway, it is an animation film from the director of the action-packed Indiana Jones franchise, and there is no question as to its entertainment value. This is a fun roller roaster ride, with plenty of action set-pieces.<br /><br />Jamie Bell plays Tintin, and Andy Serkis, Captain Haddock. But what you see is not them, but the characters processed by motion capture (or performance capture) technology. Eight years have passed since the release of \\"The Polar Express\\" (in which Tom Hanks' character looked like a walking dead body), and the unnatural feeling that was often prominent is motion capture films back then is gone ... well, almost.<br /><br />I for one enjoyed the new film, but I suspect this is partly because I did not expect much from the film adaptation from the beginning. We all know the original creator Hergé and his highly stylized artwork that evokes our imagination. \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\" is creation of Spielberg's imagination (and perhaps that of co-prodcer Peter Jackson), and the film is entertaining as such.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Was working (mostly) until the update. Now all my progress keeps getting erased. Incomplete game with no support = bad business!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|the settings are amazing, u can set it so u have to shake the device or solve math problems to snooze, u can make it get louder, auto dismiss, and soooooooo many more I would TOTALLY recommend this app I cant even believe its free!!!!!!!!!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game is another version of a classic concept.  You can take or leave the story element, but the user interface is good.
0307593495|2.0|I've read ( or listened to) all of the Wollander books. Great stuff. But this installment of Wollander saga is by far the weakest and most meandering. Perhaps the author realized it himself and this was the reason he so decisively and  pointedly finished off Wollander at the end of the book. Lest the fans or the publisher should demand another installment.
B00005JM02|1.0|I was looking forward to watching this great movie with my daughter, but the DVD was damaged. We could only see parts of it.
B0010X745K|4.0|The army's \\"Arrowhead Project\\" has poked a hole into another dimension and it may be open for good.  A massive and violent thunderstorm pounds a small town in Maine and does tremendous damage.  David Drayton (Thomas Jane) takes his young son and his neighbor into town to get supplies and to see what is going on as the power is out.  While at the grocery/hardware store an all obscuring mist rolls in and takes visibility to zero.  The store is full of customers and a man runs in screaming that there is something in the mist.  A man who goes outside is heard screaming and the customers close the doors of the store and prepare for the worst.<br /><br />The customers separate into 3 main groups, those who want to leave, those who want to stay inside and a group forms around a fanatic telling everyone it is the end of days.  The store's generator shuts down and a clerk goes out to fix it and he is killed by a monster that attacks.  A few try to leave but they either disappear into the mist or are heard screaming as they die....<br /><br />Stephen King's imagination runs wild in this story and the result is a very good storyline full of terrifying creatures let loose into this world.  I am a Stephen King fan and own just about everything the man has written and I loved this story.<br /><br />Unfortunately the director and screen writers take liberties with the storyline and change the ending to create some closure that the novella didn't do.  I feel that the ending of the movie is just too sad and for me I did not enjoy the movie as well as I enjoyed the book.  It is still worth watching but just be aware that if you read the book that the movie is different.<br /><br />This movie features great special effects and they are right out of Stephen King's imagination.  That part of the movie follows the book pretty well and I enjoyed it.  The acting is very good and I even wanted to shoot Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden) who is the main leader of the fanatic group.<br /><br />Watch this movie; you will like it if you like Stephen King!Watch this movie; you will like it if you like Stephen King!
B006MW3VGA|5.0|British TV is so wonderful to watch.  This series has become one of my favorites.  I can't wait until season 3 starts.  It is definitely worth watching.  The characters are being developed so wonderfully.  The writing is excellent.  It was well worth the money.
B004ZIHYXO|5.0|This CD is Awesome. Most CD's have at least two songs that are great and the rest not so much, but this whole CD is awesome. Amazon is great. They have fast service and great products.
B0070Z97LG|5.0|Hadn't heard much about the movie but the premise sounded great so I thought I would give it a whirl. Actually watched it on my Kindle Fire with some new Klipsch Earphones and I really enjoyed it. Got so engrossed in the movie that I felt like I was watching it in a theater. Really love audio with the headphones. Makes the experience much richer, especially with a suspense filled thriller like Dream House. Great movie... really keeps you guessing. Highly recommend it
B005M2A4D4|5.0|I'll be honest that when Matt Smith started being the Doctor last season, I couldn't forgive him for replacing David Tennant... but I should have known that wouldn't last for long after the transition between Christopher Eccleston and David. I just can't help it! The producers pretty consistently pick the right man. And Matt's just getting better with time. The storylines are very detailed and Mr. Moffatt just loves to throw in series long arcs. It's engrossing and fun! Please continue!!!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game never gets old. I have it on my phone, on my Nintendo DSa, on my xbox and when I get a tablet I'll have it on there too. It's great for all ages and fun!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|this book captures your attention from page one. It truely puts into prospective &#34;Be careful what you ask for&#34; as well as eith every action there is a reaction. I found myself unable to put this book down until i reached the end!  My family suffered through feeding themselves and no clean laundry while I was capgivated by King! definitely a must read
B0054JZC6E|4.0|my kids are addicted to this game....they cant wait to pick it back up to unlock a new level.  need more opportunity to earn more points.
B006WPSQVC|1.0|This flick would have been a fail on TV.  I felt like I was watching a Christian Channel Flick. It was filled with pledges to love Jesus blah blah. Horrible and not worth paying $1.00 for.  Poor cast.  Poor story.  If you're a right wing christian you will love it.  I hated it.
006091307X|2.0|I suppose this is another book that makes me feel stupid. I simply did not get it as a whole. I recognized the satire of contemporary Amercian culture, and saw Oedipa as an example of an American Every(wo)man caught up in the blaring, glaring expansion of America as a function of industrialism and capitalism. Oedipa did not seem a full on individual to me, and I think it was on purpose. She finds herself ghosting her way through the landscape of California in a manner only slightly more surreal than the way she ghosted her way to the moment in her life when she came home from the Tupperware Party to find out she was the will's executor. That being said, her involvement in the Trystero mystery that may or may not be a worldwide conspiracy rings almost like a post-modern trip into a psychotic break. You would think, all these things considered, the book would be far more compelling than it is.<br /><br />And, for me, it was not compelling at all, except for two passages that never get revisited. When Oedipa reflects on Mucho's horror at working at the car lot and when she wanders the streets finding the lost people of the town, finding the muted horn symbol everywhere she goes. Both scenes are powerful in language, imagery and are ripe with meaning, but they are quickly over and never revisited. Say what you will about a writer using an economy of words to get his point across, but while Pynchon does this in these two passages well, he seems to go on an on about things that are less compelling and, seemingly, less important. As an example, I know there had to be a reason for the whole mess on the island, but for the life of me I just never cared.<br /><br />I am left wondering if the book is a statement about our need to communicate and our need for privacy and freedom being at odds or if I am off the mark. Then there is an existential aspect as Oedipa is left, one by one, by all the men she meets in her life. She is, in the end, left entirely alone to figure it all out for herself. That's really all I took from the book, that an awesome title that is not explained until the end and wonderfully so. I did love the way the book ended, leaving it up to the reader to decide what he or she makes of the whole thing.<br /><br />For such a short book, it took a long time to read. Mainly because I found myself not wanting to read anymore. A few wonderful passages wedged in between a lot of boring weirdness that failed to capture my imagination at all. All that being said, this is simply one uneducated reader's opinion. I am all for literary fiction that gets you thinking, even if you need a companion book to get all the references (oi!)but where TCoL49 failed to me is in the simplest aspect of story telling. The Read. For me, Lot 49 was just not a very good read.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|these headphones are amazing. i sold my dres to get new headphones and i chose these. i find it odd that no one sells these headphones but adorama camera on amazon.<br />sound quality: 5/5<br />comfort: 5/5<br />durability:5/5<br />sound leakage : 3.5/5<br />cable: 1/5<br /><br />i did return these and it was solely because of the cable. the cable is heavy, coiled, long, and is not able to detach from the headset. as soon as i tried to strech the cable to see how far it would go, part of the coil never returned to original shape, and now made a large coil compared to the small coil loops. also being 6'2\\", wearing the headsets with my ipod, the coiled cable went down to my knees when the ipod was in my pocket.<br /><br />had there been a shorter, not coiled cable, i would have loved to keep these headphones.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|these utensils are the greatest...not only they sturdy and ergonomic but they stand up on their own so there is less mess in the kitchen to clean up after!
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|Worthless. Will not even open for me. Maybe if I downgrade back to my original Droid I can play this game.
B005ONTD42|2.0|Purchased based on a review from NPH, but like a previous reviewer stated it's way overhyped. What I didn't realize is that this only goes forward. It's like a car with only forward gears. If you want to go backwards, you have to turn in one direction and go forward until you are facing the other way. Not very practical when you're up against an object. If it had reverse, it would be a significant improvement. But it seems they rushed this out and chose the lowest bidder for a manufacturer. Very cheaply made and seems like it would not last the test of time. I'm returning mine now and I may purchase again once improvements are made and the price comes way down.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a good app and that you get 150000 points if u rate this game that's mostly why I wrote this you should get it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This has become my regular everyday Bible. I use it for my daily reading on my Fire and use it on my phone to check verses.
B0014I4KIK|4.0|I like the artist and the songs. The title track reminds me of the 60s artist Lulu. What I am disappointed in is the CD recording quality. There is actual distortion on the opening track piano. The instrumentals especially but even the vocals sound like they were recorded hitting the low end of the red zone.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Started 30 Day shred 12 days ago and actually look forward to doing it daily. I honestly cannot believe the transformation I am seeing in my body already. I'm down several inches in my waist and my pants do not fit!! And, it must be noted that this is with me doing a modified version due to a recent foot fracture. I'm doing all upper body movements to the max but am limited to one leg at this point. The results are incredible. I highly recommend trying it out!

0385535139|3.0|Of all of John Grisham's books, this was the slowest and hardest to get into.  I put it down at different points and read other books.  It did get better close to the end.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|My 3 girls and I enjoy playing the games on this app and challenge each other to beat high scores.  Some games are more fun than others but it seems that when there's a game that one doesn't like, another picks it up and runs with it so it's been good for all.
B0031RS42K|3.0|Not my favourite Dan Brown book but has its moments. I found the technical explanations too cumbersome and the 'deception' is played out for far too long.<br /><br />Still it has some moments of great intrigue and some well spun action.<br /><br />I feel that I took too long to read this one which didn't help.<br /><br />Overall quite satisfying but could have been so much better.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|Crashes with a forced closed whenever opened. I wish I never downloaded this app. Please, do not give this company any money.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|Great product, was exactly as described works perfectly. I watch this movie every yr with my kids or Christmas, I am unable to be home this yr and am happy to have found this copy. It was shipped quickly and I received it in plenty of time to watch it on Christmas where I am while my kids watched it at home.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I managed to read the whole thing mainly because I was too stubborn to give up, but I skipped a lot of it. Boring, slow and tedious. Hope the next one is better!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Best game ever. I would rate it six stars if I could!!! Awesome!!!!!! Fun games that make it easy to consume time!!
B007E6YYLO|5.0|I love the way important issues were played out. We start to see another side of Rick. Definately one of the best episodes this season.
B001J3U22S|1.0|Sorry, I'm a huge Dune fan but I cannot say anything nice about this book or the Butlerian Jihad trilogy. It was really quite bad. The whole thing was forced and repetitive. There was a lot of wasted space with characters thinking the same thing over and over again. The authors forgot something really important -> we know how it end. It ends where Dune starts. Their obligation was to keep the reader engaged while knowing all the fact. It fall short.<br /><br />-spoiler alert-<br /><br />Look I know that they can fold space. I know they are going to figure it out. I know what a navigator is and how one becomes one. So why drag me through the creation story. Boring boring boring. Additionally, the whole thinking machine was a terminator rip off and naming the thinking machine antagonist Omnius is both trite and lazy. Don't get me started on the , yawn, Titans.<br /><br />I finished the third in the trilogy just because. Overall the whole series was a waste of time. I think I may re-read Dune just to cleanse my brain.
B0061S073A|5.0|I have hated letting my kids play with my kindle fire...But now this app only gives them access to what I give them access to.  They are essencially trapped in the world I set for them!!!!  Love it...Now they cant mess up my games! !! WOOOHOOO
0800177363|5.0|As someone who works in palliative care, this movie touches on what matters most in live when faced with life's uncertainties. A surprising role for Robin Williams, he knocks it out of the park. May really change yoiur perspective on what is truly important in life.
B002LII6KA|5.0|loved the movies, needed to update my collection with DVDs (in place of VHS). Nice set. Fun series of movies.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The you version is functional and versatile.  I like the mobility and tools books can't offer. I recommend it.  encourage using it also.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|best mahjong I have played yet. good story mode that keeps u wanting to play more. has some fun achievements as well
0439023513|4.0|If you have read any of my other review this one is no different then the rest of them. It has a slow start but superb ending. It was very shocking a not expected but also sad. This definitely was a great book.
B004R13U6Y|4.0|Recommended to anyone reading pdf files.  I've used this app for a long time and it keeps getting better. Buy it! Worth it.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|this works great for spreadsheets and documents.  love this app for my kindle fire.  easy to manage and send docs.
B004L49K20|4.0|(Amazon still hasn't allowed for giving half star ratings, so I will qualify my rating above as being ***1/2 stars rounded up to 4)<br /><br />Let's face it, the Killers made the world safe for 80's synthpop again. And free from irony, too. Plenty of new bands (Cut Copy, Ladyhawke) have ridden this New Wave wave to success, and even some old acts like New Order put a record in as well.<br /><br />So it's only natural that 80's pop giants Duran Duran, who have been releasing albums steadily all along, would be a part of this resurgence, if only by accident.<br /><br />While it's clear that the band's best hooks are long behind them (the catchy \\"Girl Panic\\" is the only track that clearly sounds like a hit single), this is a polished and consistent effort by them. Enlisting Mark Ronson and Spike Stent in the studio was a smart move, and the focus on blending old and new sounds keeps it from getting monotonous or overly nostalgic.<br /><br />I think if you took the strongest songs from Medazzaland onwards and put them on one CD, you'd have one of their best albums. DD were always more of a singles band, anyways. Maybe outsourcing the songwriting like Aerosmith has done? Just a thought.
B0015AARJI|5.0|First off I have to say those looking at other controllers online seeing them for 20 dollars or less, DON'T EVEN CONSIDER BUYING THEM! Though some may look very similar to real brand name, these knockoffs are cheap Chinese creations that often perform only as good as their quality allows; which is not much. I would recommend that you put the extra cash into getting this official ps3 controller. It performs great, the battery is long lived, at around 4-6 hours of play (and I play alot), the weight is little hefty but feels good in your hands. Just make sure you already have a usb charging cable for them, or get one when you buy it. I also like the feature if you hold down the PS button with a already connected controller, it will power on the ps3 if it is off. Also the wireless version is worth it, no wires gives you so much freedom to move where you want, how you want, and no worrying about pulling out cords accidently or tripping over them (I used to always do this with my ps2 lol).<br />Overall I highly recommend this controller over any others, worth every penny.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|Soooooo much better than it was previously!! Just like my phone app. Works great on my kindle.  Thank you for the update!!!
0439023491|4.0|After reading the first book in a week I immediately jumped into the second one. These books though can have a pretty slow start to them in the first part but in the second and third part it picks up and gets to be a wonderful book.
B005K17RU0|4.0|this app is cool and awesome because i can look at the local weather, but it takes wi-fi to work
B005I6EVUG|5.0|LOVE this case!  When I was looking for a case for my Kindle Fire, this was one of the more pricey ones, but I figured I may as well get one that I liked looking at.  It is well worth it.  It is visually appealing, soft, flexible, and durable.  It is also sturdy enough to allow me to prop up my Kindle when I do not feel like holding it. I use my Kindle daily, and this case completely meets my needs.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This app is so cool!  I give it five stars!  It is fun to collect nuts and buy outfits and utilities to have upgrades to make you more immune to crashes.  It is also fun to avoid hazards. The music is great too!
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|I didn't purchase this on amazon, but I do love this film. It is certainly one to own. Not to mention it has quality in many ways (glowing cinematography, screenplay is delicious, Owen W is delightful) but it is good for gatherings with friends. I have had a MIP inspired party since my first viewing...
0545425115|5.0|First there was the Harry Potter mania, then the TWILIGHT saga hit the stratosphere, and now we are on the cusp of possibly the next big cultural phenom; THE HUNGER GAMES.  By the time you read this you might have seen the movie based on the first book in a series by author Suzanne Collins.<br /><br />Is the book worth your while?<br /><br />Before we get to that, let's take a look at some of the things the book isn't.  There have been a few negative reviews, and some of their claims are so bogus, it makes you wonder if they read the book.<br /><br />Bogus Claim #1:  The story is incredibly violent.  Based on a comparison to what?  FLUFFY THE BEAR GOES TO BALLET SCHOOL?  Seriously, except for a few scenes where wounds are described, most of the violence wouldn't make your granny cringe.<br /><br />Bogus Claim #2:  There's too much killing.  Here's the deal.  In the story, twenty-four `tributes'---boys and girls ages 12 to 18---are pitted against one another in mortal combat in a natural `arena' and must fight to the death until only one is left.  But most of the combat and the killing takes place `off-page', if you will.  The reader sees it all through the eyes of the heroine, Katniss Everdeen, and she only witnesses about half a dozen of the killings.<br /><br />Bogus Claim #3: Katniss is too bloodthirsty.  Huh?  You can count the number of fighters Katniss personally slays on one hand and have digits left over.<br /><br />Bogus Claim #4:  Katniss comes across as more of a boy than a girl.  An even bigger huh?  Yeah, Katniss is strong-willed.  Yeah, she's independent.  `That' makes her boyish?  Give us a break.  Or is it that she hunts to support her loved ones?  Oh, sure, there are those of the female persuasion who go into hysterics at the thought of sweet little Bambi being shot dead with an arrow.  But there are men just as wimpy.  And there `are' women who hunt.  It's not a trait exclusive to males.<br /><br />Bogus Claim #5:  Katniss lacks depth; she hardly ever shows any emotion.  Excuse me?  She's an emotional wreck when her father dies, and only keeps it together because her mother falls apart and she realizes someone has to take charge or they'll all die.  She has incredible love for her younger sister.  And at several points in the story, she breaks down or nearly does.  No, she doesn't bawl her brains out every time something bad happens, but strong people aren't weepy wusses.<br /><br />Not So Bogus Claim #6:  More than a few critics have complained that Katniss doesn't `change' during the course of the story.  For literary types, a character has to undergo some sort of psychological transformation in order for a story to ring their selective chimes.  And they have a point in that Katniss is pretty much the same girl at the end of the story that she was at the start.  Inferior writing?  Not hardly.  A lot of people in real life bop along without ever changing.<br /><br />Okay.  Now that we've looked at what the story isn't, let's take a look at what it is.<br /><br />THE HUNGER GAMES is a riveting tale of a girl in a future world who must fight for her very survival.  It's not an actionfest so much as a character study.  The combat doesn't begin until 150 pages in, but once it does, you can't stop reading.<br /><br />Collins is a marvelous writer.  Her prose flows so naturally and beautifully that you can't get enough.  Her characters are well-realized and not bland ciphers.  You get to know Katniss Everdeen as well as you know your best friend.<br /><br />Permit me to insert a personal note and say that for me, one of the most fascinating aspects of the story is the prime subtext.  Namely, how `government', in this case the dreaded Capitol, tries to run every aspect of the lives of those under its sway.  How those in power lord it over those they deem inferior.  How even in the face of such monumental arrogance, the human spirit struggles to be free.<br /><br />On our Perfecto Meter scale of 1 to 10, THE HUNGERGAMES merits a solid 10.  It's quite simply one of the best books you will read.  Snag a copy today and treat yourself.
B00377V6J2|5.0|There are a couple of these on Amazon and if you're wondering, yes this IS the DVD and CD combo pack.  The twenty minute performance of \\"Texas Flood\\" is worth the $16 alone.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|Absolutely wonderful. I found this novel while doing a search for new Horror titles for my Nook. The cover is striking & after reading the sample, I immediately purchased the book--the consumed in a 3 days. Whether you are male or female, you will sympathize & fall in love with the main character--Sophia Parsons. A troubled, smart, but capable Wiccan (loved that aspect), you will enjoy her journey of discovery. A book that will satisfy adult & YA fans of magic, vampires & the supernatural world.
