1476712042|5.0|I would reccommend these sellers. They were quick about getting books out. the books were all in shape described. very very satisfied with their service and look for them in the future for other purchases.
B009RX85N0|5.0|This was exactly what my daughter wanted for her birthday and she loves this series.<br />The price was really great too.
B00FPGSPQU|4.0|It went down a different path than them all waking up after being drugged. It had its funny moments. But would I watch it over and over again like the 1st one. No.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This game. is really good. It is better than. the second version.  you get to fight zombie samurais,  and you can get special abilities and extra guys!
B002PZC8BM|5.0|That's a quote from one of the episodes, which are all excellent. This is an great series for anyone who watches crime dramas.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is great. I love it. its like having a real horse. I recmand getting this game. its so fun. why I like this game is because I love horse and would want one someday so I could learn. something from this game that would help me with my horse and riding
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|Watched this move yes it was a love store, but I like movies about witches, good or bad.<br />Would recommend this movie to watch
B00942Y4IY|5.0|If you love SciFi, this is great. I followed the series closely and thought this was a great beginning to what I already knew. Wish I would have watched it sooner!
B0014ERKO0|5.0|At least it gives some closure to &#34;Stargate&#34; fans. I sure wish the series would never have ended though. I miss both &#34;Stargate&#34; and &#34;Stargate Atlantis&#34;.
B00EO4SBSG|5.0|Like every Trivium album this one is different then it's predecessor, this is not a bad thing though.  It is still a very heavy album.  Trivium cut no corners with this album, the guitars are fast/heavy/melodic and the drumming is also very good.  I will emphasize that if you are not a fan of the \\"singing\\" Matt Heafy, then you may not like this album.  There is a lot of aggression in Matt's voice, but the coruses have a lot of singing. Some of the vocals are double/trippled/quad layered. You can hear David Draiman's influence in the vocals, not so much the instruments. I will say that while strife is a decent track, imo it is by no means the best song on this album.  It took me a few listens but I'm getting hooked to this album.  It's good to hear real musicians who can actually play their instruments in this era Lady Gaga, Beiber, etc.
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|The game was both challenging and fun.<br />Really enjoyed it.<br />Do not play many games on my Kindle but this was a winner.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This application works good, never fail. I have been ussing it at my Kindle device daily and it is Ok for me.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|The app was fluent and simple. Great for starters and experienced Dj's. I've never seen anything as great as this app!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|me and my family love this game and we think its awesome! my younger siblings are always asking me to play the &quot;car game&quot;! overall its an amazing game that is easy to understand for young or old!
B00BQ1DATU|4.0|I like the music but someone thought that running it through a distortion box would give it an ambient feeling.  I would rather hear it clean.  It sounds like an old record that has been played too many times.<br />Other than that I like it.  If they ever do a remaster I may buy it again.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|This program is very fast and has all the features other programs miss.....very easy to create and manage your appointments!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very entertaining.....a lot better but similar to Temple run...I like it much better..great graphics and fun game play. A must have.
006226589X|5.0|I love mysteries and thought I'd try this to listen to on the way to work.  It was very good.  Mr. Stevens does a great job with characters, so really got into it.  I didn't guess the killer, so it was very good.<br /><br />Would recommend this.
B004S49YVU|5.0|I found this an enjoyable read, a great escape from the days stresses. It was very hard to put down. I kept finding my self wanting to read just one more chapter
B00992CF6W|5.0|My kids love this game....lets them use their creativity to build their own virtual world!  I just have to limit their time on it, now!
B001CEE1YE|5.0|excellent story, awesome fx (for the time of the movie), great impression overall (acting a bit weak, though). may look a little naive now, but still - loved it. and blue-ray rules ))
B009PMEEY2|3.0|I am playing on the kindle fire hd 7 inch. The graphics are very well done.  However, the screen will freeze, or else won't highlight all the tiles selected.  As this is a timed game, these glitches take away from the game.  Also, the game has over heated my kindle twice. Both times the game closed by its self.  It may have been for the best, as I did not realize hot the kindle had become.  Developer and Amazon, please fix these issues!  I'm not keeping the game only because am concerned it may damage my tablet.
B0043XQ1TE|2.0|I find myself wondering why I bought this every time I try to listen to it.  It is hard for me to listen to the whole thing because I am so bored with it after just a few songs.  The dynamics are almost void with this sound.  If you're looking for something with layered textures and interesting mixtures of sound, you won't find it here.  This is pretty dull and gets monotonous after a few songs.<br /><br />Just my opinion...
B000F8O35U|5.0|It was great to watch with now grown children and know my new grand daughter will love it too as she grows up!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I use this app. everyday.its simple,effective and wakes. me up everytime. It saved my job because I work odd hours and it allways wakes me up.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|One of the Funniest sitcoms ever...I watch it over and over!  Can't wait for each season as it is released
159463176X|3.0|I have to admit, as much as I enjoy Hosseini's books (Kite Runner is still a favorite of mine), this book was a little confusing to follow along. There are so many actors that played into the main protagonists (Abdullah and Pari)' lives, and the author insisted on telling us their stories. Some of it was a little unnecessary because then he wouldn't finish the stories and the reader is left kinda suspended. The ending also left me a little disappointed: the protagonists finally found each other but it was a little late, and there was so much unexplained for Pari, I don't know how we could possibly be satisfied with it.<br /><br />In all, I may have to re-read it at a later date.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|A great family movie w entertainment and suspense.  Works great on the go for the boys. Highly recommended a must see
B008D28HYS|4.0|This is a great puzzle game. So far I'm still on the easy lecel, but it's great fun. My only complaint is that it eats the battery quickly.
B00A285OOW|5.0|I always thought Elizabeth married for love and this book opened my eyes to the true history of her life and the lack of love in it due to her Mother using her as a pawn to get her on the throne.
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|If you owned the game ever....Watch it. It gives a really cool back story to the video game.... m m
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I hardly ever give.5 . Stars. This book is amazing. The beginning May confuse you but it picks up quickly. I couldn't put it down. Amazing.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It has a lot of detail.<br />Loved it all. I started  to read it and could not stop until I was done with it
B00F91RYL8|2.0|I wouldn't say this movie was exceptionally great, nor original.  The movie was very predictable.  It didn't seem much different than any other zombie movie out there, such as Resident Evil, 28 days, etc.  I probably wouldn't have even bothered finishing it, except I was on a flight while watching and did not have anything else to do.
B0002S947K|5.0|My wife absolutely loved this cd!!!! Sh already had one song downloaded but wanted more of his music to enjoy .
B003OTLVAW|5.0|This SHM sacd is unbelievable.. Was going to have a quick listen after purchase , then after 30sec I was lost in its sonic bliss, and sat through the who album. Through a pair of yamaha DXR 10s, Velodyne suB and direct from the oppo 105s outs... Dire straits is in da house!! Clean, tight and punchy bass and one definitive album equals Sonic Heaven! For less than the price of a hdmi cable, this you CAN hear the difference....<br />Highly recommended
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Love criminal minds the computr kept freezing so can u pease fix that but other than that I love Amazon instant video
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|A friend exposed me to QotSA on their Songs for the Deaf album, which was fantastic. So, I obtained their other albums and on the whole am quite pleased with their work.<br /><br />However, with this album the ensemble has really fine-tuned their sound. Many times in previous albums there were seeds of greatness glistening with promise; this album sees those seeds come to full fruition. I am more than happy with my purchase; I listen to this album frequently--some really great things going on in here. Check it out!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Absolutely loved the book!! It keeps the reader interested throughout the whole book. Its a very original and well written book. I truly enjoyed it.
0061992860|5.0|5 stars because this book covers the basics to survive in any situation.  This book could be life or death.  Great book for any prepper , survivalist, camper.  I recommend it 100%.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Just the right difficulty level to make it fun,  enjoyable,  and addictive. Looking forward to more new levels to continue the challenge.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|Since I started using TED I have found it to be very interesting.  There are many different subjects for the talks.  Also they add new talks reguraly.
B004L0NGEC|4.0|I like the idea of being able to have my pics available to view instantly. The only thing I dislike is when deleting some pictures it takes 3 or 4 times for it to share. What am I possibly doing wrong?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love the app and the movie. despicable me 1 and 2. It is awesome. You could  improve the app a little more.
1612930425|4.0|I came to Pride and Prejudice having seen the 1940 movie adaptation. Long heralded as one of the best-told love stories in literature, I expected a book filled with passion and details of the encounters of Elizabeth Bennett and Fitzwilliam Darcy.<br /><br />What I got was something much slower, a cautious dance between two people who at first dislike each other but slowly begin to admire each other in their infrequent meetings, and later begin to love. However, I enjoyed the dance very much. The slowness of the relationship made me want it to happen more intensely, and when it finally did, about 4/5 of the way through the story, I was elated. Admittedly, I found some parts before that moment to be a bit dull and mundane, but Jane Austin was a wonderful writer whose wit and flourish kept me going.<br /><br />This book is not for everyone; modern readers who crave a quick pace and constant action will not be satisfied. But if you can relax and let yourself go back in time when love took time and life moved more slowly, you will not be disappointed with this story.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|The story plot is one that I enjoyed reading. I love how the author manages to let my imagination runs amazingly!
0545586178|5.0|After having read the first book in this series, I should have known this book would surprise me. What I thought was going to be a quick jump into rebellion and war turned into a more gradual relationship study. This delighted me. Author Suzanne Collins' strength is in her characters and her illustrations of their changes over time due to adversity. Catching Fire allows us to get to know the people we fell in love with in the first book before the final showdown but without skimping on the action.<br /><br />Katniss and Peeta go on their tour of the districts as the most recent victors of the Hunger Games. Their ambivalence at being the poster children of the games becomes more uncomfortable when President Snow gives Katniss an ultimatum to convince him that she really loves Peeta. Without knowing her own heart or how her actions can truly cause change, Katniss is stuck between two very hard rocks.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Setup is a little squirrely.  If you are running a VPN on your setup machine it interferes with setup but not operation.  Once set up is done, works flawlessly.
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games is a dystopian novel about a girl named Katniss who in order to save her young sister Primrose from certain demise volunteers to compete in the 74th annual Hunger Games. This event is held each year to demonstrate the capitol's power over the twelve districts by choosing two tributes from each district to fight to the death for fame and wealth. Katniss is from district 12 where a tribute has not won for decades.<br /><br />What could have been another adequate and typical story about rebellion and an unfair government is exciting and fresh in author Suzanne Collins' hands. Her protagonist Katniss is highly developed and her storytelling is top notch. Each moment is important for moving the story along which keeps the reader engaged at all times. I couldn't wait to read the second book.
B00DGRCA4I|5.0|I'm not normally a fan of live music CD's, but I read enough good review of this box set to give it a shot.<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />The 3 studio albums that Jimi and the Experience put out really seem &#34;sterile&#34; compared to this box set.  Sure the songs are good, but you REALLY get how good they were when they played live.  Jimi and his band really shine, really let go, when they jam live.  Amazing guitar work overall, and the band really keeps up, which is impressive considering how weird he gets at time.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
0439023513|4.0|This is the action-packed conclusion of the Hunger Games series. While I was mostly satisfied with this book, I was left with some questions, mostly about the auxiliary characters. This is a testament to Collins' writing. She makes even the most minor characters interesting enough to require a follow up.<br /><br />Now that the revolution has begun, Katniss is being recruited by the President of the rebel forces to be the face of the revolution, the Mockingjay. Unsure of whether her loyalty truly lies with them or whether she can do any good following orders, she fights constant physical ailments and devolves mentally as the effects of the arena begin to show. Her struggle as she heals and then digresses is brilliantly captured and gets quite a bit of attention in spite of the chaos between the Capitol and the new District 13.
0316098337|4.0|This novel is an extraordinary imaginative achievement. Told primarily in the voice of five-year-old Jack, Room is the story of a kidnapped woman's captivity and the child whose birth rescues her from despair. Jack's Ma is a magnificent character, one whose ingenuity enables her to build a decent, even joyful, life for a beguiling boy who doesn't even know he's a captive, and the reader finds herself engrossed in both the how-to details of the life Ma has conjured for Jack and the wide-eyed delight a child takes in his familiar and beloved world. But one day soon, Ma's little boy will grow too big for their 11 by 11 cell, which means Jack's mother's ingenuity will be tested again. All too often, a novel built on a schtick scenario -- the story of a kidnapped sex captive told by the child born of neverending rape -- loses interest after the author lays out the basic scenario, but NOT Room. Donoghue hooked my interest on the first page and kept it to the last. Highly recommended.
B00DW36G32|3.0|Not a bad movie I think it could have had quite a bit more depth.  I actually expected that having two incredibly talented actors.  Also i hope that we see Peter from Heroes (Milo Ventimiglia) in more roles he is quite the talented actor himself.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|It's almost unreal to think that on 11/9/89 the Berlin Wall fell. I watched it that night - LIVE -via satellite, as the victims of Communism and its little sister Socialism cheered, kissed and sat on the wall, and took sledge hammers to it...the same wall that for 30 years separated Freedom from Slavery...on this night brothers and sisters, fathers and children crossed over and through the Wall and embraced in Freedom. I remembered in the early 1960's watching on the evening news as women and men were machine-gunned trying to climb the barbed wire fence erected prior to the concrete one.<br />How soon we forget.<br />I imagine no adult today under 40 has any memory or knowledge of this event. Or else why would they now be worshiping Socialism in our Universities and High Schools, and in our 'mainstream media' and in our very Government and in the White House. The Socialists in our Congress - openly 'serving'and subverting our Republic; and the Socialists in our Media - Belafonte, Glover,Asner etc; the Leftists in our broadcast media...can they all be so stupid?<br />This movie should be required watching in all public schools. But no, it would be called 'hate speech' or 'extremist propaganda...Tea Party fear-mongering'.<br />'The truth will set you free' - as a famous 'philosoper' once said.<br />But 'great lies' will keep you bound.<br />If you think this will never happen again, read and watch CSPAN: IRS, NSA, GOOGLE, the tools of today's Dictator Barrack Hussein Obama and his criminal Attorney General Eric Holder.<br />How thick are their files of their enemies?...as shown in this movie with the Stasi Files - no, their digital files are in the Utah facility...every email, 'friend' on facebook and twitter...their email address book.<br />Watch this movie...it is brilliant in every way. It is scary, and it is emotional. Read the Reviews here by people who lived it.  Make your kids watch it...and then discuss it.<br />If you have never read or seen '1984' do so. Itis no accident this movie takes place in the real 1984. Big Brother is watching us today. And he is not about 'hope and change'. He is about 'the fundamental transformation of America'- he said it, and he means it. I would like to send this movie to him; would he watch it? Or would the FBI come knocking at my door. As he said at the White House Correspondents Dinner: \\"I am not the strapping young Muslim Socialist I was then...\\". No,he is older but no wiser, and still a Socialist. Why do Leftists not learn from the failure of 100 years of a failed ideology, 72 million dead/starved/tortured/executed? Is that not the definition of insanity? Watch this film; you will learn much and never forget it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome! I can`t wait for 0.8.0. five stars! Johann and tomasso did a great job. Ps plsee add horses.
0385742886|5.0|I am really enjoying this story..it's been fun to read! (:  I was a Twilight fan that switched over to Hunger Games and then Divergent. This is my 4th series and I'm really enjoying it. Darker than the others, but really good. The author is very very good at the imagery that is SO important with stories like this
B00C2ISGQI|5.0|Great movie, I love it!!!! Mel Gibson, long-time heartthrob of the silver screen, came into his own as a director with Braveheart, an account of the life and times of medieval Scottish patriot William Wallace and, to a lesser degree, Robert the Bruce's struggle to unify his nation against its English oppressors.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|Wow thanks a lot another game that wont install on fire I have more than enough data but it keeps saying I don't have enough thanks a lot Kindle Fire I just love you.
B00F35BV64|5.0|I LIKED THIS MOVIE IT WAS FAST PACED WITH GOOD SPECIAL EFFECTS. I GREW UP WITH THE ORGINAL TV SERIES AND THE ACTORS DID A GREAT JOB USING SIMILAR MANNERISMS OF THE ORGINALCREW.<br />HOPE TO SEE ANOTHER MOVIE.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|A very addicting and fun game.  You can play bingo or slots.  You can help your friends to complete their locations,
B002QVZ71I|5.0|Fast streaming excellent viewing experience. Good yearly bargain compare to netflix as you get multiple benefits with 80 bucks prime membership.
B0012HF5NC|4.0|Great adventure fantasy. Characters stereotyped almost to the point of caricature. Eye-catching digital special effects(for its time). Great light entertainment.
B009MO5960|5.0|Long time fan of Resident Evil, ever since its release on the first playstation.  I love all the movies, and this one is especially well done with the great picture quality, and sound quality. Action scenes are awesome (which is pretty much the whole movie) with a nice home theater setup.
B00FEN000S|5.0|Best summer movie of 2013. Giant mechs and monsters done right in a long time. Wanted to see this movie more than Man of Steel, I still haven't seen that movie and I'm OK with that. Faith in humanity was restored when I found out it did really well internationally, even though it didn't garner that much attention in the US.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Great value for one of the greatest movie series of all time, the picture quality, and audio is really nice.  Glad I purchased this set.
1250038820|5.0|This is a great book - not just for a coffee table book but also to read. I really enjoyed the book and love the page. I hope he can continue his work.
B001AQMBL4|5.0|One of my all time favorite comedies with such a awesome cast.  If you haven't seen it, definitely work watching! I still watch it from time to time, always get a laugh out of it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Such a real story. There are real emotions and confusion with feelings. While I typically have trouble getting into a book where I've seen the movie first, this book was very close and more pulling than others. An amazing read!
B002HML6Y8|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time, and it's even better on blu ray.  I love the picture and audio quality. 5 stars!
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|LOVE IT!!!! Love the that you can play both sides of the empire. Great powers and great ideas! Its awesome!
B005H0IW6W|4.0|I just love the Buble'!! And who doesn't love Christmas?? Christmas is my favorite time of year and I love the music. I would have love more traditional stuff on this album, but it was good anyway!
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|Watchable, if you don't over analys. If you really think about this movie it does not make any sense, but really a lot of movies don't. I think it's worth watching.
B005HSL626|5.0|I really enjoy playing Fruit Ninja.  It is great to pass the time, and I also enjoy the new features of the recently upgraded game.  It is definitely worth the download.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|If you are a big SciFi person, you'll find Pacific Rim enjoyable in what ever mode you watch.  I'm not big on SciFi but did give the review 5 stars just the same.  The movie kept me interested and while predictable for the most part the movie played out well.  One thing that really struck home was the flashing of the &#34;future year 2020&#34;  As we sit back and realize that is barely 6 years away, the future is amoung us all.<br /><br />All I can say is, let's all just hope and pray we don't have to meet an enemy such as the huge robotic monsters.<br /><br />It is rated R for language, but would give consideration of a strong PG 13 and handle the few &#34;F&#34; bombs as they flow and don't take away from the overall film.<br /><br />Above all, you'll find the special effects (and 3D if you watch that version) to be worth the time.<br /><br />It is definitely in my 3D collection to watch again.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini is such an amazing storyteller.  He brings the characters to life and gives you a humanistic perspective of life in the Middle East.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Loved it!! I really enjoyed the mystery behind Danny's murder. I couldn't wait to start the next episode. With only 8 episodes in Season 1, it was easy to get through. I highly recommend it!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is the best hunting game ever made.This game is so fun I don't know what to do that's how fun IT is.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|it will not stream content other than netflix and youtube and hulu+.  it will NOT EVEN stream my AMAZON PRIME!
B007THA4FI|5.0|Very interesting characters with a well developed story. Would definitely recommend this book. An easy read but  thoroughly engaging story.
B004H4XDBI|5.0|So, when I first read the summary for this book, I was so sad to find out that Mia and Adam were no longer together in this  book. After seeing everything they both go through in If I Stay, I felt like their relationship was strong and unbreakable and after reading the first book, I understand Mia and Adam more than I ever thought that I could.<br /><br />The book is told from Adam's point of view which I really enjoyed, you got to see how much he changed in three years and how his and Mia's relationship was seen through his eyes, whereas in If I Stay you got to see their relationship through Mia's eyes. I liked get to read the book from a male POV considering most of them are from a girls.<br /><br />Adam's band has become hugely popular and it's all because of the songs he wrote after Mia had left him. He has everything it seems that he wanted but, he is not happy with his life, he doesn't love music the way that he used to, and his own band who used to be his best friends hate him. I really felt for him, most people have these dreams and they think once they come true and have everything they ever wanted it is going to make them happy, but sometimes it doesn't.<br /><br />Adam is walking through New York when he see's a flyer for Mia Hall performing in a Young Concert Series and he takes a chance he goes in and he listens to her play, just wanting to hear her one more time. Mia finds out he is there and they both see each other again.<br />This book tore through all of my emotions and I was definitely crying, sad, and happy throughout different parts. At first I was a little mad at Mia, how could she just abandon a person who I know she really loved and not speak to him for three years but, after Adam and Mia see each other again many things become clear from both of them and I realize how much more complicated everything was for both of them then it ever seemed.<br /><br />This book has so much emotional depth sometimes I was almost overwhelmed, I was so in tunewith both characters and I really felt their emotions as my own. I thought that this book was just as good as the first one, maybe even a little bit better. I highly reccommend this book and if you haven't read If I Stay, get on it right now! Make sure you have your box of tissues ready because this book takes you on another emotional roller coaster.
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|Fresh music. This is an album that takes some bold chances; Something that is unheard of in today's music business. There is a great future for this artist (Wow, she's only 16). Bravo Lorde, this album is vocally perfect, pure ear candy.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|What would you do if the guy that you have had a crush on for years, suddenly came up to you one day and showed interest in you and wanted to kiss you?( I don't know about you guys but, I for one would be all for it.) But, for Samantha it changes her life completely and shows her secrets about herself she never knew existed.  Angels and Demons working together on a mission to save Samantha's town Trinity from a common enemy they call \\"The Source.\\"<br />Overall, I really enjoyed the plot and story for this book. As far as a book with angels and demons in it, I felt that the plot was different from many of the angel books that I have read. The main thing that I didn't like about this book was the character introduction. I felt like you really never got to know any of the characters in the book. You first meet Samantha who is the main character but, right after you get started with the book the whole storyline and adventure begins and you really lose getting to learn about who she is and anything that can really make the reader feel  a connection to her. This book had a little bit of everything from the angels and demons to special powers and some romance (which in my opinion was one of those I just met you, I don't know you at all, but I am totally in love with you) which is what turned me off to that aspect of it. I was disappointed in the lack of character development and the development of relationships between them. I love to fall in love with a character and relate to her, want her to suceed in every way. It was hard for me to feel that for Samantha because I never felt like I really got to know her just the shallow surface.<br />What I did like about this book was the plot and storyline, even though I never completely connected with the characters, I really did enjoy reading their adventure. You were thrown into their journey in the first few pages and it had me hooked. I do definitely want to read the next book in the series and see where the story is going togo, overall a good read and defintely had me on the edge of my seat wanting to know what was going to happen next
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|This is beautiful music.  If you like Yanni you will LOVE her!<br />It is soothing but upbeat.  You will not fall asleep to this one!
B00CTGVKGQ|4.0|I chose 4 stars because the album was very good, but I didn't give it 5 stars because I paid $14 and only got 5 songs.  I saw that Lorde's new album Heroine........something or the other had the song Royals on it and many others and was cheaper than what I paid for Love Club.  Anyway, the music was for my wife, but I enjoyed listening to it as well.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I was never a Ken Follett fan until I read the first book in this series &#34;Fall of Giants,&#34; which I loved. Could not wait to start the second book.  Did not love the second book, however, until a third of the way through.  I think if I had read it as a stand-alone novel, rather than trying to connect all the characters from both books, it would not have taken me so long to get into it.  Am now looking forward to the final book.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Supernatural season 8 is great. I will enjoy watching this one over and over. It is back to its roots in being against the Demon kind and the Demon King himself, Lucifer is locked in his cage and Sam & Dean are determined to slam the gates of hell shut once and for all, until...<br /><br />watch and find out
1451620829|1.0|When your done reading this book you feel like you need a shower. What did i take away from it ? Peter Criss not only is a megalomaniac, but a CREEPY one at that. I loved this band and it's members growing up as a kid, it's just heartbreaking to see what's behind the mask of pretty much all the members.
B00FN811SY|5.0|I love the easy access and the simplicity of the application. This application is so informative all the needed information in one place.
B000CBEWZ6|1.0|It was the Japanese version which does not work on American DVD players. Waste of time and money. The seller failed to mention this.
B006LSZECO|5.0|There are no words for how amazing and thrilling this read is. A page Turner for sure. I know I'll be reading this again and again.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I truly enjoyed the book. It gave me clarity on my character and on the mate I choose to keep in my life.
B00E0SX118|5.0|My grandchildren love this. I watched most of it yesterday and it is really a cute movie. I highly recommend getting this one!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|i love the walking dead it's an awesome show, I can't wait till the next episode is on amazon to purchase!
1250038820|5.0|I love this book. The cover is gorgeous and the content is amazing. I am a big fan of Brandon's work and I am thrilled to see this succeed!<br /><br />I've shared the link to the page with a lot of people and I've shown my book to everyone who has passed my desk and they are all positive review.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Loved the game, quite challenging, but went through 10 puzzles in one day, I need more.  It says there are constant updates, guess I wait.
B0018RC7QE|3.0|DeNiro and Streep are pros--very engaging.  Characterizations were good all around. But the bittersweet plot was slow-moving and predictable.  Maybe what it needed was a good villain.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|It hit too close to home.  I do not have fourteen more words so I have to end this now.
B00FEN000S|2.0|It's a sad time for Hollywood.  First \\"John Carter of Mars\\".  Next \\"Battleship\\".  Now \\"Pacific Rim\\".  It's too bad the folks that produce these kinds of films can't seem to hire both script writers AND special effects guys.  Maybe the next generation of directors can figure out how bring those two disciplines back together again.  But for now, if you can turn off the logic portions of your brain, tune out the noise that passes for dialog and just drink in the visuals, you might make it through this movie.  On second thought, going to the movies shouldn't be an endurance contest.  Do something more pleasurable like bathing your cat.  You'll be doing yourself a favor.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love this show. I think I would describe it as a cross between Cranford and Little House on the Prairie.  Sweet and funny characters move story lines along quickly. I'm hooked!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works as advertised. Might come back for more if it becomes more flexible as a true streaming player by figuring out how to throw a wider variety of sources and content at the chromecast.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|One of his better books of late. Moved well from the beginning, and kept you guessing to the end. Well written.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great story line and graffics. Not too hard yet not easy. I really enjoyed this game, will be playing it again soon.
B000YJ54DU|5.0|Nothing to lose lives up to the superb writing Lee Child has produced in his previous novels, A master wordsmith an consummate suspense writer.
B0011ZVTEO|5.0|For the true Cuban Music afficianado, this is a must have. The collection of artist are brought back to the spotlight by Ry Cooder and the album is pure in it's musical offering.
B00AC8ZA3M|3.0|As someone who has been hoping that the Halo universe will see a series of feature films, I was surprised to find this one on Amazon.<br /><br />Although apparently made with a fairly limited budget, the story line was well presented and and the character development surprisingly good. I hope that this signals the start of something more ambitious, like a film version of the Fall of Reach or a film on the complete back story of Master Chief. Now that Ender's Game has been made into a movie...
B004SIP8JI|4.0|A decent love story.  There are a few goofs in the movie, such as the historic dates and who actually invented the elevator, and the possible plot hole that Kate may just be Stuart's great-great grandmother even though they dated during the few years together and may have slept together, but Hugh Jackman's performance definitely sets this amongst his best work of his career, and though it's tricky to see him paired up with someone like Meg Ryan, they still make an exceptional couple.  Most women will thoroughly enjoy it, and some men may find it a charming viewing from a guy's typical flick.  A 4/5 rating is sufficient.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|.....it works and it really fun  but it really makes u think on some levels and I love it soo much because it works on my kindle
B00594XOZU|1.0|I have tried for 4 days to setup my account.  I get the same message &#34;..this is taking too long...try again later...&#34;<br />If you can't set it up you can't use it.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|As an extreme introvert, I found this book fairly helpful. However, I could see where someone who was merely 'shy' might find it a tad redundant... I'm truly clueless when it comes to socializing, though, and, while I put forth a lot of effort into learning new things and am constantly adjusting my paradigms and expectations of life, this book made me realize that I don't do that in my social-life and I should... I also didn't realize that people actually have goals in mind when they conduct a conversation... I just say what comes to mind and hope that no one stares at me askance. My main goal in a conversation is to end it, so I can divert the attention away from myself... but then I find myself walking the streets alone at night, longing for someone to talk to (but fearing that if I did talk, I would not measure up to expectations). It's a special kind of self-inflicted torture. Though a lot of what this book says seems obvious (i.e. the happiest moments are shared with people, so interacting with them is key to overall happiness) sometimes the elephant in the room is the thing you ignore the most thoroughly, until someone forces you to look at it. So... I guess what I'm trying to say is thanks for giving me a push in the right direction, Mr. Murphy :)
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|It's frustrating to wait to re-energize. You can buy what you need, but if I did, I would get hooked and go broke, so I'm gonna be cheap on this one. Overall it's fun and entertaining.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is very very fun I will tell something about it if you don't know this press edit then next to it will be external then click it then write any of your friends account for minecraft PE  after you write it then just enter then go back to title screen then go to accounts then it would be there.
1250037751|5.0|Over the past year I've &#34;had to read&#34; a number of books that really didn't interest me because they were the selections of the book club to which I belong.  It was a pleasure to actually pick up a book that not only captured my interest from the beginning but held it all the way through.  I read it in just a few hours (while doing the laundry)...and was pleased that the author &#34;finished&#34; the story.  So many writers today build a good story then &#34;wrap it up&#34; in a manner that leaves the reader dangling.  While Mr. Sloan did leave one detail open for speculation in the end, he did a good job of bringing it all together for the reader so there is a sense of completion and satisfaction.<br />There were a number of nuances and ideas slipped into the narrative throughout the story that can make one pause and reflect.  In short, I recommend this book.  It is a mystery, a lesson in philosophy, and perhaps you might find a sentence or two that will stir your thought processes to say...Hummm, not that is a really good idea, how can it be done?
1609611543|5.0|I was a skeptic when I bought this book. But medical problems (intense diarrhea) forced me to try this diet.  Following this gluten free regimen has changed my life!! I am no longer confined to my home. I admit that I find the diet boring, time consuming and oft times expensive, but the results are worth it for me. Do check with your medical provider before you start on this regimen. Good Luck!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Left me wanting more and there is more alot more in the sequels. very descriptive and a good book for teens as well. and with the movie out cant wait to see how well it follows the story
B006PIXKVW|1.0|loved the book; reallly didn't like the movie, even though I had expected to.  Unnecessary changes made the story weaker.  If Bambi's mother can die, then Sarah's dad can die, as he does in the book.
B00DM12ANO|4.0|Plot holes galore but a fun movie to watch. Just sit back and enjoy the theory. That in itself is really interesting.
069111966X|5.0|In retrospect, I regret very much not having read Polya's &#34;How to solve it&#34; before I went to grad school (or even better undergrad). Almost every paragraph leaves me with a feeling of deep wonder how he describes so insighfully and precisely what took me years of experience to understand.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|Never watched the Hobbit series but with this one I am hooked and will watch the remaining videos. Excellent scenery, action and suspense. A must watch.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|it wont let me load it on my kindle fire!!I give this game a F you have to delete everything to get it
B003U69IX6|4.0|Really enjoyed the theme and the movie is just good plain fun to watch. It was safe for families to watch.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|I enjoyed the first episode. I look forward to watching the rest of the season, especially seeing Henry Cavill again!
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Gotta love this style of movie. I just have a hard time seeing Tom Cruise as a hero that saves humanity. The twists are neat and the movie is nail biting in a few spots.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I wasted 45 minutes trying and retrying to get this device set up. No helpful troubleshooting. Don't waste your time and money?
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Love the effects of course. Love the tie in to the old characters and the accents of Sulu and Scotty. They characterized their original actors quite well. The movie was true mostly to the themes of the original also. Although they did change how the original Captain of the Enterprise died. Very very enjoyable.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Rather boring after  a couple of days.  and then it wanted an upgrade.  Not my type of game for my purposes
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Brilliant. Unexpected. Twists, turns and terrific planning and toying. Intrigue builds through exceptional character development. Best read in a long time. Devious and devastatingly addictive.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Left lots and lots of cliffhangers to be answered in the 6th book. Even the author admits that. Still a good read.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This game is cool because it has a lot of of heroes and you get to different version s  of them and you can be awesome at this game
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Funny and rather poignant with very good Barbara Streisand.  Reminds me of my own love/guilt experiences with my own mom, and probably will resonate with many viewers.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Addictive and fun as Uno always is. The only thing I don't care for is the wait for free scratches to earn tokens.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Wonderful acting and a portrayal of Jim Crow segregation laws and attitudes that is as powerful as any we've ever seen.  I would make this required viewing for all good citizens of the United States.  While it is a &#34;fictionalized&#34; drama, it vividly shown the horrors of the American South...not just during slavery and soon after, but in the 1950s and 60s (and continuing even today).
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Though some plot lines seem improbable in this second season, both Claire Danes and Damian Lewis continue to sustain their nuanced and high octane acting. Some of the best storytelling on TV -- intelligent scripts, with an interesting blend of action, sexual dynamics, and family relationships. Casting still top notch -- in addition to Danes and Lewis, Brody's family also excellent, especially the daughter, whose belief and trust in her father undergo a radical shift.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Hooks you in!  Excellent acting, costuming, sense of the times, character development.  Anyone who likes historical fiction will like this...although the family does have its share of angst!
B00F52YOPA|4.0|Mostly enjoyable hidden object game where you earn coins to purchase other items to furnish a room.  Don't like the rooms where you have to unscramble the clues to find what you are looking for, or the rooms where you are shown just a silhouette to find the object.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I streamed and watched a whole season in about a week.  Super!  Great characters--the good and the evil--great plot lines.  Hope they stay on the air several more seasons!
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Intouchables is one of the funniest movies I've seen, but it is not a comedy.  It touches in a way few movies can by giving such a real impression of two people connecting across class and culture.  I have a rule for movies.  If users and professionals rate a movie at the highest levels I will see it no matter what it is (as long at it is not teen oriented).  The Intouchables was a movie I stumbled upon in my search for interesting topics and ordered the disc.  This is an absolute gem, one of the best movies I've seen a few years.  It missed on nothing, hit on everything.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|I liked it- I felt like its was a solid apocalyptic flick!  I did read the book, but heard its not as good-
B004SBQGHS|2.0|The angry birds app was a memory hog. took it off to allow other applications on phone. Liked the add free part.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Rapp enters the novel at the very beginning and stays with it and the action throughout its length.  The novel is action packed and revolves around a very complex plot of intrigue and spy-craft.<br />Anyone familiar with this series (Mitch Rapp) will have difficulty putting the book down before finishing it.<br />Excellent job from an author that continues to write great stories.
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|This book just moved too slowly for me.  The author kept returning to the main character's reasons for the isolation he felt from society, but he returned to that mood several times too often for me.  I felt a kind of stasis while reading that just did not move me forward with the actual narrative.  Maybe this was deliberate; I just don't know.
B008EL25LE|3.0|I played a few levels and discovered the constant flashing lights were starting to hurt my eyes. I stopped playing but it was too late. I deleted the game and took a couple of aspirins for my new headache.  I very rarely get a headache. The game was OK, and I liked the story, but I 've played better ones. it's not worth the headache.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|I've always liked Godzilla. Big monsters destroying cities are amazing, even when the effects are cheesy or the plot is threadbare. So PACIFIC RIM was made for people like me. I can't--I won't--pretend to be objective; this movie had the right stuff. But it had more.<br />The characters were fully realized and had moments that just don't happen in big-monster movies: the hero who is NOT a loose cannon; the girl who's gung ho AND terrified; the commanding officer who has no soft spot, even for himself.<br />Guillermo del Toro created something special here. It's a great movie--so do yourself a favor and watch it. I'll be surprised if you don't watch it again and again.
B005HED11Y|5.0|This show looks better now in HD than the originals re-runs.  The picture quality and sound of this remastered show makes it worth watching again.
B00BWQW73E|5.0|Brad Stone has the heart of an investigative reporter and deftly uncovers fascinating tidbits of Amazon's history from the time it was just a thought in Jeff Bezos' head until Amazon took over the Internet world.<br /><br />\\"The Everything Store\\" is truly a love story for anyone who has watched Amazon evolve over the past eighteen years. This extremely well-written book is the result of over 300 interviews with all the major players in Jeff Bezos' life.<br /><br />Jeff is presented as an eternal optimist, an extreme risk taker and a demanding perfectionist. Basically the man we have come to love and respect who gives the customer exactly what they want even when he has to fight for his vision.<br /><br />Some of the things Jeff is recorded as saying made me laugh out loud. Some things he has said made me sit up and pay attention. Brad Stone however doesn't shy away from the realities of Jeff Bezos being a powerful leader. This makes this story riveting and Brad Stone makes sure you feel like you were there when every challenging decision was faced.<br /><br />I have read other books on Amazon and have found them all intriguing, however this book is such a detailed version of the history of Amazon that I'd suggest you read it first. To be honest every sentence in this book is a pleasure to read. It is the type of book that makes your heart beat a little faster in anticipation of the next tantalizing detail.<br /><br />Here are some more books on amazon if you are interested:<br /><br />[[ASIN:1591845858 One Click: Jeff Bezos and the Rise of Amazon.com]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1565848705 Amazonia: Five Years at the Epicenter of the Dot.Com Juggernaut]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1841157651 21 Dog Years: Doing Time at Amazon.com]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0066620414 amazon.com - Get Big Fast : Inside the Revolutionary Business Model That Changed the World]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0766019721 Jeff Bezos: Business Genius of Amazon.Com (Internet Biographies)]]<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
032147404X|5.0|This was the first book i bought when i didn't even have a camera yet. I was till saving some cash to buy a really nice professional camera but i wanted to learn as much as possible before i started practicing!<br />All i gotta say, putting this book's content into action right away made a huge difference in my newbs photo shots... I would definitely recommend the series to any one out there looking forard to starting a hobby or a career in this industry!
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Great album! Love her! :) many people would say eh? Violin and dubstep, really? But it is wonderful, give it a listen!
B007URVZJ6|3.0|A must for amateur. A excellent simple guide to all people want to publish a ebook. And it is free.<br />Recommended.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|Filled me with a vague sense of dread regarding the safety of the weapons stockpile in the 50s through the late 80s. Makes you sincerely question the reliability and safety of today's systems, since a large portion of the book deals with the &#34;official reports&#34; from the 1950s through 1970s highlighting the safety of these WMDs, while the author painstaking details how in many cases major accidents were avoided by sheer luck.
B008Y7J91M|5.0|This was a great touching story about a girl who had a very sad life,  and went from rags to riches and never gave up very powerful and moving story.  Love it
B00AB7HESI|5.0|The best game ever. I play this game all the time. It is hard but fun. It is the only game I play
B0027MJU00|1.0|I did not like the story line at all..did enjoy the only other book of hers I read, which was &#34;Gone Girl&#34;, but I will think again before reading another.
B001QB5S3G|4.0|Very powerful movie. Robert DeNero does an unbelieveable job playing his character. I would recommend this movie to watch but bring Kleenex.
B004ZRV3AU|3.0|Takes lots of practice to get this right. But the product works. I'd like it more if it was more fool-proof.
B009ZQJ1G4|1.0|They kill dogs! Bad! Bad! Bad! The movie had my interest until then.  I would not recommend this movie to watch.
B000LYS1Z6|5.0|This is a Fantastic LP in its own right, and in 1970, proved to be a pivotal Album for David Bowie. No more &#34;Laughing Gnomes&#34; on this LP; &#34;Running Gun Blues&#34; and the Title song are interlaced with a futuristic post-apocalyptic world where Bowie's vocals blend and blur with the lyrics very well. I prefer vinyl, and the Mercury label WAS the first release, so if you are lucky enough to find and afford a SEALED copy, by it. &#34;All vinyl is not made equal&#34;, but the early pressings rarely disappoint. If you MUST buy a CD, choose the Japanese MLp; the packaging may differ from the Mercury Jacket, but the digital quality is better than &#34;just another CD&#34; made &#34;somewhere&#34;.
B00DJZR46G|5.0|I have been a fan for many years.  This album has beautiful piano playing and lyrics.  I loved it the first time I heard and have listened to it daily since I received it.  Sir Elton does not disappoint!
B00E6F15HM|5.0|What a deal! For this low price you get both the new re-cut of P.G. live in Athens, Greece in 1987 and the generous Play music video compilation. Live In Athens 1987 improves on the now long out-of-print PoV video (VHS and laserdisc) from 1990 by including the complete concert. The songs are not cut off like on PoV. But, missing is Peter's 8mm footage that was cut into the PoV video. You also get to see opening act Youssou N'Dour set.<br /><br />If you have PoV, I recommend holding on to it and get this video as well.<br /><br />[DW]
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The series has a bit of everything in it. The characters and story line draws you in and holds you.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|An unexpected journey in any case. Perhaps that is the best kind, after all. Harold will engage your heart, perhaps lead you to think about a few questions, and probably entertain.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a wonderful challenge game<br /> u will NOT want to stop playing.  Great work for idle minds. You won't regret getting this appt.
B00B3EJ0OY|5.0|Funny and heart wrenching at the same time.  I highly recommend that you watch this and then buy it. Please.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|It isn't that I didn't like it. I think I did, anyway. It's just a strange story with a bit of a distorted &#34;flow&#34; from beginning to end. I'm not sure if I'm a fan.
B006G4F8OW|4.0|The figure was just ok. Not super awesome but good. Wanted a great detailed figure but it's not like I paid a lot for this. Still satisfied though. Gotta have my one piece set.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Every person should read Anitas Book, it sure makes you look at the World in a different way. Thank you Anita for writing it.
B00F880BWG|5.0|I love the walking Dead.<br />  I have all three seasons on disc and do not want to wait until next August to catch up. I recently got rid of cable and knowing I can still watch all the new episodes when and where I want as many times as I want is a big plus. Thanks Amazon.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is an amazing game and it's really hard to get bored of it! My friends and I play this game for hours over the weekends. Since you can rearrange the resource tiles and the number tokens, each game board is unique and requires different strategies to win...
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|Started to give this 4 stars for being such a short game - only 14 levels but I did really enjoy it so decided on the 5 stars. It does keep your old brain working and each level is something different. Can't wait to play some more of this developers games and best of all- NO ADS!!!!!!!!!!
B007FG9LIE|4.0|this one will catch your interest.  Thriller, suspense, a bit on the ridiculous side but I'm game.  It kept my interest and it was fast reading.  I will get the series to see where this story is headed.  thx
B004XMMSZG|3.0|This wouldn't work with my Dynavin stereo in my Audi A4...and I tried it in my GF's A3 with an OEM headunit and a dicelink ipod adapter, it didn't work either. It basically seemed to not be getting power, as the \\"paired\\" light wouldn't turn on.<br /><br />I emailed their support and it took them over a week to reply, not good! But they were helpful in that they suggested I try the adapter below. I was all set to return this, but figured I'd give it another go.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B003TJR2HS CableJive dockStubz+ Charge Converter and 30-pin Pass Through Adapter for iPhone, iPod, and iPad]]<br /><br />Once I picked up the adapter, it still didn't work with my Dynavin head unit. I was pretty bummed...but figured the Dynavin is a pretty crappy chinese quality stereo, so the problem is on my side. I then tried the pair of items in my GF's A3 again, and it worked flawlessly. Her stereo isn't anything special, so I can't really speak to the quality...but it's certainly sufficient.<br /><br />Pro tip: If you're on Android, download the app \\"bluetooth auto connect\\"...it will allow your phone to automatically connect to this device each time you turn your car on, and will even launch the intended music app after it's successfully connected via bluetooth.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I liked the book;  King is the best (even tho he gives out too much details about nothing and makes the book that much longer).
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I have tried several other battery apps with great claims. This is simply the best and dosent wear down the battery to do its job. Thanks for such a excellent app!
B00FJU1HLC|4.0|Not all kids' movies are interesting to the kids, but this one got their attention.  Likable characters, good story line.... so I may just buy one for our home!
B00DGN51O8|5.0|love this movie....action, love, funny....it is a movie just to watch in a friday night with the hole family and of course a lot of popcorn...even my husband liked it!!!
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|My children have enjoyed this movie time and time again. Life lessons and great sing alongside are fantastic! We loved this movie!
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|really good and fun to watch...my 12 year old son loved it!! and he will watch again, and again....good movie!!
B008EL25LE|2.0|I sort of liked the first version of Azkend, but this one is not that good. Had it not been the faotd I would not have gotten either of them. The first thing I noticed about this game is just a preference issue, but I don't think a game like this works well in landscape format. Portrait is better. The second thing is that the picture doesn't seem to fit my Kindle Fire screen correctly. Whenever there's a line of text at the bottom of the screen, the lower half of it is cut off. You would think a developer who is this proud ($4.99) for his game would make sure it works on Kindles, they are the reason for the Amazon appstore to begin with. Amazon should have also caught this problem, as they have an average of a two week testing period before they release new apps submitted to them.<br /><br />I will keep this game and play it (since I got it free), but I expected more from a game with that kind of price tag. I finished the first one in just one relaxed evening. That's not much gameplay for Five Bucks.
B0036FYO12|1.0|Movie started very slow.  Audio was poor. It was hard to figure out the plot. If you like really old movies you would enjoy this one
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I had a hard time putting this book down at night. The different lives all interlocking with each other and each learning the meaning of secrets and the price of love. I enjoyed the ending but only proves we can't live on, \\"what if' s\\".
6304698798|5.0|Do you like westerns, Clint Eastwood, and violence?  No...then don't buy this movie.  This movie is for real men! Yah!
B005544V6A|5.0|Great show.  Good acting!  Main character has a lisp but overall does a great job!  Although I'm not a lawyer, my best friend is and he is exactly like the lead actor
B00000IQC8|5.0|Kevin Smith's greatest movie ever!  I can watch this movie over and over!  Much better than Clerks II!  Must have movie!
B000065V3H|4.0|Loved this movie as a teen.  Watched it with my teens and they thought it was funny.  If you like old 80's comedies you'll like this!!!
B00DZAWPNM|5.0|The record definitely one of the best records I've heard from them as a group and enjoying listening to each song over and over again thumbs up panic at the disco.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|I've been a KoRn fan since '94 as a little kid, I've grown up with them, and as a die-hard fan bought every album. They aren't all my favorites but there IS a big difference before and after Head and now with his return, you can honestly feel his return has lifted them to a new level. Musically it's an outstanding album. You must be open minded to know that everything changes, so don't expect KoRn '94 ever again, but its still KoRn screaming with their dark heavy riffs. I DO recomend this to any music fan, and a MUST for a KoRn fan.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This app is really fun! I would definety recommended it it's cool and easy to play so this all is berry cool!
B009NX1YT6|3.0|Movie was great, but kept stopping and starting. One of my favorites, but the brightness was kind of dim and it kept buffering, so I never finished it.<br /><br />Mike
B001XV3LSS|5.0|It was very entertaining and mesmerizing.  A great story and a well written screenplay.  Amazingly concincing acting and special effects
B002QE3CTY|5.0|What a creepy world.... definitely a great read with constant twists and turns. I would recommend to anyone who liked Hunger Games or Divergent.
B00FF56IR4|5.0|So far I like the series and I would recommend it. What I'm having a rough time with is connecting with the characters. There is still a lot of potential and that alone will keep me watching.<br /><br />And for all those that say we are crazy for purchasing the episodes when you can watch them for free this is my response. I prefer to show my support directly to the show by paying to view it without commercials. Regardless of using Amazon or other services I can watch any episode, anywhere, on any of my devices without commercial interruption! Loosing 15 minutes in every hour due to commercials is time I can never get back. So here is my two bucks please keep pushing out more episodes!
B006UUK612|5.0|A movie about a boy who encounters an alien probe,  and wakes up in the future with no memory.  Everyone has aged but not he. A must see for you 80s fans.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|It's one of the best tablet games I've played to date,a must play, the graphics are good and o got really addicted to playing
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|My kids love this movie and so do we really cute fun to see furing halloween time very fun and adam sandler is a great actor.
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|Once you go beyond two screens you and everyone else knows you are suffering from information overload. Our &#34;heroine&#34; here goes far beyond that.  In fact it is very difficult to imagine her doing anything but responding to her flood of input.  In anything remotely resembling real life that would be unsustainable.  I have really enjoyed everything else Mr. Eggers has done but this is an overblown response to a too connected but impersonal world.
B00BMNM4H6|3.0|way more enjoyable that i thought very addictive easy to play no age restrictions any and everyone can play phenomenal game.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|I've written several negative or near-negative reviews lately so it is a real pleasure to be able to write a very positive review for once. I could not put this book down. The other reviews go into great detail about the book, and I hate long-winded reviews, so I will be short...<br /><br />This book has everything...Lindbergh's flight across the Ocean (and subsequent activities), Ruth and Gehrig in a home run race that led to a record season for the Yankees (and a home run record that has never been broken unless you believe in the magic power of the *). Capone. Hoover (both J. Edgar and Herbert). Silent Cal. Mount Rushmore. Bankers ruining the economy. Ponzi scheming. Silent movies giving way to sound movies. And much, much more. All woven together into a story that kept me wanting to start the next chapter before I even finished the previous one.<br /><br />If informal US history interests you as much as it interests me, you will love this book.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As always he held my attention all the way through. Loved it and couldn't put it down. I will look for another Grisham novel to fill the void.
B00DSTBMMU|5.0|Love it love it love it. Makes me want to grab a Bud and listen to it all over again.
B0065RIJ3W|3.0|The book contains alot of information for beginners, but I think it contains a lot of 'bla bla bla', and deviates from the main concerns that the beginners is looking for solutions for them.. still a good book
B00DKY4NBA|5.0|Arctic Monkeys are a great Band! It is interesting to listen a &#34;new&#34; Band on a record. Sounds amazing. Highly recommended.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I ended up purchasing two additional copies (for friends).  This book was a delight, loved Enzo (the books narrator)...though the book takes you on an emotional roller coaster...the ending is perfect*****
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|Must have for Alan fans and bluegrass fans.  Alan does a great job singing these songs and his backup singers and music is fantastic. I listened to all the clips that Amazon offers first before I ordered, but even if I didn't, I have never been disappointed in an Alan Jackson album yet. The very first song \\"Long Hard Road\\" pulled me in.  Great song.  Also \\"Mary\\" the song he wrote for his wife Denise (even thought not named \\"Denise\\") is a typical from the heart Alan Jackson tune with lots of meaning behind it.  I just finished listening to CD for the first time and I totally enjoyed it.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|does what it says it will do and it doesn't without fuss. very easy to use.<br /><br />give it a try, I think you'll be happy with it. :-)
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|My granddaughter was fixated on it right away. Given that she is struggling a bit with her alphabet skills I consider that a good thing and positive comment on the app.
0385334206|4.0|\\"Breakfast of Champions\\". When I first read the title of this book I did not expect a book about breakfast. I was correct, since a \\"Breakfast of champions\\" turned out to be what a random waitress in the story told anyone who ordered a martini. This book is actually the story about a man named Kilgore Trout, a man who wrote science fiction novels was invited to a convention where he meets Dwayne Hoover, a wealthy businessman who is continuously growing more insane every minute. This story includes a few funny segments, many odd mishaps, and a couple interesting thoughts on life, and the creater of the universe.<br /><br />  This book is written in the style of almost a journal, every chapter seperated into 15-30 sub-chapters, and a doodle here and there. The author of this book, Kurt Vonnegut, gets caught up in side thoughts on a regular basis, such as going on and on about the sizes of people in the story, and reading portions of Kilgore Trout's stories. These little extras add on to the story, and they kept me interested.<br /><br />  Overall, I found this novel to be one of the best books I've read recently, and it provided me with knowledge of a different kind of writing than that of which I'm used to.
B008I43DYU|5.0|This calculator has great ease-of-use features.  Example: it keeps track of and displays each step in the calculations as you add, subtract, and multiply or divide so you can combine these and avoid errors along the way.  It makes my life easier!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Good Device. Was easy to install & set up with WiFi connection / router. Great addition to home entertainment. Would recommend.
B0073PPKNM|5.0|One of my favorite artists has delivered yet another CD with excellent sound, tones and music!  I don't care much for the almost bare Melody on the cover or inside the case, but cannot complain about her music.  My 16yr old daughter has listened to her music since she was little and now has also fallen in love with Melody's style.  This CD has a variety of Jazz on it and is enchanting to hear.  Great Great CD!!
B000KIPT30|5.0|I am an audio engineer. I purchased this little preamp to drive my AKG 242 HD headphones with my laptop. When the headphones are plugged straight into the computer the sound is very weak because of the high resistance of the headphones. With this preamp I have plenty of power to juice them up to their maximum thresh hold. Clean sound no buzzing or interference. Good buy for 20 bucks if you wanna add volume or split your signal. I recommend.
B009LDD22U|5.0|movie was good package came on time and no problems.  we love the extra behind the sceens.  go out and buy it!
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|Love this game. Very cool. Game play is great. I really enjoy the scenery and the graphics are pretty good also.
1609611543|4.0|Davis makes such sense.  I've been almost wheat free for 20 years because of MS, but found Davis had a lot of new information. Being wheat free hasn't cured me, but neither am I any worse. My first thought after reading this book was, if wheat were such a poison, no one would be healthy.  Then I got to thinking about people I know.  No one IS healthy. Arthritis, high cholesterol, blood sugar, Alzheimer's, cancer, osteoporosis, asthma, allergies, dental problems, heart attacks, not to mention death! Is it too much to expect anyone in my age group (60's) to be perfectly healthy?  Perhaps not if wheat is the culprit.  Maybe some people can eat wheat and remain healthy. Check out Dr Mercola and his eat right for your body type plan.  I know I'm better without it.  I'm appalled  though that Davis has a recipe using a microwave.  Most people interested in good health gave up microwaves long ago.  And it's asking too much for me to give up beans and legumes.  I'll keep eating those, and raw milk as well.  But persist with the no wheat.  As he suggests, no need to count calories.  And there's a lot to be said for the yummy satisfaction in a high fat diet.
B008COPZ60|5.0|I had lost my original cd so I decided to go on here and purchase the deluxe edition with the extra dvd because as a firm belieber you can never have to much bieber!!!! When I opened my package I checked to make sure I had all the discs and I was stoked to find out there was an extra copy of the believe album so in total I got 3 discs!!!! couldn't be happier!!
B0019O6IWU|5.0|I had no idea how often my communication was ineffective.  This book is helping me realize how I interact with people currently and how I want to interact.  It takes dedication and hard work to interrupt the habitual patterns we have taken a lifetime to develop, and this book is one of the many ways that shine awareness on those patterns in order for change to be possible.  It is simple, straightforward, and incredibly helpful.  I recommend this book for anyone - parents and children, lovers, co-workers, etc.
B00E0G5U4G|5.0|Seems like they found their second youth. Amazing album. In the classic style of Carcass. What a drive, great lyrics...
B009GX6SSK|5.0|Great stories! Kensi & Deeks are hilarious and cute! Really enjoy all of the cast. Didn't appreciate it fully when it first came out because I was such a huge fan of NCIS but now can't get enough - keep 'em coming!
0618918248|5.0|I was raised as a Christian, but in my teenage years began to question some strange things, and by age 20 began to part from the faith. When you do this, you risk losing a lot of friends, you make family very angry, if you tell people what you believe they get upset and think you are possessed by Satan. It's called Reason, folks, not Satan. The God Delusion is an apt title by one of the world's prominent athiests and a brilliant man who makes a solid case that belief in invisible beings is one of the most destructive things ever created by the mind of man.<br /><br />No one changes their religious views during an argument. It takes questioning, and quiet, personal reflection over time. Once you begin to really question, and your mind opens to accept the answers and their implications, religion crumbles. I recommend this book very highly. It's well written, but easy to understand.
B00F52YOPA|1.0|The app on the carousel is a grey square. Each time I have tried to use it, the game freezes in the 3rd or 4th screen. Do not waste your money
1250038820|5.0|Humans of New York doesn't just restore people's faith in humanity.  It reminds us that humanity exists beyond our facebook feed and the melodramatic news we get fed every day.  In a place like New York, where everyone is crammed into the same hot, stinky subway car, it is hard to see each other as humans.  Brandon peels away the barriers, and makes us look into our fellow humans eyes, hearts, and souls.  Strangers are not so strange when we share the same struggles with what to do with our lives and how to be happy.  This book from a design perspective is GORGEOUS (and I'm a Creative Director), with clean page layouts, no clutter, and interesting typography. It FEELS great. I have already laughed and cried and I'm only on page 25.  I did not have any expectations, really just thought it would be similar to the blog/facebook posts, but I am blown away.  This is not a \\"coffee table book,\\"  this is a masterpiece of creativity and humanity.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush Saga has re-opened the door to yelling \\"Sweet!\\" about things I find totally radical. \\"Sweet!\\" has been outdated since the late '90's, but now that everybody can play this game, maybe it'll be gnarly and not lame to let loose a \\"Sweet!\\" or \\"Awesome!\\" just like the Candy god.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|Brilliant, disturbing, incredibly imaginative, terrifying, incisive, authentic, wild, and impossible to put down. Made me want to learn how to camp and eat wild plants at 14,000 feet on an unchartered mountain. Or at least turn off my iPhone iPad computer and wifi for a minute...
B000002KE2|5.0|This, along with there other early albums is just great R&R. And for anyone not familiar with them, despite the name of the group, no way is this music anything near demonic.
B000AMPZF8|5.0|The only reason i bought this on Amazon is because i had a birthday gift card and my copy was so scratched up i couldn't even listen to it. Amazon does sell this at the same price as Best Buy with the prime free shipping when you buy $25 so it was a no brainer for me although you can buy the cd from other sellers at lower prices they usually charge for shipping and the Amazon price was not bad at all! I love all the artwork included in this album and how it ties into the title! MUSE is my favorite band! Origin of Symmetry is a must have although I am working on getting the rest of their albums and if you are thinking about getting this cd, you can't go wrong. They have quite a mixture of different sounds and i absolutely hate to put a label on music, seriously why do we do that?? Matt Bellamy is a freaking genius and i am in awe of all the work he has put into making MUSE what it is today although all its members make it what it is, of course! and also am a big fan of their newer album (my latest obsession) \\"The Resistance\\"!
B0010HA68I|4.0|I went to Machu Picchu over the summer, and bought these to secure my binoculars to my backpack straps.  I just used a daypack with the two thick draw-strings to close it.  The clamps held tight on the thick drawstrings.<br /><br />Pros<br />These straps are easy to install, and very convenient.  They kept my binoculars from swinging around much while I hiked --important on the steep and rocky trails where you really have to watch your step.  Having the binoculars attached to my backpack straps avoided putting pressure on the back of my neck-- important because I tend to get headaches if my neck muscles are tight.  Additionally, the binoculars were handy to grab the instant I noticed something interesting-- no fumbling with a case or trying to pull them out of my pack while the wildlife escapes from view.  I could also easily share my binoculars with friends by undoing the squeeze-clips.<br /><br />Cons (all minor)<br />I did have to take at least one squeeze-clip off to get in and out of the backpack setup, so if you plan to be getting in and out of your backpack frequently, this may be annoying.  The clamps that hook the straps onto the backpack sometimes dug into my chest if they were sitting at the wrong angle-- this was a bit uncomfortable.  Also, if your binoculars are not light-weight you will feel them pulling down, especially if your backpack isn't heavy.  On a fashion note, my travel companions teased me for wearing my binoculars so often-- they called me \\"Dora the Explorer\\"!  Yet I noticed that they were always eager to borrow the binoculars whenever something interesting was found.  Without these straps I certainly wouldn't have worn my binoculars as much, and thus have looked a bit more fashionable.  But I'm glad I did-- Machu Picchu is probably going to be once-in-a-lifetime for me, and looking a bit nerdy was worth having the ability to quickly get a closer look at all the amazing sights.<br /><br />Overall, I'm glad I had these.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Sing for Absolution,this cd is AWESOME! MUSE is so talented and creative and every one of their cds are unique. Matt Belamy has an amazing voice. I love every single song on this album. For a band made of only 3 members, what they come up with is pretty amazing. They all have such an impressive and may i say daring way of playing different instruments/doing vocals. Matt Bellamy is the lyrical music think tank/genius if you will behind the band but they complement each other musically and one man cannot do it all! I love the complex range of emotion this cd brings out and the composition is breathtaking! A happy find on Amazon which had the prime free shipping when you buy $25. I always take advantage of that.
B00FDSUJ0A|5.0|This is the first album of theirs that I own and even though I listen to them on youtube all the time and LOVE their music I finally bought an album and LOVE IT!  GET IT!
031623480X|1.0|All nutrition books written by US-trained medical doctors should be presumed to be complete nonsense until proven otherwise. That's because US medical schools teach practically nothing about clinical nutrition and surprisingly little about epidemiology. If you study clinical nutrition, you will quickly realize that high-carb, low-fat diets promote weight loss and reverse the insulin resistance that is the real problem in type 2 diabetes. That fact has been obvious since the 1930s. If you study nutritional epidemiology, you will find a practically straight-line relationship between fat consumption and Alzheimer disease. The more fat a population eats, the higher its age-adjusted risk of Alzheimer disease. Societies that eat a lot of cereal grains have low rates of Alzheimer disease. That fact has been known at least since the mid 1980s. If you take Dr. Perlmutter's advice and eat more fat and less carbohydrate, you will increase your risk of type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer disease. Of course, if you have celiac disease or some other form of wheat intolerance, you should avoid wheat, rye, and barley. Yet that does not mean that you should avoid other cereal grains or starches in general.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|What can be said that hasn't already been said about one of classic movies greatest stories ever? If you have never seen it,  do. If you have seen it, watch it again and again because every time is just as the first.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Superb acting by the entire cast, not just Danes and Lewis, incredible plot(s) -- a phenomenal show!  Will hope it continues a lot longer.
B00F880BWG|5.0|Convenient and is amazon a couple hours after the show airs.  Good pricing and worth the HD. Amazon will be my go to for watching the shows I miss!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I love the restraint and regality that Mrs. Florrick embodies. She portrays someone with incredible willpower and drive. She's a great role model for future women who would pursue political or legal careers.
B00A9ET4MC|2.0|As other readers already noticed, this book has 200 pages too much. The 'Ifemelu as a successful blogger in America' section is far overstretched. Pity, because it could have been a great book, with the right dose of drama and humour, an interesting angle on race issues, a likeable main character and an excellent opening, which was why I bought it in the first place (the brilliant hair salon scene, which runs as a thread all along the book). It kept me interested until Ifemelu starts having rich boyfriends and her life becomes a sequence of easy successes and sophisticated conversations. At that point it collapses: the boyfriends, especially Blaine, are artificial and contrived, the side characters don't have any depth and ok there is still racism in America and yes in Africa is different but how many times do you need to repeat it? it's a novel not a lecture. The blog posts by themsleves would have been enough to make the points she wanted to make about race in America and made a much more pleasant read. So you keep going (skimming in my case), waiting with increasing impatience for Ifemelu to take that plane back to Lagos and get done with it ( as announced since page 1). Unfortunately the part in Lagos is also an anti-climax: apart from a few humorous observations on Nigeria today, there is just the question, will he leave is wife or not? The whole section is not much deeper than any romance novel.<br />A last element  which put me off: race attitudes in America are dissected and stygmatized very effectively, but I ended the book with a feeling that corruption and political disfunction in Nigeria get away relatively lightly in Ifemelu's Nigerian blog. And no judgement is passed on Obinze's way of getting his money - yeah he feels a bit uneasy about it, but he remains a nice guy and Ifemelu still loves him. I know this is not the point of the book, and the author has written about Nigeria's tragedies elsewhere, but there is something unfair about the way she presents the issues - but maybe it's just an impression of a white European female who has never been confronted with any of the issues at stake.<br />So if you want to read this author and learn something about Nigeria's history, read Half of a Yellow Sun, by far a better and deeper book.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Can't update, directs you to Google play where won't recognize the kindle for updating.....Updating Now!good app when it works right, lol. Very handy to have Facebook on my kindle.
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|The game is fun, but I hate having to pay for extras. On all of the games you should just be rewarded on your skill and given extra moves or something.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|As an international flight attendant, i sometimes am in a country where the tv viewing is not very good or even in english. That is<br />why I have downloaded Asylum to my Kindle Fire HD, the entire season, along w/season 1. That way I have something to<br />watch which I absolutely love, could watch these episodes over & over!
B000JLQSW4|5.0|Great cd....loved the music. Would like to purchase more of their cd s in the future and probably will someday.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great series. It kept my interest throughout. The writing was top notch, I will watch this series until the end.
B000001FN3|4.0|Good cd....very interesting with the poem stuff...enjoyed it though. My girlfriend really enjoyed the cd.  Worth checking it out if you can.

B00B99KJR0|1.0|Can someone tell me how to play this game? Just give me the info I need to refer to I would greatly appreciate it
B00CDY6HW6|3.0|My biggest pet peeve with this game is at some points you have to be MINUTELY exact in where you click on a bunny to start a specific task. Two or three seconds too far left or right and you end up having to start the entire level over and over again. This was fun at first then it became a chore and felt more like work than gaming.
B009P5K4HK|1.0|Amy's music is far from my taste. Waist of  money...Another overinflated star. A very good voice but she did  not use it for better level songs. The reviews induced me in error.
B009AY04A8|2.0|Wait? What? I get to the end of the game and it's not the end of the game? There'll be more episodes you'll need to buy (I expect) to find out what finally happens.<br /><br />Too much dialog, it's really just a hidden object game with a boring and incessantly annoying story line tacked on.
B0061JPYX2|1.0|Amy's music is far from my taste. Waist of  money...Another overinflated star. A very good voice but she did  not use it for better level songs. The reviews induced me in error.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun Fun Fun! Keeps the children busy. Adults too. Really great game for children. Hand and Eye coordination. Worth buying.
B001XUPH9K|5.0|... and watch the real deal instead. Wrath of Khan has a plausable plot. Characters that you can empathise with. And, Ricardo Montalban.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It is ok. Too many mandatory changes. Too exposed to others. No respect to user's privacy. To facebook it about their pockets not the value of it's product or it's users.
B008EL25LE|4.0|Azkend 2 has Amazing 3D Graphics with many Colorful items in octagonal tiles that you can touch or swipe to Match 3 or more. The tiles then break and the selected items disappear and allow items above to drop down. Object is to break as many octogons in 1 swipe as you can.  Try to lower a Unique Item from top to bottom until it drops out and you win the level. You also break tiles near FOGGY Areas, etc. along parts of the board.  Latter levels add more Variables and increased difficulty to keep you Engaged. Achievements are awarded for selecting larger numbers of tiles with one swipe, cool Lightning and Explosions knock out more tiles, etc. The Sound Effects, Music and Visual Effects are all Pleasant and Enjoyable.<br /><br />Overall, a Fun and Satisfying game that was well thought out and Nicely designed with player in mind. It is based on AZKEND 1 style but has manh Good Differences so Azkend 1 players will like it without getting bored.  Sadly, it has smaller Graphics (even on 10\\" Tablets) so it might be hard to play on Phone devices.  I see no option to change graphics resolution so we are stuck with the smaller graphics.  Gameplay is easy, Timer is forgiving and you can earn more time with good combination plays. The Storyline is Nice but does not have to be followed to play game properly. Good Instructions, Options and Controls make it a well Polished App. Safe Permissions and No Annoyances. Thankfully, you can play with WiFi off also.  An Enjoyable game with Moderate challenges that make it a definite KEEPER!
B00B7Y0206|3.0|This app is okay at first but then all of a sudden it freezes but after a long time. Occasionally it will just say: vtube app not available and just leave my screen. The part that aggravated me is that the music also keep playing that you had on and you have to restart the hole device you were on to stop the videos noises. It's very good besides those three obstacles. So you choose to buy or not buy the app.  &lt;3
0307271609|5.0|I have previously read a fictional account of the life of Empress Cixi in Pearl Buck's [[ASIN:1559210354 Imperial Woman]], which I quite enjoyed, but I have wan'ted to know more about this woman and how she rose to power.  This biography is fascinating; Jung Chang is a natural storyteller, and her words help rehabilitate the Empress past her Western reputation as an aged dragon upon the throne.  I mean, she doesn't transform Cixi into a benevolent, enlightened, democratic ruler - nothing crazy like that! - Chang simply provides much of the context that explains how Cixi's worldview was formed and why she made many of the choices that she did.
B00D2PIUAM|3.0|Upon hearing that Placebo was making another album, I became incredibly excited. Unfortunately, the day the album was release, that excitement dwindled. I'll admit, there are certainly a few \\"good\\" tracks on the album (Purify, LLL, Begin the End, Scene of the Crime). Usually, I find Brian Molko's lyrics to be extremely clever and creative, but it isn't the case on this album. To me, all the people claiming they are so \\"exposed\\" lyrically with this album are equating vulnerability with quality. \\"Bosco,\\" \\"Rob the Bank,\\" \\"Too many friends,\\" and even \\"Loud Like Love\\" could have been written by a 15 year old. Placebo is one of my top 3 musical acts of all time. I've honestly loved every single album they've put out, excluding this one. Musically, they are evolving, and for a band that's been around as long as they have, I completely understand that need. Up until this point, I honestly believed they were evolving in the right direction.  I will still see them on tour as soon as they arrange a full scale U.S. tour. However, that 8 year wait will now force to listen to almost all of this album, which is a complete bummer.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This game is really amazing! It is several hours long, the story is absolutely amazing, and the gameplay is fun. The characters are great and the voice acting is excellent. It is really fun to live out the characters life day by day for about a year. If you have a Vita you must get this game.
B00A0SICYI|5.0|Wonderful family movie classic! Brought back great memories for us as parents and captivated the kids.  Recommended if you are looking for a clean, entertaining movie appropriate for all ages.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I chose this rating because I purchased my kindle fire to play games on my face book account, and it says the games are unavailable. Also I was unable to find the king.com games for download on the app store. So its back to the desktop for me.
B0078XGEK2|5.0|Teaches you about how to handle problems that befall each persons life. It is filled with common sense, self-value and love. We sometimes forget that each of us has great value and the tools of self-discipline that help us deal with the pain brought by problems.
B00BRUPICM|5.0|Immediately went back to Amazon for more Pierre Lemaitre after finishing this book. Disappointed to find that apparently this is the only work available in English right now. The story is excellent--fascinating protagonist is a tiny little lawman with a complex approach to life and work. I skipped a couple of the more graphic sections, which were sadistic and gratuitous. But overall the characters and plot are engrossing. BTW, I was impressed with the quality of the translation. So well done you'd think the original was in English, but without losing the very French point of view.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Surprisingly good. I read in 2 marathon sessions.<br />I did not give 5 stars because the ending was disappointing. Left a little to be desired. But, all in all, a very good book.
B001EC2IT4|4.0|Great for family movie night.  Especially around halloween.  This flick will become a cult classic.  You can watch it over and over again.
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|loved the first one the day it came out. I've been waiting for years for next one, this one is great.
B00ET9T2WK|5.0|This is the best game!! It is fun and well done.. You can transfer your account from one device to another and keep playing, even between Android and IOS devices.. Totally recommend..
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|I dislike it.  I'm not sure if it is a part of Google CHROME but I suspect it is.  I am very angry that my traditional igoogle is being ENDED and I'm being forced to go to Google CHROME.  I downloaded it and tried it.  I will be removing the program from my computer and going to another search engine.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am in love i cried but you know what i font care it was still the best omg im gonna die
B00555X8OA|3.0|Great information. Changed the way I think about thinking. I've already applied my knowledge numerous times when anticipating how and why a person might misunderstand a point I'm making or how I might misunderstand a point they're making. Unfortunately for me, a slow reader, many chapters are subtle variants of the information in the previous chapter. I wish the delivery were more concise.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Reasonable plot structure that parodies a Greek tragedy and is<br /> quickly developed with a minimal number of characters.<br /><br />An easy read.
B008YRVW0I|3.0|I love this game, I would give the game a 5 Stars.... however it says it is free at the app store. After playing a short while it wants  you to pay 4.99 for it, it locks you out and won't let you continue unless you purchase it. That my friend is rubish....I think I will delete it, what a shame!
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|I like playing games that challenge my brain or just distract it from other thoughts. This one does neither one.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love how they talk. Fun fun fun show to watch and learn the dynamics of how these types of British households were managed and the relationships between the help and owners is wonderful. Simply can't get enough of this show.
B0063IH60K|1.0|I can't afford to buy the coins needed to play these games. Still looking for games that are really free.
B004UA8D2S|4.0|Great - Shows dramatic underwater photography, Australian movie so its grounded and simlly down to earth ( Not a Holywwood prodcution!)
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love this version so much! Great graphics and bright colors keep things interesting. I can play for hours and I can't say that for other versions. All this and its FREE!
0375507256|4.0|A classic book that has only now been marked as a book-to-movie!! A hard to read book, but very interesting.<br /><br />It's actually kind of complex and I am not very sure how to explain this book. So I looked it up for you:<br /><br />&#34;Structured rather akin to a Chinese puzzle or a set of Matrioshka dolls, there are dazzling shifts in genre and voice and the stories leak into each other with incidents and people being passed on like batons in a relay race. The 19th-century journals of an American notary in the Pacific that open the novel are subsequently unearthed 80 years later on by Frobisher in the library of the ageing, syphilitic maestro he's trying to fleece. Frobisher's waspish letters to his old Cambridge crony, Rufus Sexsmith, in turn surface when Rufus, is murdered. A novelistic account of the journalist Luisa Rey's investigation into Rufus' death finds its way to Timothy Cavendish, a London vanity publisher with an author who has an ingenious method of silencing a snide reviewer. And in a near-dystopian Blade Runner-esque future, a genetically engineered fast food waitress sees a movie based on Cavendish's unfortunate internment in a Hull retirement home. All this is less tricky than it sounds, only the lone &#34;Zachary&#34; chapter, told in Pacific Islander dialect is an exercise in style too far. Not all the threads quite connect but nonetheless Mitchell binds them into a quite spellbinding rumination on human nature, power, oppression, race, colonialism and consumerism&#34;
B003B02O0A|5.0|Tautly written, the writing grabs hold of your throat, and your heart, and doesn't relax it's grip until the final sentence. Masterful. Profoundly rich in detail, the reader is beside Jake for the entire ride. I couldn't put it down, dreamed about it at night, was thoroughly engrossed and richly paid for my interest. Grisham is the Best.
0345522478|5.0|You walk into an occult bookshop.<br /><br />You see a young man working there and the first thing you think of is he must be here working for his folks or family members trying to save money for school. Girls will just think he's a cute boy and maybe see him in school sometime. He wouldn't harm a fly, and he's a nice innocent boy.<br /><br />Of course you would think this mostly because your human and you believe everything you see.<br /><br />But you don't see that the iron bars on the windows are not just for hoodlums but also Fairy hoodlums; or that the boy is not really a boy and can fight ten men at once and can hold his own. Of course if an evil warlord was after him your would think he would run and hide....think again!!
B007SY3CEW|3.0|The sound doesn't always work! I thought it was my device but other apps have sound so I don't know what's going on???
B00F91RYL8|1.0|Disappointed that Brad Pitt movie would be such a low calibre. Felt like a low budget movie production. Lost interest in the first 15 minutes.
B008JFUQZ2|4.0|I'm going to start by calling this movie what it clearly is: an \\"instant cult\\" film. What it has going for it are a simple but compelling story line, excellent effects and reasonably good overall production values, and a family-friendly tone that offers a deeper themes of grief, teamwork and loyalty without slowing down the story.  I, for one, like this film very much, but I write this review in part to take other \\"fans\\" to task for the negative comments being attached to critical reviews.  A film like this is, inevitably, not going to appeal to everyone, and if it doesn't \\"click\\" with some people, they are entitled to say so.
B001CDZZI6|5.0|The test was simple and meant to answered quickly.  I felt the results were very accurately described my personality and the detailed descriptions of each attribute were so helpful.  If I were an employer I would use this as part of the interview process.
B0068THAGY|4.0|Fun movie for a light movie night.. I can poke several holes in the story but it's well executed. Enjoy :)
B00EMAGCJM|1.0|Garbage CD. I actually use to enjoy Hannah Montana and the good ol Miley, but this is just street trash. Don't listen or else you might get Hepatitis B
B003FXCSNQ|3.0|The dystopian world in Blade Runner is so visual that I found it hard to get into this book. There is not that much description of the badly depleted planet earth where some humans have chosen to linger despite the enticements of Mars. Dick portrays the planet as cloaked in dust from a nuclear fallout and filled with the decaying remnants of past inhabitants lives. People travel around in hovercars and have electric pets but I didn't get a strong sense of the futuristic sci-fi world of Blade Runner through the writing.<br /><br />Approaching the book with preconceived ideas didn't do me any favours. This was never a page turner for me and some of it was kind of tedious (I'm not a big sci-fi fan), but it was still a very interesting read, especially the major theme of the book which is what does it mean to be human? Dick doesn't offer any easy answers to the questions he raises. For example what are we supposed to make of the fact that humanity worships animals because they have become almost extinct, and yet so easily kill sentient beings that are far more intelligent than sheep and goats?<br /><br />There is a lot here that is so relevant to the modern world where technology becomes more pervasive every day. A sci-fi classic that will make you think. 3.5 stars.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Learn a language and help translate webpages<br />No complaints just wish it had more languages<br />Overall Great App ! !
B00821OX98|5.0|all the buzz i have heard about this, so i decided to watch. it was as good as they say.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|I loved this book which is a true LeCarre page-turner.  The ending just a wee bit ambiguous for my tastes, though.
B00EY7LT9Q|3.0|I was curious about this new program, as I am a big fan of the Marvel movies.  So, this was fun to take a peek at the new show.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|THIS IS AWESOME. I HOPE THAT MORE WEBSITES WILL BE AVAILABLE IN CANADA TO USE IT.<br />ALSO A MORE USER FRIENDLY SOFTWARE TO ALLOW THE PLAYING OF STORED MOVIES
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Yes this is really good and easy if your computer literate not like us just learning but finding this a useful edition on Kindle very easy and helpful
B0098NSCSM|4.0|An interesting look at the effects of grief, loss, and death on the human psyche. The film follows for friends and how they deal with these things. The slow pace of the movie is countered by the sheer emotional range of the characters. There isn't much character development. The picture quality is poor, but the shots are well composed and add to the emotional effect of the movie. The film asks not for a deconstruction of the plot, but an internal analysis of how the plot affects the characters. A heartfelt slice of life movie.
1250038820|5.0|I have been following Brandon on Facebook for a long time. Ordered two of these books (one for me, one for a gift) and was not disappointed. Every picture provokes a different emotion. I highly recommend HONY for anyone nterested in a glimpse below the superficial surface of the people you pass in the street every day.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Very fun game would not mind if there was more ways to get funds for items needed in the special puzzles instead of spending money
0062197266|3.0|Starts out very slowly and humdrum. I skipped a lot of the 2007 and 2008 chapters until about 3/4 of the way through.  I could not bear to re-read about the checking and the circuitous routes home.  It is pretty obvious what is going on and a lot of this jabber could have been left out of the book.<br /><br />Lee was quite the formidable foe and a seriously disturbed human being. I will admit they pulled a real \\"gotcha\\" on me with the trip to New York fiasco.  I was rooting for her to get away. The Sylvia twist was kind of interesting also.<br /><br />All in all, it was not as bad as I first thought and I am glad I stuck with it.  Mo Hayder, another English writer in the same type of gruesome genre is a bit better.
0545128285|4.0|Cute short stories from Potter world...one of which can be found in Deathly Hallows, but no Potter fan would want to be without it. More like a kids bed time story book and it really doesn't have anything to do with main story you know and love...but if you are a fan you will buy it.
B001YV5068|5.0|Both the plot and concept of this movie was superb and the acting by all was fantastic the whole idea of this bank robery is conceivable correct.
B009RX85N0|5.0|Love it or hate it but it's an interesting show you got to admit. Yeah it not &#34;Lost&#34; but it is a pretty good show. It adds new characters this season and builds on favorites for deeper story lines. It's worth a buy if your a fan, but if you are just testing the waters might want to check out first season.
B00DW5IM9Q|1.0|Paid way too much for this.  I don't like most of the music. I suppose you would like it if you are a big Bob Dylan fan. If so, I'd be happy to send you mine and a very reduced price.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very good app and a lot of fun. Keeps anyone entertained. Great visuals too. I love this game very much :)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Well seeing as I am a basset I would prefer that the dog in the series be a basset and not that big happy yellow thing Isis. And no I don't count beagles or fox hounds in the hunting scenes. I root for the foxes. The Mr and Mrs enjoyed the whole series even though they had watched the thing on PBS. Why they are watching again beats me. They watched it on that Roku thing.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|I had a lot of fun with this build, and all the options it has to match the three different Back to the Future movies are great. I only wish the doors were more sturdy but that is just how it was designed due to the limitations of the medium.
B00AEFYNN6|4.0|This is a nice picture put together with some very talented actors, like Harrison ford, playing the host of a morning show<br />hired by Rachel to do, as of one of the main co-host along with Diane Keaton, a great actress and academy award winner.<br />Rachel plays the producer of a show that according to the ratings, is about to be pull off the air by the station, but Rachel insists, she could hire and make the show successful as their producer. is a good 2 hours of  watching these actors bickering with each other, throwing shots at each other, but eventually all becoming a big nice happy family!. Now about Rachel, I love her to death, so I may be a bit bias with this review, Lol.
B004YXE438|5.0|I could play this day and night, it's an amazingly addictive app! It's well done, the pictures are great, and I love the ability to tailor it to how hard I want it to be. The only thing I would change is to allow us to NOT have the squares rotate, I'd like to play it without the pieces rotating. But that doesn't change how much fun it is. It's perfect for playing during commercials, in the car, or in bed to unwind. I highly recommend it!!
B004BSWC8A|4.0|Here is a film with Kevin Bacon, playing the bad guy again, which he's very good at it and the best actress of the century Meryl Streep. Well, she's trying to reconcile her marriage which is not going very well, so she got the gang together to go river rafting near her old parts of the woods, where she once worked as well, but hubby too busy working saying can't make it, but eventually finds the time to come as long as he can continue his job from his laptop. They hear in the news some bank robbery going on and police looking for 3 suspects and of course I think you can almost guess what and who is part of that act and then the film follows with a hostage situation from which Meryl's family tries to get out of and save their lives with the help of her husband whom finally realizes how important family is!. One of Meryl's earlier films but still entertaining.
B00BMKH5NW|4.0|I started reading this book partly because of the rave reviews I heard of Rainbow Rowell's other book, Eleanor And Park, which has long been on my To-Read list. The other, more pressing reason, though, was because it was tumblr's inaugural selection for their book club, and I was curious as to how the entire enterprise would pan out. The tumblr book club has been doing pretty well, tbh, and I'm glad, because Fangirl was definitely worth reading.<br /><br />I won't go into too much depth, but I will say that my favorite character was Reagan, who was all kinds of awesome. I also felt that the emotional conflicts were authentic and, too often, ignored in a lot of mainstream (adult?) publishing. From Cath's resistance to change, to Nick's betrayal, to Laura's idea of motherhood, this book didn't offer any pat, feel-good conclusions, but gave us realistic outcomes that weren't necessarily downers. A book about, ostensibly, a girl wrapped up in writing fanfiction (and I'll admit that I've been there myself) turned out to be a surprisingly moving examination of the perils of modern young adulthood.<br /><br />The main reason I didn't give the book 5 stars was that I thought it was unfair not to tell us what happened to Baz and Simon, in either Gemma's or, preferably, Cath's version. That might not sound like a big deal to someone who hasn't read the book but, to me, as a person who's written and read fanfic, it was a cruel oversight. Otherwise, a very satisfying novel.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|Liked this much better than the first Star Wars. Would like to have instructions so I know what all the different things mean in this game.
B00F880BWG|4.0|Just like any other Walking Dead episode, I really loved the writing. They did a very great job with drawing me into the episode, and make me feel as if I was really there. I also loved how they surprized me with new relationships that had formed within the group during the time gap.  My favorite scene was the conversation Daryl and Beth had, because they really haven't had much dialog in the show up to this point.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it didnt have much action, except the &#34;Big Spot&#34; scene, but thats ok, because I am sure there is plenty of action coming my way.<br />P.S. IF DARYL DIES, WE RIOT!!!
1451695187|5.0|I have given copies of this book as gifts. It is a select audience I give it to, but it is always well received.
B0038LB4TE|5.0|You can really get into this book and I have not wanted to put the book down but my eyes would not stay open on some nights.  Very suspenseful and a great storyline. Worth the money again
B001NLL93W|5.0|I'm really enjoying this series I like the world and culture the author has created and she gives a new twist to the teen romance.
B00F56AZK4|3.0|I enjoy the puzzles, but wish more were offered on a free basis or at a cost under a dollar.
B000T06172|5.0|What else needs to be said about &#34;Pet Sounds?&#34;  When Paul McCartney is quoted as saying it was part of the inspiration for Sgt Pepper, you probably should check it out.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's fun and entertaining for the whole family. Highly recommend this to anyone. I love it and so does my grandson.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I tried to connect this to my HD television and it would not do so.  I went to the Google website and their instructions were impossible to follow.  The advance word was that his item was easy to use and that proved to be a totally false statement.  This is the first time I had to return an item due to its failure to live up to its promise.  In the future Amazon should first test its new products before offering them for sale.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was such a heartfelt and touching book, i had no choice but to love it! This was such an actually look into reality that i cried a little. I definitely recommend reading this book
0670451495|5.0|This book arrived early and also in good condition. I loved the illustrations of the Boston area where the story takes place. I have read to my granddaughter who loved the story.
B00FPH6A70|5.0|Movie had me on edge and I like that! It is a must see. Since it is a true story it makes it that more creepier!
B009NY43NY|3.0|A bit disappointed on Sookie's last tale. Her character seemed a bit more down- homey than usual, the reason why everyone is after her seems an afterthought and doesn't quite make sense and I don't like the direction her life is headed - too predictable and neat. Overall, it was an ok read. Not too exciting.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy I've been waiting for this game and it does not disappoint. my whole family will have a blast  playing. Now can't wait for pet saga.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Good story with a slow start.  I  liked the two different time periods weaving the story connecting characters in both times.
B008EL25LE|5.0|Amazon been getting crappy lately on the FAOTD....but this game made up for it do far. it's a great game to past the time away..I see the price 4.99 it's not worth it..so grab it fast today while it's free
1476734941|1.0|Excellent way to lose weight. Better than loosen weight is I lost my inflammation in my hips. I only do one day per week and still get the anti aging benefit. Great book I thing everyone should read it.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|I absolutely love love love this app and I beat the game already.. sad about that!! But I am going through and getting all three apples on the levels...!! Wish there was a second one!!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Performance is exactly what you get with this app,  Only alarm I use-  Great to travel with because it is on my Kindle Fire!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is simply amazing. They don't offer you credits to write reviews but I wanted to write one anyways so people can know how awesome this game is. I literally have no complaints! Excellent graphics, excellent weapons, excellent gameplay and excellent variety. One last thing, this game doesn't push you to buy credits all the time. You can actually play for a while without spending real money. Zero ads. Again, this game is amazing!
B0001ARCFA|5.0|These headphones are great. The cans are large enough to fit around your ear and the headband fits real nicely. Every layer of sound that comes through is crisp and vivid. It's obviously not the best pair of headphones that you can find, but I personally think that these AKG K 240s are the best pair of headphones in their price range. And that opinions coming after having pairs of Sony, Sennheiser, and Panasonic phones from around the same price.
B00F880BWG|5.0|I love the show. The quality is good as well as the audio. Plus watching without commercials is even better.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I really loved this book.  It was so interesting, but some of it was distressing to hear how slaves were treated.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|They knocked this one out of the park.  It was a snap to install.  It hooked into my wireless network easily -- something some other streaming devices still struggle with -- and the integration with the other devices in my house (from laptops to Android phones) was immediate and seamless.  I mean that, really.  We got it in, and suddenly both my phone and my wife's were able to send YouTube videos to the TV, and it even managed the conflict between the two of us by establishing a &#34;Stream to TV&#34; Queue.<br /><br />It used to be that the &#34;Watch it Later&#34; button on YouTube was a way for me to express interest in a video but tacitly acknowledge that I was never going to take the time to watch it.  There are better things to do at my desktop.  But chilling out in the bedroom.  Sure, I'll queue up half a dozen little videos and catch up every few days.<br /><br />So yeah, this one worked so well that it was practically indistinguishable from magic.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game. It was recommend to me by my mother, because she knows how much I like dragons. She was right. This game is the best.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|This is one of my favorite SF series of all time.  I know some people rag on the ending, but I thought it was perfect.  I had been buying the DVDs as they came out, but it's nice to finally have it in hi-def BluRay.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I would recommend playing this highly addictive repetitive game to any body who enjoys a simple challenge while wasting time.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|Enjoyable characters.<br /><br />Nice show - good option from so many violent shows on TV.  Recommend to watch, look forward to following seasons.
B003274QH6|5.0|Its awesome. Can't go wrong with this product. It's a great show. I will order more of this product in rhe near future.
B00DXP0QV2|5.0|This album originally came out when I was 15. To me, it weeded out the \\"posers\\" from the real fans. The friends who were real fans got it. Those who weren't, thought it was crap.<br /><br />Songs from it have been on my mixed tapes, mixed cds, playlists, etc. for years now. It will probably be the album, along with anything Tegan and Sara have put out, along with Alanis's Jagged Little Pill, that my kids, nieces and nephews will grow up listening to. It's \\"modern\\" music at its finest.<br /><br />And for whoever said \\"Dumb\\" is depressing - listen to it again... it's Kurt's love song. It's one of the sweetest I've ever heard. I'm not the only one to think this - I believe he mentioned it in an interview somewhere. :)
B00A8ECU24|3.0|This game is going to let me know what does not. I know I have to finish the wanted songs.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It works flawlessly. I did notice a slight hesitation with Netflix to register the cast to from any device to the TV but I guess patience is a virtue and it works the second time. It literally is plug n play so the setup is quick and painless. You might  have a problem with the limitation of using Chrome browser but I generally use it anyway. Well worth the money to me as it literally allows a TV to project any website that you are viewing.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It was great! A definite must read!! I'm counting down the days until the movie. Getting all my friends to read it now!
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I actually had started the process with Amazon to return the ATR-3350. I then thought that I would try a little test running the mic through my PC's mic input and found that the problem wasn't with the mic but with my setup. I looked for a way to cancel the return but I guess by not physically returning the mic Amazon will get the message.<br /><br />I wanted to run the ATR-3350 mic through my PA mixer. I tried using a 3.5mm to 1/4\\" stereo plug adapter to connect TRS input of the mixer, but the mixer did not recognize it as a mic signal. The mixer assumes that anything coming in through the TRS input is a line-level signal. But I didn't understand that until I contacted Audio-Technica's user support. They explained the mixer problem and suggested that I run through an adapter that would let me run the mic through the mixer's XLR input instead to  make the mixer \\"believe\\" that it was really a mic.<br /><br />I have finally gotten all of the parts that I needed to run the ATR-3350 through my PA mixer (note that I got all of these parts through Amazon). There are 2 adapters between the ATR-3350 and the mixer. I have the ATR-3350 connected to a Hosa GPM-179 adapter, which converts from 3.5mm plug to 1/4\\" TRS. I had to use this adapter as it \\"sums\\" the signal from the stereo outputs of the ATR-3350 plug. (Technically it is not truly a summing, but the signal is the same either way, so it works.) This adapter then runs through a Hosa GXJ-235 adapter 1/4\\" TRS - XL3M (which provides the XLR connection).<br /><br />Initial tests have the signal coming through with a very clear signal and has a powerful pickup. I think that the mic now will provide a good low-cost method to fill my needs for a lavalier mic.<br /><br />I want to add that Audio-Technica's user support was helpful and friendly throughout several back and forth email exchanges. I would add a sixth star for that support if I could.
0385523394|1.0|We read this book for our book club and no one thought it was well written. Im not even sure if I believe all of pipers story. I laughed at times but was not sure it was supposed to be funny. Piper tries real hard to be an original gangsta but comes off as a poor little rich girl gone bad.  I would not recommend this book to anyone. I wonder how her cell mates feel about this?
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|Helen Fielding proves on this third outing that there's no one like Bridget. In a world where everyone's striving to be perfect, Bridget owns up to all her flaws - procrastination, overeating and obsessing about men. When I read this book, I felt like I was visiting an old friend. Maybe there were too many fart jokes but...who cares? It's Bridget.
B00ABLJ5NQ|4.0|In places disturbing and in others instantly recognisable to any of us who remember childhood, The Ocean At The End of The Lane is an absorbing read that, cleverly, does not try to provide answers as to the nature of all of it's characters. The story of a young boy facing terrors both real and imagined is a compelling read in places and, like many of Neil Gaiman's books, is a page turner that keeps you guessing. An enjoyable read that requires some work but ultimately gives back to its readers with a finely crafted, if unusual, modern fairy tale.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|This is a much better than the camp filled first movie. I wish this movie would trigger more episodes and use some of the other stories. The bots would be good to see on the large screen.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This game is a great way to understand the rules and the mechanics of the playing. I play on steam and on my Fire.
B00FFL8ZMY|5.0|As a frame of reference...I thought the first release was a three star, the second release a four star and the third release was an awesome five star. Their sound has remained consistent, it pretty much comes down to songwriting. This one is a four star. I am enjoying it, but it just isn't as good as ABIII. Miles sounds amazing, the production is tight and Tremonti and Miles are both phenomenal guitarists. Maybe after repeatedly listens it will get the fifth star.<br /><br />Favorite Tracks: Cry of Achilles, Addicted to Pain<br /><br />**UPDATE**: After spending more time with these songs, I had to come back and give it a fifth star. Not a bad song on the whole CD.
B000FBJHT4|5.0|Very interesting, although I ended up with more questions than I had at the beginning. Also gave me a new view into how our government operates.<br /><br />The implication these crafts are from outer space, yet with the hints of time travel, seemed contradictory, but I suppose this is one of those subjects that most of us will never have full and complete answers for. If these were time traveling humans from our future, the answers would be more obvious -- but if hostile space creatures, too much info remains shrouded.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and will definitely be buying the other book as well. Keep up the good work.
B009IF82SK|5.0|Awesome! Every episode gets better and better, the love potion episode was the best! Best of Howard impersonation of famous celebrities.<br /><br />Season 7 here I come!
B00E63OMEM|5.0|I LIKE THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT TELLS ALL OF THE SECRETS,<br />ABOUT THE PEOPLE IN THE LAND OF OOO KIDS WANT TO<br />KNOW.=-}
1447231171|3.0|I hope the ending is not really the end but there is a sequel. In other words, the protagonist survived.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|it is a very nice and easy to play game. for small kids,not to intuitive,but for grownup very enterteint game.
0739365681|3.0|It was a little dated with its technology references.  The characters seemed a little slow to pick up things.  I prefer Baldacci as an author.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|This is a book meant to get you thinking, not to confirm your biases, or to present an airtight proof of the theses presented.  I finished the book still unconvinced of some of the theses, but having thought about these issues in a new way.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|By far the best (cost effective and quality) device to stream youtube and chrome browser. Its pretty fast and works flawless with all the devices connected to the home network. I hope they enhance the casting of the whole browser stream experience instead of casting specific tabs. It already has the &#34;cast entire screen&#34; which is in its experimental phase but would love to see the production version of it.

0385351399|4.0|The Circle is Dave Eggers’ response to what’s happening to us all: the fundamental transformation of human society created by perpetual electronic connectedness. Surely you’ve felt it. I know I have...and I’m glad that a major novelist like Eggers has taken it on. Someone needs to.<br /><br />Eggers wraps his criticism of this phenomenon around a company called The Circle, a thinly disguised version of Google. We experience the inner workings of The Circle through our protagonist Mae who has landed her dream job of being a “Circler,” one of the most coveted and hippest jobs that a young 20-something could hope for.<br /><br />The Circle is, from the outset, a creepy sort of insulated company in which every possible need of the Circlers (almost all of whom are under 30) is provided for: on site parties headlined by notable performers, clothing stores stocking the latest products, residences and more. Circlers need never leave the campus (and why would they want to? Surely there could be no more exciting place in the world to be). Oh, one catch: make sure to always be participating in the company’s social media at all times; a failure to participate might indicate that you’re not a team player or worse....you might be antisocial. One thing the Circle cannot abide is a lack of complete participation at all times.<br /><br />Mae quickly adapts to the ways of the Circle, easily embracing each new layer of required transparency and tracking. As a young person with nothing to hide, she can’t see any inherent difficulties in this prospect. Why wouldn’t you want to share as much as possible with everyone? Sharing--in the words of one of the Circle’s founders--is caring. Keeping information to yourself is actually an act of theft. Each piece of information you hide robs someone somewhere of the opportunity to benefit from your knowledge.<br /><br />The Circle is always debuting new technological marvels, each released to the public in a way that will be familiar to most readers: the dramatic Steve Jobs-style personal product reveal. The applause is always thunderous. Crowds can never get their hands on the new product fast enough. Each new product is pitched as the obvious solution to a pressing problem...child abductions, home violence, neighborhood crime. And on the surface, they are, but there’s always the flip side; each a fresh incursion into privacy, a further reduction in the amount of public space in which people can hide.<br /><br />Eggers introduces Mae’s ex-boyfriend Mercer as a foil to her unbridled enthusiasm for the works of the The Circle. He’s one of the only characters in the novel to ask questions, to object to this blind worship of technology and electronic monitoring. There are so many turns at which a normal person would be horrified at the prospect of The Circle’s growing power but Eggers allows only one or two characters to ever voice concern. He’s chosen instead to present the view through the eyes of the techno-faithful, showing how acceptance of such privacy incursions could be not only accepted but actively embraced. This point of view is all the more chilling. Mae’s view and that of her fellow Circlers is the perspective of youth and inexperience. They’re exhilarated to be a part of something so dramatically transformative. Their generation will put the world’s ills right. Finally human beings have the tools to fix their world’s shortcomings and they are the carriers of light.<br /><br />Of course, The Circle is a dystopian novel. Like all such novels it does its best to hold a dark mirror up to present circumstances and encourage the reader to think about what they see. It is ham-handed in places and I occasionally felt like I was being beaten over the head with the message, but then again some of its more outrageous exaggerations of online culture are not really that far off the mark. We do live in a world full of techno-profits who promise to eradicate the ills of society through the aggregation of data...ever growing avalanches of data, what we eat, when we eat it, where we’ve been, what we’ve seen, what we purchase, who we know and what we think.<br /><br />Eggers shouts at us to step back, take a breath and ask “what have we done?”.ever growing avalanches of data, what we eat, when we eat it, where we’ve been, what we’ve seen, what we purchase, who we know and what we think.<br /><br />Eggers shouts at us to step back, take a breath and ask “what have we done?”.

1781162646|4.0|In Joyland King paints his typical back drop with rich vibrant characters and setting drawing the reader in only to spring his trap in the end.
B00003CXA2|5.0|A little behind the times finally watched the movie. Tom Hanks is a true master of the acting arts. Movie was a little long.
B00ESNE696|5.0|crisp intelligent writing, convincing actors, excellent and compelling plot line.....A show even Aaron Sorkin would be proud of! I especially like the female leads.
B003G4W49C|5.0|A great book for any SiFi reader! A fascinating view on war and the lives of children. I suggest it to everyone
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|At first I thought it was way to easy. A kids game even. As I progressed the game got harder . I have had a hard time putting this game down. You have to plot out your moves ahead of time. The faster you finish the higher your score . Ads across the top are not too bothersome.
B00006JSS8|5.0|Stevie is always great to hear no matter how old the music . I recommend to ant Stevie Wonder fan.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Excellent book - really motivates you to get out and run!  Very engaging and interesting, plus it has a lot of the history of running
B00908DDZM|5.0|Love this... Macklemore is a truly talented and smart rapper. A lot of thought and meaning in every song. I rarely here a rap singer worth listening to. I am looking forward to more music from Macklemore he is a inspiration.
B005PW3OS8|5.0|Captain America: The First Avenger  great movie.  Loved it.  the acting was great in this movie.  Would totally recommend it
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Tony Bennett in his prime. Fantastic! This is a must for any fan of the greats. Fun interplay with some of our past commedians as well. Buy this!
B00F880BWG|4.0|A good start to the new season! As always the first episode sets the table for what's coming so the plot is spread pretty wide but it does a great job hinting at the new threat posed at the prision.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is a really fun game. Took a while to figure what controls I preferred. I just stick with the touch, can't figure out the tilt.
B001MVYUPC|5.0|First of all, it has BRAZILLIAN PORTUGUESE audio 5.1, and it was a big surprise when I bought it (wasn´t on description). Yeah, I´m from Brazil, so, great deal buy this masterpiece with original audio and also dubbed on my language.<br /><br />Many details of Gandhi´s life are perfectly portraited on this movie, and Ben Kingsley probably did his best appearance on cinema here. If you´re expecting to watch again Gandhi´s story, buy it and be prepared 'to see himself' on HD.
B0063GORYU|4.0|It certainly gets the brain working and is addictively entertaining. Time just flies by. The only drawback are the annoying intrusive adverts.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The writing is beautiful and poetic  BUT  characters become very confusing and the theme is laborious. I have had enough of the miseries of Afganistan.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was great, so great. The voice of this book is a teen girl experiencing adult situations, i.e. illness. Though this was a quick read, I experienced a range of emotions, this book made me feel so much. I'm definitely going to buy the hardcopy so I can read it over and over again.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I recently got hooked on this game when I got back on Facebook and was disappointed when it wasn't available on my kindle. I was so excited to see today that's  it now available and I can't wait to play it!
B00ANYJ3NI|5.0|A great story for sure,but Lewis knows his subject well and explains its complexity in a very readable way-funny as well-you really can't make this stuff up-nobody would believe you.Buy this book-you will learn a lot.
B00499QUK2|5.0|I watched season 1 because a diverse set of friends from around the world were comparing Sherlock to Dr. Who, Castle and Avengers.  I had to see what all the excitement was about, and there was excitement!  This is an excellent, modern take on a brilliant literary tradition.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy to set up and works exactly as advertised.  Now streaming movies makes sense and Youtube clips work just great.
B00E3IZIM0|1.0|horrid case though. discs are stacked on each other shoulda bought the normal edition. not worth 35 dollars. super sad
B0031KC8OC|5.0|This show is just as good now as when it originally aired. I'm amazed by how well it holds up. If only other shows about teenagers were half as intelligent as Veronica Mars. What a pleasure to watch this. It's fun and clever. Looking forward to the movie!
1856697061|5.0|Great book do recommend. Very beautiful patterns and fair explanation. I bought this out of reomendation and do not regret a bit.
B00F35B8F8|2.0|poor acting that typlifies the youth of today....no depth just a bunch of lights flashing and thing blowing up. Crap
039916409X|1.0|These comments are not based on the merits of the book. I use EFT and find it very helpful. I am just starting to follow the book.<br /><br />I'm giving the book one star, because there are some things to consider before buying the book. I will update this review, after I've finished the book.<br /><br />There are some things related to this book that I'm not happy with.<br /><br />Whenever I see Nick Ortner tied to a book, I begin to wonder. He is a master of over-marketing.<br /><br />Most of the reviews are by people who did not buy the book or only reviewed one item.<br /><br />Here are some comments about the videos, associated with the book.<br /><br />The information that I've seen, seems to be very helpful.<br /><br />HOWEVER...<br /><br />You'll probably only be able to watch a video for a few minutes. You will quickly become aware that all Margaret Lynch does is wave her arms around. This is so annoying that you'll find it hard to focus on what she is saying. Be warned!<br /><br />I look forward to honest reviews by people who have had success with the ideas in the book.
B003YV64OI|5.0|I don't have any problem with anything I do! I don't play many games but the ones I have played, work very well! Processor runs cool!!
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|This girl is so darn talented.  I preordered the cd after falling in love with Royals, now I love them all!!!  The beat is infectious.
B00CNQ7CRI|3.0|I adore Helen Fielding's work. I've enjoyed Olivia, Rosie, and of course Bridget. And yet...<br /><br />Pros & Cons for &#34;Mad About The Boy&#34;<br /><br />Pros:<br />Another Rebecca, only not a jellyfisher (the only character to make me laugh out loud)<br />Am a mother (there were plenty of been-there moments)<br />Satisfied some curiosity about what happened next<br />Scott. Would have loved to see more of them, though<br /><br />Cons:<br />Twitter and texting- only fun when you're the one flirting<br />Endless fart humor<br />Mark. I get it, but v. disappointed.<br />Daniel.<br />Kids- fun, but their ages were confusing. I couldn't figure out easily just how old they were supposed to be, since math is not my strong point, and their language level seemed to bounce around. They often felt closer to my 4 and 2 year old than the 8 and 3 I ended up coming up with.<br />Rockster. Was he supposed to be bulimic?<br />Editing. I kept getting weird apostrophes on my kindle version, and many pages were... Loose. It felt like either no one wanted to correct Fielding, or they were sitting there chanting &#34;hurry up, just finish it, anything will do. We just need something to continue the movie franchise&#34;<br /><br />For most of the novel I kept thinking &#34;This is why they end with happily ever after&#34;.  It ended well, and I'll eventually read it again, but... Only die-hard Fielding fans who happen to be mothers will love it.
B007JOM0GC|4.0|Great beat for running and it is fun to listen at work or when I am in the car. Also good music if you do spinning.
B00FPH6A70|5.0|This is one of the best scary movies I have seen in a while.  This was one actually worth buying.
B008BTC5E6|3.0|a nice book that describes Jurek's life till reaching his very appreciated achievements, with very nice recipes, but missing the pro fundamentals.
0375869026|5.0|We used this as a class book, answered some great questions. It was great for character perspective since the author took out some chapters that were from various other characters to give the reader a better picture of what Auggie went through. Completely recommend. My students could NOT get enough of this book! Downloaded the audio book and LOVED how the chapters voices changed with the characters.
0876391277|4.0|for intermediate player. Not really what I expected. most of these I already know, but if you can get something new out of it, it is worth the price. Interesting book
B00D4E9BDQ|3.0|Listen to each song and buy the ones you like. Wouldn't recommend the entire album.<br />I recommend White Noise and Fire Starts to Burn.
B008I43DYU|5.0|The calculator pro is very easy to use. It was easy to learn. My grand kid's even found it easy to use.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|Our entire family loved this movie and still watch it on a regular basis. I can't say enough good things about it. The quality is super and the case is sturdy.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|a really fun and cute game. cute graphics. love the fish. only wish there were more free levels. highly recommend.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I particularly don't like the fact that you have energy lightning should take it off but good over all graphics and way too cool game...... more reports to come
B008RA3X5E|4.0|East to use! This app does what it is supposed to do, not very exciting but it works. Would buy it again.
B00DJUPLY8|5.0|I 'm not very good at learning new things anymore.  I'm 75.  The newly purchased Kindle Fire HD, with all the APPs I ordered, has caused me a lot of short term confusion.  But this player is as easy to use  as the other players in  my Tablet.  Whenever I want to play a movie, a tune,  or a video, a list of players pops-up for me to choose.  What could be easier?.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|Got this after my water cooler crapped out on me.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Super Quiet<br />Black  Fans<br />Comes with Thermal Paste<br />Looks Pretty<br />Cools Better That My Water Cooler<br /><br />Cons:<br />Really bad install instructions: only tiny pictures to indicate which screws to use or where they go. The steps aren't even number. Installation took about half an hour because of this and it was my first time replacing one of these. Beyond that there isn't much to complain about. It's pretty big if that's an issue for you but it worked fine for me.
B004Y1QKKK|5.0|I've become a fan of this writer and it's great to have so much in such a small, digital, package.  Kindle books take very little space in my Tablet.  Some times, like vacations and business trips, it's a good thing to have an entire library tag along.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|At One Point This App Was On High Demand By People From Every Lifestyle Everywhere.  This Is One Application That Like Many Artists, TV Shows, Sequels, etc., It Has Gone Down The Drain To The Bottom Where It Is Recommended Best Not To Explore.  It Has Devolved.  Videos &amp; Music Downloads Will Only Play Halfway &amp; After That You Are Expected To Rejoice To The Fact That At Least Half Of What You Wanted Was Given To You At No Cost At All.  In Other Words, Bend Over &amp; Take It.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I bought this for my sister for her birthday so that she could catch up on the show. (I have watched it from the very begining and she wanted to catch up before season 2 started.) I haven't personally watched the DVD's so I don't know if there are any spcial features or anything, but this show in general is awesome! It is 3 episodes into the 3rd season now and I love watching the clever ties between the different worlds and times, and the little twists on our favorite fairy tales. Mind blowing almost every episode.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Ten times better than the movie and yet ten times more poignant and riddled with sadness!! I think the movie did a piss poor job. Already bought the second book and gonna start it right away!!!
B0049J2CKE|5.0|A cartoon that keeps both the young and old entertained. Enjoyed the story. Also teaches lesson about honesty, love and what is important.
1607066017|5.0|One of my favorite titles right now. Great art, relatable characters, and really well written. One of the only comics I've ever got my wife interested in. Seriously a must have.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Are we all killers in a way, drawn to destroying ourselves, the ones we love, through action or inaction? The past cannot be undone but maybe if can be just a dark place that one can move out of. This plot is so twisted and tragic but enthralling and ultimately kind of bittersweet
B00AB2NYNC|5.0|Excellent music and DVD of the live performance was more than fun to watch! The musicianship of these guys is phenomenal and captivating.
B0056C6XIA|5.0|As this was  gift, I really don't have much to say about the product. The recipient was happy and nothing more has been said.<br />Ordering was easy; delivery was prompt.
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|I reallyenjoyed this game.  This my type of game even thought it was a bit easy. Like a little more of a challenge. Thank you no ho. Wast of time.  Unless that's your thang.<br />.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|great game however need to buy gear or have a 70 kill the dragons.. be warned. if kindle dies during playing. it will become corrupt and needs to be reinstalled..
B00F35BV64|4.0|Enjoyed the action.  Thanks for keeping Trek Alive. Always like seeing the old Spock.  I believe he went into the reactor during the weekly show to save the 1701.
B00DHRLK84|5.0|Best zombie movie ever. Brad did a great job with the story.Would highly reccomend buying the 3D version.hope there is a sequel.
B006DGOV9Q|5.0|Great and efficient product. Works very good. Shipping was easily and smoothly . I can give 5 stars for that purchase.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I prefer Rowling's writing when she deals with magic. This book got the message across, a very important one at that, but reading it was very tedious, a problem on every page. Rowling can support a cause without necessarily writing fiction about it. She might have done a better job researching and reporting real facts and stories.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|It is great. But sometimes the kindle fire makes it hard to work. Like the tipping and stuff like that.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Use it almost everyday. Clear and easy to read. I will keep it and install on other devices. Would recommend to others.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Super easy to use. Hours of fun. Keeps track of your saved games. No freezing of game during play....highly recommended app..
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|This is a great mic for the price. It is well made and sounds good once you replace the battery. The overall construction of the mic is rubberized cabling and aluminum housing. The construction is higher than what you would expect in this price range. However there are several issues the mic that prevent me from giving it 5 stars:<br /><br />1) The battery included works but causes a strange low hissing sound in your audio. It is not hard to clean up in post, but it is annoying. I did a quick search and read other people complaining about the same issue. It goes away once you replace the battery. I popped in a new bat and the sound is clear and clean.<br /><br />2) There is no battery indicator at all. You will have no idea how much juice is left when you go to use it. This is a bit frustrating to me as I record 1.5-2 hour lectures. I would not want this to die 1/2 way though because I did not know the battery was low on juice. A small LED indicator would have been nice.<br /><br />3) The foam windscreen is worthless. Well, not worthless as it does work, but it will not stay on. It fell off twice on during my first use and I lost it on my second use.<br /><br />4) This is clearly listed in the description so it is hard to complain about it, but take note that the cable length is 20 feet. This is good if you are going to plug into a camera and sit as you will have plenty of space between you and the camera. But I walk around and do not want to be tethered to a camera, so I plug my mic into a Tascam DR-05 to record audio. This requires me to stuff 20' feet of cabling into my pocket. It would have been nice if the cabling after the on/off switch was optional.
B003E88TKS|4.0|Good movie.  When it dawns on you that the title refers to losing your livelihood rather than flying the friendly skies, it makes the story more compelling.  A thoughtful, well-crafted movie.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Family and I love science fiction movies and shows so were shocked we didn't know about this one until recently. So sorry we didn't know about it sooner. We've now watched all the shows in 2 days. I can't stop thinking about it. Thank goodness Joss made the movie Serenity but we still want more.  Characters are real and engaging. Love Nathan Fillion. Maybe Mal and Inara are together out there somewhere. &#34;You can't take the sky from me.&#34;
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I love the series and I would give it five stars but they have killed off the best two characters :( first Sybal and now Matthew?? Boo hoo they have a loyal fan base because of our attachment to the characters however if you kill one off every season for a cliff hanger you're not endearing anyone. But overall it's the best series I've seen in a long time and I look forward to season four...although it will seem a bit cold without Matthew.
B0002HY750|5.0|All the Schleich horses are great, this is no exception....  and it is super extra mega adorable.  I want one for myself.  Soooo cute.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|it was put to good use really didn't know what it was for and what to do with it now I know
B004LROMWU|4.0|I bought this at another store, Season One, thinking it was a movie.  But was equally happy that it is a series.  We got Season Two from Amazon, I think, but does anyone know when Season Three is coming out?  It is a pretty good series, but I have heard people say that it unfolds so slowly they don't watch it anymore.  Since we don't have cable, we buy the series, and watch the whole season in just a few nights, and have found it pretty good.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Awesome book wish it didnt end  i really liked this book from the beginning to end.  Highly recommend it. Wow
B009NG1Q96|5.0|OMG! I cant believe its over i am so excited for book three!!! It was so good im going to reread it its that good!!!
B00FPH3YQA|2.0|Piss poor 3rd sequel.  I know its tough to duplicate, but this was really bad.<br />Its like pulling a hang nail, you know its going to hurt but you can't help yourself.<br />Same with a 3rd sequel... You're pretty sure its going to suck but you can't help yourself since the 1st was so damn funny you assume the 3rd would at least be worth the 90 minutes.  Too bad.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Blooms TD has been my favorite online game for several years now. However when I got it on my kindle; it blew me away with its amazing graphics and towers. I think that with every update the game gets better and better. The recent one added a wood chipper like tower to the game. This game is worth every penny and would recommend it to anyone who loves TDs, blooms, and hours of not stop fun.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|Works with Jailbroken Ipod Touch 4G. nuff said.<br /><br />Obviously works with current gen ipads/iphones as the hardware and firmware are more updated.<br /><br />This adapter is great as you can mirror your device and charge/sync at the same time.

B00AZMFJYA|5.0|A must see for any Star Trek saga lover. I loved the original ST best of all of course but the series continues on and I've grown to accept the actors of the latest, as the characters I loved in the original.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The British have given us a real gift in Downton Abbey.  The historical aspect, beautiful scenes, interesting characters and gorgeous costuming add authenticity to this fast moving plot.  We are anxiously awaiting Season 4.  Wouldn't miss it!
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I have updated it a lot but it wont let me play at all even when it is done downloading
1476727651|1.0|This is not his best work.  Usually his books grab you in the first chapter and hold you until the end.  This one didn't do that at all.  At first, I thought it was because I never read The Shining.  But I don't really think that's the reason.  I have read just about every book King has written, including The Dark Tower series, and this book was not at all what I expected.<br /><br />I didn't like the characters, didn't enjoy the dialogue, didn't like the fact that this was not a patented Stephen King horror story.  The book was not gripping, the action came in dribs and drabs.  And I use the term \\"action\\" very loosely.  It lacked imagination, it lacked horror, it lacked suspense.  Once I start reading a King novel, I usually can't put it down. This one I couldn't wait to put it down.  I stuck it out until the end, just because I figured there must be something to this book I'm missing.  The end didn't cut it for me either.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Fun but I came back one day to play and my game levels were deleted I was on level 11 now I'm back to 3 I still have my armor I earned but now I'm back to level 3 so please fix this problem I really enjoy this game

B00D48BSBA|4.0|Obviously inspired by Osama Bin Laden's \\"neutralization\\" by US marines,\\" The Kill List\\" reads like a typical Forsyth novel: Meticulous , painfully researched and thrilling. A must read for all Forsyth fans!

0307352153|5.0|I have recommended this book to friends because it provides a most interesting and informative view of the place of Introverts in our society.  It also gives important insight into the personalities of Extroverts.
B00AEFY6ZQ|5.0|I remember this movie from long ago.  Mancini's music complemented what was on screen.  I had forgotten that zoos hired people to capture certain animals for them.  The scenery was spectacular and the story line wasn't complicated.  Overall, it was a fun movie to see again.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Easy read as the foreign words are defined in the context of the story.<br /><br />Such an inspiring story about one so young who has achieved so much, while maintaining her beliefs in the most humble way.

B003PIUBZS|5.0|This is a wonderful series.  Quite a bit of violence and sex.  Very Rome.  It is very well done.  Andy Whitfield is very convincing.  I would highly recommend this to adults only.
0670024856|5.0|Gilbert's novel has been my constant companion for the past four or five days.  The characters are exceedingly well drawn, and Gilbert reveals their actions and motivations with frankness and compassion. Highly recommended!
0783225482|4.0|It's a funny movie with some great actors.  Lots of fun. I would recommend it to anyone over 13 years
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Great graphics, challenging virtual shots. This has been great way to pass time while sitting in the hunting blind, or while sitting in the living room, hell or during any down time.
B00B8R1NP0|4.0|Just what the book reader ordered! Time Killer draws you in from page one and keeps you there. The story line's originality will keep me coming back for more. I can't wait to see what Max Larkin and his partner are up against next.! Thank you Todd Thiede.
1577314808|5.0|Inspiring book ~ great to help those who have a hard time quieting the voice inside so meditation can happen.
B00006L7MV|5.0|One of the best surround albums I've heard. It is mixed very well and the surround is impressive. I prefer this as a demo over most of my SACD albums.  If you have a DVD-Audio capable player, this comes highly recommended.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I've heard of the author through my &#34;military&#34; friend from childhood. So why not?! It's a great read and a must.
1439192812|5.0|It is very interesting and informative! It is a book for kids of all ages to enjoy. It makes reality fun!
B00CTERB2A|5.0|The whole show is just the best.  Love the character development and the surprise plot twists.  It's great to see the supposedly &#34;every day sheriff&#34; keep his cool and help solve the problems when a multitude of brainiacs cannot.  He connects the dots.  Right now we could use his common sense in Congress (either house)!<br /><br />Oh, and did I mention---NO COMMERCIALS!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is so useful. It's basic yes but sometime that's just what the world needs. Think about it. And you will use this app everyday.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is a classic Stephen King novel, once you're hooked you can't put it down. I loved finding out how Danny's life was influenced by his father's alcohol abuse and his encounter with the evil at the Overlook. It was a surprise to find out how he dealt with his demons.
0375869026|5.0|I got this book for my son, who just had to have it as soon as possible.  Came right on time as promised and in good condition.
B00AEFYGJW|2.0|The movies great, but I question if the &#34;Blu-Ray&#34; is HD or not.  It seems to be CD quality and doesn't look that great on a HD TV.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This product will most likely not do what you think! The only and I mean only files you can stream must either come from You Tube, Net Flix, Hulu Plus, or Google Play. If you want to play anything outside of those cloud services you will be disappointed. No local content from computers, network hard drives, phones, or tablets  on your network will be able to stream. Nothing you record on your phone, no pictures from your phone. Outside of you tube, and google play music content you have uploaded, must be purchased through either a monthly subscription (Hulu Plus, Net Flix,) or must be bought from Google Play.<br /><br />What is most disappointing is this hardware is perfectly capable of doing everything I mentioned above. They refuse to let developers release apps to allow this. Google has turned to the old practices of Apple; purposing limiting you hardware for their own financial gain at the frustration of the customer.<br /><br />I can't believe I am going to say this, and it pains me to do so, but I should have bought something more like an Apple TV.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Windows setup did not work at all on my Windows 8 laptop. Eventually &#34;not recommended&#34; method of manual setup through the browser only worked.<br />Streaming capabilities are still limited. Chrome browser tab casting is good for static page only. Any animation not impressive at all.<br />Let's see how soon we may have a better support and new features.
B00DQZQPNM|3.0|I was excited when this cover finally came, as it had been back-ordered, and I found myself worried I would break my new kindle every time I handled it!  However, when the cover came, I was actually a little disappointed.<br /><br />I like the \\"snap-in\\" feature of the back much more than the strap-feature other covers use, and I feel like my kindle is safe and secure.  The three-choices for standing the kindle up for viewing and watching movies were a nice surprise (I only expected one standing-position), and I found that they all worked well.<br /><br />However, I like to fold the cover back on my kindle cover when I am reading, allowing me to hold the kindle as if it were the actual size of the device.  While it is possible to fold the cover behind the device with this case, the thick leather binding band sticks out awkwardly and makes it difficult to hold comfortably.  I often find myself opening the cover up because I find it so awkward to hold.  I was pretty disappointed, as one of the reasons I purchased this version of the Kindle was the small size.  The design of this cover makes the kindle essentially twice the size, which I found very disappointing.  I also noticed that there is no picture of the cover all the way open / the front cover folded back, so I had no idea this was an issue until I received it.<br /><br />Overall, this case/cover does the job of protecting my kindle and I'm no longer worried about breaking it, I just wish that more users had been kept in mind in the concept-- as is, it appears that only those who use the kindle in the \\"landscape\\" or \\"viewing\\" position were thought of during the design process.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Wonderful game, my son and I both love this game and compete to<br />see who is a better shot. Highly recommend it!<br />Outstanding
B0071MQBX0|5.0|Best Phantom production ever! It's like being at the opera, symphony & ballet all in one performance! I'll watch it over & over.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Its OK but I can see why its cheap. Only YouTube and netflix. It is No Apple TV or Roku. Save your money and go for Apple TV if you have IOS device
B00C7EGV5U|4.0|An interesting look at how lives were changed by missionaries from a different perspective. It is well written and a great African tale.
B00A9C3RNQ|4.0|It's worth owning. Good movie. I'm a a Senior. Probably not funny to kids, but good movie for my generation.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|My son loves the song and the game.  Kind of makes him think of all the things that could hurt him.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Is a very good move.<br /><br />Was not expecting much from this movie with all the drama surrounding Tom Cruise's personal life but<br />I have to say that this was a very good movie and the acting was very good.<br /><br />Story line and special effects were very good.<br /><br />Very original story line.<br /><br />Highly reccomend this movie to watch
B000OLROWC|5.0|My kids loved this movie. Yes, it is super cheesy, but not for a 7 year old. Great themes explored like pacifism, bullying, and that being kind and valiant (and working hard) win in the end. If your kids are used to more violent movies, this may seem pretty tame, but mine were obsessed with the karate aspect. I couldn't get my little black belts to stop doing the crane move for days! I would highly recommend!
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|I have to say that I am dissapointed in this movie.<br /><br />In my opinion this is the worst of the 3 iron man movies.<br /><br />The villain is not very powerfull and I did not feel as connected to the story line.<br /><br />The special effects are of course very good as one can expect from a big budget movie.<br /><br />I hope that the next Iron Man will be much better.<br /><br />But to say as advertised on TV that this is the best Iron man movie is quite an understatement<br />and I am very dissapointed as I was expting a lot more as advertised on TV.<br /><br />I am thankfull that I did not watch this one on the big movie screen and only rented it.<br /><br />For a rental it is okay to watch
B008DVJO8C|4.0|This band is really hard and melodic..FINALLY a girl rocker that CAN sing!! And she does! The music is great and well played. Really good guiatrs!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|this is a really good app for staying connected with family and friends you have anything you want on this app whoever says it is bad is stupid
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|They do make attempts to tie this in with the Avengers. I could see where they tried to straddle the entertainment line to attract both adults and kids. I felt it got cheesy compared to previous ones but it is the third movie so it is to expected. Worth a watch with the family and kids.
B00F91H666|4.0|**SPOILERS** I heard from all my zombie friends that I wasn't going to like this movie, cause it \\"wasn't like the book, except for the title...\\" I think people who are REALLY INTO the book were disappointed, and, in some cases, even pissed off about that. I read parts of the book, and went into the film with an open mind. I ended up liking it a lot more than I thought I would...With a few caveats. I don't think they needed SUCH a big-time actor as Brad Pitt to plat the two-dimensional Gerry. John Cusak would have worked, or Dennis Quaid (both have experience in end-of-world stories)...Even Bruce Willis would have convinced me that he was a RETIRED UN guy...Ben Affleck would have worked. ANY actor who has ever done an \\"action\\" movie. Or they could have put the BRILLIANT Mirielle Enos in as the lead action character (or any Angelina-Jolie-Halle-Berry type actor...What an idea, having a FEMALE lead action hero character. In this film, Ms.Enos was INCREDIBLY underused, serving ONLY as the worried wife and mom, without even the guts to fight for her family when they were getting kicked off the ship.<br />HOWEVER...The ZOMBIES rocked my WORLD! Running, snapping, screaming, and they change in TWELVE SECONDS! Okay people are also pissed about THAT, but  it makes some scenes MUCH more dramatic. Overall, I liked it. Ifyou are looking for lots of gore, wander over to AMC on Sunday nights and check out \\"The Walking Dead.\\" or watch some Romero films. This is the zombie flick you can show to your tweens, depending on their level or maturity and tendency to have nightmares from \\"scary movies.\\"
B00425S1H8|5.0|The software drivers were easy to install and it provided the needed serial comm to Rockwell Software products. Great product.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I have been using this air cooler for over 6 months now with an Intel i5-2500k overclocked to 4.3 Ghz and the temperatures are great playing Battlefield, Final Fantasy 14 ARR, Diablo 3, etc.
B001NLKT60|5.0|The characters are so well developed, and the story line so well written that it makes it impossible to set the book down!
B003NBCA9C|5.0|The short: There's a noticeable difference in endurance and energy during workouts and competition, and recovery is much quicker with these on post activity.<br />Size: Medium (Slightly long for my legs, still love em)<br />Stats: 5'8\\" 175lbs<br />Activities used in: Crossfit, Ice Hockey<br /><br />I primarily bought these for recovery from crossfit workouts and hockey games, and did notice a difference in recovery time with that use. One day I decided to give them a go during a hockey game and noticed a tremendous difference in performance with them on, going the full game with no real fatigue or lactic acid build up, even during longer shifts I could still make a good breakaway when the opportunity arose. If you play a sport that's a lot of leg, I definitely recommend these for the pre, post, and during.<br /><br />Sizing: Like I said earlier, the medium size are a bit long for my 5'8\\" 175lb frame, but still do the job, and I will be purchasing the medium \\"short\\" size for a second set.<br /><br />I primarily bought these for recovery from crossfit style workouts and hockey games and
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|This product is awesome but it's very restricted. You can't play what you want. You have to upload the video to Youtube then play it on TV.<br /><br />It does not work in offline. You must be connected to Internet.<br /><br />IT'S WASTE OF MONEY.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|This is a well-written book.  The plot is unique and fun to follow.  The characters are interesting.  The ending was unexpected, and not up to the rest of the book.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|Your book was good enough for me to read it so it must of mean good but a lot like a less bloody version of the hunger games. Have you ever thought that stealing ideas of a controlled life is rude.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|We have enjoyed many movies thru the use of this little Chromecast HDMI Streaming Media Player and the HDMI Pigtail Switch.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft it is a super fun game to play it has been the time I spend my time in now 7.0.6
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|You cannot miss with this well-written and excellently-casted classic.  Only the most jaded viewer will not be able to see that which cannot  be seen.
B008Q08IV4|5.0|Tom Hanks deserved every article written, praising his performance in this movie.  It has so many twist and turns, but shows that all of us are capable of being a hero and not even realize it.  While it is a fictional movie, it is set in times all of us remember and events that most saw on television.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|What a ton of fun.  My daughter (7years old) loves it.  I have a great time playing it.  I play very few phone/tablet games because I just get bored really quick.  This game rocks!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is really fun to play and I would recommend for all ages plus it's funny and it is the best game in the wold
B008RKGF1I|5.0|I love the movie  it is exciting and I saw it a few years back and it was just as good this time a great theme and  just heart loving movie
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush is on the loose! Next stop, Amazon Kindle Fire! I am a proud Kindle Fire owner and Amazon customer, but my adoration of Amazon just moved up a notch! To be honest, the only thing Kindle Fire has been missing is this app - now nothing can stop global domination of Kindle Fire. Thank you Candy Crush and thank you Amazon for exploiting my addiction to matching similar candies in groups of three or more.
B007SGM084|5.0|You can sooo lost in these books as well as the characters. I can't put it down for one minute.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|My favorite movie ever ! I bought it to enjoy it on my kindle whenever I want to watch it I can enjoy it ! Love the options that comes with the movie like closed captions and of course the x-Ray .
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Good entertaining film I don't think it's for small children to much violence. So please to note and watch the movie your self before you let the little ones
B001DSNEJM|5.0|This thriller is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat as Paul Walker is trying to figure out a series of mysterious events. Shipping was super fast and the movie was in perfect condition!
B006R4H5FG|5.0|Sparked me to move out of my PowerPoint mindset to a much bigger and much more energizing relationship with myself as a presentation, facilitator, student and transmitter of information.  An engaging read about the art of engaging!
B005MMY9A8|4.0|This move was filled with great action and a good plot.  I enjoyed it. I am looking forward to seeing the sequel.
B00EXVZZE8|1.0|flash version is a lot better and free. A short stupid music loop is annoying. Where is fun? I didn't get
B002M9WW30|1.0|I do not live in the USA and nowhere in the page said the discs were locked to &#34;Zone A&#34; hence I can't watch it on my PlayStation.<br /><br />With DVDs and Blu-Rays it should be made absolute clear if they have regional locks. I either wasted my money or I might be lucky if I can re sell it on eBay.<br /><br />Can't return it because I do not know where I left receipt
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|See it for Jennifer Lawrence's performance alone. The range of emotion she can convey with just her face draws you in as if you were there experiencing it for yourself. Very well done.
B000SXMSJ0|5.0|Her music never gets old and always in style. I've listened to her music for many years. It helps relax you after a hard day at the office.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE the app it's just that I want them to add more items and wish they would come up with the updates more quicker but over all I suggest the app.
B00DB624GS|5.0|Loved It , this album was recommended to me by a friend , it's a great Blues sound , never knew that about Fleetwood....
B00DW1WR14|2.0|Pearl Jam is a great band. I've seen them live, and that's where they are actually one of the very best bands in the world. Some of their albums are amazing too. This one isn't amazing at all. It's actually quite boring, aside from a couple of tracks. I don't know why, but most PJ tracks put out in the past few years sound virtually the same to my ear. It's like they have a sonic cookie cutter that they use every time. I realize they are mixing up rhythms, styles, tones, and even instruments, but the feel is predictable and formulaic. Eddie has one of the best voices in rock history, and he is a very good lyricist, but I also don't think he's at his best trying to teach philosophy or approaches to religious questions.<br /><br />In summary, I would recommend just downloading Mind Your Manners and maybe Getaway if you are a hardcore PJ fan. Otherwise, don't bother with this one.<br /><br />I gave it two stars to match the number of songs that I can stand listening to without wanting to hit fast forward.
B00AANGHXQ|5.0|THE BEST GUITAR PICKER.  Gone but not forgotten....love this album, never be another like Stevie...may he rest in peace and hope he is jamming in heaven.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works great with my Nexus 10.  Just downloaded the app, plugged the Chromecast into the TV and was hooked up in 2 minutes.  The video feed looks like HD 99% of the time.  On occaison it will get a little blurry but fix itself.  Typical for wifi-streaming video via Netflix.  Still trying to figure out how or if it's capible of internet browsing.  So far, I have no clue.  I'm sure the google nerds will figure it out.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Oh how I miss this show ....the best TV since I LOVE LUCY....You cant help but have compassion for Walt.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Don't start this till you have lots of time:  this is one you won't want to put down.  Well done.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|I miss these people. Great drama, kept you on the edge of your seat....glad Jessie survived and hope he lives happily ever after.
B006M7JCC2|4.0|I thought it was very moving and spiritual.  As we all know, we will all die and it is so wonderful to hear what the experience will be like.  My sister almost died and she said she saw my dad (who told her it wasn't her time to join him).  This book was enlightening .
B008JFUR10|4.0|Many have compared this film to Transformers on first glance alone. But other than some giant robots, there really isn’t much to compare. Pacific Rim has more depth (no pun intended) and is darker, edgier and certainly more suspenseful. The invading Kaiju are monstrous, Godzilla-like creatures that come through a portal within the Earth. Earth unites and creates enormous robots that take a two-man team to pilot. This works for a while, but the Kaiju are adapting and becoming stronger and smarter.<br /><br />Pacific Rim is an action-packed, science fiction disaster film – with a looming global apocalypse. Yet it also has just the right amount of heart and humor to balance the suspense. This is a surprisingly fun and visually stunning film with amazing CGI. The Jaeger robots and Kaiju are just as much characters in the story as the actors’ roles.<br /><br />Blu-ray 3D Combo Pack and Blu-ray Combo Pack Special Features:<br />• Audio Commentary by Guillermo del Toro<br />• The Directors Notebook<br />• Drift Space<br />• The Digital Artistry of Pacific Rim<br />• The Shatterdome<br />• Focus Points<br />• Deleted Scenes<br />• Blooper Reel<br /><br />2-Disc Standard Definition DVD Special Edition Special Features:<br />• Audio Commentary by Guillermo del Toro<br />• Drift Space<br />• The Digital Artistry of Pacific Rim<br />• The Shatterdome<br />• Focus Points<br />• Deleted Scenes<br />• Blooper Reel<br /><br />*Review previously posted at SciFiChick.
B004X6PRO6|2.0|I felt this book was hard to get through (I only got through the first few chapters of Part 2) and it was quite confusing. The author wrote beautifully, I just wish there were smoother transitions and better explanations within the plot. I also felt there were a lot of things (the metal CB box, Jun Do's mother, the Nike shoes etc.) spoke about in Part 1 that I thought would come full circle and be explained or help finalize the story eventually, but didn't. I know because I discussed and asked these questions with my Book Club and know what happens in Part 2. I was encouraged to finish the book as \\" it gets much better\\", but I had already invested too much time and not excited to go back to it. I had to give up!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Captivating, I think, comes closest. I started it and read half of the book in one sitting. It is impossible to put down. 5 out of 5 stars all the way.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I luv the the book. Honestly a lot of stuff was left out of the movie. In the book you see more of who Percy Jackson is. You see more of grover, and Anabeth Chase. The book explains more about half bloods then the movie. So if your thinking it just like the movie. Your wrong it is a lot funnier then the movie.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have had one now for a few years.  It carries a 'hefty' library within it.  It is compact, fits into my handbag snugly, and I can whip it out to read it in doctor's waiting rooms, on the train, anywhere really where there is a few quiet minutes.  I am never idle, or lonely.  I love the convenience, and of course if I have loved a particular good book,  I then go back to my beloved Amazon.com and buy the hard copy for my library.  Thank you being there.  Eva Morris
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I found a few songs by Imagine Dragons on YouTube and decided to get one of their albums and check them out. I wasn't disappointed. I almost never find albums where I listen to ever single song, but this the exception. I listen to it every day on my morning walk. I love that the songs have a wide range of, what I guess I would call themes. There's songs like Demons which is about inner demons, and then there's a song like Tip Toe which is really a positive feeling song.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|As soon as I finished this book I text my book reading girl friends and told them this was a must read!
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I think I downloaded it when it was free, but I'm not 100 percent sure. Because  I know for a fact that I wouldn't download an app above five dollars (not that I'm cheap, I just don't spend money on apps). Please respond back because I'm really worried. This app is too pricey for what I'd normally go for.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Suzanne Collins has made these books a must read, can't put them down for a moment. This last installation of The Hunger Games series is the most gruesome, heart wrenching, tear filed book. All I can say is that she is an amazing writer and she has done a beautiful job with this series. You have to read it. All of them.

B000SCHC0Q|5.0|One of my favorite books I've ever read. If you loved Cutting for Stone orThe Kite Runner, you will love this one.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I am having a hard time putting this book down.  Have already bought the second in this trilogy so I can continue on as soon as the first is read.
B00CATONCA|5.0|My husband bought this and he refuses to open it. We watched a youtube video of someone opening theirs and assembling it. That was good enough for him. This product looks very cool. Wish we could open ours.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|We missed the first season but were able to catch that up via net flix.  However, the second season was not available.  We wanted to catch up so we could view the 3rd season in the regularly scheduled time slot on tv.  As soon as the 2nd season became available we  bought it from Amazon and were able to finally get in sync with the rest of the world!
B00DUL3VFM|4.0|I remember watching this when it first came out.  I was a young adult.  Now I have 3 boys.  They all enjoyed the movie, especially the 13 year old.  I guess I would recommend this movie as a family movie because there will be questions.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|A nice collection of Beatles songs by some great sounding artists.Have turned my of my friends on to this music.
B00DMXJC56|5.0|Excellent, Love the rocking soulful sounds. The music is so great and fresh. I will continue to share this CD with friends and family.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Fantastic special effects!  Truly made a classic come to life. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys fantasy movies.
B00E38KGF4|5.0|WORK VERY WELL,...AND WILL USE AGAIN...ALSO TOLD MY SISTER ABOUT IT SHE HAS A TABLET..AND I TOLD SHE MIGHT WANT ANTIVIRUS FOR IT, SHE DOWNLOAD IT ON HER TABLET.....DOWNLOAD IS VERY EASY..I HAVE A KINDLE FIRE HD 8.9
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Great for quick presos.  No cables from laptop to computer.  Needs SW sdk.  Performance can vary.  Recommend for those who want to stream from computers for little $.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|ALL I CAN SAY IS GREAT GREAT GREAT LOVE IT !!!!!!!!!! MY SISTER AND A CO WORKER TURN ME ON TO PICsART I USE IT ON ALL MY PICS.
B00008D1NF|5.0|Heard this last summer in Europe- had to buy it immediately. I love it. It is lively and romantic. BEJA!
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Very concise & revealing history of the Eagles. The musical CD is perfect especially if you have big screen HD TV & a 5.1 or higher home theater speakers.
B00931JMRE|5.0|Originally I purchased this album for my Dad, for Father's Day, because he's a ZZ Top fan, but I decided to give it a listen and I really enjoyed it too. I really like the songs &#34;I Got's To Get Paid&#34; and &#34;Charteuse&#34;.
B00B4FU6KE|4.0|I was drawn in immediately, wondering what in the world had happened to this family....and then I thought I knew.  Nope.  Maybe it was this...no.  And then finally, what?!!!  I was blown away.  I just had to keep reading.  Great book.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|Bought this as an addition to my kids Disney classic DVD collection.  The two disc edition was a bonus and the price and delivery time made an excellent purchase.  Looking forward to enjoying many sessions with kids and this DVD.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|What an awful movie. The story may have been great but I will never know because after 20 minutes I just could not handle the erratic cinematography anymore. Certainly don't watch this movie if you're an epileptic. The camera moves constantly, in and out, side to side, up and down. Maybe the poor guy is ADD I don't know but the whole experience made my eyes and my head hurt. They were obviously trying to create a certain artistic feel and nostalgic mood but went overboard to the 10th power at least. The only positive to this experience was that I didn't waste $60 taking my family to the theater to see it.
B0018D4SHY|5.0|Little Richard was a true originator.  So many great early rock tunes that are STILL timeless.  A MUST HAVE for any early rocker's collection.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Had a blast playing it and I don't hunt in real life . Would tell all my friends to play this hi
B00AP9RQE4|4.0|I rated &#34;Captain Vorpatril's Alliance&#34; 4 out of 5 stars due to the feeling that loose ends are being tied up. Miles Vorkisigan has moved off stage, following his parents into off-planet obscurity, and I was hoping that Ivan might get a few titles in his own right out of Miles' shadow. The Jackson Whole connection of this book holds the potential for revisiting Lord Mark, but my overall impression was a swan song.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works amazing if you have an android phone and like Netflix.  The setup is simple and it just works.  Seems to do a good job of caching.
B005VPRETE|5.0|This was the first purchase in the world of LEGO friends.  Easy to use, brought much joy and lots of good play times
B001AITGWE|5.0|A tense, riveting tale of a displaced white male aerospace worker who is already on the edge as the failure of his marriage and loss of his job finally push him off the emotional cliff.<br /><br />His trek through the mean streets of Los Angeles in an effort to reach the home of his estranged wife - and the things he does along the way - is the core of the film.  Really cool movie.
B008EL25LE|1.0|Internet access is required permission because Amzn wants to track how many times you use this app: Too bad too, because I actually like the app.<br />You can turn off internet after the first time you use it (for 15 days), and then you'll get a block saying the app is corrupt because Amazon wants you to check in.<br />I've been upside down with Amzn support about this- then suddenly they stopped replying and the case suddenly disappeared. Your $5.00 is better spent at the play store, then your game is yours with no requirement to \\"check in\\" every 15 days.

B009NY43NY|5.0|This book was so amazing I could barely put it down. I was so happy to see how much each chapter pulled us back into every book before.<br />I truly hope this isn't the end of the Sookie Stackhouse story, but if it is, I'm glad it ended this way. Happily ever after.

B0000AK7A8|5.0|I just had to buy this DVD although it had been ages since I took my daughter, then junior-high age, to see the movie. The story is one to which children and parents can relate, and the ghosts are not too scary, exhibiting the right mix of fright and comedy. The story also shows the common experiences and attitudes adolescents have in every century, and it is important for young people to be aware of these rites of passage. Cristina Ricci's character is touched when she learns about the tragedy that cut short the life of Casper, the young man whose spirit cannot rest or leave his childhood home. The ghostly encounter culminates in the sense of a dream coming true -- something from a fairy tale -- in the magical moment when she can see Casper and dance with him. I especially would recommend this film as a Halloween tradition for the entire family.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Loved this book... and all its references to 70's & 80's video game, computer, TV, and music culture.  Definitely a fun read.  Story is well written and easily enjoyable.  Although the basic premise of the story may be a little far fetched, it does not make the book any less enjoyable.

B005LAJ1O0|5.0|AMERICAN HORROR STORY<br />SEASON 1<br /><br />When this show was first announced I very excited to see what it was all about. I liked the cast for it and eventually when the teasers were released I was all about it. I have always been a big horror fan and like most I am all about a good ghost story, especially a series. This is the first season of the show that would eventually be named \\"Murder house\\" for obvious reasons. I am happy to announce that this show was great as was the next season as is the current one now.<br /><br />The first season is all about a family of three who move into an old house, a house with history and guests who don't want to leave. Father Ben, wife Vivien and daughter Violet are trying t start over in life after a series of setbacks. Setbacks such as Vivien giving birth to a stillborn baby as well as her husband cheating on her with one of his students, who may not be completely out of the picture. All seems well enough until they hear the stories of their new house, \\"Murder House\\" as the locals call it. Things start up from there as previous residents of the home seem to not be able to leave. The reason being that some where up to twenty people have died in the house.<br /><br />This was an excellent show that kept me interested all the way to the very last episode. What made it even better was that I knew that I was going to get an ending since every season would be a different story. What better way to start out with than a haunted house tale. They way that the ghosts interact with the living in this show is great since they actually seem like real people who are still there. Now that is nothing new in this kind of story but the characters are very well written and acted as well.<br /><br />Dylan McDermott [husband], Connie Britton [wife], and Taissa Farmiga [daughter] are excellent as the family that moves in. each has their own problems to deal with and portray here and as the lead cast members the majority of the show falls on them. Still everyone here throughout the entire season is great from the smallest role to all the supporting roles. The writing, direction, and the way the show was shot all match the performances on every level.<br /><br />Now this show is not for everybody as some have called it a little risky, especially as far as the sexuality goes. I don't disagree with these people but none of it bothered me. For the most part I think it helped the story along, especially with McDermott's character. With this set you get an audio commentary along with many behind the scenes stuff. I do recommend this show to all horror or haunted house/ghost story fans. Season two is now out on DVD and Blu-Ray called \\"Asylum\\" and season three {Coven] is currently on TV.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Either you're a fan of the trilogy, or you hate it, (or you haven't seen it). This is a great mind-bending adventure, anyway you cut it. But to see it in HD is freaking incredible. Trade in or give away those tired ol' Low-Res DVDs (What're those?) and get this set. The extras are great.<br /><br />DON'T dodge this, or the Train Man will get you!
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|It is a fantastically interesting story that grips you.  You never want to stop watching it.  The characters and the costumes are great.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Anyone who likes music will appreciate this film. David Grohl is a great musician, but who knew he could direct?<br /><br />Sound City showcases, with historical video and images as well as new interviews, many of the big name bands who got their start at this grungy little recording studio in Southern California. At times funny, many times poignant, but all the time amazing, it tracks the lifespan of Sound City from its origins to it's final demise...and beyond!...<br /><br />Watch it; you won't regret it.<br /><br />All hail Rupert Neve!

B004GHNIRK|3.0|Enjoyed the play and movie so I wanted to read the book.  It is thousands of pages into the book before you see any resemblence to the play.  Long and drawn out.  Hard to maintain attention even as an avid reader.  I don't know if I will ever finish it!
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|Not all the songs are great, but most of them are, and the songs that are great are superlative. Seriously. I mean, top notch, fantastic, affecting, memorable, ect. Easily ranks among his best solo work. Music lovers should take note, this is a classic album.<br /><br />I'm not as enamored of \\"Early Days\\" as most people seem to be. I'm glad they like it, and I fully admit it isn't a bad song at all and it is very interesting. As Paul has said before, his past is ever present, so a song from a musical legend like him that honestly goes back and focuses specifically on his formative days with his equally legendary partner John Lennon, isn't unwelcome or unexpected at all. To me, it's just a little bit too obvious and on the nose, in my personal opinion.<br /><br />\\"Hosanna\\" and \\"Scared\\" don't do much for me either, but I'm just not naturally fond of slow ballads in general. They're okay, but not among my favorites. The other two semi-weak songs are \\"I Can Bet\\" and \\"Looking At Her\\", but those two are more than listenable because they go to some weird, unexpected places and benefit from creative production (as does the whole album.)<br /><br />The two deluxe edition songs \\"Turned Out\\" and \\"Get Me Out Of Here\\" are inessential, I think. The Japanese only Fireman-esque \\"Struggle\\" is more experimental and is the best of all the \\"bonus\\" tracks.<br /><br />Now that the hipster criticism is out of the way, the remaining eight tracks on \\"NEW\\" are phenomenal, and they actually get better with relistens. The songs and the production are deep. It's nutty how good these songs are.<br /><br />You can skip the rest of this review because it's really just an exercise in finding as many ways as I can to praise the rest of this album.<br /><br />\\"Save Me\\" rides the edge of pop and grungy, funky rock perfectly. It's a great album opener.<br /><br />\\"Alligator\\" is so weird and diverse. I think it's spectacular. It's astounding that a song can have so many facets. It's hard to put this onein a specific genre. I love the drastic changes and the way they contrast so starkly with the other sections of the song. A unique, unusual track.<br /><br />At first blush, the main riff of \\"On My Way To Work\\" sounds like it might have the potential to be annoying, but it turns out to be a fantastic song. Very affecting and multi-layered.<br /><br />\\"Queenie Eye\\" is a Beatles reference done right (\\"O U T spells out\\" is a callback to their holiday single \\"Christmastime Is Here Again\\".) \\"Queenie Eye\\" is so freaking good, it's like honey pouring from the speakers. I mean, in a just world it would be a smash hit single. And again it has really drastic and unexpected changes in style and tone, but like an amazing magic trick, it all manages to hold together and sound natural.<br /><br />I wasn't really impressed by \\"New\\" the first time I heard it. It sounded too reminiscent of \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\" to me. Maybe hearing it on better speakers helps, or maybe it's hearing it a few more times, but now I realize how utterly awesome it is if you judge it on its own terms. A really wonderful, positive energy song. It's easy to throw around the word \\"genius\\", but this song makes a pretty good case for coming close. The little reprise at the end is so excellent.<br /><br />\\"Appreciate\\" is the kind of funky rock I love best from Paul McCartney, and this satisfied completely and utterly. He used to use songs like these as bonus tracks, and I'm glad he put such a cool track on an album. It's an incredible dance song that makes you want to shake your groove thing.<br /><br />\\"Everybody Out There\\" is so completely intense and sincere. Amazing songwriting that that swings and changes up sound throughout. This song can bring chills. Really top notch. Great production too. Gets better with every listen.<br /><br />\\"Road\\" is another winner, a dark, fascinating song that sounds like nothing else I've heard. Mesmerizing and marvelous, menacing and majestic... I love this song. It's almost transcendent. Where did this one come from? A+ is too low. I can't say enough about how excellent this track is.<br /><br />And about the production I mentioned at the top of the review: It cannot be stressed enough that the creative production choices make the lesser songs interesting, but with the good songs it really pushes it all to the next level. The four producers really bring a lot of diverse elements that make each track very special. And any potentially Beatles-esque touches are done tastefully and with style.<br /><br />Nothing here sounds stressed, faked or forced, it all sounds fresh, vital and inspired. It's stunningly complex, yet sounds perfectly effortless, as if the music was plucked out of the air. A great album, a true treat.

B009JZSC9S|4.0|I've been a fan of this show since its first season and would have given it five stars before, but find it suffering a bit by all the side stories of the secondary characters.  It seems to be moving off point.  When it sticks to the legal issues it is compelling, but when it focuses on the side character issues it becomes less interesting, off the main track, and more soap opery. I still like the main characters and find them believable.
B001QB5S3G|5.0|I enjoyed the tortured soul played by Deniro, as it represents what most people who have committed deep sins feel. I also respected the passion of the Jesuit priest and his faith to God and the people.
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|So I'm a guy and this movie has monsters and robots. This movie rocks.  End of review!<br /><br />Story plot was pretty good, reminded me of a few Japanese anime put together into a movie.  Any Japanese anime turned into a movie is always graphical and fun to watch, and this is definitely no different.  When you are watching this movie, watch it with the attitude of this should be a fun ride rather than must analyze every little detail.  If you like analyzing every little detail, I would still recommend to watch this because you'll forget you are analyzing the movie.

B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Great story about a family's struggle and victory over almost unbeatable odds. I really like that this movie is based on a real family's experiences.  I wouldn't watch it with young children; there are some pretty tense parts, and scenes of things you would expect to see after a tsunami decimates the area it strikes. Very good movie!!

B00FFHG6KQ|3.0|For the price, I would expect the game to be more polished.<br /><br />Its a mobile game, using an on-screen d-pad is just a waste. They should've taken advantage of a touch screen and put more focus into 1-touch controls. There is no way to pull of dribble moves, they wasted the swipe motion on passing when you can already pass by tapping on a teammate. Should have had swiping gestures assigned to various dribble moves. Tap on an open space to have your player move in that direction. Swipe up near the basket to attempt a layup/dunk. These are just ideas that would've improved the controls.<br /><br />The only other complaint I have are a few minor annoying bugs like the instant replay and backcourt violation.<br /><br />I like the game, but the price is too high. At least when I think about how much more polished a game like Madden is which was free.

B00BCCE3VM|5.0|DG waited an inordinately long time to release Jan Lisiecki's second CD on this side of the Atlantic, which makes me wonder if their publicity arm might not be a bit wary. Their attempt to promote the Austrian prize-winner Ingolf Wunder hasn't been notably successful, and Lisiecki, as promoted on CBS's \\"60 Minutes,\\" has earned most of his publicity for being a wunderkind, always a tricky path to follow. I wasn't impressed by his modest debut CD of two Mozart piano concertos. The follow-up is much better and displays his artistic range and technical prowess more fully. The good news for him is that he has been engaged at a high level in the world's leading concert halls and recognized by accomplished musicians (all of this is detailed in Lisiecki's Wikipedia entry).<br /><br />Lisiecki took both sets of Chopin Etudes Op. 10 and Op. 25 on tour this year, which made for an exhausting experience for the audience. These are among the least ingratiating pieces to present in their entirety, because as beautiful as each etude is, the air of academic exercises still hangs over them and grows tedious if the pianist offers every single one. On the other hand, being exercises, they allow us to judge a performer's complete range of technique. Lisiecki goes a step further by infusing the entire performance with youthful zest and sparkle.<br /><br />He easily passes the test for artistry; his reputation for being musically mature beyond his years is well deserved. On the present scene Lisiecki's leading rivals for uncanny early development are probably the Russian Daniil Trifonov and the Englishman Benjamin Grosvenor.  All are jaw-dropping technicians, and if Lisiecki runs third at the moment (as I hear it), we're speaking of a rarefied group. I think there's no danger that his talent will burn out; he's well on his way to becoming an established major pianist. As for the technical demands of the Etudes, I think that's only to be judged reliably by professional pianists. To me, Lisiecki sounds as secure here as he did in concert when I heard this program on tour. Perhaps the left hand gets a bit thumpy at times, but there's no problem with his overall sensitivity to Chopin.<br /><br />Comparisons? Among complete sets, which aren't that common from the greatest pianists, I own only Pollini, playing on an ugly, clattery instrument (DG). Sampling a handful of the popular named etudes (Revolutionary, Butterfly Wings, Winter Wind, etc.), I found it hard to prefer Pollini, who recorded these pieces as a mature artist,  over the 18-year-old Lisiecki. At times Pollini shows more panache, while at other times Lisiecki doesn't create as much atmosphere. But even to make such a comparison indicates that DG may have found a successor to their most famous and enduring Chopinist, taking into account that they have another young marvel in Rafal Blechacz, who is a decade older.siecki sounds as secure here as he did in concert when I heard this program on tour.

It has humor in it compliments of &#34;The Mouse&#34; and a beautiful love story between Isabeau and Etienne, although a bit tragic.

B00CH87HF4|3.0|The game keeps me interested with plenty of quests, multi-player action and PvP.  Would give this game a 5 if it weren't for the absolute non-existent customer service.  The few minor glitches are annoying, and would be a complete non issue if at least one human being would acknowledge my requests.<br />There's a minor glitch with merging gems that takes up space in your inventory, which you have to buy extra spots with gems.  So when you have these &quot;invisible&quot; gems, you're losing inventory spots.  I spent 500 Amazon bucks on this game so I asked for a little compensation......no response.  Twice!<br />Next, the game crashed on me and would never reopen.  When I reinstalled the game, all my progress AND all my purchased gems disappeared.  Wrote to cs, again with no response.<br />I still play the game because it's that interesting and fun, but it is bittersweet.

B002V092B0|5.0|A friend recommended My Stroke of Insight, and I was intrigued. I downloaded it on my Kindle and read it in a day. It was absorbing from two points of view. Firstly, it was fascinating to be shown how the different areas of the brain assist one's thinking, and how one is affected by damage to certain sections. Secondly, Jill Bolte Taylor shared the spiritual insight that her stroke had afforded her, and I found this refreshing for my own spirituality. Also very valuable was the educational dimension about the unfolding of a stroke, and the exploration of the possibility of organ donation. Altogether a very worthwhile book!

B00E3IZIM0|5.0|The movie surprised me so much in 2D I had to see it in IMAX 3D.  The mastering of this disc is almost as good as seeing it in IMAX.  OK, that's a strech but you get your own seat, can pause it, no line for food...  If you haven't seen it this movie is like a modern Godzilla vs Johnny Sokko.  Don't know who they are, Google it.  It takes classic Japanese movie and anime themes and gives them to you in a good story, very well made.  John Knoll from ILM was involved so you know you're getting something good.  The 3D is one of the best 3D discs I own.  The color and picture are better than when I saw it in IMAX and much better than 2D.  If you have 3D I hope you enjoy this as much I as do.  I watched of my digital copy on my iPhone and it looks good there too.  You also get SD and HD options from Flixter.  I suggest this movie for anyone loving fun, exiciting, sci-fi type movies.

Her talent for removing energy blocks to wealth are amazing through her use of EFT.<br />I am grateful to Margaret for this book which I trust will assist readers to move though the old paradigm of fear, scarcity and lack when it comes to money. Tapping moves old stale energy out of the body so that new fresh abundant energy can come in. It has been said that; \\"as we release the past, we allow the new and the fresh and the vital to enter.\\" Tapping is a very effective tool to achieve this. Thank you Margaret. I love and appreciate who you are.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My 10 year old son and I read this book at bedtime. We talked a lot about the different issues that Auggie faced and how it made him feel.  It really sparked some deep and thoughtful conversations.  My son really wanted to meet Auggie and when I asked what would you say if he were a real boy and you got to meet him?  He said &#34;well first i would look right in his eyes not away or down ( unless he was wearing really cool sneakers and then i would tell him i liked his sneakers so he wouldn't think that I looked away on purpose) and then I would ask him if he would be my friend.
B00C5R7F8G|1.0|Book is like a term paper half the book is reference notes not clear what the author was trying to prove i worked with nuclear weapons for a number of years and our weapons were secured and we never had an accident  im over rating this book with one star
B006LSZECO|3.0|For me, it was an average read. It wasn't the kind of book I couldn't put down because I was so involved with characters. It was predictable. I did not care for the ending. It was okay.
B007N8RULO|2.0|After using game and turning off Kindle, it completely locks up and you need to completely reboot. Game was ok, but not worth it with the lockups.
B00F1RR3Y8|1.0|The game does not give information on how to play it when the game first load up where is the hint button
B008DM4OTA|1.0|IT FROZE MY KINDLES AND IT ALWAYS RAN THE BATTERY DOWN REALLY BAD LIKE 100 PERSENT IT IS STUPID LITTLE S*** THERE DONT GET IT ITS A JOKE ITS NOT WORTH PAYING ANYTHING STUPID STUFF THERE  KIDS LIKE IT BUT IM 13 AND I HATE THIS WACKY STUPID GAME MY LITTLE BROTHER LOVES IT SO I GOT IT AND IT WONT UNINSTALL
B00F7YHDWC|1.0|not quite as fun as I thought it would be. Good for a quick chuckle, but I uninstalled the app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a good game to play because it is fun to play but they should have less expensive stuff or some free stuff.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|this is a facebook client , it is possible to do everything like if you are using in you pc
B007Z9RS22|1.0|The opening is very funny but then it turns out to be unrealistic and rediculous. There are good ideas in the movie and I like the intention to descibe a hectic character who probably has some desire for a calmer, more intensive life and real love changing. I just can't believe that a character like Reeves in this movie would react like this. Therons Character is most of the time unappealing and nerving.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|it is a calculator, the only problem is the merchant announcers<br />but it is ok to free apps<br />if you don`t have any calc - this is a good sollution
B0058S0OMS|3.0|This Blu-ray is worth it for the inclusion of &#34;Terror In the Aisles,&#34; but compared to another Halloween II release, this one is short on extras.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I like very much this apps, it is like a electronic magazine, but you can choose what do you want read.
B0035LMTZA|5.0|Wahlberg is a great actor. I always enjoy his movies. This has the perfect mix of action and also comedy.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|one star less because it just wasn't long enough,great game though,not too difficult to work out!<br /><br />Can't wait for more!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I don't often buy into the hype of a bestseller so I went in with low expectations but I enjoyed it. I'm not bothered by the ending either.
B0051ANPZQ|3.0|Book begins with interesting idea with improbable conclusion. Idea of different voices adds nothing but to confirm comments by other characters.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|This was a very well thought out and executed game.  Storyline was also great along with the graphics.  Keep it up!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very simple outline, easy to use and enjoy. Fun game, simple time passer and time waster. I would recommend for all .
B00DGGIXS6|2.0|Why did Cher put out a dance album? She's so much better than this. And the auto tone....why? It doesn't sound like her, and if she's trying to make her voice sound better using this technology...it didn't work. I know singers voices change as they mature, but to use auto tone to correct it is awful. I'm sure she still has the vocal chops. I still love Cher, glamorous to the max, but please...no auto tone!!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I HAVE NOT SEEN THIS MOVIE IN A WHILE, BUT I REMEMBER IT BEING GOOD WITH A LOT OF ACTION. CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IT!
B0035HKWM6|4.0|A great little time capsule to Jim Carrey's heyday; complete with solid writing, some effective foreshadowing, a solid sense of humor and appreciation for classic cartoons, a very catchy dance number, and Cameron Diaz's debut (not to mention she's not been that curvy and hot in years). Not perfect, but more than worth a watch.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST PICTURES I HAVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME. SANDRA BULLOCK IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE STARS , HER PART JUST TOOK THIS PICTURE OVER THE TOP!!
B003O86FMW|4.0|It's a good, easy read.  Suzanne Collins is a good story teller but, of course, some of the suspense is taken away because you know there is a sequel.
1582701709|5.0|The Secret works.<br />What one thinks about, one brings about. What one uses to think with is, for one, language.

B000MAH5O2|5.0|This book has a lot to offer.  I enjoyed reading and learning more about the times of events and Barack Obama's political life.  This book commented on some of the very things that we have had to endure recently.  Nice read...strongly recommend this book!!!
0143122061|4.0|In Civilization, Niall Ferguson draws upon his rich and diverse bank of intellectual capital to provide some good answers to the fundamental question implicitly embedded in the History of the World since 1492 - namely, why did the West come to so thoroughly dominate the rest of the world (at least up until the end of World War II) ?<br /><br />This book is filled with colorful anecdotes about interesting people and important events from across the globe. Ranging freely over a period of several centuries, Ferguson uses these interwoven stories to construct his argument that Western Civilization serendipitously developed six institutional advantages at a time when older, initially bigger and more powerful civilizations were undergoing a period of stagnation and decline.<br /><br />These six institutional bedrocks (or`Killer Apps') of Western Civilization are identified as:<br /><br />1. Competition<br />2. Science<br />3. Property Rights<br />4. Medicine<br />5. The Consumer Society<br />6. The Work Ethic<br /><br />In Ferguson's view, it is better to look at institutional structures rather than cultural tendencies, geography, or ethnicity to explain significant material divergences between groups. He quite effectively highlights the recent historical examples of how East and West Germany, and North and South Korea, so quickly and starkly diverged in material terms, despite their cultural and ethnic affinities, based solely on differences in their governmental institutions.<br /><br />The book is not flawless; there are times when the narrative appears to wander and it is not clear where the author is going with a particular point.<br /><br />In the concluding chapter, Mr. Ferguson highlights how non-western societies have now successfully downloaded at least some of Western Civ's' Killer Apps. He  sees an emergent China as being more of a problem for the West than an aggressive, expansionist Islam; he may be making the wrong call there.<br /><br />More plausibly, hedescribes our current exposures to economic and military disaster as being a set of `complex systems', subject to nonlinear proliferation with minimal advance notice but with potentially devastating results.  In the end, Ferguson redeems himself by making it clear he believes that, to the extent Western Civilization actually is at risk, our worst enemy is our own pusillanimous, narcissistic, ignorant selves.<br /><br />If any of these matters are of interest to you, I strongly recommend you read this book.
B001MSMULG|4.0|This was my first read by Daniel Silva and I was quite pleased.  I will read more of his books for sure!!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I use this app every night and just love it! Easily customizable a d plenty of choices available. Easy to set up or change as well. My kids use it as well.
1451695195|5.0|I loved the truth of it.  Believed every word of it. Gave me Goose Bumps, so very special to read. God Bless this man ror what he had to endure. I am a Liver Transplant, I wish I could have had such an experience like His.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Moves quickly, and is original in plot and character development - definitely a good read!  I will read more from these authors.
B003U69IX6|5.0|It was great to watch a movie without the added unnecessary foul language.  It was action packed and we even stayed up late to finish watching it.  Watch it, you will not regret it.
B00BUVLQNI|5.0|I got these for my Mom and have borrowed them since. Great to watch and very speedy and just what was ordered

B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I have to admit--when I first saw this game--I thought it was made more for children--so I gave it some thought and decided to download this--been playing it for awhile--I love the mystery plants--so fun to see what fish appears she the plant is done--I highly recommend this!!!
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|Variety of levels  make this game really fun. I love the space levels. The different gravity on the different planets was a blast.
B004V71CYQ|4.0|It was really awesome. The FX on the movie even though it is really old, are amazing. Arcades are great.
B00992CF6W|5.0|0.8.0 is NEAR its going to be BIG! It's bringing carrots potatoes and logs that are sideways plus minecarts rails and colored wood planks! YAY! :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this is awesome<br />Best game I have ever played<br />When I got it played and played and played<br />Total addict<br />Got visions totally worth the money<br />GET LT
B0065FFMR0|5.0|I was sick for a few days and needed something to entertain myself. I stumbled upon this show on Netflix and I'm glad I did! I watched the whole season in one day! It's about this family who moves to the west coast from the east coast. They find this house that's priced way below its value and once they move in they find out why. It's called the \\"murder house\\" by the locals and is even on a haunted tour. The episodes start off in the past with the previous owners who have lived and died in the house then goes back to present day to the new owners. It really keeps you on your toes throughout the whole season. It's a must watch! I highly recommend it!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved this book as I love all of Kings books.  I liked the way the book ended too. I hope he is writing more novels.
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|Gives me a snapshot of my interests without all the ads easy to change interest items with on time prices
B00594XOZU|5.0|i think this app is good for kids and adults and  and it is coooool all my friends have one
1616960922|5.0|This short story packs a lot in about 170 pages.  The main character, Shai finds herself in a life or death situation when she is caught performing her craft as a Forger of art.  Shai, who lives her life lying and manipulating, gradually forms an alliance with a member of the Emperor's court that saves her life.  Shai must be honest and genuine in order to do so.  The Emperor's Soul is a study of morality.  Original art and fine possessions are a symbol of status and greed.  Being a Forger is considered an abomination and evil. As with art, the human soul can also be corrupted by power and greed.  So, what is real and what is fake?  That is what this short story is all about.  When given the chance, \\"do better this time\\".  If you can do that, whatever you have in life can be authentic and your own.<br />This book reminded me a little bit of 1,000 and One Nights.  I loved it!
B00F57VFXO|1.0|Do not waste your money on this dribble. It is obviously written to simulate a James Bond mission but fails miserably.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|Great show! The characters were fun to follow, and the show provided a nice escape to a small town world.
0767827791|5.0|This is a wonderful movie. I love watching it over and over.<br />It makes me feel good.  I'm very satisfied with my purchase.<br />  Thank you,<br />  Bonnie Bronson
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good game<br /> Worth getting and spending time on. So on and so forth.<br />Very interesting and plenty of activities.<br />Really great game!
B00BAXFAOW|1.0|The good - as usual Malcolm Gladwell had an interesting premise.<br /><br />The bad - almost everything else about the book.  Gladwell has built a solid career observing and synthesizing commonalities in our world.  In past books, he has found interesting and pertinent examples to illustrate his premise.  Tipping points for significant change,  people willing to devote 10000 hours striving for perfection, and the hidden ordinary.  All entertaining and often surprising topics for books.<br /><br />What Gladwell masterfully achieved in previous books was finding relevant, interesting examples.  In David and Goliath he finds neither.  The first chapter about David's unlikely defeat of Goliath establishes the premise for the book - the underdog is often not the underdog.  The remaining chapters unsuccessfully attempt to relate this premise to diverse challenges all around us - dyslexia, our educational system, strategies for basketball.  I found his efforts to further his premise to be forced and, in many cases, unsupported by facts.  Observing interesting similarities does not lead to a cause-and-effect conclusion.  One or two anecdotal examples do not make a scientific discovery.  An author in search of his next book does not make for compelling reading.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I really used Netflix since purchasing this item.  Super easy to get it up and running.  The only downside is having to use my computer or phone as the remote as I often have to enter a password after the device times out and goes into sleep mode.  But that is a minor annoyance compared to the ease of use of this device
B002LLE3PY|5.0|King Crimson's Lizard, remastered an remixed by Steven Wilson is like an ancient picture book found, cleaned and refreshed, allowing the original intricate details and bright colors to reappear. The cover art sets the stage - disparate fantastical and elaborite scenes. Here circus performers, there the Beatles, over there, a young prince riding his horse at night alongside death.<br /><br />Cirkus sets the stage - nonsense poetry more or less giving snapshots of a nightmare circus, with occasional plunges into heavy electronic orchestrations.<br />Indoor Games and Happy Family are both jaunty tunes with absurd lyrics but sinister undertones about domestic disharmony. Both suggest troubles in someone's waking life - Indoor Games relating to home, Happy Family about the opposite, an obscure and absurd song allegedly about the Beatles' breakup, but which could represent any collegial disharmony.<br />Lady of the Dancing Water in contrast is a beautiful image of a fairy tale fantasy, pure and sweet, wistful and sad in the end.<br />Lizard, the title track is a more epic fairy tale, in three parts, introducing a young prince, his travels, and a battle, all sung by a youthful sounding Jon Anderson of Yes, going through a range of emotions and sound-styles.<br /><br />This is music that starts out being jarring and off putting, but repeated listening reveals complex rhythms and harmonies.
B00B2G33QE|1.0|This is literally the worst show I have ever watched. The characters consistently make the wrong choice in every situation they are faced with. For some reason, experienced and highly trained FBI agents are unable to figure out anything, ever. The acting is horrible and the characters are ultimately uninteresting. Every \\"shocking\\" event is highly predictable and barely exciting at all.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|I like this one so much, I bought two.<br />It has a nice solid finish and feels well made. Coiled cord is a must for the car (for me). And an actual \\"made for iPhone\\" product so the lightning connector is legit.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|If you pay 14.99 for a stylus at your local Wal-Mart or Target, where I shop most, you would have one tip. The AmazonBasics Multi-Tip lets you choose a size that is comfortable for what you're doing.
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|Don't take this book too seriously. Nice way to pass a long flight or read on the beach. An eccentric geneticist looks for love in all the wrong places. Very entertaining would recommend.
B00BXDOSXS|5.0|First time user and really liked how well the picture looked.  The color was great.  I look forward to watching more shows with this app.
B0091REZMW|3.0|This game is ok not bad my daughter play with it lol over all the game is ok<br />Bla Laos
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is a brilliant book about secrets and flawed characters. It's very real and very human - if you like your fiction characters to always behave impeccably then don't read this. If you like to read about 'real' people who don't always act as society would imagine they should (after all, we all are only human and even good people can be tempted into making bad choices) then this is absolutely a must-read. Beautifully written and a compelling read from start to finish - and so lovely to read about 'real' people as in [[ASIN:B00E4VC70W Weak at the Knees]] - when it comes to love and life, things can so often get messy, so it's great to read fiction that portrays the angst of very human situations.
B004VD3YIM|5.0|Works great and unlike the others it keeps working great. It does take some practice but save your head ache and get the pro
B006LSZECO|4.0|My husband and various other friends told me I had to read Gone Girl, and they were right. I loved it - it was a brilliantly-crafted thriller that starts with a bang and carries on that way (although the ending isn't as good as the beginning) weaving in dark histories and a great sense of intrigue. Readers who like their thrillers laced with romance might also enjoy [[ASIN:B009Y8AOE6 LOVER IN LAW]].
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey is amazing! She really nails it in this book. I think any woman with a functioning brain should read this book. It just gives good life advice in a funny way. Her perspective is so down to earth and real.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|This movie was excellent from start to finish. Real and heart felt with a dose of levity appropriately sprinkled throughout. Beautifully acted, cast perfectly.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|In the beginning, I was getting a headache because events kept repeating. Then bits of new information began to come in to play. Christine's amnesia and what was happening to her sucked me in and I couldn't put the book down. Who was Ben? What happened to Adam? Who was Nash? What happened to Christine? These are just some of the questions that I needed answered. Startling revelations come out in the end.........
B00571F26Y|4.0|Its amazing what we dont know... even when its looking us in the face. I found this book fascinating and for the most part very well written. Each claim is well presented and thoroughly based and the scariest part is that it makes perfect sense! I highly recommend this book for anyone who is truly interested in healthy nutrition and who has an open mind enough to consider possibilities that are the exact opposite of what we have been taught to accept as fact.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love it .it will really makes you think like a spy or an investigator or an agent.you should have patience because sometimes clues are really hard to find.you can find some of it where you least expect it.
0143119680|4.0|Interesting characters you want to meet.  The author takes you along with her in every place and moment.<br />Good twists.  Good plot threads.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Loved the story being told from the dog's perspective.  Wonderful message of working through people who try to hurt you and in spite of it, doing the right thing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter loves this game. She is always asking to take care of her horse. The graphics are real enough that when she posted a picture of the horse on Facebook a friend asked me if she had gotten a real horse.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|An incredibly well told story about the men who make America what it is.  I choked up at the end, feeling like I was almost a part of the story.  Amazing read
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the show and can't wait for season 4! Sometimes it's more dramatic than I'd like though and I can see why some people call it a costume drama soap opera.
0399255370|5.0|This book is very creative.  It can be enjoyed by all ages and especially those who loved their coloring experiences in grade school.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|The story goes back and forth. I only read 1 chapter at a time,doesn't keep my interest. I'm typing three more words.
B00B2JSRAS|2.0|The book was interesting to read. But when I tried the experiments, they didn't work. The fact that someone wrote a book about these experiments and a publishing company actually published this book suggests that the experiments will work. But the whole thing is a sham. They don't work at all.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Great movie about the human spirit. A little graphic for younger viewers in certain scenes, but an amazing overall story.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|Beautifully shot, it was great on the big screen-couldn't pass it up when the price dropped this low. Looks fantastic on a big screen HD. Well done.
B008I43DYU|5.0|I found that the Calculator Pro is an excellent app that is very user friendly and is easy to read.Very good app.
B002AFX52S|5.0|Amazing movie, crazy colors, huge numbers in battle scenes. Not the first movie I would start someone on in the Japanese Samurai experience. See seven Samurai and others before taking on this one.
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|While I don't personally play it, my grandsons (age 7 and 9) fight for kindle time so it must be great.
B008JFUTUY|5.0|The question one keeps asking throughout this is; How did this guy not make it? Amazing Documentary/movie. So good in fact I went and ordered the sound track.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Great for keeping time on the go. Waking up to any music you choose. A great hotel treat compared to hotel clocks and wake up calls.
B00AHTYGRW|4.0|Great movie, always enjoy movies based on actual events. However Hollywood just can't seem to give up either car chases or the last minute crisis where either a bomb is going to go off or something else happens in the last few seconds-same here. Don't want to spoil it but things start to fall apart at the very end and it looks like the plan will fail...from what I have read on the actual event nothing of the sort happened. But still a good movie. The price was cheap when I bought it and got in on Blu-ray too-which made it nice.
B00F91H15W|2.0|The plot was uninteresting and I read about kids doing stupid things in the news all the time. Not the worst movie but this was no 'lost in translation'. Maybe Bill Murray should have played the male lead and I would have enjoyed it more.
B00CDTSQZW|5.0|Loved the show on T.V. Now owning it is fantastic. Great story line. You can't beat the price-especially on Blu-ray- what's that break down to something like $2.50 an episode? Looking forward to the next season...
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Had to buy this season because it wasnt free and I just started watching it from the beginning .Great show and I love Amazon.
B007PVHAN2|4.0|I know many people who completely love Marley. I enjoy his music but wanted to know a little more about the man. Many children from different women-while married to others, drugs-of course, complicated, a child in some ways. Still like the music, understand it a little better-not a huge fan of the person however. Great seeing some of the places he lived, Jamaica. over all-I would see if I could get this at a very low price before buying.
B001RHOJSE|5.0|I read the book in 1963, and reread now after watching the movie Hannah Arendt. My reaction this time is much more positive and I now believe, contrary to my thoughts in 1963, Arendt was right with het thoughts. It's a wonderful reading of Arendt's philosophy.
B008JFUR10|4.0|I giving it four stars for the action, for story line two. I did enjoy the movie the actors so so, If you are an action fan like me you will love it.  What I don't understand they knew how big &#34;what you would call them things&#34; why didn't they build the robots bigger, that don't make sense. compared to the monsters the robots were toys.
B004OC07GM|4.0|Excellent read, read this before the Search for Survival<br />Some of the examples are older and have played out since the book was written
B00F56AZK4|1.0|I don't like it when they say it will b e free and then when you go to use it you have to pay to pick out what you want.
1582701709|4.0|This book is the beginning! For anyone that wants to really open their mind and spirit, Start here and then don't stop! There is so much out there to understand that you were never told as you grew up. These things are here for you to start a new journey in life.
1452126607|5.0|I am not a cat lover - but this really cracked me up! I will look for 2015 for sure.
1451673442|4.0|This is the kind of book that will open you mind even further and let you understand that there is no limits as to what we are able to do with our lives.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I believe the percentage of my friends NOT using facebook is inversely proportionate the number of people playing with Ataris.
1439181780|4.0|This is the kind of book that will open you mind even further and let you understand that there is no limits as to what we are able to do with our lives. It gives you a sense of being who you truly can be in life.
B00BDAP66E|5.0|I have this app on my phone and it may be easier to take and upload photos from there, but having the app on my Kindle allows me to view and manage the pages better.
B005XUC398|2.0|The movie was pretty boring most of the way the through. Like watching a really long board room meeting.<br />I was not a fan.
B0073COMUW|5.0|Great bulb, very bright!  I replaced my home with LED bulbs and the price was cheaper than the box stores.  My order was delivered on time and if you plan to make the switch to LED bulbs than these are the ones.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Definitly am glad I got this app. Helps me kept out the bad and keep the rest. Reminds me to do this si I dont lose degices to stupid viruses. Definite must have.
B00447L4JG|2.0|My seven year old really wanted this movie so I got it for her for Christmas. She didn't like it at all....it really creeped her out. I guess she was too young?
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I am almost to level 200.  too much time on my hands? no. I play anytime I can steal 5 minutes.  you can play anytime,  anywhere.<br />even when you r watching Tv. if anyone knows what u do after u complete the horse frenzy please post it.
B002U3CCKQ|3.0|I liked Gone Girl even though the characters were unlikeable, because Gillian Flynn writes so well.<br />However, this book is so dark, so far beyond a glimmer of light, that I would hesitate to recommend it to anyone. I actually forced myself to read a chapter a day, just to get to the end, in the vain hope that the ending would be worth it. Well, it was not!<br />Although the ending answered your questions, and had a somewhat unexpected twist, it remained unsatisfactory.<br />I will not risk reading this author again. I gained nothing from this reading, not enlightenment,nor understanding or empathy.<br />The 3 stars are for the deft writing.
B00FDSUJ0A|4.0|A slight change from previous ventures, but still absolutely just as beautiful, creative, and catchy. A true joy from start to finish.
B00006YXEK|5.0|Excellent music and lyrics by George.  It really shows that he was one of the best in music.  He was one of the greats.
B00F35BV64|5.0|A worthy sequel! The trailers made me worry that J.J. Abrams had gone supernatural on us as he often does, or given in to the recent trend of noisy nonstop action in lieu of character development. Not so! The humor is there. The references to prior versions in the franchise so smooth as to not leave newbies hanging. Loved it!
B00EUS9JF0|3.0|This is difficult since I am a true Beatle and McCartney fan.  Some of the musical sounds are very unique and attention getting but overall the cd is a bit disappointing with some of the same vocal sounds coming from his previous cd's.  At first with some of the sounds I thought WOW but as the cd played on I sort of had to make myself stay with it.  Then after one listening I thought I would give it one more listen to hear if I missed anything but unfortunately I will probably stick it in the cd drawer until another time - perhaps Sir Paul has lost me with this one or perhaps my expectations were much higher.  I don't know what I was expecting but when I compare this cd to Harrson's Brainwashed - Mc Cartney let's me down and Harrison really shines.  One of the things on Mc Cartney's cd that seemed trite was the over use of extended sounds at the ends of the several songs.  It goes a bit overboard and the sounds aren't even ones that would make me think of what they might lead to unlike other Beatle/Mc Cartney trademark songs.  Some of the sounds are quite unique though - I must say, but the lyrics and tunes kind of left me flat.  Perhaps Sir Paul is not in touch with the plain folks anymore??  Don't know but this was difficult to write being the fan that I am of the man...

B000063DI9|5.0|I know that the tour was cancelled due to poor album sales, but, as an Iron Maiden fan, I love the music.<br /><br />As a concept album, many people may have preconceived notions, and decide to neglect this work.<br /><br />It is a very mature sound for Maiden, similar to Fear of the Dark.

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|A deep, caring and funny book. It has everything. I don't get the people who said they felt this book was for teens. I'm 28 and I enjoyed it so much. I felt like the dialogue was on point with how the teens I know today talk. I can't find anything wrong with this book besides feeling like the end was rushed a little bit.
B00DXP0QX0|4.0|Not my favorite of the albums I received. I like some of the songs others are just so-so. It was interesting to hear the original version of Maggie May that was only done once...I can see why. When they finally got it put together it of course has been my favorite of all time.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Even though this was a lengthy book, the story certainly kept you going! If I didn't have to go to work and sleep, I never would have put it down.  How in the world did Kate Morton think up this story line? It was a wonderful book and I'm so glad that our book club had chosen this book to read or I would have missed the pleasure of experiencing this novel.

B007PVHMCG|5.0|My son says this is his favorite set. He loves Minecraft and this is like a mini world from that game. He is 8 and put it all together. It took a little bit but he did it. I would say this is a good Lego set if your child loves Minecraft.
B00ARF93AQ|2.0|Too graphically violent and very simplistic story.. production quality was *very* good.. so if you like this kind of thing its probably great bit of mindless action.. (acting was very good for the material.. just not much material to work with here.) just not my cup of tea (and I don't mind violence!).
190949013X|5.0|This book is amazing. The characters are not only believable, but likable and charmingly flawed (i.e. like normal people). It's an amazing story about friendship that goes beyond just friends and the dilemmas faced by someone who feels too much but is afraid of losing their other half. It is an amazing read full of charm, whit, and humor. One of the few books that have actually brought me to tears. I love The Gravity Between Us and I'm sure everyone else will too.

B007W8S2MG|2.0|If you're not already onboard with this type of game, don't buy it. Tedious. Boring. Saturated with overly cute Japanese animation that, for me, ruins any attempt at a serious tone. I appreciate that I'm obviously not the target audience and that fans have much to cheer about.
B00881VLCE|1.0|This was lots of fun when I first got the ap. Now it shuts down and I lose my already started puzzles. It's so very frustrating. I think I'm going to delete the ap from my kindle.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I bought it to try it out, and see how it compared to Airplay etc. It works ok, lets me send any Chrome content to my TV, but it's flaky, and reports an error after 3-5 minutes, over and over. Netflix works well, so I think it's a Chrome Extension issue or something. I'll be selling it since the return period just expired.
B00FCR3JQS|4.0|i have loved the hony facebook site for a long time, liked nearly every single photo.... and yes, indeed, it does restore faith in humanity. the only issue is that i cannot read the book on my mac kindle app. and that would make the pics larger and better and makes me sad that i cannot do it. if that worked, - 5 stars. the people, the comments, the emotion that is so very evident from each subject - it is amazing. and to think that the artist came late to this and did not know he had this skill  until very recently - stunning and even a bit sad. my dad was born and raised in new york city, and i sent him the book. he said he knew the streets the pictures were taken on, and while he left to retire 20 years ago, it is the same sort of people he saw every day, that make manhattan the world treasure it is, that is shown so well in this book.<br /><br />buy it. you will not regret it.

Towards the end sometimes she would come back for a few minutes sometimes she would not. This film is once in a lifetime movie magic. It is so touching and really brings home the pain of Alzheimers. Both to the person afflicted and the family/caregiver. I did it all myself until my sweet Mum died. I am glad I did. I pretty much cry from start to finish when I watch this movie now.

There is nothing better than giant robots fighting giant monsters.

B008EL25LE|3.0|Other reviews have already summed the game up well. It has a storyline, nice graphics, though not a good quality voiceover, and compares well to others in the match3 sector, but it isn't so overwhelmingly sophisticated compared to others, including the predecessor, that it should need internet access. I'd rather have it download some more data on initializing. I play on a tablet and have no Wifi at home, so it's library or outdoors.<br />This isn't a huge gameworld, just a nice game, so why can't it work offline?<br /><br />UPDATE: after the first level, it did NOT demand internet to continue play though I don't know if this goes for the whole rest of the game. If this is so, then the initial demand for internet access is misleading and should be replaced by a demand for one time access to download more data.
B00544XKK4|5.0|You know, there are times when one reads a review and there is an amount of justified dissension, and then there are times when you read a review of something you own and it seems like an entirely different product. Point in case: Logitech speakers.<br /><br />To put it in simple terms these are NOT a pair of B&W Nautilus... they are a £10 pair of plastic speakers for a computer - so audiophiles back up and take leave of your self for a moment. If you are still reading please thing for a moment about what I have just said and then let's look at the product within those parameters.<br /><br />What you are geting for your tenner is in-fact remarkable; a sonic miracle no less. Image a few decades back being able to plug a SMALL pair of active speakers into your computer and get very good quality stereo - impossible! It would have required a whole setup and then some big boxes rigged to the wall and still you wouldn't have gotten much better than these - certainly not pound-for-pound. And believe me, when I say that, as I have always owned quality separates so I think I know what I am talking about here.<br /><br />These handle everything from Underworld through Chet Baker and Goldie to the outer realms of Dub, and yet these are nothing like a Bose Bass Canon... because they are not designed to be, but what they are and what they do is reproduce sound in a balanced way, with an excellent midrange, and, high-end, and a reasonable bass that obviously lacks punch. If you want thumping bass, again, you're reading the wrong review - drop the cash on the Bose Bass Canon, and if you want output buy the B&W Nautilus or a pair of room-sized speakers. But if you want perfectly acceptable stereo that will carry anything you care to run through them these can't be beaten.<br /><br />I play them on a MacBook Air and I set the volume on the computer at full and the volume on the speaker at half (straight up). I also set the equaliser on iTunes to `small speakers.' If you follow that I can bet you your tenner you won't be disappointed.I can bet you your tenner you won't be disappointed.

0446576220|4.0|Delivering Happiness is probably one of the most popular business books in 2013. I saw people reading it everywhere, especially in the plane. So, I decided to read it and it is pretty good. It is a very easy read with some good points.<br /><br />Delivering Happiness is the story of Tony Hsieh, who is the founder of Zappos and therefore it is also the story of Zappos. The book consists of three parts called 1) Profits, 2) Profits & Passion, and 3) Profits, Passion and Purpose.<br /><br />The first part (Profits) tells the early life of Tony growing up and always trying to make a profit out of everything he did. Most of his attempts as a child and teenager failed miserably, but some of them succeeded. After graduation, he worked a bit for Oracle and started a new dot com company called link exchange. He sold the company for a couple of million to Microsoft and reached his early  goal in life and began wondering what he should do next.<br /><br />The second part (Profits & Passion) he decided he likes to build a company and joins Zappos. He is basically the core investor in Zappos and his private money keeps the company alive. At the first years, it wasn't going very well until he changed the direction of the company to expand the choice of shoes. Finally the company took off and became one of the largest eCommerce sites and was eventually sold to Amazon.com. From the outside, Zappos became especially known for its customer service.<br /><br />The last part (Profits, Passion, and Purpose) is a fairly small part where Tony explains how Zappos changes from only focusing on Zappos to a larger purpose of also improving other companies. He researched a bit in &#34;happiness literature&#34; and comes to the conclusion that (unlike his early life focus) money and profits don't make people happy, but the passion and purpose of contributing to the world does. So, he makes creating and delivering happiness a motto for Zappos.<br /><br />The book is a very easy read. It is basically a sort-of autobiography of Tony and Zappos. Because of that, it does explain everything from one perspective, Tonys. Some reviewers complained about that, but then again, what can you expect from an autobiography. This book isn't a research on why Zappos in a successful company but is is Tony Shiehs perspective on why Zappos is an interesting company. And Tony is a pretty good story-teller which makes the book quite engaging and he does introduce some innovations in how companies are run that I loved. For example, offering people a bonus for leaving the company to check their commitment to the company is something I haven't heard done before.<br /><br />The book is a quick read, an interesting story and contains some useful insights. Yet, I wouldn't rate it as a 5 star book either. In the middle of the company, it became a bit too much &#34;promoting Zappos&#34; and the Zappos values (which I understand are important) got repeated a bit too often. Though the company does offer some innovation, it doesn't go as far as for example Richardo Semler with Maverick. So, all in all, a good an easy read.

B004UID2LC|1.0|Very frustrating app, it constantly freezes and plays the videos without seeing it at times. Especially when using the app as a distraction for the kids.
1607066017|5.0|The art is wonderful and the story twisty and engaging, the characters fun and involving. I immediately ordered volume two.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|The history of the time and place in which Jesus lived and taught was great. The story of the struggle between James the brother of Jesus and Paul was fascinating. However there was no discussion of Jesus's teaching that didn't fit the author's theme of Jesus as zealot. While I too think his message and work has been distorted and diluted by \\"Christianity\\", I think this author got lost debunking the fairy tale and missed what was central, eternal and \\"divine\\" about Jesus's message. So he never sees Christ. He should read \\"The Fruit Of Lips\\" by Eugene Rosenstock-Huessey
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So cool you need to get it is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo awesome to play have fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Fun so so so so cool so cool xxx!!!!!

B009LQKHIO|5.0|Awesome series! Romance a little mystery and an interesting story line. After you finish the last book you want to read more about the characters and their lives. Highly recommend
B00F91H15W|1.0|What boring movie! I couldn't get through 30 minutes of it. The characters were annoying and it was slow paced. Nothing like the exciting trailer.
B000E0W24S|5.0|I am not sure whether there is really much to say about these recordings that hasn't already been said. Mravinsky's take on the last three Tchaikovsky symphonies makes for one of the greatest recordings ever made, and the Leningrad Philharmonic plays their hearts out - the 1960 sound is also surprisingly good, and any music lover who missed these recordings would definitely have a serious hole in their collection. Though I don't claim to know all the supposedly great performances of these works out there, Mravinsky wins hands down in comparison with any other performance I have heard in all three. These performances may not have the last words in terms of refinement - this is raw, gory, fervent interpretations, but to my ears Mravinsky and his Leningrad players just about proves that this is precisely what this music needs.<br /><br />Who, I wonder, can challenge the blazing power and fervent energy of this performance of the fourth? As for the fifth, I used to like the Jansons performance quite a bit (still do, I suppose), but although Jansons generates tremendous momentum, his account sounds monochromatic and detached compared to Mravinsky - Bernstein's unfocused ruminations, to take another example, does not even begin to compare (the comparison with Mravinsky just goes to show how Bernstein failed to grasp the overall structure of this work). In the sixth the competition is, I suppose, pretty fierce, but I, at least, have never heard a performance that comes even close in terms of emotional intensity. If you fail to be profoundly moved by the last movement in this performance I ... don't really know what to tell you. In short, this is an absolutely mandatory acquisition.

So much more than &#34;the edge of reason.&#34; In fact, even more than the original!!<br /><br />BUT - SPOILER ALERT!! -<br /><br />...<br /><br />you have to accept that for our favorite heroine to have further romantic adventures...someone else must no longer be around. I didn't really get this before reading and then spent much of the book being very very sad about this essential fact.<br /><br />Ok, now that you know this - go my child and enjoy!!
0394818237|3.0|My 3 year old and I read this book together.  The jobs are pretty dated, but it is a fun book with lots to see and talk about.  My son still loves to read it on a regular basis.  He loves reading about the travel by train & boat.

B00271DNP4|3.0|There's no doubt this is probably the slowest, film with the least action. Don't get me wrong it is very fun just like all the rest but im sure  a lot of us expected more. We never find out why it is Remus is a werewolf even if it does say in other films there could have been much more to go on if we had all this information, also why is it that Black and Lupin never told Harry they were the creators of the Maurders map? We didnt get a lot of information of this important bit either. The last is there is only a few references towards \\"He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named\\" and it didn't show anything about him whatsoever and that was really disappointing im sure for everyone also. I really didn't expect it to end so abruptly also with the cheesy potter smile and then credits! What a disappointment. We did get a lot of new info and that will go a good way in the other films.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It was unique and gave an interesting world building. Mandane: meaning humans, reminds me of harry potter:muggles haha. I thought the ending was something unexpected and wish it wasn't the case, but I'm sure the other has something up her sleeve for the next book.

The game always runs smoothly on my Kindle HD FIRE and  any  balls bounced off of walls go right where you'd expect them to. Now if only more of my friends played so I could get more lives, 5 just isn't enough for something so addicting lol.
B00ENBS4GO|4.0|This was a great final season for the series.  The story line was excellent, the acting was terrific....each episode drew you in.  This is one of those rare series where the blood and guts seems to paint the whole series as a backdrop to the desperate unhuman lives that slaves would have lived in this time period.  The difficulty for me is the gore and blood (yes and guts), I found myself having mixed emotions about the series because of its extreme violence...this is not a family time show.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|Oh Snap!  One of the best movies I have ever seen and looks awesome in Blu-Ray!  The &#34;unrated&#34; cut includes some additional gore which is always a good thing in Zombie movies!
B00APUQRPC|4.0|This was a good basic story...no sex, no violence to speak of....I enjoyed it....this would be  a good family night movie to watch.
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. The billing put Jaden before Will reflecting the focus in the movie.<br /><br />The Jaden-Will relationship in the movie reflected their relationship in real life. Famous father with proven accomplishment, and untested son struggling to match his father and form a loving bond of mutual respect.<br /><br />Well Done. I highly recommend this movie
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|What can I say?  Excellent series!  Can't wait for the third installment which seems to be taking forever!  COME ON AMAZON!  WHATS THE HOLDUP!

0744014956|5.0|Great strategy guide. Has plenty of information on how to get gold medals on all the missions.  Plenty of information on the vehicles in the game. Has information all past times and activities available in the game. Worth the price. Glad I got it for $22.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Chromecast is a neat idea but at this time that is all it is.  Without support for more apps it has extremely limited use.  You might as well pay the extra money and buy a Roku or Apple TV which have a full feature set.  The only reason i'm giving two stars is that the device itself is neat and works decently from a technical perspective.
B005HED11Y|4.0|star trek, you either are or you aren't a fan... season one starts off without Chekov, but then you have something to look forward to in the cold war exchange of ideas in later episodes..... still silly looking after viewing the blockbuster movies, season 1 still exemplifies the movement from idealism to realism.... it is especially fun to view some products we take for granted in the 21st century.... watch communicators, folding communicators, needle-less inoculators and the famous i-pads that Captain Kirk signs inner-ship memos on.  Watch it again, or for the first time if you're a newbie Trekkie....

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so happy when I found the right CANDY CRASH SAGA!I got tired of people tried to make other lines.I'm so happy!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|The only thing missing in the movie is Me otherwise it's not too bad. Joking. But for real it is a good movie
B0079TQHDO|5.0|I consider Jeffery Archer a great story teller and cannot wait until he publishes a new book.  This book is great. A real page turner
B0094LU2TU|5.0|If you've never watched it, you should, as long as you can handle the &#34;handy cam&#34; experience. It doesn't shake quite as much as others of a similar shooting style, and gets steadier once the film reaches a certain point, but I know that my parents and girlfriend could not watch it because of the early-movie shaking the camera was doing.<br /><br />As for the actual content of the movie, I would say that it delivers the storyline very well. The metaphors and comparisons made are amazing and truly cut to the bone unless you purposely attempt to put everything else out of your mind and take it at face-value as an alien movie. Would seem a difficult thing to do, in my opinion, but I guess it's possible.<br /><br />Anyway, I loved it, and the director definitely knows how to create tension and suspense for the viewer. Great movie, great story.
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|Jeffery Archer has been entertaining us for years and is still the best.  Really look forward to each and every one of his books.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love Downton Abbey! Great writing and acting! I highly recommend this series to anyone who appreciates quality TV. You'll be hooked.
098478280X|5.0|Other classmate recommend this book to me. I had read it for two weeks, and then went to an interview. They just asked the questions on this book!
B00D0Z2JT2|4.0|It was exactly as advertised. The only thing that could have made it better would have been for it to have english subtitles, however, it did state that it did not have them, so thats not an advertisement issue, rather a production issue that i feel could have been implemented. Good sale
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|What i might of liked or what i definitely would not have like about the game buttons and scissors. That is something i do not know. Nor why I'm having to do this review.,seeing that i didnt get the game nor have i ever played it. . I gave it a 4 ,cause i thought thats about how much fun i would have playing it ..  Looked like a fun game. Thats all !
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I use this game as a vibrant reminder of my childhood. I raised horses, and now live in the city. It is very simple and easy to navigate.
B005SMGRH0|5.0|one and only hip-hop cd, I like getting cd and dvd all in one. I'm 65 and play gorillaz daily, !main genre is blues, Gorllaz blues for new millenium !
B00B7FW6U4|3.0|You seen one you seen them all it's just ok.Its a ok movie to watch if they are nothing else on.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This is one of those electronic gizmos that you get and you hook it up exactly like the directions say and it doesn't work. So you think, \\"Hmmmm I must not have been paying attention.\\" So you try it again and it doesn't work. After 30 minutes trying to hook it up using my laptop, I gave up.<br />Then I got my iPhone out and it hooked up fine the 1st time. After it was hooked up there were only 2 apps I could run. Netflix and YouTube.  I already have those on my TV anyway and they run better from the TV. Netflix was a compressed picture and I couldn't get the sound to work and the same with YouTube.<br />Summary, I will never use this. I will however plug it in from time to time to see if there are updates. Save your money.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|A lovely easy to read book - so much so that I will purchase more of Jill Sanders books to read.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is just the right size for my fat fingers. Also I never go anywhere without my kindle. I'm serious! Even in my house I carry it everywhere making it easy to use the calculator plus anytime. Thanks for this easy and perfect size app!!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great read Stephen king as done it again. He bring you back to the shinning but it a way it is so far from it. It great to see a character grow up from one of his great books.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I came to Feedly via the Google Reader shutdown. I have been quite pleased with the result. I think I spend less time keeping up with my RSS reading than I used to, without missing anything. Feedly 's interface is easy to navigate on all platforms I use. The swipe motions on the Kindle Fire seem particularly simple and intuitive. I'm satisfied with this software and suggest it to anyone looking for a straightforward cross platform feed reader.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|A delightful adaption of the Chris Van Allsburg book of the same name.  Will melt even the most devout Scrooge.
B00FEN000S|4.0|What's not to like?  Giant fighting robots... fighting epic battles ...against a plague of giant, extra-dimensional, monsters!<br /><br />The story is set on cruise control but like-able all the same because of the excellent actors and direction.  Every detail you ever dreamed of when you were watching ...(name your favorite anime here) ...is brought to glorious life by del Toro and crew.<br /><br />Get the popcorn.  Turn down the lights.  Turn up the sound.  And enjoy the ride.<br /><br />Awesomely, awesome!
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|What's not to like?  In addition to the films themselves really liked the fact that the boxed set has each film in a small slip case rather than a bulky jewel box.  The bonus features on each film are a real plus and the dvd of Whoopi Goldberg interviewing William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Patrick Stewart, and Jonathan Frakes is not to be missed.
B000088E6D|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised how enjoyable this CD was for my family to listen to. We enjoy the variety, too.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Good action film. Surprisingly smart, all the more so considering how stupid the Stallone *Judge Dredd* was. No surprises, but the script was solid, the cast was great, & the Megacity dystopia was believably worn out and used up.
B00AIGQTEC|2.0|I first heard the song \\"Rock and Roll Love Affair\\" when Prince performed it on Jimmy Kimmel Live. I hated it. How could THIS be the new Prince single? That's what I remembered thinking. Then again, I wasn't terribly surprised given the wildly uneven quality of Prince's release over the last decade or so.<br /><br />Hearing the original single mix (or the original extended mix, whatever - it's track one here), the tune grew on me a bit. It's just a harmless little pop rocker. It has an oddly \\"clean\\" sound - reminds me a lot of \\"The One U Wanna C\\" from Planet Earth (though not as fun).<br /><br />The remixes though are kind of a waste of time. For the price of the maxi-single download, I say might as well. You're not saving much money by just getting the Original Extended Mix. The Original Radio Edit is okay too, but I stick with the longer version if I'm going to listen to it. The Jamie Lewis mixes try to turn this into some kind of a club banger, but the mild pop production of the original song doesn't lend itself well to this approach.
0151003084|5.0|Like the other books by this author, this is a wonderful story. Great story you can go back to and not get tired of it.
B00EUS9JF0|4.0|I hate having to give a star rating to an album (especially without half-star options). Right now I'm excited about the first new collection of original material McCartney's released since 2007 (although I think of Electric Arguments as a McCartney album - and one of his most interesting, too). So that excitement clouds my objectivity. I've been listening to New exclusively for the last couple days and still don't have any idea where I think it falls in his long line of vastly different albums. But I'm pretty sure it will land somewhere in the top half rather than the bottom. I personally think it's unfair to compare every new McCartney album to Revolver, Sgt Pepper, Abbey Road, etc.<br /><br />I think it's also unfair to go into a 2013 McCartney album expecting his voice to magically sound like it's 1973. Or even 1993. He's been belting out rock and roll songs for over 50 years. It has taken a toll that singers like Tony Bennett (or Ringo for that matter) have an easier time of avoiding. I love the weathered sound of his voice on songs like \\"Early Days.\\" That's how he sounds now. But I also greatly admire the energy he can still muster for songs like \\"Save Us\\" and \\"Queenie Eye.\\"<br /><br />I think it was a silly decision to take two good tracks and designate them as bonus cuts for this \\"deluxe\\" edition. \\"Turned Out\\" is a punchy little track with a riff that reminds me a little of something The Who might've done in the early years. \\"Get Me Out of Here\\" is a fun little bluesy cut (I like the jokey reference to that reality show - which has lasted far longer in the UK than it did in the US). I also think \\"Scared\\" - a fragile, emotionally raw piano/voice duet - should've had it's own dedicated track rather than being \\"hidden\\" at the end of whichever of three versions the consumer chose.<br /><br />Which brings me to... the Japanese-only \\"Struggle.\\" This just might be my favorite cut and it's the hardest one to get! By no means a throwaway, I have a feeling \\"Struggle\\" would be a lot of people's favorite - a slow-building, hypnotic mood piece that has a \\"big\\" production feel without feeling overproduced.<br /><br />But back to the standard track list. Initial favorites at this point: can't seem to get \\"On My Way to Work\\" out of my mind. \\"Early Days\\" has received a lot of attention and I think it's justified. \\"Save Us\\" is a great, rocking opener. \\"Hosanna\\" is a beautiful, meditative song. And the title track is irresistibly tuneful.<br /><br />In my mind, the only one I would consider kind of a throwaway is \\"I Can Bet.\\" Reminds me of \\"I You Wanna\\" on Flaming Pie. I'm kind of ambivalent at this point about \\"Alligator\\" (sounds like something leftover from Driving Rain, not a fave album of mine) and \\"Road\\" which just doesn't really go anywhere. In fact, instead of closing the standard version of New with \\"Road,\\" I would've put \\"Struggle\\" as the closer.
B002CMXAYW|5.0|An aquired taste perhaps, but for some like me - a perennial favorite. Spinal Tap rocks. Tap into the movie.
B006PZBRCY|3.0|Another story about a kid that is smarter and more responsible than his parent. Over placement of HP advertisements throughout the movie. Halfway decent CG.
B00FWLSOOG|4.0|Really liked it, although I was skeptical at first. Worth a purchase as it's fun to watch multiple times. My only regret was that the monster fights are always in the dark , and in the water,and you really don't get a real good view of the beasties or the Jaegers. Still think it is the best &#34;giant monster&#34; movie yet made.
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|This was one of the best movies I have seen in years. Most movies are pretty predictable but this one was a surprise beginning to end. And what a great cast. I don't want to say to much for fear of spoiling it for others. I think it is a very good movie one that can be watched by the whole family. Thought provoking without the violence, nudity and sophomoric fart jokes that many movies seem to need in order to keep the watcher intertained. I hope they can find a way to come up with a sequel.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Very scary and realistic, new elements of surprise, the zombies are more severely rotted, this would make sense because years have passed since the outbreak.  The characters have developed nicely and have purpose.  Well done, can't wait for more.
B005LAIIN0|4.0|Did not see the movie in the movies. I did read the book which the movie is based on.  It was somewhat close to the book.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is well worth playing! I really love the challenges and the creativity it takes to solve each room. I can hardly wait for the next set of rooms to come!
B00BGI08GG|5.0|The story is very exciting and interesting, and the starring actor is so cool and beautiful. He is so irresistible.  The other casts are also wonderful.
0440237688|5.0|Really enjoyed reading this book.  Very simple, easy read that will keep you interested...what a concept thought of &#34;sameness&#34;. Very thought provoking book!
B0094LYM14|5.0|Moon is a wonderful film. At some times slow moving but always engaging, Moon asks you to think about your own moral compass. Well written, well acted, well shot, Moon is a must see.<br /><br />This is the first part of a trilogy. The next will be called Mute and is currently being written by Duncan Jones (David Bowie's son) as a graphic novel, which will then be adopted for film.
B009RX7WTI|4.0|I love Greys so I will pretty much love anything they come out with but this is one of my least favorite seasons.
B001LM1456|5.0|I loved this movie because it was not an origin story. As a comic lover, I get tired of all the reprisals of origin stories with different directors, actors, and visions, and I found this a refreshingly true-to-the-comic story that ran on the assumption the viewer knows who the Hulk is. The celebrity cameos are some of the best in the Marvel films, and the Abomination lived up to his name. What's not to love?
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|I've been waiting for this book for years and yes I miss Mark and yes there are an abundance of fart jokes but you know what..it's Bridget Jones! I laughed out loud- a lot and I cried and I loved it
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|Scarey premise. Reminds one of the movie, &#34;Enemy of the State.&#34; I cancelled my Facebook account while still reading this.
1450419895|3.0|if you have never read anything on weight lifting then this would be good beginner stuff. Not enough exercises for muscles in book, should be more exhaustive in that area, more useful info online. I returned the book.
B00D8RYV52|5.0|We love the Dr. Panda games/ learning tools for our grandson!  He gets totally engrossed in<br />them .  Garage is one of his favorites!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I love the walking dead! Season 4 is going to be as intriguing and the other three seasons and that is why the show is so successful.
B00EDF43MY|5.0|Our grandson is enjoying and learning so much from the Dr. Panda games! I try to download all of<br />  Of them
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I really liked this app and it was easy to navigate if you actually took time to look around. You don't need an instruction manual for everything, it's called common sense.<br /><br />If was more than I was expecting. I just wanted something with a decent rating to put my story blarbs into my kindle. I wasn't expecting the 'read it back' feature, which is awesome, by the way. However, that's where my only part of confusion comes in. On some stories, the audio works great, but on others, it won't work. Is it something I'm doing wrong?<br /><br />Yes, the audio could be a little more consistent (it has a slow, funny way of saying 'closet'), but overall, I'm happy with it. Not planning on buying the Pro version though. 4 stars.
B008DVJOG4|5.0|I already had this cd, however, it got stuck in my cd player and I was unable to retrieve it. I laved it so much, I had to order another.
B007C3TVEY|5.0|Tilda Swinton could have had a V8. But, she had a baby and named him Kevin instead. Tilda Swinton is very good in this. But, she has bad feet and bone spurs. They are far more terrifying than Uma Thurman's feet. Thank God Quentin Tarantino didn't direct this, because there would have been way too many close-ups of Tilda's feet for me to handle. I'm sensing a tomato theme here with lots of tomato symbolism dipped in tomato juice. If I had produced this movie, I would have called it \\"We Need to Talk About Tomatoes.\\" Now let's get serious: this movie is hilarious. But, it may be too intense for younger tomatoes. BE FOREWARNED: many tomatoes died in the making of this film. ﻿
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is a great little game to keep your mind focused. I really like the still screen mode better than the 3D mode though...I would reccommend this game to others.
B004P7CNE0|3.0|I purchased this as a gift for my daughter. From what I heard it was a good movie. I can't really reccomended myself because I have not seen it.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|American Horror Story: Asylum was excellent.  I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I liked the first season a little better. But overall it was awesome...I love that the actors come back as different characters. Two thumbs up.
B0000549B0|5.0|This is an all time classic. The cast was the original Broadway cast. The fear when it was first produced was it might not translate to film well. On the contrary it translated beautifully. Not only did I enjoy it , but so did the grandchildren. Truly a movie for the whole family.
1439152810|5.0|Kate Morton hit a home run here. Kept my interest right up to the end. I must find more Kate Morton books.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|I was a little skeptical about how this story would play out. I purchased it because of the trailers I had seen. I will have to say that it was an intriguing web of horror and pyschomania.
B00FHG19T8|3.0|Amos Lee is great and there are are few excellent songs.  However,  I do not think the entire album measures up to his usual stellar efforts.
B004GJYROG|5.0|Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes gang bring fun and frolic to the screen. it doesn't matter if you are young or old everyone is welcomed to the Space Jam.
B0094K20FK|5.0|Although I have watched this many times, I still enjoy this movie.  I'm sure that I will watch it many more times, that's how much I like it!  Perhaps my views are skewed, as I have been a fan of Star Trek since the original series over 40 years ago.  I still go back and watch the original episodes from time to time.  It has been said, many times, that I need to get a real hobby.
0525953728|5.0|Super Awesome!! A quick and easy-to-understand read about the Navy Seals and life in it, particularly Seal Team 6!! Yes, I would recommend this read to anyone!!
B000B5Y00U|5.0|This recording is an example of operatic singing that is not available now.  The three principals offer singing and emotional involvement of the highest order.  The conducting is prolematic but don't allow this to keep your from owning this very special performance. Highly recommended
B0026SFEW8|5.0|Watched with kids.  They loved it!  A little racy, but it mostly went over there heads.  Recommend for the whole family.
B00E9P959O|5.0|With Vapor Trails now being over 10 years old, it has had enough time to blend into the context of the entire Rush catalog.  I feel the same about the album today as I did back in 2002.  It ranks among my favorites.  At that time, I applauded Rush for creating a hard rock album relevant to the times.  It was rock with modern sound and mix approach.  It had edge and emotion.  The lyrics were less pointed and more open to interpretation.  I never minded that the individual instrument and vocal tracks were in my face, because I believed that the band wanted it this way.  It was their comeback album.  Neil had been through rough times, but the guys finally committed to a project.  The intent of the whole package shouted that Rush was back, and I loved it that way.<br /><br />To further my point on the intentionality of the original mix, check-out their live album \\"Rush in Rio\\" which was recorded on their tour supporting VT.  The sound on that CD comes at you with a heavy punch--even the crowd noise is turned-up in the mix.  I love the way they recorded this concert.  Next to All the World's a Stage, RIR is my favorite live Rush album.<br /><br />One Little Victory brings more inspiration to me than probably any other Rush song.  Ghost Rider has a similar emotional vibe.  Rush is a thinking man's band, but this album is wrought with emotion like no other Rush.<br /><br />I'm a bit of an audiophile, so I have good equipment.  I appreciate sound quality and all kinds of music.  I decided that Rush was mixing Vapor Trails the way a lot of new rock engineers do, with all the tracks pushed up front.<br /><br />All that said, the new remixes are outstanding.  The wider dynamic range enables the listener to pick-out all the instruments better and hear detail never heard before (for example, listen for the subtle backdrop of static now in Secret Touch).  New pieces and parts have been added and some parts have been replaced.  If you turn it up a little, it'll still hit you likea ton of bricks.<br /><br />I'm sure I'll listen to the new mix exclusively now but treasure the memory of first appreciating the Vapor Trails jam session back in 2002.  No doubt my favorite Rush album since Moving Pictures.
B0049J3QAY|5.0|I'm sure everything that can be said about this movie has been said, it's another pixar classic.<br /><br />Our two year old seemed to think it was funny, but I'm not sure she understood what was going on.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Couldn't put this one down, takes you to a world you can't imagine.  You get involved with the characters and want to advise them....haha.
B00BZ55BBC|5.0|The book is a great explanation of evolution the pictures helped me understand the complex ideas I would definitely recommend this book to others.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow! This book keeps you wanting more and more. Fast reading has love and romance what more do you want or is it?
B00F880BWG|5.0|Best. Show. Ever. Keeps us on the edge of our seats which not many shows or movies can do .
B00A285OOW|5.0|Very good book to fallow up the White Queen, Red Queen and King Makers Daughter. I was kind of bummed with the ending, but made me want to read more.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game! You definitely have to do some thinking on the different levels.It can easily become a very addicting game
B00457WZEI|4.0|I think I cried more reading this bood than watching the movie. Wonderfully book and was very pleased with it.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Great game.  Our whole family is addicted.  The boys love receiving a giving gifts.  They also get so excited to buy a new dinosaur, especially our little paleontologist!
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Wow, very cool to read this book after reading The White Queen and The Red Queen. This author has managed to capture a 3rd point of veiw to the story and lives of these women!
B002LL13BQ|4.0|Beautiful...every child should see this and learn from it..the switch to color is spectacular as are the performances of the children
B000FC146C|5.0|Wonderful story.  Great character development.  Learned  a great deal about Australia. I highly recommend it. Might even read it again.
B000T0XEGS|5.0|The best Traviata ever.  All who say they hate opera will be enthralled by this production..musically it does not get better
B000001FK3|5.0|This has always been one of the&#34; have to own&#34; for anybody's music collection.Anyone that can write songs good enough for Slowhand and Skynard probably should be good enough for us to J.J. R.I.P.
B00FHNBDC4|4.0|Chill in the Air and Dresser Drawer are two of my favorites.  I really like the way the lyrics of his songs capture your attention, pulling you into the story, resulting in personal reflection.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Not much of a story line, just sex. So I guess if that is what you are looking for it is great
B0036S4B6M|5.0|This book was interesting, well-written, and informative.  Her own story was fascinating as well as the commentary on the prison system as a whole.
B00004TDRD|5.0|Movie was brand new and in perfect shape.  it was a most enjoyable transaction from beginning to end.  I loved it!

B000E5N6LG|5.0|I love this movie!  It is only rated 2 stars, I cannot imagine why.  I  have watched this a number of times and like it better evry time!  Kevin Costner is a perfect Earp, and Dennis Quaid is the best, most accurate Doc Holiday.  If you haven't seen this yet...treat yourself.  You'll be glad you did!
B00ARN0ZF0|5.0|Found it to be like the rest of the series, exciting, unexpecting, thrilling, s*** in your pants scary. Way cool.
B00BJ9VBLI|3.0|I agree it is a fun game, however shortly into free play one must purchase the game. Other than that it is a fun game.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|The only dislike was that the streaming was not in full high definition with noticeable pixelation especially during the darker scenes.
B008YJFDQK|4.0|I discovered Ben Harper sort of by accident. His voice is so soothing. I like to watch his performance videos. His music is very soothing and thouthful.

B00DHHWYAW|3.0|Ok movie the 3D is a nice novelty. If you listened to all the hype about this movie it doesn't really live up to it.
B001MEJY8W|1.0|I am so ashamed of myself. I have a 3 digit IQ but still fell for the old film company writing there own propaganda as the first reviews and then publishing them as if they were the public who had watched the movie. This movie didn't cause even the slightest ripple in my nerves or mind. It didn't bother me, upset me or disturb me for months as they claimed. They actually wrote over and over in at least a dozen company reviews that I read that it is the most disturbing movie ever made. I went over all the reviews again and realized that they all sound the same, what a dummy I am. They all start out with, \\"well I'm not going to give away the plot or spoilers but this is seriously the most disturbing movie ever, still bothers me six months later. WHAT!!!! PLEASE!!!! They even made references to the movie,\\" hostel \\"while trying to make one believe the torture scenes are bearable if you can handle the torture scenes in, ' Hostel ', which are very graphic. Well guess what THERE ARE NO ACTUAL TORTURE SCENES, JUST IMPLIED unless you consider being chained up and punched in the stomach 7 or 8 times torture. Unlike all the studio execs who wrote the propaganda,  I am going to tell you the plot . It's about a bunch of old geezers who have decided that they can't die unless they have proof of life after death so one old nut decides that  the best way to accomplish this is by kidnapping little children and torturing them until they see God and then the little tykes can tell the old geezers what heavens all about. Living Martyrs so to speak. It's nuts to know that to be martyred one has to be dead in the first place. The movie actually plays out like 2 ⚁ separate short screenplays shoved together with some of the dumbest filler I have ever seen in a very transparent attempt to link what I consider 2 separate short stories into a complete movie 🎥 I have to admit that the first short,  that I could call, ' Lucia's revenge ', was very well done and very exciting to watch,  thisis the only good part of the movie where one watching feels justified, it takes place 15 years after Lucia escaped from the clutches of her kidnappers. She tracks them down 👇 and goes to their house with a shotgun, rings the doorbell and without hesitation blows away one by one every one in the house including blowing the heads off the children as they ate cereal mixed with a little bit of brain matter and she does it with the same sense of mercy that they showed her when she was 8 years old. The filler is absolutely unrealistic and just plain too stupid to believe. After Lucia blows the entire family 👪 away and then takes her own life. Her friend instead of leaving right 👉 away, she decided it's better to stay at some strangers house 🏡 with all the dead bodies for three or four days, just long enough for the old geezers to show up and capture her. This was so corny to me that it reminded me of the coed, ax murderer movies like one I just had the displeasure of watching were in one scene a coed is screaming running around the house with the axe murderer hot 🔥 on her trail, the coed turns a corner and starts screaming 😱 louder because on the floor in front of her is the dead body of her friend, a dead friend who just happened to have a loaded 38 revolver in her cold dead hand ✋. Now this is the part that reminds me of the filler used in, ' Martyr's' . The coed instead of picking up the loaded pistol and blowing away the axe murderer decides it's safer to start screaming even louder and takes off running around the house again. Come on guys you can do better than this. This is the kind of filler that the, Martyr's screenwriter thought was sufficient to tie one great short story with a lesser second short. Dumb, just dumb. But my guess is that all the 14 to 17 year olds are going to love this movie.Their is no deep or subtle spiritual meaning here as their reviews like you to believe, just a guy short on words and ideas when he wrote this screenplay.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Loved this movie, even cooler in 3D! This movie was non stop action and is could barely breathe! A great sequel in the series.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Absolutely loved it- great drama and the dialogue is brilliant, the tug between the classes is especially apparent in this season.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I loved this book.  The characters were real, the humor surprising but so right,  and while I was at it I fell in love  with Walt.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|This review is coming from a casual sci-fi fan who is trying to add to his Blu-ray collection. The ONLY thing I could get on this collections case negatively was the material used for the box. It's very very pretty. And in being very very pretty, it is susceptible to fingerprints no matter how much one washes ones hands.<br /><br />Just saying..those fingerprint marks are killer for aesthetics.<br /><br />Oh and there's movies inside that pretty case I think. I suppose they're ok :)
B00499NHLC|5.0|I'm a big fan of everything Sherlock Holmes.  This is a refreshing take on the great detective set in the present rather than Victorian England. Anxiously awaiting the new episodes.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It has a great story, I loved it!!!  All three books flows together nicely, you  start the 1st one you better have book 2 ready to start:)

B00475AYJQ|5.0|It's not the best book I've ever read, but it's very good. I definitely think it's better than the first, so if you looked that one, you'll love this one.<br /><br />I changed my mind, I love this book.  I think the writing style itself wasn't the best, (not bad, mind you), but the books have stuck with me.
B0018OFN4U|5.0|Love this movie and if you like a good funny zombie movie .please buy this .simon pegg is great  and so is  the rest of the cast
0486282112|4.0|Written nearly 2 centuries ago, Frankenstein continues to thrive, as though it has a life of its own. The trope of the mad scientist bringing an abomination to life came from the pages of Mary Shelley's imagination. She expertly crafts the tragic story of Victor Frankenstein, a young, ambitious scientist that becomes obsessed with unlocking the secret to natural life.  He succeeds in his goal by combining various body parts, mysterious chemicals, unknown technology and a strange final spark. The Monster arises and wreaks havoc on the Victor's life, though not without its own reasons.<br /><br />Frankenstein, is a story that not only gives you shivers of revulsion, it also leaves the reader wondering if science ever should unlock nature's secrets, as well as questioning the line between good and evil.  Its prose unravels, to reveal the tragic life of Victor (and how his mad search for revenge consumed him), as well as mirroring the tragedy of Mary Shelley herself. Rife with romantic and Gothic undertones, Frankenstein is possibly one of the first examples of Science Fiction.<br /><br />I felt that the novel was a great story, even though sometimes I needed a break to digest and search Spark Notes for exact meaning behind certain chapters, overall it was intensely interesting to read and to connect the story to the author's life, as well as see how today's pop culture has twisted and morphed the original story.<br /><br />Overall a 9/10, would recommend for anyone who loves sci-fi, horror, and anyone who is interested in women authors.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I took way too long in reading yet another Clancy thriller.<br />His books will always impress me.  I have many more to read.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Smartly revealed storyline with no pulled punches.  Author doesn't care is you like the main character or not. Wanted to figure it out before nick did
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved this book.  I Got really attached to each character. It shows how life is a funny thing and you really never know how different tomorrow will be  from today.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|My title says it all.  It has potential but right now it does was my roku xbox 360 And DVD player does but less. I can only play netflix and YouTube. In fact the company I purchased this from(amazon) will not let me stream videos from their site
B006IGZWB2|5.0|This is a movie I can watch over and over. The actors are all magnificent and portray their characters so accurately. Have the tissues ready - it moved me to tears many times.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I bought this expecting to be able to stream video from my internet devices to my flat-screen TV. Setup was easy and painless as my old Sony Bravia worked flawlessly with the new Chromecast. I was able to see my Chrome browser from my laptop on my big screen TV. But it wouldn't show videos pasted into the browser. I tried a few other things but it was close to bedtime and I figured I could try again tomorrow.<br /><br />The next day nothing would work on Chromecast. Also, the light on the device was red instead of white. I removed the device rebooted my TV and laptop and hit the reset button on the chromecast device. Still nothing. I called Google and the tech had me reboot everything but it still wouldn't work.<br /><br />I returned the device for instant credit from Amazon and now I'll wait for the &#34;next big thing&#34;.
B000J1AGQI|4.0|We Were Soldiers is an enjoyable Mel Gibson movie which is based on the book We Were Soldiers Once...And Young.  It could be beyond enjoyable-a transcendent study of war-but the movie deviates from the book in several significant ways.  As a result it is more of a pre-Iraq Attack propaganda flick.<br /><br />Mel Gibson stars as LTC Hal Moore the commander of a squadron of the 7th Cavalry who first battles the North Vietnamese Army using the US Army's Airmobile Tactics as well as heavy fire support in the Battle of the Ia Drang Valley.<br /><br />The film is a bowdlerized version of The Nam, ignoring the important realities of the war as well as the critical study of the political limitations at the start of escalation that so warped the American effort.  The book is far more frank of this reality.<br /><br />The film also pays surprising homage to contemporary America's civil religion of &#34;diversity.&#34;  Of course, racial tension nearly crippled the US Army in Vietnam and may have contributed to the ultimate defeat of American objectives therein.  This un-necessary but included inversion of reality seems to stem from the current of deliberate denial of diversity's problems that was a major part of the Bush Administration's actions following 9-11.<br /><br />The film also ignores the remainder of the Battle at Ia Drang-in particular the devastating ambush at LZ Albany.<br /><br />Of course, it is only a movie and there are great parts to it.  It does highlight the valor of the Americans in Vietnam, it shows the home front, and the necessary building of trust necessary for successful operations.  Superb acting, casting, wardrobe and set.
B001NLL93W|3.0|This book ended with a lot of unanswered questions. Let's hope the next one fills in the blanks. I like that Simon was more of a leading character in this book. I hate that Clary & Jace are still trying to pull it together. Its just too much after all they have been through that they still find it hard to be together. That's just the shit that needs to be fixed.
B00DGO8CL6|5.0|It's been a while in the making, but, for all those die hard Elton fans, this release will be a real gem. The production by T-Bone is very evident and some of the tracks have a real blues feel to them, with Elton going back to basics of piano bass and drums and not his regular band. Great
1476727651|5.0|Excellent book. I couldn't put it down. A section shocked me but I won't tell what it was. Not particularly scary but well written.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|it'd really fun. it used to be five stars. over time it starts to really reallybsuck.bi don't play it anymore
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Good book, slow at times. I would recommend it. Feel good read with inspiring words. Not a page turner but you will still come back.

B0032UYFA6|5.0|We REALLY love the show!! We didn't watch any of it 'live', but waited until we had a couple of seasons on DVD and binge watched every weekend.<br />The writing is terrific and the acting is even better. We have S5 V2 left to watch and we are going through withdrawals!
B003EY7JH6|5.0|GENIUS!<br /><br />On another note, if you like Douglas Adam's books, I'm sure Amazon has beaten me too it and has recommended this book.
B009GED3HS|5.0|this show is awesome i would recommend it to anyone who loves to laugh i will be really sad when its done but atleast i have to forever now
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|This tale has been exiting, mind boggling and an excellent read. You never knew \\" who did it\\"until the end and still had excitement in the final chapter.  This authors address Ponte Verdra FL surprised me. I am an avid reader and live in St Augustine,Florida. I am happy to be in close proximity too such a great writer.  Thank you . Joyce Messecar
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Outstanding novel.  Realistic.  Gritty.  Complex.  World building on an epic scale.  Excellent revelation of plot details as the story unfolds.  A+++  Can hardly wait to read the next one.
B008B3MZNI|4.0|Great concert. It's really nice to watch the group in their best moment. Great performances and very good sound. Fully recommended.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I don't watch American Idol so I had no idea who Phillip Phillips was when I first heard his song &#34;Home&#34; on the radio, but I have quickly become a huge fan of his.  I have an eclectic taste in music and don't care for bubble gum, mass produced garbage.  There is nothing bubble gum or mass produced (sounding) to Phillip Phillips.  His music is pure, simple, sincere and engaging.  I love it!
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|I knew going in that I would not agree with the conclusions, but I expected better than this.  Aslan said that he included all the scholars that agreed with him and those that didn't agree.  While he included some references that did not agree with him on the minutiae, virtually every Christian scholar was left out.  I expected that Aslan would make his case by interacting with authors like Josh McDowell, William Lane Craig, Gary Habermas, John MacArthur, etc.  However, in the introduction he manner-of-factly stated that Christianity was not factual and then went on.  This allowed him to share his beliefs without opposition, leaving only serious Bible scholars to know if he knows what he is talking about.<br /><br />When he does go against a conservative Christian viewpoint, he does it without any explanation.  He gave dates for the writing of the New Testament books that are much later than many scholars believe, but gave no reasoning or documentation for these dates.  He claims that Paul wrote some of the New Testament books attributed to him and did not write others, but gives no explanation for how he knows this or what the difference is between what Paul wrote and what he didn't.  He says that James was always the leader of the church and that certain passages in the New Testament were later changed from \\"James, Peter, and John\\" to \\"Peter, James, and John\\" to downplay James' role in the church later on, but again he does not give any source or explanation.<br /><br />The book is not footnoted numerically, so it is very hard to determine the source of a specific claim (when sources are given).  The notes at the end serve more as a \\"For further reading\\" section than actual endnotes.<br /><br />He believes that much of what is in the gospels was made up much later to promote a Christianity that had no basis in fact.  He believes that many passages of Scripture are definitely true, but others are fiction.  It comes across as one who starts with a viewpoint and picks the evidence to fit.  He believes that Jews did not take their prophecies literally (which is wrong).  He believes that Peter and James knew that Jesus did not rise from the dead and failed as a messiah, and yet they committed their lives, all the way to martyrdom, to establishing a religion built around his teachings.  He believes that Jesus was a miracle worker, but does not tell how Jesus was able to do these miracles or why he doesn't believe in most of the miracles recorded in the New Testament.<br /><br />He uses ancient sources such as Josephus, who was known to embellish his history, and Hegesippus, whom we only have in quotes from other authors, and whom he admits has disputed reliability, as if they are fact, but he doubts most of what is said in the gospels even though they are by far the most abundantly and reliably copied manuscripts of all ancient writing.<br /><br />For a person who does not believe in Christianity to write a book stating why he doesn't believe it is one thing, but this book assumes its conclusion before it starts.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Loved it just wish the hulk was a little more involved in the story line and how come he's never the same character in each hulk movie
B001FB4VY4|5.0|This second season just improves on everything that made the first season so enjoyable. A genius idea in making geek culture part of sitcom, simultaneously celebrating it while subtly mocking it while making everybody happy is not a small feat. There are some very memorable episodes this season, particularly the one where Penny's competition moves in in the form of a new blonde neighbor, it was the first episode I felt they gave Penny the absolute best lines in. Hands down a must watch television show, even for those like myself, may not prefer the sitcom as a television genre.
030726999X|5.0|This is an excellent book that was actually turned into an excellent movie!  Actually the only book trilogy that I was unable to put down, but had to read from cover to cover while I was cooking, while I was washing laundry, while I was making the bed!!!!!<br />So sad that this writer is no longer with us.
B003F3NDWG|4.0|The shows were very entertaining.  The writing and the acting were very good.  It was the only season that I had missed, so it was great to catch up.  I am a fan of &#34;Castle&#34;.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I've enjoyed the US version of this modern retelling of the Sherlock Holmes saga, but now that I've seen &#34;Sherlock,&#34; I may have to rethink my position on Americanized takes on British series. This is nothing short of brilliant. Martin Freeman makes John Watson uniquely approachable with his troubled war veteran who may or may not demonstrate the lasting effects of a battle injury. This makes it all the easier for us to identify with him and to understand his fascination with Holmes. And Benedict Cumberbatch as Holmes...this may be the actor who captures Arthur Conan Doyle's troubled--and troubling--character better than any yet. He is at least as good as Jeremy Brett, who played Holmes brilliantly in the PBS series based on Doyle's stories. You never forget, though, that this is a retelling of the stories in a modern setting--and that is precisely why Cumberbatch is so amazing. He makes Holmes familiar and yet eerily unsettling, a thoroughly modern man who is still somewhat anachronistic...a genius who may or may not also be a monster himself. I recommend this series highly.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This take the power from my existing tv's USB port so no wire clutter. Can browse anything from Google Chrome or UTUBE. Doesn't work with Apple.. Nice picture quality!

B00BB3UYS8|5.0|Outview (The Inner Movement) by Author Brandt Legg<br /><br />Wow...where do I start in my review of this very intriguing and suspenseful novel? Murder, espionage, young adults so expertly working together to solve a crime, and exposure to unfamiliar concepts/ possibilities...at least to me. I have never before read a book based on the theory of reincarnation. \\"Outview (The Inner Movement)\\" by talented Author Brandt Legg certainly captured my attention from the first page to the last.<br /><br />It is wonderfully interesting to be exposed to the many past lives of the protagonist, sixteen year old Nathan Ryder, and the five mystics that aid him in his quest to get to the bottom of his father's murder and the mystery of what is presently going on in his life. He is being persecuted and is totally exhausted by his nightmarish dreams of dying or being murdered. This fictional novel is well-written and captivating with the author's creative explanations of living different lives in other dimensions...the concept of skywalking, the benefits of astral visits, and the unique idea of going from one portal to another to discover past experiences as well as the power of forgiveness.<br /><br />With the help of Spencer, a mystic who is able to guide Nate with his somewhat eerie \\"gifts\\", Nate soon discovers he is not suffering from some form of mental illness like he first imagined. He also realizes that his brother Dustin, who has been placed in a psychiatric facility for the past two years, is actually \\"gifted\\" just like him and their father before his untimely death.  Nate enjoys a great circle of friends who believe what he is experiencing and make every effort to help and protect him. There is an enticing cliff-hanger at the end of this book which is bound to attract many readers to return to Mount Shasta to find out exactly where Nate and his brother land...I, for one, am hooked.  Once you read this book, I'm sure you will be too. Very enjoyable indeed!<br /><br />Inspirational Author & Book Reviewer ~ Dolores Ayotte<br />[[ASIN:B00F6YPFAU Growing Up & Liking It]]tional Author & Book Reviewer ~ Dolores Ayotte<br />[[ASIN:B00F6YPFAU Growing Up & Liking It]]
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I enjoyed the entire series.  This was a great alternative to some of the stuff you find on TV and look forward to finding other series to watch.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This books provides insights to many office/ corporate office environment related issues & the tactful solutions Sheryl provide can be useful for both men & women.
B008Y729FU|5.0|A little dark not really for children, great acting, great plot, atmosphere similar to batman, Its one of my favorites!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|What's to say? The cast is awesome, the show is action packed and dramatic, and the characters so well written that even the bad guys sometimes have something to like about them. If you're into shows like Law and Order but want something grittier, more violent, and in your face...here it is.
B00005JKHN|5.0|This has been one of my favorite Disney movies growing up and am so happy to have found one in this condition and it was a special edition.  I took a gamble and ordered a copy that was used and had the description stating that it was like new.  The movie arrived prior to the delivery date and was exactly as the description said. :-)  Thank you.
B00DWFQ2N4|3.0|I bought part 2 thinking maybe, just maybe it would be a different experience than part 1. Sorry, But for me it was just a longer, longer drawn out rehash of part 1. Maybe I'm still wanting that sound from Future Sex Love Sounds but I keep getting disappointed. Each song sounds just like the last. The music, the falsetto's, the Uhs and Ooo's. And do we really need long extended versions? Or to put the 2 bonus tracks (Target Exclusive) on a second CD to think that your getting more than what it really is? No energy on this one.
B0000714BP|5.0|I LOVE this movie.  I mean come on how can you pass up seeing these guys in drag????  The movie was in perfect condition and arrived before the estimated date.

B000P5FH3K|5.0|I am a paralegal and while in school one of my professors and I would quote this movie all the time.  He used so many amazing scenes as examples to help us understand the importance of captivating and moving the jury but NOT going over the top and to NEVER underestimate the underdog.  FYI keep plenty of tissues handy.  Matt Damen gives a stellar performance from the very beginning.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|My son loves this app. It had several short cartoons embedded in it. I also can see so funny. Great one!

B00820N2JG|4.0|Funny movie! If you're a South Park fan you have to see. It wasn't what I expected but definitely worth the $$$ to rent!
B002VWNIAY|5.0|My mother introduced me to this movie 19 years ago and I have been meaning to get it for a long time.  I took a gamble on a used copy, but it was just as advertised, mint condition!!!.  It is great how many movies have used lines from this one, it just goes to show you that back then they really knew what they were doing and had pure talent.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love this game because it gives me something to do when i get on my kindle and when im bored and have nothing else to play or do

She is a living example of the principles she teaches.  She really cares about helping people overcome their NEEDLESS crap programing.

B008OW1S3O|4.0|I'd just discovered this band conveniently around the time the visited my city. I went to the show and fell in love with their chilled beats combining elements of  trip hop, chillwave, and rock.
B00FQAZ7PW|5.0|Epic album from an epic band.  Not a bad song in the bunch.  Getaway, MYM, My Father's Son, Lightning Bolt, Infallible, and Let the Records Play will have you moving.  Meanwhile; Sirens, Pendulum, Yellow Moon and Future Days are killer ballads/slow songs.

B006XF5BTG|5.0|I'm an experience bodybuilder (natural) and found this to be an excellent read.  the author has done his research, but has used his own trial and error as well.  Much of what he teaches are things that I have found to be true in making my own 20+ years of building my body, but for me it was great to have affirmation (to reduce my own trial and error which can be counter-productive long-term).  If you are a person training your body and sorting through the vast array of supplements, this book with save you money.  The author debunks much of what you will throw your money away on (trust me, I have) and guides you to what works.  I would definitely recommend this book to beginners but also to more advanced trainers.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Downloaded in the morning when my daughter woke up for school she just walked by my tablet. It made her late for school. I had to take it from her.
