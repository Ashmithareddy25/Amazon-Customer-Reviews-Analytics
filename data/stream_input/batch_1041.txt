B002JVWRAO|5.0|Have been hooked like an addict since the first episode!  My nine year old even watches with me now.  Sam and Dean are characters you can relate to and really feel for when something happens.  We love their Dad-John Winchester, Bobby( my sons favorite),Castiel, Ash, Pamela and especially Jo and Ellen. This series is the kind you can watch over and over and still see things that surprise you.  Even with all the odds against them- these guys still bring their \\"A\\" game every time.  Just a great show that I really enjoy watching.
B000UX6THK|5.0|Twenty Years after it first aired on television and it still astounds me how amazing this show was. Innovative; creative; unusual; and captivating.  The collaboration between David Lynch and Mark Frost created one of the best television shows in history.  While sadly the second season pales in comparison to the pilot and the first season, the show still holds its own.  I must also mention the genius that is Angelo Badalament's haunting score for both seasons (The soundtracks are still available and sold separately).  Without the music the show would not have been half as good or as compelling.<br /><br />This DVD collection is terrific. I really enjoyed the documentaries of the making of the Pilot and Season one and two.  The extras are pretty impressive and its interesting to hear David Lynch reminiscing with Kyle MacLachlan.<br /><br />Overall this Twin Peak-Freak is overjoyed with this collection!
B002JVWR0Y|5.0|I like it very much, the price was good and received it within days. I would order from Amazon again with no hesitation.
0553805371|1.0|I had high expectations when I bought this book. I saw the hype on Larry King, in the press, even an extremely positive review by Manjit Kumar (whom I really respect having read his books with great pleasure). All of this is for nothing! Please spare your time and your money and do not buy this book. You will be disappointed. It is just a regurgitation of old theories, in a disturbing style of popular- humorous science for dummies, except that there is no real science and the humor is very weak.   It is time for Mr. Hawking to stop writing these types of books, it is not only disappointing, but it is quite misleading for the young generation.

B003UYUR10|3.0|Prince Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) helps squash a city Alamut that appears to have been selling massive weapons for destruction. There he meets Princes Tamina (Gemma Arterton) who protects the great secret of the \\"Sands of Time.\\" - If you think I am about to give a blow-by-blow description of the story, you are wrong as the fun is to watch it unfold.<br /><br />\\"It is said some lives are linked across time. Connected by an ancient calling that echoes through the ages\\"<br /><br />The main actors, Gemma Arterton, and Jake Gyllenhaal are good at their portrayal of character. However, what really put this movie over the top are the veteran actors including Ben Kingsley and Alfred Molina who really go into their parts; they did not just walk through the movie.<br /><br />I only saw the Blu-ray version so naturally the film has great resolution and sound quality. I believe they had Blu-ray in mind during the making of this movie in Morocco. Do not bypass the feature extras.<br /><br />The game's a foot.

B0015ABRE2|5.0|In the second season of Dexter, our favorite serial killer Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) was mostly on the defensive, with Miami Metro Police on his tail, and off balance, bouncing between his girlfriend Rita (Julie Benz) and a woman who was an unbalanced possessive kook.  In a refreshing change, Season Three features Dexter, a police blood spatter analyst, returning to his dark ways of dispensing justice, targeting for death, those that escape punishment through the legal system.  The level of violence is elevated, as various characters have murder on their minds.  Spoilers are ahead, so proceed through the yellow warning tape at your own risk.<br /><br />There are a couple of major story arcs, one involves Rita's pregnancy, Dexter's marriage proposal, and the plans for their wedding.  Another concern is a multiple killer known as \\"The Stripper\\", so called because he removes large strips of skin from his victims.  Lt. LaGuerta's (Lauren Velez) investigative team is mobilized on this case, with Dexter's sister Debra Morgan (Carpenter) and her new partner Joey Quinn (Desmond Harrington) being the point investigators.  Newly promoted to detective, Angel Batista (David Zayas) is elevated to number two under LaGuerta.<br /><br />The biggest development in Season Three is Dexter's involvement with the Prado family.  First, while trying to eliminate a drug dealer named \\"Freebo\\", Dexter accidentally kills Oscar Prado, the brother of assistant district attorney Miguel Prado (Jimmy Smits).  Dexter eventually tracks down Freebo, but immediately after stabling him dead, and with a bloody knife in his hands, Dexter runs into Miguel.  A shocked Dexter confesses that he has sent Freebo to a better place, for which Miguel expresses his gratitude.<br /><br />It seems odd, but Dexter and Miguel quickly become close, and as do Rita and Miguel's wife Sylvia (Valeri Cruz).  Miguel connects the dots, and guesses that Dexter is a vigilante type killer, and expresses interest in helping him in his pursuit of \\"justice\\".  Eventually Miguel and a reluctant Dexter, collaborate on bold and daring kill.  On their next effort, it is Miguel who plunges the knife into the next victim.  An empowered and confident Miguel then goes solo, murdering a prominent attorney whom he has a grudge against.<br /><br />With an out of control partner, who knows too many of his secrets, Dexter is perhaps facing his stickiest dilemma.  Interwoven with the Prado storyline are a number of subplots, that mesh together fairly well, to produce an exciting and tension filled drama, with a number of twists and turns.  While often bordering on the edge of absurdity, the high quality of the acting performances helps to sell some of the more implausible aspects.  The cast as usual is extremely talented throughout, with longtime cast members, C.J. Lee, Zayas, and Velez all being outstanding.<br /><br />Jennifer Carpenter is very talented, playing the somewhat predictable and flawed Debra Morgan, a very determined cop, but not always in control, or possessing the best judgment.  While kind of a loose cannon, she does uncover several critical leads.  Debra leads with her heart, and it's usually not hard to predict who she's going to get romantically involved with.  Together with the spirit of her father Harry Morgan (James Remar), they provide the link to Dexter's past.<br /><br />That Julie Benz apparently had her breasts enhanced, is evident in the season's first episode.  In Season Three her character Rita, is mostly concerned with personal matters.  This was a good choice, as Dexter has plenty to deal with, and his heavy involvement with Rita and the kids in Season Two, left him little time for his deadly pursuits.<br /><br />Miguel Prado is a pivotal character, and also the most problematic.  An assistant district attorney willing to take the law into his own hands, who then forms a partnership with Dexter, is something that is rather hard to swallow.  Be that as it may, Jimmy Smits does a fine job of bringing some believability, to a challenging role that requires him to evolve quite a bit during the course of the season.  Smits performance is definitely crucial to the success of the third season.<br /><br />In the end, an unlikely partnership is dissolved, as the student learns much more about the subject of murder than he expected to.  The ending is a bit rushed, but Dexter makes the trip down the aisle in time, concluding another powerful and dramatic season.believability, to a challenging role that requires him to evolve quite a bit during the course of the season.

0762439009|4.0|Pretty good collection of stuff here. The mousepad is better quality than I expected and not one of those cheap kinds with the plastic-like coating, albeit a little thin. The small booklet has a lot of photos that I've never seen before. The coffee mug has a photo of The Dude and Walter in the diner on one side that isn't pictured. My only complaint is that the achiever certificate is folded into fourths. Recommended at the price.
0143118420|3.0|This book didn't initially interest me, particularly since it was done on contract, but it was assigned in my book group, so I dutifully read it.   I was somewhat surprised at how much I enjoyed it.   It didn't change my life, and I'm not quite sure why people rave over it as a font of wisdom, but it was a good story.   I was terribly frustrated when reading about Italy that it was too late at night to rush out to an Italian restaurant.    I found the parts about India and Bali very interesting, and reminded me that I really should try meditating.   I do wonder  what happens when book gets back to the subjects,   I wasn't surprised to hear that Gilbert's ex-husband is working on his own book.   There has been a lot said about this book, but I'd like to address two issues.    One problem that people had with the book is the issue of whether Gilbert was a whiner.   In part, this depends on the question of the nature of depression.   Some people argue that depression is a chemical imbalance that is only partially related to external events.   In some cases, depressed people seem to lack resilience: they are unable to recover from a sad experience.   If that was Gilbert's problem after her marriage, then it's a bit unfair to condemn her for feeling so miserable in the midst of what is really a pretty good life.   And I think Abraham Maslow was wise with his hierarchy of needs: your worst problem preoccupies you.   It's good to try to intellectualize and gain a little perspective and objectivity though.   That said, Gilbert does seem to claim that she spent three or four years sobbing on the bathroom floor, when little asides later in the book make it clear that she was globe-trotting and enjoying an active social life, over and above the problems of her rebound affair.   So I have mixed feelings on that.    I also realize that she was describing how she felt at the time.    By the end of the book, however, especially with all her spiritual development, I would hope shewould have gained a little insight and compassion for her ex-husband.  I know that many people think that I am cruel when I say this, but other people are independent from us, and they don't owe us either approval or forgiveness.    Gilbert decided to end her marriage, and I don't judge her for this, but she really needs is to let go of her husband and her desire for him to justify her.    She did what she thought she needed to do, but if she can rise above her ego in the course of her developing spirituality, she ought to be understand that he was probably deeply hurt and that he is entitled to his own reactions.  She tried to buy him off with money and he apparently was graceless enough to take advantage, but isn't that also a little insulting?    In India she has a mystical experience on the roof, and she says that her husband's \\"cool blue soul\\" met with her soul and they forgave one another.   If I were her ex, I'd be angry all over again at her having the gall to forgive herself on my behalf.   It is her desire for his approval that continues to cause her problems, and she needs to get over it.        I am reminded of one of my favorite scenes in Don Quixote: a young man dies of unrequited love and the object of his affection shows up at the funeral.   His friends condemn her as a murderess, but she refusing blame, asking whether love is voluntary or involuntary.   For if it is voluntary, then the young man could have chosen not to love her when he saw that she didn't love him.   And if it is involuntary, than she could not have chosen to love him, however he felt about her.    But that's how we tend to be: we think that our emotional wants are involuntary needs, but the people who frustrate us make voluntary choices.    I did have a good laugh to myself.   I'm about twenty years older than Gilbert, and about thirty-five years ago, a friend explained very firmly to me that between feminism and the sexual revolution, there would be no more neediness about love and sex.    When someone left a lover or spouse, the abandoned one would simply and calmly accept that and \\"choose\\" not to be hurt and upset.   Of course, the one doing the leaving couldn't have helped falling in love with someone new.   Which leaves us with rather a disconnect on the subject of love affairs and marriage.   If people criticize the lifelong commitment ideally associated with marriage as impractical, why are they so upset when their affairs end?   Wasn't one of the advantages of never marrying supposed to be the ability to break up and move on?   Ah, but we want to be the one who decides to leave, never the one who is left.   And if we are have any kindness, we don't like to think that we left someone sad and angry.
B00064WSNW|5.0|This was the first release of the newly formed KC quartet, you know who, and you know the tracks, this was an amazing debut, and seeing this tour live was a highlight of my concert going experiences; seeing it with other guitarists, we wondered if there wasn't someone off stage adding parts that seemed to come from beyond the two amazing guitarists we could see in front of us. We wondered, Adrian 'who' then hit the record store and found him all over, including buried in the details of discs we already had! Here is a player that works best in a group setting, his pop work with The Bears is great listening, and when he sits in he not only brings a uniqueness to the proceedings, but he does it by becoming one of the band, not just layering his sound on to the cut. Someone else described what happens when someone like the great Steve Howe lays down a guest track, it becomes a Steve Howe song. Though that is not a bad thing, or a slam on Steve (an all time favorite of mine) he is truly a guest on that song, whereas Adrian tends to become one with the band. An interesting ability not shared by many of the greats.    A great companion to this CD is the KC Collectible Volume 2: Discipline--Live at Moles Club, Bath, UK (1981), the band had yet to consider calling themselves KC, and the versions by 'Discipline' and the sound quality are top notch. You also get a second set of KC in Philly 1982, having polished up this gem and added some very nice touches to it. This is a nice disc to own for fans of this iteration.    Three of a Perfect Pair and Beat have their moments and are must for any fan of this line up, but they do not surpass this 'debut' of sorts. It is astounding how much more music this group has inspired me to pursue just for being a fan of theirs: Trey Gunn, Gordian Knot, Fuller, Tony Levin, The Bears, The Psychodots, Chris Arduser, Bruford's jazz discs, CGT, and many more from the Discipline family. Thanks for them all!
B003V5PPZG|1.0|absolutely terrible terrible album by Linkin Park.    I was a bit skeptical on amazon reviews, so i had to find out myself.    Boy..... i should've listened to you guys, this album was a disgrace. I kept switching song by song to see if I'll try to find something decent. Nope, it never came. Why change Linkin Park, just why? You guys were gods during the Hybrid/Meteora era, so why change?     why Linkin Park.. why..  Not to mentioned the material was just corney and Mike Shinoda's rapping(which i absolutely love) was just painstakingly brutal. I would be embarrassed to listen to this album in front of my friends. Hell.... I even despise Justin Bieber, but i would rather listen to his crap than to listen to 1 dreadful song in this entire album.
B0036TGSR6|4.0|This is a typical Polanski film. It is a piece of slick film making. The house at Martha's Vineyard is almost a character in itself: it is elegant but forbidding. Martha's Vineyard in the winter is cold and wet. The storms highlight the turmoil of the characters. The acting is great. There are good cameos by Belushi, Timothy Hutton and Eli Wallach. Olivia Williams is the strong and cynical wife. Brosnan does a great job as the prime minister. McGregor is very good. He plays the amateur detective who does not want to be involved, but his curiosity takes over. Kim Cattral as the assistant/mistress seems a little vague. The plot doesn't quite hold up, but it is interesting. The ending, as is typical in a Polanski film, is a slight let down, but he gets to the end with style and grace. He adds little Hitchcockian touches throughout the movie. The movie is a pleasant suspense movie without major explosions, car chases, or multiple gunfights. He builds the suspense through character development, plot and atmosphere.

B003VSVWA0|5.0|I downloaded the audio album.   (I have not seen the DVD, but I will.)  It is wonderful.  I am overwhelmed by it and moved to tears.  And, no, that doesn't happen often.  Yes, I am a Cohen fan, and I was privileged to see and hear him in this tour.  So, I don't claim objectivity.  It doesn't replace the Live in London CD/DVD, but it includes songs not in that collection.   And one or two versions are completely new to me.  Seeing him on stage, I thought the performances were fully rehearsed - and great - and would be much the same at every concert.  But I guess not.   This collection makes me wish I could have followed him around on the tour.   His backup musicians help make it the masterpiece it is.  They, too, are wonderful.    Leonard Cohen is a genius and one of the greatest living artists in any genre.   I can only listen to the music of two people over and over and never be disappointed or bored - J.S. Bach and Leonard Cohen.       I really am sorry to gush, but it's my honest reaction.   I wish Amazon allowed six stars.
B001HN69AY|5.0|I saw this video at a friend's house and was impressed by the creativity and vivid imaginations of the actors and directors. Johnny Depp is exceptionally versatile and his portrayal of characters is outstanding. Although this particular film was not well received in the box office, I think it rates right along with \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" of recent release. The imagery was fascinating. It's so much fun to let your mind expand with the imagery presented. I purchased a copy for my film library and watch it to catch details I missed on the previous viewings.
B000059XUI|5.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />Despite well-documented changes behind the camera for \\"Superman II,\\" the sequel is a brilliant piece of work.  Richard Donner was messily replaced by Richard Lester for this follow-up, which fortunately does include almost every major actor from the original film.  It is several shades darker than its predecessor, as Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor is overshadowed by three homicidal superpowered villains who manage to evade Krypton's fate.<br /><br />The villains represent a kind of unfinished family business for Superman because General Zod, Ursa, and Non were the very criminals his father had sentenced to the Phantom Zone at the beginning of the first movie.  Excellently played by Terence Stamp, Sarah Douglas, and Jack O'Halloran they represent a palpable threat.  The screenplay largely avoids any campy potential of the Superpowered Villains On Earth storyline, and presents a reasonably realistic edgy scenario.  As a violent rampage continues, an unknowing Superman willingly sacrifices his powers for the love of Lois Lane.<br /><br />\\"Superman II\\" is a genuinely compelling sequel whose dark tone predates the darkness of the modern superhero movie by decades.  Aside from that, it is a tightly-constructed movie that is very satisfying.
B001FB5634|4.0|After having read the book, I hesitated to purchase the DVD but am glad I did. The film followed the book pretty  much. A good story but very dark and not a film, or book, you'd want to see or read if you're experiencing mood swings or down feelings. Very well performed by the main character actors and supporting actors. HOpefully, by viewing \\"fictional\\" events such as this, we might, as a civilization try harder to avoid the horror of an apocalyptic end. Good for the \\"head\\" to see such films as this; will help sober you up.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Dexter is a fantastic show. Perhaps my favorite show on TV right now. The actors are all very talented, and the stories are cohesive, interesting, and always a \\"cut above\\" (tongue in cheek).<br /><br />I have only a couple of minor complaints about Season 4. First, I hated the unexpected ending. It wasn't really fair to the viewer, since there was absolutely no way to see it coming. Also, let's face it, what will life be like without Rita? She was awesome!<br /><br />Second, I thought that the romance between Capt. LaGuerta and Angel Batista was out of place and ended up being more of an unimportant distraction.<br /><br />But given those two minor shortcomings, the show was still incredible. John Lithgow (a.k.a. Trinity killer) was excellent in every way. The scene where he walks into the homicide department and Dexter sees him was tense enough to be cut with a knife (here I go again). In the first episode, I couldn't help but be reminded of how much of a departure this was from Lithgow's family-friendly films. Truly a talented, and dare I save brave, actor for taking on this role.<br /><br />Dexter continues to be a five star show. Count me as a fan!<br /><br />Written by Arthur Bradley<br />Author of \\"Handbook to Practical Disaster Preparedness for the Family\\"
B002ZG997C|5.0|Very violent but indicative of what would happen without enforced laws (by whom) and morals or lack of. Mr. Washington defines the character of Eli; very believable especially when looking for an image in the wilderness that has purpose and ideals. One needs to pay attention to the hints and allusions that Eli might indeed be stone blind in his trek across the nation. Then again, you can't be sure. The action in the film would satisfy the most ardent \\"shoot em up\\" but I didn't find it excessive to be pointless. Very stark and believable.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I got this as a gift for my Mom's birthday and she loved it! This CD is a great mix of music with something to suit everyone's taste. Susan Boyle has a great voice and she is a great inspiration to everyone to follow their dreams no matter their age or station in life. My mom loves her voice and is looking forward to her next album!
B001GCUO5M|4.0|DeCaprio continues to surprise me in his diverse roles. Although he is the golden haired boy in earlier films, he seems to encompass more maturity in this one. The plot twists are very good and keep you guessing as to what he is actually experiencing. Interest and surprise seem to always arise when the plot slows but overall, the film has a great pace and the cinematography was outstanding. A good evening's entertainment and a watch again film.
0307266303|4.0|First of all, let me say I thought this was one of the most suspenseful and compelling non fiction books I've read in a long time.  It's a great read, what with lots of running anecdotes, scientific research, real life characters, and the underlying story of the \\"big race\\"...it makes for a hard-to-put-down read.  I am a runner, by dint great effort rather than sheer enjoyment (meaning I force myself to do it because \\"it's good for me\\") but I think this book has given me some tools to push towards getting more pure satisfaction out of \\"doing what's good for me\\".  I always felt running was work, but after reading about these people and their obsessive dedication to the lifestyle of running, as well as the realization that we really are \\"born to run\\" I think I may be able to run for pleasure after all.
B003EYVXYQ|4.0|I finally got a chance to see this movie. I was scared at first, because of all the negative reviews it's gotten. Let's face it:  Fans were disappointed and savage in their criticism. People hated this film.    I didn't. Romero is as cynical and pessimistic about humans as ever. And that's an attitude I can get behind. We are the enemies in this movie--we kill each other more than the zombies do and with more malice. The zombies are almost an afterthought, actually. There's some gruesome gore, but it's played for laughs. The characters--even though some of them get bitten and eaten--never seem threatened by or afraid of the living dead, who are slow and stupid and, if you're alert, easy to dispose of. I liked that part of the movie. I'm firmly in the slow-moving zombie camp.    The plot revolves around two stubborn old men who live on Plum Island, which is off the coast of Delaware. Their families have been battling each other for generations and they have different ideas about how to keep themselves safe during the zombie apocalypse. What struck me as odd about that is the patriarchs both have thick Irish brogues. I could have bought it if everyone on the island spoke that way--sort of a linguistic anomaly like New Orleans' Irish Channel--but everyone else talks like an American. This implies that the old guys are recent immigrants. But they're not. Huh. Wha? I was confused.    A group of bad ass military types lands on the island and shakes the order up, all the while fighting zombies and, more importantly, each other. That's the plot in a nutshell.    Like all of Romero's movies, Survival is more about the humans than the zombies. There's almost-hope at the end for survival (get it?), but one of the mean old Irish patriarchs shoots the messenger in the head before she can deliver the good news (which I won't reveal). The moral? Humans suck; zombies eat us; maybe we deserve it.    Overall, this wasn't Romero's strongest offering. But it wasn't kitty litter either.Since he is such a God in zombiedom, the bar is ridiculously high for his work. With that kind of expectation, you're pretty much screwed. I'm gonna cut the guy some slack. Why? Because I love him.    Zombies are dead. Long live zombies. I hope Romero makes a seventh film. I will never trash the master.

0743289684|5.0|This is an amazing, eye-opening book about a woman who had lived most of her life as a strict Muslim believer.  It shows how she began to question aspects of this form of religion and also the culture that is a part of it.  It also describes some difficulties Muslims had in the assimilation process.

B000002J1Y|4.0|I bought Yessongs in 1973 when I was in first year in Architecture at uni in Paris.  For these boys with long hair (and a brain- apparently) it was the Bible to have, or you were out.  I was at that time with Frank Zappa, the Airplane and the Dead.  So Yes was a bit of a radical change.  The good thing about Yessongs is the general feeling, the energy that the band is able to communicate throughout the album.  It also sent me back to the roots, such as Stravinsky and I bought more \\"classical\\" albums because of Yes.  Yessongs' production is really like being there in front of them playing live - just for you.  I remember going back home after a hard day at uni and putting Side One of album One as a religious and therapy practice - only to feel the vibes of the journey through the album again, and again.  Then decades passed away.  I recently purchased Yessongs on CDs at Amazon since my turntable died - I was missing the experience.  Now it's with me again.  The sound is just like I remember it when I play the CDs on my HF set.  So it's a good test. Enjoy.
B00004U2EZ|5.0|I saw a few clips of Notre Dame de Paris-the musical,the Paris production,-on YouTube and loved the music and the show so purchased a DVD,and then 2 CDs-the French and English language versions. This is my favourite. I listen to it very often,the music is powerful and moving and the performances - fabulous. A must to have for musical lovers.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|\\"Viva La Vida\\" is a superb combination of composition, orchestration, instrumentation, chord selection, and mood. This is one of the all-time great recordings (in any genre). We may regard it as the album U2 has been trying to make ever since \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" --- if only they could get over themselves and focus on writing/recording quality music! While comparisons are unnecessary, \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" (also one of the great albums of all time) was written in the bright sunlight. \\"Viva La Vida\\" was written by the light of a full moon. Mystery . . . poetry . . . prophecy . . . this CD has it all, but mostly it's just GREAT music.
B002GY9F9K|2.0|.. be prepared to be disappointed, unless you are under 12 years old and watching your first fantasy TV series.    I've read the books, and although TG is a great writer I did not find his material original. His seeker series is a sort of adult LOTR, but you always know the heroes never die. Of course, the same is true of the TV series, except that the storyline of each episode is blatantly predictable.     It only takes an IQ above 10 and an attention span of 10 minutes to know how each episode is going to end.     The heroes are all supermodel material (with shiny white teeth), except for the Wizard who tries to dress like Gandalf.     The acting is mediocre at best, but this may be due to the god awful scripts. Why didn't they just stick to the professional script by TG, instead of getting a bunch of schoolkids to write each episode for them?    The Mord Sith (spelling?) are a complete joke. The exceptionally beautiful confessor always looks like she just stepped out of the beauty salon, and never gets her pretty white dress creased (nevermind she can fall down a riverbank and still look her clothes had just been retrieved from the drycleaners).    You get the idea - it's Hollywood gone overboard. It's as if the producers think they are shooting episodes of Baywatch, with the same scriptwriters.    Best bit is the eye-candy. The extra * is for the 1st episode, which was actually, not a bad introduction to the series.

0439023513|5.0|5 stars, definitely! This was the third in the Hunger Games trilogy and the story actually grew stronger throughout the three novels. I was particularly engrossed in the subplot of having two guys so in love with Katniss. She had such an easy way of switching between the two (love the one you're with). I knew this had to be resolved somehow. Would she choose one, both, neither? I was having a hard time, myself, deciding what I would do in her shoes. Ultimately a choice had to be made and I was completely satisfied with the resolution and the reasoning behind it. The abundant use of sentence fragments to reflect Katniss's choppy thought process still bothered me, but I had accepted this style mid-way through book 2. However, I was still pulled out of the story a number of times because of this style and I had to reread parts for a better understanding. Hate that. When it happens. Great story, though. Lots of blood and guts. Maybe too gruesome for 13 and under. See what I mean about fragments? Last comment: I can't wait for the movie.
0545123283|4.0|Linger by Maggie Stiefvater<br />Scholastic Press, 2010<br />360 pages<br />YA; Paranormal Romance<br />2nd in trilogy<br />4/5 stars<br /><br />Summary: Now Sam is a human and should be staying that way and everything should be great for Grace and Sam.  Instead there are new threats, from the newly turned wolves, from an angry hunter, from Grace's parents, from Grace's body itself.<br /><br />Thoughts: I saw mixed reviews of this: either people loved it or they didn't see the need of a sequel and thought the four narrators muddied it were the prevailing thoughts.  I was excited about the sequel as I really enjoyed the first book and thought it was beautifully written.<br /><br />I enjoyed the shifting perspectives and I liked that we didn't spend too long with any of them; I feel like that helps me read faster.  What I didn't like about the four narrators was lack of Grace.  I didn't track how long her sections were but it felt like there was a lot more Sam and Cole than Grace, who is my favorite character.  I do like Sam, who is wonderfully earnest and such a good guy, in comparison to a lot of other YA males.  But I felt like Grace should have been more of a focus and she wasn't.  I enjoyed meeting Cole, a musician and scientific genius who wants to forget himself entirely and be just a wolf.  He was such a jerk but if he can help, I want that.  Isabel also returns and has some chapters to herself.  She's in a very difficult position as she is struggling with parental problems of her own plus has her dad wanting to kill all of the wolves.<br /><br />Beck is still a wolf as in the first book but his presence is heavily featured in the boys' chapters and as I loved him in the first book, I appreciated that.  I also liked Grace's friend Rachel who was just a funny character throughout.<br /><br />I didn't like Grace's parents who have a lot to answer for in my book.  They spent years basically acting like Grace didn't exist or didn't need them for anything but all of a sudden, they interfere?!  And they get mad at Sam when it seems like he's in it for the long haul, and not just for sex.  Most parents I know at least try to get to know the person their child is dating.  I'm not sure what it is about him that they don't like.  And instead of trying to slow their relationship down, maybe by insisting that he spends more time with the parents so he can demonstrate his honorable intentions or by requesting that they spend more time in a group, they outright ban him.  Furthermore, it doesn't sound like Grace's grades have suffered or that she was acting disrespectfully toward her parents while dating Sam.  When they start ordering her around, that's when the disrespect starts and quite frankly they haven't earned her respect.  Because while one should respect one's parents, it's earned, not just taken or demanded.  They suck as parents.<br /><br />Plotwise, the main thread is Cole adjusting to life as a shifter and then Grace's ill health which seems to be due to her earlier bite from a wolf.  That last one ends on a cliffhanger that has me frantic for Forever.<br /><br />Overall: Interesting new characters and further development of characters from first book result in a good book.<br /><br />Cover: Love the green and how it connects to the blue; personally I would love purple for the next book.t seems like he's in it for the long haul, and not just for sex.

B003IWZ1D8|5.0|Do I really even have to get into detail? Just an amazing movie! I am sure everyone has seen it but this BluRay is a MUST! You will never have to buy another version!
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Wonderful movie!  At first, my husband thought it moved slowly, but by the end of the movie, he thought it was excellent too, and we've been recommending it.  This is especially encouraging for anyone with a disability.

0385342039|5.0|I have read every one of Kinsella's books- this one is by far the best. Well, the Shopaholic series is an entirely different story. In any case, I finished the book in three days. It was that good! I just kept turning the page. Like Kinsella's other books, this one is also an easy read. After reading this book, it became clear that Kinsella follows a formula for her stories: at the beginning, a single girl's career and love life falling apart, she discovers a problem, spends the rest of the chapters solving that problem in a way that redeems her character's flaws, and her career and love life are amazing at the end. Kinsella follows the formula in this book as well, and even though I knew Kinsella was doing it again, the story was so charming and funny that I couldn't stop reading. If you're a Kinsella fan, you won't regret reading this book.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|All I can say is that this show is fantastic. So engaging - always has me on the edge of my seat, biting my nails. Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki are great actors - something very rare for a show on the CW (or most TV, for that matter). DVD quality is great, all the episodes are great, and it has some nice bonus features. Bought it because I didn't want to wait for Netflix to get it to me. So glad I did!
B003MOHX8S|5.0|I stumbled across this album by mistake and I am so glad fate lead me to this. This is the best album to listen to while doing almost anything: waking up, getting dressed, driving to work, doing homework, running, weight lifting, eating a steak, killing a grizzly bear with your two hands, the possibilities are endless. You will not regret buying this.
081297381X|3.0|I'll start out with a brief summary.  The basic premise of the book is enlightening:  the things that most effect your life and history are things that are highly impactful but highly improbable.  This is called a \\"Black Swan\\".  The impact of the Web, 9/11, Katrina, the financial crisis, etc. are all events unforeseen, unplanned for, but had an enormous impact.      For most of the book, he resigns himself and all of us to accepting that we can't much plan for the future so don't try.  That's the part I'm not too fond of even if he has a point.  We can do some scenario planning as a society, as economists, etc. and understand that there are limitations.  I think we can also plan for _resilency_ in the case of negative Black Swans, which I think is too often overlooked.  In the second edition of the book, he has a postscript essay which, however, does offer some good suggestions.    Lots of good ideas in the book.  What makes it an unpleasant read is his ranting.  In the process of his exposition, he really disses economists (of which he is one) as being pretty much useless people.  There are a lot of people and a lot of professions he believes are useless.  Fine.  But saying it once is enough.    Worth a read.

B002N5N5M0|5.0|In typically Dexter form, the show continues along in the same gory, southern inspired path that the preceding seasons did. Michael C. Hall continues to bring honesty to the role with his short bursts of energy, mixed in with the obvious need to display a constantly calculating Dexter Morgan. John Lithgow is excellent as the antagonist of season 4, and by the time Season 4 has run it's course, viewers are left in disarray. By the end of this, you'll be more intrigued than ever to see what Season 5 will bring.  If your curious what happens in season 4, please resist the urge to search for the synopsis', and instead purchase it, and give it the viewing justice it deserves!
B0039TD7PY|5.0|I Love JT and Carole King, for them to release a CD together was a dream come true.  The CD does not disapoint.  Both artist are at the top of their game.  I recommend this CD for all JT fans.  Not sure what I was thinking first time around.  Thank you to whomever corrected me.
6305428522|5.0|This is a very classy telling of a true story based on the game show, Twenty One.  For a low budget film, it recreates the era and mood quite well.  All the acting is top notch as well as the production design.
0374158460|4.0|One might be forgiven for thinking that Jonathan Franzen  simply re-skinned his novel The Corrections to produce Freedom.  Same tangled Midwestern family dynamics, another aging hipster forced into painful life realizations, a murky eastern European business deal, fraught parent/child relations.  While both novels are preoccupied with modern American life, Freedom pushes past its predecessor by exploring the personal and political behaviors that collided during the W era.<br /><br />The characters feel like real people we would know and be exasperated by.  There's Patty, an ex-jock with brains, hauling around a cartload of childhood baggage.  She's married to Walter, an earnest liberal whose decency forms a tight lid over some boiling class rage.  Their son Joey is Mr. Cool who thinks he calls the shots with his girlfriend Connie until she uses some emotional judo on him.  Walter's best friend Richard is an alt musician whose stubbornness and narcissism begin to look like integrity after enough decades have passed.<br /><br />But this fulsome laying out of his characters' dilemmas comes at the expense of the plot, which is curiously perfunctory, particularly for a 500 plus page book.  Patty has the hots for Richard, but marries Walter.  Years later, they have to decide whether they'll scratch the itch.  Walter's save the environment goals get snarled up in the self-interested maneuvers of a philanthropic oil billionaire.  Joey becomes enmeshed in a tedious, barely credible scam involving Polish truck parts and the Iraq war.  The ending involves a tepid reconciliation and the same \\"people, can't live with them, can't live without them\\" summation of human relations that informed The Corrections.<br /><br />What makes the book worth reading is watching the characters work out the peculiar American dilemma of personal freedom.  Franzen, like Dostoievski and others, clearly believes humans can only handle so much personal freedom before they go off the rails.  Absent tradition and the oppressive hand of the State, Americans are free to flounder between the opportunity for unfettered personal expression and the need to rein it in so we can connect with other humans.  The characters in Freedom demonstrate that Americans are formidably skilled at both association and dissociation.<br /><br />Franzen deserves credit for tackling with verve and stylistic aplomb the tangled mess that is American culture at this particular moment.  While the book is too thin on original insights to be considered the masterpiece some are calling it, Freedom is a finely wrought, thought-provoking novel that deserves to be read and discussed.essive hand of the State, Americans are free to flounder between the opportunity for unfettered personal expression and the need to rein it in so we can connect with other humans.

B002ZG99NG|4.0|It was not a fluke folks, because it seems that Ben Affleck has some real talent after all. His directorial debut, Gone Baby Gone, was a very strong effort from behind the camera, but this time around he holds his own in front of it as well. It's not a great performance, but it's probably his personal best. Jeremy Renner, fresh off his Oscar nomination for The Hurt Locker, is the standout for me, but Mad Men's Jon Hamm is equally enjoyable in a different way. Blake Lively, of Gossip Girl fame (come on, I've never seen it), shows some real promise as an actress, but she didn't get as much screen time as the hype behind her performance would suggest. Chris Cooper and Pete Postlethwaite are basically give extended cameos, but they both make the most of it and leave a strong impression. Rebecca Hall was okay as the love interest of Ben Affleck's character, even though her role and acting seemed slightly flat at times.<br /><br />The city of Boston has been depicted well in movies like The Departed and Mystic River, but it comes to life and shines even more bright through Affleck's vision. I even had a little trouble understanding parts of conversations because the accents were that accurate. The story is pretty basic. Kind of like a mini version of Heat, but the locations and acting from just about everyone really draws you in. I can't forget about the action scenes. The bank heists are gritty, realistic, and at times, pretty darn suspenseful. Oh, how effective were those masks? I thought the skeletons were fairly scary enough, but those deformed nun ones freaked me out.<br /><br />The Town is just as good if not better than Gone Baby Gone. Inception may top my best of 2010 list, but Scott Pilgrim vs. The World and Toy Story 3 better watch their backs, because the more I think about The Town, the higher on my list it aims to climb.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I love this show so much, and the first season is definitely one of the best. It was a mid-season replacement, so it only has 9 episodes, but the foundation for the show is laid well in those few episodes. Lots of drama, interesting medical cases, laughs, tears, and heartbreak. Very good show.
B000LPQ6DE|2.0|I, also, am stunned at the many reviewers that loved this version.  I have just finished watching five movie versions and this is the only one I really disliked.  The dialogue is nearly completely rewritten (call me silly, but I love Bronte's words).  My biggest problem is with Mr. Rochester.  Toby Stephens is an excellent actor and I have enjoyed him in other roles.  But in this version he is stiff and unlikeable.  He is probably too good looking.  Having wild hair and holding his head at an angle does not make him Rochester!  Where is the tortured passion?  Ruth Wilson was adequate, but the whole thing was pretty awful.<br /><br />Here is my line up for all five versions:<br />1. 1983 with Timothy Dalton & Zelah Clarke.  The best Rochester ever!  A magnificent job by Dalton.  Clarke was also excellent and conveyed her feelings through her eyes.<br />2. 1973 with Sorcha Cusack & Michael Jayston.  I was surprised at how good it was.  Jayston's Rochester really grows on you.  Cusack smiled too much, but was basically good.<br />3. 1997 with Ciaran Hinds & Samantha Morton.  I really liked Morton's portrayal of Jane.  Hinds was a bit too crabby and it was difficult to see how she fell in love with him.<br />4. 1996 with William Hurt & Charlotte Gainsbourg.  It was better than I thought.  Hurt is not bad, but kind of creepy.  Gainsbourg was so \\"plain\\" she was almost ugly.<br />5. 2006 with Toby Stephens & Ruth Wilson.  Yuck!<br /><br />Yes, I am a purist.  The book contains some of the most beautiful and sensitive language ever.  I would wait for certain passages and would be often disappointed when the words didn't come or they were terribly changed.  But I really enjoyed watching these movie versions -- some more than others.
B003PGNBO8|1.0|\\"The New Lost.\\" I wonder how often we'll hear that phrase in the future, every time the next \\"High Concept\\" sci-fi drivel comes along? Because even though it's meant as hopeful praise by over-eager critics, it's this albatross that only leads to disappointment with the show in the long run. \\"Heroes\\" was described as The New Lost, right before it held its nose and dive bombed into the toilet after its first season. And then, of course, Flashforward, another New Lost, with it's chin-stroking premise and flashy, expensive opening episode. Which, as is now tradition, ran out of steam after that episode and spent the next 21 torturous hours wrapping itself in knots and boring everyone senseless before being rightfully drop-kicked into TV oblivion.<br /><br />So that all important premise first; everyone on the planet collapses and loses consciousness for 137 seconds, at which point they see a glimpse of their life six months in the future. Ooooh, how about that, then? Some people see nothing (gasp! They're dead! But how?) Some people see themselves with a different partner (gasp! But how?) and our hero Mark (played by charisma-vacuum Joseph Fiennes) sees himself surrounded by a wall of clues he'd collected in those 6 months whilst someone with a gun tries to kill him (gasp! But.. yeah, you get the idea). The most crucial clue of all was something he missed though. Buried among the scraps of paper and Polaroid pictures was, in my handwriting, the words, \\"ABSOLUTELY NO-ONE CARES.\\"<br /><br />And that is the killing blow to Flashforward. Original, intriguing premise aside, there is just nothing TO Flashforward. Everything that made Lost great, the reasons its the new benchmark for all future science fiction television, have all been, oh ho! \\"lost\\" in the production of FF. Interesting, believable, layered characters. Episodes packed with action, suspense, humour, sadness. Story arcs packed with twists, mis-direction and surprise. A need for in-depth knowledge of the show that rewards patient, dedicated fans. And, whatever you think of the finale of the show, Lost had all of these and more, and, crucially, Fast Forward has none of them.<br /><br />Like Heroes before it, things will happen in Flashforward. Buildings will explode, guns will fire, people will shout, people will throw themselves off buildings, that annoying smug idiot with the sick kid will be revealed as the guy behind it all, Joseph Fiennes will be tempted to, dun dun duuuuuun, DRINK AGAIN, causing him to, oh no, ACT A BIT), Joseph Fienne's wife will be as bland and boring as possible and.. oh God, it's a struggle even to write all of this. Like I said, things happen, but you will NOT care. Not a bit. You're only watching it because you've been told it's \\"The New Lost\\", you'll have been tricked into the (really pretty good) opening episode and you'll wonder why, deep down, you couldn't give a crap about any of it. Dominic Monaghan could devolve into Splinter, complete with pink bathrobe and walking stick, and you wouldn't even blink. You'll wonder why you can't remember any of these characters names. You'll be puzzled why you can't actually remember why certain people are doing certain things. You'll find yourself asking \\"who's this guy again?\\" And you'll wonder; maybe it's part of the overall Flashforward effect, the fact that the episodes last an hour and you curiously lose consciousness after the first 12 minutes, until you wake to the sound of the end credits rolling and another hour of your life gone up in smoke.<br /><br />Boring, 2D characters running around joylessly piecing together a puzzle that's not interesting in the first place. That's not great writing - that's just a waste of a good concept. With better writing, better characters and a pinch of a sense of humour could have made Flashforward another sci-fi triumph instead of yet another casualty. Still, never mind. I see that the 80s sci-fi classic \\"V\\" has been remade. Wow! How great is THAT going to be?<br/><br />Oh.

B002RWKSII|4.0|I have been a Beachboy/Brian Wilson fan for almost 50 years.  They caught my imagination in the 60s when I was a boy, and dreamed of the west coast life style.  I followed the group through the decades and attended many concerts to see them.  When Brian left the group and then resurrected his career, I was in attendance at his first concert in Ann Arbor Michigan and was blown away by his new band and new career.  Then came SMILE, the album we had waited for forever.  I saw him present it at Carnegie Hall, and it was as great as the rumours said it was since the mid 60's.  Lucky Old Sun proved that Brian could still compose great music.  This fascinating new Album, using the great music of Gershwin, with a twist from Brian and his crew is a very enjoyable album, although a bit inconsistent.  Some of the cuts are quite beautiful, others just good.  I would love to have more of Rhapsody in Blue than only the short bits here, but welcome them.  It does showcase Brian's ability to create great harmonies and interesting arrangments.  It should appeal to a broad range of music lovers.
B003U9TDII|5.0|Inception is one of the best and most original movies to come out in the last 10 years. The film is also kind of revolutionary and blew the minds of all who saw it. The soundtrack also blew my mind, but because it expertly blended adventure and emotion into a smoothie that still tries to bring me to tears every time I listen to it.<br /><br />Highlights Include:<br />Dream Is Collapsing<br />528491<br />Mombasa<br />Time<br /><br />Of course, the soundtrack may be most famous for its trailer music, but strangely enough, it only appears for a few seconds at the end of \\"528491.\\" There's hints of it elsewhere, but not in its true form. Not surprisingly though, the soundtrack works best when stuff is happening. Specifically, when the worlds and dreams are collapsing. Sure, when there's chase scenes too, but mostly when stuff is coming apart.<br /><br />Then there's \\"Time.\\" This is the track that makes me teary-eyed. Why? It's the music that accents the final scene, and incredibly emotional ones just like it. This is simply one of the best tracks from a score I've heard in YEARS. It starts soft, and then it builds. It builds for a good 3 minutes, getting louder each time, conveying a sense of escalating emotion or despair. It's a simple tune, repeated over and over, but it's highly effective. But then it crescendos, and gets softer with only a piano, highlighting the meaning of the spinning top and everything that has just happened and/or been experience. It's simply magnificent. Heck, my iPod says I've listened to it 72 times since I saw the movie, and it never gets old.<br /><br />Of course, there are negatives to the soundtrack though. There seems to be a lot of dead air, particularly in \\"Waiting for a Train.\\" It may work in the movie, but it's frankly a bit boring listening to it on its own, since there's really 9 minutes of nothingness going on here. Also, and this is a little nitpicky, but it kind of bugs me that the soundtrack isn't in order. That may just be me, but \\"We Built Our Own World\\" happens late in the movie. Not towards the beginning. Sure, they may be just themes of the movie, and not really scene specific, but it would be nice to have a little of this.<br /><br />Overall, Hans Zimmer crafts another winner here that perfectly accents a near-perfect movie. It may have a few problems, but it makes up for it out of its moments of sheer brilliance. If you liked the movie, or you're just a soundtrack fan, I highly recommend you at least have a listen.movie. Not towards the beginning.

B003XX2PPO|3.0|I read most of the reviews about this album and honestly I agree a little bit. Yes, some songs do sound like his old ones and Luismi should switch up his style. However, it wasn't really that bad I mean I liked 7 out 10 songs, which is pretty good for a 10 song album. I guess Luismi is scared that by switching his style he would lose some fans or maybe this is the only thing he knows. I mean not everyone who switches their style are going to be successful, but life is about taking chances. But who knows maybe the next album he will switch up, maybe if he gets enough criticism. Anyways, other then that I thought the album was pretty ok.
044654759X|1.0|Where did Nicholas Sparks go? This novel felt like a familiar Lifetime movie that you've seen a thousand times already. Predictable. Slow start. Unrealistic ending. The heart of the book was,not consistent w his other novels.  Hope this was not a sign of what to expect from a Sparks novel.  Extremely disappointed.

That being said this is one of the funkiest albums I have heard in awhile and I abosolutly love it.I love Muddy Waters, and I abosolutley love this album..

0786955570|5.0|I was around 11 when I first started playing D&D. That was back in the early 80's when the rules where a lot simpler and it was a magical time with a lot of fond memories I had playing with my friends.  We played for a few years but I haven't played since.  Now I have at 10 and 11 year old son's who I thought it was time to share some of the joys I had when I was there age.  I thought about breaking out my basic rule set, when I came across this game.  This is the perfect introduction to D & D for my boys.  Why is it you ask? We can complete a quest within 1 hour, No DM! I was able to enjoy the adventure with them, Simple rules.  We had a blast playing. They can't wait to play the next adventure. As for the product itself, it's fantastic, really good production values, awesome miniatures, heavy card stock, looking for the next game that come out in December. I highly recommend this game.

B003SWNRU2|5.0|The new singer is so compatible to the classic Accept sound that you do not even have to really think about it... just sit back and enjoy.  I found I liked the album immediately and each successive spin I am liking it more and noticing more.  I really think its a good 4.5 star release but since we cant give .5 ratings, I will take it higher rather than lower.  There is a classic Accept tone, vibe, sound, etc all the way through.  The only negatives I could say are that there is no massive stand out song (like a Balls to the Wall) and after a while some of the riffing and songs start to sound quite similar to others on the album... but... honestly, they are all good, so it is hard to treat that as a negative.  The guitars sound great and are what we have come to expect from Accept.  It is great to have them back as a viable band... UDO was dumb for not coming back, however, I am not sure they would have released as good a product with UDO (the last Accept album with UDO was just so so, in my opinion).  The new singer and producer both seemed to reignite and reinspire Wolf Hoffmann and the remaining Accept musicians into creating a great album to sit proudly along side their prior classics. Based on this album, going to see this lineup live their next US tour is now on my list of priorities.
0439023513|2.0|I had high expectations, but this book just didn't feel finished.  The first two-thirds was pretty good but then the end just fell flat for me.  Why oh why didn't Katniss ever stand up and take control?  Well, other reviewers have already said everything I have to say, and they've done it much better than I would have so I'll leave it at that.
B000CPGZHA|5.0|Kylie Minogue is another of those international stars that is somehow virtually unknown in the United States. Fortunately her DVDs are available in Region 1 format.  This show pulls out all the stops and covers all of her best songs.  Despite a risque troop of dancers including males in drag, she covers her material with style and grace in a way that appeals to all ages.  Despite her international fame Kylie remains humble and connects with her audience.  The only North American female pop star that comes close is Madonna.

Couscous the Algerian detective was definitely the one I loved the most.  Now that I have a toddler, I'm collecting an assortment of Richard Scarry books, including this one for sure.  Of all the books I had as a child, Richard Scarry's were my absolute favorite.  The characters and artwork are so charming, I really don't know how anyone could not love them!
B000O8OTNC|3.0|The serrated sharpener was half out in the clamshell pack, and when I opened the packaging and tried to push the sharpener back in it broke right off.  The blade sharpener works quick.  I have it hooked in my daily backpack.  It is very small and a bit awkward but it sharpens my pocket knives and multitool blades well. Not bad for 10 bucks, too bad it broke.

B000RJO578|5.0|Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is an exceptional and very gung-ho London police officer. He's earned nine commendations within the past year alone. He owns the highest arrest record, and has been wounded three times in the line of duty. And he's making everyone else on the metropolitan police force look bad. Rampant resentment in the work room leads to Sgt. Angel's reassignment to the cheery, rustic village of Sandford.<br /><br />To an intense cop who can't let go of the job, Sandford is a living hell in which nothing much happens, and it happens all the time. But looks can be deceiving, first impressions are sometimes wonky. In the friendly confines of Sanford hides a murderous conspiracy, and it isn't too long before our newest town bobby catches a whiff of the shady. It begins with a series of grisly accidents...<br /><br />It's a delicate balance, what these guys come up with, and it's fantastic to see the mad geniuses behind SHAUN OF THE DEAD marvelously live up to expectations with HOT FUZZ. The whole thing could have easily tumbled like a house of cards, but the writers and the director and the actors - especially the awesomely deadpan Simon Pegg - play it straight, which adds resonance to the story, makes the comedy bits so much the better. It helps, too, that there's this edgy flavor to the action sequences, an intensity to the chases and the gun battles and to Angel's run-ins with the killer in that black hood cloak robe thingee.<br /><br />Pegg and Nick Frost - who plays Angel's bumbling partner in this picture - continue that most excellent buddy chemistry they had going on in SHAUN OF THE DEAD and even in the British television comedy SPACED. In a neat twist, Pegg abandons his patented sad nerd persona for that of an unflappable, unstoppable supercop. Meanwhile, ex-007 Timothy Dalton comes in as the diabolical villain of the piece. I like these topsy-turvies.<br /><br />You can appreciate HOT FUZZ either as a rollicking send-up of buddy cop pictures or as an action thriller in its own right, or even as both. The film earns its slickness via its rapid-fire edits and ungodly loud special effects, especially when it arrives at the final act as our hot fuzz and a cadre of heavily armed perps shoot it out in the quiet streets of Sandford and then in the supermarket aisles. There is also a swan. It's that kind of movie.res or as an action thriller in its own right, or even as both.

Top it off that both my wife and daughter enjoy the \\"eye candy,\\" and I actually get to watch the show without being interrupted with unrelated conversation. There are belly rolling moments with high tension, but ALWAYS a twist to keep your imagination going. In short, this is an awesome program with all the perfect ingredients for a long run.

B003SWNRU2|5.0|Wow, this cd rocks hard.  I was a little hesitant in buying this new disc. Afterall, it's been 15 years since their last release and they have a new singer.  My friends, put all hesitation aside. This quite easily gets my vote for heavy metal Album of the Year!  Every song is a perfect blend of brutality and insightful lyrics. I love every song on this cd.  The songs clock in on average at about 5 minutes long with classic, strong guitar solos.  It is packaged with song lyrics, photos and a brief summary as to how this new onslaught took place.  Forget comparing singers..just enjoy it for what it is.  Keep an oxygen mask nearby...you might need it!  Well done Accept!!  THIS IS THE BEST METAL CD OF ALL TIME!! ONE YEAR LATER AND I AM AMAZED HOW POWERFUL THIS VOCAL PERFORMANCE IS  THANK YOU ACCEPT FOR CREATING A MASTERPIECE!!!

B002RSDW80|2.0|More mannered Meryl, quite acceptable.  But did they do some CGI to make her look taller?   I usually like Amy Adams, but feel she was wasted in this movie. Stanley Tucci is incomparable, as usual.  I couldn't figure the link between the Julia of the 1950s and the present day cook. Well I could really, but I didn't believe in it.  I think it would have been more interesting as a straight biopic.  At least the movie had the honesty to state that Julia Childs herself would have nothing to do with it. Well done!

1416596097|3.0|.    I haven't read a Le Carre in quite a while, indeed, I haven't really enjoyed any since The Russia House.  However it was a pleasure to return to this novel,  the dialogue and the description of the cut and thrust of meetings, what is said, unsaid and meant is what makes the novel.   The  plot deals with the War on Terror, with its offshoot in Chechnya being the link back to the cold war.  This time the main protagonists come from the German spy agency, with the British and Americans with walk on parts.  The familiar themes - in particular the sins of the fathers - are there in abundance;  we can guess from the outset that the sympathetic spymaster Gunther will be betrayed, as will almost anyone with whom we develop any  sympathy.   Tommy Brue is the standard feckless Englishman, sympathetic, almost heroic, and lost.   The weaknesses are more to the fore than usual, the female character Annebel is almost totally one-dimensional (she reminded me of Charlie in the Little Drummer Girl) as is usual with Le Carre.  He does manage to give some depth to Erna, Gunther's sidekick, but she is marginal to the plot.  However the central character Issa is similiarly one dimensional, though I presume this was intentional, as he is literally a vehicle.     I was intrigued by the description of the Imam, who is described as only 5% evil.  I thought this was quite subtle.   Indeed the intervention of the American's in the end is seen as brutal, but regretted as unsubtle in terms of tradecraft, because of the possibilities of playing the imam.    At this point I regard le Carre in the same category as PG Wodehouse - the storylines are mild variants of familiar plots; the characters are both familiar and superficial; the gift is in the craft of the storytelling.  I hope this doesn't sound like  faint praise, I think he's truly a great storyteller. However perhaps the limitation is in the scope of his imagination.

B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I was at Leonard Cohen's concert in Lissadel, Sligo, home county of W.B. Yeats.  Len quoted from Yeats at the concert.       He went through the set that's played on this CD.  He was courteous and humourous,  but most of all calm.  He introduced each of the musician's (twice), in a measure of deep respect.  Sharon Robinson was acknowledged as collaborator on a number of songs,  and the backing singers were introduced as `the Incomparable Webb Sisters'.   As you might expect from someone of Len's age, there were not many theatrics on stage, he wore a buttoned up suit and, towards nightfall, a scarf as well.  The weather was typical for North West Ireland, overcast and scattered showers.  However the performance was magical, the musicianship exquisite;  Len even made a few jokes about his own golden voice.  The crowd was (like myself) middle aged; and the venue was done up for outdoor concert comfort  - indeed the most irritating thing for me was that people continued to get up and get hot dogs etc through the performance.     Nonetheless an experience;  a great memory to have.  The incident that comes most to mind is the Webb sisters doing a cartwheel on stage; enormously incongruous yet hugely entertaining.

0307454541|1.0|Another crime series, another blank.  I liked Wallander on the TV so I thought I'd try this (I know its not the same author).  I loved the opening, bleak and intriguing - someone unknown  keeps sending flowers on an anniversary; and the opening chapters are engaging also, there is a central mystery to this book that is keeps your interest.  As part of the plot it is necessary to get to know every family member of a wealthy, extended and dysfunctional family.  I found this dragged (and turns out not to be necessary).  Once you know the ending the false clues and dead ends of the plot can be considered quirky or exasperating (I'm in both camps, but not simultaneously).<br />I think the author mirrors Conan Doyle, in having Mikael  Blomkvist as Waston, narrating and sometimes driving the plot. Where Doyle has Watson marrying three times (surely an oversight due to serialisation) Larson has Blomkvist sleep with three women in the book;  we see most of the story through Blomkvist eye's and indeed he is morally correct in terms of fighting corruption etc. However I could not get past his sexual amorality.  Perhaps more interesting (though less credible) is Lisbeth Salander, the Holmes character, she is autistic, extremely computer literate and possessing extraordinary ability to tap computers and phones.  This provides the plots key turning points, and the ability to unlock the mystery.  Salander is sexually humiliated in the plot, and the book took a very sordid turn through her character.  While a victim, she is also able to furnish details, without qualm, which enable the assassination of the main badguy in the plot, by his criminal associates.  Oh dear, Conan Doyle would not have approved.<br />Like a stage drama, the book has a main ending, but comes back for two encores - the mystery is solved, revealing more sordid family history; the killer kills himself.  Ok done deal, but Mikael's nemesis is firstly exposed as corrupt, and then assassinated (with help from Salander) and finally the flower-sender is revealed and turns out to be a white knight.<br />In the end I thought this was a pantomime, Blomkvist at one point in the novel says `This isn't a celler novel, after all'  Oh yes it is, a sordid, amoral one at that.  I won;t be back.d finally the flower-sender is revealed and turns out to be a white knight.

0753801728|4.0|This novel is set in post World War II Germany and traverses a number of different and difficult issues.  In the first part of the novel, Michael Berg is taken ill in the street; Hanna Schmitz helps him and this seemingly random act of kindness changes both their lives.  After this chance encounter, Michael, aged 15, embarks on a sexual affair with Hanna, aged 36.  Amidst the raw physicality of this relationship, Michael reads to Hanna.  And then, suddenly, Hanna leaves without warning.  Michael's consequent self-doubt scars him for life.<br /><br />`Often enough in my life I have done things that I have not decided to do.'<br /><br />Some years later, Michael encounters Hanna as she stands trial for war crimes.  Can he reconcile the Hanna he knew with the woman on trial?  Hanna's past and Michael's present serve to exemplify the tension between the generation who were adults during World War II and those born immediately afterwards.  This novel may have been written primarily for a German audience, but the issues are universal.  All actions have consequences, regardless of personal circumstance.<br />In the third part of the novel, while Michael comes to terms with what has happened, there are still broader questions left hanging for the reader to consider: how do individuals come to terms with their pasts; and how do nations deal with their involvement in events such as the Holocaust?<br /><br />I did not enjoy this novel: the issues raised are uncomfortable and I found it difficult to empathise with either Hanna or Michael.  And yet, I find myself still thinking about those issues, the decisions that we make as individuals, the bases on which we make them, and the consequences.<br /><br />`What would you have done?'<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith

Not willing to give up, I gave it a couple more listens and have to tell you it's a pretty good cd.  There are a couple of songs I'm not really into (too country), but overall a great effort by Brandon.
0307577589|4.0|When I at first thought about reading this book I purchased it in hard book form and started reading it. I stopped after about the first chapter as in any book reading for me if it won't hold my attention I will put it down, which I did. By looking in the local paper I could see that it was on the best seller list as number one. So I decided to purchase it in CD form and try it that way. I was happy that I had tried it this way as it turned out to be a good read. I think if I had gone on to read past the first chapter in hard book form that I could have read it ok. I will buy more of his books as I enjoy them quite a lot.<br />Thanks Gene Harless

B003Y5HWJU|5.0|When HBO first announced the showing of Boardwalk Empire, my calendar became marked with  bright red highlighter.  Every time I saw an image of actor Steve  Buscemi in his dapper 1920's attire (my favorite decade in American history), my anticipation grew.  I began to research, realizing that Martin Scorsese and producer Terry Winter (The Sopranos), and I was nearly breathless with anticipation.<br /><br />What drew me to Boardwalk Empire?  It was a combination of items.  I love the 1920s.  There was a romance to that particular era, evident in the films, the clothing, and the music.  America was blossoming from a gawky teenage girl and into the full flower of beauty during that magical era.  Much of the growing process involved film, music, gangsters, and Prohibition.<br /><br />When HBO's  BOARDWALK EMPIRE premiered, I was as giddy as a kid on Christmas morning.<br /><br />Scoresese and Winter didn't let me down.  Boardwalk Empire chronicles the life of Enoch (Nucky) Thompson (Steve Buscemi).  Nucky Thompson is slick, smooth, and runs the Boardwalk with a suaveness that rivals the cunning of a fox.  I don't think Scoresese could have found anyone better than Buscemi to play Thompson, for he's able to emit the perfect persona with his sly, crooked smile and darting eyes.  Yes, Buscemi fits my image of a gangster of the era, more realistic than any Hollywood has ever attempted to portray in the past.  Buscemi is not a handsome man, instead he has that down home reality to his features that makes him more believable as a human being with every close-up that is filmed.  Human is what Nucky Thompson is, aspiring for more on the boardwalk.  Nucky is complex in his greed and maneuvering, and all the while revealing the little bit of a compassionate heart that he still has beating within him.  This heart is shown in his behavior toward Margaret Schroeder (Kelly MacDonald), a pregnant woman who endures a horrific beating from her drunken husband.<br /><br />The storyline of Boardwalk Empire leaps from section to section, high paced, filled with action and the underground gangland activity that was so prevalent during the time.  There are startling little bits of history that will make any fan of the era and mobster history smile with pleasure.  My favorite clip was a war scarred Jimmy Darmody ( Michael Pitt) having a conversation with a very young Al Capone (Stephen Graham), while they waited to drive their bosses about town.  (No, Al Capone didn't start out his gangster career as the headman;he started at the bottom).<br /><br />My overall opinion of Boardwalk Empire--Excellent and stunning.  I felt as if I had been drawn into a perfectly portrayed world of the past, from the movements of Prohibition, Women's Suffrage, and into the realm of organized crime.  Beautifully written for the screen (adapted from the book by Nelson Johnson, Boardwalk Empire: The Birth, High Times, and Corruption of Atlantic City), Boardwalk Empire is a must have in your mobster collection.rom section to section, high paced, filled with action and the underground gangland activity that was so prevalent during the time.

0545310601|5.0|Mockingjay is the third and final book in the Hunger Games trilogy, and again, author Suzanne Collins, leads expertly straight into the story, weaving just enough reminders into her character's thoughts to bring readers up to speed without needing to slow the action to explain. The author has an amazing talent for clarity in a complex tale, for balancing showing and telling, and for describing action and introspection each with fearful intensity. She keeps the reader glued to the page, and keeps Katniss Everdeen vitally, powerfully real.<br /><br />In a story where the teenaged protagonist has been blessed with many possible futures, it's fascinating to follow Katniss's path as it narrows down to one. Reader and character switch favor between the two love interests, Gale and Peeta; the one ever-faithful, ever-sure, somehow undemandingly demanding; the other so deep and true and then so wounded and frighteningly false. Meanwhile the world is faced with its own different futures, staying safe under Capitol rule, or following the rebellion. But no choices are ever as simple as they seem, no truths as powerful as the fictions the media creates, and no futures as sure as hope would have us dream.<br /><br />Katniss may be free, but she's still bound and still playing in the games. The big question now is who's pulling the strings, and what future do they plan. I love the way Katniss alternates between playing and choosing her part. I love the flawed characters that offer her hidden nuggets of wise advice. And I love the breadth and depth of the author's world, its parallels with ours, its questions, its certainties.<br /><br />Like each of the other books, the game's the thing, drawing reader and Katniss inexorably in, then twisting and turning while she looks for a hidden exit all her own. When she finds one, it startles and delights and is, as always, disturbingly right.<br /><br />This trilogy is good. This book is good. \\"Real or not real?\\" Definitely real.

0316067938|4.0|At last, Breaking Dawn is out in paperback. Eclipse convinced me that this series was getting more absorbing with each new book, so I was eager to get my copy of this  but unwilling to pay hardback prices. It was worth the wait. Author Stephanie Meyer portrays the action through two pairs of eyes again, as in Eclipse, using Bella's for most of the tale, and Jacob's for that part when she's so clearly unable to think straight.<br /><br />I loved the interactions between Jacob and the vampires. The insults fly like fur quite convincingly, but powerful  relationships are developing too, and even when trust is too much to ask for, shared concerns bind vampire and wolf in uneasy compromise.<br /><br />Love and marriage are convincingly told. The dramas of hope and family unfold. Time-bending, species-blending terrors bring reminders of the past in a story that neatly folds back on itself. Meanwhile the enemies of New Moon face off against the allies of Eclipse. The author's world is convincingly peopled with an array of characters, flawed, determined and fascinating, bringing a wealth of moral dilemmas with their history and myth. And soon the stage is set for a final, vital confrontation.<br /><br />Oddly, the only flaw in the reading for me was that final confrontation. Maybe I was just reading too fast, too eager to reach the conclusion. A less impatient reader might love the scene as the armies gather and face each other. But for all my frustration at the outcome, I still find myself wondering while driving the car, did she... was she... could she... is that how it happened? The scene, for all that it frustrated me, is firmly stuck in my head, which I guess means the author wrote it powerfully well.<br /><br />So, yes, the series does get more absorbing with each book, right to the end. If the fascinating eyes of vampires fail to inspire you on reading Twilight, don't let them put you off. The books may be big, but the reading's pleasantly quick, and the story has lots of twists and questions, absorbing characters, excellent narrators telling their tales, and a fine conclusion well worth waiting for.rbing characters, excellent narrators telling their tales, and a fine conclusion well worth waiting for.

The book really should have been about 1/3 of it's current size.  As others have mentioned (but still worth repeating), this novel is in serious need of a good editor.  Too many long-winded descriptions, unbelieveable characters with superhuman abilities and numerous implausible coincidences all contributed to my extreme dislike of this piece of work.  I'll pass on book 3.

B0013527I4|5.0|I was overjoyed when The Muppet Show was released season by season on DVD.  I had bought the Time Life \\"best of\\" series on VHS (and then on DVD), but to have the complete series--wow!  Now, I'm waiting patiently for Season 4 to be released. . .      I also think that the fuzzy covers are a particularly nice touch.  :)
0316098337|5.0|I was a bit reluctant about this book, but it was getting wonderful reviews so I downloaded it to my iPad.

B000002C2E|5.0|What a great CD.  Dylan is truly a genious at songwriting.  Not a bad song on this whole thing. Some songs just roll along so easily and are hauntingly beautiful.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|\\"Room\\" is an intensely heart-wrenching book. Never have I cried so much from reading as I did with \\"Room\\". Perhaps it's because I'm a mother and perhaps it's because I cry easily, but whatever the reason, I spent most of my reading time with a tissue in hand.<br /><br />The story is told through the eyes of five year old Jack, a precocious, cheerful boy. Just within the first few pages, I fell in love with Jack. What a precious little child! The innocent and matter of fact way that he describes his world is endearing, charming, and also refreshing.<br /><br />Jack lives in Room with his mother, Ma, who was kidnapped before she became a mother, and the two of them are imprisoned in Room. She gave birth to Jack while in captivity, and Room is the entire world to Jack. You'll have to read the book yourself to find out more.<br /><br />The writing is captivating; I couldn't put the book down. The author's portrayal of Jack is powerful and convincing. I saw the world just as Jack saw the world. I had sentimental attachments to Meltedy Spoon just as Jack did. At the same time, I sympathized deeply with Ma, who impressively raised Jack in such a dangerous and difficult situation.<br /><br />The entire novel is well-structured. The one word chapter titles are clean and sensible. And even though I wanted to read more just because I loved Jack so much, I found the ending to be perfectly satisfying. There were a couple elements towards the end that seemed slightly unrealistic to me. However, I completely forgive the author, because I believe those elements were artistically necessary to bring closure to the story.<br /><br />Although this book ranks among the best in my opinion, it isn't a book for everyone. It's very hard emotionally, so you have to be prepared for that. There is also the minor detail that Ma still breastfeeds a five year old. This didn't bother me at all when you consider the situation they were in. But I suppose that some would find it too icky. If you can't get over that fact, then maybe this isn't the book for you. If you can deal with an emotional book with the minor detail of breastfeeding, then I highly recommend this book. It is truly like nothing else you've ever read.n't the book for you. If you can deal with an emotional book with the minor detail of breastfeeding, then I highly recommend this book. It is truly like nothing else you've ever read.
074322454X|5.0|Could not put this book down.  Riviting.  You become so invested in each and every man you'll read about. I read the book before I saw the mini-series and loved both of them very much.  Glad that we have this written material to remind us of what has taken place in history.
0316789798|5.0|This is the 1st book that I bought from Ed Emberley's series. My pencil drawing skills are rather poor but I was able to catch-up with all the drawings from book without hassle. Drawing steps are clearly presented and easy to follow. My kids are enjoying as well. Simple, fun and veeery addictive. I'm gonna buy more books from E. E. series for sure. Highly recommended!
0375507256|5.0|The rule is you must master - master, I say -  the basics to have value improvising. Mitchell has done this and more, and so has earned the right to produce something as unique as Cloud Atlas.<br /><br />As some have said before - not for everyone. Its structure took me a good third of the work to become comfortable with. Science Fiction? Yes, sort of. Social commentary? Yes, certainly. But without irony or sarcasm.<br /><br />This is a hymn to our connectedness as humans down through the ages, and a canary in the coal mine as regards our relentless push towards more and more consumption, and corporate welfare.<br /><br />It is work of a sort to read this, but immensely rewarding in the end.

B003UYV08E|2.0|Hollywood's current obsession with taking comic strips conceived in the 1950s for pre-adolescent boys by men who've never really grown up just demonstrate how juvenile and childish our society has become.  The current studio system -- big budget and big bang for teenage boys -- has made Marvel into an empire, and now that it's obvious Hollywood has milked each individual comic it's time for cross-overs.  We saw Iron Man appear in the final scene of that colossal waste of time called \\"Spiderman 3,\\" Silver Surfer appear in the movie that shouldn't have been called \\"The Fantastic Four 2,\\" and now \\"Iron Man 2\\" hints darkly at an Avengers movie series.            There's really nothing to recommend watching \\"Iron Man 2\\" (I watched it on the airplane, and I still couldn't stand it).  Robert Downey is the most charismatic actor on the big screen right now (even more so than Johnny Depp) but even his charisma can't sustain a movie with stupid dialogue and a ridiculous plot.  Iron Man was always one of the least popular of the Marvel comics.  X-Men and Spiderman were popular because those characters had human flaws and teenage angst -- but Tony Stark is a handsome billionaire.  You don't want to spend time with him, and you don't even want to throw him off a cliff because he'll just fly up and mock you.      Hopefully, this will be the last \\"Iron Man\\" because there's really nothing you can take the character and the plot.  Unfortunately, that's not how the Marvel empire and Hollywood work.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Clint Eastwood's latest film is one of his best ever, as he directs and stars in an updated \\"Unforgiven\\"-style drama. The acting is well-done, from Eastwood himself to the other actors. SPOILER!!! The final confrontation scene, while sad, is intense, and at the same time, the only appropriate way for the story to go. SPOILER OVER!!! See it. It's so worth it. Rated R for language.

B003CIG7AE|4.0|\\"Infinite Arms,\\" the third album from the traveling minstrels Band of Horses, focuses on relationships, particularly on the pain, confusion, and haze following their dissolution, and mortality. The layered, sometime lush effect of the way the recording is engineered echoes that sort of mental state, the way one feels wandering around lost after your significant other has moved on without you.<br /><br />The hazy, swirling guitars and complimentary rhythm and keyboards may suffer a bit from overproduction, but I actually like the fuller sound of this album better than the more stripped-down earlier ones.<br /><br />It's really hard to keep any number of these songs from floating around the recesses of one's brain if you listen too much, but there are rewards here from taking some time to just listen through a decent stereo to one of many very good recordings to be released in twenty ten.

B00127RAJY|5.0|Jillian Michaels' workouts REALLY work.  I had been doing her \\"Banish Fat Boost Metabolism\\" for months and finally decided to have more variety and I bought this 30 day Shred and No More Trouble Zones.  Before doing her tapes, I was mostly doing the elliptical machine...I saw minor results, but once I started doing BFBM I really saw a change in my body.  I didn't lose much more weight (I wasn't dieting), but I totally toned up and for the first time in many years, I like looking in the mirror at my body!  But don't be fooled...they're HARD!  But enjoyable because she's not a sing-songy, overly rah-rah cheery instructor like many videos are.  She tells it like it is.    What I like about the workouts on the 30-day Shred is that they are just 20 minutes.  I know I can survive through that!  I did Level 1 several times and just last night thought I was ready to move to Level 2.  Well, several times I said to the TV, \\"Are you kidding me??!\\"  But again, only 20 minutes, so I did it!  It was really hard, so I fear Level 3!  But I was sweating like crazy and know I will see results.  I think truly you're supposed to do these everyday, but I workout every other day and that's working just fine.  Good luck!

B002ZG99NG|5.0|I've never been a big fan of Ben Affleck, but if this movie doesn't win the Oscar for best picture, it will be a crime. It's every bit as good as past winners like the Hurt Locker and The Departed. It's non-stop action with a love story mixed in, so women will enjoy it as much as men.
B001RPD06I|3.0|When I bought this I wasn't paying attention. I saw the great price and added it to my cart. It was my mistake and not the card's fault. The card itself works as it should.    So just to point out, in case you are like me, this is a class 2 card. Class 2 is very slow. Copying 15GB of data to this you need to leave it, go to sleep, get up and go to work and come home. This is using a good quality (sandisk) USB 2.0 card reader. This speed is also evident on my phones.     I have since replaced this with a class 6 card and recommend it instead.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Nice set of lightweight headphones.  For the price I was kinda shy about buying them but its worth every cent.  they sit comfortably on the head, cloth padding to combat sweaty ear syndrome, and most importantly, they have amazing sound quality.  I was literally blown away, playing MW2 on the PS3 w/ these gave the game a whole new dimension.  I didn't know there was so much to hear.  Every single detail, kudos to Infinity Ward for mastering such a complete sound experience.  Buy it.  No regrets.  I would probably pay extra for a battery powered option but with the amount of tech in these i understand why its necessary for it to be wired.  the amp is inline and powered off the USB connection that handles the the microphone / chat aspect while the audio feeds off the RCA cable tap.  req's the switching of the audio output from the HDMI to the RCA, under the audio settings in the ps3 menu.
B0000AUHPK|3.0|Although I love this movie and it's music, I was very disappointed by this version. I did not feel the love, passion and connection I expected from these two wonderful actors. I hear there is a better version in the 1970's. I'll have to watch that one now...

Have read the first two books in the trilogy, will be reading the 3rd book this week.  I have to wonder about anyone who gave this book less than a stellar review.  They probably read James Patterson's books and love them.
B001RCD2DW|4.0|These headphone need a decent headphone amp and DAC to make it sound great. Running it straight from an iPod will not do these headphone justice.

B0010AN7Z4|5.0|THE APARTMENT stars Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine, and Fred MacMurray.  THE APARTMENT also includes Edie Adams, who played the part of the devil in DAMNED YANKEES.    THE APARTMENT concerns a love triangle between an older top executive (Fred MacMurray), a twenty-something elevator operator, and a young and intelligent accountant (Jack Lemmon).      FRED MACMURRAY.   Fred MacMurray is a married man with a couple of young sons, but his interests have gone seriously wayward, and he has been spending several months courting the elevator girl.  Fred MacMurray's acting in many of his movies, in my opinion, is somewhat wooden and he seems to be a robot, where somebody else is putting words into his mouth.  But in THE APARTMENT, Mr.MacMurray's acting is more genuine.  Throughout the story, he plays a sleazy dilly-dallier.  The narrative is made especially spicey by the snooping and gossiping of Mr.MacMurray's executive secretary, who eavesdrops on Mr.MacMurray's telephone calls.    JACK LEMMON.  Mr.Lemmon plays a highly articulate batchelor, with the mannerism of making quick gestures.  These rapid gestures make him appear more intelligent.  He lives along in his \\"batchelor pad\\" and he dabbles in Italian cooking.  Mr.Lemmon also operates a tryst-house.  For reasons not explained in this story, Mr.Lemmon schedules trysts involving various male employees from his company, and their girlfriends.  During these trysts, Mr.Lemmon strolls about the neighborhood, often late at night, and lurks out of sight to the side of the stairsteps of his apartment building.  During the course of the movie, it becomes apparent that Mr.Lemmon's behavior in supplying a tryst-house to his colleagues at work (including to Fred MacMurray), plays a major part in his advancement up the corporate food chain.  The fact that the Jack Lemmon operates a tryst-house seems highly unlikely, but it does make for a very interesting story, and it constitutes only a slight exaggeration from what sometimes happens in real life.    SHIRLEY MACLAINE.  Shirley MacLaine plays a twenty-something elevator girl who is pretty, but not particularly skilled in anything.  About half-way through the movie, we learn that she is not good at spelling words.  And we also learn that she is not skilled at choosing boyfriends.  For example, in addition to falling for the Fred MacMurray character (a married man), one of her boyfriends was sent to prison for corporate fraud.  It is not really clear what makes Ms.MacLaine attractive to men, but THE APARTMENT is a dramatic piece, and there is no requirement in dramas that everything is made logical.    SHAKESPEARIAN TWISTS.  Various things make this movie interesting.  First of all, many viewers of THE APARTMENT are likely familiar with Fred MacMurray's roles in children's Disney movies, such as ABSENT MINDED PROFESSOR and SHAGGY DOG.  What is intriguing is watching him play a contrasting role, namely, a corporate sleaze.     The film invites repeated viewings, because it contains many little clever nuances.  For example, the first time that Mr.Lemmon meets with Fred MacMurray, Mr.Lemmon has a bad cold and is administering a squirting nose solution to his nostrils.  But at the same moment that Fred MacMurray proclaims, \\"We don't want any leaks about this situation,\\" Mr.Lemmon's squirt solution accidently leaks and sends a jet of nose solution through the air.     Another very clever nuance occurs near the end of the story.  In Fred MacMurray's office, a black shoeshine man is busy shining Mr.MacMurray's shoes.  When the shine is done, Mr.MacMurray tosses a shiney coin to the shoeshine man.  The act of payment by way of tossing a coin symbolizes the fact that Mr.MacMurray, a white executive, is superior to a mere shoe-shine man.  Ordinarily, this would appear to be a reflection of the occasional overt racism that is depicted in movies before the 1960s.  But wait.  There was a distinct reason for the shoeshine episode.  What happens a minute lateris that Jack Lemmon tosses a shiney key into Fred MacMurray's hands.  This act symbolizes the fact that Jack Lemmon is morally superior to Fred MacMurray.  In the case of the coin, the shoeshine man is kneeling on the floor, and is physically located below Fred MacMurray.  In the case of the key, Mr.MacMurray is sitting in a chair, and is physically located below Jack Lemmon, who is standing.  The symbolism of the coin-tossing/key-tossing scene could not be more clear.  It was an act of script-writing genius.    What also makes the movie intersting are the many Shakespearian twists and misunderstandings.  For example, Mr.Lemmon's neighbors have been rightly convinced that it is Mr.Lemmon himself who has many girlfriends (when in fact, it is his colleagues at work who are visiting at night with their girlfriends).  Another interesting twist concerns flip-flops in keys, that is, the key to Mr.Lemmon's apartment and the key to the corporate washroom.  Throughout the entire movie, the viewer is faced with the ambiguity of whether Shirley MacLaine is going to stay with Mr.Lemmon, or whether she is going to stay with Fred MacMurray.      The intrigue and twists continue until the very last minute of THE APARTMENT.  Just to note one of the many clever features of the movie, is Mr.Lemmon's use of a tennis racket as a spaghetti strainer.  The spaghetti strainer scene is a little work of art. By the way, ther are no swear words in the entire movie, and there are no steamy scenes.  Therefore, this is an excellent movie for children.  The story provides an honest slice-of-life picture of humanity and, in my opinion, could be used to supplement Sunday school teachings in morality.  FIVE STARS.
B0038A4N3O|5.0|I have watched all season three of chuck and have to say it is the most awesome season yet-keeps getting  better and better in my opinion.  Just when I thought it may be close to running its course, they come up with the greatest story lines and clever writing.  The cast is incredible and loveable.  I did like Hannah too-not for Chuck of course-has to be ultimately Sarah.
B001RCD2DW|1.0|at the price I paid for these headphones you would assume they would be stellar set. Nothing could be further from the truth.     The left here on the set I received so much external noise move your head that you can even hear the music sometimes and when I tried to call company all I was told was to use the returned page which when I went to didn't exist. Then the nice man on the phone just hung up on me.     The sound of the headphones are really good and, when I don't move my head at all, I don't hear any of the external noise be reproduced by the headphones themselves. It sounds like someone has a rubber tire and they keep moving around in my left ear. It's horrible!    I really wish I could recommend these headphones, but I can't. Stay away unless you like your music mixed with a ton of other noise that you don't want.
0061714372|5.0|I had the great opportunity to meet Dave Mustaine in person when he signed my book in Albuq, NM. Of course I had to keep my book in the trunk of my car until I got back home after seeing him perform that evening. It was well worth the wait. The book was interesting and hilarious here and there. Some questions were made clear about his departure from Metallica but I agree with him, James should have gave him a few bucks for the trip back to Cali. Anyhow, good reading fun!

0553805371|2.0|I first come attention to this new Stephen Hawking book when both authors were interviewed by Larry King live.  Stephen Hawking's claim that the universe creation does not require intervention of God strikes my interest instantly.  But after reading the book he fell way short of giving a compelling explanation of that theory and the first 7 chapters of the book (over 80% of the book) is just explanation of modern science theories that we already know.  Sadly, after reading this book my perception of Stephen Hawking is somewhat diminished.  I used to thought that he's the most genius physicist, now I think he's a genius physicist among many who happen to crave attention.
0374158460|3.0|I found things to enjoy in this book, but perhaps not as many as some of the adoring reviewers have found.  I might be in the sweet spot of Franzen's target audience--an NPR-listening, Big 10-educated, Obama-supporting fellow with a few midwestern and generational overlaps with the novel's hero, Walter.  But by the end, I wanted Garrison Keillor's radio troupe, who were no doubt St. Paul neighbors of Walter and his wife Patty, to drop by and give them some words of wisdom from the Ketchup Advisory Board.  And maybe some trimming by Keillor's Professional Organization of English Majors would help.  Yes, Walter and company had their moments, but all in all, they, and their games of musical beds, bored me.    Not enough however to keep me from plowing through the book in three long sittings.  The theme of freedom was woven nicely throughout in a way that resonates with today's reality.  Franzen has an attention for detail that often captured me.  I especially liked his portrait of late 70's/early 80's college life, as well as some of the foibles of upper middle class urban living.  By and large, he gives an accurate portrayal of my generation and our times.  And that bothered me--mainly because on reflection I prefer the literature and mores of days gone relative to those of today.     Adoring reviewers, no doubt inspired by Franzen's \\"War and Peace\\" references scattered throughout \\"Freedom,\\" raised my hopes that we may have a new Tolstoy on our hands.  Alas, no. A few years ago, I also rushed through \\"War and Peace\\" and was dazzled.  It was an utter joy to read through its emotional highs and lows.   I was more quietly dazzled after reading \\"David Copperfield\\" this past summer.  Franzen's characters always seem to have some sort of pharmaceutical assistance to temper their extremes, and so does the novel.      So unless a friend who suggested I come up for air and read some twenty-first century fiction can come up with some better suggestions, I may well find myself regressing back to the nineteenth century for my reading pleasure, with an occasional interruption by Phillip Roth.
0545310601|5.0|Reason for Reading: Next (and final) book in the trilogy.<br /><br />There's no point giving a summary as there are already hundreds of reviews which have done that before me. Suffice it to say that there is a war and people die. One walks into this final installment knowing someone (at least) is going to die. War has been brewing during the series and it's culmination was obvious and no good writer can write realistically about war without having deaths. My own personal predictions of who would die were dead wrong and I was quite shocked with who eventually had their life(ves) taken in the name of Freedom.<br /><br />But it was truly wonderful. Everything that happened in Mockingjay felt *right* to me. It's not what I expected or how I possibly would have had things turn out but Ms. Collins went in a direction I can truly appreciate and understand. In a war who are the good guys? Obviously one would like to think the side one is on, but from an outsider's point of view can there be a good guy? and is there any real distinction between the sides, as bad guys? Each side is capable of the same thing and is it only an atrocity when *they* did it to *you*? Is it right to punish the losers after the war is over? What if you are on the losing side? How do we live with and get on with it all afterwards? Personally, I am not *anti* war, I believe that, unfortunately, there does come a time when one must fight, but regardless of a person's stance on war these are thought provoking questions that are real to any society. The ending was perfect for me. I think it was a completely plausible ending for the main characters and it felt good deep in my bones. I'm truly satisfied with how Mockingjay ended and so glad I read this series now, all together, once all the books had been published.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|The whole family loves this movie and I am sure it will be a favorite for many years in our household.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|Ben Affleck does a great job behind the camera and a good one in front of it. The movie is fast paced with great actors, Jeremy Renner as Jem, Jon Hamm as F.B.I. Agent Adam Frawley, Titus Welliver as Dino Ciampa, and Blake Lively really give great performances, but the use of Boston itself is a great supporting part of the movie, the cityscape,Fenway Park, neighborhoods and even narrow roads make the movie standout. It has twist and turns throughout and the cat and mouse game between the robbers and the F.B.I. is top notch. It is over two hours long, so sit down and enjoy it.
B003F3NDOE|4.0|**NOTE: REVIEW MAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS**<br /><br />\\"Ugly Betty\\" was a fun ride while it lasted, but it ended at the right time. Things were starting to get a little static this season, and I found myself watching more out of habit than desire.<br /><br />Despite the fact that our heroine is finally climbing the corporate ladder, the series itself seems stuck in a rut this season.<br /><br />\\"Ugly Betty\\" always impressed me with its guest casting, but this year's guest stars, such as Lynn Redgrave in her last role, and the sadly underused Judy Gold, seem wasted, their roles underwritten.<br /><br />Kristen Johnston and RuPaul both appear, looking emaciated. Kristen's part was at least bigger as she plays a former Mode receptionist of undeterminable age, who wants to get into Mark's pants.<br /><br />Some of the storylines this year were either too dull or too far-fetched.<br /><br />I didn't care for the whole Daniel-is-seduced-by-a-cult plot. The scene where Matt distracts the security guards so that the ladies can rescue Daniel looked as though they were re-enacting an episode of \\"Josie and the Pussycats\\" the cartoonish way Betty, Claire and Amanda all ascended the stairs in unison.<br /><br />The show only begins to get interesting around Episode 7 when both Betty and Hilda buy the pregnancy tests.<br /><br />Even the road trip to the Bahamas does nothing to inject some sizzle, as it's a case of too-little-too-late. The later trek to London where Betty drags Hilda and Amanda along for a bachelorette party fares much better, due to the welcome and surprise return of Christina and Gio.<br /><br />The writers keep tricking us into thinking Justin is going to confide in Mark about being in love with a boy from his acting class. The scene where they finally kiss is very well done.<br /><br />The scripts get better as the season progresses and the last four shows are highly entertaining!<br /><br />The show pays homage to \\"Dynasty\\" in a fun catfight sequence between Wilhemina and Claire.<br /><br />Which reminds me; the old warhorses of Mode both look more glamorous this season than they ever have. Vanessa Williams begins the season looking fantastic, like a 1940s movie goddess, and I swear Judith Light looks 20 years younger than she did in Season One.<br /><br />Speaking of looks, this being the final year of the series, Betty makes a gradual progression from ugly duckling to beautiful swan.<br /><br />She loses the bangs, starts dressing the part of a Mode editor, and as the final four episodes wind down, her braces come off.<br /><br />The series finale begins with a funeral. Betty must decide whether to rekindle a former relationship or move on to a new exciting endeavour.<br /><br />The show comes to a satisfying conclusion that nicely ties up the fates of its characters.<br /><br />Though Season Four wasn't as easy to get through, those who have invested four years in the show should definitely follow it through to the end. I'm glad I did and \\"Ugly Betty\\" will always be among my Top Ten shows of 2000-2009.Wilhemina and Claire.<br /><br />Which reminds me; the old warhorses of Mode both look more glamorous this season than they ever have.

There are lots of things here to help you construct the character you have in mind with greater detail and lots of things to give you ideas for new character concepts.
B000002BQK|5.0|This is a great album from Mariah Carey. The lyrics are mostly straightforward, but some are figurative. All of the songs on this album are worth the listen. \\"Honey\\" is about being in a relationship and yearning for that significant other. \\"Butterfly\\" is another love song figuratively hoping that someone will come for love. \\"My All\\" is a ballad not to be played on a sunny day but has lyrics about doing anything to see a hot person. \\"Rooftop\\" is a nostalgic slow song sampled from Mobb Deep's \\"Shook Ones.\\" \\"Fourth of July\\" is a great tune, once again, about a memory. \\"Breakdown\\" is for those who have broke up with another person and is having trouble coping relatively. One of the best songs on this masterpiece is \\"Close My Eyes\\" with its melody and soft harmony. \\"Whenever You Call\\" is about being with someone no matter where they are. \\"Butterfly (Reprise)\\" is a dancing song. \\"Beautiful Ones\\" has Sisqo from Dru Hill in it and is a remake of Prince. The last song is good. Check this album out.
0757302661|5.0|I enjoyed this book. I am a second-time Mom looking for a better birth experience than the first was, and I agree with the philosophies portrayed here. This is a good read for anyone looking for a more natural, fear-free birth experience.
B002K0WBYG|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised with this movie.  It may have been a bit predictable, but that does not change the humor presented in this movie.  Ryan is always great at his subtle sarcasm and wit.  Sandra walks and talks like an uptight city girl (no offense) and pulls it off.  Betty White is wonderful as always.  I even enjoyed the location depicted in the movie, Sitka, Alaska; very serene.  But lets also not forget the character Ramon!  The stripper scene was hilarious.  A movie does not have to have twists, turns and surprise endings for it to be enjoyable.  I laughed and had fun watching this movie and I will watch it again and again.

0545310601|3.0|I was not sure how to rate Mockingjay.  I wanted to love this book like the first two, but it fell a flat.  The story kept pace with the first two books.  I liked how the story did not end with a nice bow tied on top of it.  War is unpredictable and painful.  After finishing the book, I did not know if I liked it or not.  I had a sense while reading the first two books that Katniss was becoming more herself, stronger.  What happened to her?  The strength that I felt in the first two books faded.  It was as if all of the tribulations she had survived had not happened.  She lost her control, her strength, her resolve.  There was a glimpse of the \\"old\\" Katniss when she went to District 8 and joined the fight, but it was still restrained.    There were some scenes in the book where the reader had to make assumptions as to what the background story was.  Spoiler:  When Prim is killed, it is assumed that it was the rebels (Gale's idea) that were behind it.  Or when Katniss agreed to have another Hunger Games with the Capital's children - was she sincere or was she trying to trick Coin?  What happened after she killed Coin - that went by fast and I didn't quite understand why she was not allowed to speak on her behalf or to be a part of the tribunal.      What was up with killing everyone off - except for main characters of course?  Yes, people die in battles, especially with the traps involved in this one.  But give me a break.  There were characters that faced many obstacles and they can't survive the trip to the Capital?  They had more fight in them than was given to them in this last book.  For example: Finnick would have put up more of a fight.  His death was not one deserving of a character like him.  Through the course of the book, he developed more resolve and strength than Katniss.  If he were to die, I think his death would have been more valiant.    I wanted to love this book as much as the first two, but I didn't.  However, I was not completely disappointed.  Iliked how District 13 was not the rose colored haven that everyone initially thought it was.  I found it interesting how Peeta was conditioned to hate and want to kill Katniss.  Finnick became a better rounded character in the story.  It was interesting to see Gale's anger towards the Capital and  his skill as a hunter used for war strategies (even though he was blinded by his anger).      Maybe I will re-read the entire series and see if it changes my mind about book three.

0765326353|3.0|So, I read the first 200 pages and the last 200 pages. And then I read the intervening 600 pages and realized that I missed *absolutely nothing*. This is pretty typical for Brandon Sanderson's books. I believe he underestimates the intelligence of his readers and feels the need to repeat every single plot point ad nauseum. He needs an editor that can just say \\"NO\\". And, one that can help him distinguish the difference between internal dialog and descriptive voice.    Still, the story was interesting once you cut out all the fluff - not bad for a 400 page first novel.

B002QXI2L8|4.0|In general I agree with other reviewers on this.  More ballet than opera which is okay, as little to see in opera version, lends itself more to dance.  The choreography is quite complex, creative and flowing, and quite satisfying.  The weakness is in attempting to bring it to video.  Often, with other works, I feel that I am seeing an opera or video better at home than live, as the camera can come up close, feature movements, emotions that would be hard to see from twenty rows back in the opera house.  In this case, there are so many centers of interest going on at once at different parts of the stage that it is almost impossible to film in any meaningful way.  The film director has the choice of simply locking down the camera at the back of the house so we can see the entire stage, not missing any of the action, but also not seeing anything in close up, or attempting to go in close on some actions, but then losing others.  Often, I felt that the camera would cut away from something that I was attending to, to feature some other action of lesser interest.  Toward the end of the opera, the cameraman and director seemed to have a more consistent, artistically valid rationale for camera movement and cutting, but by then I was sufficiently irritated by wrong choices that it spoiled, at least in part, my enjoyment.  Still, awkwardness of filming aside, this is still a stunningly choreographed and performed work, well worth owning and seeing.
B002IR3PSC|4.0|This DVD is great. Althought, there are almost five songs that aren´t filmed,  it has  very good  perfomances.     And also It comes with a cd of the show with an amazing quality of the sound.
0240804236|5.0|this is the best book i've seen, if you're trying to learn how to set up and run a darkroom, without the benefit of any instruction.    still in all, you're better off signing up for some sort of classes or training before you really plunge into this; I see this book more as a supplement to this type of training than anything else.

B001TK7EBS|5.0|Amazing story of American Heroes who place their lives on the line for our freedom, which so many Americans take for granted everyday.  EVERYONE in the U.S.A. should read or listen to the audio C.D. of this story.  It gives you ensight to what our soliders on a daily basis face and enlightens and educates the reader/listener about the Middle East the territory, the ancient tribes, the villages, the Taliban. I listened to the CD version and then again with my husband because it was so powerful.  My husband was born and raised in the Piney Woods of East Texas as well, as his own father stood and fought with many brave men in the Korean and World War II and hardly ever spoke of the horrors of war, but asked himself plenty of times why he was spared while others beside him so young with so much life, honor and talent were taken.  I  believe God has a purpose and a plan for each of us and Marcus Luttrell's was to tell the story of his brothers in combat honor, bravery, courage, and love for their Country.  It's the David and Goliath story.  God will always prevail against evil, it is his plan.  Mr. Luttrell's story is a testimony, may God continue to Bless him, Morgan, his 7 minute older twin brother, his family, his fellow brothers in all the U.S.A. Military (which I salute and thank you) and this beautiful Country we call America.  Please read or listen to this book, it will for lack of a better word, blow you away!
B000001ELL|5.0|Getting this title on cd was a bit of a nostalgia binge for me...I used to own this on album as a teenager. Having gotten it again all these years later as an adult, my first re-listen to this album saw me give the album 4/5. However, listening to the cd again a few days later saw me find many of the non-hits more likeable. For that reason I bumped up the score to 5/5. Not sure what year this version of the album was released, but my cd had excellent sound quality. The guitar sound was dirty and songs were often hard rock and had riffing. Like I say, some songs were much catchier the second time around, hence the higher score.       The classics (\\"/\\"):      I was made for lovin' you - distinctive bass rhythm from Gene Simmons, a dirty rhythm guitar from Paul Stanley and my favourite drum fill from this band by...Anton Fig! I always assumed that Peter Criss drummed on this album, but I only recently found out that Criss was too problematic for the rest of the band so they used someone else...but Criss does appear in the video for this song. Ace Frehley has a good lead guitar solo here and Paul works his falsetto one time in this song. A staple of FM commercial music stations in Australia who have an element of classic rock in their format.    Sure know something - has Gene Simmons' all time great bass line. Nice note picking on the guitar for the intro. Drums are thumping. Rhythm guitar is good. Has backing vocals at times.       Not bad (\\"`\\"):       2,000 man - I didn't realise until recently that this was a cover of a Rolling Stones' song. Here it's 1970s style rock'n'roll...sort of in Suzie Quatro territory. Ace sings. Song has a good guitar solo. Bass drum, shuffling riff,backing vocals and 'out there' lyrics.    Hard times - one of those songs I liked more second time around. Initially I gave it \\"[.]\\" score. Has good, dirty riffing and interesting drumming. A bar room rocker kind of song. A dirty sounding, sing-along-able chorus.       Next best, on second listen (\\">(.)\\"):      Dirty livin' - riffing guitar, smooth backing vocals. Has two pretty bass guitar solos. In fact, the bass playing is really interesting...two styles to it: (1) jazzy and (2) funky...a la The Brothers Johnson's \\"Stomp\\"...that kind of territory.    X-ray eyes - Gene sings. Dirty riffing. Sort of catchy song, as far as the chorus goes. Gene's bass sounds phat in this song. Some nice, smooth backing vocals. Piano also features.      Then, on second listen (\\">[.]\\"):      Charisma - hard rock drum and guitar. Gene sings. The others sing backing vocals in a floaty kind of way. Good delivery to the lyrics.    Save your love - good footstomping riffing. Good tough drumming, with a good attack to them at times. Ace sings. The two factors which lift this song up are the backing vocals by the rest of the band and the riffing which accompanies them when they do that.       The rest:      Magic touch - dirty sounding riffing. 1970s style lyrics...a bit hair-metal, as far as that goes. Lyrics are by the numbers too. Paul uses falsetto once again on this album.       Recommendations:      The New York Dolls - The New York Dolls. This album came out a few years before KISS' first album, I think. Both bands have an element of 'glam rock' to them. Both also do boogie rock. This album has some terrific songs on it too. Think I gave it 75/100 here.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Why does everything have to be labeled as 'the greatest' or 'better than'?  It's art, not a competition.  You can watch the movie a hundred times and see something new each time.  The most famous aspects of the movie, of course, are the cinematographic tricks that Welles and camera man Greg Toland use:  cameras that enter through windows, doors, skylights; shots from floor level looking up at the characters;  degraded film to represent newsreels;  flashbacks, flash forwards, composition where everything in the shot is in focus and of course the famous payoff shot at the end, when we find out what 'Rosebud' represents.    I would say that this is certainly not the most entertaining movie ever made, but you have to be impressed w/ the inventiveness and incredible visual effects that this movie achieved.  Of course it's a must-see movie and probably should be watched several times.
030745455X|4.0|I very much enjoyed this second of the book trilogy by Larsson.  The protagonist continues to be intriguing and I look forward to the \\"Hornet's Nest.\\"<br />I did feel that Larsson spent long chapters exploring the plot of who committed the murders, but compressed the explanation into just three pages.<br />That being said, the book deserves the strong approval that it has received from the public.
B000Y9Q59W|4.0|It's pretty difficult to make the manipulation of stock prices interesting in a feature length movie, but Stone kind of pulls it off.  Charlie Sheen was mis-cast in the title role.  I liked Hal Holbrook's brief contributions as the worldly, elder stock broker.  Some of his lines are gems:  \\"The thing about money is that it makes you do things you don't want to do.\\"  \\"You can't get a little bit pregnant, son.\\"  \\"I don't know where you get your information from son, but I don't like it.\\"  \\"Man looks in the mirror.  There's nothing staring back at him except the abyss.  That's when man finds his character.\\"    Daryl Hannah's a good-looking blonde, but can't act her way out of a paper bag.  Martin Sheen is convincing as the left-leaning union leader and father.  Sean Young is over-the-top awful as Gordon Gekko's spoiled, phony wife.    Not a bad movie and worth seeing.
054531058X|5.0|At some point in the future the United States of America will cease to exist. In its place will be a unified North American government. That will eventually be ripped apart by rebellion which will destroy vast swaths of land and leave the people living in 13 districts.     As a reminder to the people that rebellion will never succeed, and a reminder that the Capitol has total power over its citizens, the Capitol has a game every year. The rules are simple--fight to the death.      Such is the story of Suzanne Collins' The Hunger Games. Each year two tributes are picked from each district; two children between the ages of 12-18 are randomly picked to play a gladiator style game where the last person alive is the winner. The Hunger Games is narrated by Katniss Everdeen, a 15 year old girl from district 12. Though she is a skilled hunter in the forest, she knows she will not have good odds of surviving, especially when the boy from her district, Peeta, is so much larger than she. She also knows that other districts have tributes who have trained for years to be killers.     Katniss is determined to survive, though. As she tells her story, she reveals that she is distant, emotionally cold, and very calculating. She carefully considers each and every action by how it will affect her survival. Still, she is very likeable and you will root for her survival, even though it means watching her kill other teenagers. The reader, like the characters, has to walk an intense, fine line between rooting for a winner, (while watching other children be murdered) feeling the excitement of battle, (while understanding that it is simply a tool used by the government to maintain power) and maintaining a human connection (even though it is clear that the game must be played).     Katniss is such an honest and engaging narrator that you can't help but be drawn into her world. She tells you the events in the present tense (a remarkable stylistic device) which creates the sense of urgency andspeed that will rush you along.   This book is amazing.

0439023491|5.0|This book is as good as the first. I must be careful, however, about how much I say because I don't want to give away anything about how the first book ends. Just know that as soon as my wife finished the first she jumped into the second. So did I. So did my mother-in-law. So did my mother. So will you too. Just know that it will not disappoint.<br /><br />Have I mentioned that this is a great series? It is. A pesky colleague recommended it. I hemmed, I hawed, she threatened my life, and so I read it. (Well, that's not really how it went but that's how I'm going to remember it.) As a high school reading teacher, I've read quite a bit of Young Adult literature. Some of it is enjoyable enough, but let's face it, it is written for 12-17 year olds. But The Hunger Games is a new force in the Young Adult genre. This is a book for mom, dad, and the kids. Everyone will enjoy it. (And there are no sparkling vampires-so it is a dozen times better than any other YA books on the market.)

B000EQ47HC|5.0|Boston's debut album of the same name took rock music by storm in 1976 selling, by now, heading towards 20 million copies.  2 years later Don't Look Back has sold far fewer, but, for me, it at least equals it with precise melodic guitar playing and strong vocals.  The excellent title track runs into The Journey, a slow burning and all too short instrumental.  Next up It's Easy is back to speed and then perhaps the best of all, the powerful and heartfelt A Man I'll Never Be.  Feelin' Satisfied is another good song, but I'm not so keen on Party and Don't Be Afraid.  Sandwiched in between them is Used To Bad News, a sad song well performed.  In the UK Boston albums, except Greatest Hits, are difficult to find, which considering their merits is mystifing to me.
0060730552|5.0|I've probably read and re-read Touching the Void at least 5 times now. This is an astonishing story of survival that will stay with you long afterwards. Perhaps the most remarkable thing about this story is that Simpson absolutely defends the actions of his climbing partner, although some people might think his partner \\"caused\\" his ordeal.     The book is well-written and mesmerizing. His determination to do everything humanly possible to survive (and many things that one might not believe WERE humanly possible!) is extremely inspiring.    I was fortunate enough to hear Simpson give a presentation a number of years ago, and was amazed to discover that he has a great sense of humor about the ordeals from this story as well as several other extremely frightening events in his climbing career. It might have been good to have gotten a sampling of his humor in this book, but then again, perhaps that would have been distracting.    I highly recommend this for anyone interested in adventure and a look at what the human spirit can achieve.

0618001905|3.0|This is the quintessential tale of sophisticated overlords, the flunkies of an ambitious king, reducing a hunter-gatherer population to mutilation based slavery. At almost exactly the same moment that Custer and his more astute counterparts were reducing the Native American Indian tribes to reservation servitude and desparation, European monarchs sought hegemony over the land and populations of  the last frontier available to them and it was Africa.<br /> Weapons and harsh enforcement measures enabled ruthless domination of native tribes by white men wherever gold, ivory, potash, or imaginary wealth might be found. Unlike most campaigns at the end of the 19th century, King Leopold of Belgium waged his campaign as an individual not a nation. And that makes his excesses more repulsive in retrospect. His goal was to own the totality of the African rain forest and all the riches of the lands abutting the Congo River.<br /><br />King Leopold created corporations to mimic  those with humanitarian goals. He raised money for his enterprise through the issuance of bonds, by hero ( Henry Morton Stanley) based fund raising and by suborning his government. He flim flammed his way to the equivalent of United Nations approval for taking the Congo. Then he discovered rubber, gave natives' production quotas, held hostages to ensure productivity and chopped off thousands of hands to enforce his edicts.<br /><br /> A resolute but small number of critics researched, wrote and exposed his travesties. Finally Leopold caved to pressure, sold his private property to his government and then died.  By that time 10 Million natives had died and almost every crusader against the monarch's rule of the Congo had come to ruin.<br /><br />This book follows the historical evidence of those who discovered the brutal regime and tried to bring it to a halt. It is rich in detail and ably allows one to feel the pain of the abused and the frustration of the opposition.<br />It is well written and enjoyable to read; and for me was a well researched account of a grim 30 year period when one greedy meglomaniac and his minions' methods took supreme advantage of the riches, primitive culture and vulnerability  of the Congo populations.well researched account of a grim 30 year period when one greedy meglomaniac and his minions' methods took supreme advantage of the riches, primitive culture and vulnerability  of the Congo populations.
B000025SJ8|5.0|im not gonna have an elaborate review like a lot ov other guys have done for this album... im simply gonna say that this is musically BURZUMS finest hour. you can argue filosofem for best album all around but i think this one beats it. it just had so much anger and you can really tell that with his vocals on the song WAR! not to mention ea lord ov the depths is one ov my favorite bm songs ever, right up there with mother north and under a funeral moon.. all in all if your reading this then you know what this guy and his musik is all about, just looking for the best place to start.. i would strongly suggest this as the best place to start with burzum, then filosofem right after this one. 5 out ov 5 awesome black metal!!
030758660X|2.0|I ordered two of these, one for myself and one for my friend.  While we enjoyed the book it should be noted that pages 65-80 repeat in the book.  No pages seem to be missing though.  While I think it is amusing that this occurred, others may not be so I thought I should alert buyers.
0316098337|5.0|Where to start?! This is one of the best books of the year for me. I really love Emma Donoghue's writing, but was a little afraid of Room. The subject matter seemed a little frightening and I wasn't sure I wanted to venture inside. I am soooo glad I read it.<br /><br />Room is the story of Jack and his Ma. Jack has just turned 5 when the book opens. Room is where Jack and Ma live. The world is 11' by 11' to Jack  - that's the size of the room his mother has been imprisoned in since she was kidnapped seven years ago - and where Jack was born.<br /><br />The day to day life, routines, games and learning Ma has developed to raise an imaginative, intelligent, happy little boy under seemingly overwhelming circumstances were simply amazing. The relationship between mother and child had me in tears - it was unbelievably poignant. The book is told in Jack's voice. And what a voice Donoghue has created! Jack's view of his 'world' is by turns heartbreaking, funny, frightening yet joyful and optimistic. Just think - this little boy does not realize that there is a world outside of their space. space.<br /><br />It is when Jack turns five, that Ma fears the room is getting too small and that time is running out....<br /><br />I've tried many times to put my thoughts into words for this review and have come up short every time. All I can say is it's a book you want to read. A gut wrenching, emotional, terrifying, addicting, hopeful, satisfying read that you won't be able to put down. Really.

The \\"M-Theory\\" proposed is a combination of General Relativity and Quantum Theory, and obtains such results as 10 dimensions, an infinite number of universes, and spontaneous (Godless) creation of matter under the force of gravity. Interesting in places, confusing in others, and in general not very convincing. The Feynman style jokes were a good try but not of Feynman quality.<br /><br />Three stars for the quick history of Science and superstition, and for the effort to try to explain the unexplainable. In my own view, maybe Quantum Theory is not the ultimate answer.

B002OSY2T6|5.0|I bought this for my daughter when she was 4 & 1/2 months old. She laughed when she heard the music & saw herself in the mirror the first few times I pulled it out. Then she ignored it until she was 6 months old. I just assumed I had wasted money on another toy.  Well, she loves it now. My daughter is 9 months old ..and still plays with it daily. The snail is one of her favorite toys
0767853636|5.0|This movie is a blast to watch, for adults and kids alike.  I have been looking for the widescreen version for some time, as the US release is a butchered pan-and-scan issue, which is a crime to do to a movie made with such intentionally cinematic scope.    Carol Burnett's Mrs. Hannigan is truly a marvel to watch, with an impossible combination of the gonzo, over-the-top performance that was a hallmark of her halcyon days on the Carol Burnett Show, and a genuinely likeable meanie-with-a-heart.    The other performances are universally appealing, and everyone in our family likes this version much better than the Disney retread issue with Kathy Bates & Co.  If you're old enough (as am I to \\"get\\" the humorous references historical and political references, it makes the movie that much more fun to watch.
B00005NTJK|4.0|It's funny because I hadn't listened to Jethro Tull for many years, but I was a fan in their early years. I happened on a tv concert they had on a couple of months ago and I was very impressed. I checked out some sound samples<br />from their first few albums and bought StandUp, Benefit and Aqualung. My favorite on Benefit is Cry Me a Song. This group lineup is my favorite too, and unfortunately the last album with bassist Glenn Cornick, who I thought was incredible. This was Martin Barr's second Tull album and he's still playing with Ian Anderson-that's a lot of years! If you don't have this and are a Tull fan do so.

0345472322|5.0|Dweck's book does an excellent job in highlighting the importance of maintaining a growth mindset when designing educational systems. If educators believe that intelligence is fixed then schooling becomes more of a process of sorting, labeling, and testing, rather than focusing on improving instruction so that more students can reach their full potential. The bottom line is that one test score tells us little to nothing about a student's potential.     Just as importantly, Dweck does a good job of showing the value for educators to adopt a growth mindset in relation to their own potential for becoming more effective teachers (and administrators) and for inspiring colleagues to do the same. Just as Dweck shares insights that can be valuable to educators, she also gives examples of cultivating a growth mindset to parents who are, of course, the first teachers as well as the adults youth spend the most time with throughout the first 18 years.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Brandon Sanderson has delivered another interesting book with the potential to establish a series that stands with the great fantasy works of all time.  If you haven't read any of his other works they're all must reads.  This guy isn't just the guy who filled in for Robert Jordan to get a series done. Sanderson is a for real super star. Thank you goes out to Jordan's widow for shining the spot light on such a wonderful talent. The double edged sword of losing Jordan before his time (from a fans perspective) - We got to meet Brandon Sanderson and his sudden popularity surely earned him a green light on such an ambitious project as this, but at the same time we won't see 100% of his attention to this series for another year as he finishes up A Memory of Light.
0316098337|5.0|Room is a triumph.  It is a hauntingly innocent ride skirting the dark edge of life and the nature of humanity.  I couldn't put it down.  Donoghue's writing is a brilliant cocktail: part time machine, part tabloid, part mystery, and part adventure.  Jack's innocent viewpoint and descriptions of the world around him amused and sometimes confounded me, but they were also consistently compelling and believable.  It was easy to slip into his eyes and yet, as an adult, I empathized with Ma and applauded her bravery, strength, resilience, and intelligence.  I cheered when she came up with the escape plan, and I held my breath when Jack left Room.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|These work just as well as the gamecube controllers that came with the system did when they were new.  I'm an avid smasher and brawler and they require very good controllers.  This is my choice controller.  Note that the cord is really long though.
0515142247|2.0|I'm female, so maybe this is just a guy's book.  I always like a good hero, and Jack Reacher qualifies as such, but I certainly am not interested in paragraphs-long descriptions of the geophysicalities of bullets as they traverse through the atmosphere.  This and other testosterone-laden information unfortunately comes well into the book, so I plowed through to the end.  I couldn't suspend disbelief in order to believe that any human can discern the difference between 1.4 seconds and 2.1 seconds (as it relates to the time it takes for a bullet to travel).  I believe it took me 3.7 seconds to scan through each page to a part that I could tolerate reading until the end of the book, which fell flat.
B0041ZQHHA|1.0|When I heard Brandon was coming out with a solo project I was really excited and hoping he would put out something good that wasn't the Killers.  Well, this CD sounds nothing like the Killers; which is good.  The bad part is that this CD is slow and boring.  I have tried to listen to this CD a total of 6 times and have failed to make it through an entire song without skipping to the next song.  I still haven't made it past song 6.  This CD lacks spark or any sort of momentum.      I hope that this CD doesn't mark the end of the Killers.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|Very realistic as compared to modern society.  Definitely one of the top 3 comedies of all time along with Blazing Saddles and Animal House
1416572287|5.0|[double posted in amazon.ca]    I picked this up in chapters, for $10 because the cover fell off (so much for the publisher).   I thought I was going to read a few pages, get bored and throw it out. However, instead I was very surprised by the style, insight and the clarity of the book.     I am still not sure how the author did it - but he actually made me understand the difference between the Copenhagen theory and the Many worlds theory. The idea of zero-point energy. The Heisenberg Uncertainty principle. Things I thought could not be explained without being in a class with a prof with a lot of equations on the board.     The style used in the book is refreshing. The topics are approached first with a silly question, from a dog, as to why something weird happens, and then an explanation follows. There were times in the book, when the dog asked the exact same questions I was thinking of!     I would love to see more elaborate, perhaps even with some math, works from this author.     Bravo!

It is the best group of mystery crime novels i have read in a long time!!
B002ZG997C|4.0|Though the film is based on the original script by first-time writer Gary Whitta, the mood and atmosphere of \\"The Book of Eli\\" feels more like that of a Western or a graphic novel. Some viewers may think the film's premise is similar to that of the 2009 film \\"The Road,\\" but unlike the Cormac McCarthy adaptation and its grim realism, action-packed \\"The Book of Eli\\" aims more for entertainment, but not in the same way as the \\"Mad Max\\" series did years ago. And the film's story itself requires considerable suspension of disbelief, its ending in particular.    Set in the bleak world of post-apocalyptic USA, \\"The Book of Eli\\" follows the tale of a lone man (Denzel Washington) travelling across the country, carrying a certain book. Not much is known about him - except he has been wandering for 30 years and that to protect the book, he is ready to fight and kill. And he is very good at that.     The man arrives at a town dominated by a local mobster Carnegie (Gary Oldman). Carnegie has a monopoly on the town's water that is still uncontaminated after the global disaster. He is looking for a book to consolidate his status as ruler of the community, and he is going to have it no matter what it takes.     \\"The Book of Eli\\" is directed by Albert Hughes and Allen Hughes, known for \\"From Hell,\\" adaptation of the graphic novel by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell. Their inspiration comes from many sources - Segio Leone, for instance. Eli's fighting style looks more like a swordsman's. It is fast and deadly.    With the cast including Ray Stevenson, Tom Waits, Jennifer Beals and Michael Gambon and its impressive visual sense, \\"The Book of Eli\\" succeeds in what it sets out to do, Post-Apocalyptic Western action.
0061122416|5.0|How many times have you read a book and when you are done, you go back and look for parts that you loved AND write them down AND repeat those parts to friends?  This is that book.  It's not long and it's not complicated.  It's super easy to read and speaks to EVERYONE.  The story talks about looking for clues the quest for enlightenment.  Interestingly, I see this story as one of the clues.
0802473156|5.0|I usually don't care to read, however this book is so easy to read that I actually don't mind reading it.  It's interesting and easy to understand.

0316067938|4.0|I really liked Breaking Dawn, it tied up all the loose ends and lets you know what has happened to all the characters.  I enjoyed the whole series and am glad my granddaughter bought TWIGHLIGHT for me.  It opened up another communication avenue between my grandchildren and myself.  Ms. Meyers books were easy reading and I plan to read her next book if she continues to write.
0307473473|3.0|Wow, this book was a challenge to read up to about page 330.  The first part of the book is setting you up for the pay off at the end but to get through the first part is a trudge.  I was wondering what all the raves were about.  To me the writing was just a step up from a workmanlike romance novel.  It looks like it is the same translator for all editions so it wasn't because this edition was a different translation.<br /><br />Having said this, the wrap up at the end made it all worth it.  At the end the lead character Salander turns into a female James Bond with some cool tech and character disguises and a kick ass attitude.  It took a long time in the book to really get into an appreciation of this character and the female empowerment she represents.  I love her no excuses and take no prisoner attitudes. Her message to victims seems harsh at first but is actually empowering: don't let your victimization be an excuse for bad behavior and pay back is a bitch!<br /><br />I am looking forward to the next books in the series having toughed out the set up section of book one.  Having said this I noticed reading the preview in the back of this book, it involves another scenario of a sadist with a basement.  Would be nice to have different scenarios and plot devices.  But still looking forward to learning more about Salander and seeing how her relationship develops with Blomkvist.

1433502410|5.0|This is a good bible to have I really like the commentary notes and the references. The maps and great and the information that is provided in the bible of the bible is very great. I would recommend this product over the KJV and the NKJV because it is very close to the original translation. I would rate this as probably the second best bible on the market right now. The only con is that this Bible doesn't high light Jesus Christ words in red. Overall all this is a great product.
B002VH7P4O|5.0|I bought this for one reason, the 24 bit audio of all The Beatles music.  If only this could be evidence for the death of 16 bit audio, which should be left to devices that can play 24 bit as well.  I am left wondering if technically, the down formatting from the original 24 bit to 16 bit is flawed, despite all the best efforts.  This collection is downsampled from, as I understand it, 24 bit 192 kHz to 24 bit 44 kHz, which is a lot less of a change and might be one reason for its superiority. A computer is needed to play this music for those without external media players, unless there is a way to play them from a disc.  People who aren't hearing The Beatles this way, 24 bit, are truly missing out on something.  The current fashion in remastering 16 bit audio is disappointing compared with how they could sound in 24 bit.

B000R7GKQE|4.0|SUpernatural isn't the most well-written show on TV, nor is it always the most well-acted, but there is a real pleasure to be had in this show's ability to fuse monster-of-the-week procedural stories with a deeper, reasonably compelling narrative arc. Padalecki and Ackles are solid and watchable leads, and the show deserves extra kudos for actually being filmed fairly well, impressive for what I can only imagine is a tiny budget and cgi demands. One senses the showrunner Eric Kripke has earned his keep here: the fact that there are even some genuine scares here and there only seal the deal. No awards-bait here, just good storytelling.
B000002UQJ|3.0|After the difficulties Paul seemed to have with his albums for a while in the 80s, this album seems more coherent.  There is a sense of Paul working well with a group here, and it does give an impression like a Wings album.  It does take some listening to appreciate.  It seems to denote a new flower power era of some kind hard to define.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I ordered all three books so that I could just go from one book to another without skipping a beat...Mockingjay was such a disappointment. I don't know why writers when writing series spend so much time on description.  Most of this book was disjointed.  The ending was so anti-climatic that it was over and I mean all of a sudden it was over.  War is ugly people die people rebuild...but the way she described the rebels the capital her life with Peeta and children was like reading crib notes for a test.  No substance or wait I take that back...when she did have Katniss and the rest of the characters interact it was exciting, sad, happy she made you wish for them to live she took you right there.  That indeed was wonderful...then it was abruptly over no further explanation other than to go on about something else which made me wonder if she did this to fill pages...  Nonetheless I will still recommend this trilogy but warn people not to get too excited about book 3 :(
B002ZG977Y|5.0|Great Movie! has action, adventure, who cares if it isnt true to Greek Mythos, SO WHAT! neither was the original. It was very entertaining, an action packed adventure. I dont know what the critics were looking for?? but the acting is just fine.I would never compare this to Percy Jackson, the lead actor in that movie was horrible, I think the special effects saved that movie for most people. But if you compare stories,both were very similair, both characters were sons of gods and hated their Dads.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|I really liked the premiere for another HBO high quality, well produced series titled \\"Boardwalk Empire.\\"  Steve Buscemi is a standout in his part as a corrupt city treasurer with a sweetspot.  It's gangsters and history, alright, but the personal stories and the personalities of the main characters with their families makes this series just fascinating and compelling.  I've marked it for auto record every week though it's probably available on On Demand.  I can't say this is near AMC's Mad Men or the brand new series called Rubicon (I love love love Rubicon, for me, the best) but Boardwalk ended before I thought it was halfway through.  Give it a try - along with Rubicon on AMC before Mad Men (which you should try to catch from the beginning with repeats or On Demand).
1439181780|5.0|I had only read some of Rhonda Byrne's earlier publication \\"The Secret\\", but something inspired me to buy this book and I am so glad that I did. It is a beautiful read. She shows us what life should be like for each and every one of us and she brings us back to basics as to how to achieve everything we could possibly want. I have struggled for years with money and relationships and although changing my mindset is sometimes not as easy as i would like, I am definitely feeling the benefits already.     I feel much happier and - at 32 - I now feel sure that I will have the husband and children I so long for and that I will have a beautiful home, car (Audi A3)and a life that is filled with joy. Thank you Rhonda!! Thank you \\"The Power\\"..    I hope you bring similar hope, joy and excitment to many many others!! Best of luck!
B003JSU2NU|5.0|I picked this little gem up at Target the other day because I've loved all the music in the Twilight movies. The soundtracks have really brought forth some lesser known artists and shown another side to music makers that we already love. My favorite tracks from Eclipse are 'Heavy In Your Arms' by Florence and the Machine (strong vocals yet somewhat ethereal) and 'What Part of Forever' by Cee-Lo Green (remember Gnarls Barkley?). The soundtrack is amazing and I would recommend it to those who are not fans of the series as well as the Uber-fan who buys anything with the Twilight label on it. Its great and a good addition to a smart music collection.
1579128149|5.0|It's a gorgeous, totally entertaining book, full of interesting details and beautiful pictures about all the elements.  My 12 year old son can't put it down, he's absorbed in it.
1439181780|5.0|Beautiful and very useful knowledge from Rhonda Byrne.  You can read it in few days (even in one day, it depends on the time dedicated...) and put in practice everything.  It works! If you have read 'the Secret' good, but even if you've not it's very clear tu understand.  I love it and recomend reading 'the Power' to everyone in the world.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I've always been a fairly fit person but HATE doing work-out videos. Some friends talked about this & loved it, so I tried it. I've been doing it now for probably 6 weeks or so & I absolutely love it! I've lost 8lbs & have been more motivated than ever to eat better b/c I felt like the visible results have come quickly. I'm 5'6\\" & weigh 150 lbs, so I'm not a petite, slender girl, but I love how I look now. My arms & abs are very toned (even after having 3 babies!) & my legs are thinner. I'm on Level 2 still & will move on to Level 3 when I can continuously keep up with Natalie, the one doing the advanced moves. I'm probably not moving thru the levels as quickly as is recommended, I'm not sure. I'm actually not sure what I'm going to do once I'm ready to move on after Level 3... any suggestions? I want to stick w/ Jillian b/c I know her workouts work for me. I need to visit her website, I think, to see what comes next. I HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMEND, especially for we busy mommies who don't have an hour to work out every day.
B0039SFKSW|4.0|I'm a die-hard Asia fan, even during the Payne era, so this was one album I had to buy.  Even though Asia has had a turnover of musicians during their 30+ years as a group (comparable to Yes), the music has been consistently good, just a different style depending upon who the line-up was; \\"Omega\\" is no different.<br /><br />\\"Omega' has been reviewed by many and appropriately compared to \\"Alpha.\\"  The group still boasts the big synths and backing vocals;  John Wetton's voice sounds practically the same as it did in the early 1980's; Steve Howe's technical virtuosity shines much more than it did on the previous album \\"Phoenix.\\"  The majority of the songs have very catchy melodies and great instrumental sections.  \\"Finger on the Trigger,\\" \\"Through My Veins,\\" \\"Holy War,\\" and \\"I Believe\\" are all in the \\"Don't Cry/Go\\" style.  \\"I Believe\\" is my favorite - great melody in the verse and chorus; my 5-yr-old daughter's favorite is \\"Listen, Children.\\"<br /><br />With that said, I suppose \\"Alpha\\" is a decent comparison; however, I feel that the group took part of this album in an entirely different direction.  Two songs remind me of ELO meets Al Stewart:  \\"Emily\\" and \\"I'm Still The Same.\\"  Give them a listen and see what you think.  Asia does leap back into it's progressive rock roots with \\"Now Is The Time\\" and \\"Listen, Children,\\" the latter going into a 7/4 instrumental.  There are also a couple of ballads on the album, \\"Ever Yours\\" and \\"Don't Wanna Lose You Now.\\"  The Wetton/Downes ballads off of \\"Phoenix\\" seemed lack-luster to me and I find these two are no different -  average AOR slow rock.  They aren't bad, but I don't find myself listening to them over and over.<br /><br />I think what impresses me the most is that at 60+ years of age these guys are doing what they love - and still making enjoyable music!  As a public school band and choir teacher to 13-15 yr-olds, I'm constantly reminding them that music is a hobby that they can enjoy the rest of their life, to cultivate it and practice as much as they can when they STILL HAVE THE TIME! (life, unfortunately, gets too busy to practice when you're an adult, working, and have a family)<br /><br />I'm glad I purchased the album and that these guys are still making music.  If you enjoy AOR, this will be one to add to your collection.  Give it a listen and see what you think.tice as much as they can when they STILL HAVE THE TIME!

B001UV4XWY|4.0|I expected absolutely nothing from this movie.  The trailer looked ridiculous, the plot seemed nonsensical and the reviews were all pretty nasty.  Overall, I had planned on skipping this movie altogether.  I recently found myself in a Cameron Diaz kind of mood and decided to revisit some of her films and saw that this one was playing on Cinemax.  I hesitated a brief moment before decided to just give it a go.<br /><br />I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Yes, `The Box' has a few (or more than a few) holes and it comes up short of brilliant, but much like `Donnie Darko' (another cult favorite by director Richard Kelly), `The Box' has the goods to see it through to the end.<br /><br />The story told is that of a young family in the 70's who happen to get a rare proposition.  Norma and Arthur are falling on tough times.  They are obviously in love and `happy', but they are living paycheck to paycheck and are meeting a series of devastating setbacks in their personal life.  Arthur works for NASA and Norma is a teacher.  They also have a young son.  When the film opens, it is quarter-to-six in the morning and there is a knock at the front door.  Norma discovers a box on their doorstep.  That box contains a wooden box, locked, with a button inside.  There is also a note that states a man will be visiting them at five that afternoon with further instructions.  Long story short, Norma is informed that she has twenty-four hours to decide whether or not she will push the button.  If she does she will receive one-million dollars.  Also, someone that she does not know will die.<br /><br />Now, I have a few issues with the handling of the film from that point forward, namely because the moral complexities that are thrust upon us at that moment could have taken this film ANYWHERE, and I had in mind a place I really thought it would go (especially once Arthur asks the questions \\"How well do you know me?  How well do you know Walter?\\") but instead, the film takes a slightly different course, one that involves extra-terrestrials and eventually makes its message known (the same message that kind of ruined `The Abyss' for me) and left me a tad wanting.  Yes, this film is far from perfect.<br /><br />STILL, there is a lot going on here that works rather beautifully, and the moral issues presented, while not the ones I anticipated, surely leave room for thought provoking conversation.  The idea that mankind was ruined on the whim of a woman (Adam and Eve) and that history is sure to repeat itself (Norma's decision to push the button) are subtle yet poignant POV's that really underline the context of this film.<br /><br />While I found the overall handling of Arlington Steward and his `minions' to feel rather clich&eacute;d and `scare tactic 101', I also found that it didn't take away from the film nearly as much as it could have.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised with the performances gathered together here, especially that of Cameron Diaz, who was marvelous.  I had actually heard some love thrown her way by a slew of my cinephile friends who thought the film a dud but thought her performance was Oscar worthy.  She really was outstanding here.  She not only nailed the accent work and nostalgic embodiment of the era (she felt like she belonged there), but she also layered her every move with a deep-rooted understanding of her characters current situation.  The scene where she expresses her reasons for loving Arlington, in the library, was just beautifully done, and that final scene where she pleads with her husband to `make the right choice'...it is effortlessly captured.<br /><br />She is such a great actress who fails to get the recognition she deserves!<br /><br />In the end I must say that this film has received a bad rap.  It is actually a very smart and provocative film.  Sure, it has some areas that make little sense and it needed a little tightening up here and there, but overall this film offers a lot more than most released these days.restrials and eventually makes its message known (the same message that kind of ruined `The Abyss' for me) and left me a tad wanting.

B000KUD2G4|3.0|I have a Behringer Ultra Bass amp which has a good deal of hum, which I bought this unit to eliminate. It works to a certain degree. The ground loop hum caused by mono cables was reduced by a good amount, but the buzzing caused by fluorescent lights or other environmental sources was not reduced.    In addition, a stereo cable needs to be used from the Hum Destroyer to the amp, as a mono cable will only create more ground loop hum.    I have not used other hum cancelling devices so I have nothing to compare it against. I can say the unit appears to be well made and the input/output jacks have a nice tight feel, keeping the cables securely in place.
B000000WJK|5.0|I have been sampling for months and this is absolutely one of the best albums I've stumbled across in a long time.  I have approx. 35 in Cart and over 60 in Wish List, as I keep listening/filtering.  This CD will be one of my next purchases.  It's really very good, not an average track on it.
B000TVBIYC|5.0|Duplo Trains Are Simply The Best.  If we could have only one toy, this would be it!  It's been the number one go-to toy for ages 2-6.
0316044938|1.0|This is quite possibly the worse book I've ever read.  If I could give it zero stars, I would.      The writing is amatuerish, plot started out good...but then meandered, reaching an epic fail towards the end.  The characters were very poorly developed, and overall it was sappy and melodramatic.      The whole thing seemed like a monday night movie of the week starring Cheryl Ladd or some other former \\"charlie's angel\\" as the mother.      And, I really could not warm up to the character \\"Susie\\" or her idea of \\"Heaven\\".    ~Kayla
B0000AUHQT|5.0|Excellent product in excellent condition. Packaged safely and received promptly as promised. I've enjoyed the DVD very much. Tried to purchase at a local place but was told it will not be available at all...decide to give Amazon a try and results are very satisfactory. Communication with purchasing Dept has been excellent!    Ric
0143118420|1.0|Read the movie review in the WSJ, which basically said to skip the movie, read the book, something about missing the author's talent and too much of Julia Roberts.   Eating her way through Italy was fairly fun, although ridiculously gluttonous. India and Indonesia, even her commitment to marry, drove me nuts. This woman was, and probably still is, so into herself, I couldn't believe it. Bored and too self-centered to have kids, she asks for a divorce, and then, suffocates her boyfriend. Hey, Liz, it happens all the time but most of us have had a lot more baggage we've had to deal with, in a lot less time, with a lot less money! We learn very quickly that life is made up of balances. The book's in the dumper, a waste of time. The movie? I'll wait to get it a the grocery store for buck, just to see Roberts and the privilege to Fast Forward, Stop.
B0014R34A6|5.0|Duplo Trains Are Simply The Best.  If we could have only one toy, this would be it!  It's been the number one go-to toy for ages 2-6.  If you are picking trains, go with Thomas, Percy, or Toby.  Spencer and James both have hook-up problems.  If you want a motorized train for your Duplo set, this one is the best.  We also have an older Euro-version that doesn't have auto-stop for hair tangles and it is a bit of a hazard.
B0038M2AZA|4.0|Very well acted by Claire Danes and supporting cast playing family members. I have seen documentaries about Temple Grandin and found this DVD really captured her story well, as well as being very informative about autism and the way it affected Temple's life and her view of the world. A good buy.
B0002W4SWC|4.0|\\"Bridget Jone's\\" is played by Renee Zellweger who is able to pull off a remarkable English accent.  Her touching characterization of Bridget's cheerful ways show her as vulnerable and determined to become a new person within a year.  Renee does an excellent job in this role.  I was surprised how well the accent sounded, knowing she is from Texas.  She must have been determined to succeed in this role, gaining at least 30 pounds for her character, and showing off her plump fanny in pratfalls and embarrassing situations.<br /><br />Bridget is a 32 year old spinster who has determined that her New Year's resolution is to no longer be alone.  She wants a soul mate and she is also feeling her biological clock tick.  A new red diary is used to reveal her inner thoughts, wants, loves and hates.  She does not hold back in writing anything she feels, including opinions on friends, boss, sex, food and exercise.  Her bungling and awkward ways are touching as she can't help but be open and honest with people.  Anyway, this is a year that many things happen to Bridget as she yearns to find someone who will love her just as she is.<br /><br />\\"Bridget Jone's Diary\\" has some thoughtful observations on the misery of single life, and plenty of laughs at ridiculous situations, and the ironies of many relationships.<br /><br />The movie is entertaining and perfectly cast with Renee Zellweger as Bridget, Hugh Grant (as her lecherous boss), and Colin Firth (the neighbor she grew up with), Jim Broadben t (Bridget's dad) and Gemma Jones (Bridget's mom).
B000FA57US|5.0|Halloween 4 and 5 are IMHO the last good ones in the series with solid acting and a decent story, I think despite what others say part 5 was really good although the man in black character was a little hokey but it doesnt ruin the film when dimension got ahold of the series it just seemed to go downhill from part 6 to the rob zombie crapfests spare yourself from dissapointment and keep Michael Myers in 1989 :)
B002FGU3Z4|5.0|Try on all the active sandals you want, price them locally and on line, then buy these at Amazon. They're comfortable, sturdy, and the best looking sandals around. I don't have them very long, so I can't tell you how long they'll last, but they look and feel like they'll last forever. I guess you can tell that I like them.
B0012GMUPE|5.0|Having purchased the 2008 release (here) I could not identify this as Digitally Remastered so I returned it. I would buy this just for the song Life Is Just A Game. The CD as a work stands up solid with School Days and The Dancer being additional all-time greats. Stanley's bass guitar (as lead) on 'Life Is Just A Game' is masterful with Billy Cobham and George Duke topping it off. Note that John McLaughlin plays-in Desert Song.<br /><br />The release for 12/21/2004 (MSI label, UPC: 5099750300220) is 24-bit Remastered/Reissued; Buying this CD is like having your own copy of the original master tape. Please don't believe in the illusion that vinyl is better. At 24-bit resolution (with DVD-A or DSD/SACD being even closer) only having the original master would be surpassed. Since the mid-80's, studio sessions began to be digitally recorded at the start as almost all are these days. Prior to that; any 2\\" @ 30-ips with or without ND encoded thru digital remastering can sound great if the original tape was properly cared for.<br /><br />UPDATED: To help all looking for Digital Remastered Versions, the UPC's are:'School Days' = 5099746821920 or 5099750300220; `Stanley Clarke' = 5099746821821 (1991). As for 'Journey To Love' it has been with great difficulty in that the UPC - 5099746822125 (1994) that I received (as an import) was not a digital remaster and believe it will be `hit-or-miss' on this one. The Sony UPC - 886972415024 (2008) was also not a digital remaster. Previously, I attempted to buy all three here only to return them as incorrect versions (not having the correct UPC's) as listed. These sonic comparisons were made using the `The Bass-ic Collection' CD, which is a digital remastered CD.<br /><br />Why all the fuss? These are exceptional performances by Stanley Clarke and worth the hunt or wait.
0307473473|4.0|It starts slow, but it builds into a fascinating maze of colorful characters on a collision course. Smacks of La Femme Nikita (1990), the original French movie starring Anne Parillaud, which was excellent. I can't put the book down.
B0036EH3WK|4.0|If you are a Lost fan then you MUST buy this set. It is loaded with features and hidden secrets. The visual quality of the Blu-Ray is fantastic. I had to dock it one star though because of the fact that not only is there no commentary for \\"The End\\" (which Damon and Carlton promise in another commentary track), but the commentaries themselves are not mentioned as special features on any of the disks for Season 6. I had to go online and find out which episodes had commentaries and manually select the audio track. Also, the booklet that lists the episodes doesn't mention what special features are on which disk. Would have been handy. Other than that there is a phenomenal amount of value to this set for the best show in TV history!
B00008O89K|3.0|I had the original CD version some years ago and because of moving and being in the military it went missing. I decided to get this version of the soundtrack to replace my lost one. This edition takes some liberties with the soundtrack. There are a number of songs missing on this edition that I enjoyed on the original, most notably Tree of Woe. The quality is fine, but because I have listened to and enjoyed the original soundtrack I am disappointed with this edition because they chopped some songs. Also, the first track includes the prologue-monologue from the movie, which, to me, detracts from the music. Therefore, if you want to listen to the quintessential Conan song you will have edit the first track and eliminate the monologue. Unfortunately a new copy of the original soundtrack is sold at collectible prices...
B001LF3YQK|1.0|I was so disappointed with this product, the red closure does NOT provide an airtight seal, so within a couple days all the wipes were dried out and useless.  The reviews I had read before purchasing seemed to praise it, and I was looking for a way to take just a few wipes with me vs a whole pack -- but this was a big waste of money.  DONT buy it!!
0545310601|5.0|I have loved this series from the very beginning.  I've been very emotionally invested in the characters and have been waiting (just like everyone else) to find out what would happen to Katniss, District 12, and President Snow.  Right after I finished Mockingjay I brought the book to my daughter and told her not to read it.  I told her that it was the worst, most horrible book I had ever read.  She knew I was lying of course, she could see that I had been crying and not just a few tears.  Oh no! I had the full on hiccuping sobs.  You know the kind, body shaking, snot dripping, oh yeah I was a mess for the last few chapters.  Really though I loved this book.  It was a wonderful ending, I don't think I could have asked for more.  Not that I liked everything that happened in the book, no no.  However, I knew going in that there would be heartbreak and loss, there always has been in Katniss's life.  If you haven't read The Hunger Games, Catching Fire, and Mockingjay then you are missing out on a truly amazing story.
0307454541|4.0|I enjoyed this book, although it's a bit slow at the beginning.  Actually, I really didn't think it picked up until about halfway through.  If you have the chance, see the original Swedish film - it's available on DVD and it's great.  I usually like to hear the native language and read subtitles on foreign films, but the dubbing on this was excellent, and the movie was a faithful adaptation of the book.  I can't imagine the American version could top it.
B00079FUI6|5.0|As soon as I placed my order, it was shipped out that day, and at my house within the next 2 days. Very happy with the service!!
B0001932ZA|4.0|Arnold Schwarzenegger and Richard Dawson star in this 1987 sci-fi film.  In 2019, A framed cop goes on a madman's popular tv show. I like this  film and Richard is a great villain. This special edition has nice picture   and sound plus a couple neat extras. I recommend this good 80's   sci-fi film.
B0030ZOYHC|4.0|If you've seen the first 7 episodes of the series you've seen this movie. This is almost a shot-for-shot recreation of the first few episodes of the original Evangelion series with the only interesting changes being Ramael's redesign from an eight sided die into a geometry bending monster.
1416550550|5.0|I read and enjoyed Kate Morton's first novel, \\"The House at Riverton,\\" and was interested to read her next one.  \\"The Forgotten Garden\\" far surpassed my expectations.  The journey in and out of three time periods, each with a different central character--though each connected to the others in a way that continues to be revealed until the very end--is easy to follow, and the switches add to the suspense and my reluctance to put this book down until I finished.  The weaving of the fairy tales into the main story is very effective, and there's even a little bit of Dickens (Charles and Frances Hodgsdon Burnett's both).
B0001ADAVK|4.0|Ordered it, got it in three days. DVD is fine and all is well with the world. :)
0736697640|4.0|I got it very quickly I have not got a chance to hear it yet. but it looks in good conditon, \\"Thanks\\"
B0036TGSRG|4.0|A throwback to the days when slow to boil suspense and subtle intrigue were reason enough to screen a film. The film doesn't require peeking through the fingers, seat belts or sending the kids next door to play. The `action' takes place in your mind. So often these days, we, the viewers are spoon fed everything and the direction one looks to is spelled out thoroughly, lest one be burdened with the aspect of thinking. I'd have to say the last good film of this vibe was `Match Point' (Woody Allen). What it has in common with `The Ghost Writer' besides the fact that both were directed by infamous men (here Roman Polanski) of questionable character, is that they are well done.<br /><br />The Ghost Writer concerns a writer (Ewan McGregor) hired to complete the memoirs of a former British Prime Minister (Pierce Brosnan) when the original `Ghost' suddenly dies. While researching the PM, he uncovers, stumbles upon and is led to mysterious information regarding his subject. As befits most fine mystery films, that information comes from an array of interesting characters along the way. No disappointments here, as Tom Wilkinson, Robert Pugh, and the great Eli Wallach take turns throwing curve balls.<br /><br />Kim Cattrall, as the PM's Chief of Staff communicates more with posture and a sly wink than most blabbermouths making the rounds in Hollywood these days. Olivia Williams is outstanding as his smart but strictly photo op wife. Timothy Hutton, James Belushi and Jon Bernthal spice things up along the way to make this film recommended for one of those rainy days you haven't a ghost of a chance to accomplish anything for the afternoon.
B0027BOL4G|4.0|This video tells you what is being done with the food we buy and eat. Where it comes from and the process it goes through to get to the market. You will see behind the lies and be shocked. It is a long video but has very important information. I would recommend everyone to watch this.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|It is an excellent Hayao Miyazaki film with an amazing content that makes you think a lot in what's happening to the world, it really is a great film.
B002WY65VU|3.0|The DVD seems to play well, but it sucks that it came in a black DVD case with no indication of what is inside the box.
0316098337|2.0|I was really disappointed in this book. It reminded me of watching an American actor speaking with French accent and every few words he forgets his accent. This book was the same with the boy. Sometimes he was borderline genius for his age and other times slower than his age for the same situation. Sometimes his reasoning was excellent other times he seemed almost backwards. Not to mention that when they get out of Room there is immediate acceptance by the police and hospital that they had been held all that time against their will.<br /><br />There was nothing emotional about captivity or any feelings she held against Old Nick during captivity. The premise of the book was excellent, but the  writing and story telling was sorely lacking. The characters were too inconsistent in their development.
B00405DUYO|5.0|Import Blu-Ray/Region A pressing. Hong Kong Pressing.<br /><br />I Love You Phillip Morris is the improbable but true story of a spectacularly charismatic conman's journey from small-town businessman to flamboyant white-collar criminal, who repeatedly finds himself in trouble with the law and on the lam, brilliantly escaping from the Texas prison system on four separate occasions--all in the name of love. Told with an uncanny sense of humor and a lot of heart, I Love You Phillip Morris is an oddball tale of what can happen when the legal system, a daredevil spirit and undying love collide. A lovesick prison inmate (Jim Carrey) goes to great lengths to reconnect with his old cellmate, Phillip Morris (Ewan McGregor), in this prison-breakout black comedy from first-time helmers Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, the screenwriters of Bad Santa. Leslie Mann co-stars in the Europacorp production.
B000053VAZ|4.0|&#34;Benny and Joon&#34; is a quirky movie that has heart. When Joon lost a card game she was playing with her brother's friends, before he had arrived, she won an eccentric cousin &#34;Sam&#34;. Benny is angry with his friend at first, for taking advantage of Joon by putting such stakes in the game, in his absence. But then Benny hesitantly takes this eccentric cousin in, as a housekeeper and caretaker for Joon. This movie portrays the relationship between brother and sister (and how a brother takes care of his special needs sister, even when he feels tired and insecure about his ability to properly take care of her). This movie also portrays the beautiful and strange romance that blooms between two strange people (Joon the girl with some mental problems, and Sam the eccentric man she won). Sam and Joon become a strange and quirky, yet very cute couple, who are in a way soulmates. The &#34;swinging outside Joon's window&#34; scene, is memorable and very romantic. This movie also shows the brother Benny learning to live his own life, while taking care of his sister. The only thing that annoyed me is that psychiatrist trying to put Joon in a group home and away from her only family, for no reason. In conclusion, overall this is a sweet romantic movie, that portrays both romantic love and family love, in a sincere and genuine - yet eccentric - way.
0553805371|2.0|I found the book interesting but was very disappointed to see every other page has an illustration taking up half the page and that the actual words per page are minimal given the large size print and margins used.  this \\"bbok\\" is really a long magazine article.  should be ashamed to charge full book price for something that can be read in a night
B003UYUQZW|3.0|PRINCE OF PERSIA: THE SANDS OF TIME is a Disney film based on a video game. That puts it in the same genre as THE PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN, which is a much better film.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhall (Prince Dastan) tries very hard to carry it off. A one-time street urchin, he has been adopted by the Persian Emperor and raised alongside the princes of the blood. When the expansionist Persian army comes to the holy city of Alamut, they are forbidden to lay siege to it, but the Emperor's brother Nizam (Ben Kingsley) orders the city attacked anyway, and its riches despoiled.<br /><br />Among these riches are Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton) who is the high priestess of the Alamut cult, and a dagger which has the ability to turn back time. Nizam wishes to use it for his own greedy ends. It becomes Dastan's task to stop Nizam.<br /><br />Loaded with intricate, fantastical Middle Eastern settings, a good storyline, and the action that is Jerry Bruckheimer's trademark, PRINCE OF PERSIA certainly holds the viewer's attention.<br /><br />The weakness of this film is the casting. Gyllenhaal's Dastan is credible, but lacks the wit of Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow, and is short on the action hero chops of Orlando Bloom's Will Turner. Gemma Arterton, who has an impressive resume, is very pretty as the Arabian princess, but her character's personality and behavior veer wildly between the Sixth Century BCE and the 21st Century CE; one minute she is the retiring and devout priestess, while the next minute she might be shouting, \\"Let's go Mets!\\" and spilling beer on herself at a ballgame.  Ben Kingsley isn't at all convincing as the evil Nizam, who starts out as the Princes' kindly Uncle. He seems to want to stay in that groove.<br /><br />Still, this is a good film to share with the family.
B0038P9LTU|5.0|This album is great! Rhapsody Of Fire is one of those bands that you can buy its albums with your eyes (ears) closed!
B000F9RB9Y|4.0|The film? It's brilliant. But if you were considering buying this you'd know that already, so I'll be talking about the product here.    One problem with the release of older films on higher definition formats is that the picture quality does not do the extra definition justice. This may be the fault of a poor transfer or decay in the film stock itself, but whatever the cause really is, such lesser image quality is common in films up to and including those released in the Eighties - which is not very long ago at all.    Fortunately the picture on this 1985 movie is almost up to the razor-sharpness of a 1990s or 2000s film, quite enough to give you that extra enjoyability of the film experience that HD is all about. Sound is good as well, and you don't have to crank your volume to stupid levels - another common Blu-Ray fail. Extras are limited to deleted scenes and a 'retrospective', but who cares about having masses of surplus extras? Cameron's never been one for director's commentaries anyway, so you'd hardly expect to find one here.    Well recommended, then, and fingers crossed for 'Aliens' and 'The Abyss' when they come out.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|I enjoyed Ark of truth.  It did tie up some of the loose ends with the Ori.  I did feel the fight was a little long (sorry Bam Bam).  It made me want to see more seasons of the series.  Love the interaction between Vala and Adria (typical mother, daughter moment almost).
B001EO748M|5.0|This series was so fascinating that my wife and I actually started looking at  the Encyclopedia Britannica and other reference materials to research the characters  even deeper. Great series!
B002PMV9K6|4.0|I thought it stayed pretty close to book.  I would have liked to see the Dumbladore/Dursley meeting rather than distruction from the bad side of the wizarding world.  Since the Dursley's have been a part of the books as well as the movies since the beginning it would have been nice to see them getting put in their place and learn of Harry's new home ownership.
B000P12LWY|5.0|Although it has too much gratuitous sex, the Tudors in fascinating to watch  and truly absorbing. The actor portraying Henry is fantastic and all of the   other characters are truly gifted and dynamic. My wife and I couldn't wait for   our Season Two.
B003XWEQ1G|5.0|First of all, this interpretation of the Robin Hood story is probably the most realistic one ever done as well as one of the best acted.  No \\"wink wink nod nod\\" scenes, no shrill \\"didn't we tape your mouth shut in the Abyss\\" Maid Marion and no Americanized English for Robin.  This was Robin Hood for \\"grown ups\\" and unabashedly so.  Ridley Scott deserves praise for this movie.    As to the reviewers who rated the movie much lower than I'd have imagined it deserved, I understand that everyone has an opinion and art is in the eye of the beholder.  However, I am shocked that some of the comments are so vile concerning the screenplay and the actors.  If you came into this expecting \\"Gladiator,\\" or you wanted graphic sex scenes or were hoping that you'd understand the story more because you're used to the Kevin Costner or Errol Flynn \\"Robin Hood,\\" then I understand your low ratings.  This movie was an attempt to combine the history of the times (with some liberal skewing between the centuries in some cases) with quality acting (understated in some cases but always top notch) and pacing that fit the story vs. the ADHD that audiences tend to have these days, victims of CGI and MTV styled battles.    If you like good storytelling, you will enjoy Ridley Scott's \\"Robin Hood.\\"  If you don't, that's ok - Amazon has all of the prior \\"Robin Hood\\" stories in both regular and Blue-Ray DVD, VHS and of course you can read the print versions as well.
0765326353|5.0|I just finished this book tonight!  This  was really an engrossing book, and once it takes off, it really takes off!  As usual, Brandon does a great job at creating a unique and vivid world in which to tell his story and he has this wonderful knack for hiding secrets in plain site.  I'm constantly going back through the book, worried that I've missed some vital clue to the story.    Something I thought was really telling is that as I finished each POV chapter, I was always sad to leave that POV and temporarily leave that part of the story, but then I page into the next chapter (and next POV) I would already be fully enveloped into that character's story, and not want to move back to the other once I finished that chapter!  A never ending cycle.  Even after 1000 pages, I did not want the book to end, especially with how many new questions come up in those final chapters.  I eagerly await the next in the series!
B00095NX9G|5.0|This dvd is so full of technique, drill, classes, choreography, and yoga, that it seems impossible to me that it should be sold for so little.   I think my favorite thing about Serpentine is that (other than that it's Rachel Brice teaching it) it's designed to be able to be used in many ways. If you have time every day (or even once or twice a week) you could get through the whole 200 and something minutes of it, but since it isn't likely that you have that kind of time, it's been set up so that you can set up a weekly routine (such as mine where I will, every day, do the yoga warm up, and some days do the Leg Strengthening Drills, and other days I will do the Isolation Drills) and build on it each week or so.    On the downside, I find myself often having to pause because Rachel just breezes through things and I (being only a year or so into belly dance) have a hard time keeping up. I often rewind so that I can watch and re-watch how she's moving. She does give good direction, but often the technique or drill in question isn't repeated enough to hammer it home in my head.    Otherwise, I love it. I think I'll be dancing with it everyday. I won't give a long review here on everything this contains, since others have already done so, but I will say it is worth it. World Dance New York really know what they are doing.
0843189673|5.0|This was a gift for my son's third birthday, and turned out to be his favorite set of books all year. Beautifully packaged, the stories are cute and fun to read for both kids and parents. Bought a number of these as gifts for friends.

B002ZG980U|5.0|I just finished seeing this movie, and I absolutely enjoyed it. The concept was what I loved the most.  Yes, the picture had its share of special effects and CGI, but the reasons for them were always clear, and they served the plot so very well. The multi-layers of action going on were the driving force behind the picture and kept it going. So, if that kind of story doesn't interest you then Inception is not your kind of picture. But if you like movies that explore the mind, dreams, and the different levels of consciousness, you will enjoy this movie.  For me, the special effects were just a really cool way to show what was happening in the mind as opposed to the use of some abstract, slow, surreal, lifeless way of showing this. The acting was well done by all the players, and there were times when the tension was almost unbearable. Thanks, Christopher Nolan, for a great adventure.
B002ZG98UA|4.0|if you are a fan of the other three movies in the series, then you will certainly enjoy this installment.  I just watched it last night on the big-screen.  The 3-D effects were very impressive and well done.  Don't wait for home video dvd- watch it on the big screen for the ultimate viewing.  Plenty of action, plenty of zombies, plenty of ass-kicking scenes.<br /><br />And hey, the beautiful, talented, and awesome Milla Jovovich is in it.  That should make you happy.  The end of the film leaves room for another sequel, so be ready for one coming in the near future.  I'll be the first one in line at the box office.<br /><br />* recommended viewing *
B00005OWEG|3.0|After viewing the original when it was released in 1979, I had been back from the war for twelve years. Stationed at DaNang Air Base as a munitions specalist, my colleagues and I were in danger, but not the kind of imminent danger shared by the M-16-toting Army and Marine Corps soldiers. The surrealistic, psychotic head-space portrayed in Apocalypse I and Redux was unknown to us. We just screwed bombs and rockets together for F-4's 70 hours a week and went back to our barracks for a beer.  Viewing Apocalypse Redux was nearly a psychedelic experience for me now (2010). Although obviously written to show the madness of war, I see it as so over-the-top as to be almost meaningless except as three hours of bizarre existentialist angst, a bad LSD trip, or an ueber-intellectual/showoff mind game by the producer. It's the complete answer to a question that is never defined. If I ever figure out what Coppola had in mind for its desired effect on the audience, I'll repost. I was, however, in awe of Martin Sheen's role, as I was with his son, Charlie's, in \\"Platoon,\\" a much simpler tale.  I actually met troops such as those portrayed in \\"Platoon,\\" but the politico-psycho nutcakes in Apocalypse are just apparitions to me.

0451191153|5.0|When I bought the Fountainhead several years ago I did not realize the large impact that the novel would have on my life. There are very few books that I have read (currently read several hundred), and believe the book is the only book written in the epic/romantistic style in the last hundred years that is a must read (excluding atlas shrugged). The novel is split into three sections and can sometimes drag on, however, I have found that the feeling of dragging only occurs to those who do not truly wish to read the novel. As stated it is written in a romantic style, and is a love story of sorts explaining Ayn Rands philosophy in an entertaining artful form. I feel that every person should be at least invited to read such a well written and interesting book. Highly recommended

1848876599|5.0|Playing The Enemy aka (Invictus) written by John Carlin, depicts how Mandela used rugby to unite a divided country. Many Black South Africans saw rugby as the White South Africans' second religion. White South Africans lived and breathed rugby. It was their \\"opium.\\" To snatch their rugby world from beneath the feet they used to cripple, trample, and oppress the nonwhite citizens of South Africa would be a devastating yet effective blow to the White man's ego. Under the leadership of Arnold Stofile, that is exactly what the anti-apartheid group, the African National Congress (ANC), accomplished. In 1985, the ANC managed to stop the South African Springbok's tour of New Zealand. The ANC also led an international boycott that banned South Africa from participating in the 1987 and 1989 Rugby World Cup, because of the harsh treatments of nonwhite citizens under the cruel system of apartheid. Again, they succeeded. This infuriated the South African government and supporters of rugby. The government retaliated and staged enormous disturbances, chaos, and attacks throughout black townships.    As the international climate continued to change, more countries showed public outraged criticizing South Africa's apartheid system of government. Many called for the release of Nelson Mandela. Because of internal and external pressures, South Africa's government had to act. They faced two options. They could either go to war or negotiate a system of power with their oppressed citizens. They chose to negotiate.    The atmosphere was thick with fear and anxiety. Most White South Africans feared a majority rule government. They feared the unknown. They feared losing their statuses. That fear led some White South Africans to take up arms, join White supremacy groups, and revolt against the government if necessary. They had been taught from birth that their skin color made them superior over the other races. Black South Africans feared the prospect of Whites resistance to change. They feared supporting a team like the Springbok.    Although a political prisoner at the time, Mandela convinced the South African government to meet with him to discuss necessary and inevitable changes in the structure of the South African government. However, before these clandestine meetings occurred, Mandela spent years learning about his adversaries. He learned their language and history. He understood how they operated. He grasped the need for South Africa to move forward in peace and unity as one country. He decided to make an appeal to his enemies' hearts and not to their minds. This technique proved beneficial for Mandela as a prisoner and later as president. That is why rugby became the necessary channel for change. To encourage harmony in South Africa, Mandela and the ANC lifted the ban on South Africa's rugby team and allowed them to participate in the international games and world cup events. With fingers crossed, Mandela and the ANC hoped this move would not only lift the spirits of their White citizens but show them that the new government was reaching out to them. They also hoped that Black South Africa, who once saw the Springbok as a symbol of apartheid, will now see the Springbok as their team too.
B0035V35P8|3.0|I had high high hopes for this movie, because unfortunately, at least in American cinema, the pure ninja/martial arts movie is a thing of the past.  But, this movie is hamstrung by several factors:    1.  Poor script/plot.  Pretty much every old ninja/martial arts cliche is brought back to life.  There are the requisite training scenes, the blood feud between the ninja and his old clan, etc.  In some ways, it reminded me of the movie Hunted, with Christopher Lambert.  I was hoping for a reinvention of the ninja genre that would breathe new life into it - this movie was far from it.    2.  Poor special effects.  There seems to be a tendancy to use CGI for complex action sequences and blood splatter effects.  The problem with this is that it is really, really hard to make realistic blood splatter with CGI... most of the time it just looks like cartoon blood.  In addition, CGI generated weapons also have a habit of looking cartoony.  Part of the greatness of old martial arts movies was the fact that the actors really were doing what you saw on the screen... an element sorely missed in many scenes of this movie.    Without a solid or interesting plot, this movie really needed strong visuals and amazing action sequences to hold the viewer's interest.  Unfrotunately, this movie fell short.

0674049160|5.0|I was so happily surprised when I received this book--much nicer than expected! It is small coffee table-sized, is printed on nice, thick paper, and has a lovely mustard cloth cover under the dust jacket. When you open it, the layout of the pages make the book lovely to look at and read. In one column are the annotations: notes about the text, the history of the time, and etc. Throughout the book are illustrations of period art, beautiful to look at. This edition is a wonderful collector's piece and you get so much more than the story (I would have been happy with just the story and illustrations, too!). Janeites and others, don't miss this book.

Sam Roth wants to come closer to the house but his instincts tell him not to. Images of his human life flash though his wolf brain. Grace steps outside spotting her wolf. She kneels in the snow and holds out her hand, waiting for him to come to her. Sam inhales the air picking up Grace's scent--sugary cookies. What harm would it cause to go to her this one time? Sam lifts his paw from the icy snow . . .<br /><br />Set in Mercy Falls, Minnesota, Stiefvater's story hooks the reader by the first sentence, by the first paragraph. What follows is a well-written novel from uninterrupted subplot to plot in an even flow to the end. The characters are well-drawn. The reader cares about the primary characters. This invests the reader in the storyline. The description, dialogue and setting all set the conflict, which in turn set the atmosphere and tone of the story. Stiefvater's book is a page-turner until the very end.<br /><br />Stiefvater's novel will appeal to Young Adult readers who enjoy the Twilight series by Stephenie Meyer; especially those not in Edward's camp. This well-written novel has won two awards (British Fantasy Award (2010) and ALA/YALSA Quick Pick for Reluctant Young Adult Readers (2010)) as well as numerous Young Adult and Teen nominations.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Spartacus, one of the best series on TV at the present time!! I didn't like 300 all that much, I feel that Spartacus is a much better portrail, however some have seem to have forgotten that 300 is about the Greeks and not the Romans. I don't know if anyone has also recognize the fact that there are at least three actors from Spartacus that played in 30 days of night! Manu Bennett played Billy and there are at least two of the gladiators that played vampires. I am a little sad that they killed off some of the main characters in the first season, like Lucy Lawless & John Hannah! I am going to miss them very much, however I am glad that the slimy weasel Asher got away! Look forward to seeing what he will be up to in the shows to come!! Can't wait for season II and whats in store for Spartacus and the gladiators that freed themselves. Can't wait!!!! The best show ever!!

0545123283|2.0|Linger is the sequel to Shiver. It is necessary read it first to understand the strength of Grace and Sam's connection and to understand her relationship with her parents.<br /><br />I gave Shiver 5 stars. I am so disappointed with this one. Shiver ended on such hope that I immediately knew that I would buy the sequel. I also had questions of what had happened to Sam at the end. Other than a brief paragraph where Sam recalls being ill, this is never answered.<br /><br />The author enters too many people's heads. The story is told in first person from the point of view of four characters. Two is enough. Cole and Isabel just aren't likable. They both turn out to be good friends in the end, but mostly it's irritating spending so much time in the heads of two whiney rich kids with no manners. I never could figure out what was so horrible about Cole's life. His father believing in him? Or is that going to be in the 3rd book? They take away from time spent with Sam and Grace. Rachel, one of the funniest and best things going for this book, is not in here nearly enough.<br /><br />I was going to give this 3 stars until the ending which was an obvious ploy at getting you to buy the third book in the series. If I was promised the third would be the last, I would buy it, because I love Grace and Sam. As it is, I'll wait until the series is finished and check it out at the library.
B0006N2EZ0|4.0|Finally got around to watching this.    Would have been perfect without all the s*** and f*** words.  Great story and very romantic.  The scene with Whitney belting out \\"I will always love you\\" almost brought me to tears.  Brings back some wonderful memories of great songs.

030726999X|4.0|I thought it was meant to be the last book of Larsson's trilogy until I read in Paris-Match that there were other books planned, that the Salander-Bloomkvist saga was supposed to be a series.  This makes sense when you read the rather open ending.<br /> I agree with reviewer E. Jacob that this novel is not the best of the trio, at least not in the beginning, and that it is in need of more vigorous editing.  It takes forever to start.  The motor roars with no vehicle really moving for the first hundred pages or so.  And then, vroom!  It's police, personal, political all at once.  It's the \\"24h du Mans\\" of intrigues, one racing against the other, crashing on occasion.  There is an orgy of characters, many of them corrupt or fascist, or crazy.  There are the police forces doing what they can, and the government, typically hesitant before deciding to get involved.  There are the ambiguous secret services.  There is a judiciary system that convicts, but not necessarily out of principle or convinction.  There are the heroic journalists, of course.  We know that Larsson was one of them and that he was a man of courage fighting extremists and Nazi organizations. And we realize that Larsson the author has the ambition of underlying here the ills of society, including the wrongs still done to women in countries as progressive as Sweden.  So kudos to the undertaking.<br /> Frankly, things pick up when Salander gets out of the hospital.  She has been seriously wounded in The Girl Who Played With Fire as she tried to settle matters with her murderous father and brother.  The fact that despite this her father is staying only two doors away from her at the hospital is one of the weaknesses of the novels.  I realize Larsson wants tension to continue as Daddy wants his little girl dead, but since I go through no suspension of disbelief here, it doesn't work for me.<br /> But as soon as Salander works on her defense and teams up, albeit electronically, with Bloomvist, the story becomes alive again and the book, a joy to read.  Nothing is missing: action, suspense, court scenes, and the bittersweet, and stubbornly anti-romantic attitude of the main characters.  So anti-romantic in fact that it may be a shield against what they fear more still than all the blows they have already received.  For love can be a hell of a bang on the head.gain and the book, a joy to read.

B000F7CMQ8|3.0|.....Gable had been playing this type role for so long that had become a caricture of himself.  He was far too old to be believable as a love interest for two women young enough to be his daughters.    .....The electricity between Gable and Harlow was not there with Gardener, who played her typical MGM glamor girl role and was a far cry from her excellent performance in \\"On the Beach\\"    .....If the movie was meant as a vehicle to introduce the cool beauty of Grace Kelly to American audiences then it was a sucess but Kelly's acting ability suffered in comparison to Mary Astor.  Astor gave a dynamite performance in \\"Red Dust\\".  Kelly was better suited to movies like \\"To Catch a Thief with Cary Grant.    .....The color and action scenes were good and I guess that Ford can take credit for that but this was far from his best effort.    .....Compared to the original \\"Red Dust\\" on a scale of one to ten with \\"Red Dust being a ten ...I give this movie a three.  If you throw out the acting performances of Gable. Gardener and Kelly and just judge the photography and color then I would give it a six.
0143118420|2.0|Eat in Italy, pray in India, love in Bali (Indonesia).  It's a charming traveling journal, but a spiritual journey it is not.  Italy is the tastiest and most personal.  The rest is light, prose included, and appears to be over the author's head.  She seems more like a little girl experimenting the taste of various cakes than a fully grown woman trying to find meaning in her life.  To do the latter, a travel of the mind needs no plane or new country, but maybe eyes, a heart, and involvement in causes beneficial to forces outside one's own belly-button.

What bothers us more than anything else is that every time we start the DVD, you are forced to watch all the trailers and ads before you begin the exercises.  Therefore, we have to turn the DVD on and wait about 5 minutes for all the ads to play through EVERY TIME!!  If they made the DVD so that you can skip straight to the exercises, I would have given this a 5 star rating.

Basically, Amazon over-delivered. Thanks.

I personally believe that among professionals that today hold that view, it was this disk that made it impossible to ever believe anything else.

B001C4CI8U|5.0|FRINGE season one takes a massive stab at everything that makes TV intriguing and exciting.  Somehow, the writers of the show have addressed absurd pseudo-science ideas and made them reasonably believable.  The odd and sometimes disturbing ideas that the show puts forward are extremely entertaining and fresh.  I have had no problem suspending my disbelief for the journey FRINGE takes me on.  However, it is not the content of the show that makes it.  It is the acting and the rich dialogue between characters that make me want to come back each time.  Certainly there are stereotypes: The mad scientist, the pretty but tough female cop, the good looking rogue with a heart of gold.  However, the characters come alive on the screen and are portrayed with such adept skill that they are a joy to watch.  FRINGE deals with issues that go \\"bump\\" in the night and serve to make us wonder if there are strange things in our world that we are unaware of.  Rich characters take us on the trip, and it is worth the ride.

1932100660|5.0|Very interesting, but a little scary at the same time.  The authors walk through a number of research results that connect diet with disease.  Protection of the status quo by the stakeholders in our government and the food industry is eye opening!  We are deluged with conflicting information regarding what is healthy and this book helps to put things in perspective and makes sense out of some of the madness.  The unequivocal message throughout the book is the value of a \\"whole foods, plant based diet\\" to combat and prevent disease.  I was expecting more information regarding the actual study that was conducted in China, but that portion of the book is limited to one chapter.   Overall, a great read that will make you think about what you're eating and how the latest diet or supplement fad is just that -- another passing attempt to gain health without a committment to eating well.

Ending such an amazing series this way is not going to please everyone. I understand and can fully appreciate the emotional and physical reactions the characters have.  Sometimes it seems so dark, but how would you react in the face of these challenges and losses?  I loved it. I can't wait to see how the movies turn out.

1579126278|4.0|Although I appreciate the groundbreaking nature of its famous twist ending, it was pretty obvious to me from pretty early on (and I'm not a particularly perceptive or clever mystery reader).  I still greatly enjoyed this Poirot outing however and found it a crisper, less convoluted and faster moving read than others in the series.  It was refreshing to have the great detective interpreted by someone other than that self-absorbed, semi-lovable imbecile Hastings even if the good doctor was pretty much cut from the same (houndstooth tweed) cloth.  Interesting to see the genesis of the Marple character in the doctor's sister (who steals the show) and in that sense, this is  a truly seminal Christie novel.  Dame Agatha was a pretty witty gal and the mahjong sequence was a great delight.<br /><br />All in all, a very enjoyable whodunit and well worth a read.  A lot of issues and story lines are left unresolved  at the end, but I suppose they all sort themselves out somehow and, since the killer has been exposed and the murder solved, we and Poirot are outta here.  I read the Kindle version (what a bargain) and couldn't put my iPhone down, but I'm a sucker for old-school english drawing room murder mysteries.  I'm definitely going to recommend it to my butler unless the colonel has already put him on to it, the old blighter.  Good show.
B002VPE1XE|4.0|Small cameras can certainly go inside the case, but the case doesn't necessarily fit small cameras.  I have several digital cameras and the case is too big for all of them.  It measures approximately 3\\" (7 cm) in width and 5 1/2\\" (13.5 cm) length, when fully expanded. It has enough room for two cameras, and that's what I've put in it.  I've put my Fuji EXR and Flip video cameras inside of it together.  They may rub a bit against each other, but at least I can now carry them both in one case and not have to bother with separate cases.<br /><br />The padding is not very thick.  It's thick enough to protect what's inside against some minor bumps and bangs but it probably won't help to protect very much if the case is dropped from a few feet onto a hard surface.  The zipper pouch is nice to put in extras like video cards, batteries, etc...and it zips up nice and tight.  It has a very strong velcro front flap fastener which I doubt will come open on it's own.  The belt attachment velcro is also very durable and strong.  The wrist band is nice too but it would have been a nice touch if a belt loop clip and been included.  I don't always wear a belt and it would be nice to just hang the case from a belt loop.<br /><br />Overall a nice case, just larger than advertised.  So if you have a larger camera then it should fit nicely.
B0010DGYJW|5.0|This is a re-release of the 1999 album from W.A.S.P. I've always been a fan of Blackie Lawless but he outdid himself with this album. It is without a doubt his best work after The Headless Children. This album tells the story (semi-autobiographically) of a kid who want to be a rock star, no matter the cost. He's a disappointment to his father and gets dragged through the dark side of the music business, drugs, groupies, and sycophants.     Highlights are Arena Of Pleasure, I Am One, The Idol, and the acoustic classic Hold On To My Heart. Blackies' version of the Led Zep classic When The Levee Breaks on disc 2 is worth a good listen too.    Musically, this album is top notch. The riffs are great with plenty of hooks to keep you banging your head, and Bobby Benalli's pounding double bass drums are phenomenal. Blackies' lyrics are introspective and way above anything he's written up to this point in his career.

0307474712|2.0|After their post-graduation hook-up, Dexter and Emma stay in touch for some reason, despite his being a self-absorbed rich ass. Emma's relatable enough of a character: she's your friend who has crap taste in men who never gets over the loser she for some reason loves. It's rather sad that she never meets anyone better throughout her life.     Still, the book moves along quickly, what with dealing with the main characters for one day (St Swithin's) out of the year. The ending, however, (I'm not giving anything away here) made me feel like the easy-moving gliding pace of the book was rather like an elevator ride with the main characters, and then they farted just before they got off, leaving me standing there thinking, \\"What the...?\\" Did the publisher start strong-arming David Nicholls for the finished book, and he quickly dashed off the resolution? I would have been less annoyed if on the final St Swithins Day they just went out an adopted a pet unicorn together. Abrupt shift!
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I read all the reviews over a few sites and such before I purchased because of the price but when it came down to it, it was well worth it. The sounds you can hear now, even when I have surround sound speakers, putting that surround sound in head phones makes you feel like you're in the game.  There is some popping I do notice, seems like between certain loading screens and such but its not like it pops when shooting off a gun in an FPS.  Overall, very awesome product, just wish price was cheaper :)
B0033AGPF8|5.0|Hello.   I bought this Vinyl edition of Axis:Bold As Love  and AYE and EL 2010 Sony editions, got them a couple of weeks ago and tonight  just opening them to give em a play and the outcome is mixed but this is NOT to imply that   Amazon is the cause of this, so without further ado.....  Axis: First thing right off the bat, side one is pressed OFF CENTER! Like by 1/8\\"!! Not a little, not a smidgin,   but literally I'm watching the needle/tone arm moving oh so gently back and forth.....not good people for an  AUDIOPHILE PRESSING!!! I can hear the 'wobble' if that's what you want to call it.   Before we go into the sound of this I also want to say that my copy of ARE and EL  all three are affected by side one being pressed OFF CENTER. Side two of Axis and ARE are good, but it is   disconcerting that all three copies I received have the same defect. And Axis's side one label is even off big  time!! Not a good thing again for an Audiophile pressing-I will be returning them for replacements and will  let you all know how that turned out.....now for the Audio on Axis, which is the one I listened to all the way  through.........WOW!!!  I DON'T know how to say it properly. The audible difference in listening to the compact disc  issues, doesn't matter which one really, to this particular Re-Issue, is beyond words. Headphones do it justice and  over the speakers it's so totally different, but just to say, it IS true, this Analog Vinyl issue just sounds so right, and   it makes the cd issue harsh and totally fake. Janie at Experience Hendrix did it right on these. But...... you still have  the drawbacks of vinyl to deal with, limited high end 'level' as compared to the cd and an overall laidback presentation  compared to the compact discs 'in your face with loudness' sound. So, where do I go from here?? Well I honestly don't   know. But this Vinyl edition, sonic wise, is very very Natural sounding and leaves the cd issue in the dust.   More Later as this progresses.

030745455X|5.0|I had read reviews that the first book (The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo) was a little better than this one, so I was a little apprehensive to buy it, but I was so happy to find that I loved this book even better than the first one!  Dragon Tattoo started out a little slow for me, although it picked up and I ended up loving it, but this one had me hooked from the beginning.  We get to know Lisbeth even better and we learn many of her deepest secrets.  She's a great character... the badass outcast supergirl.  The book ends just after the climax and before the resolution, so you will want to buy the third book (The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest) so you have it on hand to start reading right when you finish this one, as it picks up where this one leaves off.
0385341008|5.0|A really nice book written in letter style.  It tells a wonderful story through the voices of many charcters.  I loved it.  It is informative about the Nazi occuptation and the effect on the Guernseys Island before and after.  You begin to love the charcters.
030726999X|5.0|Highly recommend this book.  It is longer then the first 2, but ties up alot of loose ends and questions especially regarding Salander's life.  Really enjoyed it.
030745455X|5.0|I loved all 3 books in the series and couldn't put them down.  A must read! Would highly recommend.  The lead charcter is so interesting!
0060229357|5.0|This is an excellent book for reading to your toddler (or older!) at bedtime.  It is a soothing and interesting adventure that gives the child a sense of control over his destiny.  I attribute my kids' early reading skills to the way they could follow along with the story while cuddled up next to me; soon, they were reading the book to their stuffed animals!  There are several other Harold books by Crockett Johnson, and all are excellent.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|This is a great movie to watch especially after you've watched Jane Austine's Pride and Prejudice.  I loved the characters in this movie and will definatly watch it over and over.

0375842209|5.0|When a writer truly loves a story...    When a writer truly loves his characters...    When a writer truly loves words...    ...It shows.  And in Markus Zusak's \\"The Book Thief,\\" his love leaks through the words and warms the reader.  These well crafted characters will burrow into your heart and stay there as long as you allow them, which makes this book all the more wonderful.  All the more rewarding.  All the more devastating.  It's a thick book, one that you can live in for days.  There are no surprise twists, no cheap plot devices.  It's just very obviously a labor of love, made up of tears, sweat, and staggering creativity made physical.  Everything about it avoids what's conventional, from its take on the narrator (small spoiler, which you probably already know: it's Death), to the way the story is told (telling the end first, disregarding tension in favor of character development), to the pieces of other books included within.    It's the best book about the beauty and danger of words that I've ever read.  It's about a book thief who discovers words later than other children her age, but learns to embrace and use them better than she believed possible.  It's about a Führer who has the same power over words, who uses them to destroy and spread hate.  It's about how the book thief lives and learns to love in the world that the Führer, the other \\"word shaker,\\" has created (or, rather, destroyed).  It's brilliant, beautiful, and... well, a damn classic.    As a writer who loves his characters and story and words as much as Zusak, I can only hope that I am able to express my love as well as he did.  \\"I have hated the words and I have loved them, and I hope I have made them right.\\"

I loved how the kid tried to become a first hero and totally epic failed his first time.  It was so horrible.  Heh.  There's a good mix of humor, tension and action in this picture.  Hit-Girl, the 11 year old, takes everything to a new level.  Based on a comic book series.  WHEN WATCHED: 09/18/2010; MY GRADE: A minus to A (non comic book fans will give it lower).
B00005JNQS|4.0|From the beginning, the computer-animated feature film genre has been a back and forth battle between Pixar and DreamWorks and then a new contender arrived seemingly overnight to offer legitimate competition in the form of the Ice Age series (which is now a trilogy with a spin off called Rio nearly complete).  The company, of course, is Blue Sky and with distribution being handled by 20th Century Fox, the studio has had an impressive run of CG hits including the Dr. Seuss classic Horton Hears a Who.  Robots snuck into the mix back in 2005 with a cast that was impressive even for a big budget CG feature!<br /><br />The story follows Rodney Copperbottom, voiced by Ewan McGregor, a small town robotic inventor with aspirations of moving beyond his quaint surroundings.<br /><br />Rodney embarks on a journey to Robot City to meet his idol, the majestic inventor Bigweld, voiced by none other than Mel Brooks.<br /><br />Once in the big city, Rodney discovers that things aren't at all like they seemed on television. Before long he hooks up with the Rusties, a ragtag group of street-smart outdated bots including Fender (Robin Williams), his spunky kid sister Piper (voiced by Amanda Bynes), Crank (Drew Carey), and Aunt Fanny (Jennifer Coolidge- that would be Stiffler's mom from American Pie folks).<br /><br />The main cast is only further extenuated by a back up cast that includes Halle Berry, Greg Kinnear, Paul Giamatti, Jay Leno, Paula Abdul, Terry Bradshaw, Al Roker and James Earl Jones reprising his famous Darth Vader voice.<br /><br />Vocal word aside, the film just plain works on many levels.  The visuals border on sensory overload at times with almost too much going on in the backgrounds.  Multiple viewings are mandatory to fully absorb all of the gags and laughs going on somewhere in the distance at all times.<br /><br />The humor itself is layered enough to where adults will find themselves snickering at much of the dialog/ sociological (and sometimes light sexual) references while the kiddies will be sufficiently entertained by the sheer novelty of watching the bots' onscreen interaction.<br /><br />Comparisons to Pixar's Wall-E are inevitable due to the nature of the protagonists but in all honesty, the two projects have about as much in common as Star Trek and Buck Rogers (but they're both about space right?).  Where Wall-E tells the tale of a solitary garbage-cleaning robot on earth and his unlikely journey toward repopulating the planet, Robots is a family-based coming of age comedy in an all-robot world (in fact there is no reference to humanity ever having existed here).<br /><br />Perhaps the piece's greatest strength is it is one of few that I am aware of that actually demands the computer-animated medium to get its point across.  In other words, while many CG features look pretty, their stories could just as easily have been told in 2D art or even live-action.  Robots, however, is not one of them! Between mass-transit systems seemingly inspired by the board game Mouse Trap to oceanic tides of dominoes, this one could be realized no other way!<br /><br />In all Robots is a fun-filled romp from start to finish with enough comedy to keep viewers of all ages paying very close attention both to the onscreen antics and the dialog exchanges (Robin Williams is a rapid fire joke machine that doesn't ease up for a second).<br /><br />While it's true Pixar and DreamWorks continue to try to outdo one another with each animated effort, Blue Sky has been steadily delivering fantastic feature films that emulate nothing out there.  Robots continues this tradition with style.entertained by the sheer novelty of watching the bots' onscreen interaction.

B002G7CZTO|2.0|I am about half way through this book and I have to say I am not thrilled with it.  While there are some valuable insights listed throughout, it is not an engaging read, nor have I found a lot of scientific basis.  Mostly, the author talks about her own highly sensitive nature and how she has tailored her life to fit in with \\"normal\\" (as she calls them) people.  She also mentions her husband and his \\"world famous\\" studies a lot.  There are \\"exercises\\" for you to do at the end of each chapter, but I haven't felt them to be of any significance.  I'm actually tempted to not finish the book, but I will persevere in the hope that I will learn something from it.  If I had it to do over again, I would find a different book on this subject.

B003XX2PPO|4.0|I could never with a good conscience give Luis Miguel below 3 stars for any album he has done.  Well maybe the ones he has done in the 80's fall below average, but whenever you buy a Luis Miguel album you get excellence.  His productions are immaculate, and his golden voice are recorded with utter detail.  This album is no exception.  What makes this album worth the price alone is that one of the greatest songwriter Armando Manzanero wrote a couple of songs.  The songs that are written by Manzanero are among the best songs on this album.  It has passionate lyrics, and Luis Miguels vocal delivery gets better with each album he does.  Just hear a sample of \\"No Existen Limites\\" and you can his voice soar beautifully in the tenor stratosphere.  This album is done in a pop format, rather than his romance formulated albums.  This might be one of the better pop albums he has put out in years.  The released single \\"Labios De Miel\\" is an upbeat, happy, and catchy tune. The whole album has a happy feel to it.  It has very up vibe compared to his past famous albums that have more of a heartache feel to it.  The artwork on this cd sleeve explains it all.  This is the album you put on when you are in love, not in a break up.  Now all that being said this album is a 5 star album, but yet I gave it 4 stars and here is my reason.  Since the early 90's I have bought majority of his albums on his release date including this one.  I always look forward for what his next progression is, and his romance albums do not vary very far artistically from one another.  I have no problems with that, but here I am in 2010 buying a Luis Miguel pop album, and it's the same formula.  The brass oriented dance songs, the same ballad structure we've heard since \\"No Se Tu\\".  Otherwise, it lacks a contemporary feel.  The last time I heard a pop album of his that was contemporary for it's time was Nada Es Igual(1996).  After so many years I feel it's worth noting.  As for the romance albums, and thebolleros that he sings I don't mind if he keeps doing the same kind of production.  That orchestrated sound in reality is what makes Luis Miguel great.  It's his style and he should not change it for no one, but when it comes to pop that is a different matter.  I feel that this album's production such as the brass synth, and the celestial keyboard sounds he uses for all of his ballads that we are accustomed of hearing have been the same since his Busca Una Mujer(1988) pop album.  If Luis Miguel wants to still keep the brass and violins in his pop albums that is fine with me, but the production and the style of writing has to change just a bit.  Like the song \\"Siento\\" for example has a keyboard player playing a solo on a noticeable harmonica sample on his keys.  Why?  You brought in a real brass section and a orchestra in studio.  Why not get a real harmonica player?  The keyboard in this case should have been utilized for more modern sounds rather than replicating an organic instrument.  I know that Luis Miguel produces his own album, but maybe it needs a fresh minded producer when it comes to pop.  Please do not let my negative comments be a deterrent  from buying this album.  Like I said before with Manzanero on board it's worth the price of admission, and the truth be told if Luis Miguel came out with an album all done in acapella I will still be there buying it on it's release date.

B001UV4XUG|3.0|I would give it between 5/6 out of 10. The movie was very watchable, kept my interest, had a cool filming style, but I just felt meh about it. To be clear, I was not expecting a love story, particularly since they state in the beginning that it's not. So I was fine w/that aspect.<br /><br />First: the acting. I remember as a kid going to see JGL in \\"Angels in the Outfield.\\" He's charming in the role of a love-sick, naive young guy. I especially got a kick out of the dancing scene. A totallyrandom scene, but it reminded me of how when we are extrahappy, we start dancing. In our rooms, in the copy room at work..sometimes we just get happy. As for Zooey D, I don't see her appeal. I don't seek out her movies, but every movie I've seen her in,she's a quirky, flakey, Mary Sue. Is it always the role or is some ofit her real self poking through? I don't know. However, it reminds me of Drew Barrymore....she just has a ditzy quality that gets tiresome when it's in every movie I see that she happens to be in. I also didn't find her to be the best-looking lady in the movie, so all of the intro in the beginning about her was a bit hollow. I thought the redhead blind date was more attractive even if she had 5 mins of screen time. This plays into the Mary Sue aspect of Summer's character.<br /><br />As for the story, it was clear that the movie would end up being about how he got over Summer. I was looking forward to that. However, the execution left a little to be desired. Tom definitely allowed himself to be used by Summer, however, I'm of the opinion that had she gone beyond her initial \\"I don't want a relationship,\\" and nipped everything completely in the bud, he would have gotten the hint. Summer had zero redeemable qualities in my eyes. She definitely used his feelings to her benefit, and if the roles were reversed, Tom would be the quintessential jerk. She was highly manipulative and she just strung him along. Something was definitely wrong with her in that she was OK usinghim KNOWING his feelings w/her. It was easier to identify with Tom and his ridiculous naivety bc he was emotional. We knew his motivations, but did not know hers. When I watch movies, whether I like characters or not, I feel writers should give us inclinations as to their motivation. Note: this doesn't make them likeable, it just makes them more understandable. There's absolutely no reason to act \\"relationship-y\\" with a person whom you KNOW wants it when you don't. After a fight where the guy/girl is upset bc he feels that you're in a relationship but you won't admit that it kinda is....only a girlfriend/boyfriend figure goes over to that person's house in the middle of the night and sleeps with them. Not a person who wishes to have boundaries. None of her behavior said \\"friends.\\" Actually, now that I think of it, her reasons were \\"because I wanted to.\\" Just a cold, selfish person.<br /><br />The part of the movie that killed it for me was when she got married and told Tom that with the new hubby \\"she was sure of what she wasn't sure of w/Tom.\\" *Cue head scratching* So was that a throwaway \\"insightful\\" line or was she lying when she said she didn't want a relationship? She got married very soon after she met Tom, so w/that scene, the writers negated a lot of her personality and just made her an unlikeable character.<br /><br />The ending was a bit cheesy, but whatever. It's a decent movie to pass time, but you'll probably leave with the same \\"meh\\" feeling I did.

B003ITZBW2|4.0|Being the first full-length Batman animated movie in a long time that had one consistant story to it(Gotham Knight not withstanding), the latest movie, Under The Red Hood is a retelling of the Under The Hood story arc from the Batman comics. This is a bold new direction for DC Universe by taking a character they've tried selling as being more family-oriented in productions like Batman: Brave And The Bold, and bringing the one that most die-hard comic readers can identify with on the level of The Dark Knight.<br /><br />The story begins in the past with Joker under the payroll of Ra's Al Ghul keeping Batman and Robin #2(Jason Todd)busy while he tries yet again to take over the world. However, the Joker \\"shockingly\\" goes way overboard, and kills Robin. Fast forward to five years later where a new masked man called the Red Hood is shaking up things in Gotham City by slowly taking over territory of local crime lord, Black Mask. Batman busts up a delivery of an Amazo robot with the help of Nightwing, but the goons smuggling it are taken out by the Red Hood. Originally, the Red Hood was the alias that the Joker used before he was given his permanent skin bleach. Bats and Nightwing check with Joker in locked in Arkham to see if he's got any connection to this new Red Hood, but even your novice Bat-Fan could tell you the real Joker would've let you know if it was him. The Dynamic-former-Duo track down Hoodie robbing some pushers, but Nightwing hoits his widdle toe, and spends the rest of the movie on the bench. Black Mask sends out the Fearsome Hand Of Four after Red Mask, who are a team of cyber-ninjas original to the movie, but Batman shows up and they fold that deck together. Batman then deduces that R.H. is really Jason Todd, and takes the Batwing over to the other side of the world to have a chat with Ra's Al Ghul. Ra's revealed that he tried making amends for causing Jason to die by dipping him in his time-honored plot device, the Lazarus Pit. Jason came back, but pissed off as Hell, and escaped from Ra's. After hearing this, Batman zooms back to Gotham, to find that Black Mask sprung Joker out of Arkham to kill Red Hood, but Joker doublecrossed him(suprise!), and uses him as bait to lure out his current successor. Red Hood makes off with Joker, and gets Batman to meet him in Crime Alley. Red Hood unmasks to show is indeed Jason Todd. Jason then corners Batman into either choosing between shooting him or Joker, which he stops Jason, and the building they're in blows up. Batman and Joker survive, but Jason's fate remains unknown. The movie ends with Batman reflecting on when Jason first became Robin.<br /><br />First, I'd like to say how this movie differs from the comics. In the original context, Jason Todd was brought back to life mainly because the evil Superboy-Prime \\"punched reality\\", and made it so Jason came back to life, although recent retellings of Red Hood's origin also include him backstoking in a Lazarus Pit. There's ben alot of retconning involving Jason's resurrection, but the movie managed to pull it all together well. A few other things like the Black Mask hiring some C-List supervillains from the Secret Society instead of the \\"Hand Of Four\\" from the original story, although it makes more sense for them to have Batman taking on Mortal Kombat wannabes instead of Captain Nazi, even though they could've had them be the Royal Flush Gang or some other recognizable DC villains. There was also the rewrite of the Death In The Family story where Joker blows up Robin in the middle east, instead of Europe. Plus, no supervillain would ever be stupid or desperate enough to hire the Joker to do anything, and certainly not a criminal mastermind like Ra's Al Ghul! Nightwing was also a little to flippant in this, like freaking out over the Amazo shooting lasers at him, which he should be used to after being with the Titans. Another character who was out of place was Black Mask, who is usually alot more cool and calculating, wherehere he was way more hotheaded.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, I think this one has the best animation out of any of the other DC Universe movies, including some of the shorts from Gotham Knight. The city backgrounds look like it might be taking place in the actual downtown New York instead of fictional Gotham City, despite the fact that there are still police blimps in it. The character designs are awesome too, and Joker really looks menacing for once. Speaking of Mr. J, John DiMaggio(aka: \\"Bender\\")does a bang-up job as Joker by bringing in influences of both Mark Hamill and Heath Ledger. Bruce Greenwood is fair as Bats, but he's no Kevin Conroy. Jason Ackles is good as Jason Todd, and Neil Patrick Harris makes for a decent Nightwing. My only real low grade on the movie is that it should've ended on a more realistic note instead of just some happy flashback with young Jason Todd. The special edition DVD and Blu-Ray versions also feature a killer DC Showcase animated short of Jonah Hex starring Thomas Jane which is waaaay better than that crappy live-action movie, plus a decent documentary on Dick Grayson as Robin. So, in closing, I'd wholeheartedly demand that any Bat-Fan should store this in their cave between the giant penny and robot dinosaur!more hotheaded.

1862302138|4.0|This is the first of Wormell's George and the Dragon books which parody traditional dragonslaying fairy tales. In this story, the mouse George moves into a hole next door to a mouse-phobic dragon, and pays the dragon a visit just as he is about to devour a fair princess.  The dragon's response is predictable.  Like [[ASIN:1862301867 George, the Dragon and the Princess]], this story is lighthearted, silly and well executed.  Wormell's high-quality artwork is full of action and drama, making this a great story for crowds or quiet family reading.  It is accessible to a preschool audience but will also be appreciated by elementary readers.

0465092764|1.0|Stop. Wrong way. Turn back. The book you actually want to buy is Lee Smolin's \\"The trouble with physics\\" [[ASIN:061891868X The Trouble With Physics: The Rise of String Theory, The Fall of a Science, and What Comes Next]]    Lee Smolin's book is a page turner on the subject of the failure of string theory. In contrast this book is a page skipper, as you really struggle with trying to not to skip past the boring lecture given on the history of science to date. The problem is that the boring lecture-style history of science to date takes up 50% of the book (145 pages!!)    The remainder, dedicated to string theory, is badly explained relying on selective quotes from leading string theorists to back up his position. In fact, \\"badly explained\\" is the recurring theme in this book, which makes me wonder in fact how much the author actually understands.    In the end , unless you are already familiar with what's wrong with string theory (or had read Lee Smolin's book) you are simply left with the impression that the failure of string theory was simply the author's opinion , and open for debate.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|When I first saw this movie in the theater, I knew I had to have it on DVD when released. However, it was not until watching it the second time in the theater that I discovered that so much happened in such an overwhelming way in the movie that there were quite a few things I had not remembered from the first viewing. They were both in 3D. Blu-Ray is not 3D, but the colors are much more vivid than standard DVD. We thoroughly enjoyed it and it stays on the top of our list. I highly recommend it to anyone who does not mind being enchanted.
B002N5N4MG|5.0|We all know what an awesome show the Big Bang is, and there are several other reviews that go over that here, but I see none addressing what I was wondering the most when I pre-ordered my copy--how's the picture quality and audio on the Blu-Ray? While I really wasn't expecting much from a sitcom (this is no summer blockbuster or \\"Lost\\"), the picture really improves. I did notice some artifacting, and the bitrate is at around 15mbps (in comparison, the previous seasons on DVD were at around 5mbps, and top quality Blu-Rays like \\"Lost,\\" \\"Dexter\\" or \\"The Dark Knight\\" are at around 25mbps), but again, for a sitcom, I think that is more than enough. The DVD releases looked pretty good as it was, but this really brings out the colors (like in Howard's wardrobe) and much much less digital grain. The sound is as good as a sitcom gets. Overall, for the price, and if you own a Blu-Ray player, I can't see why you wouldn't want to pick up the Blu-Ray instead. The menus are interactive and work a lot better than DVDs menus. Totally worth the wait and the few extra bucks!
0374158460|2.0|Many intelligent, well-meaning people will mistake--have mistaken--Freedom for a good novel.<br /><br />But many (perhaps most) intelligent, well-meaning people are masochists, who mistake pain for love and grief for insight. Children of the Old Testament, they worship a spiteful God, a scornful God, and their attitude towards themselves and the rest of humanity can be succinctly summarized as: We get what we deserve (as long as what we get is bad).<br /><br />We shouldn't be surprised, then, that those same people embrace a book whose primary ambition is the systematic annihilation of its characters. That ambition confirms a worldview that they've been trained since infancy to enjoy.<br /><br />I know that most of the great characters in the history of the novel are annihilated by their authors. The reasons for that are complex and most certainly worth considering. But the novel's primary ambition has never been annihilation. Great novelists are not sadists. Tolstoy takes no pleasure in Anna Karenina's demise.<br /><br />What, then, is a novel's primary ambition?<br /><br />To re-concieve God. To displace the Sacred Texts in the moral and intellectual life of its audience.<br /><br />Any novel attempting something else is not worth reading.<br /><br />Novels attempt this re-conception very simply: they create a world, and by doing so propose a new idea of the Divine. We--the audience, humanity--experience this divinity (and, by extension, our own humanity) mostly through the novel's characters, feeling life through them, for them. What happens to Emma Bovary, to Raskolnikov, to Anna Karenina, to Herzog in fact only happens to us.<br /><br />So to judge a book is to judge the theology of its creator, and particularly the creator's idea of humanity.<br /><br />Which bring us to Freedom.<br /><br />Like The Corrections, Freedom is the ambitious attempt to contemplate a particular moment in American life. It presents itself as a social novel. It follows the lives of some decent middle-class liberal Americans through the hideous years of the Bush Administration.<br /><br />That sounds like a worthwhile project. Why, then, do I find the book objectionable?<br /><br />Four reasons: 1) its sadistic attitude toward its characters (and therefore toward its readers); 2) its incompetent use of free indirect speech; 3) its gaudy symbolism; and 4) its theological conviction that we achieve redemption through suffering.<br /><br />Let's consider each point individually:<br /><br />1) Until the end of the book (see 4!), absolutely everything that happens to the book's characters is bad. Dully, sadistically, characteristically, insignificantly bad.<br /><br />2) The incoherence of the characters--the chasm between their situation and their language--cannot be excused as postmodern truthiness. It's simply not possible that Franzen's characters think as they do when he permits them to narrate the book. And all novels have an obligation to remain possible. To abandon the possible is always artistic failure.<br /><br />3) When one of the main characters, who has fled his young bride, recognizes the errors of his ways when he's searching through his own excrement for his wedding ring, I conclude that the author doesn't trust his character's (which means his audience's) intelligence. It's incumbent upon all novelists to leave their sledgehammers at home.<br /><br />4) The sentimentality of Freedom's final pages, when Franzen finally relents and permits his characters a modicum of happiness, serve to reinforce the tediously bourgeois (or, more specifically, Christian) notion that only by suffering do we find redemption. In this regard the novel is an intellectual disappointment, a return to the dreary safety of received, clich&eacute; ideas.<br /><br />At some point one must take a stand.

B002YE452Y|5.0|This is undoubtedly one of the best albums of Shakira. The tracks I like best are: She Wolf, Loba, Why Wait and Did It Again. The CD that was already great, was excellent in this Deluxe Edition, which includes live tracks and a bonus DVD. It is worth checking. I recommend!!
0307594777|5.0|I finished the trilogy and it was a fun read (to say the least).  I give it 5 stars and recommend it to those who enjoy mystery/thrillers.  The characters (and there are a lot) are interesting, well developed and believable (I wish I could invite Salander and Blomkvist to dinner).  The plot is also believable, with lots of surprises and twists.   As \\"trite\\" as the saying goes, this really is a \\"page turner\\"!  You've got to pay attention, though; it takes place in Sweden with a lot (A LOT) of Swedish names of characters, places and organizations to keep straight and remember.  The ending was a little \\"hokey\\" and contrived (my opinion), but I'll forgive Larsson.    Steig Larsson has passed away and we've lost a great story teller; I'm certain we would have not heard the end of the girl with the dragon tattoo,  Lisbeth Salander.
0452286751|2.0|Toohey gets shot at, and tells the press that of course he's not pressing charges and that he wishes they'd just let the shooter go? What kind of nonsense is that? It's ridiculous!!!
0312600844|1.0|This is total rubbish, backed by the Globalist agenda. Just look up \\"New World Order.\\" The book implies that freedom is bad: As each of us seeks to assert his \\"personal liberties\\" -- a phrase Franzen uses with full command of its ideological implications -- we helplessly collide with others in equal pursuit of their sacred freedoms, which, more often than not, seem to threaten our own. It is no surprise, then, that \\"the personality susceptible to the dream of limitless freedom is a personality also prone, should the dream ever sour, to misanthropy and rage,\\" as Franzen remarks. FREEDOM is what made America great and the globalists are trying to destroy that greatness. They want a one world government and that won't be a democracy or a republic. It will be tyrannical. WAKE UP !
B000UR9QIK|5.0|It's been years since I've seen this movie. None of my local stores carried DotD, and miraculously I found it, on blu-ray, for $10. Although movies back then weren't as advanced as now, the quality in HD makes Tom Savini and George Romero's work really come to life. If you have a brain, or any left at all*nom nom*, you will take advantage of this classic in HD. It's a perfect price and a perfect addition in your horror collection. Do it... Do it...
0312600844|4.0|look at our sense of entitlement in doing whatever we want under the guise of freedom.  The book is an insightful case study of what happens when inherently selfish human beings pursue conflicting and intersecting goals.  The author's description and observation are finely drawn, uncomfortably too close at times, and really funny.  The structure of the book really allowed each character to standout and for the reader to gain an acute sense of who they are and their motivations.  The characters are always shown in the unflinching cold light of day, showing all of their vulnerabilities, unsavoriness, and decency.  The fragility and enduring toughness of relationships are rendered so truthfully by the author, the book was more like a documentary.  The only part of the book that seemed a bit contrived for me was the Walter/Patty ending.  It is obvious where the author's political leanings lie; however, this fiscal conservative/social liberal thought that he was pretty fair in taking aim at and highlighting the hypocrisies and absurdities of both sides/parties.  I read the book in about two days on my new Kindle - I don't know if others have experienced this, but I seem to read books faster on the Kindle.
0061245097|5.0|A friend of mine once told me I shouldn't read books that do not enrich my life (read: vampire mysteries/romance/night huntress books are trash!). My response was: if for an hour a day a book takes me away from the monotony of my life, from the stress of my career, from whiny kids,and a needy husband it is definitely enriching my life:)That's why I love the Night Huntress books. The heroine, Cat Crawfield, is a strong role model for all women. And even though she's tough and independent, she's not immune to great love. She shows women that you can be in love with a man, but still be strong and remain true to yourself and your values. Great book! Great series!
B002BU0DPE|5.0|I had purchased the P21's which only worked for the PS3 back in Christmas time last year and LOVED them.  I also have an XBOX 360 and was a little upset that they were coming out with a newer version (PX21's) that also worked for the XBOX, especially after paying the same price.  But I guess I should have done more research.  Anyways, I ended up selling my P21's and put that $ down towards buying these.  And I'm not dissapointed one bit.  They worked perfectly on both systems and gotta say that the sound was somewhat better on these.  Seemed like the sound cues were more defined on the PX21's than on my old headset.  Another plus the longer cords.  Now you can actually sit a distance away without any tugging.  All in all, I'm pretty happy with the upgrade.
B002FE5XVK|5.0|It doesn't make sense that I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS CONCERT even though I am not really a fan of Talking Heads. I did not know any of those songs with the exception of \\"Once In a Lifetime\\". Also, it doesn't make sense that this is probably the highest rated concert out there surpassing ratings of concerts from heavy weight (say, more popular) artists. This must be the beauty of non-sense. Seriously, this is such a fun concert to watch. It doesn't have any extravagant set decorations or fancy lightening works that signature many rock concerts. So why is this concert so great?<br /><br />Here's why I think this concert is so great: 1) It is a very intimate venue - that makes it unique. The set is very cozy and feels like the band is playing in their living room. 2) It takes a great music to make a great concert. And the music here is fantastic. I am not sure how commercially successfull Talking Heads were back in those days but maybe their music sounds better in concerts. 3) Musicians are sincerely having fun and playing great music at the same time. This makes it a very sincere performance. I absolutely love the dancing of back vocalists. 4) David Byrne (singer/frontman) is a real character; his dance, his performance is so different so unique yet so sincere at the same time.<br /><br />If you like great music and concerts, it wouldn't make sense for you to skip this one. So first, act sensibly and get this DVD and then later you can stop making sense :-)

B002L3RVCY|5.0|For starters, if you have not seen the Clone Wars movie, you might want to start with it before getting this set.  The movie sets up a lot of the basis behind new characters involved in this series such as Anakan Skywalker's Padawan (Ahsoka Tano), and Count Dookus Apprentice or assassin, Asajj Ventress. These two characters will be involved with many of the tales without any history provided short of the movie.  Now on to the series.    When I first played it I was not completely engulfed into it (like a Star Wars movie), but once I got adjusted to the animation and the storyline picked up I was hooked.  It is as action Packed as the Star Wars films.  And although it might not have exactly the same actors who played in the movies voicing their character, the voice over actors are great and almost sound like the actor who originally played each part.  The only time I really noticed it was when Count Dooku emerged.  You can tell that this is not Christopher Lee voicing the character.  Not that it does not sound like Christopher Lee, it is just that the voice over actor is actually better at playing this part than Lee. The plot line of most episodes are well written and will please most Star Wars fans (Even those who call themselves Trekkers).      The case this set comes in is as unique as the show itself.  It is not a standard plastic case with a leaflet or two thrown inside.  It is a Book that has two sturdy holders on each hardback book cover to hold your dvds in place.  As a bonus it includes a 66 page book in the center featuring concept drawings of the show and other items of interest used in the development of this show. Overall 4.5 stars for the show, 5 stars for packaging, and 5 stars for the extras.    Overall this set is well worth the price and makes an excellent show to watch.  Can't wait to get the second season.
0316098337|5.0|Imagine a room. It's 11 feet by 11 feet --- about the size of your average bedroom, perhaps. Inside is a bed, a dresser, a table, a shelf on the wall, a trash can, a television, a small refrigerator and a stove, and a small bathroom with a tub. Everything you own is in the room. There are no windows, only a skylight. Now imagine that skylight is covered with a carbon mesh that makes the glass impossible to break. The floor has been reinforced with chain link to make it impossible to dig up. No one can enter or leave the room unless they have the security code. The walls have been soundproofed so that no one can hear you scream.    This is the room --- a horrifically tricked-out garden shed, actually --- where Jack's Ma has lived for the past seven years, ever since she was kidnapped from college at the age of 19, trapped in this room and forced to have sex repeatedly with her captor (known to Jack as \\"Old Nick\\"), who visits daily. And this is the room where Jack was born five years ago, the only world he's ever known. As kids are prone to do, Jack names the inhabitants of Room: there's Table, Fort (made of empty boxes and cans) Labyrinth (made of empty toilet paper rolls) and Plant. But mostly, there's Jack and there's Ma. As far as Jack is concerned, they're the only two people in the world. And Room is the world. Ma decided a long time ago to maintain this fiction for Jack, to tell him that everything he sees on television, even the local news, is as make-believe as the Dora the Explorer cartoon he loves most of all.    That is, until Ma, plagued by ill health and worried about their captor's increasing financial instability, decides to try to escape. Her first step is to tell Jack to \\"unlie,\\" as he puts it, to let him know that there is a whole world outside their four walls, a wonderful world that he's never seen. Jack's attempts to process these unimaginable concepts result in some of the book's most poignant reflections: \\"The sea's real, I'm just remembering.It's all real in Outside, everything there is, because I saw the airplane in the blue between the clouds. Ma and me can't go there because we don't know the secret code, but it's real all the same. Before I didn't even know to be mad that we can't open Door, my head was too small to have Outside in it. When I was a little kid I thought like a little kid, but now I'm five I know everything.\\" And, of course, if Jack and Ma can escape from Room, they'll both face new challenges unlike any they've met before.    As I was reading Emma Donoghue's new novel, I often had to put it down for a while, overwhelmed by what I was reading. The content is devastating, to be sure, but just as affecting is her ability to capture, in small moments and spot-on phrases, the inner life of a little boy who has lived through experiences most of us could barely imagine.    Of course, the pathos inherent in Jack's situation and his endearingly naïve narrative voice are only the beginning of the myriad issues Donoghue explores in ROOM. Parents and caregivers will ache for Ma --- for the choices she has to make (each day while \\"Old Nick\\" is at work, the two of them scream for a while, as loud as they can, and then, in Jack's words, \\"we shush, with fingers on lips. I asked Ma once what we're listening for and she said just in case, you never know.\\"), for the fierce love she has for her son, for the million ways, for his sake, she makes the best of a hellish situation. Despite their extreme circumstances, Ma is really just like any other parent, doing the best she can with the resources she has, doing all she can to preserve her son's happiness, which, for her, is often the only reason to get up in the morning.    What's most remarkable about ROOM is that, despite its obvious parallels to certain much-hyped real-life cases, Donoghue appears to take great pains not only to eschew sensationalism in her own writing but also to inject a measure of hope and wonder. Although Ma's re-entry into the world is fraught with frustrations, sadness and overwhelming emotions, and although Jack's entry into Outside for the first time is marked by fears and misunderstandings, his narrative of discovery is also a remarkable window on the world. In many ways, Jack is like a hyper-literate, painstakingly observant newborn, taking in the world and all its wonders and terrors for the first time, but able to narrate his experience.    Reading ROOM is, in many ways, like opening that Door and making those discoveries --- many of which we take for granted --- alongside him. On meeting Jack, most readers will want to hold his hand or bundle him into their arms and cry a while. But then they'll be eager to walk with him into Outside, to see it, as if through his eyes, for the first time.        --- Reviewed by Norah Piehl

0439023513|3.0|I really loved the first two books from the Hunger Games series but I was sadly disappointed by this book.  More gruesome and sad than the previous books, Mockingjay brought closure to the series at a high price.  I usually reread books I really enjoy.  This is not on my list.
B00406UK7S|2.0|... In fact a lethal overdose of blood.<br /><br />How could I not love this movie? Gladiator was one of my all-time favourites, I love Braveheart, and Apocalypto IS still my favourite, so how can I not love this one? Shallow is the magic word. This movie tries to live off its shock value. The gore is presented with gay abandon almost as if it were the main focus point of the film. And maybe it is, I don't know, didn't care to finish it.<br /><br />The frustrating thing is the setting has great potential. Romans are fighting some rebellious tribes in the far north of Britain. You gotta love rebels. Except this movie shows things from the Romans' perspective, which is a let-down, but the deal-breaking flaw is that flying body parts rule the screen, except the heart is missing.<br /><br />3 out of 10 just for the potential.

030726999X|1.0|Yes, it's true, there is a certain pleasure in the exotic locale and the complicated plots, but the weird voyeuristic enjoyment of the woman warrior that characterizes this trilogy made me queasy. This quality got more and more pronounced as I made my way through volumes 2 and 3. These sequels were also all too lengthy, as I became painfully aware as I slogged my way through them, ultimately motivated only by the desire to be done. My advice: Read novel #1 and take a pass on the second and third volumes of the trilogy. I know I'm in a minority, but that's the path I wish I'd taken. The world is full of great books; why spend your time reading the more than 1200 pages that make up the final two volumes of this series? Nothing here makes the effort worth the time.
0439023483|5.0|The Hunger Games was recommended to me and I am glad it was.  It is not probably a book I would have picked up otherwise primarily because it is classified as a young persons book.  Just goes to show you--never judge a book by it's cover, so to speak!  The book tells the tale of a 16 year old girl by the name of Katniss Overdeen.  Katniss lives in a North America of the future and a brutal place it is.  North America is divided up into 12 divisions.   Every year a girl and a boy is chosen from each division and it is a fight to the death.  After reading this, one may ask--WHY would I want to read a book about this?  Because Katniss is brave, she is loving, she has heart and the reader really cares about her.  Also, there are others in this book that only add to the book's gripping conclusion.  The author does a terrific job of pacing so the pages just fly and I could feel my stomach clench when a particularly dangerous situation comes up--which is darn near all of the time!  Loved it!

B003JTHXOK|4.0|I'm a big Nicholas Sparks fan, and although I agree with many other reviews that I liked a lot of his previous books much better than this one, I still really enjoyed this book.  I thought the climax of the book was really good (I felt myself becoming extremely tense), but I thought the ending was, well, a little corny.  But all in all, it was a book that I finished in two days, and still really enjoyed. I would definitely recommend it as a nice, easy read.     I was also a bit peeved that the kindle price was only like a dollar cheaper than the hardback version, but I know that isn't controlled by the author, so my review is strictly based upon the book itself, not the price!
B001DCQI8W|5.0|Piety and modesty of Jochum, Transcendental spirituality of Furtwangler.  Karajan's Bruckner is different. It is more like polished up Bentley, or Rolls Royce if you like Rolls better.    The music is polished every inch by Karajan and the virtuosity of Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.  The sound is  so heavenly, I tend to forget to listen to the music. I just enjoy whisper of strings and roar of horns.  Is it because of my new Marantz CD player and Aesthetix tube amp? Maybe.   In any case, digital transfer is excellent; sans usual Karajan glare and screeching first violin.  I own analog LPs for these recordings and found this CD release much more enjoyable.    Gorgeous sound and budget price tag.  A must have for music lovers!
B0009S2T0M|4.0|I watch sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and learned about Oldboy. I really like Sympathy and thought I'd check this film out. All I ever heard were positive remarks about the film all of which I disregarded. As soon as I start checking out reviews and hearing the majority talking about the same thing I know I'm getting jipped. One person says they like this and another says the same thing and another then another and soon no one has an opinion of their own because they do want to say something different. They just end up jumping on the same horse that the last man got off of.<br /><br /> When I checked up on this film I kept hearing about how Quintin Tarantino loved it. That right there was my first sign that I'd hate it. I hate Quintin Tarantino's films and I don't think these anyone out there than can be as successful as him when it comes to making the same movie over and over again and being praised for it. All of his movies have the same vibe, heavy language, goofy story and oddball characters, pretentious philosophies, and of course the cameo where Quintin polishes his own knob. It's this mixture that always made me dislike his films. It's like his movies just don't take themselves seriously no matter what it's about.<br /><br />Understanding that Quintin Tortito loved this film I knew I was in for a film I probably wouldn't like. So I sat down and decided to give the film an open minded shot. It took me some time to really get into the film. I watched the first 20 minutes and stopped when our hero started masturbating himself. Already the style reminded me of a Tarintino film and I shut it off and shelved it. Only after hearing the movie pop up again some time later I decided to give it another try. What I found was a movie that progressed from \\"quirky\\" to dark to serious to dark to serious to \\"light comedy\\" to serious and then it ended. The film was able to make up it mind and settled on the fact that this film is an actual drama. This isn't a Tarintino film! This film knows what it wants to be and thank goodness!<br /><br /> Oldboy deserves all the praise it gets for making you laugh but cry knowing that the main character only smiles because he really wants to cry. He starts out as raving drunk,then becomes hostile,then becomes vengeful, then he becomes merciless and pathetic. You don't realize until the end that the man character is as vulnerable as anyone else. That was the real twist of this movie. It's not about a revenge seeker that ends with him standing over his enemies in triumph. It's about a hollow victory and never being able to achieve that satisfaction.<br /><br />With spoiling any of the movie it's hard to talk about any of the scenes or the amazing character development. This is the first movie I've seen in a long time where I couldn't guess what was going to happen next AND I KNEW WHAT THE TABOO SECRET WAS! and I still was caught off guard. I'm very glad that I did stick around to complete watching this film because it is a great movie that deserves all credit given to it.<br /><br />4 Stars for a great film<br />-1 Star because I didn't enjoy the ending (for reasons I can't say without spoiling the film).what it wants to be and thank goodness!     Oldboy deserves all the praise it gets for making you laugh but cry knowing that the main character only smiles because he really wants to cry.

It's not about a revenge seeker that ends with him standing over his enemies in triumph. It's about a hollow victory and never being able to achieve that satisfaction.    With spoiling any of the movie it's hard to talk about any of the scenes or the amazing character development. This is the first movie I've seen in a long time where I couldn't guess what was going to happen next AND I KNEW WHAT THE TABOO SECRET WAS! and I still was caught off guard. I'm very glad that I did stick around to complete watching this film because it is a great movie that deserves all credit given to it.     4 Stars for a great film  -1 Star because I didn't enjoy the ending (for reasons I can't say without spoiling the film).
0345472322|5.0|Carol Dweck's \\"Mindset\\" is, bar none, one the best books I've ever read about change, mindset, motivation, growth, and learning.  Sophisticated, funny, articulate, accessible and well-researched, \\"Mindset\\" should become a standard requirement in understanding and improving education, business, and personal relationships.  \\"Mindset\\" adds a powerful and useful dimension to change discussion and provides tools and analysis superior in clarity and maturity to the sea of self-help books out there.  It leaves the the \\"men are from Mars, women from Venus\\"-type books in the dust and far outstrips the maudlin attempts at change management one sees in books like \\"Who Moved My Cheese.\\"<br /><br />\\"Mindset\\" brings our attention, with resonant examples, to the critical and deep dispositions we hold, that largely determine our personal styles and our possibilities.  Just as importantly, however, \\"Mindset\\" shows us how we might transform our dispositions to thrive in relation to change and therefore go beyond simply accepting our dispositions as fixed.  Typical books follow the label-prescribe-solve formula:  \\"You are 'this' so you must do 'that.'  Here are some exercises.\\"  This book, by grateful contrast, lays out the ground work for exploring one's personality, working on one's habits, and creatively engaging learning in a way that develops practice and awareness in addressing one's outlooks toward change (including how one responds to failure).<br /><br />I can't think of a better book to prepare one well for the emerging future in our fast transforming world.  I find the central dynamic of this book between a \\"fixed\\" and \\"growth\\" mindset to be the crucial issue of our current creative, dynamic, and multicultural global era.  Because it resists labels and welcomes exploration, Dweck's interesting and useful discussion goes beyond even some of the better research in the field while still retaining a compelling, grounded, and forward-looking focus.  As a scientist and philosopher of learning and an activist and transformer of education, It is refreshing for me to read a book so remarkably free of the foundational flaws that prevent effective change discussion.  \\"Mindset\\" has a way of \\"working\\" on you in a way that is both playful and serious in the best sense of those words.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended, Zeus Yiamouyiannis, Ph.D., Learning Consultantr of learning and an activist and transformer of education, It is refreshing for me to read a book so remarkably free of the foundational flaws that prevent effective change discussion.  \\"Mindset\\" has a way of \\"working\\" on you in a way that is both playful and serious in the best sense of those words.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended, Zeus Yiamouyiannis, Ph.D., Learning Consultant

They have some great activities, however I would suggest ripping the pages out because the book is so thick it makes it difficult to lay the pages out flat and get them to write or draw correctly. Some of the activities are way too easy but many of them are challenging.

0439023513|4.0|I have been a big fan of this series from when I read the first. I was really looking forward to this last one in the series. It was exciting and suspenseful when it needed to be but I was also very depressed about the book, especially the ending, although I don't know why I should expect a happy smiley ending in the post-\\"end of the world\\" Panem. I didn't like the fact that anyone that is facing difficulty is drugged to numb the pain. I was also slightly unhappy about the character development of the relationships between Katniss/Peeta, Katniss/Gale. I know Katniss had to end up with who she did but I just didn't feel like she was happy with that decision and neither Peeta or Gale were able to prove why or why not they should be with Katniss. Still overall it was enjoyable.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|\\"Hornets' Nest\\" picks up as literally the next chapter after \\"Fire.\\"  At first this seemed a little contrived but the book took off on its own and in my opinion, may be the best of the three.  \\"Hornets' Nest\\" seemed to have more action and many more characters, each of whom had an important role in telling this story.  My complaint:  this is it for the series.  I loved all three...encourage others to read all three in the order in which they were written and hope that the Swedish film company that made \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" will ultimately bring the next two to the movies.
030745455X|4.0|Unlike Dragon Tattoo which took quite a while for me to get into, The Girl Who Played With Fire was hard to put down from beginning to end. Lisbeth is intruiging, even when you feel the awkwardness of her lack of social skills. She is unlike any character I have read, it makes you wish you had the intellect and brute force she has, stemming from her barely 5 foot tall frame. I enjoyed this so much more because there were far fewer characters to remember and piece together into the plot.
B00003CXV4|4.0|This movie is a little treacle-y - as the Brits would say - or sickingly sweet as the US says. But I gave it 4 stars as I was stunned at how gorgeous Charlize Theron is in the first half. I just read that this version is a remake of the original film made in 1968 with Sandy Dennis and Anthony Newley. I'll have to watch that - but, boy, Charlize Theron ......
B000654OUG|5.0|Uchida´s Schubert confirms what I believe is true about all great works of art: they resist to random intruder who wants only to pillage the easily obtainable pleasures. For me, her Schubert was not first easy to grasp. Not to be mistaken: the sound is crystalline and full-fledged. Her pianism is indisputable. Her technique spotless. But you don´t get Beethoven-like Schubert of such Wilhelm Kempff. This is rather a Schubert pointing forward, far beyond Chopin and toward Schumann. This is a Schubert to re-listen and meditate over and over. Highly recommended!

This book was worth the $6.00 I paid for it...but not much more. Now, there was considerable amounts of wisdom I took from it, but despite the wonderful wisdom you can take, the approach to the telling was an issue. The writing was very sappy, too heartfelt and too intimate for me to feel comfortable with at times.

0802798225|5.0|Perfect Chemistry is set in a Chicago area high school that brings together two very different groups of teenagers: the richy rich white kids with their houses on the beach and the Latino Blood gang members from a different neighborhood. The two groups rarely mix (and then not without scaring each other) but that's about to change when Alex and golden-girl Brittany are made lab partners thanks to their teachers forced seating chart.<br /><br />It's the worst thing either of them can imagine at first (Alex just knows Brittany is all fluff and no substance and Brittany is sure Alex is going to stab her or shoot her at any moment), but things soon change.<br /><br />Alex is more than just a gang member, more than just the oldest brother trying to do right for his siblings and more than just a really smart guy who can't quite stay out of trouble....And Brittany is more than the popular girl who has an older sister with cerebral palsy and expectations on her from everywhere. Because of all of that (and a certain bet)--and their insane chemistry, Alex and Brittany make this more than the typical bad boy meets good girl story.<br /><br />Perfect Chemistry was told in alternating points-of-view, one chapter was told by Alex and then one by Brittany and so on so you got each of their sides of everything. And Alex's dialogue and chapters included Spanish which only made things feel more real.<br /><br />Both characters having so much depth to them, from Alex's gang activity (and it not being downplayed, passed over or made to be really nice and light) or the storyline involving Brittany's sister really made Brittany and Alex more like people you cared about than book characters you were reading about.<br /><br />I can't say enough about how much I loved this book.<br /><br />Out of all of the books I've read in probably the last few years, this is probably the only one where I've really missed the characters once the book was over. There have been other books where I was truly sorry the book was over and books I've loved, but this is the only one where I can remember missing the characters like I did.<br /><br />So, read this book-for serious.but this is the only one where I can remember missing the characters like I did.

0061537969|5.0|Who could give this book one star? I can't say much more than has already been written about this book.  You already know the book is written by a dog, the pet of a race car driver, but I really have to dissagree with the one star ratings.    It's not the greatest book ever written, but it is filled with some pithy wisdom (from the dog), and it did make me laugh (out loud), think about some things (to myself), and cry a little bit (with my dog).    It might be a little predictable, but it's a fun read and it's hard to put down.
144471032X|5.0|Lots of research shows diets just don't work. They almost all work on people somehow depriving themselves-not a great path to success. So it's a good thing this isn't a diet! Let's call it a method instead, with \\"diet\\" in the book title so it can sell. This is written by a French doctor who researched nutrition a lot. I must admit I just skimmed the book since it is a friend on the diet, not me, but I got a good idea about it. If you want ALL the details...buy the book yourself, eh?    Dr. Dukan's method seems to be to not just to change your eating habits (without changing your eating habits you will NEVER EVER lose weight!) but his method also seems to condition your body differently by modifying its food processes. An initial stage is protein-only for a couple of weeks; protein apparently takes a lot of energy to digest and doesn't add fat. THEN, you can add non-starchy fruits/veggies every other day. Then on to other foods. The down side? Willpower! If you don't have any, YOU ARE GOING TO STAY FAT! Again, without changing your eating habits you will NEVER EVER lose weight! Even exercise or yoga hardly burn any calories at all, less than a candy bar. The Dukan system still means you cannot be stuffing potato chips and other crap into your mouth. But I still say it's not a \\"diet\\" in that at each stage you can still eat (certain) normal foods, and the nutrition behind it makes more sense than South Beach etc. Plus Dukan is very clear that the weight comes off gradually, and explains well that in some phases of his method will yo-yo naturally.    My friend? A few pounds down so far, and pleased as punch. Then again, that friend has the willpower to see it through-do YOU?!?
B003VWC4AI|5.0|Reading this book made me a fan of the author, Sir Ken Robinson, PhD. He's a great story teller and delightfully shares experiences with profound meaning related to how lives are shaped by our passions (what he calls 'the element'). As a life coach I find most people are disconnected from their passions, purpose, and joy. It's never too late to pay attention to what 'lights us up'. I bought a dozen copies to give as gifts. Highly recommended for high schoolers, new graduates, and people considering making meaningful life changes.

0670034711|3.0|Elizabeth Gilbert is a good writer -- she has some funny, self-deprecating lines, and really I could read about pizza in Napoli forever -- but I found so much of this to be self-indulgent -- and almost disingenuous -- that I only finished it in between downloading other books when I got fed up with her.  In Italy, she considers the one word that describes \\"Liz\\" -- later she finds that word (I can't recall it) -- but I had it for her long before that -- her word: \\"ME.\\"  I'm sure there are more than a few of us who wish we'd had the good fortune to be paid to take a year of self discovery in such fabulous places as Rome and Bali -- and who wish we had the ability to travel so freely as Liz Gilbert did and write so well.  But, I hope if I do it someday and write about it -- I'm alternately less whiney and less self-congratulatory.  The men -- from Richard to Felipe -- are just this side of smarmy -- and I hope they are more genuine than they come across in her depictions.   I guess all is well that ends well -- but I am done with reading about it.

B000AADYYO|5.0|\\"Ghost of Perdition\\" - one of the best songs ever recorded.  Worth it just for this one song.  Everything else is just gravy.  Don't need to say anything else, really.
B002RVZV9K|3.0|For someone who has long loved guitars and classic rock, few documentary premises have intrigued me more than It Might Get Loud's - filming three generations of famous guitarists spontaneously chatting/jamming and interspersing their personal stories. Unfortunately, execution does not live up to promise. For starters, many may quibble with the guitarists - Jimmy Page, The Edge, and Jack White -, but they essentially exemplify their generations and have a nice rapport. I would have of course loved to see other favorites included, and it would have been nice to see a pre-Page player, but the choices are hard to fault. The fact that they have very different styles is certainly a plus. I am a major, long-time Page fan and a minor Edge fan, so I was mostly excited on their part. They of course need no introduction; the mere fact that they are here makes it worth watching for fans. I had very little previous exposure to White, and what I knew - the most popular White Stripes singles - left me rather unimpressed. However, this gave me newfound respect for him. I still dislike his vocals and lyrics, but he truly deserves to be in the film not only because he is a noticeably talented guitarist but also because he has great knowledge of and respect for tradition. In addition, he is very humble and clearly grateful to be around the veterans, even if his reserve seems a bit studied and his traditionalism somewhat self-conscious. As for those who still doubt, it is after all very hard to think of another qualifying popular player from the 2000s.     How much one likes the movie depends on expectations. I hoped the majority of it would be the guitarists talking and jamming, but this is far from true. Opening sequences create suspense about their meeting, with each wondering what will happen, but the meeting is a pathetic anticlimax; there is no excitement and hardly even a meeting scene at all. The interactions are undoubtedly absorbing, especially the players' interest in each other's work and the younger guitarists clearly being in awe of Page. However, the interaction is disappointingly low-key; there is almost no fire or magic. Many have mentioned the pivotal scene where The Edge and White watch Page play \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" like awe-stricken schoolboys, and the film is indeed almost worth watching for it alone, but it is the only such moment. The paucity of their playing together is particularly annoying; not even one full song is shown, and many are cut off far too early. These could have at least been given as extras, but that is sadly not the case. Segments of the individual players describing their techniques are more revealing, especially The Edge's.    Viewers wanting other performance footage will also be disappointed, though this does not pretend to be a concert film. The archival footage will be familiar to fans but is generally used well, while footage of the individual musicians is among the highlights. Page fans will be especially thrilled to hear - and in one case see - the master play two new songs.     The real problem is that, since only hard-cores will watch this, the documentary footage taking up such a large part of the film has little or nothing that viewers will not already know. I say this as a Page fan; the case may be otherwise for Edge/White fans, but I doubt it. Director Davis Guggenheim points out in an interview that it is interesting to see the guitarists tell their own story, but the lack of real insights is still highly detrimental. Even so, there are a few charming scenes, notably Page smiling like a star struck teenager and playing air guitar to Link Wray's \\"Rumble.\\"    Some miscellaneous points remain. The sound is strong throughout, which is of course key, and the cinematography is generally good, but many editing decisions are highly questionable. For example, a short perusal of deleted scenes - especially Page demonstrating \\"Kashmir\\" - shows that they are often better than much of what is used. Written or spoken narration would also have been very useful. Lack of a plot is inherent to the film and basically an asset - at least in theory -, but the way the movie jumps from one guitarist to the other without transitions or any real plan is sometimes confusing. Certain things that are unclear to non-hard-cores - e.g., the significance of the White Stripes playing in an old-fashioned hall to an audience of stuck-up, older men and The Edge's reference to a letter that led to U2's formation - would also have been cleared up. As for the animation, some may question it, but I found it mostly effective and notably funny. In contrast, the \\"young Jack\\" gag quickly grows old and has no redeeming worth.    All told, fans of the guitarists must of course watch this, as perhaps should the guitar-obsessed generally, but it is not strong enough to attract others.
0765326353|5.0|If you're undecided about buying this book, do yourself a favour and just buy it because you won't regret it. It's the best new series I've read in over a decade. I was one of the many people who were introduced to Brandon through his continuing work to complete Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time, and I found the Gathering Storm to be one of the better novels in the Wheel of Time series. Always looking for a good read I decided have a look at his other efforts and I picked up the first few installments of the Mistborn series. While it was a complex and well written world Brandon crafted I found myself becoming bored by the books. The characters weren't particularly interesting and the world was mostly limited to the capital city.    However the Way of Kings is on a completely different level. The world is complex, the magic system is unique and the story is action packed. The Way of Kings begins a series that showcases Brandon's ability to create complex and original settings while providing us with a world of epic scale and characters who's lives and actions demand that you read on just one chapter more. When the book moves away from a main character I found myself disappointed that I couldn't find out more, that I couldn't instantly find out what happens next for that character. After a period where the book concentrated on Brightlord Dalinar Kholin, a leader of an army at war, I found myself disappointed that the story moved away from the action to continue the story of a young female scholar named Shallan. Yet when the book moved away from Shallan I was so involved in her story I found myself disappointed yet again and hungry for more. You could write an entire book focusing on just one of the main characters and you'd enjoy it from beginning to end.    In short, if your a fan of epic fantasy buy this book.
B00383UJ2U|4.0|The fastest selling debut of 2010 in the UK comes preceded by massive press coverage, a sold out UK tour, support from world famous artists, and a word of mouth hype not experienced since the Arctic Monkeys. Who are Hurts, and why the sudden focus on a duo that borrows the 80's stylized aesthetics? As we discover, this time it all may be justified, for a change.    Singer Theo Hutchcraft and synthesizer guru Adam Anderson met at a club in their native Manchester. Their liking of confined landscapes and the somber sound of European bands is an obvious redundancy that needs to be mentioned if their music is to be understood as a means to escape earlier hardships, and their determination to never go back there. Even though they admit to purposely not having listened to other anyone while composing the record to avoid sounding like other bands, they dug way down in the trunk of British tradition, from Tears for Fears and Depeche Mode to Coldplay and Take That, to add modernity to the production.    They aimed to create multidimensional music, that not only plays well on a stereo or a live show but also in a club or anywhere the listener finds themselves drawn to it. Did they succeed? Yes, in part. Happiness is a a mirror image of the two men's impeccable looks, not devoid of emotional power. In the eleven tracks (twelve if you count hidden Verona) they take us on a ride through the darkest effects love and loss have in the human psyche, but despite the burdensome topics it all plays swiftly, thanks to the polished production and often operatic arrangements.    Opening Silver Lining delivers everything that made 80's music appealing: bombastic keyboards, singalong lyrics, soaring choruses, and singles Wonderful Life and Better than love prolong the experience. Kylie Minogue lends her voice to Devotion (in return to the duo's incredible cover of Confide in me), a melancholic ballad that not for a second becomes hers. Hurts make anything they touch their baby and there isno denying it.     The record plays great, feels great, and sounds even better. Are we talking about a band that transcends barriers and may have universal appeal? At some point yes, but not quite yet. Someone pointed out to me that maybe we are just too cynical to recognize the innocence in the simple lyrics to a ballad, or that maybe the state of pop music has taken us away from the real essence of it. So is it the record's naivete that fails to surpass the mark or our jaded ears that do not allow us to look beyond its facade?    Happiness is not a five-star album by any means, but it has achieved more than it set to be. By flashing back to an era relished by everyone as magical, carefree, it has regressed to the simplicity of the complex; it catapults the saxophone solo, the epic synthesizer arrangement, the power chorus to a new phase that the languid structure of the indie pop song cannot possibly convey.
B002CAWNEM|1.0|The absurdity of this film, the movie trailer gave the whole film away and the trailer is better than the movie.    First of all Beyonce better not quit her day job cause acting is not her thing. Beyonce cannot pull off the wife scorned and the only reason she got this part is because her father is one of the producers.     Beyonce's character Sharon is not rootable at all, she's too damn possessive, \\"Why didn't you call me back,\\" \\"Are you listening to me,\\" \\"Eat something,\\" shut up. The ultimate \\"I thought we had an agreement no female assistants.\\" Her husband Derrick is not in charge of who gets hired to work as a temp, so she shouldn't be blaming him for that. Then when she meets Lisa, Sharon is acting like a bitch with a stick up her ass. When they first met Lisa did nothing to show she was obsessed with Derrick and just making conversation but Sharon just made her insecurities show. Does she not have faith in her husband for him not to go sleeping around.    Derrick being an idiot not telling his wife Lisa came on to him just because Sharon just talked her sister off the ledge. What a pathetic plot device to use to keep him from telling his wife. Then when Sharon finds out and Derrick is telling her he didn't do anything with the woman, Sharon automatically believes Lisa's story and not her own husband. She kicks her husband out of the house for 3 months, where there is no solid proof of him cheating. When she kicked him out did he go out and cheat and be with another woman like some men would do, nope. She's acting crusty for 3 whole months of not talking to him and all for what? How the hell is she kicking him out and she got no damn job, did she pay one bill during those 3 months, no she didn't because she has no income.    Why was Lisa targeting Derrick specifically, there was no reason why she became obsessed with him out of the blue. Like others said they gay assistant or Derrick's best friend could have been behind the whole thing but no they weren't. Somakes no sense at all. The ending is so predictable, girl catfight and the police show up the minute the catfight is finished and her husband shows up right along with the police, what a piece of crap.
B002ZG9846|5.0|Ok, I should start off by saying this is not a movie for kids!  It looks like your typical super hero movie, but there is a lot of of violence and really foul language.  I made the msitake of watching this with my 2 year old nephew and his new favorite saying is \\"Kick Ass!\\"<br /><br />That being said, I have to say I was very surprised by this movie.  I thought it would be stupid fluff with a few funny parts... However it really had a great story line!  It was hilarious and action packed with some great actors to boot.  (Gotta love Nicolas Cage, all his movies are entertaining!)  Since I purchased this it has been watched repeatedly by every memeber of my family and we all love it(includeding the 2 year old, who shouldn't, lol).<br /><br />As far as super hero movies go... I found this one to be more believable than most.  The idea being that normal people decide to take a stand and become super heros to help out others.  And the bad guys are your typical Mob boss and drug lords.  Very real in my opinion... of course it does have soe outlandish scenes, but those just make it fun.<br /><br />My favorite characters have got to be Big Daddy and Hit Girl... there story line is by far the best and most touching.  However, I think there is some controversy behind hit girl, seeing how she is played by a 10 year old little girl and she has the most foul language and the most violence of all.  But, even though some may find this wrong and offensive... personally, I loved it.  She made the movie for me!  Great little actress!<br /><br />The ending was totally awesome with a few great surprises!  And I absolutely loved the very last scene that sets us up for a potential sequel... which I hope gets made becuase I'm hooked!
B00006L90T|4.0|7.6.10-The Carnival of Souls opened with a sort of one on one drag race between the sexes, which led to a serious car accident. The large piano organ set shown was very nice. The set of the carnival was amazing. Mr. Lindon was an annoying, pushy creeper. His excuse was funny. He didn't want to eat alone. You think he would be used to it by now. Mary only accepted his presence because she needed a distraction from the nightmares and images she sees. My favorite scene is when she starts playing carnival music in the church and the souls of the carnival begin to dance. In my opinion music is music regardless of church affiliation or not, but this scene surfaced significant conflict with the priest that was already there.  It is weird how the character is traveling alone when she does not want to be alone. Then I see it is a process Mary goes through in realizing she is dead. Therefore some see her, and some don't. Those she meets, she can tell them nothing about herself. It seems like the priest knew more about the old carnival arena than led to believe. He steered clear of it. This horror film is good in that it comes together in the end to reveal the passage of death and the anxiety of dying alone and being afraid of it.
0786956291|3.0|I am a fan of 4E DnD.  I have played ALL the versions of DnD at one time since 1984, and a still play 3.5E Pathfinder from Paizo.  So this box is a \\"Starter Kit\\" to teach new players a simplified 4E.<br />Well, it is pretty, it invokes nostalgia, the map is cool (i am easily impressed by maps, it saves a ton of work), comes with a solo adventure, a free download for a solo adventure, and a group adventure.  With the basic rules of 4E.  That's it.  You will need more material to do more with this box.  Like level your characters past 2nd level.  It was like a choose your own adventure with dice, on rails.<br /><br />I ran my wife thru the solo stuff (i \\"dm'd it, which isn't necessary, it really is solo), she survived the experience and had fun, despite having one of the worst runs of luck with the dice i have ever seen, and has never played anything like this before.  Video game or otherwise.  Well, she got pretty confused a lot of times, it is still an awful lot to absorb.<br />Also, the boss monster in the download is super cool but...., and the first big monster the characters face in the group adventure doesn't have to go combat but...., be careful or TPK easy.  WAY too tough!  No player who hasn't run anything could run those monsters.  WAY too complicated for an unexperienced DM.  Seriously, i think they are trying to beat into new players the RUNAWAY!!!  that so many of us suck at to the new players.  Well, they already did that in Keep on the Shadowfell.<br /><br />Sooo, if you have someone you want to teach, this is a good intro, but that is it.
0061564893|5.0|Gavin Menzies has done a stellar job of research, detective work, and good writing in this book.  The Chinese discovered the rest of the world long before European explorers and this book documents the dates, names, and places of those discoveries.

0439023513|4.0|Some books are so anticipated and so hyped they cannot help but disappoint. This book felt a little that way for me. I know the Hunger Games is dystopian fiction, and the story was resolved but to me it felt flat. I knew that not everyone would survive, and I must admit I was a little surprised by some who died and some who lived. But overall it left me wanting either something more, or something else. The best way to put it is the book left me vaguely unfulfilled. I could put my finger on it directly, until about three quarters of the way through it was living up to expectations. And it is one of the best books I have read this year. But there is this little nagging when I think about the book and the trilogy. I am sure my opinion on this matter will be in the minority but so be it.<br /><br />As we know from the end of the last book, District 13 was not annihilated as the Capital of Penam would have us believe. A team from district 13 has rescued Katniss from her second trip to the arena of the Hunger Games. But how much can a human body and mind take? Katniss is struggling to keep herself together; she also has plans and motives all her own, no matter how other people want to use her. The resistance's goal is to use her as the Mockingjay, a tool to unite the rebels in the different districts, and a herald that can unite the people in a single cause against the capital and its peacekeepers.<br /><br />The story is written at a good pace. The reader will find that they cannot put the book down. They will addictively read and read, even when they should go to bed, or back to work. You will want to find out what is going to happen next, and what is going to happen to Katniss, Gale, Peeta and the others we have come to care about in the first two books. You cannot help but appreciate the characters and watch as they grow and change through the books. Even though the end of the book left me feeling a little off, this is a great book in a great series. If you have not read the trilogy, do!do!
0802473156|4.0|I read this book a while back, I think i was engaged at the time... and I will say I truly think it helped prepare me for marriage and improve my relationship with my (now) hubby. But whether youre dating, engaged or married this is deifnitely worth reading... it will only help your relationship! The concepts are easy to understand... Though the author seemed a little cheesy and elementary to me at times, his points are all valid. It helped me realize that I should appreciate the things my hubby was doing for me (even if they didnt seem like that big of a deal) because thats how he was expressing his love for me. I never really thought about people showing their love different ways, but after reading this, i think i understand him a whole lot more!
0061537969|2.0|First off, how can this be compared to Marley & Me?  That was a wonderful book with depth and no redundancy.  TAORINR was touted to me as being a wonderful book.  I did finish it because I wanted to make sure I didn't miss something that would have redeemed it which didn't happen.  Got book from library for which am grateful.  I am left so frustrated and mad.  Yes, the characters were very one-dimensional and I, too, skimmed over pages that were just too tedious to be borne.  First shock was when he hit the dog after it had been locked in house w/o food or water to speak of for 3 days!  Wow, not a nice guy.  And where was all the remarked upon \\"control\\" Denny had then?      SPOILER: Then his wife is disenigrating and they go on like everything's normal!  Amazing!  The racing parts didn't bother me, found them interesting and learned something BUT, was so ticked off that Denny just kept getting slammed with one thing after another and couldn't seem to fight back effectively IMO.  When the teenage girl recanted I wanted to scream.  How lovely of her, but what about being brought to account for her actions? And the grandparents from that hot place, where was there any just paybacks for them? Enzo got the only one I could tell.  The ending was sad, it's always sad when a dog dies.  I love dogs, cats, horses, birds, you name it but I felt so cheated that any closure of real substance was lacking.  What about Zoe & he talking when they met the father and \\"son\\".  Boy, hate to be left hanging like that.  Enzo deserved more & so did this reader.

B00009YOQW|5.0|I was first exposed to this drum at a toy store, where the store manager demonstrated the various sounds that this little toy makes.  Soon, I was actively reading reviews and decided to take a chance - which turned out to be a huge hit (no pun intended)!  My nephew grabbed the drumstick and began playing for just about the whole weekend.  The great part about this drum is the different sounds it makes - so it's both enjoyable for him and us!  He really enjoys this drum and it was sturdy enough to handle this future percussionist's forceful tapping.  I don't normally write reviews but was so pleased with this purchase that I had to share.

B003L20IDS|5.0|Imagine Yoda in the driver seat of Speed Racer's car, three-toed foot crushing the gas pedal to the floor as he skillfully navigates what amounts to being a Tron maze filled with nostalgic Nintendo video game sound effects.  Window down, left elbow catching a breeze, he's driving with his left knee and having the epic lightsaber battle from Episode III with shotgun riding Darth Sidious while glancing back and forth at the road.  Meanwhile, assorted characters from Mortal Kombat are piled in the backseat like a clown car, fighting alongside an enraged Bruce Leroy from The Last Dragon after he has taken on a final Master level golden glow.  Together, they pummel Mario into submission, tag-teaming him until his bloody carcass excretes golden coins that synchronize perfectly with a bass heavy indie rock produced by Beck (sounds like Leatherface helped with a rusty chainsaw) that is blaring from speakers at jet engine decibels.  That's what I took from Scott Pilgrim vs. The World.  If Comic-Con and Dragon-Con had an omnipotent love child, this movie would have been delivered by all three magi; so, it is quite fitting that the premier was rightfully gifted to attendees of the 2010 Comic-Con.<br /><br />I honestly can't say how much I appreciate this movie.  There are a ton of pop-culture references that any fan of video games, comic books, or graphic novels will thoroughly appreciate.  Seeing as how Scott Pilgrim (Cera), a bassist for aspiring house band Sex Bob-omb, must fight his way through 7 evil exes to date his punkish dream girl Ramona Flowers (Mary Winstead), it comes as no surprise that the action is nearly non-stop, and drowns out the underlying, underdeveloped love triangle about which Pilgrim incessantly whines.  Fighting the exes in a world comparable to a punk rocker's acid trip, Cera and his combatants are accompanied by brilliant usage of onomatopoeia so familiar to comic book fans.  This is not the \\"POW!\\" and \\"BIFF!\\" of your father's Batman.  I'm sure this will become a cult hit, and with each successive viewing there will be more to appreciate.<br /><br />It is my honest belief that this movie would have been a massive success, and would have spread like word-of-mouth wildfire, if it hadn't already been DOA at the box office morgue the minute Michael Cera was cast as lead.  Despite the appearances from Chris Evans, Thomas Jane, and Clifton Collins, the overly feminine, indecisive, mumbling angst of a pseudo-teen still manages top billing, even though Cera's stylings are unequivocally unappealing to most.  Grow a spine already!  Beyond typecast, he's run completely out of steam; maybe type-gassed is a better description.  Only Thomas Sangster grates my nerves more as an actor, and I'm pretty much protesting all of their movies until I find out from a reliable source that the sum is greater than the parts (I reserve the right to contradict myself if either ends up as a supporting actor in a Hostel or Saw sequel).  Having said that, I couldn't be more pleased with the outcome of the film.<br /><br />Despite the fact that going in, all viewers were aware of 7 exes, at no time does it feel like a countdown.  There are distractions aplenty, with health bars, social references, enemies exploding into coins, incredibly well done special effects, and hilarious quips from Scott's gay roommate Kieran Culkin - who fills some of the void left by the two vacuous and uncharismatic leads.  Perfected as comic books come to life, the action/fights are outstanding.  The screenplay by Michael Bacall and Edgar Wright is borderline genius, and except for the sometimes lame dialogue - hard to blame them considering the source material and the actors' styles - there isn't a boring moment.  Additional credit goes to Wright for taking on the direction of this film as well.<br /><br />Before this film, I would have thought it impossible to headline a movie with Cera - who is still riding the lottery wave from Superbad - without his mannerisms ruining everything.  Instead, this endearing mash-up is a perfectly delivered display of American youth zeitgeist, a palatable romcom masked by life inside Street Fighter II on Super Nintendo.  Kudos to all involved.<br /><br />Jason Elinad, this endearing mash-up is a perfectly delivered display of American youth zeitgeist, a palatable romcom masked by life inside Street Fighter II on Super Nintendo.

0374158460|1.0|Negative reviews get no love on Amazon, but, having been thoroughly taken in by the glowing reviews in the NYT, Time, the Economist, etc., I feel compelled to add a voice of dissent and caution.    I read and enjoyed The Corrections, so was looking forward to seeing what Franzen had been up to for the past 10 years. What he's been up to is, essentially, rewriting The Corrections, but extracting all the humor that leavened the misanthropic bleakness of his vision in the earlier work. Once again we're presented with an outwardly \\"perfect\\" nuclear Midwestern family that secretly consists of neurotic hysterics with low self-esteem who ultimately find themselves mired in infidelity and morally dubious business dealings. Once again the focus is on generational conflict, and the \\"sins of the fathers\\" revisited in the lives of the children.    Besides the lack of originality, the problem, in essence, is this time out I don't believe a single, solitary word of it. I don't believe in liberal middle-class parents who'd let their teenage son move in with their obnoxious Republican neighbors. I don't believe in a talented college athlete who'd let herself be hoodwinked for years by a ditzy, obsessive fan. I don't believe in a committed environmentalist who'd sign off on strip mining vast tracts of virgin forest in the name of reclaiming those tracts many years afterwards for a single-species preserve. I don't believe in a 19-year-old arms dealer making procurement purchases in Paraguay. I don't believe in a couple who remain married, but utterly incommunicado, for 6 years. I don't believe in a 47-year-old man with no religious convictions who is trying beer for the very first time, and is prone to bursting into tears on the least provocation. And that's just for starters.    Worse, the dialogue this time out is actually painful to read in its patent artificiality. I defy anyone to point to a passage in this book and seriously maintain that this is how parents, children or loversactually talk to one another, in 2010 or ever. It's as stilted and laden with portentousness as soap opera dialogue. In a plot-driven page-turner in the Grisham mode, this wouldn't be a fatal flaw, but Freedom, with its political and social preoccupations, is a novel that wants to be taken be seriously, and that's simply not possible when the characters speak in an uninterrupted steam of cliche.    The very worst bit, however, is Patty's 200-page \\"autobiography\\" which purports to be her life story told in her own voice, but is, in fact, completely indistinguishable from the authorial voice used in the rest of the novel. That this \\"autobiography\\" is later part of significant -- and, again, wholly unbelievable -- plot twist compounds this reader's dismay.    A last problem is the characterization in the novel. One-dimensional caricatures abound, from Patty's Hippie-dippy sister Abigail to Walter's starry-eyed, buxom assistant Lalith to Joey's shallow, glamour-puss love-interest Jenna to the shrill Fundamentalist kook who plays a significant role in the final section of the novel. The main characters -- Walter, Patty, Richard, and Joey -- are more developed, but scarcely more believable. Walter's character, for instance, does a 180 -- starting as a preternaturally patient, kind, dutiful son and husband, and becoming an erratic, impatient, unhinged hothead. The problem is not so much the change in personality -- people do change over time -- but the fact that the reader isn't privy to what drives or motivates the change. We see the college-age milquetoast and the middle-aged fanatic, but no steps in between.    It gives me no particular pleasure to trash this novel. Franzen is to be commended for attempting something ambitious in a Tolstoyan mode (Tolstoy is, in fact, referenced directly and indirectly throughout the novel) -- to give an American picture of \\"how we live now.\\" But, for me, unfortunately, his effort here falls completely flat, and I can't possibly recommend it to anyone.

B002QW7ALM|5.0|I saw this through netflix and was surprised when I saw that critics gave this negative reviews. This was one of the most scariest, surprising, and unique sci fi films I'd ever seen. The ending shocked the hell out of me and it was confusing at times but I still loved it. It's the kind of film where you will watch it again and again and see little clues as to what happened.<br /><br />The story begins when you see Ben Foster and Dennis Quaid's characters wake up from their hyper sleep induced for the long space flight and both have acute memory loss when they awake which is a side affect. You don't know what is really happening most of the film but I didn't find it slow because of flashbacks from the survivors. The director did a good job of making sure you were engaged and waiting to see what will happen next. As Foster leaves the perimeter of the ship, he comes across dead bodies and humanoid looking monsters that extremely strong, ugly and are also cannibals. The whole movie is about him figuring out who he is, where he is and what the hell is going on. Did I mention the monsters? Anyway, there are also a few other survivors on board and they journey across the other side of the massive spacecraft to reset the generator that Foster figures out needs to be reset before the ship loses all power and they all die (Foster remembers being a machinist of some sort). As the film progresses, it begins to unfold what their mission was, where the monsters came from and the very end shows what happened to the ship and yes I was shocked when it all unfolded. I've never seen a sci fi story like this one. I'm not sure everyone will even get it until a second viewing. In that respect this is worth buying because you need to watch it more than once. I recommend this movie to any sci fi lover who also doesn't mind some gore. It was brillant.
0375704027|4.0|Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami is a novel about a boy in time right after high school to his twenty years old. I want to categorize this book as the second coming of age genre because many characters literally turn to real independent adults in the end. The story begins with the main character, Toro Watanabe, but he meets people around him and tells about their personal stories. Furthermore, the progress of the novel depends on more his people's stories than Watanabe. Also all the people around him are twenty years old, expect Reiko. In other words, through the book, Murakami might want to tell about Japanese young people.  The story begins with introducing Kizuki's death. Naoko and Watanabe have the same bond that Kizuki's death in high school gave them sadness. Both left their home town for their colleges in Tokyo to relieve the bad memories. Watanabe loves her, but she cannot get over his boyfriend's suicidal, even though she has sex with Watanabe. She chooses a mental hospital; that is, she makes a wall by herself to block society.  In the book, Murakami describes many different young Japanese people. For example, Storm Trooper and Nagasawa are very different, but they can be mirrors of Japanese society. Storm Trooper gets up early in the morning and does exercise every single day with the same music. He is neat and clean, and Watanabe makes jokes about him many times. But Storm Trooper's life pattern is very similar to the imagination when people think of Japanese people: neat, clean, and diligent for success. In fact, many Japanese men in good companies do exercise together with music in the morning, but it might be a very weird look for westerners.  On the other hand, Nagasawa has a very different personality. He is a student of one of top universities in Japan seeking for a bright future, unlike Storm Trooper, Murakami focuses on Nagasawa's wanton life. Nagasawa spends money to drink, hangs around to find girls for sex, even though he has a girl friend, Hatsume. She looks patient to her boyfriend's aimless sex with nameless girls, furthermore, she has hope that Nagasawa will stop that and come get her to ask marry. The couple is like exactly high class people in Japan: men to success and women to be patient. But she is ignored by her successful boyfriend and chooses suicidal.  The interesting things in the book are that suicidal and sex. They are the main issues for the characters and these things show over and over. Death and sex can be represented as winter and spring. The kids before twenty years old are dead that means that the human beings, before their real game in life, choose death; in other words, the flowers have never bloom.  Having sex for the characters sometimes are, on the hand, they seek a true love, on the other hand, they do because their physical desire. That is because of their age. The desire for offering for the age from18 to 20 years old people that is natural of human body. Most of the characters start to live by themselves, so they can have their own lives. They have to choose for their lives, to meet people, and to become selected by people. The first thing in independent life of human being is mating, having offering and making a new family.  When Watanabe turns to 20 years old, he goes out of a dorm and have real his own apartment, \\"The location was not exactly convenient, but it was a house: an independent house\\" (240). But his spring is not smooth like its character. Spring after cold winter has warm breeze with unexpected wind and harsh rain, like his spring. He gets news from Reiko told that Naoko's suicidal. He wanders here and there meaninglessly for a while. Midori, his friend, wants him to be her boyfriend, but he cannot decide to choose her as his girlfriend because of Naoko, his hoping girl friend. But after he goes through all sufferings, he finds that Midori is a realistic girlfriend. According to him, his spring term is, \\"This was the beginning of one weird spring\\" (243). This is true. Spring is a beginning of a transformation for a new year. Like Watanabe says the world around him on the verge great transformation (236).  Change is not only a new one, but it is also destruction of the old one. If one wants to keep an old one, like Naoko cannot get over her boyfriend's memories and chooses to die to stay with him. But Watanabe turns to the real world and chooses Midori.  I read this book about ten years ago in a Korean translation version. Whenever I went to a book store, I saw this book on a steady book stand. I wondered why Murakami's books appeal to westerners. Also I want to know how different English translation is from Korean's because the Korean version of a book is a thick one volume or two regular volumes. I think the main difference is the size of English words that much smaller than Koreans. Another thing I could notice is that Murakami likes western music and literature so westerners can have a similar code with the Japanese writer. Watanabe and Nagasawa become friends because they love Great Gatsby. Like the two men's friendship, literature can be a good tool to connect strangers easily.  The book seems tedious to readers because Watanabe doesn't have a certain personality of protagonist. He is the best friend of Naoko's boyfriend, Midori's friend, and he goes to a so-so university, isn't interested in a riot, and follows Nagasawa's choices. Watanabe describes his friends and their lives more than his own family and personal history. That is, the book is not only about Watanabe but is about his people. Because of that, the book looks unorganized. A reader meets as Watanabe meets people randomly, not he makes events as he needs. This is one of unique Japanese cultures: be polite and lower one's head to another. Also they regard a big community as himself; they act same so they feel safe in society, not like westerners argue with each other for a tiny different opinion. This can be shown as Asian culture's beauty, meditation,but inside the quiet tolerance, the main character's life is transformed to adult from boy having people dramatic changes. It looks like the main character doesn't do anything in his life, but he adopts his life modifying little by little as people act, so-called making a balance and harmony. This is a big difference between eastern and western society.

034544678X|5.0|For me, this book goes hand in hand with Cesar Millan's Cesar's Way. The author is an applied animal behaviorist and dog trainer. The book brings us an integration of insights from the world of zoology and canids, combined with training insights on how we can manage our own human behaviour to effectively raise well- mannered dogs. This combination is a real winner, and combined with lucid writing and dramatic and interesting case studies, it makes this book an fascinating page-turner.
0060853972|4.0|This is some really funny stuff. LOL as the saying goes.  4 stars because:  1 - It is dated. A recurring plot is the transformation of tapes left in a certain car. Young readers will be puzzled  - what exactly is a tape deck and why would it be in a car?  2 - It is VERY obviously a takeoff on Douglas Adams. Nothing wrong with that per se, but anyone who has read Hitchhiker' Guide will realize this was two authors having fun with this writing style.
B000092T6M|5.0|For those of you who are unfamiliar with the history of the British Isles, a little background information might be helpful. The original settlers were the Celts, who arrived from central Europe, principally Austria. Several centuries later a group of settlers from Saxony in Eastern Germany arrived and eventually took control of the islands. They brought the English language with them and suppressed the Gaelic languages of the Irish, Welsh and Scots.<br />This conflict between the two groups can be seen in the legends of the Celts, beginning with King Arthur and continuing with Robin Hood. Thus,in the film Robin Hood the Sheriff of Nottingham represents the Saxons and Robin Hood represents the earlier Celtic settlers.<br />Finally, to liven things a bit, we have Kevin Costner as the surfer dude from California who hit a big wave and ended up in Sherwood Forest. He represents the third wave of settlers from the new world who are buying castles all over the British Isles and corrupting the English language. If this trend continues, all of the British Isles will become states in the USA.
B003PNHW3W|5.0|I really like trents music and I don't follow much on whats on the radio. I only found this from getting a message about a new soundtrack and did some searching and came across this. I heard the first track and bought the download the next minute. I also found the video for The Space in Between. It caught my eye and I thought it was really good for something I never heard of. I hope to hear more of the music in the future. But for people like me that do not listen to whats played on the radio we made need to go out of our way to hear music that is very good and not the crap we hear about on TV
0060512806|5.0|Only 1152 pages in paperback, yet somehow I finished in less than three weeks, reading mainly at night prior to falling asleep with almost 2 pounds of book knocking me in the cranium.  I slept, not from boredom, but from exhaustion, because I could not put Cryptonomicon down.  Neal Stephenson is an amazing author.  His characters are down-to-earth, human and real, yet his stories are so intelligent and complexly woven that I find myself acknowledging that I must be an idiot. However, like a sherpa guiding you up a death-defying peak, and safely down again, Stephenson manages to ensure that even those of us with inferior intellect are able to follow along, enjoy the trip and feel accomplished once it is through.
B004386KUY|5.0|This is by far the best collaborative effort I've heard from any rock and roll legend!  This is nothing short of amazing...  I wish I could give it 10 stars.  The Greatest Guitar Classics of All Time played by The GREATEST rock and roll guitar virtuoso of our time.  I purchased this album this morning and have listened to it five times.  In a world of less than mediocre music, please give this a listen and remember how rock and roll is supposed to be played.  The cool thing is that it completely embraces the best of today's talented artists too.  This will not disappoint... especially Back in Black with NAS.  Very cool Carlos et. al.  Keep 'em coming!
0618918248|2.0|I found this book oddly comical - there's nothing in the author's arguments that indicate he has done any academic study of religion whatsoever, so I could hardly be surprised that he could not produce credible arguments against it (though I was somewhat taken aback by the harshness of some of it, I will admit). Indeed I don't believe in the childish beliefs he posits as theology either, and feel embarrassed when I hear somebody, other than a child that does.    Could you imagine some ignorant fool arguing that evolution is a farce, because monkeys do not evolve into people? It would only demonstrate that the individual has a third grade education at best in biology, and only the most juvenile and rudimentary understanding of Evolutionary Theory. Likewise, Richard Dawkins argues against a theology that is only believed in by small children and similarly uneducated adults. Apparently his religious education was arrested at youth, and he is spending his lifetime arguing with his five year old self.    His attempts to replace religious belief with scientific inquiry are purely insane - these are not interchangeable, no more so than Genes and Hormones. I don't want scientists who have faith in particle physics (they would ignore further test and observation) no more than I would want priests who test people's religious conviction (think about the Spanish Inquisition for example, it was gruesome). It's an insane suggestion, as could only be suggested by somebody who doesn't understand the difference between science and religion.    In a nutshell, this is book is yet another irrational argument for Scientific Positivism, which is a school of philosophical thought with it's own history of violence, tragedy, suppression, and fallacies. Supplanting religion with science did not work in the past, and it won't work now; it's a classically bankrupt philosophy at best.    I very much enjoyed the Blind Watchmaker, and have been a fan of Richard's lectures, but because of this fundamental short-coming on the part of the author in this subject matter, I cannot recommend this book.     Instead, I would recommend Christian De Duve's book, Life Evolving: Molecules, Mind, and Meaning. This acclaimed scientist was a graduate of a Catholic University, and never felt the challenge of reconciling science and religion. This is somebody who doesn't just write books about on the subject; De Duve is a recipient of the Nobel Prize for his biological research, and a paragon of Evolutionary Theory, having redefined the notion of the pre-biotic world, and forever changed our understanding of cellular biology.     He is immensely more qualified to speak on either subject, and his contribution to Evolutionary Theory is first hand.

I am so glad the mom and daughter saga is told because I had a strong-willed 2-year old daughter (now 17 years old) who did nothing but make my Shopaholic habit worse!  I still find myself coming up with my so-called valid reasoning on why we should go ahead and purchase things for her we know she doesn't need (and usually trying to hide them from dad shhh!).  I can't wait for her to read this one too so she can see how we got where we are today.  I love the Shopaholic series and I think this one is going to be my favorite!  The best part was having it delivered on my Kindle so I didn't have to wait until this afternoon to go to the bookstore.

Linkin park copied other singer's, linkin park was a rock band and now they are an emotional band, their song's stink like crap, they didn't bring out the lyrics of any songs, and they made the music video of The Catalyst really dramatic. If you heard the songs of their album you should feel disappointed at the band that used to play your favorite songs and now they SUCK!. And for the people who want to hear linkin park's new album DON'T! it's just a waste of money and time.

B003YCI1PM|3.0|A Year Without Rain is not good as her last album Kiss and Tell. I'm a little disappointed with this album. I thought Selena would go more on the rock side. I was hoping better from her. People may not agree with me, but it's what I think. I know Selena can do better than this. There is a few good songs on this album. I hope next time she releases an album it's different than this.
B000HT386M|5.0|I am a 20 years old guy and I say that I loved this movie. It's pretty light hearted and the jokes are not really for kids, they involve some boobies and marijuana at some times. And I must say that Kate Beckinsale looks amazing in this movie.
B0035G9ABG|5.0|The album is different than previous Gorillaz work, but they have always been transforming from hip-hop to trip-hop to pop to whatever else. I'd say this one is a bit less 'chill' than their previous work, with more tracks taking on a specific mood. The typical guest artists have been changed around a little, although the new faces all work pretty well. It's not my favorite Gorillaz album, but it certainly isn't bad. The nice deluxe edition digipak was really nice, too.
B003TXKSWK|5.0|John Legend with the Roots<br />Wake Up (2010) Sony<br />Five Stars<br />The current John Legend release is a serious throwback project. It harks back to the days when music with a social message really meant something. Legend has struck pay dirt for sure by collaborating with<br />funk soul band, The Roots. Revived are tracks previously recorded by the likes of \\"Baby Huey\\", Robert Flack, Donny Hathaway , Ernie Hines, Marvin Gaye and reggae artist, Prince Lincoln.  According to press releases, the project was inspired by the election  of Barack Obama as President.<br /><br />The major  standout on this Grammy caliber project is the musicianship. The Roots' drummer , \\"?uestlove\\" is the time keeper through and through.  Canadian recording artist , Melanie Fiona and Common take a guest spots on the title track. Vocally,  that track is nowhere near what Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes  (with Teddy Pendergrass) did with it. But, it is impressive.  Rather than rely on pre-canned tracks or annoying auto tune misuse , this is a live collection of recorded sessions. True voice and true music is presented without meaningless fluff, silly catch phrases or bling, bling references.

My only consolation is that I was 16 and was, obviously, not the driver for the night, so it was somebody else's bad decision to go home. A driver's license is a great thing.<br /><br />\\"Hands all Over\\" is wall to wall muscular rocky pop with thoughtful lyrics and groovy melodies that go down easier than lemonade on a sticky summer afternoon.<br /><br />The moody lead single \\"Misery,\\" with its lyrics and melody in wedded bliss, enters the head and simply will not leave. It is far from the only such track on the CD.<br /><br />\\"Give a Little More\\" sparkles and shimmers with Adam Levine's smooth, soulful crooning (including vocal flourishes that bring Michael Jackson to mind) and frenetic, dance floor-ready energy, while the yearning ballad \\"Never Gonna Leave This Bed\\" is likely to burn up both radio playlists and the hearts of (mostly female) listeners.<br /><br />\\"I Can't Lie\\" is immaculately arranged and produced with a pop-savvy fusion of doo-wop and indie rock flavorings, while the title track is an intriguing lesson in contrast - icy in texture and arrangement, with hard guitars and pronounced drums, but stark and vulnerable in its lyrics. \\"Out of Goodbyes\\" with Lady Antebellum is a saddening slow-burn.<br /><br />\\"Runaway\\" pulses and seethes under the weight of its nervous energy as Levine sings of the pain of being deserted by his love without an explanation (\\"But I can't tell you if you run away, runaway\\"), and the forceful, idiosyncratic, downright infectious \\"Get Back in My Life\\" would sound particularly well among the tunes on 2002's \\"Songs About Jane.\\"<br /><br />There are so many strong moments here that it is difficult to pinpoint particular highlights. This is not the kind of album to spin before bedtime. One of these catchy melodies is bound to induce insomnia.<br /><br />The deluxe edition extra tracks are worthwhile. \\"Last Chance\\" is a slow-burning rumination on tactile pleasures - it would have made an excellent B-side in the days of CD singles. The slightly overproduced but remarkably impassioned \\"No Curtain Call\\" is just as strong.<br /><br />The acoustic renditions are so breathy, organic and well-wrought (especially \\"Never Gonna Leave This Bed\\") that a whole disc of these would have been welcome, and their live recording of Alicia Keys' \\"If I Ain't Got You\\" pays the R&B songstress a great compliment with its sincere, soul-searching approach that emphasizes the poetic brilliance of her lyrics.<br /><br />Against all odds in 2010, Maroon 5 are a perfectly solid group of musicians who can hit the Top 40 and fill major concert halls without selling out. \\"Hands all Over\\" was clearly labored over, and it is worth your time and money.cellent B-side in the days of CD singles.

0307454541|1.0|I bought the trilogy of books because I knew two other people who had the books.  It looked like a cool title and the description on the back of the first book looked like I would like them.<br /><br />I can't even put into words how slow and tedious this book way.  Here are some of my thoughts.<br /><br />1.  The name of this book was changed from, Men Who Hate Women.  Too bad they didn't leave that the name because that really does describe what's in the book.  But of course that wouldn't get as many buyers now would it?  Nice little trick to sell more books.<br /><br />2.  You must really commit to read the book from the very beginning because you've got to get almost half way through the book before the story really begins!<br /><br />3.  It seems to me that it's likely that this first book is so horribly tedious because it's being used as a set up for the other two books.  I'm only guessing here because I just can't imagine that the author left this book like this for any other reason.  Of course he died, so it's possible that that's the reason why the book couldn't be reworked.<br /><br />Who know why this book is so badly done.  I certianly will never buy another set of books becuase it seems \\"Popular\\".

It picked up right where the first let off and continued in quick fire action all the way through. This time through we got to know more of the contestants in the games and I found myself caring more for all of them. Great writer, great book, wonderful read.
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|Being more of a romantic comedy type, I wasn't thrilled when a friend suggested we see IM2 and I sure am not a fan of Gwyneth Paltrow. But I was pleasantly surprised, to make an understatement. Now this is coming from someone who hasn't seen the original IM, but I needed little to be explained to me, it was pretty action-packed (i.e. I didn't fall asleep), there was plenty of humor (bonus points from me), and I thought Ms. Paltrow was REALLY good in her role as Pepper. That surprised me quite a bit. I definitely recommend people to see IM2, especially if you've seen the first. I saw a couple people that were disappointed in the sequel, well, I don't know what you were expecting. I watched the first IM after I saw the second, and I definitely thought the second IM was better. But everyone has a right to their opinion and this is mine.
B000WQWPKA|2.0|I originally had it on dvd. eventhough I`m not in love with this movie, I still thought it would be a good addition to my blu ray upgrades. man I could very well stick with my dvd copy. I watch my movies on 140 inch HD projector, and compared to my other blu rays, this one is not much of an upgrade. dont get me wrong, it definitely looks better than dvd. but still not as crisp as I expected. there`s an overall softness to the picture. maybe it would look razor sharp on 42 inch tv. but at the screen I`m looking at, It`s unnaturally soft. some would blame it to the fact that the movie was shot 14 years ago, but I have other old movies which look exceptionally good. like The Rock, Braveheart, 2001, speed. I would recommend it for entertainment walue, but if you are looking for a demo picture  material, look elsewhere. get some other  movies with equal mayhem and destruction. like 2012. which looks extremely crisp
0618918248|2.0|I've just finished reading \\"the god delusion\\" by richard dawkins, and I feel compelled to write a short review of the book - not a review of the reviews. I rated his book with only two stars:  one star for getting it published and one star for his courage to come out of the christian closet and attempt to debunk the age old delusion that someone up in the sky is watching us.<br /><br />First of all, there are too many words in the book clouding over Dawkins's essential belief that it is absolute silliness to believe in a human-like entity that created and sustains us.  Secondly, if a writer truly wants to convey a message to the reader, the writer must be clear and concise; his book is anything but...(this is were i took off three points.) The sentence and paragraph structure made me feel like i was a fossil hunter, sifting through hundreds of pounds of soil for some truly worthwhile evidence (explanation) to support his beliefs.  It was exhausting and, in the end, I came away without any new ideas or information as to why religion still exists.  On the plus side, however, he was able to convey one of the most important steps toward breaking through the god myth i.e., that believing in any god is a result of early childhood indoctrination, and that we would all do very well to dispense with it.  I couldn't agree more.
0374158460|2.0|Where to start with this book?  Well, let's start with the story.  It's long and rambling. If you're seeking some insight into relationships, family, or life--don't look here. This is a 600-plus cliche. Most of the territory covered in the plot will be familiar to any person who was of college age in the '70's, especially if you were familiar with jocks, nerds, and wannabes. In short, people that you would soon forget. What I find most annoying, however, are the desperately unlikable characters who inhabit almost every page.  They're completely two-dimensional despite the space of more than 600 pages to expand.  Mr. Franzen, who broke novelistic ground with \\"The Corrections\\" nine years ago, is especially lacking in dialog here.  It sounds stiff, boring and unbelievable. And there is loads of dialog! As if to make up for this, the story is seemingly told by a \\"biographer\\" who assures us, from time to time, that the dialog is real. Nine years is a rather long time between novels. I started this novel (before Big O blessed it with her Book Club nod) with great expectations--what a disappointment!
B003DKJ5ZU|5.0|Great movie, was fortunate enough to see it as part of a Disney Passholder offer.  My 4 year old loved it as well.
B001PPLJIQ|4.0|I had read the book years ago and couldn't get over a feeling of unsatisfactoriness then.It was a first love story yoked to the subject of the post-war generation's reaction to the Holocaust.It reads like a finely worked legal document(Shlink had worked as a judge).It depicts a perpetrator,Hannah,more implicated by her illiteracy than her evil.She loves being read to by Michael Berg,she loves the stories,she does not admit she is illiterate to him. These two people somehow connect love-making to reading.She wants to be read to from all the works of literature, mainly German literature with a smattering of Russian and Greek(certainly not DHL!).There is also a 21 year age gap-illicit in our culture-maybe not so in Germany.She leaves 15 year old Michael because of this sense of shame, as well as refusing a promotion at work as a conductor on the buses due to her illiteracy.     In the Nazi period she worked as a female guard in a concentration camp.In the present(the 50s) she has been indicted in a war crimes trial, when she was responsible for not letting Jews escape from a burning church.She is too ashamed to admit her illiteracy in court and is implicated as guilty in an action against the Jews.I was taken with Winslet's well-scrubbed performance.David Kross was superb as the young man lover,who as a law student years later, becomes aware of the truth, but can't admit it without showing to the legal team he had a relationship with her.Ralph Fiennes is too wooden as the older narrator but serviceable.The cinematography is excellent(Deakins),and recreated the look and feel of post-war Germany.I think the film would have been done better as a German-made film with English subtitles,German actors.As a German actor and English actress seem wrong(tho' Winslet's accent's ok).     We see no images of the holocaust and we are far removed from it,only calling up an incident in which Winslet is involved.The theme is of guilt by association:uncles,fathers,mothers,grandparents.The people the next generation came from, and could the younger generation have done things differently? What would they have done as Hannah asks the judge.The film is worthy and better than most others,but there's a hollowness at it's heart that left me cold. Could this woman love like she did and be more ashamed of her admission to illiteracy than her obedience to acts of evil? Evil is evil however you paint it.The clever lawyer has made an act of atonement on behalf of Germans who became implicated by the heinous acts of the Nazis by being there.Berg sends her tapes of books she's heard and loved,he does this to expiate a pettiness:he does not reveal until they are much older, who is sending them and his refusal to acknowledge her at the time of the trial, and in a more human way of touch,when they meet again.

1449389627|5.0|I cannot believe how much insight and how many examples are in this book. I cannot imagine how much research went into writing this. Berkun's style is equally informative, personable, and engaging. This is the only book I've ever read on innovation and it makes me want to read more. Just a pleasure.
0385339607|5.0|Other books complained that the characters lacked the emotions and depth of his previous characters, and I think they were measuring the characters against this book, which I listened to as an audiobook, which is well done.    As with most of his books, this one is not about how beautiful, desirable, and all-important women are, but he does throw in a romantic interest; more importantly the book is meant to offer insight and be an inspiration to budding lawyers, playing out their inevitable fantasies in grand style; but since budding lawyers are too busy to even think about the story even if they heard it, it may be best served as grandparent-reading to those still in their formative years- if you can imagine a grandparent reading a lawyer novel to a kid... but then we must define kid and formative years...
B003TML0VO|3.0|Anyone who would question Carlos Santana's reputation as one of the world's most accomplished and admired musicians is clearly delirious. Mr. Santana's talent is both prodigious and beyond reproach. However, it is impossible to listen to his latest release and not feel a twinge of sadness that the amazing back from the ashes renaissance he enjoyed with the release of the multi-platinum Supernatural in 1999 has morphed over the last decade into a largely formulaic and unremarkable cd of rock nostalgia.    What does it say about the scruples of the music industry that even a giant such as Santana is considered less than bankable unless working neatly within the lines of the classic rock marketing playbook. In the absense of new material fill and fill with guest-star laden  covers - a tired and vastly overused approach that no matter how meticulous and expertly delivered, leaves the material lacking an obvious rationale for a do-over.     Unfortunately, these songs have been part of the Boomer Soundtrack for so long that there's really nothing new to say - no matter how loudly Santana wants to say it.

It is a good read and in some parts can be very gripping, however i was dissapointed that Conrad really didn't develop any of her story lines that she had been building up so much in the book. To really find out how the story finishes you need the second book, and so far i haven't been anxious to buy it like i was the first one, but hopefully when i do get to read the second one i won't be as dissapointed.

0156034026|5.0|In The Reluctant Fundamentalist, Mohsin Hamid delves into the attitudes and prejudices unleashed after September 11, 2001 and their results.  As Changez, a Pakistani in Pakistan, tells his story of his time in America before and after September 11th to an uncomfortable American, his person experience demonstrates the changes life circumstances and tradegies can bring to one's life.  It also demonstrates that the problems one faces don't disappear in the face of tragedy.  As the reader sympathizes with Changez's job troubles, relationship issues, identity crisis, and longing for his home country questions arise about his intentions creating a sense of unease and doubt because Changez is truly likeable.  Hamid weaves a tale that will draw the reader into the story, create uncomfortable moments of recognition, and garner a greater understanding that at the end of the day people have more in common than not.  Through it all, The Reluctant Fundamentalist is written in a fashion that will leave the reader wanting to discuss it with someone who has also read it.
1408805766|2.0|After ALL the hype over this book, and movie, I couldn't wait to read it.  Well, I made it through about halfway and moved on to something more interesting.  Most of my boredom came from too much \\"introspection\\" and the search for SOMETHING grounding in a place where you don't speak the language or know anyone. ??  I don't get it, but then I have managed to overcome life's disappointments in a far less dramatic, and profitable (the book) manner. Overall, my sense was that this journey was more about writing a book than anything else.  It was too self-serving for my taste, but each to their own. Btw, my mother-in-law LOVED the book, but she is still looking for her true self. For those still on that journey,you may identify with the author and love the story.
B002N8A14M|3.0|I bought this after reading all the reviews, however I want to warn people against buying it if you intend on using the Nike+ adapter with your Ipod Nano.    Pros:  Looks cool  Armband stays on arm  Ipod stays locked into armband (too well see con)      Cons:  The plastic \\"protective\\" cover does not allow the Ipod Nano Nike+ receiver to plug in.  I had to use a dremel tool to make a little more room along the edges of the dock connector slot to allow for it to fit in.  You would think for it being a \\"running\\" band, they would have thought about this.    The Plastic \\"protective\\" cover also doesnt really lock into place.  The bottom half slides into the top half, and is held on with friction.  While this has not been a problem yet, I can see this loosening up in the future, and really becoming annoying.  But it hasnt happened to me yet, so I didnt knock any points off.    The slot that the clip on the plastic protective cover clips onto the armband is almost a little to \\"perfect fit\\" it is actually quite hard to get the ipod out, even if you want it out.  I have to take the armband off in order to unclip it.  That doesnt really sound like a bad thing, but for whatever reason occasionally I want to remove the ipod while I am running. (maybe to find a song, or something like that, and it is all but impossible)    This is a good product, but it is by no means perfect.  If you are looking to run with Nike+, look for something else.

B003NWS5AO|5.0|OK, I'll get this out up front: I think this is Robert Plant's single best offering. Ever. There, I said it - and I can feel the psychic outpourings from a gazillion Zep fans already.    Of course Plant produced wondrous things in 'that other band'. I'm sure I could select any number of permutations of single Zeppelin, or even post-Zeppelin, tracks and put them together in a compilation that I rate higher than I do this. But, no previous, non-compilation, offering satisfies me in quite the way Band of Joy does. Perhaps that simply reflects the 30 plus years I've put on post the untimely demise of what to me was the unparalleled rock band. As one other reviewer has said: there was Zeppelin and then there was everyone else.     So what makes Band of Joy so pleasurable for me? It's a long list. For starters and in no particular order:    Track selection: I like the way Plant has delved into the archives and brought to us a selection of tunes that range from foot-stomping to dark and brooding. I can't fault it. He's introduced me to stuff I would not otherwise have heard and that means that I will probably go back to the source for some of it to hear how they have been reinterpreted. So, he's honouring us as listeners and those who have laid the way before him.    Plant's voice: Of course his has always been one of the great distinctive rock voices. At 62 though we can't expect the wail of the Immigrant Song. On this album his voice ranges from playful to introspective and at all times he sounds completely in control of it. He does give us the occasional peek back to signature notes from his career but this is a wonderfully assured mature voice. He seems an artist who has absolutely nothing left to prove and is revelling in the artistic freedom that gives him.    Musicianship: With the exception of Buddy Miller, I was not aware of any of the other instrumentalists on this album. Of course, RP has worked with the best in his time. These guys all live up to the standardsone would expect. Plant's own comments sum them up: \\"The musicianship of these guys is almost frightening, singing with them, I'm just sliding down the rigging with a knife in my teeth, trying to make off with a few experiences. Sometimes I think I should just be helping out in catering.\\"     Patty Griffin: long one of my favourite singer-songwriters Griffin brings an other worldliness to Band of Joy. Make no mistake, this is not an album of duets. Rather she adds a depth, complexity and richness to the sound that is almost instrumental. Having heard it I struggle to imagine the album without it.     I'm hard pressed to single out favourites from this album. There's certainly no tracks that on the umpteenth listening I'm hitting the skip track button on. If pushed I would pick 'Central Two-O-Nine'; 'Silver Rider'; 'Falling in Love Again'; 'The Only Sound That Matters'; 'Monkey'; and 'Harm's Swift Way' but that list might change tomorrow.    I'm fascinated to hear where Plant goes next. I could care less whether Zeppelin reunites - we have a wonderful archival history to draw from. In the liner notes to Band of Joy Plant gives gratitude to David Rawlings and Gillian Welch for kindness and hospitality. A collaboration with that couple would be fascinating.
0374158460|1.0|This tripe is targeted at those self-important, progressive types. It's not so much that Oprah wants to push her eugenic agenda and that her twisted message is wrapped in a veil of 'freedom' which most of her gullible disciples will find palatable, it's just simply that this book is BORING. A pure waste of time. As a propaganda piece, it seems to have all the right ingredients (controversial title/topic, Oprah seal of approval, NYT-backed), but the establishment media machine forgot ONE important thing.... a good story.

0307341577|5.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK!  I actually listened to the audio version because I tend to only \\"read\\" nonfiction.  Having listened to hundreds of audiobooks, I know how a reader can truly make or break text.  The readers (there are three different ones for Libby, Patty, and Ben--as well as another one for a surprise character at the end) all do an incredible job interpreting the prose.  This is one of my Top 10.  I don't know if I would have felt the same reading the book.  I think I still would have liked it, but the readers' expertise really brought the characters to life (Tim Curry, Charles Keating, and Jim Dale are others who do exceptional voice-over work, elevating their books beyond expectations).     I won't go into the plot since other reviewers have already been thorough in that regard.  I loved the characters' flaws and how each voice came through.  Many reviewers point out how dark these characters are, finding them unbelievable.  However, I used to work in a town populated with people just like this, so I know they ARE believable, and many of the situations are (frighteningly) believable, too.  I did have a problem with one of the major plot points toward the end...seemed a little far-fetched, which disappointed me since I didn't feel that way about anything else.  Aside from that small issue, I have raved about this book to anyone who'll listen.  My favorite books are ones that not only tell an interesting story but are also written at a different level than the \\"norm.\\"  For some reason, \\"Dark Places\\" affected me in a way similar to \\"What Came Before He Shot Her\\" (in which Elizabeth George transformed herself from a mystery series writer into a literary writer).     If you read this book, definitely go for the audio download!
B001C08RHA|2.0|The movie had lots of pretty visuals. And that's about it. A five-year old child could write a more imaginative scenario & dialogues. Spoiler: The line \\"give me an American cheeseburger\\" by Stark upon his return from captivity in Afghanistan, after which he is shown eating Burger King, seemed really cheap to me. It demonstrates what the movie is all about. If you are oblivious to propaganda and advertising, then you may enjoy this movie. Just my $0.02.<br /><br />PS: I did read the comic book as a kid and was a fan, whis is why I was disappointed with the cheap pseudo-patriotic \\"American cheeseburger\\" lines, the cliche Afghan terrorist stereotypes, and the rest of the shallow plot. The comic book used to be much more cult and intelligent than that...
B000F9T7E6|1.0|First off I LOVE THIS ALBUM, love it. I bought it on vinyl because I wanted to hear every little nuance of Danger Mouse's killer beats and rhythms and Cee-Lo's beautiful, soulful voice. I was enraged when I received the album and it skipped nearly every song. I cleaned the record, cleaned the needle, no difference. So I figured I just got a bad copy of the record. I love this album so much I bought it AGAIN on vinyl and the damned thing skipped in all the same places. I don't know if they are both from a bad batch or if they are just shite quality, but I DO NOT recommend buying this album on vinyl.
B000N3ST3Y|4.0|Genesis, like many groups, have had a history filled with changes--both in members and sound.  I was most familiar with the main Genesis hits from the 80's--during the height of their popularity.  For a \\"best of\\" collection, I found they made some interesting choices.  Adding one older song (before Phil Collins took over lead vocals) and one after he left made me wonder:  who chose these songs?  Was it the record company adding some lesser known tracks to expose their listeners to the other versions of Genesis?  I enjoy all the songs on the collection.  It just just seems--off a bit.  I think they should have either included all the big hits, or have a bigger range from over the years, but they tried to do both.

It wasn't until after I had worn out \\"Alpha\\" that I realized that Asia had put out an LP from the year before.  (What can I say, I was 12 and there was no internet).  Many people overlook Alpha because they measure it up to the first LP, \\"Asia\\", but since I experienced it the other way around, let me say, Alpha more than stands on its own as a classic.
B003L77GHE|5.0|As I understand it, The Vampire Diaries is supposedly aimed at teenage girls, well I am neither, yet (as far as I am concerned) this series is tied with NCIS as the best program in TV, the BLU-RAY disc's are stunningly well done, the transfers are near perfection, the sound is well balanced and dynamic, the performances are first rate, the stories are great, and constantly go off in directions that are full of surprises, not to mention fun, I look froward to every episode, and can hardly wait until season 2 is out on BLU-RAY, so I don't have to constantly be distracted by the idiotic computer generated blurbs across the bottom of the screen, you know the ones that tell you what you are watching (wow they think were dumb) what's coming up next(gee I can't wait to find out), thanks for telling me, what's coming up next Tuesday, next month, next year, log on to this or that link, tell us how good we are, bla bla bla et infinitum, makes the decision to buy the BLU-RAY a no brainer, the same applies to season 2, it's just as involving and the Blu-Ray discs are just as well done, can't heap enough praise on this series or the BR transfers

I ordered the book without having any particularly high expectations but willing to take a chance. After reading Chapter 2 of the book, my approach to looking at plot and genre changed radically. A script I had been working on but having some trouble with, suddenly came alive. Instead of just another war story, I found that my protagonist was actually on a quest -- like Jason and the Golden Fleece. After chapter 3, I knew exactly what the log line was and even what the poster looked like.  It was the same with each succeeding chapter, each one going to the very heart of the issue presented. I consider this book to be a \\"must have\\" for every screenwriter.[[ASIN:1932907009 Save The Cat! The Last Book on Screenwriting You'll Ever Need]]

B003UYUR10|3.0|Jake Gyllenhaal (and his sister Maggie) are the children of Naomi, as in \\"What About Naomi?\\"<br /><br />If you watched the classic original Electric Company back in the '70s (or when it was briefly revived, or on DVD), you know that this was the signature phrase from the brilliant \\"Love of Chair,\\" a satire of soap operas that was conceived by head writer Paul Dooley. Every installment of this sketch ended with the narrator saying, as the organ music dramatically paused, \\"And...what about Naomi?\\"<br /><br />It was an inside joke. The real Naomi was Children's Television Workshop staffer Naomi Foner, who years later gave birth to the two young stars. What does this have to do with The Prince of Persia? Well, it gives Jake Gyllenhaal a few extra points with me even though this movie somehow falls short of what it could be. He seems like a sincerely good fellow, and even took the time to appear in promos and on talk shows to promote this film, something that some stars who cash huge Disney's paychecks don't bother to do.<br /><br />As a workout video, The Prince of Persia is better than any of those Jane Fonda VHS tapes. Jake earns his abs in scene after scene. It's a shame that the script did not offer him as much of a challenge. We never really get to know, or really care much about, the lead characters. The first 30 minutes is almost solid exposition, overloaded with political business and intrigue, before the fantasy of the magic dagger and the romance of the lovely and independent Princess and Dastan get underway.<br /><br />The two leads seem to have some chemistry but an awful lot of epic furniture gets in their way. I have to wonder how the script must have been before it was meddled with by all the chefs, concerned about the obviously huge budget paying off and making sure the kitchen sink wasn't left out.<br /><br />It's a fine cast with always great performances by Ben Kingsley and Alfred Molina, spectacular production values on a level with DeMille and a fine score by Harry Gregson-Williams.<br /><br />Maybe the summer was too hot here in Florida for me to find the film's setting very appealing. The short documentary included with the DVD (the Blu-Ray also includes a deleted scene and an interactive feature) tells us that the temperatures were over 100 degrees and this discomfort comes across in the film -- though apparently producer Jerry Bruckheimer stayed nice and cool in the studio where he taped his comments with a superimposed background behind him!ybe the summer was too hot here in Florida for me to find the film's setting very appealing.

0312600844|4.0|The first hundred pages were pretty bad in my opinion. I felt like Franzen was trying way too hard to paint a picture we're all very familiar with. He could have setup the characters and the cliches in a few paragraphs. We're all familiar with the types of people depicted and the social issues outlined. That said, I am glad I trusted in Fraznen and continued on even when I thought putting the book down was a better idea. I urge you to read the entire book. I ask you to challenge yourself to do the hard work that's required to understand what is really being said by the author and the lessons outlined that you could use to grow your understanding of our society and each person's role in it.<br /><br />It would be easy to dismiss this book because of it is so modern that it is hard to digest and accept that we live in such times and speak and live in such ways. This book will grow more respected over time as it transitions into more of a historical snapshot of our time and place. This book is Jonathan Franzen quoting Anna Ahkmotova \\"I stand witness to our time and our place.\\" If you are an American reading this book you will feel the need to run and hide and pretend you are not part of this society but time will show that you were wrong.<br /><br />Any reference to Tolstoy is ridiculous and made only because the book is longer than 300 pages and because Franzen references War and Peace a few times. Tolstoy is one author who is not easily copied.<br /><br />Here's a poem that was inspired by the book:<br /><br />Title: Freedom Cost Us Culture<br /><br />Ode to thee my American friends!<br />Never fret over foreign words,<br />Let those laugh at thy self,<br />Let those laugh.<br /><br />Time has come to mature,<br />Fields of folly and freedom,<br />Seeds rooted deep,<br />Let it reign, persistent mist,<br />Our culture growing like Redwoods,<br />Unabated and without permission,<br /><br />Bourgeoisie, put on your tail coats,<br />Woman's corsets and un coup de chapeau,<br />Put away simple philanthropy,<br />That hole is filled with misery,<br />That hole is filled.<br /><br />Time for eyes wide open,<br />to gender, and mental capacity,<br />the secrets out, we're not all equal,<br />equal opportunity misread by choice,<br />understood, time to move on.hole is filled.

0312600844|5.0|I found Freedom to be a novel of how we all live today.  The most striking thing about the story is how Franzen is capable of moving the story along, not with narrative so much, just by placing you in each characters head and letting you listen to their thoughts.  The effect is that you seem to live the book rather than read it.  You will remember this book.       The book is the story of a family and their rock and roll musician friend Richard Katz.  All of the characters are very self absorbed and despite living with each other or being best friends they are completely out of touch.         One thing that I can tell you is that if your looking for a happy, fuzzy story this isn't it.  All of Freedom's characters are very unhappy and the story is all the more depressing for its feeling of sad hopelessness.  These characters are never going to change for the better and if they get what they want its probably not going to make them any happier.       Richard Katz is the best friend of Walter Bergland.  He's a rock and roll singer and song writer who also builds decks, smokes and dips skoal and has no problem attracting women, including Patty Bergland his best friends wife.  Richard has an affair with Patty after snubbing her on several previous occasions and then over the course of some years begins to realize he loves her.       Walter Bergland is a very good man but thats just it, he's too good for his own good.  He seems to have a competitive love/hate relationship with Richard Katz but the whole thing is pointless because it centers around his wife Patty and Richard could care a less about competing.  Even as Walter's wife Patty ignores him and cheats on him Walter remains loyal even as his young assistant falls in love with him.       Patty Bergland is probably the main character in the story.  Patty seems to spend the whole story trying to be loved.  First,her son Joey grows up and she goes off the deep end trying not to lose him to his girlfriend.  She has an affair with Walter's best friend Richard.  And you come to believe she never should have married Walter at all because she doesn't love him, he was just a good man to latch on to.       You wonder why anyone would read such an unhappy story.  This book is like the national enquirer, you don't exactly like the story but it is very compelling, very real and its very familiar.  Some reviews complain that Franzen uses his characters to preach about what he hates, and maybe so but you're going to read each sermon shaking your head in the affirmative and saying amen because he hates what we all loathe about our society.         If you you read one book this year this is the one.  It's the best novel I've read to date but it's not the most comfortable one.  Franzen has his finger on the pulse of our society and we have many many problems that there is no really good answer for.

I had my doubts but seeing that I wasn't completely nuts about this idea and how this helped other people, I saw it was the right choice. For me, personally, this book was therapy and I don't know but it may be the book that has helped me the most out of all books I've read prior during and after my divorce.

Co-Staring the Great John Lithgow. Whom we know can be frightening. Or loveable. In his acting career.  But the trick of this show Is we do like Dexter, We do empathize with him and we feel Oh all kinds of things he can't.  So this really was another 5 star season. If they keep up with these writers this show could be on for another 4 years easy.Each episode Is carefully crafted to have It's own story and his sister plays an Integral part In Dexters \\"Playing at Reality\\" and keeping up his image.  She Is a great actor herself, all the supporting cast Is. Rita Is Great.  Yet the season made you want to see the next episode for what was going to happen next like a compass to North.

B002UXRGM0|5.0|As it should be, the enjoyment factor and quality of this documentary is on par with Planet Earth, A1!  The same company from the BBC produced this series and it SHOWS!  I agree with most reviewers here that David Attenborough breathes life and passion into this documentary and would shy totally away from the U.S. version narrated by Oprah Winfrey!  I saw a little of the U.S. version with Winfrey, at a friends house, and knew right then that I would wait to get the BBC version.  Oprah's dialog is more monotone and not nearly as engaging, as Attenborough's! He is , IMHO, along with Morgan Freeman, the most interesting and colorful narrator out there for documentaries. If you loved watching Planet Earth, you will love LIFE!  It is also well worth purchasing the Blu-ray, if you have the components to watch it on!<br />  FYI...I just ordered \\"Wonders of the Solar System\\" on Blu-ray, just recently released, but have not received it yet!  It is also produced by the BBC and narrated by Brian Cox, who I have never heard (I believe)narrate,  It will be interesting to see how good Cox is at narrating documentaries.  The Blu-ray is still rated by customers at 5 stars, so I am almost sure it will be just as engaging!
0374158460|5.0|I should state, upfront, that I am the target demographic for this novel - 53 years old, born and raised in Chicago, high income, post-graduate education and left-leaning politically. I also should state that I loved \\"The Corrections\\" and waited a long time for \\"Freedom\\" to arrive.    Last Friday night I attended an appearance/book-signing by Jonathan Franzen in Austin, Texas and was blown away by the guy. His brilliance is a sight to behold - every question that was posed to him resulted in a thoughtful, often very funny answer that would never make it in \\"Twitter-land\\" - his thoughts are paragraph length and always on the mark. I don't think he is elitist - but he is one of the smartest people I have ever met and I think he knows this about himself - most often he seems amused by it all - be honest, the adulation would do this to about 99% of us...    This novel then is no surprise - life is complicated, populated by people that are, well, people and they do the things we all do - and plenty of it is negative/mean/self-serving etc. and Franzen captures these people in all their splendid/tortured humanity. It is if the man has taken every thought I have ever had, every discussion, good or bad, I've ever been in and put on paper. Each time I put this book down, having read 50-100 pages in a sitting, I would literally shake my head in disbelief that anyone could so perfectly capture \\"life\\" as I live it and know it.    As I think more, it is my opinion that books come along that can be described as chronicles of certain ages - Tom Wolfe did this with \\"The Bonfire of the Vanities\\" for the 1980's - \\"Freedom\\" accomplishes much the same for the decade 2000-2009.    It is too bad that we are unlikely to see another novel by Franzen for some time. At his appearance in Austin he explained that until he really has something \\"new\\" to say, he won't be publishing another novel, and as he explained this his notion of something new is clearly large - profound really  - the examplehe was if he was hit by a car and ended up in a wheel-chair - perhaps then, he would have a world view sufficiently altered to create something to write about.
B00006D295|5.0|THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW. Few films have earned such an enormous cult-following as this campy classic from 1975. Set to an assortment of electrifying rock numbers and huge power ballads, ROCKY HORROR is an operatic Horror Comedy that is unlike anything else in the cinematic landscape. No stage could have contained this crazed adaptation, and few films since have reached the same level of energy and insanity! Upon being stranded on the side of the road, the newly-engaged Brad and Janet are invited to stay the night in a manic mansion where Rocky is celebrating his first birthday. You see, the diabolical Dr. Frank-N-Furter has just created the perfect man, and everyone is celebrating by putting on an elaborate stage show! To reveal any more would spoil much of the fun, as ROCKY HORROR is simply a spectacle that must been seen to believe. The film puts together a strange and unusual collection of characters, featuring Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick as the straight-laced lovers that are caught in the middle of Dr. Frank-N-Furter's sexual experiments and all of the confused excitement. Tim Curry's transgendered Transylvanian host is as iconic and memorable as Dracula or The Wolf Man, and his ghoulishly over-the-top character has become instantly recognizable in cultures around the globe. Having obviously been influenced by the stage productions of the earlier plays, ROCKY HORROR incorporates many garish costumes and wildly exotic sets that perfectly fit the on-screen absurdity. An astounding 35-years after its initial release, THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW continues to shock and entertain audiences at midnite movie houses spanning the world over, making it the single longest-running theatrical release of all-time, and quite possibly the most enjoyable!<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies
B001AQO3Z6|5.0|Looks like there is not bussiness to do this films in HD. Seems MGM prefer to sell other pictures that sell better than some real masterpieces like Qatsi trilogy. MGM Please relase Koyaniskaatsi in blu-ray! Is a must have.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|This was our daughter's first movie in the theater, so it will forever hold a special spot in our memories.  \\"Cars\\" was our son's first.    I find Pixar's movies to have a lot of heart.  Every production of theirs comes across as a baby who was loved, cared for, nurtured, and intended to live forever.  The rewatch values of these movies are so high that it makes me want to collect them.  I literally mark on our calendars when their new movies are to come out.  I cannot wait for \\"Toy Story 3\\" DVD to be released.    With that said, I think Studio Ghibli remains just that one notch higher than Pixar.  Perhaps it's because it's so old school and I'm biased because I grew up watching \\"Totoro\\".  Nothing beats that!
B003S897UK|5.0|Hadn't heard their stuff until I caught them on The Bob and Tom show.  Took a chance and ordered the CD and could not be happier!
B003V6L94Q|4.0|The Zac Brown Band burst on the scene a couple of years ago, with great songs, musicianship, and outstanding vocal performances.  They bring the best the elements of what we've labeled \\"southern rock\\" (though Gregg Allman is probably right when he says that's like calling something rock rock).  Their song Highway 20 Ride was arguably the greatest country tearjerker since She Stopped Loving Him Today.  Their new CD You Get What You Give continues the trend.  Simply put this is the best country CD I've heard this year.<br /><br />The CD is built on the solid foundation of  drummer Chris Fryar.  .  He brings lessons learned from years on the road with Otiel Burbridge of the Allman Brothers to the party.  Bassist John Hopkins climbs into the pocket and together they give the record a solid rhythm section with the capacity to swing.  Fiddler Jimmy De Martini, organist Coy Bowles and multi-instrumentalist Clay Cook, lay a shifting bed of sonic colors and Zac Brown's vocals are as good as any in country music.  The band's harmonies remind me somewhat of Alabama, though instrumentally the band is much more adventuresome and rocks much harder..<br /><br />The disc features uptempo country (Let It Go), hymns to the road) (I Play The Road), ballads (No Hurry, Quiet Your Mind), heartbreak (Colder Weather) and guitars (Martin).  Jimmy Buffett guests on Knee Deep, a musical trip to the tropics, and who could ask for a better wingman when you're in a bar checking out a lady than Alan Jackson  on As She's Walking Away.<br /><br />This CD is everything that is good about music from the south- Great writing vocals, instrumental performances, and a connection with where working people really live.  The only reason this record doesn't get 5 stars is that as good as the songs are there is no signature song like Highway 20 Ride.  With that caveat, you should run to the store, click on the link, do whatever you need to do to add this to your collection.  Essential country.
0525423842|4.0|This book was enjoyable to read.  The characters were entertaining and you couldn't wait to see what Theo would do next.  I didn't put the book down once I started to read it.
B000F9RB9Y|5.0|The improved sound of Blu Ray, the crisp video, you can't go wrong. This is the best way to see one of Schwarzenegger's earlier films since the big screen! So if you don't have an extra movie theatre hanging around, grab this Blu Ray and a big TV, you're in for a ride.
B0043HA1K0|5.0|Most cover albums are failures from the jump. It's not really the artist's faults, it's more a problem with the fact that most of us consumers just can't let go. We love those classic songs that we grew up with, so we just naturally figure \\"Hey, there's a new version of My Funny Valentine out there, I'm there!\\"<br /><br />Instead what we tend to get is meaningless and pointless versions of songs that have none of what made us treasure them. Whether it's the artist's voice or tempo of the remake, or perhaps it's just a matter of that original song hitting you at the right moment, and becoming embedded in your timeline, it's just not the same. Often it can make you angry to hear a remake of a beloved song and have it just destroy all your positive thoughts.<br /><br />In my entire life, I've only heard three albums that involved covers that I willingly would listen to regularly. UB40's \\"Labour of Love Volume 1\\", The Jeff Healey Band's \\"Cover to Cover\\" and the Bob Marley tribute album called \\"Chant Down Babylon\\"<br /><br />And that's it. When I see an album of covers I tend to steer clear, because the odds are just not in your favor if you're wanting to be entertained.<br /><br />So that's why I was curious when I first heard about the new John Legend album that he did with The Roots called \\"Wake Up!\\". While I've never really been what you'd call a \\"fan\\" of Legend, I've absolutely loved some of his songs.<br /><br />Also, Philly band The Roots are, in my opinion, one of the top 10 bands of all time. OF ALL TIME! They're that good. I'd stack them up against anyone in any genre, and particularly hip hop they're heads and shoulders above everyone else. They're lapping the competition something serious.<br /><br />Their newest album \\"How I Got Over\\" is their best album in years, and easily dominates 99.9% of anything that's come out this year. (I left the .1% because I haven't heard everything, but that's about the percentage chance I give anything of being better).  At this point in their career, you see a release with The Roots on the cover, and you just put your credit card on the counter, and just say \\"Run it.\\"<br /><br />So the two teaming up for a set of classic soul music is a great idea, and the fact that the songs are all socially conscious tracks just makes it even better. That is why I have been geeked out for several months after hearing about \\"Wake Up\\", the newest release by Legend, and his first collaborating with The Roots.<br /><br />When it comes to cover songs though, especially ones like these which are evoking specific memories and social commentary from back in the civil rights era, and the war in Vietnam, you have to have a voice that can carry these tales. Your voice has to not just hit the right notes, but has to be able to invoke the very essence of the song. You're not just singing a song from 40 years ago, for many people you will be attempting to recreate a moment in time. An important moment in our history in which the soul singers of the past stood up, put their name out there and decided to fight for what they believed in, the one way they knew how: with their voice.<br /><br />And in that respects, John Legend does a heck of a job. While I've always liked his singing, on this album I think he truly steps into the spotlight as an artist. His voice is perfect for these songs, and Legend has the proper amount of inflection and balance to his voice, if that makes sense.<br /><br />Listening to this album with your eyes closed, you can almost imagine that Legend was actually back in the 60's singing these for the first time. With the highly accomplished band The Roots backing him up, and with Legend's more than capable vocals, there's virtually nothing to find fault with this. In fact, the only area that I can imagine someone really taking issue, is the additions of Black Thought or Common's rapping on some of the songs. I can imagine there will be the purists who will find that just atrocious that there would be added rap lyrics ontop of what truly are classic songs.<br /><br />And to that, I would suggest that most of those who would not like the rap lyrics on here are also ones who would take offense at their favorite songs being covered in the first place. Meaning, that nothing is going to satisfy them, and that if it wasn't the rap, it'd be something else. However the rap actually adds to these songs, and does not detract. They're not there just for the hell of it, or a \\"Buy the Roots get Black Thought free\\" or something. Black Thought is a top 10 MC, folks. Much like Edward Francis Hutton, when he speaks, you should listen. He's often got a lot to say, and this release is no different.<br /><br />The songs being covered on here are pretty impressive, and while I don't think any of them will replace the original in my heart or mind, they are by far better than most covers out there. I don't think anyone could touch Donny Hathaway's original \\"Little Ghetto Boy\\" or Marvin's \\"Wholy Holy\\", however there are many that Legend is just in a groove. Many of these songs have heavy heavy subject matter, and are songs that you don't simply hear. You listen to it, you close your eyes, you soak it in and absorb it.<br /><br />I find myself listening to him singing \\"I Can't Write Left Handed\\" and try in vain to understand what it would be like, as the song's protagonist sings, to be in a war that I didn't understand. To desperately find someone to write home to my mother and beg her to get a deferment for my brother so he didn't get sent off to war as well. To be at that point that I felt that I would never get home alive, and wanting with all my heart and soul to somehow try to save my brother from a similar fate.<br /><br />It's a heartbreaking situation that Bill Withers just perfectly laid out in his original. While Legend doesn't surpass the original, he is just flat out on fire on this song, and there's really nothing to criticize.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Legend or The Roots, you need to buy this. You need to just not even think about it and just get it. But I really don't need to tell you that, if you are. If you're a fan of those two, you really didn't need any provocation, and you've probably already pre-ordered it, and just wanting to see what someone else thought about it, and whether it was as good as you imagined it would be.<br /><br />It is. For those who perhaps never heard either Legend or The Roots, well my friend, you're in for a treat. This is a perfect introduction to the two, and I guarantee you that once you've heard this, you'll want to find more albums by The Legendary Roots Crew, and the fantastic Mr. Legend.

B00007KWHO|4.0|a much overlooked album by one of the greatest progressive rock bands of all time.....the music here is more classical and jazz oriented then later albums, this was the beginning of the end for the original lineup and guitar player peter banks would soon be replaced by steve howe......
B00364K6YW|5.0|I already owned 2 versions of this miniseries:  the VHS and the original DVD release.  When I saw that it had been updated to enhance color/sound, and that it was less than $20, I just had to have it.  Glad to report that it was worth it.  The picture is sharp and like other reviewers before me have said, I noticed details that I hadn't previously.  And believe me, I have watched this over and over and over and over again...    This repurchase is worth every cent, if only for the wet shirt scene...
B003S897UK|4.0|one of the greatest live bands around.......great to hear even more stuff from the original trio!!!

B0025UHKNS|3.0|I am a moderately high volume runner.  I have been training for ultra marathons, and got my Garmin 405cx watch to help measure the distance of my runs out on the trails.  I use the heart rate monitor as a guide for both exertion and hydration. I have been using the watch about two or three times a month since 2009 to measure distances on new routes, and during races.  I have been satisfied with the performance of the 405cx with a few glaring exceptions.    First, I am very unhappy with the rechargable battery life.  I have used and recorded about 100 runs and races with this watch, and now it will not hold enough charge to operate for more than an hour.  (And yes, I did reboot the thing and loose all my history and data as an attempt to rectifiy the problem.) On my last run, it started beeping \\"low batt\\" after only an hour, and when I stopped it, it said it had 14% battery left, which lasted about another 8 minutes.     Here's my issue.  This watch retails for (when I bought it new) around $400.  To send it back to Garmin for repair, which they send you a reconditioned repleacement, costs $110.  That seems like way too much money for what the performance I got.  $4 per run to save and record data?  Is it really worth it?  I will not be making another purchase or repair until I have heard Garmin address this problem and make some significant improvement.    My other issue is the touch bezel reacting with sweat and rain.  It does both, even after I have turned down the sensativity to low, and lock the bezel.  After I learned to tune out the single beep from the bezel, and listen only for the mile marker beep and the low batt beep, it didn't cause problems other than a minor annoyance.      So if you have the cash to burn, and are aware of the battery and bezel problems, this watch is about the best product in its class on the market.  I have liked the ant+ feature, and downloading data has been easy.  The maps generated can be imported to google and topo maps which isgreat too.
B003YOMNCM|5.0|This CD is simply amazing. Hilary, once again, never ceases to amaze me. The Higdon violin concert is a beautiful piece. It really shows off Hilary's perfect skill, especially the cadenza in the first movement. I've never heard anything like it before...ever. This recording is much better at displaying her dynamic contrasts. In her concerts she has the ability to fill the hall with her sound even over the orchestra or play so quietly that you feel the need to lean in to hear every note. This is the first recording of her that has captured a portion of that. After her release of the Shonberg and Sibelius, Hilary had really stepped up her game. She plays the Tchaikovsky with an entirely different interpretation and with amazing ease. Her approach almost cradles the music like a loving mother. Some sections that are played without much care by most violinists, are really emphasized and phrased properly.    If you are the critique that doesn't generally like Hilary, try this CD. You may find this recording exciting and fresh.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|I was skeptical of this show at first, but after watching a few free episodes online I was hooked!!!!  I pre ordered the complete first season and could not wait to get it so I bought the digital season from Amazon.com to watch until I got the DVDs.  The DVDs are loaded with special features and it seems like the cast/crew have as much fun making the show as I do watching it.

I had a friend who did this video and she this is how she lost her first 20lbs to a great start to her weight loss!!!
0439023513|5.0|This is a great book series. This is the last in the trilogy. It is socially conscious, however extremely violent. It definitely holds the attention of the video game generation.  It is a great series for kids and adults who get board reading. It is a page turner!
0439023513|2.0|I was soooo looking forward to this book only to find the author in a hurry to finish a book rather than finish a story.  I guess Holywood breathing down your neck doesn't help!
006123141X|5.0|Reading a new James Rollins novel after a year's absence is similar to a visit from an old friend who has been away for while. Your friend will always have that same style of voice and mannerisms, but being away has filled him/her with new stories and adventures to tell.<br />Leave it James Rollins to renter the scene in what is perhaps his best novel in 5 years. Yes, many (if not all) of the characters are the same and yes the plot does involve many similar elements from his previous works, but, hey, being familiar with these things is partly what made this novel so good.<br />The other part is the unrelenting and explosive (pun intended) action scenes that Rollins has penned. Nearly ever page in this 500+ page novel was full of action, suspense, and vivid details that made me feel like i was in the middle of a huge new summer blockbuster movie.<br />And then finally add in a story that is incredibly rich in both facts, originality, and intrigue and you pretty much have (as I stated before) one of Rollins's finest books to date.<br />My only complaint (as usual) was that this book ended far too soon. It was really good enough that I could easily have kept entertained with another 300 pages of story.
B0001ZXM54|4.0|For the casual ZZ Top fan, this is basically all you need. Their hits are here.  But, for someone like myself who is more than a casual fan, there are a few good songs missing here.  Every greatest hit compilation will attract someone who is not pleased with the whole song list.  I, for example could do without the Legs(Dance Mix), and Velcro Fly(12\\" Remix). There are 3 songs from Eliminator that would have been great to see here, for example, \\"I Need You Tonight\\", \\"I Got The Six\\", and \\"Thug\\".  Also \\"Dipping Low\\", and \\"Planet Of Women\\" from Afterburner could have been great additions. But, this is still a good compilation!
0374158460|1.0|This author is confused and is misleading the readers with disinformation. It is a lack of protecting our freedoms that endangers our citizens and our Republic. Freedom is a good thing.<br />This book is a great example of behavior placement that is promoted by the establishment power.<br /><br />Please do not buy this book and support its misleading text.
B0014BECF8|5.0|I have to say I am surprised, I would have expected to have either my money restored or another item shipped to me right away. Instead I was refunded the money and sent out a new item at no charge I have to say I am impressed.
030726999X|5.0|Received the book (very good shape) in a timely manner.  Very pleased with the seller's product.
0891419063|5.0|Until this book, I had not read any personal accounts of war other than Pres. Theodore Roosevelt's account of his charge up San Juan Hill.  But this books shows the true face of war as only an average grunt stuck living every day in the trenches can tell it.  There are very few boisterous adjectives or adverbs in this work.  Instead, the narrative tells about the war with little passion (in a glorious or vain sense), which makes it all the more remarkable and all the more real.  You almost feel as if you were living the war through Sledge's eyes.  Thus, this book, with it's black and white words, pictures, and descriptions has succeeded where so many war movies have failed: making the reader truly understand the meaning of the phrase \\"War is hell.\\"  A classic not just in war lit. or memoirs, but in general, this book should be read by everyone and its conclusions on the barbarity, brutality, senselessness, and (sadly) the necessity of war considered by anyone thinking of joining the armed forces.
1840220554|5.0|Composite book of the Jane Austen novels - in wonderful shape.  I purchased it for a gift and was very pleased!
1419553429|5.0|This book was a perfect match for me, focused, with plenty of really tough questions and thorough explanations. Compared to the official guide much better for getting insight fast and with fun, at least I've enjoyed it.
1592802974|5.0|This book makes for excellent reading, giving perspective on the so-called \\"market wizards\\". It's certainly inspirational
0307236722|5.0|I was so pleased with this book when it came! It has everything from cakes to bagels! As someone who thinks of baking as a hobby like I do this book is just good fun altogether. I haven't baked anything out of this book yet but the first thing I am planning to make is the focasia, bagels and homemade margherita pizza! the layout of this book is great the instructions are clear and everything you need might already be in your cupboards or pantry! It's a great price on here too! Before I bought this book I looked at Martha Stewart's cooking school at Barnes and Noble and I got sticker shock! It was $45 and this one was $40! As a person who might be interested in a new hobby such as baking this is the book for you, and as a person considering going to culinary school like I am this book provides a clear head start for someone about to jump into a baking career :D I can't speak more highly about this book!
0312600844|1.0|This is a crap premise in my opinion. Freedom is a gift from the Divine and the bedrock of our beloved country. Everything that is truly good about humanity can only be expressed through freedom. True freedom, that is. Not what is called 'freedom' currently.   A truly free society is strong and creative and compassionate. If humanity as a whole decided on and demanded true freedom, poverty would be a thing of the past. In every society where freedom has ruled, business, especially small businesses have thrived. And the people in all their glory, as an expression of their human beauty, have created a paradise on blessed Mother Earth.   If freedom reigned, we would not be at the mercy of Monsanto. Cruel factory farms would not exist. The mafia-criminal oil cartel would have been killed off like the dinosaurs, the Gulf of Mexico would still be a majesty of nature, and all the good energy inventions would now be available.   What's not to love about that?   I say, LET FREEDOM RING!!!
0307460444|4.0|I bought this book on my birthday and I was super excited I bought it along with a mini cupcake pan and cupcake liners and I must say that I am very impressed with this book.But I must say even though  Martha Stewart's books have very clear instructions and they inspire you to bake, some of the recipes don't work out! I have made over eight or nine recipes from this book. I made the chai tea mini cupcakes and they were just disgusting the sweetened condensed milk frosting was aweful and the instructions called for too much time so they weren't moist they ended up like muffins. And as pretty as they turn out the vanilla bean cupcakes with candied oranges they were like muffins too and you don't end up tasting the vanilla bean at all. But! there are some very delicous ones I've made from this book too! The chocolate chip cupcakes on page 23 i think it is are to die for! they are so good! the red velvet ones are delicious but the frosting needs less cream cheese, the tiramisu ones were my favorite you don't need the marsala even for the syrup, the vegan chocolate cupcakes don't work out so hot they stick to the liners, and they're not very flavorful. the triple citrus ones are delicious as well. I think I'm going to make the maple syrup ones for Halloween or Thanksgiving I also have Martha Stewart cookies! Have fun with this book I guarantee you will, they are after all, the fun version of muffins ;D
B000SGGUWS|3.0|Pretty Little Liars was a book that had a clever plot but lacked good writing. After all of my friends telling me that it was the best book ever, I bought it and read it in less then a day, but when I was finished I was very dissapointed in the quality of the book and the subject matter. There are no lessons learned in all of the inapropriate stuff these 5 girls do. I have heard that the books get better as the plot thickens, but I will not be reading any more of them.
B0037YOMWS|4.0|WHY I PURCHASE & OWN THIS PRODUCT? (+0.5 star)  I have purchased the HP30b Professional Business Calculator in Singapore to add to my small but growing collection of HP calculators in early September 2010. Admittedly, there is some compulsion in me to own one as a new toy because I have long been a HP calculator junkie.    VALUE vs.COST OF OWNERSHIP (-0.5 star)  HP sells this online for US$49.95(S$70) but it is now available at a higher price tag in Singapore retail shops. My HP30b had cost me S$90(US$65),tax inclusive.       FIRST IMPRESSION (+0.5 star)  At a glance, the metallic silver exterior of the HP30b and button layout resembles the HP17bII+ (current silver version) However, A closer look reveals its HP20b parentage. Notably, the 2-line display of the HP30b appears clearer, larger and more contrasy than the HP20b.     PRODUCT HANDLING - THE TOUCH FACTOR (+0 star)  Overall, the HP30b casing and tactile buttons feels better than HP20b but don't expect the build quality to be near HP12c and HP17bII+ series. Build quality and external material used feels and appears to be the standard \\"Made In China\\" consumer fare,it is still good but nothing fantastic.    LITTLE EXTRA(S) THAT COMES WITH THE BOX (+0 star)  The notable increment is the inclusion of a slip case, a nice bit more than my HP20b purchased 2 years ago. Packaging is minimalistic and environmentally friendly.    POWER FEATURES & FUNCTIONALITY (+2.0 stars)  Here is where the real juice is. The HP30b, priced as a mid-range model from HP simply has no current rival to match its power-packed \\"professional\\" features.    Feature packed and programmable (user customizeable), the HP30b is a great upgrade for HP20b,HP10b and HP17b series users. There are many firsts for the HP30b, most impressively, the new industry first preprogrammed built-in function of Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model (OPM) for pricing \\"European\\" option - a huge \\"WOW\\" killer feature. Personally, I would buy the HP30b solely for this new built in function, this hit the top of my wishlist for the upgrade to the HP20b. This new function activated by \\"Black S\\" button and input of variables in the equation is prompted by a user friendly menu.    For HP junkies, the RPN input feature is also retained and there are many more functions which the power users would like to explore. In a nutshell, the rich feature set of the HP30b will match the user's sophistication and satisfy the most demanding user for many years to come.     Feature and capability is the best reason to own a HP30b - the most powerful HP business calculator to date.    USER SUPPORT & ONLINE RESOURCES (+1.0 star)  HP online product support by HP and independent user group is legendary here, period.     USER RECOMMENDATION (+0.5 star)  Simply the best and latest available from HP for professionals, students and the HP calculator fans.     COMMENTARY  In this age of widespread customized business computing, spreadsheet analysis and business ERP with push button customizable dashboard analytics. One may wonder if sophisticated programmable handheld calculators like the HP30b could still has a place in the office.    I would think that the biggest challenge for the HP30b will come from third party software emulation products which can be easily installed as an application in a touchscreen smartphone or a Notebook PC. An emulator eliminates the need to carry an additional piece of portable handheld device and user license would normally be affordable at a faction of the cost of the equivalent HP hardware. Furthermore, bugs in algorithm and upgrades could easily be performed.     IMHO the HP30b is the most balanced and affordable major upgrade in the HP business calculator line for almost two decades since the HP19b,and should satisfy the most demanding group of HP users until the next major HP upgrade of the line.    Through the release of the HP30b, HP has demonstrated that it is the de facto leader of the pack in this product category. It wouldbe interesting to see a competitor respond to the HP30b and how HP could improve on the HP30b within this mature product category in the near future.     CONCLUSION - HP30b GETS 4 STARS  For their effort, Hewett Packard deserves 4 STARS for the HP30b. It would have been a perfect 5 but we should always leave some room for improvement but no room for complacency.    Thank you for reading my review and sharing of thoughts on the HP30b. Hope it is useful to you.
0307454541|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book!! I couldn't put it down!! I recommend it to EVERYONE! What a fabulous writer! Cannot wait to finish the trilogy!
0312600844|5.0|This is one spectacular piece of writing. The depth of loving attention paid to the development of the book's characters pays off for us readers, delivering people so authentic in their humanity that I almost found myself wondering what they were doing while I was away from the reading tending to \\"real life\\".<br /><br />I was shocked by the vehemence with which a few Amazon reviewers hated this book: it's hard to understand how one reader so resented paying \\"almost full price\\" for FREEDOM when the marketplace is filled with so many less worthy new novels...perhaps he wouldn't have hated it so much if he'd borrowed it from the library!<br /><br />In my opinion Jonathan Franzen's FREEDOM can be favorably compared with some of the classic canon of American novels with it's tight plotting, expansive reach and clearly explored themes. I believe that this  novel will stand time's test as a book that is read more than once and is passed along from friend to friend. It was given to me by someone who loved it and I will pass it on to someone else who I think will love it.
0345363132|5.0|This book has proven to be one of the best purchases I've made in quite a while. I wanted to learn more about Richard III. There were alleged events that just didn't make sense to me (specifically the fate of the young princes after Richard became King). I always felt that Richard was not the tyrant that some historians would have us believe.    Ms. Penman writes as if we are there listening to all the debates, the conversations and all the labyrinthine navigating of political intrigues. She also is able to explore the status of women during those times when marriages were for political gain instead of Love. If Ms. Penman's narrative is close to being accurate, Richard and Anne truly loved each other even with history swirling all around them.    If you want to learn more about a turbulent time in history, I highly recommend this book. You will learn about the history of the houses of York and Lancaster, but more important...you will feel - the peril, the joy, the tragedy - you will feel.    I would love to see this book brought to the screen. There is a British actor - Ricahrd Armitage - whose dream is to bring Richard's story to life. I pray he can accomplish this because he would do justice to this book.
0143058525|2.0|There is nothing wrong that I can say about the book itself. It is a very uplifting story written in an honest and humble way that might appeal to a lot of women and most of all travelers. The author describes the feelings one has when living in a foreign country with a great accuracy. Me, as a person who crossed borders twice, can assure you that this book will give you a true insight of an experience that is settling down in a country of a different culture and language.    I must warn you however from choosing the audio book over a printed version, mostly because of horrible, but horrible Italian pronunciation. The author says that it was the beauty of the language that she fell in love with and the main reason why she pursued her studies and then her trip to Rome. You will have no such experience while listening to this audio book, right the opposite it will give you a great distress... I know for some it is a tiny little detail but for those who love and cherish the Latin heritage of Europe it will sound like a profanation.
0575083093|4.0|In the first few pages, the rich vocabulary and textured writing style of Revelation Space will hook the reader. Meeting terms like \\"adumbrate\\" justify reading fiction! After a few chapters, the jumping between dates takes some concentration but it is then that this novel's greatest strength becomes apparent. Reynolds has not strung together a mix of techno-devices to construct a convenient narrative. He respects that relativistic distances take a long time to traverse, and lives and events must account for this. The technology that makes this plot work is ambitious and exciting, but it does not trample all over physical laws. Readers are rewarded as events gradually focus in a confluence of time period and narrative streams.    Grand scale space opera doesn't always offer philosophical enlightenment. Revelation Space works towards some interesting ideas and concludes well. The occasional 21st century metaphor or perspective is hard to avoid and it is apparent that Reynolds does not feel a need to, although these could grate for some. His professional background ensures fabulous hard science fiction and a tight plot. Chasm City is my next read.
B003XX2PPO|4.0|This is a good record!! a good production,amazing musicians(Robbie Buchanan,jorge calandrelli.) -and THE VOICE..,i mean LUIS IS SINGING BETTER THAN EVER ON THIS RECORD,  SONGS LIKE \\"DE QUIEN ES USTED\\"\\"NO EXISTEN LIMITES\\"\\"LO QUE QUEDA DE MI\\" (manzanero) ARE OUT OF THIS PLANET!, LUIS SINGS WITH SO MUCH EMOTION, THAT TAKES YOU TO ANOTHER PLACE..YOU CAN´T EXPLAIN IT..THE UPTEMPO SONGS ARE GOOD TOO!,MY FAVOURITE \\" ES POR TI\\" ,..Luis puts so much of himself on this record, and participates on the lyrics and music...,THIS IS QUALITY..,Only for the voice and manzanero songs you should buy this record..GRAMMY PLEASE!!!
B00006RCOB|5.0|Excellent transaction/product. The DVD was delivered in a short time and in the exact condition as promised. Will definitely purchase from this seller again.
B003L77GGA|5.0|What the hell??  The show doesn't start til this Friday.  I'm sure this season will be epic.  Based on the teasers seen on TV, looks like Clark will become Superman.  But what is up with that photo.  That has to be photoshopped.  Look how huge Clark's hand is and the direction his arm is heading.  just looks weird.  Totally looking forward to this season.  But seriously Amazon...pre order already???
0312600844|2.0|I DID pay full price for this book based on all the rave reviews.  I have not read Mr. Franzen's first novel.  I am very disappointed.  It took over 80 pages for me to become mildly interested in the characters; I keep reading because I paid so much for it and keep hoping I will find more merit in it than I have so far.  If this book disappeared off my nightstand this very minute, it would be a relief to me, not a loss.  I'm going to try another 25 or so pages - if no improvement, into the \\"donation\\" box it goes - although I feel like I should tag it with a warning to people who want a novel to be interesting - that this isn't the book for them.
B001PO53IO|5.0|I found The Clone Wars to be an excellent, faithful addition to the Star Wars universe that actually FEELS like Star Wars.  During many of the episodes I couldn't help but grin at the excellent animation, intense action, and swashbuckling feel of the whole thing.  Sure, it has some drawbacks, not the least of which are the episodes that center on Jar Jar, but for the most part it's a great series that manages to be fun without pulling any punches.  Highly recommended.
0374158460|1.0|Someone that writes that freedom is a bad thing doesn't deserve one dime of my hard earned money. The concept in this book is one more step to tyranny from the government. What do you expect from someone that supports the establishment (i.e. Oprah) Wake up people you are being conditioned to follow these tyrants to your grave.
0375826726|5.0|Ive read all of the books so far and this one has left me soooooo anxious.  Though inevitable, I was heartbroken when Orimis and Galedr were killed - so sad.  I cant wait for the next book.
B003SWNRU2|5.0|No Udo.  Can't be Accept.  I was wrong.  They have found the perfect vocalist, the missing link.  This album is metal through and through and the sound is fresh and huge.  This is a great album.  'nough said !
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Well, the blu ray is great, the sound is crystal clear and it looks awesome in 1080p, besides the added scenes give more sense to the movie, and the extras do a good compilation of the saga.
B000OVLBFS|4.0|One more in the Jesse Stone saga set in Paradise, Mass.  Tom Selleck is Jesse Stone.He brings to life the flawed character and makes us love him in spite of himself.  Robert B Parker does it again.
B001F9Y2CM|3.0|Although the recorded content is the wonderful sound of ABBA, the box set itself leaves a lot to be desired. The sleeves are not true miniature LP sleeves, but more like picture sleeves for singles (no inner sleeve and no printing on the spine) - with some of the reproduced covers blurred and over-exposed. No great care or time was taken with creating this set - as ABBA would have deserved. Still, this set merited three stars for the good price of the great music contained within. This set might be an ultimate find for those that have no previous ABBA CD's in their collections, or who do not yet have the remastered versions, otherwise it's easily a \\"pass.\\" It is missing the album \\"Live\\" (which was an official release), also \\"Gracias Por La Musica\\" (also official) - and that keeps it from being complete.
B000V3OKW0|2.0|I was intrigued by good reviews found everywhere including here on amazon.   Unfortunately, I didn't like them.   Everything is too slow and too \\"deep\\". Even Rostropovich sounds fresh in comparison.  For a much better performance (and not to mention sound quality) go for Schiff on EMI.  In his hands suites sound fresh and easy.  And they also sound like dance music, as they should.
B003ITZBVS|4.0|overall. the movie is quite good, despite an annoyingly drawn, and uninspired, ill-performed turn by dimaggio as the joker. he is excellent as bender on futurama but is dreadfully miscast by the usually awesome andrea romano. i did not care too much for the facial features of bruce wayne/batman in this movie although they are not too bothersome. the story is good, the animation fairly solid as usual, and bruce greenwood does a fair job at the batman role, though why you would not get kevin conroy to play the role every time is a mystery. the movie is more violent than the norm here, and the change towards more mature viewers is welcome. the supposedly non-super characters still leap enormous gaps, and fall long distances without harm which i would prefer to see toned down to more realistic levels. this installment of the batman animated series tries to be much truer to the contemporary graphic novels which is the right direction, in my opinion.
1416511946|4.0|I enjoyed learning about one of my all-time favorite rock bands.  They seemed like everyday normal guys who wanted to live their dream and it was magic when they came together.  I had no idea that Nikki wrote the majority of the music.  I had no idea they tormented Mick the way they did.  Mick seems to be such a soft-spoken and highly intellectual guy with a raw in-your-face-kick-ass  spirit.  Who wouldn't like him??  I felt bad when big business came in as they always do.  Suits ruin everything.  I pictured Tommy as this playful golden retriever always falling in love with the next puppy that comes along.  Nikki...you had a crumby childhood.  SO many of us did but you rose above that with fame and talent even though it continues to torture you.  You were and are still the best looking in the band and I spent many a night thinking of you in my teenage/early 20 years.  I am so sorry that you and the other guys had to go through all of the chemical b.s.  I hope you are all able to remain in recovery.  The only drawback of the book for me was there was not enough about the recovery.  It was like, I went and that was it.  How hard was it?  What about those of out here who have young daughers who are hooked on heroin that can't afford the Palm Springs or Beverly Hills Rehab Clinics.  My beautiful daughter is 21 and IS a heroin addict and I feel like my hands are tied.  Do you ever reach out to others one-on-one?  If so, I'll take that offer!  Stay strong guys, and do what makes you happy!  Love, Carol
1607060825|5.0|If you like Frank Cho's art. This would be a great sketch book to add.
B00092ZL80|5.0|Great audio sound and clarity. Video great - an outstanding show. A definite buy at any price! You can't believe how good a concert can be until you've seen this one. You'll find that you love everything played!

B0002EXH54|3.0|I bought this CD used for only ten dollars a few years ago. Actually passed up an original copy of Peace Sells (CD) at the time to get this.As a side note i have an original copy of this CD. The remix and remastered version of this album does sound good. The guitars really shine here. You can also hear the high hats and some little subtleties that you could not hear on the original CD. I have not heard the original vinyl record release of this album, so i cannot comment on that. This CD is not a bad choice for someone just getting into Megadeth. The bonus tracks are alternate mixes by Randy Burns. These extra tracks are raw. Some find them inferior in sound, but i love them. Wish the entire album had been originally released in that mix.     Is this remixed and remastered CD inferior to the original no.Some die hards have told me they like the original more.I would have to agree with them on that one.I have the re-issue of Peace Sells on vinyl record. I must say Capitol did a very good job on that record. I will talk about that more on my review for that record.
0385523386|2.0|I gave this an extra star because Piper is an accomplished writer.  However, I find it hard to stomach that everyone she meets in prison is full of quiet dignity or are really good people who just made mistakes due to the drugs/lifestyle they lived and are now ready to step out and be good citizens.  She meets one person who can't wait to get back the drugs and lifestyle.  That seems to put the book into the realm of fantasy.
B0042114X0|4.0|No, it isn't the perfect album and no every song isn't perfect. However, there a lot of good tracks on this cd like \\"young blood\\" and  \\"girls like you\\", \\"all of this\\", \\"punching in a dream\\", and \\"bells.\\" I liked some best coast stuff and enjoyed some of the tracks off of the \\"young\\" ep by summer camp. So if you enjoy those you might enjoy this.
0425152251|5.0|I heard about Sophie's world from a friend who graduated with a degree in Philosophy. My college work is with the history of ideas, but there's certainly significant overlap. I thought I might see if it would be good to give to my parents and siblings so they might have SOME idea just what I was spending my time at college learning. How could I describe why I'd take an entire class of reading Kant? Where to even begin in my discussion of the reception of Kierkegaard, or Western Marxism?    Of course, I couldn't recommend something I hadn't tried myself. I had a bus ride to read it, so I gave it a shot. I found myself quickly wrapped up in it; the drama of intellectual history is wrapped up with the fictional drama splendidly. It means the book is never dull or drags -- as the philosophy gets deeper, the story gets stronger. I plowed right through it.    I couldn't help but wonder, though, if it only went so fast because I was so familiar with the subject. My high-school aged, math-focused younger brother, who hadn't engaged with philosophy at all, picked it up after me. He figured he'd read a chapter a day -- instead, he too wound up pulled in it and finished it quickly, and has found himself looking for more and more ways to get into philosophy.       Is the book comprehensive? No. It's a simple work, and those looking for a more in-depth overview might check out Russell's or Copleston's histories of Philosophy. But it gives a wonderful overview of the history of thought -- a fantastic framework for those starting off, and a charming review for even those swimming deep in the subject.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I didn't watch The Big Bang Theory the first year because I didn't think I'd find it funny. I caught a random show in year 2 and laughed myself silly. Subsequently, I began to watch faithfully and bought all of the years available on DVD. TBBT still makes me laugh out loud more than any other show. I hope it keeps up the high quality and lasts forever.
B002RWKSII|5.0|I bought Brian's new Gershwin album as a gift for my husband, Desi Arnaz Jr. and Desi fell in love with it immediately.  We have listened to it over & over and each time love it more.  Brian Wilson fans will agree this is Brian at his best.  Anyone who is not a Brian Wilson fan yet, will be a fan after hearing this masterpiece.  Buy this album for everyone on your Christmas list.  That's what we're doing!  Amy Arnaz
B002JVWQT6|5.0|I wish they made a new episode everyday I cant get enough of this show.
B000MV8AE0|5.0|Ed Harris and Diane Kruger make this historical, fictional account of Beethoven \\"doing\\" his 9th Symphony come alive with emotion, with reality, and with an understanding of life in the early 19th Century.  When the movie reached its apex highlighted by the formal presentation of the 9th, I found myself wiping away tears of joy!  What an event!  Harris and Kruger make their characters bond in a lasting friendship based on mutual respect for each others skills and abilities.  I gained respect and knowledge watching Beethoven work his way through his growing deafness. If you love perfection in character development, this is your movie!  If you love classical music at its best during this special era, this is your movie!
0061649694|4.0|I first heard of Coraline when the movie was released I was excited to find out that the movie was based on the book by the same name. I never ended up seeing the movie, but the book made it to my to-read list. I have picked it up several times in the bookstore, but never ended up purchasing it. I was inspired to finally make the purchase when I found out it was a challenged book.    This story is geared towards a much younger audience-ages 8 and up-than the books I usually read. I was concerned this would make the story feel childish, but this was not the case. Gaiman created a suspenseful tale that I enjoyed very much. He depicted a rich world that I felt like I was traveling in. The quirkiness of the characters added to the story instead of serving as a distraction. Everything worked well together to create a book I didn't want to put down.    This book has been challenged due to questions of its \\"age appropriateness.\\" It appears that parents have found the book \\"scary for younger children.\\" I know as a 20-something I found parts of this book to be on the scary side. I can see how someone twenty years younger than me would be scared by these passages. However, these bits of the book only added to the suspense. Any fear I experienced was for Coraline, and not for myself. Anything that was scary was written to advance the plot, and not for the sole purpose of scaring someone. The end result is a great tale that I would love to share with my child someday.
0061122416|5.0|I ordered the book because it was a required reading assignment and due to the demand I couldn't get it anywhere else. I started to panic over whether it'd arrive with enough time for me to read it before school but instead it came several days earlier than the estimated delivery date and in better condition than was described, it looked absolutely brand new. I am very happy with the service I recieved as well as with the product. Thank you.
B0036EH3XE|3.0|In the end, all that those dexterous writers and producers have been caring about was putting those unpredictable dramas in each episode to stimulate the viewers and hold their interest every week and season.  Inevitably, they have had to accumulate an enormous pile of unanswered questions all along.  They keep that almost until right before the end of the series, and then sum up everything in somewhat absurd way.  Well, I knew the writers were all exhausted when I saw Hugo saying \\"I have a bad feeling about this\\" during the final episode.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|I am so thrilled with this case for my bluetooth (got both from Amazon). The case is perfect and my blue tooth is protected and easy to find when I have to take it off and put it in my purse. I even charge it in the case. You'll love it too. It's made just for our set.
1439181780|3.0|If you have read the secret, well this book is just the same,But does have some very powerful quotes which I enjoyed more.I was really excited when it came out but sorry after reading the power i was left a bit dissappointed.  But read for yourself and make up your own mind
B003MZ0I84|5.0|Fans of Songs about Jane will not be disappointed. Adam Levine sounds better than ever and the beats are catchy. I can pop this CD in the car and listen to it straight through.
B003XQRZ7E|4.0|This is a real good cd. If you like straight ahead rock then this is it. You will not be disappointed.
B000EGDC14|5.0|I loved Goldfrapp the second I heard them. I was especially in love with their album Felt Mountain. So I took a risk in buying this one to see what it sounded like- man was I in awe! I absolutely love this album and actually listen to a select few songs while I'm working out. My #1 song picks would have to be: Fly Me Away, Ride A White Horse, Beautiful, Number 1, Ooh La La. Fly Me Away and Number 1 have to be my best fav's. If you're not sure if you'd like this album, maybe listen to these few songs on you tube, or napster.. In a whole this album is AWESOME!
0316017922|5.0|Outliers is a terrific book. Gladwell's thesis is that there is more to success than what meets the eye. He investigates with such great curiosity and comes up with counterintuitive and original explanations.<br /><br />His observations on young age bias in sports or music; cultural roots tugging on us so hard we don't even know it and the seemingly small helping hands along that way that can trigger so much success later are all very interesting and thought provoking, as is the 10,000 hour/ten year effort it takes to be the best.<br /><br />As a father of young children it gives me lots to think about as to what's for children.  Some I would say is obvious such as having kids exposed more to books, learning and having confidence. But he supports his arguments in ways that have a certain \\"a-haa\\" to it that gives me more conviction.<br /><br />Ultimately his own personal story is well woven into this and provides the inspiration. I won't spoil it but I'm glad he personalized the book.<br /><br />The writing is quick, tight and attention grabbing. He is terrific at anecdotes, supporting studies and giving his conclusions. You can differ with him but this is his book and I think he's made great points and very persuasively. Well done!
B00006F1LX|5.0|The cd came in the time promised (quickly- within the week)and was in perfect condition.  We wore out the old one and were happy to get the collectors edition to replace it.  Great soundtrack! If you're one for quoting Pulp Fiction, you'll love this.

0345505387|4.0|After being in exile from his beloved Scotland for seemingly forever, in 1743 Jamie Fraser is returning home though he knows the danger he will face in war torn Scotland.  His godfather Murtagh will do what he can to keep Jamie safe because of a death pledge he made to the lad's late parents, but he also knows British Captain Black Jack Randall has a large bounty for the head of Jamie.<br /><br />Meanwhile the MacKenzie clan disputes the return of Jamie.  The chieftain Jamie's Uncle Colum, demands his nephew choose between death and fealty while war chieftain Uncle Dougal demands his death.  However, strange, stubborn and beautiful Claire Randall appears out of nowhere; convoluting the return of the prodigal Scot.  He saves her life and wants her as does his vicious enemy Randall.  Murtagh believes she is an Old Ones' envoy; Randall asserts she is a spy; the feuding uncles believe she is a danger; and Jamie offers his heart even knowing he has hers in spite of also believing she hides something critical from him.<br /><br />This graphic rendition of the original Outlander saga is refreshed by Hoang Nguyen's terrific pictures and told from Jamie's side as opposed to the original mostly seen from the WWII displaced Claire.  The story line is filled with action from the onset, but also lacks the time travel aspects that made the original haunting as the key elements of Claire's husband is two centuries in the future while she falls in love with the enemy of her spouse's ancestor remains in the background.  Thus this leads to a strong historical saga that fans of the long running series. Readers will appreciate the well written return of the Exile in graphic form; newcomers will enjoy the work, but should start with the original novel (see The Outlander).<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
0439023513|5.0|While Mockingjay is definitely different than the first two books, it is just as great - if not better.  If you've read Hunger Games and Catching Fire, You must be dying to read this if you haven't already, and rightfully so.  The book is devastating, action-packed, emotional...and all of this is so appropriate, as these are books about war.  A must read.  Suzanne Collins is wonderful.
0307389839|2.0|We read this book for our book club where two members are runners.  It was a little interesting to me, but sort of boring too.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|This is a good season.  If you've made it to season 5, then you gotta have this.
B003I55BIA|4.0|This definitely isn't one of my all time favorite reads, but I still really enjoyed this book, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend to a friend.  This has a nice pace, and I never felt the book dragging along endlessly.  The love between Alex and Brittany was fun to watch blossom, with the timing done just right.  -Not rushed or unnatural.<br /><br />I know that some people might not love the ending, but I thought it was a great way to end the book, and a nice way to remember Paco. :)
B003XJDT1W|5.0|Zac Brown Band has another solid album here. I listened to it in it's entirety this morning and did not find a song I just didn't like. But there are some real stand outs here.     \\"Knee Deep\\" is another great song in the vein of \\"Toes\\". Jimmy Buffet joins Zac and they really do compliment one another.     \\"Oh My Sweet Carolina\\" may be the best version since Ryan Adams (who joins him here as well). This is a song that really digs deep into your soul. It can make you homesick no matter where \\"home\\" might be.     But then there is the creme de la creme. \\"Colder Weather\\" is not only the best song on this album, but maybe the best song I have heard in the past few years. This song got a lot of play (in my car anyway) from the \\"Pass the Jar\\" live set ZBB put out earlier this year. I have not grown tired of it yet. I will be amazed if it does not end up being a big hit on the radio as well. It is just an excellent song on all fronts.    There are many other great songs as well. But these three are at the top of my list on Day 1. And they make this release a must have!
055358894X|5.0|***SPOILER FREE REVIEW***    This book is fresh, unique, AMAZING, with writing so witty and sharp it cuts like razors.  I love the concept of the anti-hero hero and this book utilizes this concept masterfully.  Not to mention that the story always keeps you on your feet, constantly turning pages just to see what happens next.  The plotline and storylines are nothing short of incredible, you have no idea what is going to happen, but at the same time the twists and turns feel natural and organic.    You grow to love and bond with the characters, you feel their joy and pain as your own.      I read a book a week, have so for over 20 years, so it is no small thing for me to put an author on my top ten favorite list.  Scott Lynch has now made that list.  He is a very talented writer, probably the best dialogue i've ever read evarrrr...    thanks for a great story Scott, you have a fan for life, keep those books coming!!!
B003P8BB5W|5.0|Many of these artists were previously unknown to me, and I came to really love many of these songs.  Definately worth the price - Sia 'My Love' is a lovely song.  'Heavy in Your Arms' is hauntingly beautiful.  A must buy for any Eclipse movie fan and even non-Twihards.

B0001VV1GK|3.0|We bought this for my son because we wanted a sturdy wood toy, instead of the plastic crap so many companies put out.    It was easy but time-consuming to put together. As others have said, the wooden ramps fall off constantly, so I glued them down. My son is too young to get them back up properly and was constantly bringing them to me demanding, \\"Fix it!\\".    I thought this would be very sturdy and unbreakable, but my son managed to break the elevator. He pulled it apart from the piece of wood it is glued to to hold it up. Unfortunately there is now no way for me to glue this back. The piece it attaches too is within a sealed tower and while I can get it out (with much difficulty) I can't hold it out while pushing the elevator against it to glue it. I could probably fix it if I took the whole garage apart, but that is more than I'm willing to do.    The garage comes with 2 extra pieces, a guard station with a guard and a car wash. However these are separate pieces that don't really have a place in the garage. You just need to put them near the garage. I think they should have been integrated somehow into the garage, as my son never uses them since they always wind up somewhere in the toy box.    On the whole I'm disappointed in this. The ramps aren't even cool to let the cars fly down. The top ramp the car just stops or crashes over the edge of the 2nd floor of the garage. And the bottom ramp the car will sometimes fly down and across the room, but half the time it goes a little crooked and crashes into the elevator or the other side of the ramp.

B002N5N5LG|5.0|Though Modern Family got all the acclaim, Community was easily the funniest new comedy of the 2009 season on network television. Unlike the competition, Community continued to evolve as the season progressed, resulting in outlandish (and hilarious) episodes that reflected an ability to respond to critical and public comment and deliver for fans. Each episode is packed with well-written jokes that may take a few viewings to completely absorb, so I look forward to this DVD set and all the extras included.
B003L20IE2|5.0|Michael Cera stars as the title character who tries to win over new-girl-in-town Ramona but before they can be together, he must defeat her seven evil exes. The plot is really that simple, but definitely original. Styled like a video game movie in an alternate universe that's not that different from our own, SPVTW is seriously one of the most entertaining movies I've seen all year.<br /><br />The movie is set in Toronto, Canada, and features a cast of characters to which maybe only one is over the age of 30, and they are only in it briefly. You really cannot compare this movie to anything else, but if I was forced to I would say it's like if Kill Bill was crossed with Dude, Where's My Car.<br /><br />I've often said that one sign of a great movie is if when it ends I'm ready to watch it again. This is one of those movies. I saw it twice during the first week of theatrical release, and will buy it as soon as it comes out on November 9th.  It won't be for everyone, and should definitely be avoided by those who have a headache going in, but if you want to see a totally entertaining movie that is unlike most everything else out there (which is a rarity these days), get a life and see this movie. I would give it an 8.5 out of 10.
0374158460|5.0|Franzen's novel got saddled with a \\"work of genius\\" label even before it was released, creating a hype storm so ferocious that it would be hard for any book to live up to.  So, I'll step back for a moment, imagine that I hadn't heard any of the advance publicity and declare: I  thoroughly enjoyed Freedom.<br /><br />I enjoyed it for all of the same reasons that I enjoyed The Corrections. the prose is sharp and witty and the characters are maddeningly, engrossingly screwed up. You can't wait to see how the train wreck of their lives unwinds...or how much worse it can get. And isn't that the very definition of an entertaining tale?<br /><br />Patty is relatively well off, solidly middle class, a successful parent and yet deeply, troublingly unhappy. Her husband Walter is  kind, considerate, loving and so idealistic that it simply makes Patty more miserable. And Walter's best friend Richard complicates both of their lives for decades on end. Throw in their son Joey, who seems to live to do nothing other than anger and disappoint his father in precisely calculated ways, and you have a cauldron of drama.<br /><br />Freedom is more than a collection of intricate, well-drawn characters, it's an examination and commentary on Our Modern American Life with all of its contradictions, guilt, and self awareness of our role in a world apparently swirling down the drain as a result of everything we've done with it. It's a review of where we are now. It's an analysis of how people with so much can still be deeply unhappy.
0471267554|5.0|I HAD been a vegetarian/vegan for 31 years.     After having a major health crisis in the first half of this year, I went through allergy testing. With a CRP of 17.2, my holisic physician wanted me to start eliminating all foods that I reacted to. The testing showed an allergy to most grains, dairy, yeasts, soy and other legumes, nightshades, some nuts, and cabbage. Not much left for a veg to eat, especially protein. I knew I had to change my whole way of eating. I did an extensive search online, and the Paleo diet came up, so thought I would give it a read. This book made so much sense to me. After 2 months following the plan, My CRP is down to 11, and my cholesterol levels have remained perfect.  This plan works!  The book is easy to read and everything is explained in laymans terms. This is the best place to start if you are ready to change your way of eating. I will be sharing this book with everyone I know.

B003HKN51Q|5.0|Elvis on Tour being released on DVD and Blu-ray is a dream finally realized by many fans.  We've waited so many years for this to happen.  I won't go into what's on the disc because you can already read that, but instead, I'll review my thoughts on the blu-ray disc.      I initially was going to purchase the regular DVD.  I didn't feel that blu-ray would make a difference in viewing quality.  This was my mindset because we have a blu-ray player and a projection screen TV and the picture quality was so-so, plus we never took advantage of HD on our TV.  We were naïve, I know.  I didn't purchase this through Amazon, but instead Best Buy.  I went into Best Buy looking for the regular DVD.  They didn't have it, so I purchased the blu-ray instead.  Of course I watched it when I returned home and it looked like I expected...1970s-quality TV.  I wasn't disappointed, but I expected more from the blu-ray.      Our TV finally died and we replaced it with a Sharp Aquos [[ASIN:B002BNMPCU Sharp AQUOS LC46LE700UN 46-Inch 1080p 120 Hz LED HDTV]].  Oh man...the first thing I did was put Elvis on Tour in the blu-ray player.  I was absolutely blown away by the image quality.  The colors pop out, especially the blue jumpsuit.  It's like Elvis is in the room with you.  I can honestly say that this is the first time I've ever seen Elvis look so real.  It's a beautiful and wonderful thing.  I know what you're thinking...maybe it's just the new TV.  Yes, maybe it is, but I tried a regular DVD and while the quality is still good, it's not blu-ray good.  If you want to watch Elvis in the best possible way, choose the blu-ray over the standard DVD.  You will not be disappointed.  It's more $$, but I think it's worth it.
0545310601|2.0|Here's a suggestion: if you like young adult dystopian novels, read [[ASIN:0385732554 The Giver]].  And another: If you like science fiction revolt novels, read [[ASIN:0312863551 The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress]].  Heck, I'll give you another: if you like youth in revolt novels, read [[ASIN:0440442508 Johnny Tremain]].  Ignore the hype, this series is not worth your time.<br /><br />I read all three books in the month after the release of, and the associated hype involved of Mockingjay.  I don't know where the hype came from.  Collins writes with a subdued color-scheme and nothing pops off the page.  For me, the characters were too flat.  This leads to unbelievable relationships or at the very least relationships where there seems to be nothing at stake; a problem when your tale centers on a love triangle.  The only relationship with any sense of truth is that of Katniss and her sister, and that stays in the background as a tertiary relationship until the end.<br /><br />It's not just the characters that are flat.  I had to reconceptionalize what was bugging me during the long exposition periods of the first two books and I think I figured it out.  Her setting is flat.  Collins seems not to fully have done her homework on economics, politics, or science.  I just never believe the world she builds and that pollutes the story she tries to impose on top of this foundation.<br /><br />If Collins' weakness is in characterization and setting, her strength is in writing action.  This book, as the others, move along well once Katniss and her team are shooting something or killing things.  Mockingjay hits that point sooner than the others, so in a manner this is the best of the series.  However, there are a couple of twists at the end that feel slightly telegraphed and partly clich&eacute;d.  These are poorly done and either are meant to give the reader credit for their cleverness in knowing what is going to happen or to surprise them with a twist.  I'm not sure, but I think it represents the feelings I have about the series as a whole: There's the seed of a good idea, but overall it is poorly executed.represents the feelings I have about the series as a whole: There's the seed of a good idea, but overall it is poorly executed.
B0001WTVUW|5.0|When this movie first came out it was the height of the 80s and the fear of the nukes launching was on every ones minds. I remember when it came out of my room at night and I asked if I can watch it because many of my friends said they planned to watch it, but my parents said no. Back then I was allowed to watch movies that were rated R, I watched scary movies and many other rated R and it did not bother me. But this one they said no. After the 3 night movie was over I was like wow that sucks and I wanted to watch it. Not until I went to college and a friend had it in his video collection. So we sat down and watch it one afternoon and I was at a awe. The effects was astounding, for a movie that was made in the 80s for television. The many horrible things that happened to the people with the radiation all over the place, was Scary I do not get scared and when I saw this movie I was like wow now I understand why my parents did not want me to watch the movie. Radiation sickness, hair falling out, going blind from looking at the nuke going off, and other things that was disturbing to me. This movie was not as much as a anti war movie but as a anti nuke movie.<br />The characters in the movie were convincing and the dark grim look was astounding. It was very graphic for its time and I remember that it was very controversial. I now why now later when I watch , that my parents did not want me to watch the show. It was scary for that time to which the movie was made and it had a profound effect on president Reagen. It leaked out that after he saw the movie he made a call on the Red phone and wanted to try to find a way to redouse nukes stockpiles. It had a powerful feel to the film, it actually showed the best way they can at the time the horrible and evil that Nukes can do to normal every day America, People who just wanted to get married, go to school, work his farm, and see her daughter get married like all moms do. Over all the movie is good and makes a good statement, but remember that it was made in the 80s not the now.remember that it was made in the 80s not the now.

B003JTHXOK|3.0|Totally reminded me of Sleeping with the Enemy.  Fast read, hoped it would get better, but it stalled out.  Doesn't seem to be the Sparks I've been used to.  It's a shame I waited so long for this, that now I have to wait another year for him to hopefully redeem himself.  The writing style didn't seem familiar this time around, I hope Sparks hasn't gone a rye like many other popular authors.

B003PWPGT0|4.0|When I first heard this on charlie rose, I wasn't sure what I thought of it. The music is differant than anything he's ever done and he sounds like some else in some of the songs. It has kind of more bluesy with a little bit of physcheldelic mixed in. Their are also songs with long instrumental sets. ( something I don't care for)  But once you start listening you can't stop the instruments all blend together and the words are like poetry. Esp on the songs let yourself go and pirates go. He even has a song about a certian controversial drug that he thinks should be legalized. ( It is done in a very lighthearted way though that will make you laugh.

B00006IUL7|4.0|Insomnia was Christopher Nolan's next film after Memento. He is moving up the ladder to the next level, with big name actors--Al Pacino, Robin Williams, and Hillary Swank. Not quite up to block buster status with The Dark Knight or Inception, but he is a rising star. Insomnia was a remake of the 1997 Insomnia by Norwegian director Erik Skjoldbjærg.<br /><br />Instead of Norway, the remake is set in Alaska, so far North that the sun doesn't set for months. This wrecks havoc on the sleep cycles of Detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino), an LA cop who arrives to help with the investigation of the murder of a young woman. Besides the Midnight Sun, there is something else troubling the detective's sleep. Like MacBeth, he thinks that \\"sleep should knit the raveled sleeve of care\\" but sleep is no more. MacBeth, and Dormer, have murdered sleep. Dormer is under investigation by Internal Affairs for possibly fabricating evidence. As he tries to cover his tracks, he gets in deeper trouble.<br /><br />Rookie Detective Ellie Burr (Hillary Swank) looks up to Dormer, who she has studied in Detective School. She quotes from his text books, and is anxious to learn what she can from the man himself:<br /><br />-----------------------<br />Dormer: You shouldn't knock misdemeanors.<br />Det. Ellie Burr: Oh, but it's small stuff. It gets so boring.<br />Dormer: It's all about small stuff. You know, small lies, small mistakes. People give themselves away, same in misdemeanors as they do on murder cases. It's just human nature. Aren't you gonna write that down?<br />====================<br /><br />When this situation arrives in a film there is an interesting sub text, and that is that the young actor is playing a character who is learning from the more experienced character, and at the same time taking an acting class. This happened in The Color of Money where Tom Cruise played a pool hustler being schooled by Fast Eddie, played by Paul Newman. Al Pacino takes Swank to school, and really gives an amazing performance. Robin Williams also gets a chance to stretch his acting chops playing the enigmatic suspect, Finch. Swank is a quick learner, and her performance is solid.<br /><br />-----------------------<br />Dormer: We better find out where this came from.<br />Det. Ellie Burr: I tried. Mrs. Connell doesn't know, her friends didn't know.<br />Dormer: Have you tried the jewelry stores? Small things, remember? The second you're about to dismiss something, think about it. Look at it again.<br />Det. Ellie Burr: Want me to write that down?<br />Dormer: No, I'll remember it.<br />====================<br /><br />Director Christopher Nolan is also going to film school, but he is a quick learner, too. This film presented some interesting challenges. First and foremost, how do you depict insomnia without providing a cure for insomnia? Without putting the audience to sleep? The far North setting was beautiful, but all that white snow could be monotonous. Scenes in the fog were good at creating an atmosphere where the lines between right and wrong were blurred, but it could also lull you into a trance. The film was a murder mystery, but it was less concerned with finding who did it then it was with exploring moral dilemmas. The ways in which the detective and the killer were similar. If you do something wrong for the right reasons, does that make it OK? What happens once you cross that line...<br /><br />-----------------------<br />Dormer: This guy crossed the line and didn't even blink.<br />====================<br /><br />I don't see you blinking either, Detective. Maura Tierney plays the Detective's landlady, Rachel Clement. She has an interesting take on moral dilemmas, too.<br /><br />-----------------------<br />Rachel Clement: I can't judge. There are two kinds of people in Alaska: those who were born here and those who come here to escape something. I wasn't born here.<br />====================<br /><br />I wish this character could have been developed alittle more. Just what it was she was escaping was never resolved.<br /><br />The Bottom Line is that Insomnia is a solid effort by Christopher Nolan on his way to bigger and better things. I would preferr to just watch the original--besides I heard that it was darker, and some of the changes kind of watered it down. In the original his interrogation techniques are much harsher, and instead of firing his gun in a dead dog to fabricate some evidence, he kills a dog. Great performances by Swank, Pacino, and Williams, in a setting that makes a good metaphor for the grey area between wake and sleep, and right and wrong. Like Detective Ellie Burr we are left with a question:<br /><br />-----------------------<br />Det.

B003TML0VO|5.0|..Probably not. But it's definitely worth more than the one star given by some. I've enjoyed most of the tracks, although for me I would prefer a little more latin, and a bit more Santana.
B003XX2PPO|4.0|I'm a huge LM fan. That being said, I liked his new album. The Voice shines yet again, but...he definitely needs a production team make-over. For his future pop albums, he needs to work with a fresh production team, not the same old tried and true ones from the past. LM really should reinvent himself, he needs too. He would gain so much more market share. His fans really would like something fresh, as is evidenced by most of the reviews here.    This album has great ballads and a nice mix of up-tempo songs. Worth buying if you're a fan. However, this album won't win him any new fans. Why?, you may ask. Because it's out-dated. 10 years ago, this album would have rocked. Today, not so much.    For his next pop album, I think LM should have several different writers. It would be cool if Juan Luis Guerra wrote a couple of songs for him, as well as Juan Carlos Calderon, and Armando Manzanero, and even his bud Alejandro Sanz. These guys would provide great lyrics. LM should not write more songs without the guidance of a 'master' songwriter. And his production team should be well-known U.S. based producers who could catapult LM to the top of the charts in both the Latin market and the global market.    I also hope that LM records another album right away. He should release a new Mariachi album with half of the songs brand new, and the other half cover classics. Then, another Bolero album that would match his 1st and 3rd ones. After that, another pop album where hopefully, he lets big-name producers manage the project where he could have some English songs on the album as well. LM could be so much bigger, if only he allowed himself to be.

B000KGGIQY|4.0|Joaquin Phoenix's towering performance and Reese Witherspoon Oscar-awarded breakthrough carry this 2005 movie, which ranks among the better biopics of the decade. Much of the credit for this goes to the T-Bone Burnett's music, which helps the screenplay overcome some bumpy passages. Both leads act and sing their hearts out, which is a good thing, as it makes for some top-class entertainment - with heart, too. Johnny Cash and June Carter deserved this, it's no shame at all.
B003WSFXKY|1.0|I have to start by saying that I've followed Santana since the first album back in '67 and he remains my favourite guitarist, instantly recognizable for his distinctive style and lyrical beauty.  But this? No, no, no! The title makes it sound like one of those cobbled together 'Greatest Ever' compilations that come out at Christmas.  1992's Milagro was the last Santana album to feature anything like the band proper, even then representing a commercial slide.  This is the third in a sequence of so called star-studded albums that led to a major comeback in the last ten years.  Even so, these have received mixed reviews, iTunes saying that 'All that I am' shows 'Santana functioning as a supporting musician to a parade of guest stars singing pop songs'. I think that's well put and I had no interest in buying either of these cd's.   This latest effort is the pits - how many of these songs would you really call guitar classics? 'Bang a Gong?' Others are ruined and at least three (Beatles, Zeppelin and Doors) have originals that no one should be allowed to mess with. Hendrix's 'Little Wing' gets a fine treatment as you would expect from Joe Cocker. I don't know most of these 'guest' vocalists (OK, maybe that's an age thing!) but the whole thing comes over as a glorified karaoke exercise. Maybe it's all been done as a favour to Clive Davis. I've been hoping for years that Carlos would release an instrumental album, but it has become increasingly a forlorn hope as he appears to have been sucked into this phony pop success (excess?). I'm off to play Caravanserai or Moonflower or anything but this.
1439181780|4.0|It is not as good or well written as the Secret.  It becomes a little redundant, but the teaching is good.  Probably best read in a library rather than purchasing.
B00383UJ2U|5.0|First off, I live in the U.S., which makes it sort of difficult to get this album.  You have to buy the physical CD, or wait until the U.S. I-Tunes store catches up to the U.K. store, and actually offers the album for download. Fortunately for me, I am rather old-school and like having the actual physical CD. Yep, I'm over 35.  This album is phenom. It does have a bit of retro 80s flair to it, but not so much that after one or two listens, you feel like throwing the CD out the window and dismissing it as mere 80s copycat crap. 80s influenced? Probably. But is that a good thing? Hell yes! Listening to the CD brings to mind classic OMD, Depeche Mode, Pet Shop Boys, and other such 80s greats, but it still has it's own sound. Enough influence to catch your attention, yet enough of it's own merit and style to keep you wanting more.  Do yourself a favor- if you even consider yourself a minor fan of electro-pop, purchase this CD. If you consider yourself a major fan of the electronic/synthpop genre, then this is right up your alley.  You will not be disappointed!

They did it by delivering WOW to customers, in the form of service that exceeds expectations.<br /><br />Simply put, Zappos provides an experience people are eager to tell others about. By \\"delivering happiness,\\" Zappos ensures many millions of dollars in repeat and referral business every year.<br /><br />This message couldn't be more timely. In a recession, anything you can do to build loyalty and word-of-mouth with your existing customers will pay you back in spades.<br /><br />This book was fun and fast-paced (I read half of it during breaks at my daughter's lacrosse games). Any motivated business owner can profit from Tony Hsieh's ideas.<br /><br />Here are three takeaways:<br /><br />1. Advertise less. Retain and resell more<br /><br />Early on, Zappos chose to spend more on getting current customers to buy again and more frequently, than on convincing strangers to buy. They did this by making customer service the focus of the company.<br /><br />If you own a business, this leads to 3 questions: How much do you spend on marketing/advertising? How much on customers service/retention? How can you invest more money in the latter?<br /><br />2. Deliver WOW<br /><br />Tony Hsieh believes (correctly) that people remember experiences longer and more fondly than things.

B00005JKNC|5.0|I love this movie, Jim Carrey really shines and shows his excellent acting potential outside of a comedy film (not that this isn't comedic at time). A wonderful film and story.
B003TML0VO|1.0|A series of this? A volume two? Aaaaargh! This is the third album in a series where Carlos is little more than a supporting artist to a bunch of pop stars. These covers are diabolical with maybe the exception of Joe Cocker's 'Little Wing'. Guitar classics? Like 'Bang a Gong'? They should have been left alone - the Beatles, Zeppelin and Doors tracks especially, which no one should be allowed to mess with. Please someone have a word with him to get the Santana band together again.
B000ZNRBK4|5.0|When I got my new [[ASIN:B000ZMCILW Nikon 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G AF-S DX VR Nikkor Zoom Lens]], the first thing that I did was to purchase a 52mm UV filter, more to protect the surface of the quality glass than anything. Wanted to get a lens hood, but all the dealer could offer was a rubber collapsable 52mm lens shade that screwed into the end of the filter. I asked about the one from Nikon, but he didn't have one, telling me that his rubber one was just as good.<br /><br />I screwed his rubber hood onto my new lens, and took a couple of shots with it at 18mm (~28mm in 35mm film camera terms), the widest position available. On viewing the images in the LCD, one could see a vignetting (image cutoff) in the corners, which was unacceptable. Didn't argue with the salesman, but declined.<br /><br />Had to go to another camera store in the area that day, and while there I saw an interesting product. They are billed here as a \\"52mm Flower Petal Lens Hood.\\" The price seemed right for this 'cookie-cutter' style hood, so I grabbed it. This is where I should have used more common sense: The front portion of the 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G AF-S DX VR Nikkor Zoom Lens is not stationary as it focuses. It rotates as the lens is focused, and when that happens at the wide setting, it causes even more vignetting than the rubber hood .<br /><br />The following day came online here and ordered the [[ASIN:B000ZNRBK4 Nikon HB-45 Lens Hood]], which is the correct one for this lens according to the Nikon site itself. During those first couple of days before it arrived, I had a couple of occasions that I wish that I had it, as some of the shots that I was taking did have a mild amount of lens flare due to the angle of my shots where the sun hit the front of the lens. Adjusted my shooting angle slightly to reduce the problem, but it was inconvenient.<br /><br />When the HB-45 hood arrived, the first thing that I did was to put it on in the reverse position, as some had suggested that it might not stow away in that position. Found to my relief that is did indeed fit in the reversed position, making it very convenient for packing away in the camera bag. I then put the hood on the 18-55mm VR Nikkor zoom and found that it snapped into place perfectly when the two release tabs were pushed. The hood locks into position, and rotates with the focus movement of the front of the lens barrel itself, as it should.<br /><br />In the weeks that I've had it so far, it has been the perfect solution for this lens. It has exhibited no vignetting whatsoever, even at the widest (18mm) range of the lens itself.<br /><br />Would call this a key essential for anyone wanting to get good results consistently with this \\"normal\\" zoom, which often comes as the default choice for those purchasing the [[ASIN:B00267S7TQ Nikon D5000 DSLR]], like I have, or the extremely popular [[ASIN:B002JCSV5I Nikon D3000 Digital SLR]]. In either case, it's an excellent choice... once one has put a good quality UV (or skylight) filter on the lens. It might also be suggested to any dealer reading this to stock a couple of these for those of us picky customers who want the real thing for their new lenses.<br /><br />If I had to take any issue with this len hood it's due to the price, but having had a variety of Nikkor lenses in the 35mm SLR days, have gotten used to it. At least this one doesn't have a problem threading into the lens they way that the old metal ones did on the old Nikkor lenses.<br /><br />In short, it's a worthy investment for your lens that won't vignette your images, and it does travel well in the camera bag. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Updated 1/17/2012:<br /><br />Recently saw a \\"52mm Hard Tulip Lens Hood for Nikon DX 18-55mm\\" listed here on Amazon, so I took a look at it. This is exactly the type of lens hood that I described at the beginning of this review, and they do cause image cutting or vignetting, so consider yourself warned.that is did indeed fit in the reversed position, making it very convenient for packing away in the camera bag.

B00028HBKC|1.0|PATHETIC.    SICK...truly SICK.  This film has been wrongly categorized and is really nothing but a HORROR / SLASHER FILM, incorporating elements of the supernatural, but mostly just long lasting sadistic torture....all somehow presumably presented for our entertainment.  OH, and it's in LATIN. Yeah. Fun. If you love watching someone being tortured to death over a two hour period, then this film is for you.      This film has nothing entertaining in it (I don't find torture entertaining) and provides nothing that makes us feel good or is uplifting or is of any benefit, except for maybe the some very few interesting costumes and some good visual effects, editing and camera work. This film does not teach any moral lesson or show any examples of doing good for others or how to better one's life or the lives of others. There are no spiritual lessons or examples or guides to spirituality.  There is nothing that inspires any human to be a better human being.      Mel gibson's use of eccentric and malformed persons laughing and heckling during one early scene somehow used to convey evil by their malformed appearance is particularly offensive to me as persons who in real life are malformed or suffer other natural disabilities are not intrinsically evil and such malformations are not caused out of some evil act.  I expect the musical score was inspired, or more accurately copied, from Martin Scorsese's Last Temptation of Christ.  There is nothing creative here.    Mel Gibson seems to be a deeply troubled person with a particular penchant for rewriting history and attacking people, beliefs and ways of life that he finds weird or different or that he simply does not relate to.  I wish he would have just continued acting and have kept his mouth shut; he would have been much easier to like.     I find this film's level of outrage just below that of Pier Paolo Passolini's Salo; I own a copy of that film for some very specific reasons, mostly out of my high regard for free speech,rarely watch it due to its potency and perversity, and would never consider owning a copy of this pathetic piece of crap as it seems to have no redeeming value.      I imagine Alex, the lead character in A Clockwork Orange, would likely find this entertaining.....Alex in his natural, pre-corrected state.     SICK SICK SICK ....and just a HORROR FILM.
0307454541|1.0|This is an international bestseller? I am speechless. The story itself is not so bad but Stieg Larsson really doesn't make the smallest effort to conceal that he had a clear set of political beliefs. \\"She turned on the TV to watch Rapport but very soon tired of the reasoned commentary on why President Bush had to bomb Iraq to smitherness\\". The absolutely worst thing is the absence of any editor who would cut out parts that make absolutely no sense. Like when one of the characters buys a new computer and our author lists it's every technical spec (Apple Powerbook 1.8Ghz, 950MB RAM, 60GB Harddisk, bluetooth and optical drive - I'm not kidding, it's really there like this). Other time you see that he wants to blast some Swedish policy of legal guardianship because he just hated it in real life. So why not to include it in the book, leave the main story at one point and write 3 pages of reasons why this policy is bad. I'm gonna finish this book because the main story might be good...but that would be it for me with Stieg Larsson.
B002XMGGJM|4.0|I recently had the pleasure to see the movie, \\"Law Abiding Citizen.\\"<br /><br />The story was dramatic and well told. It is a most timely movie with the trial of the Cheshire home invasion and triple murder of the family of Dr. William Petit Jr. This trial is the front page story of the New Haven newspapers and the movie is a searing reminder of what can happen.<br /><br />Gerard Butler portrays Clyde Shelton who is playing with his little daughter when someone comes to the door.<br /><br />He answers the door with a smile of innocence only to see his world disappear before his eyes.<br /><br />Two men crash into Shelton's home, tie him up and put tape across his mouth and then kills his wife and daughter before his eyes.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx does a first class job as the prosecuting attorney, Nick Rice. Rice has a high conviction rate and rather than try this case and send both men to the death chamber for their crime. He makes a deal with one of the killers to testify against the other. This sends one of the men to death row but the other gets a light sentence and is released from prison in a few years.<br /><br />Shelton is enraged at this injustice and waits for his opportunity and then takes vengence against the killers and the entire judicual process.<br /><br />The writer, Kurt Wimmer, did a high quality job in this thriller. It holds the viewer's attention throughout.  It is realistically filemd with a part of the movie filmed at the former Broad Meadows correctional facility.<br /><br />One of the more enjoyable films I have had the pleasure of viewing.
B0032FPVKE|3.0|I have to agree with previous reviews of this item - It is smaller than expected.  I guess the size of camcorders has shrunk considerably!  I planned on using this bag for storing my Panasonic GF-1 camera and one additional lens, but it is only large enough for storing the camera.  Build quality of the bag is surprising good, however.  So, if you only need a bag to store a small camera, this is a pretty good bag for the price - but it is not large enough for storing a full-size SLR.
B003WSFXKY|2.0|I like Carlos Santana, but his recent collaborations with other artists are getting very bland for me!   I thought this had a chance, but it's to polished and just seems to predictable.  The only songs I really liked were the Joe Cocker \\"Little Wing\\" and Jonny Lang \\"I Ain't Superstitious\\".  The really bad are \\"Dance The Night Away\\" with Pat Mohahan, \\"Sunshine Of Your Love\\" with Rob Thomas and \\"Fortunate Son\\" with Scott Stapp.  Please Carlos just go back to performing by yourself or with a really good band! *1/2 stars overall.
B0019NB9A2|4.0|This 1956 science fiction film is a known classic. Despite the warnings of Dr. Morbius, a spacecruiser insists on landing on Altair-4 to investigate the planet and what happened to the rest of Dr. Morbius' original colleagues. Dr. Morbius now lives alone on the planet save for his daughter and his robot named Robby.  But there is a malevolent presence on the planet, both mysterious and invisible.<br /><br />The film stars Walter Pidgeon as Dr. Morbius, Anne Francis as his daughter, and Leslie Nielsen as the daring spacecruiser Commander. It boasts the first ever all-electronic score, that certainly adds to the eerie ambiance and adds suspense. Unfortunately, the balance was a bit off - the electronic noises got very tedious and had to be turned down, while the dialog had to be turned up. It was a lot of fun to spot what possible inspiration spawned other favorite scifi technology, such as the Star Trek transporter beams. This classic is a must-see for science fiction fans, as it helped pave the way for future scifi.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I can honestly say that I am addicted to these books. This book however had to be my absolute fave. of the series. There were a lot of traitors and betrayal in this one which made it kind of confusing. I waited 11 months for this book and I was not disapointed. Katniss was kind of crazy after the games wich put a damper on the action for a while but soon it heats up. I was confused about who was good because it's all from Katnis's veiw and most of the time she's not sure who wants to kill her or who she wants to kill. But I can honestly say that these books are my newest obbsesion. I would definantly recomend this for a fan of Twilight (which i love too) or a fan of the Harry Potter books which I'm still obsessed with. A++ Suzanne Collins!
B000VWE5OY|3.0|This is a review with a bit of a difference considering I've never watched a single episode of Doctor Who in my life (I'll get to it eventually), despite knowing that \\"Torchwood\\" is a spin-off of that entertainment juggernaut, and in fact derives its name from an anagram of its mother show. But I'd been told that knowledge of the prior show was not strictly necessary, and thought perhaps I'd be able to watch with fresh eyes and without inevitably drawing comparisons with the original show.<br /><br />Gwen Cooper is a young police officer who happens to be present when a crime scene is interrupted by a mysterious group of people who are offhandedly referred to as Torchwood by her colleges. She watches in astonishment from a nearby car-park building as the team use a gauntlet to temporarily resurrect the murder victim, and begins her own private investigation into discovering who exactly these people are.<br /><br />Turns out that Torchwood is a secret organization \\"outside the government, beyond the police\\" which is led by the enigmatic, charismatic, long coat-wearing Captain Jack Harkness, who is intrigued by Gwen's disapproving point of view on their activities. After being introduced to the rest of the team: Doctor Owen Harper, computer genius Toshiko Sato, faithful butler Ianto Jones, and second-in-command Suzie Costello; Gwen learns that there's a rift in space and time over Cardiff, resulting in an influx of aliens, time-travel and other bizarre occurrences that require a specialized team of experts to deal with. That's where Torchwood comes in.<br /><br />Unexpected tragedy means that a space opens up on the team, and Jack invites Gwen to join in order to infuse some degree of humanity in the business-like dealings of the Torchwood team. She agrees; a decision that will change her life forever. Thirteen episodes in all, the show purports to be a grownup sci-fi show that melds the detective work of CSI with plenty of sex, gore and violence. For the most part the episodes are standalone, with little continuity between them (unless you count the meaningless entanglements that the staff have with each other or with one-shot guest stars), and many of them follow basic sci-fi storylines. There's the one with the parasitic alien, the time-traveling visitors, the alien fight club, the device which reads minds, etc.<br /><br />Yet when the show finds its feet, it suddenly becomes very, very good. Jack Harkness is an intriguing character with a mysterious past and an immunity to death. His agenda suggests that he knows more than he's letting on, whilst simultaneously being just as baffled about his own existence as the rest of his team. The scenes that centre on him and John Barrowman's boisterous, enthusiastic, larger-than-life performances are invariably the scenes worth tuning in for. Other episodes such as \\"They Keep Killing Suzie\\" have intricate plots, nuanced characterization and themes on the nature of life and the cost of immorality that are truly thought-provoking.<br /><br />To make a long story short, the first season of Torchwood is a mixed bag. There's plenty of potential, and lots of pay-off, but the characterization and general content are often frustrating. For the record, I don't consider three stars a \\"bad\\" review by any means, but to my mind at least, the biggest detriments of the show are threefold.<br /><br />As mentioned, the show tries to pass itself off as \\"adult\\" by making it a darker and edgier version of Doctor Who. Here's the rub: the process of making something \\"darker and edgier\\" has been interpreted as \\"adding more sex, profanity and violence.\\" This does not automatically make a show more adult, in fact it has the opposite effect and can make it seem quite juvenile at times. Despite repeated claims by writers and producers in the DVD extras that their use of sex and violence is not gratuitous, most of the time it *is* gratuitous and serves no real purpose beyond giving the writers the opportunity topoint at the screen and say: \\"look at how edgy we're being!\\"<br /><br />Another serious problem is the fact that many of characters simply aren't very likeable: not in the \\"flawed but human\\" way, but in the \\"what a jerk!\\" way. Essentially, most of them act like irresponsible and immature children, only with sex drives that they can't seem to keep in check. The drama of the show doesn't derive from characters grappling with moral conundrums or with the weight of the responsibility placed on them, but from their inability to keep their pants on. The relationships they foster are shallow and meaningless, and the audience is given little reason to care about any of them.<br /><br />In particular, the focus of the show keeps coming back to Gwen and Owen. Although Tosh is a cool intellectual and Ianto is a sweetheart, the writers seem to be more interested in making most of the plots revolve around Gwen and Owen; the former an inconsistent character who never seems to do the job that she was hired for, and the latter a complete jerk. Gwen is apparently meant to be the empathetic one, but this usually involves her trusting the wrong people, getting aggravated with her team mates when she feels they're not being compassionate enough, and cheating on her boyfriend.<br /><br />Owen is meant to be a dark, smooth ladies man, except that the actor isn't really handsome or charming enough to pull it off, and in his first appearance he's using an alien aphrodisiac to entice strangers into having sex with him. Wow, just like a sex offender with date-rape pills! Later he makes a rather disgusting proposition to Gwen whilst he has her forcibly pinned against a tree, and by the end of the episode they're sleeping together. Even Jack, ostentatiously the main character, is marginalized in favor of these two.<br /><br />Finally there are also some things that just plain don't make sense. If Torchwood is a secret organization, why do they drive around in a giant SUV with flashing lights and blaring music? Why is this team of \\"experts\\" so ridiculously incompetent and disorganized? What exactly is it that they do that couldn't be done just as easily by the local police force? If they're above the government, where do they get their funding? (admittedly, the answer to this may lie in Doctor Who, where it was first introduced). Why do they have a pterodactyl flying around their headquarters, and who cleans up after it? Is it just a coincidence that they're all bi-sexual or is it something to do with the rift? (I just think four out of five bi-curious characters are rather unlikely odds).<br /><br />Yet my three-star review does not mean that I think the show is bad - not by any means. The episodes, whatever else their faults, are fast-paced, well acted and built on a solid premise. There is room for much improvement, but the promise is there, and (according to general opinion) is acted upon in the second season.<br /><br />This DVD box set boasts some exceptional extras: along with the usual deleted scenes, outtakes, making of featurettes, and interviews with the cast and crew, it also has a commentary track for every single episode, something I've never seen before (usually they opt for just one or two). There's even a segment in which John Barrowman grabs hold of a microphone and belts out \\"Anything Goes\\" for a 1930s audience. The enthusiasm and care with which the cast and crew discuss the show is contagious, and it's difficult to really condemn a show that so many people obviously enjoy being a part of.

044654759X|4.0|You know you are a good author when people will buy your books right off the shelf without even reading the back cover just because it's a Nicholas Sparks book and that's exactly what I did.  I've read all the Nicholas Sparks books and have loved every single one of them including this one.  Although it is a small diversion from what he normally writes, it was entertaining and I couldn't put it down.  I think that says something brave about an author when they are willing to implement new ideas into their best-selling manuscripts.  He develops the plot and characters with the right balance of answers and intrigue.  The only thing I didn't enjoy about this book was the ending.  I felt like it was a little unrealistic and  just left me hanging and I needed more details and closure!  Overall, it was another amazing book!  I'm just sad I finished it so fast!

B002SRQ214|5.0|I have recently completed my first system build.  This CPU was my choice for my system due to price differences between Intel and AMD.  The top of the line Intel processor is at aleast three times more expensive than this AMD processor.  I use Adobe Photoshop for photo editing and have found that this processor does all that I expected it to do.  I have 8GB of RAM which helps with the editing program.  My previous computer had many problems with Photoshop, which I do not experience with this system.  I reccomend this CPU mainly for for cost concerns and also it does a great job with my photo editing chores.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|Guys, I think the beginning of this movie project was like that:  James Cameron invited some of crew to his house for a secret meeting.  James and crew start watching `Dances with Wolves' (Kevin Costner) made in 1990 while they taking drugs (perhaps marijuana).  James starts writing a NEW and ORIGINAL story for the movie which they called it `Avatar' later, while crew and of course James were high and had very colorful imagination.  They start to make an Animation, but try to represent is as a MOVIE with VERY HIGH TECH SPECIAL EFFECTS.  And then people watch the movie and think: WOW, what an original story. WOW, what a special effect. WOW, What a director. And ...  And this is end of story: the movie gets all time highest Gross revenue worldwide. (Funny but sad)  For those who want to see this movie without special effects, I recommend you guys to watch Dances with Wolves.
0393072231|5.0|Michael Lewis is a great artist with words.  But more than that, he is a great artist with explanations of a dense, complex subject that do not patronize or overly simplify what happened.  Even a layman like me could understand the main features of the mortgage crisis and the economic meltdown that ensued.  Who cannot be amazed at the stupidity of supposedly brilliant bankers and stock market analysts?  Gordon Gecko explained it all 23 years ago when he said, \\"Greed...works.\\" That was their mantra.  I like this book so much I bought additional copies for my daughters and a friend.  A MUST read.

054531058X|5.0|There's another YA series in town!<br /><br />The Hunger Games was absolutely mesmerizing.  I was completely captivated from the first sentence.  I read this book WHENEVER I could until it was finished, and I still haven't been able to stop thinking about it.  It literally blew me away.<br /><br />I am usually not one for science fiction, but the world that Suzanne Collins has created is equal parts horrifying and addicting.<br /><br />The book is told in first person narrative through the eyes of Katniss (who by the way is a great character!).  She takes her sister's place in the Hunger Games in which children are pitted against each other in a \\"fight to the death\\" arena.<br /><br />This book will not be for everyone.  It is violent, sad, and horrific.  Children are forced into a horrible circumstance and death is almost guaranteed.  Katniss's ability and will to survive are inspiring as she navigates relationships, fears, and threats from the Hunger Games.<br /><br />Read this!

Give A Little More - 4.5 stars - Definitely the catchiest and most upbeat track on the album.<br /><br />3. Stutter - 4.5 stars - This is a fun mid-tempo.<br /><br />4. Don't Know Nothing - 4.25 stars - I love this track. Slightly overproduced (what song isn't these days?) but I really love how he goes on with the lyrics in the chorus because it's addictive and it sounds like he keeps going and adding words. I guess you just have to hear it. The grooviest track thus far.<br /><br />5. Never Gonna Leave This Bed - 5 stars - This one focuses on the guitars more and I like that. At first it was ok but this is one of the few perfect tracks on the album. Adam wrote the lyrics to this song alone.<br /><br />6. I Can't Lie - 5 stars - Another relaxing track. Not quite quiet, but not energetic either. You'll probably end up loving this one too if you listen to the lyrics. They're great!<br /><br />7. Hands All Over - 4.5 stars - The title track is also the heaviest track on the album. It has a lot of bass and some simple guitar riffs, the latter quality probably being the best part of the song.<br /><br />8. How? - 5 stars  - I really like the lyrics in this one. Another perfect track, Adam confesses in it that he doesn't know much about love but that he will die trying to find out the real meaning.<br /><br />9. Get Back In My Life - 4 stars - This one is slightly odd and the way that he sings the verses, combined with the beat reminds me of Halloween. Another groovy one.<br /><br />10.  Just A Feeling - 4.25 stars - The verses are probably the album's strongest. But I'm not so sure about the repetitive chorus.<br /><br />11. Runaway - 4.25 stars - Verses are quiet and dark here, but the chorus is upbeat and groovy with drums, maracas and a bit of guitar.<br /><br />12. Out Of Goodbyes (Feat. Lady Antebellum) - 4.75 stars - The final track features the country pop female lead vocalist of Lady Antebellum. It's veeeery relaxing, has a country feel and is the most subdued, melancholy track here.<br /><br />Adam Levine and the guys have kept us waiting FOREVERRR. This will make a solid addition to anyone's Maroon 5 collection. In a way, I wish there was a bit more variety in sound because it seems like every other track is upbeat but what are you gonna do?<br /><br />All in all, a very decent CD.<br /><br />4.4 stars or a 8.8/10 (not based off of an average).<br /><br />DOWNLOAD:<br />'How?'<br />'Never Gonna Leave This Bed'<br />'Moves Like Jagger' (available on the UK import or the US re-release) &<br />'I Can't Lie'the repetitive chorus.<br /><br />11.

B0025KVLVA|5.0|The Beatles Past Masters is a must for any Beatles fan.  It has many tracks never on any Beatles album such as Rain which was recently named one of the top 500 songs of all time by Rolling Stone magazine.  Make sure you get the latest version and not the one from the 1990s as the quality is much better in this remastered version.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|The second in the Bourne trilogy, Supremacy -- like Identity before it -- is another thrilling action/suspense movie.  Continuing in a background of international intrigue and illicit conspiracy, this chapter of the Bourne saga has all the car-chasing, building blowing, head-banging, foot-stomping and butt-kicking that action movie lovers love.  And is that just mutual respect or an ever so subtle romance rising between Bourne and the young agent with whom he once worked -- the young agent whom he now must protect from the same assassins who would kill him?

0465011047|4.0|This is a thoughtful and well-detailed account of life in a gulag, told by a defector who originally was released from the prison.  I was surprised by the level of detail surrounding the daily life of a prisoner in North Korea and recommend this book if you are interested in a small but important aspect of North Korean life.    The author did not start or end the book in prison; rather, he gave the book some context by showing how he wound up in the gulag.  It is this context that is very important because the author implies that the road to the gulag can be as arbitrary and bizarre as the people who run it.  The reader learns early on that family is a core aspect of life in North Korea, and the book's development and breakdown of human bonds in prison is the work's greatest strength.    Of course, this is a memoir about a secretive country so there is little that can be done to fact-check a literary work like this one.  Even the author admits that many of the stories he heard about other people were based upon a lot of hearsay.  One could also sense the palpable hatred that the author had for the North Korean government, which is understandable given what he went through.  The painstaking level of detail in this work makes it very credible as well as informative.
B002P5XXR0|2.0|I love that soundtrack!  and  I knew it was used, so what? I buy used cds all the time. no problem!! but if I wanted to copy sound off my movie cd I would had done it and not spend money on one that has just that quality of sound.  Even at the highest volume level on my cd stereo player you cannot hear the darn thing!!  I had it turned up to the highest rating at 25 and my other cd would blast you out of the house at that volume and noone can hear this soundtrack.  I am very disappointed  and wished I didn't have to every review this company.  I just planned to never order from them again.

Starting with Kurt Cobain's Teen Spirit and ending with Plant's/Page's Kashmir, the musical crossover journey leads the listener through well-known territory of contemporary rock and classical masterpieces while opening up a whole new world of unique auditory experiences. Who else but David would dare create a competition between U2 and Vivaldi? Thank you, David, for this new evidence of your artistic talent, your sensitivity as an artist and your hard work!

B003V5PPZG|2.0|Is this the demise of the Linkin Park we all loved for over a decade? I never thought I'd see the day when I would not like an album by Linkin Park. We were so excited when we got this in the mail from Amazon. What a dissapointment! The album has a lot of good sounds that would have made great songs.  Just when you think the tune is going somewhere, it stops and goes in another direction. Its like reading the introduction to a book over and over and you never get to the plot much less a climax. The lyrics have meaningless metaphors- no feeling- no power - no nothing. The dubbed-in speeches are over-kill, and the true meaning of them is lost. Its a soundtrack for a dry TV movie that goes nowhere. Did they fire the guitar player? There are few brief licks but nothing resembling the talent he once displayed. How could he stand for this performance? I have been a loyal fan over ten years. I still havn't heard enough of their past efforts.  A few songs into this recording - I actually felt sad and embarrased for them, after a few more - I wanted my money back, and after I'd listened to the entire disc - I demand an apology.

1439181780|5.0|Rhonda Byrne's timing in publishing her latest book was perfect!  In these trying times when negativity abounds...we should all read and live \\"The Power\\"...the world would then be a wonderful place!  Thanks, Rhonda, for your beautiful book and thought provoking words.      \\"The Secret\\" changed my life.  Using the power of positive thinking, my house sold on the day I invisioned, for the amount I wanted, I was able to quit my job at a bank (Great timing there!), and move closer to my children and parents.  My future husband then 'found' me and we are now happily married and living the life I had dreamed about.  Does the Secret work???  You bet it does!  I am living proof.  All of my friends and family are amazed at how my life turned around.  It can and will for them and for you, if...when...you start to live \\"The Secret\\" and harness \\"The Power\\"!
044654759X|5.0|I really liked this book.  I'd almost given up on Nicholas Sparks because his tried and true formula for writing a novel was starting to get pretty redundant.  Boy and girl meet, fall in love, and then, in the end, either boy or girl, or a near and dear secondary character, kicks the bucket and Sparks tries as hard as he can to wring the tears out of his readers.  The death scene in 'Last Song' was especially ridiculous-though I thought the movie wasn't nearly as corny.  Anyhow, maybe it was the pretty cover, but I thought I'd give him one last chance and, low and behold, Sparks broke the mold.  This was a good novel.  It had no 'get out the hankie' scenes and the element of suspense was written well.  Someone else mentioned the ghost issue, but I thought that was a very minor thing, it didn't really add or take away from the story.  So, good for you Mr. Sparks.  Please write more like this.  As your readers, we don't need to be crying all the time!
0765350386|5.0|By far one of the better fantasy novels I've read. The characters are believable, the world is rich and layered, and the magic system Sanderson developed is unparalleled. I'm certain this series will be one I re-read many times in the years to come.

B003TML0VO|4.0|I like this new music from Carlos Santana. He is the best guitar player out there.  His musical collaborations are always interesting. I have not heard of all the artists that Carlos performs with on this disc, but I like the majority of it.<br /><br />My favorite track is \\"Sunshine Of Your Love. \\"Santana guitar riffs compliment Rob's vocals perfectly.<br /><br /> My other favorite track is the song \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\". Santana's guitar playing is soothing. India Arie's vocals are very smooth and pretty sounding here. Cello player Yo Yo Ma lends his talents here.<br /><br />  \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" is a great rock song.  Chris Cornell does an excellent job covering this song.  It has a pulsating sound.  It is a good first track that sets the tone for the disc.<br /><br /> The lead singer from Train sings the Van Halen classic \\"Dance The Night Away\\". Carlos gives this song  a fun quality with his guitar playing.<br /><br />  I have never heard of Jacoby Shaddix, but I think he does a decent job covering \\"Smoke On The Water\\".  Santana's guitar playing is actually better than Jacoby's vocals, but that is okay.<br /><br /> Pairing Santana with rapper Nas on \\"Back In Black\\" does not work for me. Carlos plays the guitar superbly, but Nas does not give a very strong vocal performance.<br /><br />  \\"Riders On The Storm\\" has a funky sound to it.  I have never heard of Chester Bennington, but he sings this song well.<br /><br />  Joe Cocker is one of my favorite singers.  He does an excellent job singing \\"Little Wing\\".  His voice always moves me.<br /><br />I like Daughtry's performance of \\"Photograph\\".<br />He sings the Def Leppard classic well with his strong rocker vocals.<br /><br />I did not care for Scott Weiland's vocals on \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\\", but the guitar playing sounds so cool here.  I forgot about Scott's vocals.<br /><br />Jonny Lang is usually a blues singer.  His track with Santana rocks though.  I love the track \\"I Aint Superstitious\\".<br /><br />This CD is not a masterpiece, but it is very fun to listen to.
1592400876|5.0|This hilarious book was printed in 2003, but just recently came to my attention.   The title is based on a joke involving a Panda who because of a missplaced comma - acts strangely.  The author is British with great journalistic talent as well as a marvelous sense of humor.  Lynne Truss  gives us examples of how bad punctuation completely changes meaning; and  apparent indifference of the populace to recognize their errors by too often memoralizing their gaffe in a permanent sign.  Lynn manages to instruct while at the same time illustrating the importance of correct punctuation.  I've always believed I was a stickler for good grammar, spelling, etc., however she is my goddess!  I find myself searching all printed matter for errors and, to my sorrow, I find plenty of them.. Also to my chagrin, you will undoubtedly find errors in my review.  Read this book!
B0021L8V1Q|3.0|I loved IRONMAN 1 and really looked forward to this sequel.  I was quite disappointed with Ironman 2.  It didn't come close to being as entertaining as the first Ironman.  Special effects were first rate ......... other than that it was a failure.
B003MZ0I84|4.0|This is the first CD I've bought in months.  I used to buy a CD every week, but most of the music coming out these days is garbage.  This is a good album by a great group.  Worth the purchase price.  A peculiar mixture of modern rock with a touch of R&B, with some tracks which have a distinct late 70's/early 80's vibe.  Different from their last album....not great, but good.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|Born to Run is a great book, despite being incredibly tangential. While I was captivated by the author's tales, I found he jumped around a little too much for my liking. Each Chapter, it seemed, moved quickly to an entirely new topic or theme. While it was highly entertaining, I feel like there were 3 different full-length stories included in this one book, as proven in the subtitle on the cover: \\"\\"A Hidden Tribe, Super Athletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen.\\" I feel like the author tried to pack too much in and at times it showed. Still a very fun read, though.
0743581601|5.0|I got this book on CD because I adore Bianca Amato who reads on the unabridged edition.  I wasn't expecting it to be so gripping,  I had no idea I was about to 'hear' one of the best stories ever!  I finished it a month ago and I am still telling anyone who will listen that they have to get it!  Even though the author seemed to be ambiguous in her wrap up of the many mysteries  I felt like i 'got' it and all my questions were answered. This book is definitely in my all time top 5 and just fills me with so much admiration for both the author and the narrators.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Of course I am a dog person...I should start with that.  I really enjoyed this book--firstly because it is sooo beautifully written, and secondly it just gripped me from beginning to end.  It is moody but stick with it.....more about humanity and love than anything else.

I am getting smaller without loosing strength. I can do that. I think its because I have more energy and keep myself busier. I do sleep alot better at night. This is something that I can live with for a lifetime.
0545310601|3.0|**SPOILERS BEWARE**    First, I must start off by saying how much I LOVED the first two books in this trilogy.  Couldn't get enough of them - devoured them within a week.  Finally, the long anticipated 3rd book...    Sadly, this one fell short for me.  It was almost as though it was a \\"sophmore slump\\" that the second book usually is, but this was the final book...so I kept reading and reading, waiting for something compelling to leap off the page.  Unfortunately, that did not happen for me.  I still liked the book because it was part of the series, but I didn't love it for the following reasons that jump out at me:    It was as though Katniss was just a follower in this book...a character who has NEVER been a follower, is just following along, ho-hum, during a war in the final book. How frustrating!  She didn't seem to be doing anything to really control her own destiny (besides killing Coin instead of Snow in the end)...things just happened to her and she went along for the ride.  Simple rule in writing-- the main character needs to solve his/her own problem.  I also thought this book was a lot more descriptive than the first two books with regard to the gore/brutality/death scenes, which I did not enjoy.  In the first two books, Collins had an artful way of writing and conveying an image without being overly gory, which I feel is a true talent.  This time it was overly descriptive and I missed her former writing style in that regard.      Also, something that was somewhat insignificant, albeit preachy, that bothered me was early on...page 84 where she writes, \\"Frankly, our ancestors don't seem much to brag about.  I mean, look at the state they left us in, with the wars and the broken planet.  Clearly, they didn't care about what would happen to the people who came after them.\\"  Hmm...being preachy about WAR when you've written a book about WAR?   Another simple rule in writing - Don't get preachy with your reader (even if it's ONLY 3 sentences which should have been marked out by the editor's pen).      Now, on to the Gale/Peeta issue.  I feel like Katniss ended up with Peeta just by pure coincidence...kind of like \\"Oh well, Gale is in District 2 so I guess I'm stuck with Peeta instead\\".  SHE didn't make that decision, it was made FOR her because Gale was gone.  I wasn't convinced she would have chosen Peeta anyway.    I think more should have been written about Katniss' thought process surrounding her \\"YES\\" vote for a Hunger Games with Capital family members.  I hated her for that vote...what was she thinking??  See, if Collins had truly put more effort into her main character in this book, I wouldn't HAVE to ask \\"what was she thinking\\" because I would have read it and therefore already known - I would have FELT what Katniss was thinking.      I was heartbroken when Prim died, but it was written in such a confusing fashion that at first, I didn't know for sure if it happened or not.  I had to re-read that part a couple times.  I thought that the last few chapters were somewhat muddled - I had a hard time understanding if it was real or just a dream.  They felt rushed.  I really broke down when Prim's cat came home and Katniss was finally allowing herself to feel the pain of her sister's death.    I so wanted to LOVE this book.  It really makes me wish there could be a \\"do over\\" in literature.  It will be interesting how it plays out on the big screen.
B003VQM2M4|3.0|2007's Grinderman, a side project of Nick Cave and three Bad Seeds members, found Cave largely revisiting his pre-Seeds punk side. This follow-up mostly continues in that vein, which also spilled into Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!!, the most recent Seeds release, leading one to wonder if it is a long-term or even permanent shift. We can only hope not. Grinderman's unabashed garage rock was inherently limited but fine for a one-off side project; three albums is certainly too much. The discerning can only wonder if it is Cave and company, not the sex victim of \\"Mickey Mouse and the Goodbye Man,\\" who have been sucked dry. Limited as Grinderman was, it overflowed with creativity; the musicians were clearly having great fun, and the deliberate sound worked their muses in a way that almost certainly would not have been possible otherwise. Here, the path of liberation has become almost a dead end, Grinderman turning out pseudo-garage rock not because it is thrillingly different but because they can no longer do anything else. The album largely shares Grinderman's limitations, but they stand out because the novelty has worn off. For instance, a prior highlight was Cave's electric guitar playing; novelty aside, he had an undisciplined, what-the-hell style that charmed in a way similar to Neil Young's. Here, his lack of real skill is apparent; he is loud, but that is about it, lacking real riffs and solos, much less melodies. Nearly the whole album indeed suffers from lack of melody; one might say this is par for the punk course, but that hardly makes the album easier to hear. The songs also sound too similar; most of the album could be one long work that loses interest quickly. Grinderman's determination to sound as unlike the Seeds as possible has at least lessened slightly, to the album's betterment. Those wanting that band's strengths - beautiful piano, majestic vocal harmonies, soaring violin, etc. - will still miss them, but we can at least hear real violin for a short time. TheSeeds' thrash side - noisy guitars, pounding drums, screaming vocals - is of course played up but simply becomes boring, if not numbing, without the contrast. This is not to say the album lacks slower cuts, but they are without drama or anything else to intrigue, making them additional dead weight. As on recent work, the main culprit is the bandleader; contrary to popular belief, Cave is a great singer - even in a traditional sense -, but no one would know it from this. He essentially alternates between talking and screaming without melody, emotion, or vitality. His lyrics are again also very subpar; the first album's minimalism has thankfully been expanded but is sadly replaced with something nearly self-parodical. \\"Kitchenette\\" would seem to be someone mocking Cave and should make long-time fans feel sad, but the artless bareness of \\"What I Know\\" almost makes it preferable. There are at least two bright spots:  \\"Kitchenette\\" (despite the words) and \\"Palaces of Montezuma.\\" Notably more ambitious than anything on Grinderman, they are relatively polished and melodic, sounding like actual finished works. Two songs out of nine is of course not good enough to atone, but they at least help somewhat. All told, only those who liked the first album or the Seeds' thrashier side need apply.
0307592839|4.0|A VISIT FROM THE GOON SQUAD is a novel in linked stories about a punk-rock record producer, his assistant, and their families, friends and colleagues as they grow (and decline) from who they were to who they are and who they'll be. Think of it as a montage -- a soundtrack album, each of its stories (songs) memorializing key aspects of a larger saga.    And then Egan puts those key bits into a blender and they come out zigzagging between the 1980s and a dystopian 2020s; between San Francisco, New York City, Africa, and Italy; through various characters, tenses, points of view and narrative forms (including a magazine article with footnotes evocative of David Foster Wallace, and a 12-year-old's slide presentation that's nearly graphic-novel format). The structure borders on distracting, but it's also very fun and the stories are good -- the most extensively (and effectively) linked collection I've read yet.
B000EOTAM6|5.0|I am a Sci-Fi fan (particularly Babylon 5). Being from an older generation I've never watched MTV animated shows, so comparing the movie to its origins would be irrelevent. On its own merits it's an absorbing, entertaining wild ride. The plot manages to be original and the production values are all top notch. Being a romantic I was especially pleased by the relationship between the lead characters. The theme of the movie at heart is a morality play and designed to provoke contemplation and discussion of serious societal issues. This might be tough on some younger viewers who prefer action or sex or both, and don't really want to consider larger issues in their trip to the theater. The movie has a powerful message regarding the abuse of power and the danger of losing our liberties. Don't miss it.
B003MZ0I84|4.0|Maroon 5 return with their new album produced by the one and only Mutt Lange and it's a funky tour de force of pop tunes with plenty of production magic sprinkled all over the place. The album sounds spectacular thanks to the awesome skills of Mutt Lange and it seems he has pushed Maroon 5 to achieve the best they are capable of in the studio. The songwriting is just a little patchy in some places but overall this is a very high quality collection of pop music with influences ranging from Prince to Michael Jackson to Motown style. Adam Levine continues to be the main attraction with his irresistable vocal hooks and melodic style. Highlights include the intense groove of \\"Give A Little More\\", the guitar heavy \\"Hands All Over\\", the infectious \\"Get Back In My Life\\", and the mesmerising ballad \\"Just A Feeling\\". Highly recommended to fans of polished pop music - and look at that awesome album cover!

It's great at any time of year, if you love light romantic comedies with implausible twists and turns in plot to drive it along. However, at the risk of over-analyzing the premise of a comedy, I have to deduct one star from Serendipity. Of course, the lovers must overcome obstacles. But, did they have to create the obstacle, themselves? Does it have to be all that implausible?<br /><br />Well, as silly as it is, Serendipity still has that certain something to make me watch it again and again. I guess it's just destiny. Sigh...

Zachary Levi was charming which lead me and my husband to watch Chuck.  We both Loved Adam's character Casey in Chuck so we began to watch Firefly together.  I think I did a marathon watching of it the 1st time in 2 days.  Have since watched it a 2nd time and the movie 3x.  Have gotten multiple friends and family to watch it and am having a Firefly marathon introduction to my family during thanksgiving.  Loved Nathan Fillion in it so went and watched Castle (also a great show AND in the 2nd season they have him dress up as Capt. Mal for Halloween, i DIED!  GREAT show highly recommend!
0393072231|5.0|A well written and captivating story. We get to review a disaster through the experiences of those oddballs and misfits who correctly figured out how all of us got screwed and got very rich in the process (good for them!).  This book is especially good reading if your blood pressure is too low or you have an overwhelming need to hate somebody.  The cupidity, ignorance, arrogance,stupidity and venality of the people who brought down our financial system to its lowest level in 80 years is depressingly eye opening.  It is simply hard to believe that so many of our important business, governmental and political organizations are populated with so many genius sociopaths.  I strongly recommend that every thinking citizen read the book.  Until you do you may think that what happened was very bad but fixable, but you would be wrong--it is much worse, our financial system was and is seriously flawed always anywhere and everywhere!!
B000PDYVVG|2.0|I have read about six chapters and have decided not to force myself to read the rest.  The author is not the kind of person I can relate to or respect.  She is obviously spoiled and selfish.  She goes on about how unsatisfied and unhappy she is with her life.  Next, she had no problem leaving her husband to jump into a live-in relationship with her lover while still married.  And, of course... we had to hear how broken up and lost she was when that fell apart.  I could not believe it when that happened....not. The next surprise was that after her selfish husband took all her assets, she gets to travel to India, Indonesia and Italy...all to discover WHO SHE IS, while writing a book for her job.  What a lot of crap.  The sad part is that now she's making a boat load of money on the book and movie.  Luckily, I did not pay for the book because a friend loaned it to me.  Please don't waste your time or money.
B00406UK5A|4.0|I am a fan of Marshall's work, so my impressions may be clouded. And yup, I enjoyed the heck out of Doomsday as well. ;)    The cinematography, first off, was outstanding. They did an aces job of getting the feel of the period, while showing off the beautiful landscape.    Battle scenes, as expected, were full of gore and the red stuff. Like the sound of that? It should be enough to keep you entertained.    Story. Well, it had its moments, but this is an action/chase/escape film, so you are going to see more of a Classical Hollywood Cinema story approach rather than something that will blow you away. I for one, thought it was adequate, even though there were some holes. Not a huge deal considering how well the other aspects balanced this out into a very watchable and entertaining film.    Acting. Good, sometimes great. Loved the script! Michael Fassbender (300, Inglorious Basterds) was fantastic!    4/5 here, 8.5/10 for me. I saw this last week on Comcast OnDemand. I pre-ordered the blu ray today.

B003QCCS3Q|4.0|This is a very, very good LP.  I listened to it when it was streaming on-line many times.

Does anyone know what the deal is on this?<br /><br />Thanks.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I really like this show. Nathan Fillion plays Richard Castle, crime novelist par excellence, who, in his search for new material, gets himself permanently attached (practically at the hip) to NYPD Detective Kate Becket (Stana Katic); in true Holmes and Watson mode, they go around solving crimes.<br /><br />Castle, with his mystery writer's background, often contributes mightily to the crime solving, AND he makes Becket famous as \\"Nikki Heat,\\" his latest literary creation.<br /><br />Becket's of two minds about this. At first, she resents having to sheepdog Castle, but as the first season progresses they bond. She also enjoys her notoriety as Nikki Heat, but it sometimes becomes a burden. Her superiors expect her to close every case she gets. She becomes a folk hero to Castle's fans, and a target to the lunatic fringe. Katic, running armed down an alleyway in black jeans is why they invented DVR!<br /><br />Castle, for his part, enjoys the sleuthing, and its obvious he loves both the character of Nikki Heat and her inspiration, whom he very much also admires. Although Castle the bestselling author is sometimes impenetrable to others, he is a warm, funny man who loves his High School-aged daughter and his in-residence mother.<br /><br />The handsome Fillion and the beautiful Katic have a wonderful chemistry onscreen, and I hope this New York-based show lasts many seasons, especially since those NBC boneheads decided to tank LAW & ORDER. The only real downside to CASTLE is that it is a near-clone of BONES, another of my favorite few shows (HOUSE is the third; the rest are in re-runs).<br /><br />Hopefully, the viewership won't tire of two intelligently-written shows brimming with drama and humor, fueled by the sexual tension in a smart, witty partnership between two good-looking people, one male and one female. You know, I don't think they will tire of it. I know I won't.
B002ZG99N6|4.0|\\"The Town\\" is a perfectly adequate crime drama, although it isn't the compelling masterpiece that director, co-writer, and star Ben Affleck was in all likelihood hoping it would be. Perhaps he was too focused on the crime and not focused enough on the drama. Consider the final shootout scene, which in itself is an overused convention; it doesn't quite become boring, but it definitely goes on longer than it should. Watching it, I was well aware of its technical merits, but at the same time, I was disappointed that it wasn't giving me anything I haven't already seen many times before. This is by no means a bad movie. Far from it - the story is both suspenseful and heartfelt, most of the characters are wonderfully developed, and its raw, gritty look effectively establishes mood. I was just hoping for a film that reached a little higher.    Adapted from Chuck Hogan's novel \\"Prince of Thieves,\\" \\"The Town\\" is set in Charlestown, Massachusetts, an area of Boston that has the dubious distinction of being the bank robbery capital of the world. We meet career criminals Doug MacRay (Affleck), Jem Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Albert Magloan (Slaine), and Desmond Elden (Owen Burke) as they pull off yet another heist, guns in hand and concealed by Halloween masks. The bank manager, Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall), is taken hostage by Jem after the silent alarm is tripped, although she's let go after they escape. Fearing she will go to the cops after discovering she lives within proximity of Albert, Jem decides to confront her. Doug, aware that Jem is a bit unstable and capable of making the situation worse, volunteers himself for the job.    And so, as casually as can be, he enters her life, strikes up a friendship, and then - you guessed it - falls in love with her. He stealthily asks her a number of questions relating to the robbery, trying to see how much she knows and whether or not she's likely to squeal. As it turns out, she did notice something about one of the robbers: A fighting Irish tattoo on the back of his neck. She was noticing Jem. In a contrived but nonetheless carefully crafted scene, Jem suddenly joins Doug and Claire as they eat lunch outdoors; Doug is careful to keep Jem's neck out of Claire's sight, even going so far as to feign a hug as he gets up to leave. Having just described this scene, I realize that there's no way to really convey the tension. One must see the film in order to feel the suspense.    Keeping tabs on Doug and his gang is a ruthless FBI agent named Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm), all threatening words and intimidating poses. It's strange - Hamm's performance is about as decent as anyone could hope for, and yet something about his presence in this film doesn't register with me. He didn't seem credible in the role. Perhaps he's too refined for a character so hard boiled, so rough around the edges, so gruff and unpleasant. There's a scene, for example, in which he interrogates Jem's sister and Doug's ex-girlfriend, Krista (Blake Lively), the drug-addicted single mom; his words are stern and insensitive, and yet his expression exhibits nothing but calm and caring, as if he genuinely wanted to help this woman. Either this character was supposed to be a contradiction, or Hamm was both miscast and misdirected. Whatever the case, it doesn't play as well as it should.    Other subplots weave their way into the story. One involves Doug's incarcerated father (Chris Cooper), who's unwilling to help his son find closure over the disappearance of his mother years earlier. Doug would like to believe that she retreated to Florida, where he was told she had relatives. Another involves Irish crime boss Fergie the Florist (Pete Postlethwaite), who sets up one last job for Doug and his gang at Fenway Park. Doug, as would be expected in a movie like this, feels so strongly for Claire that he no longer wants to be a career criminal. Fergie, in his own nasty and cold-hearted way, insists that Doug take part. How it plays out I leave for you to find out. I will say that, given everything that happened up to that point, the ending isn't all that surprising.    I'm sorry to say that I missed Ben Affleck's previous directorial effort, \\"Gone Baby Gone.\\" But on the basis of this film, it's obvious that he knows what he's doing behind the camera. He also knows how to write, or at least co-write, a screenplay, and we need no further proof of this than the Best Original Screenplay Oscar he earned along with Matt Damon for \\"Good Will Hunting.\\" The long and short of it is, \\"The Town\\" is a perfectly competent film. My hope is that Affleck will strive for something grander in the future. The film goes through the motions, which is to say that it gets the job done but fails to reach for anything beyond the conventions of typical crime dramas. Considering all the hype generated by the studios, considering the talent involved, can you blame me for wishing someone had tried a little harder?
B003W5C0VM|5.0|There is no better concert film in my opinion. The release of this on blu-ray is a monumental event -- so many of us have been getting by with bootleg transfers of this seminal footage for so many years. Cause to celebrate if ever there was one. If you don't like the Stones, why are you reading this? If you do like the Stones and have not seen this (or attended an actual show on this tour), you do not truly know the Stones. I am buying a blu-ray player just for this.

B0036EH3WK|5.0|I greatly enjoyed the opportunity to update all of my DVD's to Blu-ray quality. This should be very enjoyable for all fans of the series great or small. If you have only an interest in watching the seasons for fun it is well worth the money. If you are the type of person already deeply interested in the myth of the show though it is well worth it for the simple fact that there are some answers to mysteries of the series that can only be found in this box! I would highly recommend this for anybody. My only complaint is that for some unknown reason Season 3 has been left completely untouched, being the only season not to include the season play feature or even the switch that all the other seasons made from the Buena Vista intro to the ABC intro.
0312600844|5.0|This book is incredibly good and wonderfully human.  Franzen takes a family, the Berglunds, some friends and sometimes enemies and some extended family members and runs with it.  Everyone in the book is flawed, some in very fundamental ways.  Everyone makes incredibly stupid, self-serving mistakes.  Just about everyone hurts and betrays other people.  Yet, for it all, each of these people are worth something and there is something redeemable about every single character in the book.  Sometimes you want to pick Walter up and shake him about his stupidity in selling out to the mountain-top removers in return for the promise of a bird sanctuary.  Sometimes you want to scream at his wife, Patty about her docility with Walter and her betrayal of him with his best friend.  But everyone -- Walter, the best friend, the children, Patty, their neighbors, the angry people who sell their land in the mountains for a sterile fortune -- has something to say.  In short these are fundamentally well-meaning people who mess up a lot.  Just like you and me and everyone we know.  It is to Franzen's credit that he makes this interesting, in turns funny, in turns horrifying.  Sometimes it is both, as with Walter and Patty's son Joey who buys up decrepit 1985 Polish truck parts to sell to the US forces in Iraq.  I couldn't put it down.  I understand that there isn't a lot of action here, but there is a lot of insight.  This is one of the best books I've read in years.  I highly recommend it.
B003IKMR0U|4.0|Zombies rarely speak, but when they do, they typically only have one word in their vocabulary. Saying it like they do (\\"BraAAaAaaAaains\\") had us giggling throughout the games.  Each player gets a turn with the dice (like Yahtzee) but what a player does with his turn is more exciting for everyone else to watch.  The dice have brains, footprints, and gunshot bursts on them.  4 yellow dice have 2 of each symbol, 3 red and 6 green dice have two footprints each, with red having 3 gunshots and 1 brain, and green having the 3 brains and 1 gunshot.     You blindly take 3 dice and roll them.  You keep your brains to your left, your gunshots to your right, and your footprints in the middle. As long as you haven't been shot 3 times, you can choose between rolling again, or eating (scoring) your brains and passing your turn.  If you roll again, you must roll your footprint dice again, plus however many new dice you need to blindly pull from the cup to total 3. If you roll that 3rd gunshot, your turn is over and you don't get to eat your braaaAAAaains! Play continues in a race to 13 brains; once someone gets to 13, remaining players complete the current round and the zombie who ate the most brains wins.     Its the same 13 dice every turn, but turns go in a surprising variety of ways.  Red footprints are going to have to be rolled again, which is scary, but even a red gunshot is a red die that isn't in the cup anymore - you could try to calculate the probabilities for your next throw, but in the end, you find a balance between your innate mathematical intuitions, the pressures of the current game score, and whatever sense of luck you possess.  It's exciting, like gambling, and you are more engaged in your own risk/reward strategy (BraaaaAAaaaAAainnnns!) than with Yahtzee's more relaxed laundry list of things to accomplish.      There were no youngsters in my play groups, but I think kids would get this game, and older players can certainly offer helpful advice, so I think thereis an educational vector here - its a fun way to exercise the probabilistic thinking muscles. But this is also a game you can introduce people into quickly, play once, and then play again, or do something else. Folks can easily rotate in and out of play.      For 2 players, 13 brains takes 5-15 minutes - additional players make the rounds longer, but the race to 13 seems to go faster too.      The \\"cup\\" is a stiff cardboard tube covered with the product art, with plastic caps on both ends -  both come off, which is unfortunate when a zealous shaking pops the bottom off and sends 13 dice in all directions... if you are only a little more intelligent than I, you can avoid that problem. Sturdy black dice with recessed images painted in bright, unmistakable green, red, and yellow, and a succinct rules sheet that folds and fits in the tube complete the product. Its smaller than a beer can so you could take and play anywhere.  (Tip: bring/find a little tray to toss the dice into, pass it with the dice cup)    This is a good dice game without the zombie motif. It's fast, engaging, and it can get exciting.  If you embrace the whole zombie genre, it can get hilarious too. 2 to any number of players, I guess.  Ages 9 to 99, I think.     BraaAAaAaainnNNsssS!
B002LS4M9E|5.0|I just bought this album. Like... 15 minutes ago. Thing is, I was using this application on my toolbar called \\"StumbleUpon\\". As I was doing my boring usual stumble across the internet, this video on Mayer popped up. The music playing in the background absolutely caught my attention.   You see, I'm addicted to different types of music. Lately it's been things such as Bright Eyes and The Arctic Monkeys. But even they have their roots set in some sort of soul background. As I watched this little video, I fell in love with the soul version of Rivers Cuomo. So, maybe my bias of loving thick framed boys with musical talents took over, but my first instinct was to buy this album.     So about 3 seconds later I was here buying the album. Instantly I've listened to the album, and I find nothing wrong with it. I'm astounded by how \\"on the dot\\" the music is.... Without the grittiness of a record playing, it's absolutely well constructed and simple.   Simple is what we need in life and music right now. Simple lyrics, straightforward and classy, simple notes, not intricate like the screamo bands we see with their guitar solos, and simplicity in emotion, very optimistic and uplifting.     I see lots of things happening for Mayer. I absolutely love it. And maybe it's not authentically \\"soul\\" because Mo-town isn't what's all hot right now, but honestly, its something I can just dance around my living room too. Even if you're not in love in real life, this album makes you fall in love with being a daydreamer all over again. :)
B003V5PPZG|2.0|A thousand yikes.  This sounds more like Enya than LP.  What a disappointment.  Sure, bands evolve.  But this is a major sell-out.  Hope they get big bucks for the inevitable CSI: Miami episode.  It sure seems that was their goal in recording this thing.

In my opinion the only part of the movie that truly excited me was the scene with the suitcase suit.

044654759X|5.0|Nicholas Sparks' latest love story, SAFE HAVEN, is easily one of the best he's written. His fans will love it.<br /><br />Katie has moved to a small town on the east coast, where she is looking for a new start. She's scraping by, barely making ends meet as a waitress. Alex is a prematurely gray haird, ex-Army officer, who runs the general store while raising his two young children after his wife died. Standard sparks stuff, of course. The novel is set apart by the Katie's past. Once she tells her story midway through the novel, you'll be rooting even more for her. Carly, Alex's deceased wife, provides a powerful emotional punch not found in other Sparks novels.<br /><br />Of course, the novel has the standard Sparks writing problems. He's often too wordy, and the use of up to three character point of views over the span of a couple paragraphs can confuse the reader. But, Sparks isn't going to change. Why should he with the success he's had.<br /><br />SAFE HAVEN is a powerful novel from Sparks. The man in Katie's past and his descent into obsession is truly terrifying and frightenly realistic. Supporting character Jo turns in a few great moments herself. It is one his fans will enjoy and it will make a great movie some day.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|Will it sharpen your knife? Yes. (A Caveat is coming) BUT, take a close look at the blade's edge and you will see that it eats into the blade causing tiny saw like indentions. DO NOT USE THIS TOOL ON PROFESSIONAL COOKING KNIVES, such as F.Dick Co. It will destroy the edge. This is a good field tool when nothing else will do, sure it gets the blade sharp and in the field that's great. Good for cheap knives.
B003WKFAIW|5.0|I have been listing to this for a week since it was released on Maroon 5's My Space page and I just can't get enough of it. It is upbeat and funky overall. I think it is their best release yet. I wish I could write great reviews because this deserves one, but alas I don't seem to have the knack for it.  My favorites are 'Give A Little More', 'Get Back In My Life', 'Runaway', 'Never Gonna Leave', and 'Stutter'. The duet 'Out Of Goodbyes' With Lady Antebellum is lovely. I don't think there is a dud anywhere on this album.
B003XQRZ7E|4.0|After several listens through the album, it keeps on getting better. Many of the songs take a while to develop, so be patient. Not sure what the album was going to sound like with all the different influences, but I am very pleased. Personally, I would have liked more vocals from Joe Bonamassa instead of Glenn Hughes, but all the music is very tight. \\"Down Again\\", \\"Song Of Yesterday\\" and \\"Sista Jane\\" are my favorite tracks.    Chickenfoot was the latest super group formed in the rock genre that I can compare to. Black County Communion is far better than Chickenfoot! I'm not taking anything away from Satriani and crew, but the Chickenfoot album came across as bland and that so much more could have been done with the musicians involved. Black Country is much tighter musically and the album doesn't run out of gas.    Great job for the debut album!
143911000X|5.0|Huge fans of How I Met Your Mother, my boyfriend and I laughed out loud when reading The Bro Code. A definite must for fans!
054531058X|4.0|I'm a 47 year old woman, and this type of book would have been unforgettable to me - when I was a kid.  I remember how \\"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\\", \\"Lord of the Flies\\", \\"Call of the Wild\\", and \\"Boy Caruso's\\", (if anyone knows where I can find a copy of the latter, please let me know) affected me back then.  I believe this one would have also left a lasting impression on my memory.  I'm drawn towards adventure romance books, and this one certainly has all the makings of those two elements.  Unfortunately as an adult, I found quite a few things keeping this book just short of a 5 for me.  And of course they are only derived from my own experience in life, and completely of my own opinion.  But I'd be curious to know if any of you had thoughts similar to mine.    SPOILER ALERT:  I really enjoyed the set up.  It was wonderfully executed, and made me simply itch to get into the games.  I couldn't wait to see how Katniss would use her skills to survive.  And I was just as excited to see how the romance would play out between her and Peeta.  Especially with Gale at home, waiting in the wings, watching their relationship develop.  All the time loving her, wanting her to make it home, but jealous as all heck - at the thought of her heart bonding with Peeta's instead of his own.  Was she simply pretending, as a strategy to win the game?  Or was she truly falling for Peeta in their desperate fight for survival?  I would have liked to hear more from Gale's perspective.  Oooooh - the entrails of a love triangle!    O.k., so we get to the games... and her first real plight of survival - is that she doesn't have any water?  Surely I'm not the only one who thought.... Why don't you use your piece of plastic, and the concept of condensation, to collect water?  Warm days, and cold nights.  Has no one but me noticed the amount of condensation that collects on grass overnight, in that kind of weather?  Hmmm..... She could have gotten enough to at least wet her whistle..... just a thought I had.  On top of which, she had both run and walked for almost three days, I can't imagine her not coming across water by then.  The river she ended up utilizing, was much closer than a three day hike to the cornucopia.    I loved the pairing with Rue, and Rue being compared to Prim.  But during the whole course of the games, Katniss never once had to really make a tough decision when it came to killing for her survival.  When you think about it, everything worked out perfectly in her favor so she never had to deal with that kind of a choice.  It's not so tough to kill the bad guys, but the good guys?  That's a whole part of the story that was conveniently left out. That's what makes fabulous debate..... the tough choices, the pro's, cons, rights, wrongs, moral dilemma's versus desire to survive - all mixed in.  I would have liked to see the author tackle that during the course of the story.    Katniss is beyond her years in maturity, being that she had to step in as adult and provider - just to keep her family alive over the years.  But when it came to the workings of her mind, on the subject of marriage and relationships, it just didn't make sense.  Surely I'm not the only one who would agree, that bringing children into that world would almost seem cruel.  But I'm sure Katniss could have been written with enough intelligence, to realize that partnering with someone would be much more advantageous; than being alone for the whole of your existence, in their dire circumstances.  Children are a choice, well... unless they withheld birth control from this particular district.  And religious factors were never mentioned.  It would have been good for Prim to have a strong, loving, \\"boy/man\\" figure in her life too, after her father's death at so young an age.  Not to mention, the only thing of meaning/value they had to cling to in this futuristic setting, were the people they loved.  So why stay alone purposefully?    I believe this story could have been made into an even more wonderful tool for discussion. Still, I can see why teachers are requesting their students to read it.  In a society where reality t.v. is such popular entertainment, and so many of our systems are becoming Government run, one could have a field day as to where that may be headed next....  I don't find this story to be beyond the realm of possibility.  Although, the mutants they created for the games at the very end - I felt unrealistic.  I mean really?  Did they have magic in the Capitol?  Dead - to mutant creature overnight?  Not to mention, Katniss had already led us to believe that the dead were immediately shipped back home in a simple wooden box.  Hmmmmmmm......  I loved Collins' other creatures... like the mockingjays and the tracker jackets...awesome, and believable creations.     We all have our self predicated desires and wishes, for how a story could be made better, but over all I enjoyed this one.  As a parent myself, I would recommend it for family reading and discussion around the dinner table.

0545310601|3.0|I put some serious thought into that rating.  The first book was, quite simply, amazing.  The plotting was perfect as was the character development.  As the series progresses, the plot seems to get away from the author a little and, maybe due to the limited first person viewpoint, we see a bit less of what's really going on.  Much deduction is required, at times frustratingly so due to Katniss's rather pointed feelings one way or another.<br /><br />What Mockingjay lacks is the shock and awe factor of the first two.  The length of the book becomes a little daunting after a while since all we're seeing is war, war, war.  However, part of the point of the series seems to be that war kills and people are corrupt and even the best and the brightest of us have to make sacrifices or be sacrificed.  That point is put home brilliantly by the end when Collins makes some tough choices getting rid of or alienating certain key and very loved characters.  Katniss's decisions are well-thought through, but not always correct and we start to see that she is as much at fault as anyone else including Presidents Coin and Snow.<br /><br />The love triangle of Gale-Katniss-Peeta is awkward and awful at times, occasionally alarmingly so.  And Katniss almost seems to purposely cut herself off from those important to her only to want them back at times of great need.  This is not so much suprising given the nature of the book and its message about war, but we do see a young girl faced with hard decisions in every facet of life.  Her weird love triangle is balanced nicely by her relationship with Finnick and the new addition Boggs who is about the most even headed character present in the series and is instantly likeable not just from Katniss's perspective but because of his constant calming and logical presence.<br /><br />So, while this third and final entry of The Hunger Games is not nearly up to par in some ways with the first book, it is still a solid finisher.  When writing, making the tough choices seem to have a bigger payoff in the end even if it separates the author from some of the core readers.  I wanted one or two things to happen differently, but I can appreciate that the propaganda machine that is The Hunger Games is an important part of the final product.  Because of that, I cannot fault Suzanne Collins for making some of the decisions she makes, because, in the end, they do seem to be the right from Katniss's perspective, and I would hate to see the series end in the popular way and not with the author's original vision for this groundbreaking trilogy.  Hence, a solid three.have a bigger payoff in the end even if it separates the author from some of the core readers.

B003YOMNCM|5.0|I would normally only talk in a review about my visceral observations of the performance as the Classical piece being played is often well known. This is surely true of the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto.  However, since the Higdon Violin Concerto is enjoying its premier recording on this CD, it may be necessary for me to break my own rule this once.<br /> The Higdon Concerto is done on a grand scale.  It is modern in style (meaning you aren't going to be whistling it anywhere) but its subtle melodies are never obscured by the type of ugly discordance found in much of the non-romantic modern repertoire.  The piece has a tremendous amount of power and energy that brought me many a smile on my initial hearing.<br /> I also must say that if I did not have a hearing aid I would surely not have heard most of the beginning of the first movement as it is full of harmonics way above my age-onset hearing loss.  The third movement is exciting, played at a breakneck pace that may have been inspired by Miss Hahn's performance of the Barber third movement.  Jennifer Higdon was right when she said that it sounds like Miss Hahn plays the third movement of her (Higdon's) concerto as if she had six fingers! As for its beauty, you can judge for yourself.  Music is felt in the soul and many parts of this piece touched mine.<br /> As for Hilary Hahn's performance of both pieces she is in typically amazing form.  The phrasing, tonality and technique in these pieces are  flawless and inspiring.  She has the refreshing ability to put the music above her virtuosity and turn the technically monstrous passages into beautiful and graceful compliments to the spirit of the piece she is playing.<br /> Many have commented that the Violin in Tchaikovsky's concerto was not written in a \\"violinistic\\" fashion.  Miss Hahn proves them wrong and then some.  What a wonderfully different listen this concerto is to the many interpretations I have heard over the years.  She chose to play the original Tchaikovsky score rather than the Leopold Auer version so often used in the general repertoire (possibly for the criticisms mentioned at the start of this paragraph).  I think her interpretation may inspire future violinist to consider the composers version of this piece as she points sign-posts in a fascinating and beautiful direction.<br /> For the low price of this cd on Amazon, it would be a shame not to own it.  The Tchaikovsky alone is worth the price of admission!score rather than the Leopold Auer version so often used in the general repertoire (possibly for the criticisms mentioned at the start of this paragraph).

0802473156|3.0|It's a quick read with concepts that are easy to grasp.  Most of the book is common sense, but sometimes the right words to describe something elude us and I think he does a great job of providing those easily communicated words.  I do, however, find the book a bit redundant and some of the examples are just a little too pat...they end too neatly with everyone riding off into the sunset with happy marriages after a few words...and I'm sure that's hardly the case.  Overall, I enjoyed it.
0385335989|4.0|This is the fourth in Gabaldon's \\"Outlander\\" series.  The Frasier family all ends up in \\"the colonies\\" in pre-revolutionary days.      I have good and bad feelings about this book.  I am totally caught up in the series and intend to finish it--eventually--through the 6th book (each book runs around 1,000 pages).  But this wasn't one of the best.  It dragged terribly in spots.      One of Gabaldon's strong points is her ability to paint a picture with words...you see, smell and hear the time and place that she is describing.  But by the same token, sometimes you just don't care about the bloody smell of the wood or the sound of the birds or the feel of crisp leaves under the foot, when you're desperate to find out what's going to happen next in the story.      Also, Brianna Randall-Frasier takes a large part of this story.   There is a long part of the book where I wanted to slap her for being such a whiny ninny.  But overall, this was another page-turner in the saga of the time-traveling Frasier family.
B000P0J09C|5.0|Kubrick brings in a legendary Vietnam War film in his own special way.  In two parts he highlights two victims and their revenge against the warriors. In the first half, a chubby Marine recruit endures horrific mental and verbal abuse in basic training until he collapses in violence.  In the second half, a young female Vietnamese woman is used by American Maries as a sex object until she also emerges as a violent opponent. In both stories, the hapless victims become avengers and find strength bearing a Full Metal Jacket. A stunning often underrated film.
B001F7MSFM|3.0|Hellboy 2: The Golden Army (Guillermo del Toro, 2008)<br /><br />Guillermo del Toro is one of those guys who throws a monkeywrench into everything. At first I figured he was your basic foreign director: making movies at home that are simply fantastic, being recruited by Hollywood, and then turning out stuff here that's entirely leached of the aspects that make his foreign films so great. And it was the usual formula for a while; he made Cronos at home and Mimic in Hollywood, went home and made The Devil's Backbone, came back and made Blade II. And then came the monkeywrench... Hellboy. del Toro once again teamed up with Ron Perlman, who was so phenomenal in Cronos (and the only thing about Blade II of worth), and came up with one of the best comic book superhero adaptations of the last two decades. (Then he went home and made Pan's Labyrinth, and damn if that wasn't a game-changer.) Inevitably, because it's Hollywood, a successful comic-book movie had to have a sequel, and so along came The Golden Army. Surprisingly, they got this one right, too, with the relevant cast and crew coming back, a bigger budget, and the same sense of stupid fun that made the first movie so good.<br /><br />We start off with a flashback to Professor Broom (John Hurt) reading the fable of the Golden Army to Hellboy as a child. Fast-forward to present, and the Kingdom of the Elves, who built the Golden Army, is in turmoil. King Balor (Roy Dotrice, from the highly-anticipated A Game of Thrones adaptation), who originally negotiated a treaty with humanity to never unleash the Golden Army, is grown old and feeble, and while his daughter Nuala (Crusoe's Anna Walton) is right there with him on that, his son Nuada (Blade II's Luke Goss) is disgusted with what the humans have done to the earth. He unofficially declared war on them, in fact, by blasting his way into a New York City auction house where a piece of the crown used to control the Golden Army was being auctioned off. Part of the treaty involved the splitting up of the crown; one piece went to the humans, while the elves kept two. Now Nuada has the human piece, and needs to get the others from his dad. Where does Hellboy (Perlman) fit into all of this? Well, when he's not fighting with his girlfriend Liz (Kath & Kim's Selma Blair), the two of them, along with old pal Abe Sapien (del Toro regular Doug Jones), and their human handler Manning (Jeffrey Tambor), do things like investigate auction houses where elves come and slaughter people in order to get back a piece of crown. As it usually is with Hellboy, the investigation is a comeplete cock-up, and the government sends in a new guy to head up the department, Johann Krauss (played at various times by Layer Cake's James Dodd and Men in Black II's John Alexander, but voiced by Seth MacFarlane of Family Guy fame). Given Hellboy's entrance into this world, he's not too happy with Germans, as a rule...<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong, this is not as good a movie as Hellboy. it suffers from pacing problems, it dwells a bit much on the soap-opera aspects of the relationship between Hellboy and Liz (though rest assured this does become germane to the plot), and it could have used a slightly more zealous editor; it runs maybe ten minutes longer than it should. And I know there are quite a few fans of the first film in the franchise who hated this one, but I can't quite imagine why. Yes, there's a bunch of eco-silliness in the plot and the aforementioned pace problems rear their ugly heads a time or two, but the Hellboy flicks are about two things: a whole lot of action and Guillermo del Toro's fabulist vision of the world. Rest assured you're going to get the former, and as for the latter, the only time del Toro has failed to deliver was in Blade II, where his hands were tied by an already-existing iconography. The world of The Golden Army is that same blend of the real and the fantastic that's made all of his foreign movies so amazing. For sheer visual spectacle, it's hard to beat del Toro. And while the film is a bit slack and soap-opera-y, it's still big, stupid fun. ***at del Toro. And while the film is a bit slack and soap-opera-y, it's still big, stupid fun. ***

I picked it up from a friend's bookshelf before a long trip, and it made the plane rides more than bearable (I was actually looking forward to flying!) and time spent on the beach better than I could have imagined. I had to slow myself down when reading because part of me wanted to know what happened next, and part of me wanted to savor the words, analogies, and story in general. I want to read it again!

I do not have this problem when I watch Netflix instant movies.
B0019IB26I|5.0|First of all, I have to say I am the biggest John Mayer fan that I know. I have all his albums and this one by far is the best. Slow Dancing in a Burning Room is sultry, sexy and sad....but in a good way. And Gravity is amazing as well. When he goes into the bridge, it makes me want to cry. OK, OK a little dramatic I know, but I could listen to this man play guitar all day LONG! All his other standards are great too, Why Georgia, Belief but it's the others, Good Love is On the Way, I Don't Need No Doctor, where you can really rock out.

B003YOMNCM|5.0|Hilary Hahn, once again, gracefully proves her fearless and mature artistry through the daunting Higdon concerto and the very well-known Tchaikovsky concerto. It is clear that Hahn never settles for mere virtuosic ostentation. Turning away from the gaudy approach that many violinists take toward the Tchaikovsky concerto, Hahn delves into the music and interprets it in a restrained but most heartfelt manner. She doesn't wrestle with the piece; she dances with it and lets it speak for itself. The Higdon concerto is just wonderful. It captures Hahn's energy and artistic consistency very well. Throughout the two concerti, Hahn can be seen as either Athena in a tough battle shining with her wisdom and perfect control or a young lady in an idyllic landscape embodying purity and evoking nostalgia. Hahn's versatility is admirable.    It is, however, unfortunate that some listeners can't pick up this beautiful music in the noise of their prejudices. Some can't get over Hahn's physical youth and something as absurd as their own resistance to the Tchaikovsky concerto's popularity, to judge the music for what it is. I encourage you to listen to the music with an open mind and appreciate what Hahn has accomplished with this recording.

0061537969|3.0|I am a old race car driver, and a lifelong collector and driver of, sports cars. I am also a lifelong dog owner. Armed with these facts, many had been urging me to read Garth Stein's book.    Others also knew I am a HUGE fan of Richard Bach, and of Jonathon Livingston Seagull. Knowing that others held this in their minds as they recommended the book to, I read it, and just finished it. I thought they'd have a good idea of what I'd like in the way of books...    Meh. Glad  only paid 3 bucks for it!    Stein either has a great command of the lingo of high-performance driving, and/or is a helluva researcher, because his descriptions of how to race a car, and the attendant details of the racing world, are absolutely accurate, as are his 'dog insights.'    but, I found the book a bit draggy, a bit...snooty, for lack of a better word. Enzo's thoughts and voice, though at turns cute and pithy, lacked any of the real insight that JLS brought to bear upon his 'shortcomings' as an animal. Bach did a MUCH more masterful job at creating inner dialogue, to convey what JLS was thinking, than does Stein of his Enzo.    It certainly wasn't a bad book but, it's no JLS!
0385732554|4.0|I am generally not a fan of books set in a Utopian futuristic society. Brave New World and 1984 are others that I have read, but not thoroughly enjoyed. In this novel, Jonas, a 12-year-old boy, is given his assignment as \\"The Receiver,\\" which means that he receives memories of the world from the previous Receiver, now referred to as \\"The Giver.\\" In Jonas's world, there are many rules that that the members of this society have to adhere to, words must be very carefully used, and there is no such thing as color. As Jonas receives memories from the Giver, he decides that this world he is living in is incredibly unfair and devises a plan to run away to \\"Elsewhere\\" with a child. Although I typically do not like these types of books, I found this one incredibly easy to read. The one thing that I really did not like, however, was the ending. It is very difficult to tell whether or not Jonas and Gabriel actually made it to Elsewhere, or if they died from hunger. This aspect would be great for discussion though, because I could easily see students disagreeing greatly on the ending.

B003W4YQUG|2.0|Maybe you have to be homosexual to ignore the limits of this film.  I do not know.  The characters and dialog are lacking real human dimension.  At the end, I could only say, \\"what was the point?\\".  It cannot have been the lack of acceptance of homosexuals or their desire for acceptance which is the standard gay story.  The characters did not need to be gay and the homosexual content of the film added nothing in my opinion.  The story was that a man lost a lover and his heart condition (which usually presents itself on the left side of the male body instead of the right side) lead to his death before unappealing suicide attempt scenarios could be achieved.  If you like nude gay guys in water scenes, this is the empty film for you.  I only viewed it to the end because I thought there might be some salvation to this film.  I was disappointed.  Lastly, I am sure some will call me homophobic, but I am tired of the interjection of homosexuality into films only for the sake of justifying or accepting homosexuality.  I accept it.  Enough is enough.
0545310601|5.0|Just a warning: this review contains spoilers.        I started reading Mockingjay with very high expectations but I didn't know exactly what those expectations were. I guess part of me wanted Katniss to become more militant against the Capitol and to take on the war herself, but my expectations weren't realistic. Collins wrote this book as realistically as possible, and I respect her for it. She didn't pander to her fans, she wrote exactly what needed to happen.    Though the Hunger Games trilogy is interlaced with a love triangle, it is not a love story. It is a war story with victims, psychological damage, pain, loss, and the lives that people must lead in times of war. In short, it's realistic. In this novel Katniss seems to be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and her behavior reflects it. She could no longer be the girl on fire. As with life, every flame must eventually be extinguished. Now that I look back on it, this is exactly where Collins was leading her readers the entire time.    This book brilliantly shows the trials and hardships of war. Katniss' inner monologue develops and she's not the same Katniss that we know and remember from the first two books. She's broken.    Peeta's hijacking, while very upsetting, seems to me to be the exact kind of thing that one would expect the Capitol to do. There is no mercy in war, and Peeta had to be an unfortunate sacrifice to bring that theme to the forefront in this book.    As for the resolve of the love triangle, I was glad that it was resolved at the very end of the novel because lives are put on hold in times of war. Katniss couldn't devote her time to figuring out which man she wanted more because she had to kill Snow.    Prim's death is tragic but realistic.    Over all, I wasn't a fan of this book when I first read it. In fact, I hated it. Now that I had re-read it I see the reason for what Collins did and it makes me respect her more as an author.    This is a war story. Sacrifices are made.

B003PIUBZS|5.0|I must confess, I found the first 2 episodes slow going, with the necessary introduction of characters and links to their back stories. Then I was drawn in by the smarmy charm of John Hannah as Batiatus and his love for his wicked Lucrezia. Then we have Glaber and his whore of a wife, the couple we love to hate! Best of all were Varro and Spartacus--- their friendship gave heart to the series. Kudos to the writers for the earthy wit of the dialogue. SPARTACUS is a visual feast but also brings to us a fleshed-out legend. I look forward to the next season.
B002KREVE2|5.0|I was at this gig. I was 16yrs old.    I was absolutely entranced by Leonard Cohen. I already knew his material from the albums 'Songs From A Room' & 'Songs Of Leonard Cohen' and I thought his stuff was fantastic (still do!)     Live he had an effortless charisma. His stage announcements were wry, humorous, enigmatic and poetic.    His band, The Army, were sensitive and unobtrusive on the gentler songs. On the more energetic songs they were a pleasingly ramshackle country hoe-down band with prominent banjo & fiddle. They won me over completely (even though I'm really not a country & western fan!)    My only complaint is, if they had this brilliant recording in the can, why did it take them 40yrs to release it?!?!?!

Having read \\"Getting Real\\", though, this book served to reinforce the ideas and further energize me. Sort of like David Allen's \\"Getting Things Done\\", this book proves that common sense isn't so common these days.

1401216676|4.0|\\"So when you find yourself locked onto an unpleasant train of thought, heading for the places in your past where the screaming is unbearable, remember there's always madness. Madness is the Emergency Exit. You can just step outside, and close the door on all those dreadful things that happened. You can lock them away. Forever.\\"    The Killing Joke is the familiar story of Batman and the Joker. We see the Joker begin his plan, some hints at the Joker's origin, and then Comissionar Gordon and his daughter, Barbra, are at home, and the doorbell is ringing...    The Joker enters and, with no preamble whatsoever, blows both Barbara's spine and any pretences of the rules away.     The Killing Joke is a psychological battle a personal duel between Batman and the Joker, where the stakes are reality. Convinced that all the separates sane from insane, perception from reality, is \\"one bad day,\\" the Joker puts Gordon through hell unimaginable. Shown photographs of his wounded, nude daughter. Stripped naked and surrounded by the deformed and the deranged. Subjected to the Joker's arguments and ministrations. By the end of it, the Joker knows, he will be insane.    The Joker is a mockery of everything that is human. Having seen beyond us, he is the master of everything that we are and hold dear. He is practically asexual himself, yet he strips Barbra and shows Gordon the pictures, all to destroy the man. At the height of his power in the novel, he speaks to his minions, those who have been enlightened, about humanity, and he does it by describing a creature in a cage, something obsolete, interesting in the same way as any specimen is, any part of the past, but something hopelessly inferior nonetheless. His expressions and poses are as manic as his dialogue. At times, he's scared and almost comically intimidated, at others he's maniacal, others terrified, and, at some times, he's simply hidden by shadow:      Of course, Batman shows up, invited by the Joker. The two are opposites,diametrically opposed and fated to clash again and again:     \\"I've been thinking lately. About you and me...We're going to kill each other, aren't we? Perhaps you'll kill me. Perhaps I'll kill you. Perhaps sooner. Perhaps later...Are you listening to me? It's life and death that we're discussing here. Maybe my death. Maybe yours.\\"    Batman and the Joker are opposites, yes, but they are more than that. They are two heads of the same man, victims to that same One Bad Day, each taking a different lesson from their catalyst. The Joker dedicated himself to destroying that existence that he'd once had, proving to the rest of the world that darkness is all that matters. Batman dedicated his life to preserving the reality that he no longer shares.     The Killing Joke is marred by two flaws. The first, and the lesser, of the two, is Gordon's sanity at the end. Now, I'm not disputing the end result. What I do have a problem with is that we never really see him change, at all. I don't know if a man would truly break, no matter the man, in circumstances like those here, as the Joker claims, but it's clear that it would change him. While I'm sure that Gordon does change, in the course of the narrative, we don't see it. We see his horrified, naked figure as he's tormented, we see him a cage, and then, at the end, we see him say: \\"I want him brought in by the book.\\" There's no indication that Gordon felt anything at all; we are kept entirely out of his head, leaving us with a perfect picture of both extremes, but nothing much in the middle, no real grasp of how the common man fits into the picture.    My other complaint stems from Gordon's aforementioned line. Let's look at that for a second: \\"I want him brought in by the book.\\" Uh, by the book? Excuse me? I'm pretty sure that the book does not include a masked vigilante chasing down the criminals, beating them to a bloody pulp, and then handing over the leftovers. In fact, I'm pretty sure that that's as far from any police procedural as you can get.     The second flaw is far more important. The Killing Joke is a novel that explores the human psyche, but it's one that does so from firmly within the formula of its genre, and it even goes so far as to call attention to the tropes that it's obeying...because. At times, it's hard to feel like anything in The Killing Joke matters. Batman's sending Joker back to Arkham, but neither character even bothers to pretend it's the last time, and both of them openly acknowledge that there will be a final showdown someday, but certainly not here. The possibility that maybe Batman won't find the Joker, or that the Joker will win, or that he'll get away, none of that is even considered here.     The atmosphere and psychological aspects of The Killing Joke come off brilliantly, but the page turning suspense that one assumes to be the core of a super hero comic is totally missing. Still, if you're a Batman fan, or are just curious about the genre, this is an essential read.

0385416067|4.0|I am, in general, a reader of fact, not fiction, but the environment in one of the stories made me buy the book!<br />The story is called Strikebreaker, and it is about a world which is like an asteroid where they have basically hollowed it out and are living on the inside of it at many levels at 50 metres per level, which gives an awful lot of living space.  Earlier I read a book called \\"Asimov on Astronomy\\", where Strikebreaker is mentioned due to a consideration about living inside a planet-/oid.<br /><br />So, I ordered this book with the story and was hoping to get a thorough description of this world by Asimov. Well he has done the maths, but does not go into much detail about how it could be done.  I was disappointed on that score.<br /><br />However in this book there are so many very short stories that if a title grabs your interest most of them are not a long affair to go through, and there are quite a lot of stories with a good idea on how things could be done.  This is a good feature of all those stories by Asimov.  I do not read fiction, or science fiction, but Asimov being such a fantastic science writer, seems to have convinced me to check out some of his stories for ideas.  This book confirms the conviction, even if I know I won't read it all.
0316067938|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this book because I've been back and forth on the others.  Book 1 \\"Twilight\\" was a great book.  It was interesting and captivating as we got to know the characters and the connection between Edward and Bella.  Book 2 (New Moon) was annoying because Bella was such a drama queen, and Book 3 (Eclipse) was frustrating because Bella was so wishy-washy about making a stand to love Edward and telling Jacob to back off (she totally leads him on).  I was REALLY surprised and impressed that Bella is so much more confident and sooo much less annoying in this book!  I loved the story (totally unexpected)and I have to say that every single book is a million times better than the LAME MOVIES!  I was very pleasantly surprised and pleased with it.  Buy the book, it's worth the money.

It is entertaining, funny in part, and remindful of the importance of listening to and understanding ourselves and the importance of exploring one's spirituality, however one defines spirituality.      Lucky for us, Ms. Gilbert shares her insight openly and honestly.  Geez Louise folks, she is not whiny and, honestly, not every woman wants kids, so what's up with the judgments?  If you're not self-absorbed while on a spiritual journey, then what's the point of being on that journey?  Way too much author negativity in some of these reviews...    This is a good book, and I have re-read many of the tales.  Did it change my life?  Maybe not, but it has given me some new ideas to ponder, and that's about all I need from a book.
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|Another great season of Grey's - the intricate relationships among characters, the most intense finale of a TV show I have ever seen!!, the amazing acting, and writing.  There were a lot of things thrown at us in terms of new characters and such this season.  Love it!
B0019NB9A2|4.0|Skimming already posted reviews, I saw none that actually address the Blu-ray version released Sep. 2010!! So let's get to it: Do I love this movie? This is my fifth version of it, following the VHS, LaserDisc, initial DVD and remastered DVD versions. This is what you need to know: There is very little discernible improvement in the image over the standard DVD versions. I guess this must be attributed to a largely subdued initial color palette/lighting and fading of the original Technicolor images. My screen only \\"lit up\\" and looked like a Blu-ray image during the major confrontation with the Monster from the Id. Bonus Material: The behind the scenes material was new to me, but it's not terribly extensive or comprehensive. If you are a Robby fan, you should own \\"The Invisible Boy,\\" included here. Warner continues its tradition of reasonably priced home video product, and I applaud them for that. In summary: If you love this flick and somehow have failed to own it previously, buy this release now!! Just don't expect to be blown away by the quality of the image. This is a 5-star movie in a 4-star (technical considerations) release.
B003YOMNCM|3.0|The Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto has done yeoman service in countless concerts, serving as the spoonful of sugar that makes a modern piece go down. So it is here. The drawing card is Hilary Hahn's first recording of the Tchaikovsky so that she can also premiere the Higdon concerto, which she commissioned. Higdon teaches composition at Curtis, where Hahn studied and met her as a teenager. No one need fear that this pairing will be a fearsome as Hahn's recent album that featured the Schoenberg and Sibelius concertos-Higdon's neo-romantic style provides its own sugar, in the form of delicate filigree from celesta and glockenspiel offsetting airy harmonics in the violin. and there is plenty of tonality and more than a handful of melodies and semi-melodies. In other words this is music pleading to be liked. Audiences respond to Hidgon's come-hither, and I'm sure the same will be true of this work, especially as carried off by Hahn, who looks fresh and youthful even though she has passed thirty. but behind its agreeable facade, I doubt that the Higdon has much staying power.<br /><br />Hahn mentions in the video promo that she hasn't played the Tchaikovsky concerto since she was a young teenager, and if you read between the lines, you know why. This work bores violinists even though audiences never tire of it. There are many technical challenges but zero intellectual ones. Only the Russians seem to find the music fresh, which brings us to the only real news in this release. Vasily Petrenko, at 34, has skyrocketed in his career, and now he has crossed over to the most prestigious of record labels after a couple of years on Naxos, bringing the Royal Liverpool orchestra with him. Can he and Hahn mount a youth charge on Tchaikovsky?<br /><br />the answer depends on your expectations. the overall contour of their reading is soft and fairly small scale. In that regard, Hahn is almost as recessive -- by the standards of Heifetz or Oistrakh -- as Joshua Bell was on is recent recording with Tilson Thomas. And despite being Russian, Petrenko is also refined and low key. I appreciate the revisionist thinking, but the Tchaikovsky concerto isn't an aristocrat waiting to be noticed. It's a blockbuster popular favorite that wears its heart on its sleeve, and the bigger the heart, the greater the impact. I don't want a low-impact performance, but many fans of Hahn may well.on Thomas. And despite being Russian, Petrenko is also refined and low key.

Only left me one doubt whether they are brand new as described or not, since I didn't find any plastic membrane in the package.

B003V5PPZG|5.0|I write this not because I'm an avid LP fan but to do justice to all the bad reviews this album has been getting. From the launch of Hybrid Theory till this day I cannot deny that it is one of my favorite albums that I still listen to on a (very) regular basis. It is apparent that LP had a great head-start to their career and a clear indication that they were getting their personal lives on track (Crawling - Chester's story of sexual abuse, In the end - his failed marriage) hence the angst and hatred.  Fast forward a decade. The band has developed and matured, as most of us would have. Their music has evolved lyrically and artistically from the initial anger and self pity to what really matters in this world; poverty, war, politics. The true humanitarians they are! The album has 15 tracks, 9 of which are full songs with 6 short melodies incorporated with actual footage of historians including Martin Luther King and Robert Oppenheimer in what I would describe as their way of emphasizing the significance of the album to them. Most people dislike these short tracks, but, I love the way they play into the album and harmonize each song. My favorite track is # 5 \\"When they come for me\\". The beat, the diversity, the switch from Shinoda's rapped out sanguine don't-give-a-damn lyrics to Bennington's calmer tone just makes you press repeat. My least favorite being #6 \\"Robot boy\\". It seems to me they kind of going for a boy band piece which frankly I'm not too fond of. Despite that, I loved loved this album and would recommend it to anyone mature enough to understand its meaning. As per Shinoda's \\"When they come for me\\" - Everybody wants the next thing to be just like the first , Y'all oughta stop talking, start tryin' to catch up!!!
B003VWC4AI|4.0|This book is thought provoking and freeing.  By seeing where your passion is, you are free not to pursue what others might see as what you need to pursue. Much of the \\"stonework\\" of this book seems to be an indictment of the educational system in general, but there are nuggets of gold to be found.
B001FB563E|3.0|2.5 stars<br /><br />...if your family likes eating other families, perhaps. But for those of us who tend towards the non-cannibalistic, The Road might just be the most depressing movie ever made.<br /><br />McCarthy's book is harsher than this, mainly because it takes a lot longer than 110 minutes to read. For me the best thing about the film of it was that I knew it must at some point end. I agree with those who find Viggo's acting excellent and that the movie is very true to the book, but all considered I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone but those who love deep, deep pessimism and gloom.<br /><br />[Spoilers aplenty to follow...but then this whole movie is almost the ultimate cinematic spoiler.]<br />The main thing most fans praise in the book and film is the (unnamed) Man's deep love of his son. Granted, it's there, and is shown with much conviction and intensity. But if the overriding message is that the love we have for our families trumps all, then the lack of love the Man has for anyone but his son is equally dispiriting. His son has to almost force him to show any care whatsoever for the thief and the old man. Sure, to help strangers is to risk the survival of his son and himself...but to what end? They seek \\"good people\\"...but the Man seems to be good people to his son and no one else. This story feels like it wants to be a sort of Christian allegory, yet consciously begs the issue of what exactly separates good people from bad. Surely that line is crossed far before cannibalism is resorted to.<br /><br />Is the message here that the only love that really counts is love for our immediate kin? In a post-apocalyptic world where the continuation of our DNA is a tenuous proposition at very best, isn't love for life in all its forms, and mankind in all its misery, the main redemptive force? Letting others die so that you may live is not much better than eating other people, is it? Maybe I'm missing something here, but The Road seems to have nothing positive whatsoever to say about life, except perhaps that when push comes to shove we'll do almost anything for our families' survival. But we already know that. Other works of art have gone far beyond that point to show how a literally Christ-like love of all people transcends the self-centered love of those we are kin to. Shrouding the opposite thought in non-stop pathos hardly redeems the notion.<br /><br />Director Hillcoat does everything he can to make this the grimmest-looking film of all time (thus making the blu-ray pointless, unless high-def misery is your goal). Not once is there a tiny ray of sunlight; that might suggest some sort of optimism, and then where would we be? We might end up having a good thought, and that's not allowed here. The only good thought possible is that the Man loves his son. And that's it. By the end, I felt cheated in many ways by that refusal to let these characters have any lightness whatsoever. (Except maybe when they find the coke and the del monte etc cans...that product placement was so weirdly glaring, featuring the only color in the film. I would love to have seen the PP salesman pitch this to the companies: \\"Hey, we'll give you full color saturation in this grayest of movies, and your Brand will seem like the Second Coming!\\" Irony on a whole other level.)<br /><br />History shows over and over that people have a sense of humor, often at the most unfunny of moments. It's what makes us people, as much as our love for our families, I'd venture. Read the story of mankind and you'll find rays of moral and ethical light in the darkest of places and hours. But such humanity is basically forbidden here in any way. And to what end? When the film was over I could only shake my head at how little redemption of any sort there was. The whole point of showing darkness in art, to my mind, is to show how we as people can rise above it. The Road seems to say, it's okay to sink as low as you must to save your family. But what about the familyof man?<br /><br />For all its perfect depiction of total despair, along with Mortensen's fine acting, I can't think of any reason to possibly recommend watching this movie, unless you loved the book. And even then the movie offers little that isn't already in the novel. Yes, watching others suffer makes our own problems seem smaller by comparison, but I can think of hundreds of other films that offer the same message along with some real beauty and even occasional redemptive joy tossed into their pits of gloom.<br /><br />Too real to be a \\"fun\\" zombie-cannibal flick and too unrelentingly depressing to be any sort of pleasure to experience, The Road is like watching a car accident in verrry slow motion. I would say that if you really need to know how bad life can be, go down to your local homeless shelter and see how close today's real life is to post-apocalyptic for actual people in your town, right now. And then maybe show them some of the love shown by the Man to his son here.<br /><br />Watching the same idea played out vicariously on the screen in the comfort of our homes somehow almost seems like cheating.of man?<br /><br />For all its perfect depiction of total despair, along with Mortensen's fine acting, I can't think of any reason to possibly recommend watching this movie, unless you loved the book.

B003XWEQ1G|3.0|While I was disappointed in the film - the reviews are not reviewing an \\"unrated directors cut\\" but for the most, if not all, are only reviewing the theatrical release.<br />While I agree the movie has little merit the reviews have none if they are not reviewing the product.<br />No one saw an unrated directors cut in the theater. It is only those reviews that are a value for this product.
0345505387|1.0|Don't waste your money on this one. To be fair, I ordered this as soon as it was listed before any sample pages were available. It's nothing more than a many-paged comic strip story. I thought I ordered \\"Jamie's Side of the Story.\\" I will never again waste my money on another graphic novel. Huge disappointment.
0525421580|5.0|I honestly loved this book. It was really funny but wasn't lacking in plot. I loved the distinct narration styles mostly because I felt they were very realistic... usually young adults don't seem this real in books. This book had me cracking up from the beginning to the end. read it!

B003HN7BYA|1.0|This is a terrible waste of time and an insult to the memory of Diamond Darrell.    You get a \\"Remastered\\" Version of the original album - which is a joke unless you are a completely geeky audiophile with an amazing stereo.  This album came out in 1990 and on a major label (with good production values), so there really is no noticeable difference in sound to the naked ear.    There are two useless disks of live material and inferior demo-sounding material - of the same songs on the original LP.    For $23.99, you would think Pantera (or their record label) would offer up some original content to justify repurchasing the album.    Pathetic. Pathetic. PATHETIC!!!!

0375836675|5.0|I am a sporadic reader. Usually I'm on the run from school to work and then, if I have time, I let loose and go out with my friends. I only get a craving to just sit down an read once every four or five months and when my sister recommended this book to me, I was hooked. I took it to work with me and read on my breaks and it was the same at school.  Zusak made an interesting story which was carried by an even more interesting character. Not that I can totally relate to everything but the person he embodied in this book almost felt like a real person. Right to the very last page. I never had a moment where the book dragged or lost my interest and I probably finished in one week. This is good for me given I have an average of two hours of free time daily.  Read it, love it, and appreciate a well crafted story. Thanks, Matt Zusak.
B0027BOL4G|1.0|This is the typical the 'sky is falling' and 'we are all going to die' documentary. Its intent is to shock you into eating organic and purchasing from local markets only. Of course buying local is better for you.  Of course not ingesting pesticides is healthier. There are no REAL steps for solving the problem, nothing that you could grab onto and move forward. Just the impending doom to the planet because you happen to need to eat.  Perhaps this gives someone the reason to take better care of themselves, it just gave me the urge to argue against the one-sided debate that they presented.
B002IYEQR4|5.0|I'm a reviewer from France. I mention this at first because for all Blu-ray fans and Watchmen lovers, this one is region-free and thus can be enjoyed on your local, non-American player. Second important bit of information: this particular version of the movie is no longer available and must be purchased - often for a premium- from second-hand dealers.  It was released after the movie as a \\"treat\\" for hardcore [[ASIN:1401219268 Watchmen]] fans longing for the complete, frame-by-frame adaptation of the beloved Moore/Gibbons/Higgins (those surreal colors!) classic. I don't think I need to get into the whole development hell saga with the Gilliams and whatnots attached to this supposedly impossible-to-adapt-story.   What you get here, if you can get it (this is written 09/21/2010), is the \\"ultimate cut\\" of the already 2.5 hrs adaptation of the comics which adds up to a big fat 3.35 hours of viewing. The added elements include most notably the animated version of the \\"Tale of the Black freighter\\" mirroring (spoiler!) Ozymandias' descent into moral murkiness.  This is a five-star review because the film is simply too beautiful to watch. The editing (the animated sequences especially are beautifully integrated), the casting, the photography and the attention given to respecting the original are top-notch. But I do have some criticisms which to me bar this from being a true classic:  - first, slavishly transfering the composition of each scene on the screen does not automatically translate the feeling associated with that scene. Although I have been quite entranced at each viewing, I'm always left with a certain emotional void. That is due to a lack of real feeling of foreboding. Plus no-one seems to be actually touched by the events unfolding. Concerned maybe, but not touched. And this is not due to the superb cast. All the right ingredients are there, but my feeling is that the cook failed to let all the flavors intermingle and express the true ambition of this particulardish (sorry, French love of food taking over!)  - The second aspect that I realized bothered me on subsequent viewing: the music. Once again, a collage of great songs and pieces does not a great soundtrack make. Case in point: I love Philip Glass and the piece played during the Mars scene - but I'd have loved an  original, equally grandiose piece, that the director could have pushed for in his vision with his own composer (there is one for the movie: Tyler Bates).  All in all, I think this is a great movie, but kind of an empty shell with all the right beats save for the ache of losing friends, the torment of past, present and ... future regrets or the feeling of impending doom that prevaded the original comics.  Finally, although this version is great, my belief is that most casual fans can survive with the theater or director's cuts.
B0001I561E|5.0|I loved this movie.  Robbin Williams brought the Genie to life and kept my family laughing.  The story is great.  My only issue is that Jasmine was small.  Why must Disney insist on all of the girls being so small?
B0030Y11XS|5.0|Capitalism: A Love Story kept me captivated from beginning to end.  I love Michael Moore.  I like documentaries that say the truth.  Even though MM sometimes embellished too much in other documentaries, i.e. Bowling for Columbine. Here he hits the nail on the head. He makes us look at ourselves and the way Greed had destroyed this country.  Loved the part about Wall Street.
B00005NB8K|5.0|This movie is really great. Val Kilmer deserves am award for his portrail of Jim Morrison. All the actors that played the Doors were awesome because Val really sang and the other guys really played their instruments. If you love the Doors and Jim Morrison then you will really love this movie. Also with the help of the remaining Doors Oliver Stone made this movie true to life and according to the facts.

Definately for the beginning scholar.

1932100660|5.0|There are lots of people who are trying to make lifestyle changes to promote good health. One of the things that makes such change difficult is the impossibility of figuring out whose advice to believe, when every scientific study that comes out seems to contradict the one before it. This book helped me to understand (finally) why those inconsistencies happen, and why we've been looking at the diet part of this equation in entirely the wrong way. It turns out that almost every American's diet has more in common with every other American's diet than it has with the diet of any person outside of North America and the Eurozone. It is possible to see clear and consistent correlations between diet and disease only when we use data that includes a wider variety of eating patterns than is available within the United States itself. When this broader data-base is used, however, some startling conclusions are not only possible, but irrefutable. There is a direct and incontrovertible linkage between the amount of animal-based food we consume and the diseases that typically kill us. Why have we not been given this painfully simple information before now? If you're interested, the book has a theory that I personally find compelling. Whether or not you do, however, you'll never look at a burger the same way again. I promise.

I hope nobody else reads this, luckily for me i was in a polisci class so I was able to compare the authors view points to history of this country. if more people read up on our 227year old constitution they would know we have the only constitution that has the lease amount of changes, and quit frankly its the only rule book, that doesn't give rules to our citizens CAN NOT DO, but what WE CAN DO!

0891419195|5.0|This book is one of the most well written first person accounts of the Pacific War I have ever read. I have read many WW2 books and this one is by far, my favorite.<br /> Eugene Sledge is a very articulate man, who describes in detail the horror of war these young Marines faced during the island campaign against the fanatical Japanese.  Sometimes lacking even the most basic necessities, such as water, these men fought on in the tropical 115 deg. heat in the early days on Peleliu.<br /> On Okinawa they fought not only the Japanese but also the rainy weather and the mud.<br /> The misery is unimaginable. They are truly our greatest generation.
B0036EH3X4|4.0|I was hooked from the beginning and I loved the trip Lost took me on but the final episode threw me for a loop! Im a patient guy but after 6 years Mr. Abrams took the wind out of my sails. The final episode was actually really good but one of the \\"biggest\\" characters was completely ignored. THE ISLAND! We got no answers to what the island is and how it has all those freakish qualities. I aslo dont agree with people who say Lost is the greatest show ever on television. I think Battlestar Galactica holds that crown but Lost is pretty good. It is in the ballpark even though the ending was a bit incomplete.<br /><br />If the ending was more explanatory and complete I would have given this review that 5th star and I would've bought the entire series on Blu-Ray. I do like the show but to much was not explained for my taste.

The vocals are fantastic, bass is great, drums can't be better and Joe Bonamassa is the greatest guitarist in the history of mankind and his solos rock. This is an instant classic that belongs in the same category as Zeppelin's Houses of the Holy, Pink Floyd's The Wall and Guns n Roses Appetite for destruction. If you love straight up kick butt rock n roll this CD is the best there is. This CD does not deserve 5 stars it deserves 999999999999999 stars.It is head and shoulders above everyone else.
1439181780|4.0|I have read The Secret a few years ago and picked this book up as I had enjoyed The Secret.  As with The Secret, The Power can be a little repetitious, but, at the same time, I believe that repetition to be reinforcing the instructions presented.  Those instructions are to feel love, present love, be thankful and grateful.  All positive elements even when dealing with negative ones.    There are those who will feel negatively about this book.  That it's too simple.  That it's all \\"happy thoughts, positive vibes... Love, Love, Love\\".  Yes, it is.  But is that necessarily a bad thing?  Is it bad to look at all the positive things in your life and be happy and grateful for those things and to also look at all the negative things in your life and envision those negative things taking a positive turn and believing that they will even if the source of that belief (and the energy behind it) is something as \\"fluffy\\" as LOVE?    I will tell you what I have learned from reading this book: just 2 days prior to reading it I was an irritable, grumpy, negative person.  I was sitting in a little depression pit, not necessarily feeling sorry for myself, but mostly feeling sorry about the situations I was in (whether at work or home).  The positivity of the book and the reinforced instructions helped to get me out of this pit I was in and has me feeling better about my life and better about my future in this life.  I'm grateful for the positive elements in my life and am working to bring more positive elements in.  Whether that's through love or just a general good outlook on life, I don't care.  Yes, there are still some negative elements that continue to rear their ugly heads (this wouldn't be life if you didn't have them; lessons must be learned), I just know that I'm happier after completing this book than I was going into it and plan to maintain the positivity.

0553805371|2.0|The Grand Design disappointed in three ways.  First, much of it was a rehash and repackage of material discussed in The Brief History of Time and the streamlined Briefer History of time.  Second, Hawking and Mlodinow ultimately failed to explain the creation of the universe out of nothing by placing responsibility on natural laws, which they fail to give a creation account for.  Thirdly, I feel the analogy drawn between M Theory and multiple maps is ridiculous.  Yes, a single map doesn't give an accurate portrayal of the world in which we live but that's why someone invented the globe.      On a final note the authors give a very quick overview of roughly 2,500 years of Western philosophy and reveal their lack of understanding of the subject.  They seem to want to put Aquinas in the category of animists, which he wasn't, they want to depict the God of Newton and Descartes as the laws of nature, nothing more, nothing less, which it wasn't, and they fail to understand that Heraclitus' work was written to be intentionally difficult to understand so its few remaining fragments should not be taken for their face value, which the authors did.

I'm not a huge Martha fan but she has never steered me wrong in the past. I bought the book! I am very impressed with this book. It's broken down into sections; swirled and sprinkled, dipped and glazed, simple and sweet, filled and layered, piped and topped, birthdays, holidays and celerations. It has 175 recipes and decorating ideas. The photos are amazing. The recipes are easy to follow. I do not regret buying this book!
0385342047|5.0|First, let me be up front: I'm a Sophie Kinsella fan. I discovered Confessions of a Shopaholic when it first came out and was instantly hooked. Becky has a charm all her own, and in this latest installment, she's a mom, there's a recession and she's trying to save money, plan a party for her husband, Luke, and do a little detective work. Of course, hilarity ensues.<br /><br />The addition of her daughter, Minnie, who has acquired her mothers acquisitive ways, is entertaining, if over the top, though watching Becky rationalize Minnie's pin money is familiar and fun. The real magic here is the way Luke can read Becky like a book, even as she tries to shop less. Her attempts at bartering are quite entertaining. I don't want to spoil the book too much but will say that Becky's relationship with her family and most everyone she knows wind up extremely strained by her sneaking around ways. Kinsella works in the financial woes of the world and tries to put Becky on a budget. Zany fun that'll have Becky surely winning over new readers and wooing old ones. The only thing I didn't think was on par with previous books were Becky's formal letters; they were very Becky, with suggestions to government leaders about the economy, but didn't quite have the zing of the early ones to her bank managers. That's a very minor quibble in what could be called recession chick lit, or just plain page-turning escapism.

This production is a wonderful investment.  Thanks for your help with the purchase.  I could find it nowhere locally.  What a shame!  This movie should be available everywhere.

0374158460|1.0|Don't fall for Oprah pushing this anti-freedom, anti-Constitution book!  Oprah has an agenda, and it's not good. She is New Age, she pushed for Obama, who is a big Globalist. This book needs to be exposed for what it is, it is against personal freedom and individuality, and it's right on track with what Oprah has been pushing for years. She is for the New World Order and is an anti-Christian. We must protect our Constitution and Bill of Rights, and this book is against everything that makes this country special!
0385342047|2.0|I received an advanced copy of this book and was really torn as I had decided after my last negative reviews NOT to read anymore books in this series.  However, I caved in and as soon as I started reading, I knew that I was in trouble.<br /><br />Firstly, while the concept is actually funny (or could have been), Kinsella manages to create a mini-terror instead of a mini-shopaholic.  This kid is spoiled rotten, has zero intelligence and is annoying beyond words - basically like her mother.  The only part that I thought was cute was the interaction between mini shopaholic and her grandmother - those passages were both funny and oddly touching.<br /><br />Secondly, can someone please, please smack Becky once and for all. My pet peeve in the last few books was the fact that while she is supposed to be maturing (wife, mother, etc) she does not seem to get any smarter or any wiser at all AND everyone around her simply seems to think she is soooo cute and soooo adorable - instead of basically giving her a much needed intervention.<br /><br />Thirdly, with the kind of hardship most of us have had to go through in the last few years, I am not certain this book is appropriate or actually timely.<br /><br />So, in short, this is a 2 star book.  Hopefully, this is the end of the line for this particular series.  If you are looking for some good Sophie Kinsella, read some of her other books - which are actually enjoyable.
B000001E21|3.0|Def Leppard was now in the midst of its second decade as a recording band and with a solidified lineup (Vivian Campbell replacing the late Steve Clark) the band was able to follow their monster seller `Hysteria' and somewhat less monster in `Adrenalize' with another big subsequent tour to introduce Viv to their fans. In a rare move not seen since the early `80's, Def Leppard actually released back to back albums in consecutive years in the fall of 1993. In the interest of full disclosure however, `Retro Active' was not really a new album but a collection of B-sides and leftovers from the 1987-1992 era. Some of the songs had been collectors' items such as \\"Ring of Fire\\", \\"I Wanna Be Your Hero\\" and a `Hysteria' era remake of their very first single \\"Ride Into the Sun\\"(awesome version of this tune!). These aforementioned tunes are among the best on this collection. Other standouts include the hit \\"Two Steps Behind\\", \\"Desert Song\\" (surprisingly heavy for this period of Def Lep!) and \\"Fractured Love\\".  Not crazy about the covers of Sweet or Mick Ronson or some of the other oddities. `Retro Active' is a decent record, not essential but maybe for fans.
B003MZ0I84|4.0|It's been about three years since Maroon 5 released their last album `It Won't Be Soon Before Long' and the time off seems to have done them well. The first thing I noticed about their new album `Hands All Over' is that it feels a lot more inspired and peppy than their last album. The last album, in my opinion, felt too big, too unfocused and overall not too interesting. This album however reminds me a lot of why they became so popular to begin with and the rock, pop, funk fusion makes for an exciting album. Is it perfect? No, hardly any album is but these tracks fit together well to make for an enjoyable listening experience. I also liked that for this album the group seemed to hold back on the slow ballads that overpopulated the last album. There were only two really slow tracks and the rest were fast faced, quick and really fun and carefree.<br /><br />The deluxe edition comes with a generous offering of bonus tracks. These include two additional tracks and two acoustic versions of two tracks from the standard album and a live track. For the most part, I feel the group made a decent album unlike some artist who save their best material for the deluxe edition and make bonus tracks out of tracks that really should have been on the regular album. I liked the \\"Misery\\" acoustic track because it turns an upbeat, pop song into something of a laidback, easy listening track, giving the song an entirely new vibe and interpretation. The Alicia Keys cover is really amazing and Adam Levine did an amazing job vocally with the track and is able to convey just as much emotion as Keys does with the track. He makes it sound as if he really connected with the track or that he wrote it himself. I liked the sound and more rigid/cold feeling of \\"No Curtain Call\\" - it's a bit of a darker sound than the group is usually accustomed to. I actually liked the change in the sound and that the track wasn't entirely peppy, pop or happy and wouldn't have minded if it'd been on he regular edition - though it's different and didn't go with the other tracks, so I get why it was just a bonus track.<br /><br />In all, I felt `Hands All Over' was a good effort. The album feels like it could possibly come from two different recording sessions; the first half of the album features songs that definitely aren't mainstream and have hints of pop, funk and rock and really don't sound like anything you'd expect from Maroon 5. The later half of the album is more typical of Maroon 5 - Levine singing in a sensual manner, Levine hitting high notes, a more standard rock sound. I give props to the group for working with Robert Lange (who's worked with Foreigner, AC/DC, The Cars) because he seemed to push the group into new musical territory without making them sound completely unlike themselves. The group seemed at their best on the more upbeat tracks like \\"Misery\\" and \\"Stutter\\" and when they were channeling a bit of an older style and sound, like on the ballad \\"How\\" and \\"Just a Feeling\\". You're probably fine if you buy the cheaper standard edition but the deluxe does offer the great bonus track \\"No Curtain Call\\" and the Alicia Keys cover \\"If I Ain't Got You\\".<br /><br />Listen to These: \\"Misery\\", \\"Stutter\\", \\"How\\", \\"No Curtain Call\\"gh it's different and didn't go with the other tracks, so I get why it was just a bonus track.

I would not have purchased this had I known it was essentially a comic book.  And any time you put a face on a much beloved character you will run into tons of people who are unhappy with the way he is portrayed.

B003TXKSWK|5.0|Neo Soul crooner John Legend hooks up with Hip Hop collective The Roots to release \\"Wake up!\\", a collection of covers of socially/politically conscious Soul classics from the sixties and seventies. This has been a rather prolific year for The Roots as they released \\"How I got over\\" earlier in the year.<br /><br />Both were inspired by the 2008 United States presidential election and chose songs they felt were obscure. The album has a loose live-jam feel to it with the only Hip Hop infusion being sporadic rapping by Black Thought or guest rappers.<br /><br />The lone original composition is the church piano-driven \\"Shine\\". \\"Humanity (Love the way it should be)\\" is horn-sprinkled Reggae. They eschew the popular songs on Marvin Gaye's \\"What's going on\\" going for \\"Wholy holy\\".<br /><br />Lead-off single \\"Wake up everybody\\" features Common and Melanie Fiona and is light and breezy. \\"Hard times\\" and \\"Compared to what\\" (with an incredibly groovy bassline and funky horns) are Funk/Soul, \\"Little ghetto boy\\" an airy organ-driven Jazz/Soul ballad, while \\"I can't write left handed\\" is a sprawling 12 minute epic, an anti-war lament originally done by Bill Whithers telling the story of a wounded war veteran writing a letter to his mother.<br /><br />Each song stands out really, and what prevents the album from being too depressing and preachy are the excellent vocals and superb musicianship. A much needed wake up call musically.
0971407614|5.0|I had transitioned from going to a gym to do home workouts several months earlier, but I wasn't getting the same gains from my home workouts that I had gotten at the gym. After I started doing the workouts in this book, I realized that my earlier workouts didn't have near the intensity that they needed, and this book showed me how to make them much more thorough and much more intense. Mark offers some very creative ways of replicating gym workouts. Almost every movement that can be done in a gym, on a machine or with free weights, can be replicated at home. I can finally save time by working out at home, AND still get the serious gains that come from truly intense, muscle-blasting workouts hitting every major muscle group. This relatively cheap book is an excellent investment in your health.
B003MZ0I84|4.0|The opening track and lead-off single on Maroon 5's new CD \\"Misery\\" is a deadringer for their earlier hit \\"This love\\", not a bad thing as it is an incredibly catchy danceable Pop/Rock/Soul song which refuses to dislodge itself from your brain. The groovy \\"Give a little more\\" (with MJ-style yelps at the end), \\"Get back in my life\\" and \\"Runaway\\" are more of the same.<br /><br />Title track \\"Hands all over\\" is an edgy rocker, while \\"Never gonna leave this bed\\" is a mellow rocker. The ballad \\"I can't lie\\" is retro soul with a Doo-wop Motown feel, while \\"Out of goodbyes\\" is a lovely Country/pop ballad with Lady Antebellum not unlike what you'd find on a Shania Twain CD. No surprises there seeing as the album is produced by Twain's producer/husband Robert John \\"Mutt\\" Lange.<br /><br />The deluxe edition features 5 additional tracks including acoustic versions of  \\"Never gonna leave this bed\\" (sounding much better and making one realise how over-embelished the original is) and \\"Misery\\", as well as a live cover of Alicia Keys \\"If I ain't got you\\" which is faithful to the original but nice to hear it sung by a guy.<br /><br />\\"Hands all over\\" is a far superior album to their last release \\"It won't be soon before long\\" which was rather patchy, and manages to recapture the magic of their superb debut.

B003TML0VO|3.0|Album number 4 in Santana's career renaissance (since 1999's \\"Supernatural\\") is an album of Rock covers (from The Beatles, Hendrix, to Red Hot Chili Peppers) with the usual armada of high profile guests.<br /><br />Opening is the blistering \\"Whole lotta love\\" with Chris Cornell. The squealing \\"Can't you hear me knocking\\" features Scott Weiland and a light Latin lilt. Rob Thomas appears (once again - he appeared on \\"Supernatural\\" and \\"Shaman\\") on \\"Sunshine of your love\\", while Nas raps on \\"Back in black\\".<br /><br />The albums high points however are the ballads; a tender reading of \\"While my guitar gently weeps\\" featuring India.Arie and Yo-yo Ma with nice tumbling guitars (which apparently got the thumbs up from George Harrison's widow - it's a bit over-produced to me), the Latin-tinged \\"Riders on the storm\\" featuring Chester Bennington & Ray Manzarek (my favourite), the much covered \\"Little wing\\" featuring a gruff soulful Joe Cocker, and \\"Under the bridge\\" featuring Andy Vargas.<br /><br />I miss songs like full out Latin numbers \\"El fuego\\", \\"Primavera\\" or \\"Oye como va\\"\\" and instrumentals like \\"El farol\\" or \\"Victory is won\\", and one can't help but feel this series has started to yield diminishing returns. Santana are beginning to sound like guests on their own records. Might be time to return to what they do best. 3 and a half stars.
B003TML0VO|2.0|Seems like ARISTA Records is becoming the home of veteran artists remaking old and worn out tunes.  Ol Clive Davis has been successful with Barry Manilow and Rod Stewart, so why not Carlos Santana?  GUITAR HEAVEN is essentially karaoke night with Santana playing his guitar over canned tracks, and behind singers who just happened to be in the bar that night.<br /><br />There is nothing new to add to such warhorses as \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\", \\"Smoke On The Water\\", and \\"Back In Black\\".  Perhaps Santana should have covered somewhat well-known but underexposed classic rock songs by superstars.<br /><br />Well there's one good thing about purchasing GUITAR HEAVEN.  You can have a night at the karaoke bar experience at home or in your car without the obnoxious drunks spoiling the fun.  Those cheesy Mitch Miller \\"Sing Along With Mitch\\" albums are more fun than this.
B003WUXU1G|4.0|UK group Skunk Anansie make straight ahead brash but catchy Rock music and \\"Wanderlustre\\", their fourth, is no different.<br /><br />\\"God loves only you\\" finds vocalist Skin alternating from feathery light to fiery following the song intensity. \\"My ugly boy\\" is a driving rocker and there's more where that came from; \\"Over the love\\", \\"It doesn't matter\\" (with a frenetic chorus), the Ska-tinged \\"You're too expensive\\", and \\"Feeling the itch\\".<br /><br />The groovy \\"The sweatest thing\\" reminds me of The Verve with its martial beats, while the pulsing midtempo \\"My love will fall\\" has shades of U2 (and finds Skin singing \\"I curse my love for you\\" - brilliant song) as does \\"You can't always do what you like\\".<br /><br />Slowing things down are the creepy \\"Talk too much\\", the acoustic \\"You saved me\\", and \\"I will stay but you should leave\\".<br /><br />Nice to have Skin (complete with her screech) and the lads back.
0553805371|3.0|Philosophers, theologians and physicists all ask the really big questions, like why do we exist? In the new book, The Grand Design, Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow present a brief and readable perspective on the theories that lead them to conclude that we expect because our planet is in just the right location to support life, and that this could have occurred without any divine intervention. The authors explore the developments in M-theory, a unified set of theories that answer the questions about why the universe behaves the ways it does. As a non-physicist, I found this book readable, although I expect that while I understood the words, I still don't quite get it. Nonetheless, it's rewarding to be exposed to the thinking of these scientists in an accessible way, and to think along with them about those really big questions.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)
B0029O08WA|5.0|Great - great soundtrack. Am I the only one in the world that would prefer the order of the songs on the CD match the order of the songs in the movie? I know they never do on any soundtracks, but I put the songs in the movie order in iTunes, burned the CD and now it's even better!!
B003DKJ5ZU|5.0|My fairy-loving 5 year old daughter and I have adored Disney's Tinkerbell series of movies, and TINKER BELL AND THE GREAT FAIRY RESCUE is no exception.  This movie has all the charm and joy of its two predecessors, and once again, I have to wonder why these movies have been released straight to DVD.  With some of the most gorgeous animation I have ever seen, top-notch voice talent, sincere and honest messages, and a healthy dose of famed Disney magic, TINKER BELL AND THE GREAT FAIRY RESCUE (along with TINKER BELL and TINKER BELL AND THE LOST TREASURE) would have made a mint in the theatres.  These movies make you believe, and really, that is all any of us want.<br /><br />Tinker Bell is back, and this time she and her friends are spending the summer on the human mainland.  Tink is under strict orders to stay away from the humans.  While fairies do a great many things for humans and the human world, rule number one is that humans do not know that fairies really exist.  But the fairies never reckoned on a lonely little girl like Lizzy, before.  You see, Lizzy LOVES fairies; she is one of the few humans who truly believes.  Lizzy builds a fairy house, hoping upon hope to entice a fairy into being her friend (hmmm...sounds like someone else I know!).  Well, guess who can't resist!  Tink ends up befriending Lizzy and teaching her workaholic father lessons about trusting in his daughter and believing with his heart, instead of his head.<br /><br />TINKER BELL AND THE GREAT FAIRY RESCUE is sweet, innocent, and stunning; a delightful tale told by outstanding talent.  The brilliantly superb (I need more superlatives!) animation brings the fairies to life - they seem to fly out of the screen - and the voice actors are some of the very best in the business:  Mae Whitman, who voices Katara in the AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER series, continues to be a perfect choice for Tink. Charming and sincere, she is conveys Tinker Bell perfectly. The talents of Kristin Chenoweth, Lucy Liu, Jessie McCartney, Raven-Symone, and a host of others add to the pleasure of this film. And, as in the previous two films, there is nothing particularly scary in TINKER BELL AND THE GREAT FAIRY RESCUE; nothing that will frighten or upset children. No one dies; no one is particularly evil; there is no bad language. From start to finish, TINKER BELL AND THE GREAT FAIRY RESCUE is cute, appealing, and captivating.  I was grinning from ear to ear during the entire film, and my wee one sat peacefully on my lap throughout.  In fact, she has already rapturously watched this movie five times.  And mom hasn't minded a bit.<br /><br />Disney has a perfect hat trick with these three Tinker Bell movies, including TINKER BELL AND THE GREAT FAIRY RESCUE, and a fourth one is on its way.  Let's hope they can turn that hat trick into a grand slam home run.  Neither my daughter nor I can wait for the next movie; we are already breathless with anticipation.  In the mean time, though, I think we will go build a fairy house on the back porch.  You never know who might come to visit.  After all, all you have to do is believe.  MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED., Raven-Symone, and a host of others add to the pleasure of this film.

B0039UTDFG|1.0|I'm not going to get heated and aggressive about this.  I'm just going to tell it like it is. David Attenborough has been making and narrating natural history videos since the 1950s.  The BBC has the best track record of any natural history unit on the planet.  Most of the \\"groundbreaking\\" specials on Discovery of National Geographic you see are re-makes of BBC originals.  The same is true of \\"Life\\".  And there is no reason for this.  The originals far surpass any remakes.  Find out for yourself.  Skip out on this version, cause you already saw it on the Discovery Channel already.  Buy the original Attenborough version.

1416562605|3.0|The White Tiger is funny enough, at times very funny indeed, but isn't as nourishing as I would expect from a Booker winner. Balram Halwai's journey from the Darkness to his life as a successful (albeit corrupt) entrepreneur is filled with pithy observations about the foibles of the rich and poor. Balram purports to adhere to sacred values, including \\"family comes first,\\" but he deserts his family at every opportunity and eventually becomes an unrepentant killer. Perhaps (as the novel's text suggests) this is a commentary on the \\"new morality\\" in India, but it ultimately makes Balram a difficult character to like. Still, it is possible to like a novel without liking its characters. The novel works well as light humor, a bit less well (for me, at least) as social commentary.  I would give it 3 1/2 stars if I could.
0446563048|4.0|I approached this book with some skepticism - what can I possibly learn from a shoe retailer? Yes, Zappos sold itself to Amazon for around $1 billion and that means Amazon really valued what Zappos had built. I had, over the course of the last few years, heard some good things about Zappos's customer service. But this wasn't going to be enough for me to read another book.<br /><br />After considerable deliberation, I decided to read the book. What a surprise! There was so much to learn from the success of Zappos, it was almost as if Tony Hseih was speaking with me one on one and telling me exactly what I needed to hear. (I was listening to the audiobook narrated by him)<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend reading this book not only to understand how Zappos was built into a great place to work (there are some fascinating stories about Zappos's culture, hiring practices, people management principles, values, etc here) but also to provoke yourself into thinking of how live your life or build up your own workplace.<br /><br />A stimulating and meaningful read!
B003TXKSWK|4.0|Rap royalty and neo-soul star power come together on the fine [[ASIN:B003TXKSWK Wake Up!]], a covers album by The Roots and John Legend.  While 'Wake Up!' doesn't \\"reinvent the wheel\\" by any means, it is an enjoyable and soulful listen, finding both the Roots and Legend at their best.  While the Roots rap contributions are modest here, that is smart considering the tone and the scope of this album.  John Legend sounds among his most soulful ever here, particularly on the best cuts.  There are moments that sag just the slightest bit, but the dynamic moments easily mask the sagging ones.<br /><br />\\"Compared to What\\" opens the album superbly with atmospheric retro-soul production work that possesses an organic quality.  The extended instrumental opening simmers for over a minuter until Legend's soulful vocals enter.  While \\"Compared to What\\" is lengthy, it is quite enjoyable, accentuated even more by the soulful use of organ, trumpet, and saxophone.  \\"Hard Times,\\" similarly, doesn't miss a beat, again beginning with a dramatic opening and the incorporation of a tasteful rap verse.  \\"Little Ghetto  Boy\\" opens with a rap, incorporating The Roots' prodigious rap talents, something that is only subtly appears throughout this album.  The piano work here by Legend is spot on.<br /><br />\\"Wake Up Everybody\\" features fine guest spots by Common and Melanie Fiona. Here, the super collaborative team do a fine job of recreating the Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes classic with some sense of justice.  Similarly, \\"Our Generation\\" shines finding Legend channelling his gospel roots - particularly on the out-tro section (\\"Atlanta...come on Lagos, lets straighten out...) \\"Humanity (Love the Way It Should Be)\\" incorporates reggae and works, though it isn't as \\"epic\\" as say \\"Compared to What\\" or \\"Hard Times\\" or \\"Wake Up Everybody.\\"  \\"Hang On in There\\" is solid, featuring low-key production work that shimmers.  It is \\"I Can't Write Left Handed\\" though that redirects the energy of the album back to the level set early on.  Here, the production work is easily the best of the album and The Roots and Legend truly let loose. Sure, it's over eleven minutes in length, but once you hear it, you will instantly note it is the very best cut of the album.<br /><br />\\"Wholy Holy\\" features understated production work (compared to the overt nature of \\"I Can't Write Left Handed\\").  Here, Legend sounds best as he channels the gospel elements of his voice as far as nuances, phrasing, etc.  \\"I Wish I Know How It Would Feel to Be Free\\" one-ups \\"Wholy Holy\\" cranking up the tempo and finds the super-band all but performing in the church.  The gospel element here is inescapable and one just wishes the cut were longer than its brief duration.  \\"Shine,\\" the only original (penned by Legend) is typical Legend songwriting and closes the album strongly, though not say revolutionarily.<br /><br />As far as the production work and concept,' Wake Up!' is easily the year's most unique R&B album.  The performances are enjoyable, but maybe more enjoyable and awe-inspiring is the atmosphere of the album - the music sounds like it came from the 60's and 70's.  As far as the content, this is a solid (actually better than solid) album, but the lengthiness of the tracks and the occasional \\"over-indulgence\\" sometimes wears on a bit too long.  With that said, there isn't that much to quibble about here; the Roots and Legend do a much better job than most people do making cover albums.  Exceptional effort overall in my eyes.  4 stars.el set early on.  Here, the production work is easily the best of the album and The Roots and Legend truly let loose.

0545310601|3.0|I was disappointed by the conclusion to this great series. I felt like it was anti-climatic, particularly at the end. She could have spent an additional 100 pages building the love triangle. At one point, I read about 30 pages waiting for the \\"and then she woke up from her dream\\" clause. Obviously if you've read the other two, you have to read this one. I just wish the author had taken more time to build the story. I would rather have waited another couple of months to get a better conclusion.
030745455X|5.0|Absolutely excellent! Great writing style, almost like a reading a report but it manages to be exciting while laying out the story almost like detailing facts and sequence of events in an investigation. I could really connect with most of the characters. A truly great experience for me. Great follow-up to the girl with the dragon tattoo.<br /><br />The heroine is one of the best I've come across in years. A must buy if you like crime fiction, thrillers, suspense and a good read.
B002RWKSII|5.0|I love Brian Wilson and I believe his production methods prove wonderfully successful on the Gershwin tunes, however I'm not sure Brian's voice is right for a number of the Gershwin melodies. This became apparent when casually listening, not critically listnening. Its too \\"Brian\\" on \\"Summertime\\" and a few others, although I do love the overall production and impact the album presents, it is flawless. Not sure how casual Brian/Beach Boys fans will take to this, may be too over the top for many. As for me, I love almost everything he does so this is no exeption...
B003V6L94Q|5.0|Song to check out: \\"Colder Weather\\" (track #8)<br /><br />\\"You Get What You Give\\" is another solid album, which again is filled with impressive and widely diverse music.  It's clear that Zac Brown Band refuses to fit into the same mold of most other pop-country groups, as their music is versatile, and sounds much different than anything else on the radio.  Listening to this CD will take you for a wild ride on a musical roller coaster.  Zac Brown Band continues their style of genre blending by throwing in elements of Reggae, Island, Bluegrass, Acoustic Rock -- along with a pinch of Traditional Country.  It has a very laid-back and stripped down style throughout the album, with minimal production.  Their silky smooth harmonies are soothing and very refreshing.<br /><br />Their fresh and pure harmonies are very evident on the first single from the album, \\"As She's Walking Away,\\" which also features vocals and harmony from Alan Jackson.  This huge hit single has lots of sweet fiddle, along with a great melody, and lyrics that almost everyone can relate to.  It has a very traditional feel to it, but at the same time, is breezy and refreshing.  Another colorful song is the crisp \\"Let It Go\\" -- an upbeat and catchy song which is just waiting in line to become a hit single.  Even though it's upbeat, it still has a laid-back and acoustic-driven feel.  One of the most laid-back and carefree songs on the album is the very tropical, \\"Knee Deep\\" -- a song which features Jimmy Buffett, and almost certainly will become a monster summer hit.  It's a bit similar to \\"Toes,\\" but even more catchy, and soothing... close your eyes, and just imagine yourself in your own paradise.  It's a simple song, but perfectly executed.  The amazing and abundant acoustic guitar and fiddle playing throughout the album make it clear that these guys are true musicians.<br /><br />Perhaps the best song on the album is a powerful and haunting ballad, \\"Colder Weather.\\"  This masterpiece of a tune starts with an amazing piano melody, adds a catchy hook, and finishes with their tremendous harmony.  The lyrics are deep, and tell a story of agony that a \\"ramblin' man\\" is facing -- I love you but I leave you / I don't want you but I need you. The fantastic vocals in the song are slightly reminiscent of classic James Taylor style hits.  \\"Colder Weather\\" sounds like a blockbuster hit just waiting to be released.<br /><br />Overall, You Get What You Give is a refreshing CD, loaded with impressively polished harmony.  It seems clear that Zac Brown Band is here to stay -- I think their momentum will only keep on growing, and this will likely become one of the top selling albums of the year.  I'd highly recommend giving this CD a listen, especially if you were a fan of The Foundation.  If it's true that \\"you get what you give,\\" I can see substantial things coming their way, as the Zac Brown Band have given an extraordinary set of songs here!y, adds a catchy hook, and finishes with their tremendous harmony.

0307454541|4.0|What Stieg Larsson has in this first book of the trilogy that makes up the Millennium series is at times shocking, and at times brilliant.  It is books like this that I am left with this sense of reading something bigger than myself.  There is a message within these pages and while it at times is hard to take in and comprehend the horror of things that happen, the book also portrays the strength of the human spirit and what you will find when at the end is the battle of the human spirit to remain free.<br /><br />I would recommend this book with a caution that it is at times graphic and covers harsh topics, yet if you can get past that you will find as you close this book, something remarkable.
B002RT69QQ|5.0|I see that several other reviewers seem to think this item is \\"junk\\".  My thought is that this device has a build quality that is \\"as good\\", if not BETTER, than similarly priced competing products.  It works... fast and FLAWLESSLY.  Given the ZERO shipping cost with Prime membership, I would honestly buy another one (if I lost this one).    PROS:  * No cap to lose!    * The reader has retractable doors on each end that slide-out to protect the male USB jack or any inserted memory cards.  (Did I mention \\"no cap to lose\\"?)  * BONUS - It includes a short USB extension cable for hard to reach USB slots.  (The cable is not depicted in the photo or mentioned in the description, but it was included when I selected Amazon as the seller).  * It mounts as TWO drives.  You can insert an SDHC card AND a MicroSDHC card SIMULTANEOUSLY, and both cards are accessible.    CONS:  * Although it LOOKS like brushed aluminum, it's plastic (like most other portable readers in this price range).  * Slightly \\"bulkier\\" than some other options. (If you don't mind losing caps, or you can accomodate readers with \\"side\\" insertion slots, there are \\"slimmer/trimmer\\" options).
0399156577|5.0|Nora Roberts is at the top of her form.   She writes her Romance/Mysteries in a way that you can tell she has researched her subject matter well - in this case dog training.   Her main characters are likable and believable with the flaws and idiosyncrasies to make them human.  Her minor characters in this novel are also intelligent, bright and one feels  one would want to meet them.   The story is fast moving and not as far fetched as some of her previous books.
0756405890|3.0|I just finished listening to The Name of the Wind, which I had to put down almost a year ago.  It was too hard for me to read, though I made it through with the audio version.  I'm torn over this novel.  It was written well and I liked the characters, but the plot was almost non-existant.    There were whole sequences that could have been told in a chapter or two (Tarbean, the draccus). I can't believe an editor didn't point this out; especially because this is Pat's first book.  It's obvious that Pat doesn't get the whole \\"in late, out early\\" technique... he comes in way before and leaves way after.  And by the end of the book I was left thinking, what, that's it?  Nothing happened!  Oh sure, Kvothe learned some things and fought with another student at school, (aka Potter vs. Malfoy) but there was very little to convince me Kvothe was going to become the most powerful wizard the world had ever seen--other than that he could do anything and everything by pure, natural-born talent.  Please.      I'll give Pat credit for giving Kvothe one glaring flaw: he is the cockiest kid in town.  Kvothe's major character flaw is pride.  I can handle pride--Rand al'Thor becomes very prideful--but it isn't enough of a flaw when Kvothe is perfect in every other way.    On the back of the hardback cover there is a quote from Orson Scott Card.  \\"Not a word of the nearly 700 page book is wasted.  Rothfuss does not pad...\\"  I can't believe OSC said that!  It is the most padded, fluffed, slow-plodding book I've read/listened to this year.  Maybe there was something I missed, but I've read slow books before that kept my interest better than TNotW(Count of Monte Cristo, Wheel of Time books 5-10, Order of the Phoenix).      To sum it up, I'll take a quote right out of the book, from page 597.  \\"But there in that room was the first time I actually felt like any sort of hero.  If you are looking for a reason for the man I would eventually become, if you are looking for a beginning, look there.\\"    We are told not to look for the beginning of Kvothe's grand story, by Kvothe himself, until page 597, out of 662!  Perhaps there should have been something more interesting in the previous pages.    Okay, enough bashing of the book.  Now to the things I liked.  I felt that Pat's writing was superb.  He has a masterful way with language that is very pleasant to listen to.  He is a poet in the making.  And he is great at describing a scene.  I only wish he had spent more time describing exciting scenes.      Pat is also very good at showing the tension between a teenage boy and girl.  Half of the book was pratcially overflowing with frustrated desire between Kvothe and Denna.  It would have been nice if something happened there too.  Just one kiss?  No?  Well, I shouldn't be surprised when nothing happened there either, but it was told well enough that I was mad when nothing happened... that's a good sign.  Pat can make me care about his characters.    One last thing that i really liked.  The magic system was great!  Words and names as tools of power are just cool.  And sympathy is a well-fleshed, smart way to cast spells.  It's obvious that Pat is a very smart man.      The Name of the Wind gets three stars.  I think it was a great first novel, though I'm confussed by the rave reviews it has gotten.  I think too many people are quick to give books they like 5 stars.  I liked this one, and didn't like it.  3 stars is just right.  I will be reading Wise Man's Fear when it comes out.  I am intrigued enough by Kvothe to want more.  I only hope that Pat's editor helps him move a plot along better the second time around.  Patrick Rothfuss is an author to keep an eye on.  Very few authors do there best work at the beginning of their career.  I can't wait to see where Pat is in twenty years.

B003TXKSWK|5.0|OMG! I cannot stop playing this cd. It will go down in history for me as a classic, like Songs in the Key of Life.  Quincy Jones said it best \\"John Legend could be the Stevie Wonder of this generation.\\"  This cd was brilliantly researched, produced, conceived and performed. It is flawless!! John and the Roots Great collaboration.  I met John Stephens 14 years ago when he was a student at U of Penn. and was privy to hear the gift that God had bestowed on him. He was a gracious and humble young man (who also played at my wedding btw). If I had to pick a favorite track I would have to say \\"Hang On in There\\" is most beautiful. If anyone had asked me I would say that it should have been followed by Wholy Holy. But that's just me.  Overall one word \\"Masterpiece\\" sums it up!  Oh and John, make room for some more of those Grammy's.
0143037757|5.0|I took this book with me on a trip to Switzerland and found it fascinating.  The amount of facts, level of research, and breadth of subjects covered is amazing.  And given the scope and length of the book, the author did an incredible job of making it readable.  One of the best history books I have ever encountered.  Don't be turned off by the length, it is worth the effort!

This bookstore was awesome and the book was in perfect condition and had the fastest delivery from Amazon that I have ever received!

B0043N9D76|5.0|This limited edition version of \\"Hands All Over\\" features all 17 songs of the deluxe edition but includes a great DVD with an exclusive inside look at Maroon 5 and the live summer sets of \\"Misery\\" and \\"Give A Little More\\" plus the official music video for \\"Misery\\". Also included is free S.I.N. Fan Club offer as well. This is the ultimate version of \\"Hands All Over\\" album (the Deluxe version plus a great DVD). This is the only CD you need to buy for the latest release from Maroon 5 since it has it all. Was hard to find since it was sold out locally.
B0000X61VE|3.0|This is my all-time favorite workout video. I love the music, love the whole feel of this video. My mother used it while I was growing up (I use to try and do it with her when I was little) and now I use it.  I am at a higher level of fitness now, so I don't use this video as my main source of exercise. I continue to use it because it's so much fun and I can still get a good workout on a \\"off\\" day.  It's a nice workout to incorporate into a regime, but I don't recommend that it's all that you do.
B003MZ0I84|5.0|Excellent effort by Maroon 5 in their third studio album! This album is well-rounded, going from pop music to soul to rock with ease. Adam Levine sounds amazing and the songs' catchy melodies and harmonies only accentuate how far Maroon 5 has grown as a band. Seriously, I've already listened to the CD like 5 times through and I can't say one bad thing about it other than I wish a few of the songs were longer...     As far as getting the Deluxe versus the regular edition, I would definitely recommend the Deluxe version-- the live version of \\"If I Ain't Got You\\" is worth the extra money.

B000P0J0AQ|2.0|\\"The Matrix\\" is a science fiction tale made in 1999.  It is a very popular movie among young as they encounter the riddles, myths, and quest of finding truth and the meaning of life.<br /><br />Thomas Anderson (also known as Neo) is a young, handsome bachelor, living an ordinary life  He is T Anderson by day, a software techie in a bland office cubicle.  By night he is a computer hacker, always alone, feeling he is missing something.  He waits by his home computer at night, waiting for a message, a sign of some sort.  He does not know what he yearns to know.  One night he is told to \\"follow the rabbit\\" - like Alice in Wonderland.  He does not know what it means until some friends come to his door.  He sees a rabbit tattoo on a girl's arm and follows them to a party.  A mysterious woman named Trinity seeks him out at the party and introduces him to a deep voiced, handsome, dark man named Morpheus.  Morpheus sees Neo as special, the one he has been seeking, and shows him the truth about the world.<br /><br />Many dark secrets are exposed as the adventure begins.  Like \\"Alice Through the Looking Glass\\" welcome to \\" The Matrix\\", a fictional universe, full of eclectic settings, electrical pulses and charges,  references to Eastern philosophy, religion, and characters that know the Matrix is not real, it is artificial reality they can manipulate with their minds.<br /><br />Imagination and special effects define the movie.  Laurence Fishburne aptly plays Morpheus, and Carrie-Anne Moss is a thrilling Trinity.  \\"The Matrix\\" morphs into surreal science fiction and then hits \\"earth\\" again with surprises big and small.<br /><br />Overall, \\"The Matrix\\"  reminds me somewhat of the dream movie \\"Inception\\" made in 2010.  It is a fantastic mind controlled escape movie, and the special effects  define it.
B000286RNY|5.0|Shaolin dumplings? Kung fu parking? Hedge-trimming as a martial art? You'll observe all three in Stephen Chow's version of an American sports movie blended with computerized 'action' a la Squinting Dragon Belching Tiger. The story line of \\"Shaolin Soccer\\" is almost exactly parallel to the baseball comedy Major League: a bunch of geeky losers take on the Team Evil champions for the national title. The geeks need a tough talking-to from their revitalized has-been coach, but they \\"man up\\" in time to win. Manning-up requires the last-minute appearance of the dumpling-maker kung fu master, the awkward ugly girl who will win the heart of the 'striker' Iron Leg. The bigshot boss of Team Evil, who has doused his players with \\"American drugs\\", gets his just desserts.<br /><br />Be sure you watch the \\"original Chinese version\\" with English subtitles rather than the dubbed American version.... though that also might be amusing, if the dubbing is as goofy as the subtitling. This is definitely \\"soccer\\" as I'd like to see it played, rather than the drab back-and-forth of the WORLD Cup version that often results in scores of 0-0.
B002ZG99N6|4.0|\\"The Town\\" is directed by and stars Ben Affleck.  It is filmed on location in Boston, which gives a tough real feel to the story.  Everything  falls into place and grabs the audience primarily because of the cast.  It is a basic cops and robbers movie, but the characters give it new life and intensity.  There are exceptional performances by Jeremy Remmer and Rebecca Hall.  All the characters hold up as solid, intelligent and spots of dark humor bubble through.<br /><br />This crime story takes place in Charlestown, the guts of Boston.  Ben plays the genius leader of a gang of bank robbers that the cops have been following, but can't get enough evidence for an arrest.  They dance around the threats and harassment as they continue to plan one big heist after another.  Finally, the FBI task force (led by Chris Cooper from Mad Men)  realize that a former female hostage (Rebecca Hall) is the gang's Achilles Heel.  The FBI zoom in on her and see what she knows.  Initially she does not realize that the man she has been seeing was the gang leader.<br /><br />The film has three heists, and the last heist is at Fenway Park - they enter the cash room dressed as police and steal over $3 million.  There are many good scenes at Fenway Park.<br /><br />It is a standard cops and robber story, but the cast makes this special and worth watching.

0345505387|2.0|I am a real fan of the Outlander series and eagerly await each new release.  I counted the days until this book came out and was excited to see what Diana Gabaldon would do with this new genre.  I was really disappointed.<br /><br />My main gripe with this book is that it was such a superficial treatment of the Jamie and Claire story.  I understand the limitations of the graphic novel genre, but [[ASIN:0439813786 The Invention of Hugo Cabret]] and [[ASIN:0439895294 The Arrival]] proved to me that a great author/illustrator can tell a nuanced story with deep emotional appeal (in the case of The Arrival and The Invention of Hugo Cabret the story is told without the use of any text) in the graphic format.  As much as I hate to say it, Gabaldon and Nguyen fail pretty miserably in this regard.  As much as I adore Jamie and Claire, I was left feeling very ho-hum about them after reading this book and after 224 pages I really don't know anything new about them.<br /><br />Even with my familiarity with the story line, I found the book hard to follow.  There was not enough of a difference in the appearance of Murtagh, Dougal, and Kenneth for me to be certain who was speaking in many frames.  I was looking forward to some unexpected plot twists when the Outlander story was told from Jamie and Murtagh's perspective, but the only thing new as far as I could tell was the Kenneth plotline (which didn't really go anywhere and seemed kind of tacked on).<br /><br />Bottom line, this book makes me really hope that Gabaldon will stick to her gift (which is storytelling in a conventional novel format) from this point forward.  If this is how the Jamie & Claire story is going to be handled in other formats, I _really_ hope that Outlander is never produced as a movie or mini-series.  To have an Outlander movie done as unsuccessfully as this book was would break my heart.
1878424319|5.0|This book is amazing,it has a mind opening way to see how we judge ourselves and others by our inner voice(conscious)when were missing the big picture.

B002LBKDYE|5.0|I had no idea about where my food came from or why it mattered before watching this. Very educational and entertaining.
0066620996|1.0|I got to page 7, where they listed the 11 'carefully selected' companies that the book's management theories are based off of.  Circuit City - BANKRUPT. FANNIE MAE, you've just GOT to be kidding me! - This was a government sponsored entity to begin with, and since their HUGE contribution to the housing bubble, the government fully owns all of their debt!     To be fair, this was written in 2001, and the study was done over the 5 years before that. But these failed \\"Great Companies\\" seem to add much discredit to the study and the theories. There were several reviews about the poor study methods, and it seems that to put a government-sponsored entity as 1 of the 11 companies in the study is definitely a flawed approach.
B001MVYUPC|4.0|Gandhi is a powerful movie about the iconic leader Mahatma Gandhi who was responsible for leading a nonviolent resistance against the rule of the British. The film is a true story that takes place in both South Africa and India during part of the 20th century.  It starts off with the assassination of Gandhi in 1948 then fades to a train in South Africa where Gandhi is thrown off for sitting in first class, where he was not allowed to sit because he was considered a colored man. This leads Gandhi to start a nonviolent resistance for the rights of Indians living in South Africa. After being jailed numerous times and beaten publicly, Indians were finally granted rights within South Africa. Gandhi decides to move back to his homeland where he is greeted as a hero. After returning to India Gandhi is asked to lead a revolution against the local rule of the British crown. He accepts and a nationwide revolution of nonviolent resistance is formed. Millions of Indians and Muslims join in one accord to revolt against Brittan and while there were killings of Indians and Gandhi was thrown in jail numerous times the revolution was working drawing attention from all over the world. When national tension broke out between the Muslims and the Indians Gandhi went on a hunger strike that severely weakened him. The hunger strike paid off as peace broke out across the nation. The revolution pays off with Brittan granting India is independence after heavy political pressure and world attention. Against Gandhi's wish a portion of India where Muslims were the majority was cut off and formed into Pakistan. Gandhi spent his time trying to bring peace between the nations; because of this some people grew to dislike Gandhi. This hatred is what leads to the death of Gandhi in 1948 when he is murdered. Gandhi was mourned by hundreds of millions of people worldwide at the time of his death in 1948. This movie is a powerful insight into the world of India. It shows the struggles that some religions and cultures have gone through over history to not only be treated as equals but have the freedom to govern their own lands.  It also takes a look into the intolerance that some cultures/religions have against others and the injustices they endure because of what they believe. Gandhi also shows that with time and patients anything is possible and not everything has to be solved in bloodshed. Overall it was a great movie.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|The first two books in this series were amazing. They built up so much potential for the finale, sadly very little of that was realized. The book seemed rushed, especially the last few chapters, Collins introduces characters in this book only to build them up then kill them off for the sake of saving all of her main characters. I was hoping so bad for this to be an epic tale of rebellion and war but it turned out most the book was just Katniss, the main character, wallowing in a combination of self hatred and self pity. Oh well i will remember the first two books very fondly and try to forget this one.

B002ZG997C|1.0|Teen Christian geek story - one gets to maim and kill evil people while on a mission for God in a post-apocalyptic United States.  The unattainable, beautiful, worldly-but-good girl offers herself to you, you decline her favors nobly, and in the end, rescue her from the evil that surrounds her.  The \\"others\\" are undeniably evil, through and through, and scary enough to make them worthy foes for your superhuman martial arts skills.  Since they are unredeemable, it isn't a sin but a duty to slaughter them in droves, once they force you to kill again.  At the end you complete your mission and provide an element essential to the future redemption of the world.  Your chief enemy, the only one who wasn't a moron, gets his comeuppance.  After you die, the beautiful, worldly-but-good girl, whose previous life skills were limited to remembering where the water was stored, is mystically transformed (by your Christian nobility) into a warrior princess who ventures alone back into darkness.  Sequel, anyone?    Oh, yes, and a twist or two at the end that one could see a mile off.    Cardboard characters, no human motivation or character development in evidence.    A lot of very talented actors in a story that's been overdone and better done in multiple Westerns and martial arts films and, even, video games.

0545310601|1.0|I'll be brief:  this book has nearly killed the series for me. I say don't read this book because it kills the series, I say don't start the series because you won't be able to resist reading this book in the hopes of finding some closure that, ultimately, doesn't exist.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT<br />SPOILER ALERT<br />SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />The first two books were pure GENIUS.  Fast paced, exciting, suspenseful, and, above all, satisfying.  The ending of the third book was horrible, and not just because it wasn't a happy ending.  Let me be blunt: by the end of the story, I was fed up with Katniss being such a wuss. I understand that she'd been through hell and back, but it got really, really old.  The \\"I don't remember how I got here, but I wound up curled into a ball in the laundry room only able to hear someone crying with a vague understanding that it was probably me who was crying\\" was used to perfection in the first two books, but by now is literally every third page.  Peeta is absent, Gale's character is flattened out to just a revenge-seeking maniac, Haymitch is never around, and the only likable character--Boggs--dies unceremoniously by an errant mine.  What?  Finnick could pass as someone really likeable, but even he dies too, even LESS ceremoniously.  After his death he isn't mentioned again EVER.  It's like he was just some minor character.  And as for the conclusion of the plot itself--the execution of Snow--how hurried was that?  She kills Coin, is whisked away, and then sent to District 12 where she continues to be a wuss, decides to love Peeta, grows up, has children, continues to be a wuss, and no one else is ever heard from again, not Haymitch, not Gale, not Katniss's mother, no one. AND THIS ALL HAPPENS IN LESS THAN 20 PAGES.  Seriously?  This felt entirely unsatisfying.  Not only was the nihilistic, woe-is-me attitude of the book off-putting and depressing, it lacked any real sense of closure.  To the people who would say \\"well that's what war does!\\" kindly stop talking and leave.  Everyone already knows war sucks.  And by the way, why the HELL did Prim have to die?  Did Katniss REALLY need any more excuse to go emo?  She'd been doing that pretty effectively well before that.<br /><br />It's a damn shame the first two books are so mind-numbingly genius only to be COMPLETELY RUINED by this one. I don't even want to own this book anymore.  I read it in two days--I will say it's just as gripping as the previous two--so I'll be returning it to the store tomorrow.king and leave.

0345505387|4.0|Hoang Nguyen has managed to do the impossible: create a Jamie who is at once masculine, beautiful, and, where appropriate, amused.  At the same time he has created a strong and seductive Claire.  And of course, no one knows her own characters and their dialogue better than Diana Gabaldon.  In keeping with the start of the tale, Jamie and Claire are young. But you can already see in Mr. Nguyen's creations how they could mature.  The story may be a little difficult to follow for those who are not already familiar with the Outlander novels.  But my husband's eager to read it too.    Ms. Galbadon and Mr. Nguyen, I've two words to say:  More please!

B00005K3O0|1.0|More of A Thriller than a Horror movie,or SuperNatural Horror. It does indeed ride on The Exorcist,Anthony Hopkins Is Great. But...The Movie is boring and full of New Age touchy feely Consumer Pick and Choose Religion Typical of America.
B003EY7IUY|4.0|I loved all of Sophie's books.  It picks yo up after a long day at work and good for a few laughs.
B001MYIXAW|5.0|I can only say the casting of the children in this movie is so right. It's an interesting take on a well worn story. Except it's more a character study than a horror movie. yes it has a few gory parts but the special effects don't take away from the heart of this vampire fairy tale. Well worth watching and the copy I got from Amazon had the correct subtitles. I could watch it twice in a row , the first time  with sub-titles and the second time with the dubbed soundtrack and enjoy both versions . Thats a good sign for a great story. Just watch it, I'm sure it will blow  away Let Me In, thats the American version of this flick. Just for the casting alone. The little Girl is so good as a young actor. A vampire worth saying come in to as her heart is much more honest than the humans in this movie :)
B001ILHY2C|5.0|I haven't seen the original, however this should be an instant classic for Twisted Metal and Full Auto fans! The movie is very fun and utilises the common good vs evil in a fun and destructive way. This went under the radar like Full Auto 1 & 2 but I believe it deserves 5 stars for a mad max style adventure that is hard to find. Hopefully we will see Full Auto: Death Race come out soon, along with a sequel in theatres with the main cast!
B0013D8LCW|4.0|I first saw shelter about 2 years ago as part of a gay film festival here in South Africa, and my original reaction was amazement, I immediately ordered the DVD and took everyone I knew to see it. I have since watched the film many times at home, again introducing as many people as I could to it.     My opinion of the film has, since recently, changed ever so slightly though.    I'm not sure the film was nearly as brilliant as i (and judging by the reviews on Amazon everyone else who saw it) thought it was.    If you think about it, the story isn't that original, virtually every gay film of the last 10 years sings the same tune. And while Shelter is better executed than most other films of this genre (both gay and straight), its inherent weakness shows as the film caves in on itself mid way (as soon as the first obstacle arises)     Despite this, I do still believe that Shelter is worth seeing, as mentioned, the film is well made. The direction in the first half is sturdy, the cinematography, although hardly sublime, places you as the viewer in the perfect mood, and I loved most of the music used. The actors did exactly what was necessary to pull Shelter off, and after watching, it feels as though they are still there.     Most importantly the characters are well written, something that is tragically missing in most films of this kind.       So buy it, you won't regret it!
B000LAZDQA|2.0|I was prepared to really enjoy this film. About half-way through, I realized that beneath the graphic sex, the plot was very thin and most of it was for mainstream shock value. Skip this one and re-watch \\"Last Tango\\". At least it had mulitudes to say. This, sadly, has little going for it.
B0001HLVSC|5.0|This is an adventure like no other.  I bet on a big screen you would feel like you were there with the crew on this ship.  The acting is excellent.

B003TML0VO|1.0|I have been grappling with how to go about reviewing this album, but I think all I can say is that this is an utter trainwreck. I have never been very impressed with Carlos Santana's playing, I think perhaps it's somewhat a stylistic-preference thing, but in general I think he's a bit over-rated. [My personal favorites of this era are Page, Gibbons, Gilmour, Angus & Malcom Young, Lifeson.] Having said that, I was curious to see what he'd do with these seminal guitar-oriented songs. After listening, I was speechless with how bad it all was. It's not that Santana is a bad player, he's clearly talented for the style he normally plays. I think the problem is with the song selection and the arrangements. And of course, having the audacity to proclaim this as a tribute to guitar classics, when it's really just a Santana cover album.     Here we have some of the seminal guitar-oriented classic rock songs of the last 40 years and, more to the point, some of the greatest guitar RIFFS ever recorded [I am a rhythm guitarist, so I am all about the riffs]. The problem comes when despite this being billed as \\"The Greatest Guitar Classics Of All Time\\", Santana seems to ignore some of the signature riffing of these songs for latin beats and his trademark flourishes. For many of the songs, it felt like the backing band was handling the rhythm parts, which I found hard to reconcile with a homage to guitar classics. Case in point; AC/DC's uber-riff \\"Back In Black\\". How turning the monstrous heavy groove that Malcom and Angus deliver with their dual-guitar assault into a mish-mash of hip-hop with latino flourishes is paying tribute to the original is simply beyond me. But, to be fair, critiquing that one is picking the low-hanging fruit. There's the guitar riff every beginning guitarist learns: \\"Smoke On The Water\\". Although this one starts off with promise [I recalled thinking, \\"This is more like it!\\"], this too quickly devolves into something altogether different. Same for the opener\\"Whole Lotta Love\\" [a ballsy choice to start off with, considering how it ends up being handled]. Though widely considered the \\"mother of all guitar riffs\\", Santana seems to give Page's classic riff short-shrift. [At least for that one, Chris Cornell delivers a worthy vocal performance]. Not that re-interpretation is bad, but there's a difference between just doing covers and supposedly paying tribute.     And then, in a class all it's own, is the real travesty: \\"Little Wing\\". Probably one of the most beautiful guitar pieces ever written in any genre, and only successfully covered [some might argue even bettered] once. No one should ever try and cover \\"Little Wing\\" again. The only cover to ever do it justice was by Stevie Ray Vaughn, and I'm sorry, he may have been around for a lot longer, but Carlos Santana is NOT in the same league. Despite Joe Cocker's valiant attempt at the vocals, I found that one basically unlistenable [I went and put on SRV's and it's enough to make you want to cry in comparison].     I could go on and on about each song, but it's not worth the time. Do yourself a favor; if you aren't already familiar with these songs, just make yourself a compilation of the originals. Your money will be better-spent.
B0036EH40Q|5.0|I love this movie its easily my favorite western of all times. Wyatt Earp is the man and Doc Holliday is hilarious. Great cast and a western classic in my mind
B003XJDT1W|5.0|it's finally here & does not dissappoint.  i think this is a stronger album than The Foundation.  the energy, musicianship & singing never lets up whether it's fast or slow songs.  however, this album doesn't have songs with the cuteness of Chicken Fried, Sic Em on a Chicken, or Toes.    the innovations in this cd is in the virtuoso singing & playing.  for me the stand out is the 11 minute jam of Who Knows, where the band stretch out & really show their chops.  i hope future albums will have more long songs, which would move them closer to Allman Brothers heights rather than just first rate country.    Whiskey's Gone is the closest cousin to the 3 fun songs off The Foundation, but not as instantly catchy as those.  however many of the songs will be radio friendly such as Let it Go, Knee Deep & the first single As She's Walking Away.    it'll take more listenings to absorb all the riches of this cd, but after the first day & 3 plays, i'm already impressed.

B003DKJ5ZU|5.0|First off, I congratulate the Disney organization on the reasonable pricing of its Blu-ray(tm)/DVD combos and on providing with each both a film and special features that really are special.<br /><br />With regard to this film, I believe it is the third in a series that features Tinker Bell in title and story line. It is also a prequel to her first encounter with Wendy and the Lost Boys in Peter Pan. In fact, this is her first encounter with human beings.  Adults will recognize several basic themes that Disney has used in animated films at least since Snow White: a youth (puppet, step sister, elephant, princess, etc.) is either separated from family or feels neglected, if not disliked; imminent danger and the need for protection or rescue; the power of faith; and the true meaning and importance of friendship. All are basic to this film and developed with a light but sure touch.<br /><br />Others have already praised the production values (i.e. quality of image, clarity of sound, and verisimilitude to human experience) and, frankly, I now take them for granted when watching animated feature films produced by Disney, its Pixar group, or Dreamworks. With regard to the celebrity voices, they include Michael Sheen (Dr. Griffiths), Mae Whitman (Tinker Bell), Kristin Chenoweth (Rosetta), and Lucy Liu (Silvermist) but for me, they may as well be any other actors so long as the voices are appropriate to the given characters. The aforementioned four are.<br /><br />I concede that the plot in this film and others in the Peter Pan/Tinker Bell sequence and other Disney Classics (Snow White, Pinocchio, Dumbo, and Bambi) are simple but think they should be just as plots in  fairy tales are simpler than those in the novels of Henry James, Leo Tolstoy, and James Joyce whose primary objective was not to entertain children.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is one of Disney's most effective films as it fully achieves that objective. Those who purchase it will appreciate the value-added benefits of the \\"bonus\\" features that include deleted scenes, a new (rather than recycled) video \\"How to Believe,\\" \\"Design a Fairy House,\\" and \\"Fairy Field Guide Builder.\\" Those who purchase this film can also obtain a free charm bracelet with Tinker Bell charm by going online with a request, accompanied by the Magic Code provided in the package.res that include deleted scenes, a new (rather than recycled) video \\"How to Believe,\\" \\"Design a Fairy House,\\" and \\"Fairy Field Guide Builder.\\" Those who purchase this film can also obtain a free charm bracelet with Tinker Bell charm by going online with a request, accompanied by the Magic Code provided in the package.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Watched the DVD as soon as I got it and was surprised at how much I still loved it after all this time, not having seen it since its initial release, because I've read nothing but bad reviews over the years.  Jar Jar is definitely an annoyance, but all in all, I found it exciting and beautiful to look at.
B003MZ0I84|5.0|The album does not disappoint.  I think I hear a little more MJ influence this time around but with the Maroon 5 twist.  Really shows the continual evolution of the band.  A particular highlight of the deluxe is the Alicia Keys cover which is vocally extraordinary.  The Misery acoustic is quite unique as well.  Bottom line- I highly recommend the Deluxe edition.
B003HKF8EI|4.0|Some years ago I connected with the suicide project in Switzerland. When given the choice to linger or get out I choose to get out. PBS has a DVD on the subject entitled \\"Suicide Tourist\\". Morrie lingering validated my choice for me. Thank you Morrie for telling your story so I could be emphatically clear in not taking your path.
0847830942|5.0|Historically, the sport of cycling has suffered from a poor press, especially in the English language.  Cycling books have tended to be either annuals devoted to a racing season, short biographies of famous cyclists, training manuals or modest picture books.  The mediocre quality of cycling books was probably due the sport's modest roots.  Cycling was once a major sport in the United States, especially on the high banks of the indoor velodromes, where track races drew thousands of spectators to places like the original Madison Square Garden, which was actually constructed for cycling.  Cycling's period of popularity on this side of the Atlantic lasted from the 1880's through the early 1930s. However, as cars became an affordable and efficient form of transportation and recreation, popular interest in cycling faded. Finally, it was the Great Depression that seemed to put the last nail in the sport's coffin. Eventually, bicycles came to be thought of as children's toys and bicycle racing was seen as an eccentric European sport and its deep roots in American culture were almost completely forgotten.      Despite the size of the United States book market, for many years, there were few cycling books to chose from and the offerings that did exist were modest efforts from specialized publishers. Interestingly, things were not a lot better for the literate cyclist abroad.  In Europe, there were sports like rowing, motor racing, horse racing and yachting for the upper crust and so during the postwar years, football and cycling were seen as sports for lower class participants.  Lavish books like those  produced for yachting or motor racing were rare or non-existent, even for continental cyclists.  Fortunately, the quality of cycling books is changing, both in the United States and Europe.  As cycling has become more attractive to the affluent, there has been an increasing market for well-produced cycling books. After all, an enthusiast who can afford a bicycle that costs asmuch as a good used car can afford a book that costs fifty or seventy-five dollars for the coffee table.    One of these beautiful new \\"coffee table\\" cycling books is The Golden Age of Handmade Bicycles, a stunning production devoted to the exquisite mounts of French Cyclotourists of the 1930s.   Even a veteran bicycle racing enthusiast with a solid knowledge of the sport will find some of the bicycles here a revelation!  This is because most of us whose knowledge and interest in cycling began with competitive cycling have never mixed a great deal with the touring crowd.  Historically, there was little overlap between the touring rider and the competitive cyclist.  To the racer, riding may be enjoyable, but ultimately, the countless miles on the bike, serve a purpose and that is to prepare for races.  Even after a competitive rider stops racing, his riding may have a social aspect, but he remains a competitive person. Riding still revolves around gaining or maintaining fitness rather than just seeing the countryside at a good clip.      This tourist/racer divide also existed in Europe and the most interesting aspect of this division between cycling sportsmen was that racing bicycles and touring bicycles evolved and developed on parallel tracks, with the technology of touring bikes actually advancing more rapidly than that of racing bikes. This will be the major revelation from this book for racers... that the technical development of the bicycle did not begin with our patron Saint, Italy's Tullio Campagnolo.  While most of us tend to think that it would be racing that would lead the way to superior materials, construction and components, this was not the case in Europe in the years following World War I.  It was actually cyclotourists, riders who rode great distances for pleasure that pioneered many great advances in the development of the bicycle.  Racing bicycle development was hindered by a retrograde mindset that is unfortunately, still with us, the minimum weight for U.C.I. sanctioned races being just one sterling example.      In 1920s France, which was slowly recovering from the devastation of four years of war, automobiles were still relatively expensive to buy and, then as now, the petrol to run them didn't come cheap.  At the same time, there was a growing lower middle class who was beginning to enjoy their time off.  Even a factory or service workers could save up and buy a nice bicycle.  So, voila, the bicycle became the device that tens of thousands of French men, women and children used to explore their beautiful country.  Every summer, families packed their velos with tents, spare clothing and, because this is France, cooking implements, and they pedaled off to a week or two of sweaty leisure.    By the time velo tourisme was hitting its stride, the \\"diamond\\" frame had already been the standard of bicycle construction for several decades.   Chain-driven and equipped with two wheels of the same diameter, which enabled the rider to carry spare tires and tubes of a single size, the diamond-framed bike enabled the rider to cover great distances efficiently.  Furthermore, it could be made on a small scale by custom builders or put into assembly line production, with both types of bike builders able to use interchangeable components, making bicycles affordable and replacement parts readily available.  The bicycle of the 1920s was relatively light, easy to ride, didn't require much space to store and, once mounted, the rider was high enough to be visible to the automobiles and motorcycles he had to share the road with.   All these qualities made the traditional diamond-framed bicycle the standard choice for cyclists of early 1900s as it remains today.    The transformation of the bicycle from a device for transportation and local recreational rides to a human-powered vehicle that could be ridden long distances over almost any terrain was in large part due to the efforts of a man named Paul de Vivie, the mustached Prometheus of the cyclo-touring movement. De Vivie became a cycling enthusiast in the 1880s and he often rode hundreds of kilometers at a stretch, which gave him plenty of time to wish for improvements in the primitive single speed bicycles of the day.  He soon began writing under the pen name Velocio and he became a poetic advocate for paid vacations for all Frenchmen and the leading proponent of cyclotourism.  Something of an Anglophile, de Vivie was a member of the Cycling Tourists Club in Britain, imported mass-produced English bicycles to France and published the landmark French magazine Le Cycliste.  By 1889 de Vivie became a manufacturer, creating the La Gauloise brand and then, in search of a better method of climbing inclines through changing the gear ratio, he invented the \\"BI-Chain\\" system and created one of the first primitive derailleurs.  The philosophy of Velocio permeated the early years of cyclo-touringin France:    After a long day on my bicycle, I feel refreshed, cleansed, purified. I feel that I have established contact with my environment and that I am at peace. On days like that I am permeated with a profound gratitude for my bicycle. Even if I did not enjoy riding, I would still do it for my peace of mind. What a wonderful tonic to be exposed to bright sunshine, drenching rain, choking dust, dripping fog, rigid air, punishing winds! I will never forget the day I climbed the Puy Mary. There were two of us on a fine day in May. We started in the sunshine and stripped to the waist. Halfway, clouds enveloped us and the temperature tumbled. Gradually it got colder and wetter, but we did not notice it. In fact, it heightened our pleasure.     The Golden Age of Handbuilt Bicycles is a wonderful pictorial guide to dozens of French manufacturers of touring bicycles.  One was the mass-market company  Hirondelle, which boasted 5,000 employees at its peak.  Their affordable Retro-Directe model, marketed from 1903 to 1939, used a primitive gear changing methodthat wound the chain in a figure eight around a set of two freewheels.  In contrast to the mass-produced bikes, there were custom builders like the innovative Jacques Schultz, who anticipated monocoque construction with his single-backbone frame with a one large diameter tube.  He also created an early indexed derailleur system and his own pedals.      In 1934, a group of enthusiasts created the Groupe Montagnard Parisien, which translates to the Mountaineer Group of Paris.  These were riders who were not interested in simply riding on flat or rolling terrain, but in climbing over the steep alpine pass.  This organization created a \\"Concours de Machines\\" or \\"Test of Machines\\" which meant a series of technical trials that served as motivation for manufacturers to create lighter weight, more responsive bicycles that climbed more efficiently.  So, soon constructors like A.I. Reiss from Lyon were creating bicycles with full touring equipment - lights, fenders, pump - that weighed less than 25 pounds.  These lightweight bikes enabled riders to climb much faster and even featured improved brakes than could arrest the speed of a plunging bicycle more rapidly because there was less mass to stop.    In 1936, the French union movement achieved their goal of a 40 hour work week and two weeks of paid vacation and this led mass-market companies like Charles Longoni to create singles and tandems that were affordable for the growing movement of cyclotourists.  Unfortunately, World War II began in 1939 and it wasn't until after another long war that cyclotouring could make a real comeback.  Some of the most beautiful bicycles in this book are ones made by the acclaimed builders Rene Herse, A. Faure and Alex Singer, all of whom created wonderfully detailed, hand-brazed frames with their own hand-crafted racks and lightweight components that were screwed into beautifully brazed-on mountings rather than clamped to the frame.  These bicycles, which could weigh less than twenty pounds,featured \\"drilled out\\" components, \\"engine turned\\" surfaces and the frames were often plated in stunning nickel alloy. The book concludes with a fascinating series of bikes from the 1950s and 1960s from the established custom builders that were created for specialized uses like commuting, deliveries and bicycle messenger services and then finally, with examples of the current French cyclotouring bicycles.     Some of the most stunning examples of the bicycle-builder's art were produced for the Councours de Machines and a number of these bikes have survived in remarkable condition and are featured in The Golden Age of Handmade Bicycles.  Each of the bicycles was shot by photographers Jean-Pierre Praderes and Eric Svoboda and have been reproduced on a white background. There is a great amount of detail in the medium-format photographs, detail that both enthusiasts and frame builders will enjoy.  There are also a number of historic images that help illuminate the eras when the bicycles were produced.      And, these historic cyclotouring bikes have had a profound influence on a number of the artisans that are part of the new handmade bicycle movement.  Builders like Sacha White, Bruce Gordon, Robin Mater and Peter Weigle are not only crafting their own frames, but, like the French constructors before them, creating their own stems, handlebars, racks and other accessories, an assemblage of beautifully-formed function.  To the handmade movement, the humble bicycle is a vehicle for innovation and a means of self-expression.    The author of this 168 page book is Seattle-based writer Jan Heine is the mover behind Bicycle Quarterly, which is the bible of the modern American cyclo-touring movement.  This volume was originally published under the Vintage Bicycle Press imprint, but it was re-published in 2009 by the art publisher Rizzoli and that should make it more widely available.   The Golden Age of Handbuilt Bicycles also features contributions from Neville and Helen March who are prodigious Bordeaux-based collectors of historic bicycles and Raymond Henry, a cyclotourist who heads the Cultural Heritage Commission of the French Federation of Cyclotouring.  The writing is fine and clear, with just enough detail on each bicycle and builder and the chronological format creates a narrative of bicycle development.      My only criticisms are that I would have liked to see technical data for each bicycle in an index, including the materials used, with the size and weight of the frame and the components.  Exact frame specifications would also be a good addition as I am sure this data would be welcomed by bicycle builders who would like to know the actual wheelbase, top tube length, rake and trail of each frame.  In conclusion, with The Golden Age of Handbuilt Bicycles, Heine and his contributors have created a stunning monument to the passionate enthusiasts and wonderful craftsmen who helped drive bicycle development and innovation.
0316098337|4.0|I ducked into a bookstore to escape the rain, and picked up basically the first book that caught my attention. I hadn't planned to actually read anything, but the first few sentences grabbed me, and I just kept reading. It was definitely a page turner, and the perspective of the child was always interesting to read, didn't get too clunky or tiresome. A fantastic book!
B003QCCS36|3.0|Look, there's absolutely nothing wrong with this album. It's actually a great choice for someone wishing to start listening to this great singer/songwriter.    But for those of us who've been listening to Ray for a while, it's simply more of the same.    I really hope he doesn't get caught in the Ben Harper trap, whereby he becomes less interesting with each new release. I sincerely hope he doesn't get caught in the Jack Johnson trap, whereby he doesn't change AT ALL with each new release.    But hey, Harper and Johnson are very successful and Ray deserves to have an easier living making quality music so who am I to complain if he cracks the big one with less adventurous recordings?    It would seem that one leads to the other anyway...

0765322889|2.0|I have read several of the other reviews that tell new readers that they will begin to pick up an understanding of the Malazan world as they go through volumes 2 and 3. I don't remember ever having to do such a thing with any other writer. George RR Martin is clear, JRR Tolkien is too. What frustrates me, I think, is that Erikson makes leaps between the facts he does choose to give his readers. The reader has to stop to figure out what info has been left out, and then reread because there isn't enough data to fill in the gaps. By the time I was a third the way through Gardens, I had bare sketches of a large world that was mostly blank. Frustrating. Also, I would say that his phrasing is often awkward and convaluted, thus making the reader go back and reread for a second reason.     I would basically say that he's not worth the price of a used version. Harsh, I know, but my money is valuable to me!
B000UCEJEQ|5.0|She could be the greatest woman singer of all time!  Love her voice, her talent, everything about her.  She is just beautiful inside and out!!!!
0345505387|2.0|I waited patiently for the release date and rushed to the local store on my lunch hour.  I picked it up flipped through it, put it down, picked it up, and put it down again.  I am a HUGE fan of this series.  I spread the excitment to all who will listen and am heartfully thanked by those that do.  I have every book, but this one is strange. I thought random pictures throughout with written story.  I was so wrong.  Should I add it to the collection or would it ruin the world I see when I read about Jamie and Claire? Maybe one day, or maybe not.  As Claire would say \\"Bloody Hell\\", what was she thinking...?  I will patiently await the next in the series (not too long I'm hoping) this has not swayed my loyalty to Diana G. and the Outlander series.
B003TML0VO|2.0|I had made up my mind to purchase this cd when I heard about the concept, and bought it despite the negative reviews (one out of four stars in USAToday).  It's not terrible, but the songs don't improve on the originals and don't bring any Santana flavor.  There are only a couple of cuts that you can listen to and immediately identify Santana's guitar.  He sounds like a session musician on his own disc.  While My Guitar Gently Weeps is good, and the album ends with a nice 1-2 punch of Little Wing and I Ain't Superstitious, but that's it for the highlights.  I wonder how much input, if any, Carlos had on song selection.  This project sounds like a money grab or a fulfillment of a contractual obligation.  When I listen to Nas on Back in Black, I can only wonder how much better a choice Run-DMC's Rock Box would have been, with Carlos playing Eddie Martinez' ferocious guitar lines.  Shoot, there are even better cover versions out there of some songs - Living Colour's version of Sunshine of Your Love from the True Lies soundtrack smokes this one.  I really didn't think Carlos Santana had this album in him...and I DON'T mean that in a good way!
0345505387|4.0|I am pretty amazed at the comments people are leaving about the GN.  Diana has made it clear from the beginning what it was, has provided sample pictures, sample pages...did you guys really think she'd written one of her dictionary-sized novels?  Perhaps you need to pay a little more attention next time.  I'm sorry if that sounds condescending, but really, she couldn't have made it more plain.<br /><br />I don't have very many GNs myself - I own two, written during the old 1980's Beauty and the Beast TV show days (Portrait of Love and Night of Beauty, both by Wendy Pini), so I knew what to expect.  And I wasn't disappointed.  What gorgeous, lush artwork!  My favorite picture of Jamie is the one of him looking around Angus with that grin and devilish wink.  That's exactly how I pictured him back in 1995 when I first read Outlander.  I had issues with Claire's boobs, but then again, it's a man's artwork, and Claire IS described as having a voluptuous figure.  On the other hand, I shouldn't argue; Jamie's figure is pretty freaking awesome, and I thank you, Mr. Nguyen, for that.<br /><br />I do agree with some of the posters that the dialogue seems rather skimpy if you already haven't read Outlander.  But really, folks, would you purchase this if you hadn't already been a fan of Diana's series and know the stories pretty much by heart?  That being said, I thought it was very well-written and easy to follow.  I really appreciated all the Gaelic translations; I absolutely loved Jamie's thoughts when he was comforting Claire in front of the fire (sigh!) - and I cracked up at Claire's unspoken thoughts about the bird hovering over her teacup in Colum's office.  Well done, Diana!  Perhaps there will be an Exile Part Two, so we can see Lallybroch, Jenny, and Ian?  One can only hope!

B003TML0VO|2.0|This is what it sounds like when a legend phones it in.<br /><br />In spite of what some have said, Carlos Santana's last couple records were not total washouts, and \\"Supernatural\\" does not deserve derision by any means. In fact, it still holds up a solid decade later.<br /><br />The problem is that nothing sounds impassioned, organic or genuine on \\"Guitar Heaven: The Greatest Guitar Classics of All Time,\\" whether it be Santana's playing - which, for the most part, sounds merely pleasant and semi-rote - and the vocal contributions of the singers who make guest shots.<br /><br />The realization that this record is from a man who played Woodstock is, frankly, saddening.<br /><br />The song selections are not always so hot, either, and when they are - whether it's the immortal \\"Riders on the Storm\\" from the Doors or the inescapable brilliance of Deep Purple's \\"Smoke on the Water\\" - the results almost exclusively sound like top-notch karaoke than worthy covers.<br /><br />Half the material here may be songs so evergreen that they sell themselves, but this also works against Santana and his vocalists - they fight an uphill battle to put any stamp of originality on these covers.<br /><br />Santana only deserves criticism for consenting to do this project. The original idea to do a record of classic rock covers was that of record industry titan Clive Davis. He has been a shrewd businessman and a fine tastemaker throughout his career, but his strategies have primarily concerned what would sell, not what would sound good or have integrity behind it. Thirty years ago he took Melissa Manchester, who crafted idiosyncratic, adult-oriented pop, and forced her to sing maudlin adult contemporary ballads and, eventually, embarrassing bubble gum, all written by \\"hit makers.\\" He has often compromised careers while in search of a buck. \\"Guitar Heaven...\\" is just the latest example.<br /><br />Song after song this sounds like grocery store intercom muzak, with rare exception. Chris Cornell attempts to pump life into Led Zeppelin's \\"Whole Lotta Love,\\" although he sounds recorded separately from Santana, which he probably is - this is music by assembly line. India.Arie and Yo-Yo Ma, unsurprisingly, sound lovely on the Beatles' \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps.\\"  Gavin Rossdale and Santana also gel well on T. Rex's \\"Bang a Gong.\\"<br /><br />For the most part the selections are inescapably calculated and passionless. Santana's sound has not changed in years. Every note can be predicted three songs in advance. Even ice cream can get boring. Record buyers deserve better.otta Love,\\" although he sounds recorded separately from Santana, which he probably is - this is music by assembly line.

B0031RAOVY|5.0|This movie was extraordinary and extremely moving of the love and bond between this man and this dog. I don't want to say too much so I don't give anything away, but I've been talking about this movie ever since I watched it. And the fact that it's a true story and that a monument was erected in Japan of this wonderful Akita, Hachi!  LOVED IT! even though I cried like a baby it was a moving and profound story of loyalty and love. Richard Gere: a perfect choice ... Sad it didn't get much theatre time.  A must-see for dog lovers and everyone else. I purchased this movie as a must-have and highly recommend it to all.

B003V5PPZG|5.0|\\"A Thousand Suns\\" isn't an album for everyone.  If you're looking for the angsty, guitar heavy tracks of Hybrid Theory and Meteora you will be disappointed.  Now don't take this album as LP dissing all their old fans, because that's not what this is.  This is, actually, the band pushing themselves to do things that are difficult, to try things that challenge them to become better musicians.  They could have very easily have made another Hybrid Theory in a quarter of the time it took them to create this album and got loads of record sales, but that wasn't what they were looking for.  You have to commend them for pushing themselves creatively rather than rehashing the same sound over and over (i.e. Nickleback). That being said, this album is a masterpiece!  Never has a band made such unique, different sounds and made them work so well together!  The tracks flow from one to the next with such precision, that although no two tracks sound the same, none of them sound out of place.  This is an album in the truest sense of the word, as it really does make a difference hearing the songs in order as opposed to skipping tracks.  Contrary to popular belief, there is guitar on this album, lots of it actually, the guitars just don't take center stage as they did in previous albums, and sometimes they have effects on them that make it a little harder to make them out, but I assure you they are there.  Some the standout tracks on the album include Waiting for the End, which sees Mike Shinoda doing a reggae-style rap with  Chester Bennington singing beautifully about moving on. Another track, \\"When They Come for Me\\" sees Shinoda dropping some rhymes over an almost African-tribal beat. Give this album a shot with an open mind and I'm sure you will not be disappointed!

0066620996|5.0|This is a must read for any MBA student. The detailed analysis and approach to the problem in it's own is reason to read this book. The findings are interesting but not really stunning, it really doesn't take a genious to understand what makes certain companies stand out.  Furthermore, the fact that some of the companies have taken such a downward spiral to bancruptcy makes it hard to see that good to geat is anything more than a temporary setting. Of course Collins makes an excellent point to talk about this in the audio book and because he reads it himself, I advise listening to the audio book over reading the hardback.  His stress on certain words and interludes give the audio book listener a different perspective of that of the reader.
B001IYCMNA|1.0|From the beginning, we had difficulties with this WAP4410N access point for our small office.  We wanted to have a strong wireless signal and replaced a Linksys wireless router.     The product literature says that system set up is just \\"plug and play\\".  Wrong.  You have to have experience in setting up this type of device.  As with most technology, you have to use the help screen and downloaded manual to figure it all out.  We threw in the towel and just called in our network consultant who had it configured in an hour.     After all this, the access point just started randomly dropping the wireless signal. No one could access a signal.  To correct this random signal loss, we had to manually reboot the access point 2 X per week.  Very frustrating to have signal loss several times per week.    To try to correct this issue, I was able to download the latest firmare. That helped for about 3 weeks.  Now this week, same thing is starting...signal just drops.  We are back in re-start mode 3 X per week now!    I checked the logs and uptime and found no indication of any reported problem. I guess I can call back in my network tech and pay him a couple of hundred dollars to figure it all out.  Then I would be close to $600 invested in getting this up and going.    Finding online help from Cisco is out of the question.  There is a complicated registration process where they want to gather a lot of company/personal information before letting you access support. It is a real pain.    If you have a dedicated network tech on staff, then this might be the product for you.  If not, I would find another product.

Tip off should have been Chris Daughtery being included as a guest artist.  The whole CD is a mess and an embarrassement.  I have erased it from my media center and will sell it for whatever I can get...not really worth .02 however.  Perhaps its time that Carlos retired?

I emailed him to thank him for his gift of Linchpin and he took the time to send a short message back.

But Freedom is a novel, in the same way that The Great Gatsby is a novel.  It is a piece of literature, written word and story telling as art.  You should read this book because:    1. It is beautifully written  2. The story is fun, familiar, interesting, compelling, illuminating, and most of all moving.    That should be enough.

B0038VPB5W|4.0|Maybe I'm missing the point of some of these reviews a little but I can't believe the number of people flirting with the idea that BFMV sold out on this album. I couldn't disagree more. They have stuck to their roots with a slightly updated(and yes more mainstream) sound. Whats missing? The guitar is incredible, the drums are fast as ever, and vocals/lyrics are right on point. You want to see a band that doesn't know how to stick with their roots check out the new Linkin Park cd. To each their own but if you like the other BFMV albums this one is a winner in my mind.
B00127RAJY|3.0|There is way too much introduction that can't be skipped or fast forwarded through.  I can see why you would need to listen to it the first time, but why every single time?

B003XQRZ7E|5.0|\\"I am a messenger, this is my prophecy...\\" A bold statement of intent if ever there was one, and a lyric from the opening track on the new self-titled album by supergroup Black Country Communion.  The album, Black Country Communion, due out September 20th in the UK and September 21st in the US, is definitely bold--in fact, it's the strongest new album release I've heard in two years.  But when your band consists of the legendary Glenn Hughes (bass & vocals), blues/rock prodigy Joe Bonamassa (guitar and vocals), Led Zeppelin legacy Jason Bonham (drums), and Dream Theater, Kiss, and Alice Cooper alumni Derek Sherinian (keyboards), a strong, bold new album is almost certainly assured.      Produced by none other than Kevin \\"Caveman\\" Shirley (Iron Maiden, Led Zeppelin, and Black Crowes among others), the album sounds as it should... a raw, live-in-the-studio sound that hasn't been heard since the mid-seventies.  And while this album certainly harkens back to those wonderful classic days of yore, make no mistake, Black Country Communion is a breath of fresh air!  It's not overly-polished, it allows room for light and dark, and it's not afraid to let its musicians stretch out and jam, and in today's world of over-produced, bland, soulless fare, this album pulls way ahead of the pack.    Performances are tight but loose, often driving and forceful, powered along by Bonham's steam hammer drumming and Hughes' heavy yet fluid bass lines.  Bonamassa, as in his solo material, continues to amaze, pulling out massive riffs, soulful blues licks, and incredible guitar solos that will blister the paint on the walls.  Sherinian works his magic in a somewhat understated way, providing textures and moods, but occasionally taking the spotlight while Hughes' world-renowned vocals soar above it all.  The band is tight and fit together just as smoothly as whiskey and soda, sounding as if they've been playing together for years, and although the performances are tight, the songs sound looseand comfortable, as if they were done live in the studio in one or two takes.      Black Country Communion starts off strong with the title track, forceful rock and roll with a locomotive bass line, loose and dirty blues licks, and blazing guitar solos, and never lets up from there.  \\"One Last Soul\\" is the first single from the album, already the most requested song on the UK's premier Classic Rock radio station, Planet Rock, and is catchy enough to have you tapping your foot and digging the funky, soulful chorus.  By way of contrast, \\"Down Again\\" is a heavy, riff-based rhythm machine powered by Joe Bonamassa's grinding guitar and the 16-ton weight of the Bonham and Hughes rhythm machine working to nail the song to the floor.  Derek Sherinian shines on this one, employing organ-based keys to provide a hypnotic outro that absolutely mesmerizes.  \\"Beggarman\\" is another straight rocker, a hard blues guitar intro leading into a riff as the organ and bass join in to drive the song.  Jason Bonham shines here, beating and kicking the drums like an animal.    But while the band certainly rocks hard, they are equally adept at playing with light and shade.  \\"Sista Jane\\" starts with a kick-in-the-head opening, but changes to a light, quiet verse with acoustic guitar, which then builds in intensity into a chorus that will have you banging your head old-school style!  \\"No Time\\" boogies right along as if there really is no time before it breaks into a moody \\"Kashmir-esque,\\" eastern-flavored keyboard melody, allowing for a change of mood and pace before building once again into its kick-ass chorus.  The band's cover of the Trapeze classic, \\"Medusa,\\" gives the band some breathing room as well, opening as it does with slow acoustic guitar and restrained vocals before they crank it up to 11 and the song becomes heavier than the stone into which Medusa's gaze can render you.  Bonamassa rips into the rhythm with obvious relish, a strong monster groove that is held down by a massive bass and drum combo while Glenn's vocals soar like an eagle over this majestic track.  The raw, blistering guitar solo affirms Joe Bonamassa's reputation as a living-legend guitar god, his guitar tearing away with whirlwind speed, echoing like a lonely cry in the wilderness.  This song not only affirms the band's Black Country roots, but it sounds right at home on this album.    Two songs especially give the band room to move around and jam a bit; the eight minute, thirty-three second \\"Song of Yesterday,\\" and the eleven minute, nineteen second \\"Too Late for the Sun.\\"  There aren't many bands these days confident enough to put long-running tracks on an album that allow the musicians to stretch out a bit, improvise, and jam, but Black Country Communion gives us two long-runners and they prove to be worth the risk.  \\"Too Late for the Sun\\" is a remarkable piece, Sherinian's organ providing a nice sonic texture, and the band jamming along like so many bands are afraid to do these days.     Black Country Communion showcases the talents of four amazing artists, and the combination of these four talents makes for one hell of a great album!  Glenn Hughes rolls out huge, thumping bass lines and turns in a vocal performance that proves why the man is a rock legend.  Joe Bonamassa, young though he may be, plays guitar with the passion of an old soul and shines like few other guitarists on the scene today.  Jason Bonham is an absolute drum powerhouse, playing with a ferocity that blazes, and along with Glenn's bass, is the unstoppable engine for this band.  Derek Sherinian is artful in the textures and moods he creates--he shows tasteful restraint, but steps forward when needed.  Delivering twelve solid tracks of bold, old-school rock and roll, Black Country Communion stands out as a masterpiece and an instant classic!    Brent Soileau  Deep Purple Hub
B003MZ0I84|5.0|There is something to be said of a group that doesn't get comfortable in the popularity of their own bright star. If you picked up this album, thinking \\"I hope I get to hear `This Love' or `Make Me Wonder' again,\\" then you will be sorely disappointed. But, fortunately, that's where the disappointment ends. Adam's smooth, soulful voice and good looks definitely croon to the younger fans they undeniable have. However, on this album, Adam leaves that persona behind; and, for the first time since \\"Harder To Breath\\" becomes to the lead singer of a rock band.<br /><br />Now for the album. The sound is a great mix of \\"Songs About Jane\\" and \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long.\\" I think they were trying for that in their sophomore album, but all we heard was pop/rock. Here, they play with the softer side of rock that falls right on the cusp of adult contemporary pop and emo pop. To their credit, Mutt Lange really pushes the Adam's vocals. His voice oozes with emotion and you can see that he's more than an overtly sexual lead singer; he's a 30-something man who has been through love, life, failure, and triumph. The musical arrangements--expertly played by Matt (drums), Mickey (Bass), James (guitar) and Jesse (keyboards)--further showcase the drive Lange pushed in the group. You can almost hear the whole album being played in a House of Blues setting. Similarly, the overall production of the album complements the new sounds; nothing is too upbeat, nothing is overproduced, and all the songs run from track to track with effortless transition. Lyrically, the woes of love, highs of ecstasy, lows of tumultuous affairs, and climaxes of unhealthy trysts still permeate. But, with this new sound the lyrics transcend that whiny adolescent theme and become more about adults who have lived and learned, and have come out better for it. I have to even commend the group for the one collaboration they threw in the mix. It's easy country/pop combination doesn't take away from the entire feel of the album, but rather adds to the risk and depth the group wanted to produce.<br /><br />I've stated in previous reviews of the band's albums that they are the essence of a grown up boyband. And, I've never meant that as an insult. But, this album is a real testament that a band can grow up without leaving their fans behind. Its also a great example of watching a band transition over albums.<br /><br />Listen to: \\"Misery\\", \\"Hands All Over\\" \\"Don't Know Nothing,\\" and \\"Never Gonna Leave This Bed\\"ut rather adds to the risk and depth the group wanted to produce.

B003DKJ5ZU|4.0|TINKER BELL AND THE GREAT FAIRY RESCUE is the third TINKER BELL movie, following TINKER BELL and TINKER BELL AND THE LOST TREASURE. This adventure has Tink visiting the mainland for her first \\"summer camp\\", the time of the year that the fairies visit our world and prepare nature for summer. Tink has been warned to stay away from the human house because it will mean nothing but trouble. However, when she sees a car drive by her mechanical curiosity kicks in and she has to know how it works. Vidia follows her and tries to get her to come back to the safety of the oak tree, but her curiosity gets the better of Tink and when Vidia pulls a prank on her to teach her a lesson, Tink ends up captured by a young girl named Lizzy.<br /><br />Lizzy is fascinated by fairies. She is staying at the cottage with her father, Dr. Griffiths, a scientist with a particular interest in lepidoptery (study of butterflies and moths). Her dad loves Lizzy, but he can't seem to find the balance between his work and spending time with his daughter. Lizzy and Tinker bell soon become friends and Tink goes about trying to help Lizzy's relationship with her dad. Meanwhile, Vidia returns to the summer camp and explains to everyone about Tink's capture. Amidst a terrible rainstorm, Tink's friends set out to rescue her from the human house.<br /><br />I was a bit surprised by TINKERBELL AND THE GREAT FAIRY RESCUE. From the trailers I had seen, I had assumed there was going to be a bit more danger and excitement. Basically, Tink gets captured but is in no real danger because Lizzy loves fairies and is in desperate need of a friend. I had assumed the story was going to be more focused on Tinker bell's friends as the journeyed to the house to rescue her. However, their journey wasn't very dangerous and the other fairies were more or less background fodder for a story focusing on Tink. I did enjoy how the story humanized Vidia. She is the complete opposite of Tink, but is growing to like her, despite their differences, yet she still wants Tink to be more mature than she acts. It was also nice having the story take place away from Pixie Hollow because it allowed things to more naturally revolve around Tink and her friends. The movie is notable in that it shows the first time that a human flies using pixie dust and happy thoughts. I did feel the ending was a bit rushed and it would have been nice to see more character development of Lizzy and her father. Overall, though the story is predictable, it's still enjoyable and is just about the right length. It's sure to delight those already familiar with the Disney fairies and has a special appeal to younger girls.<br /><br />The DVD includes several extras including a slew of trailers, a sneak-peak at Disney's latest upcoming animated feature film TANGLED, several deleted scenes, a music video with Bridgit Mendler (star of GOOD LUCK CHARLIE), a look at the design a fairy house contest Disney sponsored, and the game the Fairy Field Guide Builder which upon completion gives a sneak peak at a Winter Fairy. Of the trailers, TANGLED especially stood out as well as the very short teaser trailer for TINKER BELL AND THE MYSTERIOUS WOODS. The special feature that I enjoyed the most was the sneak-peak at TANGLED and the deleted scenes. I think the filmmakers should have kept the original beginning of the story in the movie. It goes a long way to explaining why Lizzy's dad is the way he is. I realize they wanted the scene where Lizzy and Tink to meet to be special, but I don't think the original beginning would have taken anything away from that. It also helps make Dr. Griffith's transformation at the end of the movie easier to understand and believe.r differences, yet she still wants Tink to be more mature than she acts.

I realize they wanted the scene where Lizzy and Tink to meet to be special, but I don't think the original beginning would have taken anything away from that. It also helps make Dr. Griffith's transformation at the end of the movie easier to understand and believe.
B003PIUBZS|4.0|Original interpretation are the first words I would use to describe this production to anyone who hasnt seen this and to me thats what makes this series an excellent production. Im hardly a seasoned reviewer and many people have already made decent and accurate reviews but I would like to press on one point that one reviewer has a problem with and thats the CG part of the movie.     I myself am a Special FX artist and it is quite obvious that photo realism was not the aim of this movie but rather a creative direction in effects and lighting. I loved the sereal lighting and 'fake' juxtaposition of backgrounds which gave me a sense of timelessness rather than a sense of disbelieve. The slow motion blood effects were very convincing however and at times to my own astonishment, I found myself up in my chair turning my hand over to lower my thumb just so I could see more blood and heads rolling!    True many of the arena shots from above were clearly lacking detail and CG looking but I believe this was intentional to keep with the creativity of the direction. There were other times when CG was used very well like the crowds cheering at the arena, all this would have been done using software like Massive which appears in many movies more specifically LOTR battle scenes.    So you see, I find it hard to believe that the lack of realism was because the lack of expertise, perhaps lack of funding and time had a small influence but to me this was embraced by the directors and it came off well IMO. Dont come to this production looking for an epic LOTR trilogy with a billion dollar budget, instead approach it with an open mind, expect to be enlightened, shocked, aroused and most importantly entertained.    I thought John Hannah was fantastic and the rest of the actors very convincing.

B003DKJ5ZU|5.0|if you're a Disney and Peter Pan  fan and you ever had any doubts about whether making Tinker Bell the central character of a Disney film series would work, they should all disappear when you see Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue. I really believe this would be a very successful film if released theatrically, especially this time of year when pickings are lean at the theaters.<br /><br />The first film, titled Tinker Bell, was largely an origin story, and the second, Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure, helped develop the supporting characters (especially Terrence) and Tinker Bell's anger issues. This film offers a good balance between our lead fairy and her friends along with a really solid story that never seems padded, a hazard in some direct-to-video films.<br /><br />Like a Victorian E.T., this new film gives us a chance to see what happens when a young, imaginative child gets the dream of a lifetime -- to meet a fairy. Woven beautifully into the narrative are the young girl's need for her father's attention (who is present for her in body only), the dynamics between the fairy characters (focusing mostly on Vidia, who is nicer in this film but still having the prickly attitude of Veronica Lodge) and the wonderful activity of creating fairy houses (which is showcased in a bonus feature taking place at the Epcot Flower & Garden Festival).<br /><br />The film has a nice, lyrical pace but never lags for a moment, much in the style now identified with Pixar movies (some character designs even have a Pixar look). What are most delightful for fans are the references to the 1953 Disney classic. In the opening moments, Terence brings Tinker Bell to Fairy Camp and says, \\"There it is, Tinker Bell -- Fairy Camp!\\" much as Peter Pan said, \\"There it is Wendy -- second star to the right and straight on 'til morning!\\" At one point, there is a glimpse of the Darling home from the sky, as well as the iconic Big Ben landing.<br /><br />This is the least musical of the Disney Fairies films, but the score by Joel McNeely is magnificent -- yet there does not seem to be a soundtrack album! Maybe it will show up as a download.<br /><br />Visually, Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue is a feast and a good excuse to finally get that Blu-Ray player. With a big screen TV you can simulate the look of the film in a movie theater.el McNeely is magnificent -- yet there does not seem to be a soundtrack album! Maybe it will show up as a download.

030726999X|4.0|My main problem with the final book of the Millenium Trilogy is that it's too good: very little conflict happens and you're left with a forgone conclusion until the epilogue. The Section (*dun dun DUNNNNN*) starts the book looking like an even more menancing antagonist than Zalachenko, but after Gullberg's plan is completed, they do very little throughout the rest of the book. They seem totally baffled by Blomkvist's actions and people who are supposedly trained professionals in the art of surveillance fail to notice anything suspicious for months as Blomkvist and Edklinth begin to piece together the whole story. The Section's (*dun dun DUNNNNN*) last action (the scene with the Serbians) is over and done in twenty pages and really did not create a lot of tension. In the previous two books, the antagonists are moving and acting against those attempting to unravel the mystery, but now their actions aren't even mentioned.<br /><br />It's a wild read, and I really enjoyed it, but I realize now that the climax of the trilogy was at the end of The Girl Who Played With Fire. Here, a major antagonist disappears for almost the entire book, and another character mentioned a lot never appears (but I guess she has a lot of money in the bank). Plague and Trinity are never seen after their short scenes of usefulness. A previous love interest of Blomkvist is totally gone. Figuerola is missing after the trial. What happened to these people? The prose closely resembles the Wennerstr&ouml;m antics in the epilogue of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo: fun but lacking in substance.<br /><br />The Berger subplot holds my interest well, but I was amazed that Larsson decided that it was one step forward, two steps back by the end. Wasn't she supposed to grow a little? I also had no idea why she just didn't call the board and get the guy fired? It also didn't seem to connect with the main storyline at all. Something really should have happened because of what Linda learned about Salander or maybe the characters of Berger's bodyguard and Figuerola should have been combined. No consequences ever surface because of Blomkvist and Berger's trist. What's the point of this section?<br /><br />The relationship with Figuerola seemed really forced. Haven't you described, at length, about how busy he is? And he's got time, with a deadline looming and a life on the line, for this?<br /><br />The trial was oddly unsatisfying. I knew the key pieces of evidence Giannini was going to use, and she presents them at just the right time, but the dialogue between her and Teleborian seemed at best unfocused, at worst incoherent. She doesn't frame her points well, and tries to go in several directions at once, rather than pressing a single issue to expose the lies. This scene clearly emphasizes that courtroom drama is not Larsson's strength, and the last monologue seemed so semantic and cliche that I couldn't follow her reasoning.<br /><br />I have to give this four stars, because I was flying through it and Blomkvist's plotting is smart and glib. I really shouldn't, though. My reviews of the first two books centered on the lack of effort to make Blomkvist a real character, but apparently Larsson got bored with even attempting to do so, and makes this more of a crime novel, following procedures over a -huge- cast of characters. He does it well, but it really isn't that superlative.of Berger's bodyguard and Figuerola should have been combined. No consequences ever surface because of Blomkvist and Berger's trist.

B003TML0VO|1.0|Carlos recently gave a great interview in Guitar Player and talked about playing guitar from the soul - in a spiritual sort of way - if you will...  I have to wonder now... after hearing this total sell out of a CD from him.  While My Guitar Gently Weeps is a decent interpretation, but the rest of the CD is a waste of money.  It really is rather embarrassing for Santana to release this.  I am shocked at how low Carlos is willing to stoop in effort to make a few more bucks. Did he not make enough money on his recent over priced, extended stay in Las Vegas at the Hard Rock???  Wow, the \\"legendary\\" Daughtry... singing a Def Leppard song???  No thanks... When was Stevie Wonder's Superstition considered a classic Guitar song???  No, this is NOT guitar playing from the soul...  Buy some good music - purchase the original versions of Whole lotta love, SOTW, and Sunshine - instead of this junk.
B003JTHETY|5.0|Where can I even start, This album is just beyond amazing. What makes this even more amazing is that Maiden can still pull this off after 35 years. Bruce's vocals somehow sound even better than they did on AMOLAD and the music is as powerful as ever.    1. Satellite 15.....The Final Frontier 8.5/10: When I first heard the second half of this song a few months before the album's release, I just thought it was a catchy, fast-paced rocker. WRONG! The beginning of this song is truly bizarre, from the odd synth intro to the creepy space guitar noises to Bruce's reverb filled vocals, it just erases any thoughts about this being just another Maiden album.    2. El Dorado 7/10: Not a bad song! Musicianship is good but the vocals are kind of boring and nonchalant in a sense, it's great to say that this is the probably the worst song on the album.    3. Mother of Mercy 9/10: This is where things get exciting in The Final Frontier! Immediately this song just draws an astounding mental picture of a soldier on the battlefield. Don't pinch yourself if you think back to such songs as \\"Paschendale\\" and \\"The Longest Day\\", though personally I think this song blows them away!    4. Coming Home 10/10: That's right, it's power ballad time for Maiden! If you know anything of Bruce's solo material, you will know this is all him. A decent amount of bands these days would come off as a bit corny for making a song like this, but Maiden splits the line of heavy and soft which just makes for one fantastic track.    5. The Alchemist 7.5/10: Maiden goes back into their original form in a Janickified song. Quick paced beginning and a catchy riff lead the way into the legendary galloping verses which have propelled Maiden to the top of the metal world. My only gripe with this song is that they've done it before, which slightly cheapens what had been a very original album to this point.    6. Isle of Avalon 8.5/10: Kudos to you if you liked this song just as much the second time as you did the first time, this is the grower on the album! Super complex and very un-maidenlike (save Steve's signature bassline in the beginning). If you didn't like it the first time, give it a few more listens, it's too much to take in in one sitting.    7. Starblind 9/10: Another fairly odd song but a dutified chord striker. Slow and slightly ominous beginning (as are the remaining songs), immediately switches to a big, bad Adrian Smith guitar intro, think Lord Of Light. Bruce propels this song incredibly with his ageless voice, leading into a powerful chorus, headlining this fantastic song.    8. The Talisman 10/10: OH MAN THIS TRACK RULES! From beginning to end, this work of genius will keep any fan of good music's attention. It starts off with a gorgeous acoustic intro which is soon followed by the soothing soft Bruce vocals which paints the picture for the rest of the song. When the metal kicks in, hold on to your chair because you may feel yourself lurching with the moves of the ship at sea! Reminiscent of Ghost of The Navigator from Brave New World except, once again, it's better!    9. The Man Who Would Be King 9/10: This songs music completely overwhelms the vocals, in a good way! Dave Murray doesn't write vocals in his songs, but he sure makes up for it with his music compositions! This is most likely the most dense song on the album, with loads and loads of dual and tri harmony parts that may cause part of your brain to short circuit. Much like Isle of Avalon, give it a few listens before you give your final verdict.    10 When The Wild Wind Blows 11/10: BEST SONG OF THE LAST DECADE BY MAIDEN! If any of you have seen the film or read the novel \\"When The Wind Blows\\", then you will appreciate this track that much more. A tearful beginning with the near nursery rhyme soft riff, which leads into a nearly hopeless sounding Bruce, you could swear he was looking out a window and watching the bombs fall on England when he sang this. As expected, it doesn't stay like this forever but the heavy in this song is a different kind of heavy, like they turned the gain from 10 to about 8. It crossed wires with me the first time I heard it but this is how this album should end, with a good thinker! After the full development over this 11 minute opus, and after you hear the wind blow for the last time, you know you have heard metal's finest do it once again.    For anyone that is having second thoughts about buying this album, COME ON YOU IRON!    Up the irons! Long may the Maiden reign!

B003TML0VO|5.0|Santana's new album, Guitar Heaven, is like My Dinner with Andre in the best sense of what this might imply.  It's the musical equivalent of a heated conversation between two intellects of the highest order.  It fulfills many fantasies, one of being privy to a conversation between two great artists, like Leonardo da Vinci and Picasso.  It also captures the euphoric excitement of being at concert where Santana and his guest musicians are with you in the seats cheering.  Professional musicians with utmost respect in awe of the guitar songs and playing along with them.     Another fantasy it delivers is the artistic equivalent of having a private tour in a world class museum like the MoMA by a leading art historian explaining it all to you.  What Carlos and his musicians pull out and recognize from the guitar classics is a lesson in and of itself, in interpretation.  It's like the single large blue square by Yves Klein is being explained to us by a professional aesthete.    Guitar Heaven is like x-ray vision in that it allows us inside Carlos's and his esteemed musician guest's minds.  What does he hear when he listens to Fortunate Son that many of us might not (pick up on)?  We find out.  What bends, what \\"takes\\" does Carlos and his musicians get out of some of the greatest guitar classics of all time?  We're now backstage.  We now know and get to enjoy Carlos and the musician's enjoyment and ecstasy for these tunes.    At the same time, it's almost irrelevant that it's all covers because what Carlos and his musicians create from each song becomes a whole new vibe, a whole new creation of the song.    Carlos sweetly supports the guest vocalists, going where they go, yet giving strongly of his own.    Gavin Rossdale's breathy voice on Bang a Gong, and what he does to the end of \\"and you're my girl\\" going up a few octaves and then down, creates a whole new sound with grit and all of his background and experience of being a rockin roller can be heard through his voice which comes from a deep, learned place.  As Clive said in the special DVD interview accompanying the CD, it was crucial, and he made this point known, that Carlos take-off and go as long as he needed, and that the guest singers go wherever they wanted and needed to go, musically speaking.  And we get to hear that.  It's like being with two staunch individuals who respect one another intensely.  Carlos and the tunes in a vacuum of rock sophistication.    The juxtaposition of Carlos, Indie.Arie and Yo Yo Ma in While my Guitar Gently Weeps, literally makes you weep from the amount of musical punch in one song.  Not to mention getting from it their incredible respect for and understanding of George Harrison's meaning.    Joe Cocker's understanding of Little Wing, not only the riffs but the lyrics is obvious, strongly felt.  Somehow, this particular pairing, Joe Cocker's passion and kind soul singing through Hendrix's \\"voice,\\" is, blow away.  And Carlos gives back as earnestly as Cocker.    Clive's idea for the album was a brilliant one.  It gives the listener a fantasy.  It is, guitar heaven.

B003PIUC02|5.0|Spartacus: Blood and Sand...   CGI Effects: I had first watched the series each week on Stars and once again with my wife on Bluray. The people behind the scenes had a vision of what kind of story would compel viewers to follow the series and spread the word to friends and family. While some can say the CGI \\"blood\\" was over the top, ala \\"300\\", it can be viewed that this was mostly for stylization and give the viewer a sense of how brutal a gladiators life was. I prefer the comic book style in a way over simulated blood - it is less messy and therfor less \\"gory\\" while still managing to give the viewer the sense of brutality without turning their stomachs.     Acting: When you view a movie or series and find a hard time imagining someone better for a role, they have done their jobs for picking the actors and actresses. This is the case here. If you found the same occurrence in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" movies (like me), then you may fall in line with my way of thinking for this series. I am generalizing the association between the two only in this case. The acting is believable and consistent. There is nobody that stands out in my opinion as taking away from the series for bad acting. The relatively unknown, Andy Whitfield, shines like a beacon in the night in regards to his acting prowess in the movie. There are highs and many lows in his character and he does a fine job of portraying all of it.     Plots/storyline: This is a series where plot twists shine. Many other series try for the same goals, but fail miserably more often than not. My wife is very, very good at figuring out movies and series plots well before they release the results. More often than not, she was left guessing, which is no small feat. I found this most refreshing and entertaining.     Historical: While I am historical buff (especially this era and area of the world) and very anal when viewing movies and series representing the past, I could not help but forgive some obvious flaws. The main reasonbeing, this part of history that was primarily erased and little known because of obvious reasons - this part of Roman history was an embarrassment and mostly eradicated. With this said, this is a perfect reason to have a series of this nature because the writers can \\"fill in the blanks\\" with entertaining plots and sub plots and still retain written history as a whole. It is a series that tries to entertain first, be historically accurate second. I would also like to point out the attire and appearance of the cast throughout the series. From my point of view, it is nearly spot on for what they could represent. Dirt. Grime. At times, sweaty and bloody. For whatever reason, I cannot stand movies and series that base their primaries around certain eras but their costume and makeup departments go ultra-overboard and make everything look spotless and perfect. The realism factor is almost always immediately lost when I encounter this. This series delivers especially well in the environment and grit/grime factors.     Series goals: The series needs to be watched in it's entirety. Some other person making a review here gave it 3 stars and based it on just 4 episodes. This review is incomplete and fairly unjust - anyone watching the whole series knows that the character development and plot twists escalate as the series continues all the way to the end. This is entertainment and I feel it delivers in most areas superbly.      Gratuitous scenes: There are many naked scenes. Heck, even Xena gets down and dirty on more than one occasion. I don't mind this sort of \\"behavior\\" from the film makers if it is done right and fits the storyline and plots. Surprisingly, they give the women/gay audience more than one scene to hit the rewind button a few times. Men that enjoy the female form will get more than enough - if it fits the bill. The violence? It's gladiators. If you don't like violence and nudity, you will definitely want to pass on this one.     There are only some \\"off\\" issues that I have (slight in it's importance) that I will not go into any particulars on (in case you have yet to watch the series). One such case is the long, drawn out sickly love cycle of one of the main gladiators and a servant. It seems like it just goes on and on. I kept thinking \\"please someone get caught and die already\\". They laid it on pretty thick on a few episodes to the point that I thought the gladiator was going to bust out and start singing love songs. My wife thought the same way, but perhaps there are others (particularly women) that would get allot out of the \\"interludes\\". Another was the man/boy love (boy, being the character is portrayed as quite a bit younger in age and wisdom than the man). It may be this was another audience grab - the gay population. I remember when watching it, I read through different sites of how much the gay population really loved the series. At first I thought it was because of all the muscled characters ala \\"300\\", but then as the story progressed I found the obvious structure of a gay relationship. While personally, I felt disjointed from this particular offshoot storyline (because I do not relate to it), it did not dissuade me from watching it as a whole. Also, in tune with the age, it was not uncommon to have gay relationships - so, while put off personally a bit, I found looking at it historically put me in balance. In story lines, some people prefer vanilla over strawberry flavors. I am amiss with the decisions to have this at play - was it a blatant attempt to reel in a particular segment? Were they just trying to be a bit more accurate with the time period? Not sure, but in the end, it doesn't matter. The soupy love interest (previously mentioned) and the gay relationship is intertwined within the whole storyline, so there is nothing that feels out of place. If this garners more of an audience while still keeping others in it's hold, then kudos to the writers for doing so.     All in all, my wife and I found the series quite entertaining. The Twisting plots, great storyline, good character development, top notch acting, attention to detail, and realistic costumes were all very good and when all added up, it drew the viewer in wanting more. No series is perfect (except maybe Band of Brothers), but this is by far better than most of the garbage the executives think we should be watching.     Of note: Andy Whitfield had initially found he had cancer. Underwent treatment and was cleared to work. Very recently however, he had again found the cancer has come back. He WILL NOT be able to do the next season anytime soon (if at all). I do not know if Stars will continue on without him, but my my perspective I feel like they should wait until (or if) he gets better. He has done an outstanding job and cannot be replaced regardless of how much of a cash cow this series may be. I for one would not watch the series, unless Hollywood found a way of cloning Whitfield. Good luck and god bless Andy, we who have had the pleasure of viewing your work wish you all the best to a speedy recovery.
B0000640VO|5.0|As far as foreign films go, I don't have a lot of viewing hours devoted; most of my viewing pleasure has been with American Hollywood.  Amelie may change that for me!<br /><br />After Run Lola Run, a German film with non-stop action and tons of allegory, I wanted a film that would fit the same bill and Amelie was clearly that:  fun acting, interesting allegory, some very strange scenes and several themes.<br /><br />The film throws a few curves, gives information that has nothing to do with the film's plot but apparently was thrown in for fun.  The fact that a bluebottle fly buzzes by a table where, unnoticed, two glasses of wine are dancing on a table cloth is interesting curiosa but the narrator makes it sound so important.<br /><br />Grown up with a worrisome, unaffectionate father and a very strange mother, (who oddly gets killed by someone jumping off a church tower! - Happens every day, right?) Amelie is a shy person who does not know how to deal with people in general.  But she's very clever.<br /><br />After finding a hidden box of boy's stuff, filled with jacks, photos and all, she manages to find the person whose box it belonged to from some 40 years before.  After much adventure, she manages to find him and creates creative ways to get it to him without knowledge of benefactor.<br /><br />She succeeds!  After this, it's her goal to make life happier for others.  With the help of a recluse painter, she comes to realize that her life would be better if, rather than being a do-gooder, that she really should help herself too.<br /><br />The film is quite imaginative.  She fails at meeting the person she loves, turns to water and SPLASH!  She does not really become water of course - it was metaphor.  These kinds of scenes are peppered throughout the film.<br /><br />Amelie is billed as a romantic comedy.  It's comedic for sure, but it is more a story of her confrontation with life, her realization that she's creating her own barriers to happiness and the adventure of overcoming these.  The wild actions she engages in to avoid contact with her crush are just hilarious.<br /><br />Audrey Tautou is perfect as the shy girl with big eyes and clever lines.<br /><br />Highly recommended, although the film is a bit too long and has enough sex and nudity to keep it in the R rated category.e engages in to avoid contact with her crush are just hilarious.

The range is excellent and the volume/chat controls are perfectly tuned for on the go playing. Even the Bass settings can be changed at the touch of a finger in case the explosions are rumbling your brain.    As soon as I put these on, I felt like I was cheating in MW2. I could hear footsteps coming up from behind me that I never heard before, planes sounded awesome as they passed overhead and I could actually hear the bolt \\"clink\\" every time the rifle I was firing recoiled. If you're still playing with that crappy Xbox stock mic, then this will turn your eyes back.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|I got this pack for my wife for her birthday, and let me tell you: I was impressed. The video quality was amazing (it is blu-ray after all!) as well as the audio. I have to admit when I first opened the package, I was a little nervous because I found out the movies were made in the UK, not the United States (different box art and rating system). The only other difference about these movies and their U.S. counterparts is when you load the blu-rays, you have to select a language before you view them. Aside from that, they play perfectly fine on my player, which is region 1 (U.S.). If you love the Bourne Series, owning this collection is a no-brainer.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|The \\"Alien Quadrilogy\\" box set caught my eye when I first heard about it online at the website but, at the time, the price was too expensive. I decided to wait a while until the price went lower but then, I forgot all about it. Years later, I saw it here at Amazon (at a good, decent price no less) and as soon as I got it, I now know why people called it one of the best box sets of the 00s. All 4 films are presented with pristine quality and with two ways to watch it: watch the original theatrical cut or the special extended version with a indication (a \\"SPECIAL EDITION\\" signal) that let you know when you came to a scene omitted from the theatrical version of the movie. I saw all 4 films in 3 days and the special features were very extensive and detailed every behind the scenes problem (and from watching the documentaries for the movies, there were many problems) not to mention the bonus 9th disc that has some great archival features ranging from trailers & TV spots to a UK TV retrospective focusing on the worldwide impact of the first movie. One wish, however, is that the archival disc should've had the documentary \\"The Alien Legacy\\", the direct-to-video special \\"The Making of Alien 3\\" & the \\"Alien: Resurrection\\" episode of \\"HBO First Look\\". But other than those omissions, the box set exceeded all my expectations. Definitely worth watching over and over again, whether you're a fan of one or two movies in the series or a fan of all four.

0399156704|5.0|This was my kind of book with a great combination of suspense, romance and dog training (which I find very interesting).  Good mix of characters and intrigue.

B001MEJY8W|5.0|Tortured at an early age, Lucie Jurin is on a mission to take revenge on those who abused her. However, she's also insane, and her friends fear for what may happen to her. Followed by her loyal childhood friend, Anna, who is there to see that she comes to no harm, they come upon a house owned by a seemingly ordinary family. But it brings them close to the truth, and then the truth explodes on the screen, more horrible and vast than either of them ever imagined. Anna will go from protector to victim to something more than human...if I tell any more it will give away this amazing if horrifying tale.<br /><br />Martyrs is an excellent psychological thriller as well as a horror film, a film that leaves you asking deep questions about the nature of evil and the transcendence of evil. The strength of the human spirit is celebrated and the arrogance and disregard of evil condemned. A philosophical success as well as a terrifying one. This must see for anyone who is an experienced horror devotee, but be warned. It is also one of the most disturbing horror films ever made, and some may find it too psychologically distressing to bear.
031250926X|5.0|This version of Eric Carle's book is one of my favorites. The slide and find format is perfect for this book. The construction is high quality and very sturdy.<br /><br />Hopefully we will see more slide and find versions of Carle's other great books.

B003V5PPZG|1.0|Hybrid Theory and Meteora were the best two albums I've ever heard. This is utter garbage. A new genre has been created here, electro pap. Gutted.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Seedy London, addicted Sherlock and Dr. Watson as an action hero. Differently done, yet some how true to the nature of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's master detecive character. Never a dull moment!
B00005LK94|5.0|Wonderful movie, excellent condition, my young grandson enjoyed it very much as he's taken with horses at the age of 3, a very mature 3 years old. Thank you for making it possible to purchase this DVD at such a reasonable price.
