B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game so much! its fun and creative! all we need now is the Girl on Fire app and the Instagram app and we'll all be happy.
B0086700CM|5.0|I cant believe it finally came to kindled fire!! I love it! best app ever!! xxxxxxxxxdddddddddd :::::::::))))))))))))) tots awesome *********###$$$$$$$$$$$ challenging but awseome
B007LB5MF4|3.0|Well, it was frustrating to find out, only after the purchase, that I would not be able to read my new book on my iPad... I suggest a big red capital-lettered warning: NOT FOR IPAD... Or will it be available for ipad in the near future? If not, money badly spent...
B0055V0GQC|5.0|I can't begin to describe how friggin' brilliant this album and band is.  I am going to go there and some may scoff, but two albums in and this band is better than Led Zeppelin.<br /><br />I know some of you have just lost your lunch at that comment, but if this album does not exude its greatness on the first listen i'd be shocked.  it is then cemented in the annals of rock and roll history by the third.  Now let me preface I am comparing their two albums with the first two albums of LZ.  Now I am not some 18yr old kid that has not even heard the LZ catalogue, because i have times over.  I am huge fan of LZ and they built the hard rock empire, but Rival Sons have perfected it.<br /><br />This album top to bottom has no duds.....hell the only thing that disappoints is the album cover.<br /><br />Best tracks are P&T, White Noise, Face of Light and Save Me.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been just waiting around for this game to come out to kindle and now its finally here!!!! I couldn't be happier with it. I have been playing it non stop for the past two days!! I would defenetly recommend this to anyone and everyone. =3)
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is fantastic. How do I know? Well, I keep on playing it despite the fact that it randomly makes my phone crash about every 30 minutes of play or so. Normally that would be too obnoxious to bear, but this game is so much fun I just wait for my phone ot reboot and go at it again. It can also be laggy. Gameplay is simple swiping and tilting, conceptually it's very easy to play, even my 3 and 4 year old kids understand how to play, BUT it is surprisingly challenging. Fun, fun, fun!! I would give it 5 stars if it would stop crashing!
0547258305|5.0|During college I had a default birthday/Christmas present, and that was a Barnes and Nobles or Amazon gift card. Graceling was a purchase from one of those gift cards. I read the synopsis on some review site and it captured my imagination. I needed to read it, so I did, multiple times.<br /><br />Graceling happens to be one of the books in my top ten favourites. I have read it so many times that it has become warped and I know have to wait a time between this last reading and the next one, because I have it memorized by heart which tends to not make good reading.<br /><br />Graceling happens to have one of the most interesting world building and characters that I have ever read. The character of Katsa, and the way relationships are approached in Cashore's books are revolutionary. It is obvious that Cashore is more forward thinking in her way of doing love stories as they are not so clean cut, and don't always end traditionally.<br /><br />Katsa as a character goes through so much growth, while still being so strong to begin with. She is a character that I look up to and would love for my children to read as a good example of representing a woman. She is living in a restrictive medieval society, yet is still shown to be strong.<br /><br />What I also enjoy is Po, the \\"love interest\\" so to say is a supporting role, rather then a manly take over and save the day role. In fact Katsa kicks his butt several times a day it seems (I adore their relationship).<br /><br />The pacing and prose matched the story and character well in my opinion and it made it very hard to put the book down, despite its length. And somehow, although the pacing is fast, the plot takes its time and explores around the situation. There is an overall goal to the plot, yet where we end up is not where we expect and everything ends up being so much more dire than originally thought.<br /><br />--<br /><br />All fantasy readers, read this book, it is an excellent piece of literature, there is a reason it has been so well received as a book. It features a strong female character filled with a lot of depth and many other characters with their own personalities, issues and secrets.it has been so well received as a book.

B0086700CM|5.0|it is a pretty sweet game...lots of fun and addicting which isn't always good haha but I like it (extra words to reach 20)
B002FWW996|5.0|Live Free or Die Hard is another one of Bruce Willis's films that is awesone.  It is exciting from beginning to end.  I now own all the Die Hard movies. Live Free or Die Hard is my favorate.  I highly recommend this movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book caught my by suprise! I heard of it awhile back when everyone was reading it. I eventually gave in, and couldnt put it down! Wonderful book for all ages :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is more than I expected I love it for sure. I just want to say that if you don't have this game you need it.
B00407PNY2|2.0|Bullitt, 1968 film<br /><br />The story begins at night as the credits roll. There are gunshots while a car leaves a parking garage. \\"We lost him.\\" A man takes a taxi, her is being watched. This takes place in San Francisco (the major financial center on the west coast). Lt. Frank Bullitt is called to protect a government witness from organized crime. [Note the vent windows on cars.] Two men enter the hotel room then leave without talking. Bullitt arrives after the ambulances. An unlocked door? The doctors work on the patients. Who will take the blame? An older man enters the hospital and asks a question. There is a chase to the basement. There is a Code Blue in the ICU. Can this be kept secret? Chalmers shows up, the patient was transferred. Will Bullitt be blamed? A hotel clerk identifies a man. Chalmers talks to the Captain at a church. A writ of habeas corpus to produce a missing witness? Johnny Ross was caught with his fingers in the till.<br /><br />One car follows Bullitt until he reverses position. Both cars speed off (to provide the car chase that is part of most action movies since cowboys rode horses). This pads out the film. You see more scenes of San Francisco. [No seat belts!] Shots are fired, a car crashes and burns. The Captain learns the facts from Bullitt. Bullitt visits the motel that Ross called. That woman won't talk to the police. Her luggage contains men's clothes, monogrammed shirts. A facsimile machine sends a photograph. Was there a foul-up over the wrong man? [No TSA screening in those days.] Can this flight be recalled? \\"He's still my witness.\\" The passengers deplane. One man takes a short cut. Did passengers carry pistols then? There are jet planes on the airport runway. There are shots in the dark. Did Ross get away? \\"Get back!\\" People stare at a body. Bullitt returns to his girlfriend. Chalmers is driven away.<br /><br />The ending may surprise you; did you expect it? It seems like part of the story is missing. If they didn't pad out the movie they would have enough time to provide a better ending. While the identity of a person provides a surprise, it makes the authorities look like fools. A ten-minute car chase does not itself make a good story.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting forever for this to come out ... thank you amazon!!!!!! this game ids so fun and addictive
B0086700CM|5.0|I  absolutely love this game! I am so glad it is now for Kindle Fire!(: I am so glad my friend showed it to me!!(:
B006ON41FC|1.0|it wont let me download this app on my kindle fire. if the same thing is happening to u make a comment with the title rotten as I AGREE.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is by far the best game of this type I have come acroess. very frustrating and rewarding. a must buy even if you missed it as the free app of the day. I would buy it again if I had to
B002HRTMHQ|5.0|Discovered Mayer Hawthorne on \\"Live from Daryl's House\\" TV show. His music is infectious and wonderful. Now I hear his tunes on a \\"loop\\" in my head. A great talent.
B007JM4CWY|3.0|Challenging game and fun to play.  3 stars because it sucks juice from my battery big time.  Just updated though so we'll see if that fixed the battery issue.  Should have a description to go along with the update.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to play.A good, quick paced game to have fun with.A great way to escape reality for awhile.I like the big bold graphics. I really like the way you can change the left/right hand deal.Nothing is more annoying than than not having a feature like that.
0307951529|5.0|If you're interested in starting a micro-business but don't know where to start, this book is for you. It really is a blueprint for everything you need to know to get started. The only thing you'll need to find out on your own are your state's requirements for starting and running a business, and that should be relatively easy. I loved this book, and I don't regret my purchase at all!
B0086700CM|5.0|finally they have it for kindle for free waited a while after I found it on I phone so fun
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great read! Don't hesitate to read  this book, Some might think its a bit to racey but if you read all three books there is a great story line.
0446585025|5.0|I have found this book simply hilarious! This is my first Ellen book and just purchased Ellens previous books! I would have to say my Husband enjoyed this book as well! Waiting for more great laughs Ellen you are such a great comedian!
B0086700CM|5.0|its a very good app...  it never gets boaring and little kids like it too!  you should get it!  you will love and your girl friend will love it  lol!
B005VT42BS|5.0|Does exactly what I needed. Good for a quick network sniff. Reports back everything on your network segment. Nice stuff.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|Marware Vibe cover for Kindle Fire is not only stylish and provides moderate protection, but it can also double as a stand.<br /><br />Case: Very simple cover with a strap to keep the bookends closed when not in used to protect against dust, dirt and spills.  One little negative is there is no hook or place to put a stylus, if you have one.<br /><br />Protection:  In a closed position, the covered Kindle would survive different situations.  While I wasn't crazy enough to try, I think Kindle would survive a fall of about 5 feet(think of it as carrying it in your hands and dropping it on a floor.)  However, the cover would not provide much for a pressure damage(like dropping something heavy on top of it.)<br /><br />Stand:  Stand is mostly OK.  Just flip it over and it would get the job done if you plan to watching something on your Kindle Fire.<br /><br />For a price, this is a good investment where protection meets style.  If you need a cover desperately and not sure where to go, you cannot go wrong with this one.
0345803485|3.0|Fifty Shades is a decent story.....however it is very detailed and graphic. There are defiantly parts of the book that could have been omitted. That being said, the series is wonderful. The second book is better, less descriptive and the third is even better. The story developed a lot more in the later books. If it was a one book series, I would not recommend it, however, I say no questions asked....read the entire series!
B0086700CM|5.0|I have seen people play it on their phones and ipods. i wanted to play it soooo much. found out 2 days ago that its on kindle. My high score is like 1,114,568. try to beat it which most people have. anyways, I LOVE IT!!!
1609611543|3.0|I fing the book to be very helpful, lots of things I did not know. I fing it very boring tho\\"
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book is written very clearly. My friend Michelle asked me to help her to publish her first book for Kindle. It took me less than an hour to read this manual and to publish her first book [[ASIN:B008396VJ4 One Turn Deserves Another]]. Now I became an experienced publisher :). Thanks!
B0086700CM|3.0|Love this game...I found myself playing over and over.It def.challenges you.Very easy to play.My children play it and the graphics are great.I have no problems with this app.on my Kindle it plays great...
B0086700CM|5.0|This is it temple run nothing else it is just about perfect ,but if you have to many apps on your kindle it will start to lag a little bit . That is the only thing wrong.
B0086700CM|5.0|if u want a fun adicting game temple run is for u. unlock people,get powerups, and try to run for as long as u can!
B0086700CM|5.0|I tried out this game on my friends ipod. I found it fun and that night i looked for it on the Amazon appstore. They didn't have it but now that they do I almost never stop playing it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very easy transaction to download the book and easy to access on my iPad through my Kindle app. I prefer to get ebooks as opposed to traditional bound books. Only drawback is the upward creeping costs of ebooks lately.
B0086700CM|5.0|YEAHH we FINALLY get Temple Run on kindle fire. Used it already and it is great. it is FREEE too. I just love it :)
B0086700CM|5.0|I been playing this on the ipod and now I don't have to love it now they need to get move games from the Ipod  so we can play them on are kindle fire.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I love this album. Of Monsters and Men is a really great band. I listen to this album over and over and never get tired of listening to it.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|Upgraded to the DVD version of this movie instead of my aging VHS. I loved the movie as a child and still love it as an adult. My kids are growing up enjoying this move as well, and I expect that our grand-kids (when we have some) will enjoy it also. This is one of those ageless movies.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Its addictive and a lot of fun. just wish energy was easier to come by. I will recommend it to my friends
B0074MZSWW|1.0|When I first heard this album I thought this must be a joke, the second time I heard this album I said they can't be serious. I found the best part of this album is the space between the tracks. This should go down as one of the worst albums ever recorded.The vocals on this makes you wish someone would put him out of his misery. If you like irratating vocals like nails on a chalk board then you will like this album. If torturing yourself is your thing then definately listen to this. If you have no musical taste then you will like this album also. But as far as I'm concerned after hearing this multiple times I still think it was done as a joke. No one can be this bad on purpose.
B0086700CM|5.0|dont hesitate to get it!! its free, fun,  and occupies time! I totally recomend this!! drop everything and buy it now!
B005ZO6DIO|1.0|Dont waste the 18 bucks. If any other device in your house uses the same internet it takes 2 hours to watch a 45 minute episode.
0345803507|5.0|The story really picks up in this book. I loved it! I hope she will do something more with Christian in the future. A great read. I finished it in one day. :-)
B0086700CM|5.0|jeez it took them long enough! but anyway temple run is soooo addicting and dun so i definatly recommend this app.
B000SEI230|5.0|I think that A Walk To Remember should get 5 stars because it's a great movie.. In fact.. i'm watching it right now as we speak… This movie is a tearjerker and will make you think what if… What if this and that happened. Well it's a great movie. Try watching it sometime. Bye(:
B005723JSQ|5.0|This had to be one of my favorite books ever.  I have never written a review before so that should let you know how I feel about it.  The author is brilliant.  I love her witty back and forth banter between Sam and Poppy.  I also love Poppy's nuerotic little brain.  She lacks a \\"filter\\" and it makes for good story.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves romantic comedy mixed in with off the wall adventures.  This is absolutely sure to please.
B004KPLVW2|5.0|Tron the film is a classic and a pioneer in the realm of digital film-making, and it was great to see this film again after so many years.  But I spent more time reviewing the exhaustive collection of special features, which apparently includes some new features put together for the Blu-Ray release, as well as a whole host of older features put together for prior releases  on Laser Disc and DVD.<br /><br />The feature that I enjoyed the most was the Director and his son spending time going over all the Disney archives of Tron.  It was amazing to see how serious Disney is about preserving its history, but I suppose that is what makes Disney what they are today.  But more importantly, it was really interesting to see the bonding between father and son over this film, and as the director put it nicely, while he enjoys talking and discussing Tron with his son, it is the actual act of sitting down together and just speaking together that made it special and it certainly comes off that way.
B00799L3OM|5.0|Have been a fan of Yanni's for years, and saw him in concert recently in Greenville, SC.  Saw this concert on PBS and enjoyed seeing the setting in Puerto Rico as well.  CD/DVD set is great...thanks for making it available.
0345803493|5.0|Holy cow these books are hot! The story leaves something to be desired up until you are half through with this book, but the scenes are great! She is an amazing writer that makes you feel like you know the characters. I enjoyed all of them very much, and am currently reading the series again.
B0086700CM|5.0|my freind has an ipod touch and i always play it when he comes over looks like i dont hve 2 wait any more so happy :)
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I purchased The Hunger Games Trilogy with an expectation that I would not enjoy the books.  I wanted to review the books to determine whether they should be in our public school elementary level libraries.  Although I decided that they were too violent to be in our elementary libraries, I couldn't put the books down.  Luckily I purchased them just before vacation and I spent every spare minute reading.  The suspense and emotion in each book is quite captivating.  Although I originally thought the idea behind the stories was far fetched, I found them to be quite believable after just a few chapters in the first book.  I would recommend these books for a quick read to any adult and to any teen, as long as the teen has an opportunity to discuss the stories with an adult.  All 3 are easy, exciting and spellbinding reads.
B000I5XOVY|5.0|This is one of my favorite action movies of all time. I highly recommend this movie if you like Hugh Jackman or John Travolta.<br />Bought this at a great Price on Blu-ray.
0345803485|5.0|This was a great book. Easy to read and drags you in. It's a dirty romance book and not something to be reviewed in the same regard as great literary works. Characters are likeable, light bdsm and you want things to work out for Christian and Anastasia. Read all three in a week and found the series to be great. Highly recommend.
B003QP4BJM|5.0|Read an excerpt from this book and was fascinated.  I was very pleased to find a Kindle version and have enjoyed reading \\"the rest of the story\\".  In fact I'm thinking of using the book as the basis for a continuing education class at our local Osher Lifelong Learning Institute.  Thanks for making it available!
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely looooovve this game its like one of the best games ever I just got it on my kindle and it is amazing I .. love.. it awesome app u should deffinetly get it
B002IFT1ZA|4.0|This is one of the best film adaptations for a book I have ever seen.  I can only compare it to 'Lonesome Dove' for its faithfulness to its source.  Highly recommended.  Can't wait to see Season 2.
0307949486|3.0|I wanted to love this book. After all of the hype, I just knew that I was going to love this book. Plus the title was awesome so how could I not love this book?<br /><br />Mikael is a successful journalist with an impressive record but one bad story has left him broke with his career in shambles. Knowing that no publication would touch him with a ten foot pole, Mikael decides to take a break but out of no where he is extended a cryptic invitation from the owner of a well known company. Intrigued Mikael agrees to meet the old man who asks for his help in solving the disappearance of his favorite great niece, Harriet. All evidence would point to Harriet being dead except that Henrik has been getting flowers from someone for the past 35 years, a tradition that should have died with his niece.<br /><br />With the promise of a healthy sum and proof to exonerate him of his crimes, Mikael sets about trying to solve a case that no one has been able to solve for 40 years. Before long he is joined by Lisbeth Salander, a troubled young woman who finds herself intrigued by Mikael. Together they begin to sort out the clues but the closer they get to the truth, the more they find their lives are in danger.<br /><br />As I said, I wanted to love this book. The premise was intriguing although this isn't my favorite genre of novels. Certain things about this book just seemed to irk my nerves though. First, I hate that in novels like this, even when someone is getting shot at or nearly killed, they refuse to involve the police for some unknown reason. How does this makes any sense at all?? You can still investigate the crime only this time without the impending fear of death! And if someone takes flight the moment the police get involved then bingo! They probably did the crime. What really made me grind my teeth was when we finally discovered the truth. It just didn't work for me. I can't explain why it was so annoying without risking a spoiler but man, it just seemed stupid and not well thought out. Maybe the author was going for shock value over anything else.<br /><br />I didn't hate this novel, and I actually loved the way it started and the majority of the premise. Mikael was a likable enough character to cheer for. Lisbeth on the other hand was a very vague character, I sympathize with some of her hardships but Stieg offered little in the way of actual character development. I've decided not to read any of the other awesomely titled novels in this series even though my friends swear they only get better. I pick my battles and this one seems too daunting for my tastes.well thought out.

B0086700CM|5.0|amazing but sometimes freezes right when I'm about to jump or something... it gets kinda annoying. if they fix that I'd be totally happy with it.

B002QVZ71I|5.0|Forrest Gump. I would say one of a kind movie that when you watch it, you really get into it. Tom Hanks is doing best for this movie as he fully shown the character as should be is. Very good plotting and different scene like sports, action, drama, political, history, comedy, inspirational, love. So my husband and I both watched it and we both liked it.
0345803485|1.0|My cousin has been raving about this book and based on her previous selections, I thought it was definitely one I needed to read.  Didn't even see a sampling because there could be no way my cousin was wrong.<br /><br />Three days later, I'm kinda surprised that my cousin no longer is able to determine what good literature is.  What an awful book and I really thought there was something wrong with me since this book is all you hear about.  I went ahead and let a good friend of mine borrow it.  I got it back the next day.  She said after reading 6 chapters, she did not see the fascination...(to put it mildly, since she thought she'd be offending me by saying what she really thought)<br /><br />I better find a good book and rescue my cousin.
B0086700CM|5.0|they FINALLY got this AMAZING game 4 kindle fire!!!!!  I have tried playing this game on my friends ipod and I wanted it SOOOO bad but they didnt have it!!! I'm soooo excited now!!
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved it, and plan to buy them all. Its not for everyone but it works for me. I plan to read them again
0345803485|1.0|I am about halfway through the 3rd book and I have been struggling to get this far.  I am committed to finishing it, I suppose I am a masochist.  Anyway, this book came highly recommended by three of my co-workers and I'd heard it was extremely popular.  I have never read worse books in my life as I normally put them down if they are no good.  At any rate,  I have found myself wanting to poke my eyes out with all the MURMERING and OH MY's and APEX OF MY THIGHs.  Anna Steele is as stupid as they come, the sex, which happens at the very least 3 times a day is monotonous.  I cannot believe this is a popular read.  I'd get more out of a Penthouse stories booklet.  I am so disappointed and refuse to read anything else by this EL James person.
0345803507|5.0|This was a great book that ties up the loose ends. Good Ending. This was a great book that has some great twist in the plot. Finishes up the series nicely - great epilogue. Cant wait for the next works by the author
B007OWG3LM|5.0|With this album, Sigur R&oacute;s has really tapped into and enhanced all of the individual elements that make them such an interesting and moving band. Although, some of the professional (Washington Post) and blogosphere/forum reviews have claimed that this record is simply more of the same typical clich&eacute; Sigur Ros signature sound, I must protest in disagreement.  The record does have a certain heavenly quality that has been with the band from the start, but this album is a step in a more serious direction.  I was surprised by how intense and personal these songs feel, which is saying a lot considering this is the same band that gave us ( ) and Takk. The tones, the chord progressions, and the background choir make it all the more engaging, making this a standout Sigur R&oacute;s  album.  They are truly unique, in every sense of the word; their music helps us feel, it helps us believe in things, and it requires us as listeners to contemplate a deeper meaning of the word passion.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|keeps  you trying for more points!<br /><br />think the games could be alitgle more acurate but overall my kids like to play it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Could not put this book down.  Though there's a lot of repititions, the book was still steamy and interesting.  I think everyone has someone in their life who identifies with Mr Grey, a lost and insecure soul.<br />Good reading. Great book for adults only,
0553801473|3.0|First, some blunt honesty: no matter how much Dance and Feast fall short of the first 3, even Martin's worst efforts still outshine the majority of the scrapple in the fantasy genre.  Few authors in any genre know how to weave as compelling a tale as Martin, and even in this otherwise mediocre outing I was still compelled to read that next chapter.<br /><br />But Martin is in serious need of strong editors and Dance proves that point even more so then it's companion Feast.  Characters spend a long time travelling places, but never actually arrive anywhere.  Large sections of plot could be jettisoned entirely with no discernible impact on the overall narrative (see below for a detailed example).  Other characters undergo drastic changes in personality or behave so out-of-character that you must pause and re-read to make sure you didn't just slip into a fever dream while reading.  Even Martin's unique bard with a longshoreman for a father tone here slips into outright vulgarity and lifeless catchphrases repeated ad-nauseum.  If I hear one more character tell me \\"words are wind\\", a catchphrase which has seemingly captured the imagination of everyone in Westeros and Essos overnight, my head might just explode.  You can almost feel Martin desperately reaching for such classics as \\"Winter is coming\\" or \\"The night is dark and full of terrors\\", but here his attempts just fall flat.  In sum, the lack of real editing is the single most damaging aspect of Dance, even more magnified then in Feast.  As a fan of the series, I can only hope Martin gets some ruthless editors and heeds their advice moving forward.<br /><br />!!!!!!!!!!!!!SPOILERS DWELL BEYOND THIS WALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Detailing events happening concurrently (for the most part) with Feast, Martin takes us back to fan favorite characters such as Jon, Tyrion and Daenerys as well as some brief snippets from Cersei, Arya and others spotlighted in Feast.  More so in past books, there are multiple one-off POV characters given a few chapters to explore but with the exception of John Connington these are mostly duds.  Quentyn Martell could probably have his 4 chapters excised entirely without losing anything, while Barristan Selmy and Victarion Greyjoy are sorely underutilized.<br /><br />Jon's story is by far the most compelling here, showing us his attempts at reforming the Night's Watch into something that can actually withstand the coming onslaught of the forces of Winter by building an alliance with the Free Folk refugees.  His relationship to Melisandre is explored in more detail and begins to take on a new tone with strong hints that Jon could be the true avatar of Azor Ahai.  Theon/Reek, the epitomy of the villain you love to hate, is probably the sleeper hit here with some very revealing looks into the psyche of the man infamous as Theon Turncloak, now nothing more then a tortured husk of a man.<br /><br />Personally, the biggest let down is Tyrion's story as he is arguably one of, if not the, most popular characters in series.  After the incredible turn of events that saw him murder Tywin and flee Westeros, here his story and character both devolve into something far shallower while also shining a bright light on Dance's desperate need of editing.  Over the course of 1,000+ pages, Tyrion sets out on a winding voyage toward Daenerys that is never sufficiently justified and ends up, well, still traveling toward his goal.  At one point, Tyrion is kidnapped while traveling to Daenerys by the disgraced Jorah Mormont, only to be...taken to Daenerys?  This turn of events only serves to further slow Tyrion's pace while ultimately adding nothing to his story solely in an attempt to bring Jorah back into the mix.  Even worse is that this occurs almost immediately after it's revealed that Tyrion's original traveling companions are actually the presumed dead Aegon Targaryen being trained to fulfill his destiny of true heir to the Iron Throne.  Literally the exact moment when Tyrion's travels become exciting and reconnect with the larger story is when he gets kidnapped and it derails this major turn of events before it can even pick up speed.<br /><br />Furthermore, the motivation for assuming that Dany would desire the counsel of a Lannister, one accused of kinslaying and regicide no less, was hard to swallow already.  But why on Earth would Jorah think that bringing him to her would somehow earn her forgiveness?  By the time Tyrion is given a female dwarf love interest and begins jousting on a pig in a mummer's show (sadly not kidding) you begin wishing this entire chain of events was cut out just to spare this travesty from occurring.  And yes, the mummers joust is the same one he previously refused to degrade himself in thus triggering his downfall in the first place.  No single aspect of Dance better highlights the novel's problems then Tyrion's story, and that's a real tragedy.<br /><br />Daenery's story is also rather disappointing as it doesn't really start cooking until the last 100 pages or so.  Once again her story revolves around struggling to do the right thing in a world where every choice leaves at least some people pissed off and/or dead.  Realizing her dragons are dangerous and hard to control(gee, you think?) Dany makes the logical step to chain up and drive off her most powerful weapons instead of learning to wield them. You quickly realize that nothing Dany can do short of killing herself and her dragons will appease the people of Essos. By the midpoint, you are so sick of hearing the people of Meereen and Yunkai whine you wish Dany would just unchain her dragons and let them all burn.  Once that moment of unintentional carnage finally does occur, it only results in yet another period of lost drifting as Dany again tries to fill a new identity.  To me, ending her story this way would be like ending Game of Thrones with Dany wandering the Red Waste in despair instead of emerging unburnt in full glory with newly hatched dragons upon her shoulders.  We want this to be a momentous change for her when she becomes a true Targaryen conqueror but instead she is once more adrift in the weeds.  Once again, we see just how disconnected Martin has grown from his previous mastery of suspense and cliffhangers.<br /><br />!!!!!!!!!!!END SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />If you've come this far in the series, then you probably owe it to yourself to continue the journey, but like the character within, don't expect to actually end up anywhere.  Save yourself the money and wait for the paperback, or if you were already let down by Feast just read a synopsis online to fill in the story.  You can really sense how neither Feast or Dance, despite their immense length, feels like a complete story and the seams where they were split from each other are painfully evident.  You can't help but imagine how incredible they could have been if Martin's editors had been allowed to strip away the fat and merge two plodding, meandering tomes into a single epic novel.  As an ardent fan of the series, I can only hope Martin rights the ship in time for the two final(?) installments.

0307346609|4.0|World War Z is easily one of the smartest, yet most oblique zombie novels I've read. The author has created a zombie mythology for an apocalyptic future where a plague of walking dead overwhelm humanity. Unlike traditional storytelling, this novel doesn't have a main protagonist. Each section has a different narrator, speaking about his or her specific experience in the zombie war. Some of the narratives were weaker than others, while some I wish had been developed further.  I have to admit that I found the author's ability to understand and portray multiple ethnicities and philosophies quite impressive.<br /><br />By using the trope of a zombie apocalypse, Max Brooks deftly lampoons the military, celebrities, prescription drug companies, Middle Eastern countries, and a host of others. He doesn't spare anyone from his biting prose, and yet he also makes a case for the next generation being able to become much more than previous generations. Ultimately, it speaks to humanity's will to survive despite the horrors of an apocalypse.<br /><br />I found this to be a wickedly enticing read and had a difficult time putting it down. \\"World War Z,\\" is gruesome, gripping, and a certainly a highlight of the zombie genre.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I really like the game. but I have had to reinstall multiple times and lose all of my progress and start over because it starts doing weird stuff. something that is supposed to take five minutes to finish it's task will say &quot;time remaining: 319 hours&quot;. and then it started finishing all the goals for me so now I don't know what to do with it. I'm so frustrated with it!!!
B0086700CM|4.0|love this game but very delayed for the kindle fire but very fast for the iphone.wish it did not have such a major delay.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I admit I had to have some of my younger friends open the games for me,  but as a 40+ person I was able to unlock and open quite a few myself. Liked the periods when the points to unlock were half cost.

B001E45XT4|5.0|This is my third headset I've used for gaming on my PC and it's my favorite by far. My first one was extremely uncomfortable after wearing it for more than a few minutes, and my second one was slightly uncomfortable and didn't have great sound quality. This seems to have the best of both worlds. The sides fit over my entire ear so they're not putting any pressure on my ears themselves. The sound quality is good for both my friends' voices and the game sound (I've been using these a lot with Diablo 3 over the last couple of weeks), and my friends have had no complaints about the quality of my voice, which means the mic also seems to work well. I would definitely recommend these to someone who is looking for a quality PC gaming headset but is on a budget and can't afford the really high end ones.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|As a voracious reader, and a not-so-in-the closet pervert/freak, my interest was \\"aroused\\", for lack of a better word when I began to hear of all the hype over the Grey trilogy.  So, the next time I visited Powell's books in Portland (if you live nearby-I live 200 miles away-go, it's worth however far you end up traveling), I sought out the first Grey book.<br />To make a long story short (and it's becoming too late for that), I ended up getting a signed 1st edition of Exit to Eden, and bought Fifty Shades of Grey for my phone, instead.<br />Ah, here is the meat and potatoes of the review...<br />I hear the series has the most effect/draw on women folk.  It reads easy, in first person, almost like a diary or a journal.  There's a good chuckle now and then, and I suspect if you are anything like me, bits and pieces of the story I can remember from my own...early forays into other than vanilla relations.<br />It reads fast.  After the first few chapters, I went and purchased the other two of the series, and read all three in maybe a week, week and a half.<br />What I really enjoy, however, is that the characters seem like real people, despite the fairy tale, bubble gum world they live in.  The books aren't terribly graphic-I doubt you'll be reading them to your parents or kids-but the wife and I have taken to reading them aloud at night after the kids are asleep, and it adds a whole new level to the book.<br />Am I happy, am I pleased?  Absolutely.  Once they appear in print again, I'll purchase a set, in hardback, just to keep on hand.  Right next to that signed Exit to Eden, and the Beauty series...
B0064X7FVE|1.0|this app would be great execpt it never updates itself on kindle fire. on iphone its always up to date but on the kindle it still shows weather status from two days ago; not today's.

0439023513|4.0|This book was well written although it falls short on history and small company military tactics. I did feel that the emotional output of the book dipped considerably from the previous two books. Still, with its minor shortfalls, I did enjoy the read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Absolutely loved the book! Downloaded it on my kindle and it downloaded in less then a minute! I have bought all three books now and would recommend if you want a page turner book!
B001EAWMGA|5.0|I bought this movie without any preconceptions of its story. I just like sci fi movies. It turned out to be a very intelligent and well made movie. If you like Sci fi, with some dragons thrown in, then this is a movie for you. It is not my favorite movie, but it is an excellent one.
B0086700CM|5.0|this app is really awesome i like it cuz moving my fingers and and jumping is like so so so so so fun i guess cuz um...i just this app is fun so get it
B0086700CM|4.0|This is a good game. I am glad the kindle finally got this game in their app store. The only thing I don't like about it is it lags a lot. Sometimes you die because it lags. Overall its a good game.
B0086700CM|5.0|As you can see in my title this is not a fake review. I am telling you the truth when I say I am not old enough to work at the company that made this amazingly awesome game! If you get this game believe me you will absolutely love it! Ignore the glitches as you run and you'll enjoy it! :D
145162445X|5.0|Awesome book for people who are not physicist, but still want to know how it all works, destroying silly arguments of many \\"scientists\\" about \\"something from nothing\\".<br />Many interesting facts backed up by recent discoveries makes you read more, unfortunately science publications are not that easy to understand as \\"A Universe from Nothing: Why There Is Something Rather than Nothing\\" is. Must read for everybody who care about modern science.<br /><br />BTW.<br />Not quite sure why physicist would HAVE to be philosopher, but I'd urge every philosopher who write about physic/biology/math to have physic/bio/math degree.

B0083SBM7Q|5.0|Disney and Marvel Studios together for the first time both marketed and distributed by themselves an mega-blockbuster hit with The Avengers. I've seen this on the first showing on opening day during the record breaking opening weekend, I loved every minute of it including the Hulk who steals the show while Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark/ Iron Man continues to amaze while Loki is the ultimate supervillian better than his role in Thor! As time of typing this, the third highest grossing film of all time worldwide besting Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2, domestic besting The Dark Knight, the highest grossing Disney movie of all time both domestic and worldwide, highest grossing film of 2012 domestic, overseas and worldwide, highest grossing comicbook movie of all time, and highest non James Cameron film of all time both domestic and worldwide. If you have seen it once or more than once or perhaps not seen it yet see it on the big screen before the blu-ray and dvd comes to stores soon! I love Hulk throwing down Loki and before that he hits Thor by mistake! As for people going on this movie against The Dark Knight Rises just who's going to make more money, please stop that, they both going to do well anyway like being the top two box office hits of the year so it's not no contest these movies are made for the people, by the people and it's the year for superhero movies, who knows The Dark Knight Rises could do a billion dollars but not as strong as The Avengers so it could happen. Anyway, enjoy The Avengers on the big screen and on dvd and blu-ray 2d and 3d soon with many extras like deleted scenes and much more! You won't be disappointed!
0446572993|4.0|This is the first time I have read a book by David Baldacci.  I enjoyed it.  I thought the suspense and pacing were good.  There were a few things that seemed a little farfetched and several times when I was able to guess the \\"big reveal\\" well before it was presented in the book, but that did not distract from my overall enjoyment.  I will definitely check out some of his other books.  If you enjoy authors such as James Rollins and David Silva, I think you will like this book.

I know that not all people will or already don't like the movie, but if you haven't read the books or seen the movie yet, read at least the first book before watching the first movie, which is available for pre-order! I recommend the books and the movie to everyone who hasnt read the books or seen the movie yet!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I keep my kindle in my purse with a bunch of keys and other whatnots that had me worried about scratching it up. I bought this case to protect the kindle, and it's been doing a great job. It's easy to pop the kindle in and out of, though I don't see a reason to do so. It's durable, and has held up against my keyring nicely. It's lightweight and stylish, and I love it.<br /><br />I don't use my kindle for movies/TV, so I have no comments as to its fold-over stand feature.

0812979656|1.0|After reading so many wonderful reviews of this book, I thought I had to read it. The book started out slowly and it was really fractured in the sense that it jumped to the present then to the past, then to something completely unrelated to the plot at that time. I thought it was a quirky way to present the story but went along with it because I expected it to turn into this amazing story that I heard so many reviews say it was. I tried, but never got there. After reading almost halfway through the book, I simply couldn't take it anymore. It was so incredibly boring, confusing, and filled with events that weren't even connected in any way that I couldn't take it anymore. I gave up. There's only been a handful of books I could not read from beginning to end, and this is one of them. I gave it a chance to grow and see the characters develop, thrive, etc, but it never happened. I wish I could have my time back so I could have spent it on more worthy books.

B0073U2FB2|3.0|Emile Hirsch and Max Minghella team up as internet entrepreneurs wishing to strike it rich with a geo-social networking website. Unfortunately for them, the idea is stolen (poor Max, two movies in a row) and the characters have a very bad start to their weekend in Moscow. Well, problems arisew when an alien species descends like electrical impulses from the sky. Playful fireflies the size of your head float down innocuously... until they start zapping randomly and turning people into confetti.<br /><br />More character driven than anything, The Darkest Hour presents likeable, relatable characters in the face of danger. The unseen is more terrifying, and, like The Mist, nearly undetectable movements from something meaning to kill you - particularly when accompanied by a creepy childlike giggle - are absolutely frightening.<br /><br />Special Effects for this film are obviously superb. Scene design as well. Seeing a crashed jet inside a Moscow mall is a complete gut-bomb, a wonderful precursor for foreboding post-apocalypse existence. Although, the surrounding scenery of Moscow - if it was really Moscow - could have been filmed a little less obviously; it's as if the filming followed a Fodor's guide to Moscow.<br /><br />The problem with this movie is the Swiss cheese script and Deus Ex Machina. The aliens can destroy entire buildings, but can't break through glass or penetrate a Faraday Cage? Really?! The aliens can't go over water, even though they have clearly mastered the art of flight? (This just in, they came from outer-space) The fact that Hirsch is just a nobody who gets saved, but the movie ends with him acting like a pseudo-John Connor who wore his daddy's BDUs and pretended to play soldier for a day. Let's not forget the bus that miraculously drives via alien energy, about a half-mile, yet somehow ends exactly where Hirsch needs it to, as if he informed the driver of the upcoming stop. Oh, and what about the time Hirsch chucks some space metal at an alien like he's some sort of 20-something [[ASIN:B00005RT3M Henry Rowengartner]]?<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie somewhat, but mostly when shutting my mind off. The script is far too easy to pick apart if one were so inclined. In the end, it has alien energy sources that were lucky they didn't arrive when Ben Franklin was still alive. Maybe if Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is successful Bekmambetov will have enough Hollywood capital to make Ben Franklin: Alien Killer.ike he's some sort of 20-something [[ASIN:B00005RT3M Henry Rowengartner]]?<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie somewhat, but mostly when shutting my mind off.

B003O86FMW|4.0|Had to read it to get to the end of the series, but it was like the first book, stripped of it's flourishes and rushed to get to book 3.  Not the best of the series.
0439023513|2.0|While the first 2 books were pretty good, this one is just plain boring. Echoing the concerns of the other reviewers I must note, that while the ending is quite okay from the storyline point of view, the book to often answers the question 'what?' instead of 'why?' or 'how?'. Lacking in details for the decisions, relationships, characters, the only thing that holds you through are the memories of the previous books. While there are a few nice moments, all-in-all, the book leaves the reader numb and that's just not the feeling I, as a reader of a book, am interested in...

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|So you've just spent days of your life reading this series and you expect something good to happen at the end to make it all worth it.  This was a deviously well-written series that truly affects those who read it.  I'm pretty sure I was clinically depressed for a couple of months after finishing the series and felt like I was returning from a war zone with PTSD.  The \\"real world\\" doesn't look the same after reading this series.  Enjoy at your own risk.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|After reading Hunger Games & Legend (Marie Lu), it was nice to get away from the dire state of the Earth and read something that painted a nicer picture of our future.  Of course there were things that are predictable, but that's not kept a secret since it's based on Cinderella right?  I loved this book and can't wait for the sequel to come out.

B004EPYZV2|3.0|Was disappointed after all the hipe and the shorts on the sceens in India. It just did not live up to my exspectations, too short, unbeleivable and<br />too predictable of a story line.  Could have been much better. Paid top dollar for the blu-ray combo set, would have been better off to wait for it to be released on one of the major networks.  Tom is just becoming out-dated it appears to me. Although I like him as an actor, its just he's seen better days.<br />Lets see if he can redeem himself in the Rock Show drama coming out this summer.

0307474259|4.0|The author does an excellent job reviewing the literature (i.e., scientific research)surrounding the link between diet and obesity. (His previous book, Good Calories, Bad Calories also did this but was difficult to get through. This book is much better for those who have no medical background.)Specifically, I enjoyed reading about studies conducted 50 or more years ago regarding the diet/obesity link. I can remember as a girl (I am now 50) my mother eating a hamburger sans bun. She was definitely of the \\"June Cleaver\\" generation and NEVER had a weight issue--even after 4 kids.It was also interesting to read that the author's take on why women tend to gain fat after menopause---the discussion on hormones and the scientific experiment on the mice whose ovaries were removed was simply the best explanation I have ever come across. Very informative book.
B001EN71DG|3.0|Ok I am confused. I have not purchased this box set yet because I have some questions, anyone who can shed their SW knowledge on me it would be much appreciated. After a lot of internet research it seems there is no definitive answer as to which home video release is the best and most accurate to the original theatrical versions. It seems before the 1997 release of the special editions the home video releases were for the most part unaltered. Therefore any copy of SW that was made before 1997 should be unaltered to the untrained eye. So that said, if you can get a wide screen copy of SW that was made before 97 you should have a pretty accurate copy. Now comes the question of aspect ratio. There are wide screen laser discs of the trilogy available that were made before 97 (93 to be exact). Everyone says that this box set is a laser disc transfer but it is 4:3. However if you look at this: [...]  this person is comparing the widescreen laser disc to the 2006 release of the theatrical versions. They both appear widescreen. So does that mean the 2006 version of the theatrical releases are the most accurate? It would seem if the 2006 are widescreen and theatrical then they would be the best of both worlds. Am I missing something?
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I bought that book first as audio book as I had to drive for many hours but the 1200 km were not enough to listen to the whole 21 CD's... I was so grasped that I needed to know what would happen (but didn't want to listen at home) and so I ordered the book on my Kindle.<br /><br />It's not a vampire story, nevertheless there are vampires...<br />It's not a witch story, nevertheless there are witches...<br />...but it is much more than one more vampire/witch story.<br /><br />The main character is a witch that seems very strong, but she's been refusing her gifts for years and she must learn to accept herself to accept her \\"powers\\". Discovering herself, she also discovers hidden secrets, love stories, incredible powers ...and links with vampires indeed.<br /><br />It's clever but still very accessible, a must read for people loving initiatic trips (but still completely fictional, remember there are witches and vampires... and demons and also mundane people) and grasping adventures.<br /><br />I pre-ordered the second book and it will be wirelessly downloaded into my Kindle the D-Day... unfortunately I've still a few months to wait ;o(.<br />Pierre-Yves Kohler - Switzerland

B003WTE886|5.0|I'm in such awe of this brilliant, illustrious young woman.  I can't say enough good things about her, and no matter how I type my sentiments I couldn't possibly merge them feasibly enough to do her persona justice.  So I will let the facts, in large part, do the talking.<br /><br />First, and probably most importantly, she has largely gotten herself to the place where she is now. (ok...she had some help from her parents.  What lucky kid hasn't at some point?)  She has written every song on every one of her albums.  That fact alone says loads about her.  She simply won't settle for allowing somebody else to do her work, she wants to work 'till she has sweat on her brow and an original masterpiece to show for her passion.  Genuine is this girl's middle name.  It's old school song writing for Tay and she likes it that way!  She never needed the professionals.<br /><br />Three facts I found very interesting are: #1. At 13 Taylor was signed to a major record label, but she cut ties because she wasn't confident the company would impart upon her, enough of the dedication and attention she wanted put into her albums.  Very clearly she is smart beyond her years and greatly intuitive; this could have been a huge mistake to make and she single-handedly avoided it.  #2. She is the first female country singer, since Reba McIntire in 1994, to be nominated for more than 5 Country Music Association awards.  7 out of 13 awards went to her.  This is Reba-freaking-McIntire we're talking about; Taylor is rubbing elbows with musical royalty!  #3. Her album Speak Now features 11 tracks that were on the Billboard Hot 100 simultaneously, plus she alone wrote all of them.  She is the only female artist to have ever achieved this feat.  (One more related fact: all 14 tracks on Speak Now have been on The Billboard Hot 100 at some point or other.)  Only besting her are David Cook and The Beatles. David Cook had 11 hits, which were individually sold and debuted by him on Idol.  The Beatles had14 singles on the list for 1 week and then went on to have another 12 singles on it for 2 weeks.  Neither of these two groupings were compiled from a single album nor can The Beatles claim credit for being the sole writers of the singles in question.<br /><br />I can't even begin to start on all the awards Taylor has won (and Amazon's comment window would probably reach capacity before I finished, haha!) so I will leave it to you all to read for yourselves.  Ms. Swift has pulled in a large amount during the small period of time she has been present on the music scene, impressing seasoned musicians and musical legends alike.  When she was a mere sixteen she released her first album.  Now at 22 and several albums later she's achieved what it takes most artists, at the very least, a decade to garner.  If anybody has a serious leg up on the whole music scene it's Tay.  Songwriters and their associates should watch out; she may leave a few of them vying for a spot at their own businesses.  That is if she keeps her head on her shoulders and keeps at like she has been, which I certainly see happening what with the iron clad focus she has on her career and it's effects on her fans.<br /><br />Speaking of effecting her fans, I failed to mention a stand out accomplishment.  People are Taylor's real love, and that is why she makes the incredible music she does, the WAY she does it.  Using the power of her fame for the good of everybody, Taylor has made it a mission of sorts to benefit people everywhere.  Children and parents in her home state Tennessee can be confident that extra measures are being taken, thanks to Taylor enlisting the help of 2007's Governor Bredesen, to insure that their internet experience is not being muddled by perverts and predators.  Quite dear to Taylor seems to be Red Cross as she donates to it frequently, and in large sums, often coming out of her own pocket.  The Red Cross' Disaster Relief Funds (there is more than one) seems to be another charitythat has found favor with Taylor, for she lavished them with all of the funds raised from her merchandise sales at the 2008 County Music Festival; an enormous amount of money must have been amassed!  And just to further prove how serious she is about what she does, and it's impact on others, she is giving 14 million dollars to build a new education center at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum.  All so that others can learn and enjoy music!<br /><br />Taylor Swift is sure to be remembered in the same the fond fashion as old favorites like Elvis, Barbara Streisand, and Led Zeppelin.  She truly is a force to be reckoned with.  Check out not just Speak Now, but ANY of her albums.  Or even just listen to a few songs!  It doesn't matter which you treat your ears to, I promise you'll take the bait hook, line, and sinker, and come back to buy.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|Hands down this is my favorite photo app. I've tried a few out there, but this has the best effects with a very easy to use interface. Here are a few things that make this app stand out:<br /><br /> -Ability to use gallery pics: Down at the bottom there's a green button with little lines horizontal through it, click that and you can choose photos from your gallery to apply effects to. It's also awesome that once you're in your gallery you can scroll through pics without having to hit the back button and start over at the beginning of your gallery. In other words, when you are in the Paper Camera app, looking at gallery pics, there are two sets of arrows, one for scrolling through gallery pics and one for changing the effect.<br /> -Variety of effects:  there are 13 effects total! They are really neat effects, not just tinting your picture different colors. My personal favorite is Neon Cola-which gives everything a cool highlighted look, great for taking pictures of objects, sometimes looks a little weird with people. I also love Sketch Up-makes people and scenes look like they are sketched, this one is pretty cool with just about any picture except scenery (like a sunset or pictures that are \\"busy\\").<br /> -Customization: Each effect has 3 different customization sliders for changing the details of the effects, like :edges, saturation, shine, slickness, vignette, tone, ect. This can really help you get your picture just perfect.<br /> -Sharing: Of course any great app has the ability to share via social networking sites and email/text. This app has all this integrated, of course.<br /><br />I put up a few of my favorite pictures just to show some real world examples of how great pictures turn out using this app. I have to confess, I bought it on the market when it was on the $0.49 sale, but now that it's full price, it doesn't really matter where you buy it. Worth the few bucks!
B005UBNKWO|5.0|Great chip for the price.  It easily overclocks to 4.0Ghz without special cooling and while still being stable.  The benchmarks show it blowing all other similarly priced combinations out of the water and even beating more expensive processors on occasion.  I have no complaints.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I read Beautiful Disaster after Amazon suggested it after purchasing 50 Shades of Grey series. I read it in one day I LOVED it that much! If you are reading 50 Shades this should be your next book no BDSM but the same intensity of the relationship.
B00003CXB2|5.0|The movie was made and released at the cusp: when the Old Hollywood was waning and the New Hollywood was just starting to define itself. For this reason the film appears at times dated, especially in its portrayals of Arabic historical figures. Alec Gluiness, a fine actor, portrays Faisal, but his accent is positively embarrassing. He sounds more like Foo Man Choo. Similarly, Anthony Quinn's portrayal is one-dimensional and wooden.<br />Everything else is a delight. Movies do not get any better. The cinematography is made with  total respect for the desert. The film conveys what it feels like to be in the desert, without having to tread in the sands. This respect the film gave inspiration for other cinematic wonders such as \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" and \\"Gandhi.\\"<br />It is hard to be disappointed.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|This book was a joy!  Kate Morton develops her<br />characters so beautifully and everytime you think you<br />have it figured out....  It changes!  Love her!

0802473156|5.0|This book truly saved my marriage.  I read it first and my husband chose not to read it.  I left him and took a job out of state.  He read the book just before I left but I was committed to taking the job. After he read it, we sat and cried together realizing how we needed to speak each other's love languages.  We spent the next two years living in different states, but spent weekends and time off learning to love each other in ways that made the other feel loved.  I quit the job after 2 years and he sold several businesses so we could spend more time together. We took our first real vacation of 35 years and have continued to spend quality time together since then. The past 3 years have been glorious even though we are experiencing many trial and tribulations from outside sources, we continue to strengthen our love within our marriage.
B0054LRR3S|3.0|First I'd like to say; this isn't \\"dubstep\\", \\"post dubstep, or \\"future garage\\".<br />This is album is basically indie-electro pop with soulful vocals with a few instrumental tracjs. It has a house music aesthetic see it as how there are various singers on this producer's tracks, but Sampha  happens to be featured quite a few times.<br /><br />The lyrics could use a little more development but overall it's very solid.<br />I can't really compare this to any particular electro artist, except maybe Royskopp.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love this app. They must have worked out all the bugs because it works great! great detail,  large print,  vivid screen. I use it on the kindle fire

His passion for discovering the origin of the universe and relating his findings is very informative and entertaining.

B004SBQGHS|3.0|Bonus levels should not be locked on the paid version. I rarely use my facebook account and I have no intention of &quot;liking&quot; a game on facebbook just to get the bonus levels and since I paid for the app I shouldn't have to.  Would give the game 5 stars except for this.
B0086700CM|5.0|its so cool cause you never run out of any money or things and the obstacles get harder and harder
0345803485|3.0|Look, this is not great literature. It's a fun read but I did see the similarities to Twilight. Rich, gorgeous guy couldn't possibly be attracted to clumsy, I'm-not-worthy girl. Throw in a psycho woman stalking the girlfriend and this is Edward and Bella with different names. All that said -- I did find it interesting and enjoyed reading it. I learned a few things about BDSM. The sex scenes were graphic (or explicit as one of my friends said) but they did get a little repetitive. I also wish she had come up with a better phrase than \\"inner goddess.\\"
B0086700CM|5.0|My sister had it on her smartphone so I checked on my kindle fire and they had so I got it and started to play and it started to get addicting its so awesome !!!!!!!!!!

B0086700CM|5.0|I think temple run is the best because I could not find a game I like I found it and then boom I am like this is fun!
0345803485|1.0|It takes a lot for me to knock a book. It takes a lot more for me to be unable to finish one. Right now, I'm stuck on the second chapter of 50 Shades of Grey. Yes, the second chapter. I'm afraid if I read anymore I'll find myself re-enacting scenes from The Man with the Screaming Brain and beat myself half to death with my Kindle.<br /><br />I actually decided to read this based on the strength of the negative reviews. To me it sounded like one of those books that was so terrible as to prove hilariously entertaining.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />I knew it had started out as a Twilight fan fiction. I've read the Twilight books, I've laughed my ass off at the movies, and I've been a reader and writer of fanfics since before Stephenie Meyer published her little fantasies in the first place. If you've read more than a handful of fanfics on any subject, odds are you've read some pretty bad fanfic. I thought I was prepared for the worst.<br /><br />I. Was. Wrong.<br /><br />How can one possibly prepare for lines like \\"His voice is warm and husky like dark melted chocolate fudge caramel... or something.\\"?<br /><br />A word of advice for daredevil readers who think their highly trained sensibilities can endure anything. Don't push your luck.
B0036RCVJM|5.0|This book was referred to me 10 years ago, and I only just purchased it for my Kindle.  The horrors that Mr Lomax lived through are almost hard to believe, but I know they are true for an uncle experienced a similar fate.  This book should be required reading for senior school students.  Lest we forget what war is truly about.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Downton Abbey is excellent, we are hooked.  However, we will now wait for the dbvd's to arrive.  We tried streaming and it was very mediocre.  Amazon is no netflix.  Having tried this because we bought the dvd, i can say that the quality is disappointing.  The video clarity is soso, and one never gets the credits -- the segment simply stops mid-sentence.  We will stick with netflix<br /><br />-- especially as you support ALEC.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is the best. game I ever played love it love it love it love it love it love It love it
0345803507|5.0|I absolutely love this series.  I am not a fan, in general, of stories that are purely focussed on sex. However, I gave this one a chance since there was so much talk about it.  I am so happy that I did! Yes there is sex, yes it is not mainstream sex, but the story is so amazing.  The story of Ana and Christian is so great that I feel like I know them and their friends. Just give this trilogy a chance and you will not be disappointed.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|[[ASIN:B007K3TNA8 Draw Something!]]After downloading four drawing apps this is the one I play all the time on the Kindle Fire. I have games going with my two daughters, two randomly chosen players and several online friends. My daughters were hooked the first day. Neither one plays online games. They're just too busy, but draw something is a game that you can play for a few minutes at a time when you have time.<br /><br />You aren't playing against the other players as much as playing in tandem with them. You make a drawing using one of three words the game supplies, they guess and you both get equal points. You redeem the points for more colors. After the other person guesses what your drawing they draw and you guess. This is all done in your own time, not real time. In other words, you don't have to be online at the same time as the other player.<br /><br />Some of the artwork from Draw Something I've seen in the Facebook game site is amazing and elaborate, but the way I play is usually the quicker and the simpler the better. Although, I have gotten carried away now that I have bought a set of lovely colors. I did a parrot I wish I could snatch off the screen. I'd frame it and hang it on my wall if I could.<br /><br />There are a few features I'd like to have, such as the ability to save your artwork and the other person's, too. My daughters have done some awesome pictures.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with the free app. I don't even notice the advertising. I will pay the $1.99 eventually to get more words.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|lots of fun! easy to play, no matter your age! I really enjoy watching scrat run across the screen, catch him...if you can!
B002Q1YDLI|3.0|This book was a follow on to Something Borrowed. As such it was good to be able to follow the characters and see what happens to them. It was light entertainment for a summer day.

B005LAIHIQ|5.0|Just saw Dark Shadows and thought it was a fantastic movie. Clever, entertaining, beautiful and funny. This movie is for fun, and if you go see it with that in mind, I think you will really love Johnny Depp's hilarious and at times even moving performance. Gorgeous sets, color, costumes and Johnny Depp has great mannerisms as Barnabas.

B005RUV6RO|4.0|The middle of season 2 got kind of boring just sitting around on that farm, there wasn't enough action and too much drama. I had almost given up hope for the show until I saw episode 12 which def sent everything in a much needed new direction. The writing also kind of bothers me. You start to dislike some of the characters and find them annoying. Rick the lead character also kind of gets on my nerves that he always trys to save everyone. I also kind of wanted to see Hershel go down with his farm like a captain goes with his ship, but rick had to ruin it... The show also keeps around way too many unnecessary characters that should have been killed off much earlier in the show. It felt like season 2 was on a tighter budget and they had to keep all the action for the final episodes. But the show is still pretty good and I couldn't stop watching. I'm waiting for the season finale. 4/5 stars.
B006CHML4I|4.0|This watch is a fantastic first watch in the 50-100 dollar range. The automatic winding is a great first step and the watch does not seem to be too inconsistent. It seems to gain five seconds every week, and on occasion when the watch is changing the the day it will shift out of your chosen language, but will eventually shift back correctly. The band leaves much to should most definitely be changed if possible, currently I have a dark brown leather band that looks remarkable. Great watch overall!

B002MHTHQ2|5.0|This is a tremendous double CD set. It's actually 4 albums plus an additional bonus track. Disc 1 features arrangements by Quincy Jones and Ralph Burns. Disc 2 has arrangements by Roger Neumann, Alf Clausen, Teddy Edwards and Jimmy Heath. The personnel passing through includes many jazz greats such as Clark Terry, \\"Snookie\\" Young and Blue Mitchell on trumpet, Urbie Green and Steve Turre on trombone, Marshall Royal, Frank Wess, Frank Foster and \\"Fathead\\" Newman on sax, Freddie Green on guitar and Sonny Payne and Roy Haynes on drums. Of course there's Ray Charles himself on piano, organ and a few vocals. With so many members from the Count Basie band this is a great lineup. If you love Big Band and Ray Charles the way that I do this must be in your collection.
B007L96VCY|5.0|Amazing Job! Congratulation Mr.McCartney and Crew! i hope that the coming soon released of the Archives Collection will be so perfect.

B001NHNG64|2.0|I recently discovered the Reacher series and had to backtrack to begin at the beginning. This was the third book I read and I could have skipped it and not missed a thing. Implausible from the beginning..Why would the kidnappers take a 6'5\\" gorilla of a man cross country instead of just offing him when they torched the stolen car? Reacher ignores several chances to escape and get help for what seem very flimsy reasons, and as the story continues he is kept alive no matter how much trouble he causes. Although I have enjoyed the other Reacher novels this one doesn't add up.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am NOT someone who enjoys reading erotica. I read this book on the request of a friend who wanted my honest opinion. She also conveniently left out that this was a book about sex. So perhaps my opinion of the book should be taken with a grain of salt, although I still think my opinions valid..<br /><br />The beginning of the book was OK. Although, I seriously have to question how much research the writer did before hand. Its about an American, college-aged woman, and yet I knew IMMEDIATELY that the author was British. Its not a bad thing, but it makes the main character sound like she's in her 40's or 50's and not her early 20's. It also felt like she had a couple macros set up on her computer she threw in on every page. The repetition is distracting. The constant reference to her \\"inner goddess\\", the repeated \\"flushing\\" (not blushing) in scarlet, crimson, and stars and stripes (er, she blushes in stripes?), the constant cocking of the head, pursing the lips, \\"Crap! Double Crap! Triple Crap!\\", clambering, grinning, etc. I'm sure if I counted each and every one of those, they would number in the triple digits.<br /><br />Overall, the book left me laughing. Yes, laughing. The sex scenes were anything but hot and steamy, they were downright unbelievable. She's climaxing on every other page, she's apparently a natural at every sexual act, regardless of the fact that before Christian, she's never had a relationship with any man. The characters were unbelievable. Every time the author mentions Christian's fingers, she makes sure we all know how long his fingers were. By the end of the book, the only thing I could picture in my mind's eye was an animated Tim Burton character who's fingers grew a half an inch every time he appears on screen. Not to mention how \\"perfect\\" she made Christian. Ridiculously rich, sculpted, hot, an accomplished pianist, a pilot, a soldier against world hunger all by the ripe old age of 26? Did I forget to mention that he's also apparently hunglike an elephant? By the time I finished the book, Ana reminded me of a grown up version of Bella Swan, who we see practically catatonic on the last page. Their relationship even started the same.. \\"I'm not the man for you...\\" What I see here is yet another weak female character with no self confidence or self respect.<br /><br />Take out the sparkly vampires and insert sparkly fetish laden sex, and you have the rated X version of Twilight. The characters are equally transparent, predictable and shallow. The writing is about the same caliber. Although, I'd have to hand it to Stephenie Meyer, at least she kept my attention (in books only) through until the end. There was no repetition.<br /><br />I will not be reading the remaining Fifty Shades of Grey. How's the meme go? Bad smut novel is bad. If I had one thing to pass on to the author... I know that this is a fantasy, a fictional book, but if you write another book.. Make. It. Believable.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is solitaire for the kindle.  It is free so why are you reading reviews instead of downloading this game to play?
B005PK1G76|5.0|I bought this for my Baby Jogger City Select and it works perfectly.  I keep it snugged up against the top of the handle and I still have room for my toddlers to ride on the glider board. The only downside I can think of is the lack of cover.  If it rains, your phone is getting wet!
B000VPPMXO|5.0|Several things .... I talked to the folks at iRobot and you can have a max of three of these in \\"lighthouse\\" mode since each room takes about 25 minutes and three rooms is all the battery will last. You can use as many as you want in Virtual Wall mode. These work well for the 780 BUT the item is white and not black like the pictures. It's all in the part numbers.

B004ZISVWC|1.0|If you think this might be some kind of cool \\"Blair Witch\\" type movie, think again.  It is BORING, and completely lame, with no twists, exciting sub-plots, mysteries, or anything else of the sort.  And if you think you might want to watch it simply for the special effects and action scenes, please reconsider. lol The effects aren't special, there are no cool action scenes, and there is no scare factor either.  This film is just plain boring.  And to top it all off it's subtitled throughout.  Which means unless you're Norwegian, you are reading the entire lame script as the whole BORING movie plays out.  I cannot believe this thing got such high ratings!!!  I was completely disappointed!  It didn't even have any \\"its so bad its awesome!\\" factor, it was just boring, what a waste!!!

0446572993|5.0|How does baldacci do it. Totally different theme from previous books initially but then gets you into the stream and keeps one sitting on the edge of the seat. Guessed reasonably early who the real bad guy was but not the reasoning behind it all. Again he writes a best seller in my mind. Great read
B007BVOF8E|1.0|this was a terrible movie......The acting was slightly enjoyable but the way in which the plot came together, and the contraction of the climax was pathetic.<br /><br />Only watch this movie if you can borrow it from a friend for free.
0345803485|1.0|I don't blame E.L James, if someoen offered me a book deal, I wouldn't say no. I blame Random House. They are too far above this type of tripe! Badly written, repetitive, no story line, no character development...I know it started like as Twilight fanfic, but even that should be subject to the usual rules if it's going to end up in print. Really, utterly awful. Put your cash through the shredder if you're that desperate to waste your money.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! The well developed characters were always entertaining and I enjoyed every steamy page. Read the trilogy in about 2 weeks. It was really a great story, and I can't wait to see what E.L. James writes next!
0439023521|4.0|I think that this book, given the popularity of the series and recent release of the film adaptation, likely needs no introduction. At the time when I picked it up, I was taking a break from a poorly written indie book and being that the movie was getting rave reviews, decided that I would grab a popular and commercial read.<br /><br />The premise of The Hunger Games is relatively simple and a somewhat of a typical underdog story. Set in a futuristic world, there are 12 districts that are forced by the Capitol to provide 2 teenage tributes (1 boy and 1 girl), to participate in a televised fight to the death. The story primarily follows Katniss Everdeen and her journey from volunteering as a tribute to save her younger sister from what I shall call, televised death row... to her training and ultimately, participation in the \\"games\\".<br /><br />It may have been that I picked up this book at the right time and was really struggling to read the book I was crawling through, but I found that this book was easy to pick up, read, and complete. Ease of reading however, does not necessarily mean a good book or a well written story, but I will get into that.<br /><br />Plot of The Hunger Games<br /><br />As an author, I must say that the storytelling itself was the area that I picked up the most from this book to carry through in my own writing. It is far from perfect and is laden with plot holes, but Suzanne spins a good tale of world building and engaging the reader.<br /><br />I had to remind myself that this is a young adult title and as such, I could excuse the fact that there is a wealth of content here that could and should have been expanded. The ability to write some strong messages was mostly missed. I wanted to know far more about the history behind the hunger games, the uprising, and the people of Panem. This was an area that was sorely missed for me. There were snippets of information which were fantastic to read, and then I was left wanting. In my opinion, the book could have been greatly improved by exploring those details and providing the reader with a far greater view of Panem, its history, culture, and much more.<br /><br />However, what Suzanne does very well is to suck us into the story of Katniss, her struggles, and dare I say it... a \\"Twilightish\\" love triangle that kind of bugged me and was undercooked, but I am glad that this story is actually a decent read.<br /><br />This does leave us with another angle to all of this, a \\"discovery\\" style of storytelling, where we find out bits about the world as we go along. I enjoyed the trip to the Capitol and what they discover there, and how they felt living the \\"rich\\" lifestyle from their \\"poor\\" district. Again, this is a major topic that could have had some strong messages written... and didn't. A few odd comments from characters here and there that never really struck gold for me.<br /><br />Although my first novel also travels at a fast pace, I felt that I found myself already in the games far quicker than I had expected and a little quicker than I would have liked.<br /><br />This was the area where things really soared in the story for me, and I found myself glued to reading. It was not groundbreaking storytelling, but it was darn good! Suzanne does have a talent for delivering world building and vivid details through storytelling and that is something that I will definitely learn from.<br /><br />Where I was very much annoyed was the times that many events that would have been absolutely fantastic to read about... were practically ignored. For example, when Foxface died... it wasn't described at all... only the results of them. Or at the end of game days, pictures of dead adversaries would just appear in the sky. No detail, no scenes, no explanation. Convenient for the story to continue? Absolutely. As much as I do love this story, to just kill off characters for the sake of progressing the story is lazy writing and problem solving.<br /><br />The ending of the book was a bit predictable for me, but still enjoyable to read. I do fear, however, that I really don't know where the sequel will go from here... and I hope that it doesn't turn into a love story with not much of anything going on.<br /><br />Charactarization<br /><br />This is a mixed bag for me.<br /><br />Although Katniss was very well described... I found myself liking Katniss's strength and courage, but really disliking the internally emotionally damaged character that just can't seem to decide which one of her love interests to go for. It doesn't make much sense. She has Gale, who she spent so much time with but can't see herself having a relationship with... or Peeta, who saves her life and fights for her throughout the games, is in love with her, they share kisses, cuddles, etc... but she can't fall for him? What is she... The ice queen? By all counts, she should be genuine in her love for Peeta. This is where, by the end of the book... I seriously began to dislike her and feel sorry for Peeta.<br /><br />Katniss embodies what I really dislike about girls who toy with the emotions of others. Even with her history of her mother and hard times, it doesn't excuse it.<br /><br />The remaining characters in the Capitol and Katniss's family are somewhat well described, but I found myself really wanting to know what they were thinking or feeling during the games. As a reader, I was denied this... and for what I have read so far of Chasing Fire, it's dealt with unsatisfactorily .<br /><br />The tributes from other districts were poorly described, with exception to the tributes that interacted closely with Katniss... ie. Rue, Peeta. I pictured Cato and Thresh as almost mindless brutes.<br /><br />There was not many dimensions to most of the characters, and that annoyed me the most. I really liked Peeta, Rue, and Cinna the most.<br /><br />Writing Style of The Hunger Games<br /><br />This was easy reading, and the story flowed well on the pages... but there were more cliche's in the writing than I would have liked... it was loaded with them. \\"Shaking like a leaf\\", etc. There were some nice descriptions of locations, but I never found myself saying \\"Wow, these prose are just fantastic\\" or feeling lost in visualisation.<br /><br />I did get sucked into the story, but found that the writing style was fluid... but somewhat flat and simplistic. As you would expect from a commercial title (although I have found plenty in commercial titles before).. there were no grammatical or spelling errors in sight.<br /><br />Overall opinion of The Hunger Games<br /><br />At the end of the day, I enjoyed the read... more than I had reading most titles in a long time... but I was left feeling like it could and should have been so much more. I do eagerly await seeing the movie, and hope that they did a good job of adaptation and screenwriting.<br /><br />This is a good, solid read... but I wouldn't expect standout writing... just a good story told smoothly. The pacing is good and held my interest through most of the book, even though I had felt that there was a lot that should have been written in. The writing is good, not exemplary... but good. You can easily slide into the story and keep turning the pages, and that is always a good sign of a solid novel.<br /><br />I have already started to read the sequel, so she has definitely done something right :)<br /><br />It's an entertaining ride, and I do recommend the read to anyone thinking that it's all hype and no substance... you will most likely be pleasantly surprised.k was a bit predictable for me, but still enjoyable to read.

B004SKHJF2|1.0|Another crap app, that cant differentiate between and market and a damn OUT OF DATE amazon app. The market version is TWO REVISIONS higher than the Amazon Market.
0345803485|4.0|I just read it for the fun, i'm no literary giant, but it was fine by me. If the author wrote one from Christian's perspective, I would buy it, if they made a movie about it, I would go see it. Yeah i've read a lot of the comments about it being badly written, and all that but hey, it was fun. My friends and I have read all 3 and we are not middle aged housewives.  Not letting our boyfriends read it though, not giving them any ideas. Lighten up people.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|what happened to the two year anniversery update with the starfruit other than that rant great game really great game
B007JM4CWY|5.0|If you like a game that takes some thought. This is it. Looks easier than it is. At first I thought where's the challenge.  Then on the 5th game I actually had to think. I like it a lot now.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|This is the first book I have read by this author and was blown away by the characters and the chemistry between them. This is an amazing and wonderful story. I am so glad I stumbled upon it.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Truly great use of technology to the glory of God. A constant blessing on all my devices Android, iPhone or Blackberry
0345803493|5.0|I loved the first (grey) book. Even with it's slight irritations (repetitive at times). But, the second gets even better! You find out more about both of them and why they are the way they are. There is more action and more involvement with the others characters. I enjoy how the author keeps the reader's interest and does'nt make the reader wait for questions to be answered  . You grow to love them both, and are eager to see them happily ever after! I can't wait to read the third!
B0086700CM|4.0|I was soooo excited to see temple run availible for kindle fire. but the graphics are kind've funky and sometimes when I go to jump it freezes up and then it says I ran into the tree. but other than that it great!:)
1452101426|4.0|Here we go again, another PIXAR book out and up my PIXAR shelf. This one's a little thin compared to the others but it's still pretty cool and has all the aspects you come to expect in an Art of Book from this premier animation studio. Couple things stand out to me, the biggest one is the talented team of artists on the project. Steve Purcell, his pal Mike Mignola, Character design legends Carter Goodrich and Daniel Lopez Munoz, along with artists Steve Pilcher, Huy Nguyen and Noah Klocek, AND my favorite bits, sculpted foam and acrylic paint maquettes from long time PIXAR artist Tia Crater, among many others fill the volume. Ive never been to the old country but Im sure it looks quite a lot like this- Dark, Rich colors, and Cold.<br />I saw Secret of Kells a number of years ago and seeing the Brave trailer I right away noticed quite a bit of similarities, but now that Ive seen the book and have a little bit of an idea of the film itself, Im a little bit more comfortable with realizing this is definitely a different movie.<br />If you like art of books, I blog about the best of artbooks on The Last Outpost, so check it out if you're so inclined: en-b.blogspot dot com!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is the best game I have. I love it so much. I want more updates though. But in the end I absolutely love it.
0345803493|5.0|I loved reading these books it was very interesting and intense character (male) but one thing i relised is that the author has too much of repeat words so often...overall can't say i didn't enjoy it cause after all it is a great fantasy and romance, if you like reading romance I highly recomand these books!
B0086700CM|5.0|love this game. got it because it is the free app, and I am addicted. its challenging but still really fun
B0086700CM|5.0|Finally not temple rum or fake temple games FINALLLLLYYYYYY!!!!! Yay shout out to TayTay.this Mariposa.Taylor  u know me and so xoes tori grace.
B0086700CM|3.0|U know, it's quite HILARIOUS how there's so many (probably billions out there) just like me who are so ASTONISHED and TOTALLY DELIGHTED that Temple Run is FINALLY ON THE KINDLE FIRE. It's just that... I thought it was kinda messed up that WE ALL (mostly) had to vote with 5 &#9733;s! So... even if I would truly put 5 &#9733;s..... I put 3 &#9733;s instead just to add a..... um..... review with 3 &#9733;s?
0345803493|4.0|Well, I must say that I enjoyed book two more than the first.  Maybe I'm just used to the poor quality of writing by now or maybe I'm just feeling more for the characters.  Whatever it is I think I'm unfortunately hooked on the series and now will be obligated to read the next in the series.<br /><br />It's sort of like watching a movie on an old VHS tape.  It's still entertaining but the picture quality is really bad and you sort of think how much more you would enjoy it if it was on a blue-ray or even a DVD.  Just think how much better this series could have been with some strong editing.<br /><br />At any rate, I thought book two was better than book one and like I said, I'm going to have to read book three now.
B0086700CM|5.0|I like pickles.. and cherry poptarts<br />they are yummy. I'm just wanted you all to know. iloveyou so much (:<br />from dezzii
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Season 4 is the best yet. It's what everyone has been waiting for since season 1.Even though you knew it was coming for years you'll still be shocked to see it happen.  Once you watch you'll pray for September.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|just amazingly fantastic and easy to use.makes my kindle fire light up like a fancy calculator from the year 2777
B0086700CM|5.0|It's intense! Start running away from the monkeys and then you can't stop playing tryng to get further.  The more you play you receive coins. But really there's not much to buy! The game is to run, jump and avoid trees, fire or clifs. Run till you drop and then restart running it's 100% addictive. Great game!
B000H6SXMY|3.0|My husband got this for me as a surprise and I was really excited. I was a little confused at first though because the seasons arent broken up, it has six sections with a few disks in each that makes up the series. So if you have a fave episode you have to go into the booklet and find it. That is the only con I have seen so far, as far as the disks not playing I havent had an issue with it like I have before with DVD's I bought from Amazon (Ive had three seasons of How I Met Your Mother and one of House that were totally ruined before I even got them). I am glad that (for now) there is no problems finally with a purchase that actually doesnt skip :)
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game! I have it on my phone and couldn't wait for to come out on the kindle!
0345803485|1.0|I downloaded the Nook version while away on vacation. My first impression was how sorry the writing was, which was a little less impressive than reading the newspaper. But then maybe the characters would be exciting enough to get me interested. I am about 250 pages in, and I can tell you that isn't so. So much missed opportunity on character development; there actually is a little interest there, but not enough for me to pick it up and finish reading. What really got me is that the main character, Christian Grey, is not even exciting. And the way she has an orgasm at the drop of a hat, what's the challenge here? So I actually picked up my other book, The Secret Life of Germs, and finished vacation with that... which by the way, is totally awesome. Sorry, but learning the secrets of my body from the inside out was more interesting than two people who could never seem real.<br /><br />Yesterday, I had a choice... go back to 50 shades or brush up on Organic Chemistry. Guess what I chose? I really wanted to like this book. Perhaps her next novel will be a step above.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|great and convenient app. I use it when grading students ' work and when working on my budget. definitely recommended.
0345803485|1.0|I'm not entirely sure why this book has become so popular.<br /><br />I'm seventeen years old and, as a girl who was once a fan of the Twilight saga, it does not surprise me to learn that this trilogy was based on fanfiction.<br /><br />Though I believe many derivative works can be of good quality, I'm confused as to why someone would go so far as to turn their \\"alternate\\" story that borrows someone else's characters into a novel. All you're doing is changing the names for legalities sake.<br /><br />This reads like just the template it was modeled after; a fanwork. It seems there was very little copyediting involved here, much like the reading experience of the Twilight saga itself. Though I have not yet read the entire book, the sample pages on Amazon alone tell me I should not waste my money. This is basically Twilight sans vampires with softcore porn where the Cullen family used to be. The writing is poor, the characterization bland, and James' knowledge of prose seemingly limited. I am also of the opinion that she has very little knowledge of the Pacific Northwest. Though I, as a fanfiction writer, know that such projects take effort, it seems odd to me that with just a few things changed, fanfiction can become a bestselling series.<br /><br />If you want to write a novel...come up with your own ideas and stop borrowing those of other writers. Settling for that just to get published makes you look cheap, tacky, and like you're selling out. BE ORIGINAL!<br /><br />Be original.
B005DOKL3E|5.0|You will like it if you want to keep your kindle protected, the problem is that once you take it out of the sleeve your kindle can slipped out of your hands. But is nice and don't take too much space.
B007OWG3LM|5.0|Somehow, Sigur Ros's inspiration never flags, never fails.  Valtari opens like the wind out of heaven, singing like sunshine through a cloudy sky, sparkling flecks of stardust raining through the air.  Jonsi's vocals, as ethereal as ever, are gorgeous and heartstopping.  A sense of longing, of waiting and fulfillment just around the corner pervades this album.  It is intoxicating, maddening in its slow build, and leading to crescendos that not only provide catharsis but somehow bring you higher than when you began--listening to this music is pure bliss.  There is nothing to compare this to musically other than Sigur Ros itself; if you have never heard this magical band, this is an excellent place to start, but honestly, every record they put out has been incredible.  I keep waiting for them to put out something somehow less than sublime; fortunately, it hasn't happened yet.  Stunning music, so incredible.  Give this your heart, let it wash over you like solace longed for and given, like joy that surprises, like the sweetest sadness ever.  Stunning, lovely, simple, and graceful.  Highly recommended.

B007IQX1G4|4.0|To be fair, this would probably be a 1-star film if I were coming into it with a blank slate.  There are no really good people in here.  There are lots of \\"nice\\" people, but that's hardly the same thing.  And yet, comparing this to The Great Gatsby, I see that we've got the same core concept -- old flame has new babby and \\"must be saved\\" according to obsessive ex -- but this retelling has more breadth of sincerity than Fitzgerald managed with his over-emphasis on the Leisure Class.  Theron's (and Cody's) rendering of Gatsby is genuinely deranged, and visibly so set in contrast with surroundings from even the first not-glamorous-at-all McDonald's French Fry.  The driving obsession isn't a positive driving character trait, it's a near-fatal flaw.  And while it feels mostly more honest, heartfelt, and creative than Cody's other work (Juno, Jennifer's Body), 90 minutes of scathingly bitter introspection is a bit rough on the system.  Hence, 4 stars as a system cleanser for the great American novel, The Great Gatsby.

B0052OZJQO|5.0|A vivid cinematic experience in 3D, the music of \\"Pina\\" was a stirring, contemporary, ecclectic mix of European music accompanying the fluid and expressive interpretive dance. It's great that there's a soundtrack of the movie. The music is the lifeforce the dancers move to in the movie and help tell the story of Pina Bausch's life and work. It's wonderful though, to be able to take that music home, listen,[[ASIN:B0051USPN8 Pina Box (Blu-ray 3D + Blu-ray) [Blu-ray] (2011) Pina Bausch; Regina Advento]] and have one's imagination invigorated in different ways by the music alone. While this soundtrack is not a complete collection of all the movie's music, it's still a great collection of its most memorable pieces

B005KP7EK4|4.0|Great story, great scenery, fine acting--a really solid western.  I'll admit I'm a western lover, but I don't think you'd have to favor that genre to enjoy this movie.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I've always loved the Star Wars movies, but watching them now for the first time in blu-ray I am blown away again, especially for the prequel movies that were made for this high definition. It's great having all the movies in one set. I haven't yet watched the three discs of extras, but I'd have bought it without them.<br /><br />The package pulls out and pages through like a little book, with one disc per \\"page\\". The one thing I don't like about this product in particular is that the pockets the discs slip into can be kind of hard to get the disc out of. You may need a thumbnail. I didn't damage the disc at all getting it out, though.
0307730697|5.0|What needs to be known about this book is that it represents the very best that our country has been blessed to have. I can easily say that this is one of the most impactful stories that I have ever read. Any one and everyone who knew Adam, and told their story in this book all said the same thing, that he was a humble and loving man, and fearless. I can say that I took away a great deal from Adam's story of his life, and his family. His faith, compassion, and humility was an example I feel anyone who believes in Jesus or any belief system should mirror. His story is amazing, emotional, and inspiring and I am so thankful to have been blessed by it.

0307594165|5.0|Morrison's Home is an almost allegorical tale which confirms that one can go home again and that home is where we heal from the trials and tribulations of a too complex world.  Frank Money and his two best friends hate Lotus, Georgia, so they enlist in the army and are sent into combat in Korea.  Frank survives, and the receipt of a letter about his sister, \\"Come fast.  She be dead if you tarry,\\" starts him on a journey home.  Frank meets numerous obstacles, including his own PTSD, but arrives in Buckhead (a wealthy section of Atlanta) in time to rescue his sister and return to Lotus where the local ladies heal her while Frank settles into life in Lotus.  Morrison achieves a lot in less than 150 pages.  It's a very satisfying book which I highly recommend.

0393088774|5.0|End this Depression Now! is a good primer for those not fortunate enough to have studied Keynesian economics in college or who have been seduced by Republican arguments that reducing the deficit is in some obscure way more important than generating jobs. The book is an overview on why the recession has happened and what needs to be done to correct it. Since the European situation is often cited by Republicans as an argument against sustaining an adequate social safety net in this country, he explains how and why some of the countries are having financial difficulties and why the US will not have similar problems. He stresses how sound social policies help the economy.  He also refutes the Republican distortion that we need to concern ourselves about the deficit instead of working aggressively to create jobs. Although Krugman touches on some of the policy issues, suggesting that President Obama's efforts have been too timid and that the Republicans have totally distorted the issues, the book focuses on economic principles and is written in language which most people can understand. It's certainly a great deal more lucid than the economics instructor I had in college. His points are that we know how to correct the problem because Keynesian principles work and have been adequately tested in the past so they can be confidently used to stop this depression. I highly recommend it to anyone concerned about the high unemployment in this nation and in understanding why it exists and what our policy makers need to do to correct it.

Put it in the sheath took it home. after taking it in and out of the sheath a few times i noticed it was DULL. I looked on you-tube and many complaints from people the sheath to me has made the knife 100% unusable because I don't use or like dull knives once i spend more $$ and buy a different sheath i will use the knife. but it is impossible to use the factory junk sheath and keep this knife sharp.  The blade is awesome. The sheath on my $12 mora is alot better than the junk on this.  Im not a fan of the handle material they used on this but it is durable and works so that is fine for the price of this knife its good. I gave it one star because it comes with a 100% unusable sheath....<br /><br />I was very surprised by the email from Ka-Bar. I will NOT buy from them again. which stinks because I am a MARINE and they make the most famous knife for USMC and KABAR does NOT stand behind its products at all.......

B005LAIHQS|5.0|My wife and I re-watched the first two MIB films just before going to the third outing....<br /><br />There are those who thoroughly lambasted the second MIB for being so far less entertaining than the first film...<br /><br />Those people need to see the third one. It will wipe away the disgruntled memory entirely.<br /><br />MIB3 has everything that the first film had and more. The humor is there, the adventure is in abundance, but there is also an element of pathos as Agent 'J' finally discovers the secret of why Agent 'K' is such a taciturn stoneface. This involves Time Travel, a young 'K' (spot-on Tommy Lee Jones imitation by Josh Brolin), a killer alien advance man for an invasion force, and another alien who understands String Theory like a cosmic 'Pinocchio'.<br /><br />If I go on about this film, I`ll have to struggle to avoid spoilers, so I will just leave it at this;<br /><br />MIB3 IS A FUN FILM.<br /><br />ANYONE WHO SNARKS ON IT HERE LIKELY WAS EXPECTING TO BE DISPLEASED WHEN THEY WENT INTO THE THEATER, SO THEY COULD IN TURN, HOP ON THE INTERNET AND SHOW WHAT A HIGHLY-OPINIONATED-HARD-TO-PLEASE WANNABE-CRITIC THEY ARE.<br /><br />So...Just relax and go have a good time.
B0061S073A|4.0|This app is great for keeping my 2 year old from changing settings, purchasing things, etc on my Kindle Fire.  I do wish that (as other reviewers have said) you could allow access to certain books or videos. I have downloaded the Kids Place Video app add-on but it doesn't recognize my Amazon video content... hoping Kiddoware will put outsome updares that would allow these items (heck I'd even pay a couple of bucks for it).  This is definitely worth you while if you have kid apps that you want a toddler to have access to without free range of your Fire.

B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This show is so addicting.  I find it so compelling that I can hardly wait for Season 3.  Everyone else thinks I'm nuts, but I have a few co-workers who are crazy about it. And that's just it.  I don't know anyone who's in between on this.  You either like it or you're obsessed with it. From the characters to the story line.  It's not just about Zombies runnning in every direction.  There is a real human story going on here and you're sucked right into a world of \\"what if?\\"  Could something like this happen?  Well, I hope not, but watch the show and you'll start to believe it's real. Where do you go next?  Where's safe?  Where can you hide?  Whom can you trust? Will you live until tomorrow?  This fear grips you as if you were running for your own life, and you clutch at your throat (at least I do) the whole time.  The sheer horror of  a world like this, and it's not just gone in a couple of hours; you have two seasons to survive. More, more, more, is all I can say.  Don't let this show slip away.  It's too good.

B007ZGO7EM|3.0|It does just fine for all basic functions but I just wish you could hit the function key multiple times to accomplish the same thing several times for example 60+60+60 you have to hit each number instead of just hitting the plus sign again to add the same numbers multiple times. So I pulled out a regular calculator when I needed to add a large quantity of like numbers.

1451627289|5.0|I'm not much of a Stephen King fan, but I am a fan of time travel fiction.  Stephen King has written a masterpiece.  Unlike most time travel, there are no idiotic paradoxes about how someone turns out to be their own father, etc.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the author's take on time travel, and how the past resists change and how a traveler in time creates certain harmonies that keep repeating.<br /><br />The plot as others have mentioned, is a high school teacher is particular moved by a student's essay about how his whole family was killed.  He then find out the owner of a local diner has been traveling into the past, and the owner wants him to do it too to save Kennedy from being assassinated.  Our hero goes back to save the student's family and save JFK, and along the way winds up living in the past for 5 years to do so.<br /><br />Much of the book is about how man from 2011 lives in 1958 - 1963, and the difficulties he has living this false live while falling in love and living back then.<br /><br />The end is particularly bittersweet, and I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />If you enjoy time travel fiction, get this book!

B0086T71MM|1.0|Mad Men has jumped the shark.<br /><br />All the characters are now wrecked beyond any way to fix them. Joan turns tricks. Pete pimps her out. Roger does nothing. Lane is an embezzler. Peggy is given more responsibility than ever before and then throws a temper tantrum in response before walking out the door. Don yells at everyone and the writers tell us about ten more times what a genius Ginsberg is without anyone asking (or caring). Megan becomes yet more unlikable. And all this agony for a second-rate account like Jag?<br /><br />We get heavy-handed symbolism to tell us that advertising (or business) and prostitution are really the same thing. How profound. How shallow and how poorly written.<br /><br />They have written themselves into a corner. There isn't anywhere for any of the characters to go now.
B007SGM084|3.0|I rate smack in the middle because it is not about the books content at all. Don't get me wrong, I have every intention of reading these books BUT...why is it 2 cents cheaper to buy the kindle books individually instead of the bundle? And why is the kindle version so much more than the paperback version. If you don't want to make it cheaper than the paperback version, at the very least it should be the same price. I prefer the kindle version because I lack the space to store physical books. In this case, though, I may go purchase the physical books to save the money. It seems to me that someone is setting the prices and not really thinking about it for the consumer. I would say they are looking for the money, but I can see all the pricing and if I am complaining, it is because the price really does matter.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was frustrated reading this book by page 60. I was going to give up on the whole thing but wondered what the hype was about. So I skipped to the erotica.<br />I enjoy Erotica and have read better scenes in the Harlequin Seduction series or even Rachel Gibson. There is so little description and her climaxes are excessive to the point of annoying. Perhaps Ana falls in the tiny percentage of women who climax when hearing your name.<br /><br />I agree with another reviewer who wrote \\"If you take out the parts where the female character is blushing or chewing her lips, the book will be down to about 50 pages. Almost on every single page, there is a whole section devoted to her blushing, chewing her lips or wondering \\"Jeez\\" about something or another.\\"<br /><br />There is so little substance to the writing and the characters. The descriptions are shallow and the characters unbelievable.<br /><br />Not a fan.

0439023513|4.0|This is the final book of the amazing Hunger Games series, and I was very disappointed to see it come to an end. Suzanne Collins wrote a great ending for Mockinjay, and I did not feel like it was an open ending either, and I was very glad that didn't happen.<br />This book is based entirely on the revolution. They are all in District 13, going against the Capitol. Things were so intense and awesome. The plans and strategies were planned out so well, everything felt real. I feel like Katniss suffered a lot in this book. The absence of Peeta, and other situations were very hard for her.<br />Even though there were many moments that made me smile because they were finally going to get their freedom, I felt very sad at others. Suzanne broke my heart in this book! Many things happened, good things and bad things, and I didn't know wether I should smile or just cry with my pillow.<br />I did not like how the relationship with Gale ended. I was happy, but I just hoped things ended a bit better. This book was an extreme roller coaster ride, and I did enjoy every part of it. Even though I did like the first two books more than the third one, I still did enjoy the final book of \\"The Hunger Games\\". *Tears up, when realizing there will be no more Hunger Games*

006197806X|4.0|*do not read if you have not read Delirium. This review is spoiler free for Pandemonium only.*<br />Pandemonium was a highly anticipated 2012 sequel for me ever since Delirium left be heartbroken and at the worst cliffhanger I have ever read so far. I am glad to say that Pandemonium did not disappoint, while the direction of the book took a totally different unimaginable turn from what I expected, I couldn't read the book fast enough to find out how Lauren is going to resolve this and what will be the famous cliffhanger that I've heard broke readers' hearts again.<br />Pandemonium starts with a couple of days after the ending of delirium and for a while I was definitely confused with the two changing POVs. the then and now. I was so frustrated and confused that I wanted to skip a hundred pages or so to find out when was then and when was now! but I'm glad to say that Lauren didn't leave us hanging for too long and I found out a couple of chapters in what was going on. Pandemonium held its own ground to Delirium. It reminded me a bit of Shatter Me, especially the brewing romance between Lena and a newly introduced character and while that left me torn between their happiness and the fact that it is a bit too soon after Alex. However I was definitely shipping them and I loved how the romance did not overtake the book like Delirium. I especially loved all the plotting and fighting, that didn't get boring at all. Now, coming to the cliffhanger and some of the revelations, I have to say, I predicted every single one of them. The cliffhanger was totally obvious and I knew the only ending people would react so much towards was the one I had in mind. Other small revelations include Lena's mother, and the resistance.<br />All in all Pandemonium, while slow at the beginning, was an addicting novel that I couldn't put down, and wished wouldn't break my heart, but still broke it in the end. Whoever have read Delirium, PLEASE go pick this up right now!!
B0086700CM|5.0|Love it. was very happy it finaly came out, I have been waiting like many others for it to come out.
0061692042|5.0|Richard Ford's numerous well-regarded short stories --- as well as (in particular) his critically acclaimed Bascombe Trilogy consisting of THE SPORTSWRITER, INDEPENDENCE DAY (which won the Pulitzer Prize and the PEN/Faulkner Award), and THE LAY OF THE LAND --- have placed him firmly at the center of the American literary establishment. His new novel, CANADA, an elegiac work set in the American West and, yes, in our neighbor to the north, will further cement his reputation as one of our most skilled writers. Ford's control of his prose and pacing here is no less than masterful, and the story he tells --- of one man trying to come to terms with the events of his childhood over which he had no control --- is universal.<br />Of course, not everyone's childhood was as tumultuous as that of Dell Parsons, whose parents were arrested for bank robbery in the early 1960s when he was 15. But many of the issues with which Dell --- who narrates the novel from the point of view of his much-older self, now an English teacher worlds away from the milieu of his youth --- grapples will be familiar to anyone who has tried to make sense of childhood, of distant or absent parents, of the circumstances that made us what we have become.<br /><br />Dell and his twin sister, Berner, have been brought up in a military family, bounced from base to base before landing (without much justification) in Great Falls, Montana, where no one in the family seems truly happy. Dell's father, Bev, is the quintessential Southerner --- larger than life, endlessly optimistic, constantly comparing Montana (unfavorably) to his roots in the Deep South and asking his children if they feel like Alabamians (which they don't). In one of the great fictional mismatched marriages, Dell's mother, Neeva (short for Geneva), couldn't be less like her husband. She's tiny, unattractive, and a secular Jew with failed aspirations to further her education and teach college. Her academic yearnings and her feelings of superiority mean that the whole family is somewhat alienated from life in Great Falls, leaving Dell (and the reader) to wonder whether in a different place, under different circumstances, his story might have been very different, too.<br /><br />Dell is convinced that his father was destined to become a small-time criminal. His father's interest in Bonnie and Clyde seems to extend beyond fascination and toward aspiration, and whose entire life --- including a convoluted and illegal money-making scheme that started during his dad's time in the service and culminates in the robbery --- seems pointed in that direction. But Dell remains mystified by his mother's role in the heist, and his efforts to understand her motivations form a major theme of the novel. The idea of looking back at one's childhood and youth through the lens of adulthood, of trying to understand one's parents as individuals rather than as extensions of one's youthful self, is a universal pursuit, and one that Ford explores skillfully and perceptively.<br /><br />All young Dell wants is to settle down, excel at school, learn the rules of chess, and figure out how to raise bees. He's a quiet kid, with no friends other than his sister --- whose own desires revolve around leaving Great Falls as soon as possible. When his parents are arrested and his life is turned upside down, Dell must come to terms with a very new and uncomfortable sense of his life's possibilities and limitations. However, the narrator Dell claims that \\"to concentrate on Berner leaving would make all this seem to be about loss --- which isn't how I think about it to this very day. I think of it as being about progress, and the future, which aren't always easy to see when you're so close to both of them.\\" This conflation of loss and progress, of past and future, forms the heart of the novel's quite different second half, which finds Dell continuing to come to terms with the lot of his parents, even as he navigates his own path toward the future.<br /><br />CANADA is not a happy novel, but it is a beautifully introspective one. The way that Ford unfolds his story with care, restraint and the utmost thoughtfulness is a model of storytelling by a writer completely in control of his craft.<br /><br />Reviewed by Norah Piehl on May 25, 2012

0399159029|5.0|The traditional job of the police procedural is for the cop --- representative of society and all that is good and decent --- to catch the criminal, solve the crime and restore the social order. But what if the social order itself is criminal and evil beyond belief? What does a cop do then?<br /><br />This is the question that Bernie Gunther faces in PRAGUE FATALE, the eighth book in Philip Kerr's series about the Berlin cop (the first three books were issued together under the title Berlin Noir). Bernie was a Berlin police detective until the Nazis took power. Then he went out on his own for a bit, but in 1938, the Nazis brought him back onto the force under the policy he calls \\"no bloody choice.\\" Bernie is not a Nazi; indeed, he hates them. But he now finds himself automatically part of the SS and their intelligence unit, the SD, although he is not Gestapo. The dreaded SS controls all police in Germany and its occupied territories.<br />\\"The thought of suicide is a real comfort to me; sometimes it's the only way I can get through a sleepless night,\\" Bernie says at the start of his narration of PRAGUE FATALE, as he cleans and prepares his gun. It is the fall of 1941, three months after Hitler's disastrous invasion of Russia. Shortages are appearing in Berlin, and on occasion British bombers are able to reach the city. Bernie was sent with other SS \\"Special Action Groups\\" of police to Belorussia. What he witnessed there was the wholesale massacre of Jews who were supposed to be \\"relocated.\\" He is sent home in disgrace because, he says, \\"I'm a bit particular about who I pull the trigger on.\\"<br /><br />Haunted by what he has seen, Bernie figures it is just a matter of time before he either kills himself or the Nazis arrest him for his disloyalty and send him to a concentration camp. But they still need experienced cops in the civilian police of Berlin, and Bernie keeps busy investigating the discovery of the headless body of a \\"foreign worker\\" on the railroad tracks.He also stumbles upon a beautiful woman apparently being sexually assaulted in a train station during a blackout one night. He chases her assailant until the man is struck by a taxi and escapes only to be found dead in a park soon thereafter. He investigates that as well. Bernie decides to help the girl, withholds evidence for her, and keeps her out of the hands of the Gestapo despite his discovery that she might have some innocent link to spies, or what the Nazis call \\"terrorists.\\" They soon are involved in a torrid affair.<br /><br />The woman rekindles life in Bernie again, but then something really bad happens to him. His nominal boss in the SS, General Reinhard Heydrich --- the most feared Nazi leader --- needs the services of a good cop in the confiscated Jewish estate that serves as his headquarters in occupied Czechoslovakia. Hitler has just put Heydrich in charge of that country, and the General is throwing a party for many of the SS high command, which Bernie describes as a \\"menagerie of unpleasant animals --- rats, jackals, vultures, hyenas --- who had set for some bizarre group portrait.\\"<br /><br />And then there is Heydrich. Kerr writes: \\"Heydrich's eyes narrowed. I preferred his profile. When you saw his profile it meant he wasn't looking at you. When he looked at you, it was only too easy to feel like the helpless prey of some deadly animal. It was a face without expression behind which some ruthless calculation was in progress.\\"<br /><br />When one of the General's adjuncts is found shot to death in a locked bedroom, Bernie is put on the case and ordered to locate the killer before Hitler finds out and the murder embarrasses Heydrich in Berlin.<br /><br />This is a fascinating story that moves along at a rapid pace. And we cheer as Bernie gets to question and be impertinent to the Nazi brass, although it is less clear why any of them don't just shoot him dead on the spot. Kerr's Gunther mysteries are often compared to Chandler's Marlowe stories inthat Bernie is the ultimate knight errant. But they are far darker because we know that people like Heydrich once existed and we remember what they did.<br /><br />The locked-door murder investigation moves along to its inevitable conclusion, but then Kerr does something truly terrifying in PRAGUE FATALE. He takes us into the basement of Gestapo headquarters in Prague with Heydrich and Bernie to witness the \\"water bascule.\\" Every American today knows this particular torture by another name --- waterboarding --- where the subject is strapped to a board and dunked to the point of death under water. The head of the Prague Gestapo proudly tells Heydrich, \\"With all due respect, sir, there's not much worse than the water bascule. Short of death itself, which would hardly be to the purpose, no other torture quite persuades as much that you are surely about to die.\\"<br /><br />The 20 or so pages describing waterboarding is one of the most horrifying things I have ever read in a mystery and will keep you awake at night. Was Kerr making a political point here about events in recent American history? Probably. But facts are facts. The Japanese used this particular \\"interrogation technique\\" against captured U.S. soldiers in World War II and were convicted and hung after the war as war criminals because of it.<br /><br />PRAGUE FATALE is a well-written and engaging mystery, a story all the more horrible because this was happening in 1941 as a once-civilized nation embraced the darkness and descended into total madness. Heydrich issues the infamous order that all Jews must wear yellow stars to identify themselves in the fall of that year. Yet no \\"good\\" Germans offer any resistance. Fear rules. And when old ladies who lived peacefully in the neighborhood for decades suddenly disappear and are sent east to be slaughtered, the rationale of the \\"good\\" neighbors is that they will be happier there \\"with their own kind.\\" The story is equally disturbing because it forces readers to ask some tough questions about the means vs. the ends practiced in our own recent history, also a time of rampant fear.<br /><br />If you have not read any of the previous Bernie Gunther mysteries, this is a fine place to start.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tom Callahan on May 25, 2012

I just finished book 3 and I was not disappointed. Please keep reading. This is a very good story. If you don't like all the sex, skip the pages.  Yes there has to be all the sex because that is what Christain knows.. and if you think about it most new adult relationships are about not being able to keep your hands off each other, that would include sex..  give it a chance and don't get hung up on the sex..

I feel sorry for Lisbeth cause at the end she wanted to meet with Mikael but she saw him with his lady, so she left throwing away a jacket she was gonna give Mikael. The book was way different (the yellow cover with the dragon tattoo book). If you are a fan of Mystery or Crime novels this is the type of book for you, but I recommend to watch the original movie, then the book and finally the new movie, just to see which one of the three was more understandably.:)

B002MQYOFW|4.0|Since the book was written for a young adult audience and I am well beyond that age group, I was not sure if I could enjoy this.  I couldn't flip the pages fast enough, as it turned out.  I assumed since it was a trilogy that the heroine would not die but then again?  I had to read it to be certain.  It was disturbing yet thought provoking.  The post-apocalypse government control and monitoring is not terribly far fetched.  With the current interest in \\"reality\\" TV shows, it seems conceivable under the worse conditions. People are watching people eat bugs or worms, or worse. The author has looked at the darkest side of humanity and said, \\"what if?\\". The Games are not unlike Christians being tossed in with the lions.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I heard about this book through my book club.  Because we are based out of a church, we didn't think it would be an appropriate read for us, but I was intrigued when I heard about it three more times that week.  I decided I would read it.  I must say there were times that I was embarrassed by what I was reading as it is quite graphic, but was intriqued by the characters, especially Christian Grey.  I'm a therapist by trait and I wanted to know more about what happen to him that made him the way he was.  The intrique of trying to figure him out and watching Ana knock down his walls and get to the softer side of him kept me reading.  In fact, I plan to read the entire series as I want to know what happens.
145162445X|5.0|I don't like to read much and I ain't been educated beyond the 8th grade, but I know when something's right. You just feel it in your bone. I know that there's no way that the world is only 6,000 years old because I once read a poster on a bus that advertised a movie called 1.000.000 BC and it had Raquel Welch in it and she was in a very skimpy outfit and it made me realize that no God would make something so beautiful and then deny me from having it for my own.<br /><br />But even after 100+ letters and postcards, Ms. Welch never wrote me back and she even had this tough guy stop by my apartment and tell me to stop bothering Ms. Welch or he was going to throw me down a flight of stairs. Well, I'm one of those folks who don't appreciate being thrown (whether it's stairs or anything).<br /><br />So, I decided to turn my attention to someone I felt was more attainable. And while I didn't find myself physically attracted to Liza, I would just close my eyes and listen to her wonderful voice and I'd be transported to 1,000,000 BC with a woman who looked like Raquel but sung like Liza and had a very open mind and didn't judge me. And the dinosaurs were very friendly too.<br /><br />As to the book, it is one of the best I've ever read.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|Most pop artists are not worth my time to listen to, much less buy their albums. Adele is such a timeless classic talent that 21 is one of the most enjoyable albums I've bought in a long time. If you have not heard several tracks from this album you must have been living under a rock.
0345803485|2.0|The first book was ok because it was different and erotic.  However, the writing is so bad and the story is dull.  By the third book I was skipping over the sex scenes to get to the end.  It also bothered me that there were mispelled words...it's spelled sandals, not sandles.  \\"Holy Cow!\\"  haaha

0060853972|5.0|While most stories about angels, demons, Satan and God are overly preachy to the audience, and most stories about the supernatural star human leads, usually finding out he or she has supernatural abilities or are two brothers who hunt the supernatural for a living(bonus points if you get the TV show I'm referencing.); Good Omens by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett does the exact opposite of those things. It ties in religion in a way that it'll shoot over younger readers' heads(in a way of \\"Look, mommy, it's an angel and a demon trying to save the world from the apocalypse!\\" ...I doubt a little kid would say that, but you know what I mean.), and, for once, it tells a story about the supernatural with the supernatural creatures as the two main characters.<br /><br /> In this comedy about the apocalypse, an angel named Aziraphale and a demon named Crowley have been friends(more or less) and living on earth since `The Beginning'. Meanwhile, somewhere in England, the antichrist(later to be named Adam Young), is born. God catches word of this and assigns Aziraphale and Crowley to misplace the antichrist, so that the apocalypse starts a bit late. While on this adventure to stop the apocalypse, Aziraphale and Crowley realize that they actually like earth more than they thought they did.<br /><br /> If you've read any other of Neil Gaiman's or Terry Pratchett's books, you'll know how this'll turn out style wise; lovable characters, a story that'll have you laughing until you cry, and authors notes that'll do the same(for instance: \\"All though he did have to get up in 1832 to go to the lavatory.\\" when mentioning Crowley's hibernation through most of the Nineteenth century). Though, religious buffs reading this might cringe at some material used. For instance, in order to contact Satan, Crowley steps inside of his bentley or turns on a turntable and puts in a record or tape recording of Queen songs. But that's not to say Good Omens is making fun of religion. In fact, far from it. It just twists and turns it into a way that won't be too preachy to its audience. And then there's the fact of the supernatural being used. It's no Winchester brothers adventure, but it's still there. With witches and angels and demons(oh my!), the average fantasy fan's excitement level will explode. There's a lot of characters to look over, though, and it jumps from plot to plot, sometimes requiring a re-read, but all of this is necessary for the ending. Trust me.  For a little background on the authors, Neil Gaiman wrote mainly graphic novels and short stories, so the world of novels must have been new for him. His resume of books include The Sandman, Coraline, Stardust, American Gods, and The Graveyard Book; but those are some of his more famous works. As for Terry Pratchett, his works include the Discworld series, The Carpet People, The Dark Side of the Sun, Strata, the Johnny Maxwell trilogy, and the list can go on. If I try to connect their other books to Good Omens, I'd be here all night and day.<br /><br /> Let's end this review before I get too carried away with myself. Good Omens is a mesh of supernatural creatures and religious activity that is also a great laugh-out-loud experience. With lovable characters, and a plot that will make you keep flipping the pages without stopping, I'm giving Good Omens by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett a 10 out of 10 stars.
0545265355|1.0|** SPOILER **<br /><br />I didn't like the books at all.  There were such rave reviews that I thought it would be a set worth reading.. it definetly is not.  As I read the books, all I could think of is those real children in countries which actually do use children as animals to be hunted and killed by others-for sport.<br />The books were so boring. I could easily know the next move, continually.  I was far too bored of the books so I thought I would see the movie... that was another snooze fest.<br />If you aren't into teen movies, or you have half a brain to figure out what's next.. save your money and pass this up.

0345803485|2.0|This book received a lot of attention from the media, and after one of my best friends recommended I read it, I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />I'm happy I read it so I can be aware of what the fuss is about. However, I do not understand the hype that surrounds this book. I didn't love it, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, unless they want to read it to be able to discuss their opinions with everyone else who is talking about it.<br /><br />THE PROS:<br /><br />- I liked the beginning of the story: up until about 60% of the way through, I wanted to know what was going to happen next.<br /><br />- The ending. I'm extremely happy with Ana's decision at the end. It was 100% the right decision, since she was in an abusive relationship and unhappy (even though her happy moments with Christian made her mistakenly believe she was happy, I do not think she was.)<br /><br />- Katherine and Elliott's relationship. I wish I saw more of them.<br /><br />THE CONS:<br /><br />- My #1 issue with this book is that so many women are going around declaring Christian Grey their \\"dream man.\\" WHY would anyone admire him?! He is crazy, abusive, disrespectful of women, a control freak, and a stalker! NONE of those traits sound appealing to me. Also, throughout the book I wasn't even given enough information about his past to sympathize with him. I flat-out didn't like him.<br /><br />- This story began as a Twilight fan-fiction, with Ana as Bella and Christian as Edward. In Twilight, the reason Edward is attracted to Bella even though Bella is average is because she is the one person whose mind he cannot read. This makes her extremely different from everyone else, and allowed me to believe their relationship. There was no reason given to me throughout 50 Shades why Christian would be interested in Ana, and I never believed their relationship.<br /><br />- The length. This book was way too long, and needed more editing to par it down. When I reached the 70% point, I was ready for the book to end. It dragged on much longer than necessary.<br /><br />- I wanted to strangle the \\"inner goddess.\\" Did she really have to be mentioned so many times? Along with the subconscious, at points it sounded like Ana had multiple personality disorder.<br /><br />IN CONCLUSION:<br /><br />I do not recommend this book, unless you are curious about the hype and want to be able to discuss it with others. There are so many other great books out there to read. This book glamorizes abusive relationships, and I did not support the \\"romance\\" in it one bit.the book to end.

1594200823|5.0|This is a great book, which tells the contemporary reader a lot of things that we should know, but really don't- namely, where our food comes from, and what it is.<br /><br />Sounds basic, but there you go. The Omnivore's Dilemma explains why we don't generally know those details, and then proceeds to explain why we're all made out of corn. Further options are then presented.<br /><br />This book arrived in great condition- I'd have thought it was completely new, if not for the bottom right corner of the front cover- I think something nibbled on it or something. Odd, but inconsequential. The dustjacket was fine and intact, with a few creased edges, but nothing too bad.<br /><br />Overall a worthwhile purchase, which will have you ranting about how we're all corn for about a week (or more!), and them promptly alarm you into disliking the institution of processed foods and knowing you can do very little about it.<br /><br />~Ace, out.

0307352145|5.0|I received this complimentary copy of Quiet from Crown Publishing (affiliated with WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing) in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />  Maybe you have been called quiet, geeky, bookish, shy, reserved or even snobby. There is a chance you have as estimates have it that one-third to one-half of the population is introverted. Given the American people are an extremely extroverted group, many introverts are ousted to be shy or any of the other aforementioned labels. Thanks be to Susan Cain, the author of this wonderful book Quiet:The Power of Introverts in World That Can't Stop Talking, you can now gain a deeper appreciation for all of the workings inside introverted heads.<br /><br />  Cain leads the reader on a journey back in time when introversion was seen as polite and dignified and then brings us into the present age of a very gregarious culture. The first part of Quiet will hold your attention as I found it to be chock-full of information and touches of humor. Is it not fascinating to muse that historically my reservation, or yours for that matter, would be regarded in high esteem?<br /><br />  Then, in the subsequent chapters, Cain delves into the physiological makeup of introversion and explores what makes introverts tick. Introverts do indeed process the outer world around them at a much different pace and way. There is actual physiological evidence for being thin-skinned (validation for this introvert). She explores a myriad of hypotheses and theories, actually interviewing  many of the leading researchers of the noted studies. I must say the research Mrs. Cain put into this project herself is astounding, impeccable really. This book is the accumulation of years of work and passion.<br /><br />  Part Three, also known as Chapter 8, explores the concept of \\"soft power\\" and the Asian-American experience. I was rather taken by this chapter page by page. The final part of Quiet looks into the practical application of the astounding research. She addresses topics such as: When should introverts act like extroverts? and How can we parent quiet children in the loud din of the world?<br /><br />  Susan Cain penned Quiet experientially using her own career as a corporate lawyer as her jumping off point. She found herself surrounded by loud-mouthed, fast-talking lawyers and executives wondering how she could cultivate her introversion to gain the upper hand in situations. This experience has been filtered down to the reader in a cohesive book. I appreciated that she allowed room for the various nuances each introvert possesses to be addressed. Not every introvert is shy. Not every introvert loves to read. Introversion may fuel us, but in no way can it peg us perfectly.<br /><br />  My only warning is to know Quiet is a book to explore for yourself and the business talk may steer some wrong. However, I would hate to think that a potential reader would not pick this book for that very reason. The wealth of information and validation will outweigh beyond measure any hindrances you may possess.  Although we may live in an extroverted culture, maybe to a fault, being quiet can actually be perceived as a gift to yourself and the world around you. If I have learned nothing else, it is okay to be Quiet.

B004QK5N5W|4.0|I bought this for my mother-in-law for Mother's Day for her Ipad 1st generation. She travels alot and always packs multiple devices to watch movies on TV's on the go and internet access and what not. She has a huge 17\\" laptop with a HDMI port so that heavy thing gets lugged around. I thought this would be perfect. Well it wasn't, atleast not right away. Her Ipad has the newest firmware update 5.1.1. When first plugging in, the screen on the HDTV lets you know its getting signal but only stays black. No mirroring of the ipad whatsoever. If you launch the Netflix app, then it appears on the screen, in full screen to watch Netflix. This was the only thing that I would come on screen for me. Hulu the audio came through but no video. That's it. So I did some research, jailbroke the ipad and installed a app called DisplayOut. Once this was installed, everything on the ipad was immediately mirrored on the screen. So this adapter works really good after the jailbreak but not before. This could be different if you have a ipad 2nd or 3rd generation, I dont know. But if you have a 1st generation ipad, you must jailbreak and buy the $3 app for it to work properly. This is my experience. I have 15+ years of computer and electronic repair experience, so I know what I am doing.

006197806X|2.0|This was going to be a three star review - mostly because the constant jump from the \\"now\\" chapters to the \\"then\\" ones. The only effect that served was to pull me out of the story. Even with that, it was a good book. Not great, not spectacular. It was good. Lena's journey with the other Invalids and the hardships they endured (especially Blue's death) touched me, I seriously hate Raven on a lot of levels, and I want to know more about Lena's mom. TBH, at this point, the mystery about her mother is what will probably have me buying the third book.<br /><br />It took me a while to start this one after it was released. The end of Delirium, and Alex's death, wrecked me for a few days. I couldn't believe after everything....that he'd died. When I did start the book, I kept hoping that I'd read it wrong, or Lena had misinterpreted, etc. But no. Hammered home again and again that Alex was dead.<br /><br />Then she got trapped with Julian. And she started making comparisons in her head, and once she said that she was \\"more comfortable with Julian than Alex\\" and the pit of dread formed in my stomach. I knew then that the author was going to get Lena in love and happy with Julian and bring Alex back. I knew it so much that when he finally turns up, all I did was groan.<br /><br />So the book's rating went down a star for the blatant emotional manipulation - both for us and for Lena. Was she supposed to pine forever because maybe he was alive? She mourned, and she moved on....something every psychiatrist in the world would tell you is normal and healthy. And what happens? Surprise! I'm alive! Now I get to mess up your life because you weren't psychic.<br /><br />Meh. Maybe I'm just over the whole triangle and Team X or Team Y thing.
0375869026|5.0|I picked up WONDER despite the fact that it had two big strikes against it: I usually don't like \\"issue books,\\" and I'm pretty iffy on children's books.  But it won me over completely and I was surprised to find myself reading late into the night, unable to put it down.  It's got that extra special something that makes it more than the sum of its parts, and better than any description.<br /><br />The book is about Auggie Pullman's first year at a regular school, in the fifth grade.  The catch?  Auggie is a smart, sweet 10-year-old born with a genetic anomaly that did a number on his face.  He's undergone surgeries at a rate of several a year ever since he was born, surgeries that keep him alive and functioning but haven't done much to enhance his appearance.  People do a double take when they look at him, other kids don't want to be friends with him, and he's a target for bullies.<br /><br />If the book had just been about fifth grade from Auggie's point of view, I'd have enjoyed it but I don't think I'd have given it five stars.  Especially at first, I was thinking that WONDER is a good book but really just for kids, no crossover appeal, nothing there just for the parents who read along or whatnot.  The chapters are all super short, two or three pages.  The language is pretty simple, and while the ideas were good, they were simple and straightforward, too.<br /><br />And then I got to the part where Palacio started hopping between different points of view, and my own perspective changed.  We get sections narrated by Auggie's sister, Olivia, sections narrated by his friends, a couple of the sister's friends.  And the text starts leapfrogging ahead, with the narrators retelling events we're already familiar with before nudging forward into the future.  And between these multiple narrators, we always go back to Auggie, so he still holds center stage.<br /><br />All of the narrators react to Auggie in different ways; Olivia's first line is: \\"August is the Sun.  Me and Mom and Dad are planets orbiting the Sun.\\"  She's a good kid and loving sister despite the fact that she's always starving for attention, and while Auggie is starting fifth grade she's in her first year of high school.  She wants a chance to start fresh, to not be defined by the existence of her brother, but she also feels ashamed of wanting to hide him.  All of the narrators have little conflicts like that, conflicts that put a spin on who Auggie is and what it means to be a part of his life.<br /><br />I have a couple of quibbles - I thought too many of Auggie's conversations with other kids involved him putting them at ease by making fun of himself.  It was a tactic he used, and it showed his good humor, but proportionally it just struck me as a little much.  I also thought the ending was a little sappy.  For the most part, though, I was surprised to be won over by a book so far out of my usual comfort zone, and extra points for the Magnetic Fields sing-a-long at the end - there is some stuff in the book just for oldsters!Mom and Dad are planets orbiting the Sun.\\"  She's a good kid and loving sister despite the fact that she's always starving for attention, and while Auggie is starting fifth grade she's in her first year of high school.

1609611543|5.0|Dr Davis gives a great overview on his opinion on why we are so sick in todays world.  We all know something is wrong, almost everyone over the age of 40 has some kind of health problem, and it's problems that didn't seem to bother our grandparents or (if you're young enough) our great-grandparents.  Dr Davis basically states that crossbreeding and genetic manipulation of the wheat has caused small changes within the plant that are adversely affecting all of us today.  His plan is simple:  Eliminate all wheat products from your diet.  He explains why this will work, and how your health and well being can be renewed by doing this.  And I do believe that what he says is all true.<br /><br />His book is very technical, and I actually skipped parts of it because it was just too scientifically detailed for me.  Its fine to tell me the wheat had been modified, but describing the chemical breakdown, complete with scientific names, put me to sleep.  The book also seems to be written more as an informational book on how this problem with our health developed, but there's not much on ways to fix the problem.  For example, he tells you that wheat is in many products in the stores...for example, salad dressings.  But when I looked at the ingredient list on my bottles of dressings, I couldn't find anything that indicated wheat was in the mix.  If wheat is added as an ingredient under other names, I'd like to know what they are (he does give a few names, but apparently not all the names).  He also mentioned that you should email or call companies to find out if wheat is used in their products.  I emailed Quaker Oats, Starbucks, and Mayfield Ice Cream.  Only Quater Oats told be that my product was wheat and gluten free.  Starbucks and Mayfield told me that they couldn't tell me if wheat was in their products or not.  I realize that Dr Davis isn't responsible for these companies responses, but I wonder if he even tried that advice before he wrote it.<br /><br />Last, I did go on atotally wheat-free diet--for 10 whole days.  Yeah, I know, I'm weak-willed. But, in just those ten days, I did seem to have a lot less body aches and pains.  I do believe I would have seen more improvement if I had stayed on the diet longer.  But keep in mind that you practically have to cook every single meal from scratch as all processed, prepackaged, and fast food products have wheat products in one form or another.  Its a huge pain trying to keep enough food cooked all the time.  Overall, I believe that Dr Davis is right in everything he says, but he would greatly benefit his readers if he would write a detailed book concerning the 'diet' part of this book...and how to live it day to day.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Mockingjay is a great way to end the Hunger Games Series.  I think the fist book was the best but Mockingjay is a great conclusion with just enough twists to keep you wondering what will happen next.

0312330537|5.0|The first line of this over nine hundred page book drew me in, and I could not put it down after.  I have read that the author took years to write this book, and I believe it, because the word choice is exquisite.  This book is not only beautifully written, it is also incredible the way that the author uses the English language to describe subtle feelings and ideas, that are so difficult to articulate. There are so many different characters, and yet they are so rich and real that I wish I could spend more time with them.  Even the most flawed characters have something to teach, and even the most noble characters have something to learn.  I wish there was another book by this author, although I am not sure how it could top this one.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for this app on android for ever! Really fun and addictive! My friends and I  absolutely love this game!
0345803485|1.0|The display at Barnes and Noble touted this book as, \\"The book everyone is talking about.\\" It would have been better labeled, \\"The book that everyone is reading to see if it is as awful as everyone says it is.\\" The real world of BDSM is much more honest, more intense, more gritty, and more intimate that portrayed here, but the story doesn't really work as a romance because the characters are not compelling enough that one wants to see them live happily ever after. Actually, I am not sure there really is a story. For the lack of plot and the shallowness of the characters, I can see why it is being referred to by some as pornography, but it isn't graphic or raw enough to really deserve that title, either. The sex is unrealistic, tame, and devoid of real emotion. The words used are mundane and extremely repetetive. At least I can say that the book taught me one valuable lesson: one must always at least skim the book before purchasing it.

1423101502|4.0|Blasted into a world of centaurs, minotaurs, satyrs, and man eating cyclops striving for greatness against evil greek gods, even when all odds are against them. Did I also mention they have the help of a few amazing demigods? In my opinion I absolutely loved Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Last Olympian. It was interesting, informative and it even taught me different things about greek mythology along the way. I always wanted to keep reading and it even got me into trouble one time, but what can I say I was an addict to Rick Riordan's series. To me the book was like a drug and I was hooked and wanted more and more all the time.<br />  Percy Jackson a son of Poseidon and his two best friends Grover a teenage Satyr, and Annabeth a daughter of Athena are put up against evil gods from Tartarus that have been trying to kill them for years. The story starts off with Percy and the crew on a cruise ship trying to find the Titan gods. A plummeting fall to the ocean after the boat explodes, knocks him unconscious and sinking to the bottom of the ocean. Several hours later he winds up in his father's kingdom under the sea with his cyclops brother Tyson. After his long talk with his dad he returns to Camp Half Blood in hope that his friends escaped the boat explosion. He discovered that all of his friends were alive and well except for one brave soul named Beckendorf who sacrificed his life to save the others.Percy figured it would be proper to have ceremony in honor of his friend and  great demigod. Soon after the ceremony ended he was told his final prophecy by the Oracle: \\"A half-blood of the eldest gods, shall reach sixteen against all odds, and see the world in endless sleep, the hero's soul, cursed blade shall reap, a single choice shall end his days, olympus to preserve or raze.\\" At first percy wasn't sure what this could mean, until all these crazy ideas rushed into his head at once. Is he gonna die, will it be from a sword, what single choice will end his days? Hewas nervous and confused.<br />  As Percy and his friends traveled through New York City, New York they come across a mortal girl who could see through the mist. She is very helpful to them because she knows Percys fate and how it will affect him. She informs them that the Titan Gods are creating a monster it can destroy them all unless a son or daughter of Ares destroys it. This send sends the group of crazy teens into a mad rampaging quest to find the chosen demigod. The group also knows that one demigod can't destroy a whole Titan army so they also set out in search of gods and demigods who will fight for their side. This is a struggle for them because the Titans have such manipulation over people. With the fact that they have many demigods fighting for them, it leaves Percy and his friends short people. In a last final stretch Percy finds people to fight with him. Kronos king of the Titans doesn't feel this is a threat to him so he persists in getting his army ready for battle. After hours of preparing the two sides finally go to battle in Manhattan. To protect the humans around them they freeze time, leaving the people the demigods travel up through the Empire State building in a last effort to speak with the gods. They finally get through to them, they have the gods of Olympus on their side. Driving the Titans up and the down the city blocks in war the Gods of Olympus and the demigods prevail to win. They are granted with gifts from the gods and special roles throughout the world. Percy and his friends head back to camp and discover a few damages, they knew it was repairable and just relaxed. The group finds out later that night that the mortal girl Rachel is their new Oracle.<br />  I would rate this book a 4 out of 5 stars because of such detail and excitement throughout the book. Reading this book reminded me of watching a scary movie at the theaters, where you're sitting on the edge of your seat waiting for something to happen next. I was always hooked and never lost interest which I thought was a big because sometimes a story can get rambling on about a topic in the story and you just sit there drooling waiting for it to end. Exhilarating and enjoyable are only a few words I would use to describe such a an incredible ending to such a great series by Rick Riordan.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is pretty ba. it makes 'merica proud its an awesome game. enough said im just trying to reach the word minimum

B005S9EJ14|5.0|The story focuses on a varied group British senior citizens who all find themselves feeling useless and wondering, \\"Is there more to life?\\"  They each decide they need a complete change of pace and move to India to live in a fabulous retirement hotel, which, of course, turns out to be not at all fabulous.  They adjust to the very different Indian culture to varying degrees; some find what they were looking for, others not so much.<br /><br />The outstanding ensemble cast is headed by Judi Dench as a recent widow who finds a job at a call center.  She's quite<br />likable and a pleasure to watch. Tom Wilkinson plays a man who was in love in India decades ago and hopes to reconnect. Maggie Smith is fun as an acerbic woman who goes to India for surgery even though she hates Indians and Bill Nighy plays a henpecked husband who longs for happiness.<br /><br />I absolutely loved this movie; the characters were sympathetic and real and I cared about each of them.  Their storylines were believable and entertaining and I was left with a smile on my face. I think it would especially appeal to people of a certain age who may find themselves at loose ends. The movie will certainly make you examine your own life and perhaps convince you to try a very different, if initially frightening, path to fulfillment.
B0080YGZ20|5.0|I must say Kimbra's Vows album for the US is by far one of the best I've heard in years.  I once told her on SoundCloud after hearing a few of her songs there, that it gives me goosebumps listening to it, but goosebumps is an understatement, more like \\"mountains on my skin\\" to quote one of her older songs! There are six new songs on this album that were not released on her New Zealand/Australian versions of Vows and they are just as good in Kimbra fashion. My favorites of this album which I purchased on cd, is Good Intent, Plain Gold Ring (Live), Something In The Way You Are, Posse and The Build Up! I can listen to these songs over and over. As a musician myself, I would be in heaven and totally honored to play with such a talented lady! I highly recommend purchasing all of her releases of Vows, as I have, because they are all somewhat different.  Everything I hear her sing raises \\"Mountains On My Skin.\\" It's how I know it's good stuff when I feel that! Kimbra is absolutely an incredible talent. I buy her cd's so I can hold it in my hand...I guess I am old fashioned this way, sorry Warner Music Group Green, I have to have the disc. :-) Buy it, and keep this hard working young lady on the airwaves, you won't ever regret it! Sorry Amazon I purchased this through another vendor recommended by Kimbra. If you are lucky enough to find the Limited Edition version with the Sing, Sing DVD, buy it! It's pricey but totally worth it.  An incredible, albeit short, little production but the quality of which is beyond compare! [[ASIN:B005GUQJ9A Vows (Ltd ed)]]
B000KFTWIG|4.0|Love this album.  Still holds up in todays hip hop world.  Biggie didn't make that many albums so why not have this one.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|Over all I definitely liked this book and would recommend it to must people to read.  I preferred it to most legendary-style books because it was interesting to just learn about this guy's life.  I didn't want another fantasy book where there is some bad guy trying to kill everyone and how some hero overcomes his challenges to save the world.  Although I have a feeling that eventually this series will turn into that type of book, it at least starts off just being about a guy and some of the amazing things he did in his life.<br /><br />That being said there are some major flaws that might drive you nuts about this book.  Let me start off with the most annoying of them: the storytelling aspect.  Just when you are really getting engrossed in the story, the author feels the need to rip you back to the \\"present\\" and have nothing happen as he serves the local population dinner or something trivial and completely and utterly mind-boggling boring.  I for the life of me can't understand why he feels the constant need to ruin this amazing story with this crap.  Second, any time the main character is describing anything to do with music, he just goes overboard.  Everything is way over the top and it gets a little old after a while.<br /><br />For the most part though I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  If you can just skim through some of the annoying crap then it is well worth the read.  If on the other hand you get caught up in the details like many of the other reviewers, then this book is not for you.  It really depends on if you are a forgiving reader or not for whether you will enjoy this book.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game ive been waiting so long for this app to come on the amazon app store on the kindle fire! it is so cool and addictive and fun!! its super awesome if you have a fire you should have this app!! ( now kindle just has to come out with jet pack joy ride and pocket God)
B007J4T2G8|2.0|From the general consensus of the reiews, I won't purchase this trilogy.  I felt the same about the twilight series.  Although I know the outcome, well into the second book I quit, as I too felt like it was written by and for teenagers...a big time saving \\"thank you\\" to all reviewers...
B00005UT84|4.0|This is a superb set and for anyone who enjoys prog-rock you will love the musicianship and energy of this set. The recording is also excellent given it was 1974. But, but, the vocals are weak and poor. Oh why did this band never, ever, get themselves a decent vocalist? Like Camel, another marvelous band from this era who also suffered from the same weakness. I still recommend this album for the brilliant instrumental passages and if you like Camel you will like this.
B007Z9QS5K|1.0|The title of this review says it all! Hahaha! Wow! What a complete waste of time and money and I usually love these kind of movies!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this app on multiple platforms, and I love how they play well with one another. It is great if you use multiple devices.
B00723NWJE|3.0|We like Norah Jones but her latest albums are not as good as her first three albums.  The music is too loud for her singing.
B0086700CM|4.0|it's very fun and challenging. never boring. I like to see how far I can get each time I play.
B0086700CM|5.0|finally with no lag either. Just dont buy the background pics for coins because they dont show up. best game EVER!!!
B000WC39SG|5.0|Excellent film highlighting airborne operations during World War II and some of the coordinating and politics of a military operation of this magnitude.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This was a new game experience for me; I've never played a nonogram game before.  If you enjoy logic puzzles like Sudoku or Kakuro you will love this one.  Fun and challenging concept, app is flawless, graphics are tastefully understated and excellent, no bizarre permissions or OpenFeint... it's pretty dang near perfect.  The only Con that comes to mind is that it's challenging to play on a phone screen due to size constraints, but zooming and scrolling are easy.  I think this game would be amazing on a tablet.
0345803485|2.0|I must say, in spite of the reviews warning of a thin plot and even thinner vocabulary, I couldn't resist a good, old fashioned \\"bodice-ripper\\" for light summer reading. However, this book is so poorly written it just irritated me to no end. Really, I've read Letters to Penthouse with better grammar and more creative wording than \\"Fifty Shades\\". Come to find out, it was originally self-published in ebook format. No wonder. I am sure the writer would have been laughed out of every major publishing house.<br />The writing aside, even the sex scenes were dull. Kinky, yes, but altogether not exciting. The big dealbreaker for me was that the male lead character began stalking the female lead, and it was written in such a way that it was intended to seem romantic. It as not. It was flat out creepy. All in all, I would not recommend this book to anyone, ever.
B005WM7D0G|5.0|The Ancient wisdom of the Toltec as retold by Miguel Ruiz is an excellent way to lose your old tapes about who you are and become your authentic self.  Highly recommend!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book that will keep you into it the whole series. It is a Dirty book but with a story to it!!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game was used a lot on my ipod for a while... it got boring for a whileband hadn't used it for a while. Now with this game being on my kindle its awesome! The larger screen makes ne want to playbit even more! its not sluggish and jittery like the iphone/ipod version. The amazon app store got it right with this one.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I can't put it down! And now my daughter won't have to download a new game every 5 min when she gets bored!

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I've had these headphones for close to ten years and still love them as much as first day I used them. 10 years later, they've got a lot of ware and tear on them because frankly I've abused them, but no structural damage or rips. They have held up amazingly for what I've put them through. I did have to replace the pads recently because they started to tear. I had the newer version of Sony pro headphones, didn't like them, returned them and went back to these. I do a lot of audio editing for video and use these to find the small details you would miss on other setups. These headphones are very detailed and accurate (of course don't try to mix in them, or any headphones for that matter). I find that they are very even across all frequencies. They are very comfortable to wear also, I've worn them for 10+ hours at a time with no problems. Note that, since these are so precise and accurate, poor music recordings show. If your music library is in mp3 and you like a lot of muddy bass than these are probably not for you.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|I love it. I saw this movie around 15 times and the DVD looks like new. I like to buy movies or series in amazon becaseu all of them (DVD's) are working property
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am not normally a big Stephen king fan. But I like certain time travel stories. Mr king did a marvelous job of weaving the true history of 1958 through 1963 with his fiction. I have studied and read the history of the Kennedy assassination and lee Harvey Oswald extensively and I was skeptical that the story would not be believable, however I found thr story fascinating and engrossing and could not  put it down.  I higher recommend it.
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|I bought this movie because it was a mother's gift and the quality is very good. I know that this DVD is not a blue ray but 4 me is acceptable and played several times this movie and it looks like new
B007SO31BQ|5.0|This is the perfect documentary for everyone. I've had the privilege in seeing this film about 5 times already, and it never gets old. It tells the story of the fearless Formula One Racing Driver Ayrton Senna, and his story off the track. To show us what an incredible human being he truly was. This film is about passion, determination, fearlessness, integrity, and tragedy, and it is told so beautifully that you cannot look away. You will be on the edge of your seat as Senna takes turns at amazing speeds, and overtakes other racing drivers, and you will be brought to tears when you see how much heart he had, and how much he loved his country and all the children of Brazil. This is the story of an amazing human being.
0345803485|4.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is a book meant for mature readers only.<br /><br />Let me start by telling you what it is not. My first introduction to this book had me believing that it was the next Twilight type book. WRONG! I do not understand where people are getting that idea. Yes, E.L. James admitted to being a Twilight fan. So what. That doesn't mean that her book is like Twilight. There are no vampires or werewolves. The only similarity that I see is the fact that Christian warns Ana to stay away from him because he is no good for her.<br /><br />I've also heard this book referred to as Mommy porn. People are absurd! Anybody who has ever watched porn knows that porn has No plot. Just because a book has sex in it does not make it porn.<br /><br />I found this book to be intriguing. Yes there was a lot of sex in this book, some of which made me uncomfortable. The sex and the circumstances are needed to help us understand Christian Grey. He is one of the main characters and if you read the books, they show how messed up he is and eventually we find out why he is the way he is. I could not put the book down. I couldn't wait to find out what happened between him and Ana.<br /><br />I feel that this was an interesting story about a man who had a poor start to life and then was very misguided by someone he looked up to.  There is so much story in this book that I don't understand the people who are putting this book down and calling it porn. Did they read the same book that I did?<br /><br />The main focus of the book is Christian, Ana and their complicated relationship. The characters are very believable. I loved her writing style, It was as though I was going through the emotions with Ana.<br /><br />The plot is full of complex characters, sex, and romance. The characters have real issues to work through and they don't just meet and fall immediately in love like so many other characters do. It's refreshing!
B000V6I7WG|5.0|This is one of the best movies that I have EVER seen. 12 hours after viewing and I cannot get the entire film out of my head. The film follows Dae-su (Min-sik Choi) as he gets abducted and trapped inside a hotel/jail for 15 years without an explanation and while he is in there he learns that he is framed for his wife's murder. One day he is released with no explanation and then is left to put the pieces together. He befriends a young woman name Mi-do and she helps him through thick and thin to find the answers. Do yourself a favor and watch this NOW! This film has one of the best twists I've ever seen, and it had me yelling at the end. Which I couldn't believe because I thought I had seen and figured out everything. This film is truly a treat to the mind and the eyes.
B0086700CM|5.0|I haven't put it down since I downloaded it!!! its not hard to earn coins to upgrade. I recomend for sure!!!!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|sooooooooooooooo much fun, lots of ways to customize attacks and kill zombies, because zombies are bad. graphics run good on kindle fire. totally impressive for free game
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The following comment is from my original review in 2012:  I find the temperture reports more accurate on this app But, BUT it is not uncommon for the radar map to lag hours behind. This is a definate problem when there are storms in the area.    UPDATE: 2015   I use, or try to use, the App on a daily basis. From time to time it's had minor glitches but recently something has changed (update??) and now I lose all my saved locations on (what seems to be) a weekly basis. This is most annoying. I have reported it through feedback on the APP, through their link for \\"having a problem.\\" I've even recieved an email from them asking if I'd participate in helping them improve the app. In fact I've recieved this email twice. I responded yes, but have yet to hear back from them. I would love to give this app a great rating but I can't. The \\"glitch\\" of losing the locations is a deal breaker for me.
B007AJFSJW|4.0|If you've been reading Krugman's articles in the NYT, there's very little new here. The value is that it's all in one place, easy to look up and refer to, especially if you're using an eBook version like Kindle. That's why I bought a copy, rather than borrowing one from my local library, my usual practice.
B003ITF6H2|2.0|I hate being missed in my review, but contrary to what some other people say, this version of Children of the Corn is actually better than the 1984 original.  David Anders is more interesting than the character Peter Horton played in the original -- this time, we get a former Marine from Vietnam instead of the just-graduated emergency room doctor.  The woman who plays Vicky in this movie, instead of Linda Hamilton, is also great.  These two fight constantly and are on the verge of a divorce, which is more interesting than the lovely dovey couple that Horton and Hamilton played back in 1984.<br /><br />But, they are the only two who are better actors than in the original. The child actors in this are awful, especially the one playing Isaac.  He is so bad that at times I felt like I was watching a grade school parents' night play.  Just awful.<br /><br />I also miss the two good kids from the original -- Job and Sarah.  Without them, the town's just full of evil, crazy kids and the movie's less interesting.<br /><br />I also miss the weird old guy who ran the filling station in the original movie...he was not in this one.<br /><br />I read the original Stephen King short story and this adaptation does better reflect the plot of that story...but it's missing the best parts of the 1984 movie.<br /><br />I actually started this review giving the movie a 3...but as I wrote this, I have been thinking on that and realize it's at best a 2-star in terms of ratings.<br /><br />A movie like this is really a success based on who plays the Isaac character...the leader of the kids.  The first movie worked because the kid cast as Isaac was the right blend of menacing and creepy.  The one in this new version failed because its Isaac was just a terrible actor.  I swear, he must have been the producer's nephew or something because I can't imagine they auditioned more than one kid and decided HE was the best one.
145162445X|5.0|In \\"A Universe from Nothing\\" Dr. Lawrence Krauss, with his customary wit and clarity takes on the ultimate question and accomplishes three important goals:<br /> 1. Redefining out traditional view of `nothing'<br /> 2. Explaining the froth of virtual activity in what we thought of as the void, and<br />3. Perhaps most importantly, closing the final gap, and eliminating the need for a mythic supernatural Creator of the universe.<br />Dr. Krauss shows that there is not, and cannot be, what we have until now thought of as `empty space. We have learned that in interstellar space, or even perhaps the vacuum we create in a bell jar in a lab, there is approximately one elementary particle per cubic meter, and the remainder of that cubic meter holds nothing at all.<br />Quantum theory now tells us that concept is invalid, and that the remainder of that square meter contains myriads of virtual entities popping into and out of existence in extremely short periods of time.<br />Surprisingly, also, among the entities that can pop into existence from `nothing' are universes, and to our certain knowledge, at least one, which we inhabit, has done so.<br />The importance of this is that it eliminates the need for a `first mover;' particles and universes, under the influence of nothing more than the laws of physics, spring into existence without the need for a `Divine watchmaker'.<br />\\"A Universe from Nothing\\" is an absolute must read for everyone interested in physics, cosmology, and the dichotomy between science and religion.
0345803485|3.0|Ok so this was picked for my somewhat monthly book club and was quite a shock to most of us.  However, I must give the book its due.  It is captivating and I found myself absorbed with the characters.  It is not literary genius but it is a page turner and I usually read mostly non-fiction/historical fiction so this was a huge leap for me.  I do assume this is fiction although to some people it might be their reality.  I considered this book a break from reality which was welcomed.<br /><br />In parts disturbing as character Christian find immense pleasure in \\"dominating\\" his newest muse Anastasia.  I doubt this book would have been as wildly popular if Christian weren't handsome, rich and powerful because flying your own helicopter and staying in the penthouse sure beats fighting traffic and shacking up at the Motel 6.<br /><br />If nothing else it's quite an introduction (for me anyway) to erotic romance and role playing albeit much of the sex scenes are hard to believe.  A fairly high orgasm count in this book for a newly deflowered young lady.  Interestingly enough I do remember working with a Grandmotherly woman who read Harlequin Romance Books during her lunch break at her desk.  Seems a little creepy to me now.<br /><br />Why are women drawn to \\"bad\\" men?  I've seen it happen to the smartest of them as they are hopelessly controlled by a man.  Christian certainly is a control freak and why would a woman put up with it?  See above, handsome, rich and powerful.  Just sadly, captivating.  Thank goodness it's fiction right?
145162445X|5.0|Accessible volume on cutting-edge physics, great read - found it fascinating! Dr. Krauss is gifted at explaining very complicated subjects to laypeople while conveying why the subject is important.
B0064Y5U24|5.0|Great music, great band.  I especially love Where We Stand.  Very touching and thought provoking.  Definitely worth purchasing.  I listen to it every day, some of the more fast tempo songs I train to as well.  This Means War has a great run tempo!!!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I really enjoyed these books. Being that I love reading series that could be a main reason, But they kept my attention that is for sure. The only thing that I could say with a negative twist on it is that to me it could have been alot more....I was expecting a pretty dirty book and got something that was a few steps up from most romance novels. Still I would recommend reading it to anyone I see.
145162445X|5.0|By far one of the best books on the origins of the cosmos. I enjoy Lawrence Krauss's books as much I enjoy Brian Greene's books. Easy to read and a good story that's easy to follow.
B0086700CM|5.0|hey its werdna290 on YouTube twitter and more. its very gun and always will be even though we got it late.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|This is a nice gem for puzzle fans.  Fun to work through them with enough variety to keep you entertained.  Looking forward to Azada 2.
B0086700CM|5.0|I cant believe its in the kindle firing app store at last!!! finally I have been waiting!!!!! its so awesome to have temple run!!!!
0345529057|5.0|Just like the show, but more detailed. The language is especially interesting to read, and allows you to pick up the subtle sarcastic and underlying tone in the dialogue. I highly recommend this series!
0345803485|5.0|This book has turned my wife into a sexual animal. I mean that in a good way. She can't lay it down once she starts and when she does she is chasing me all over the place until she catches me and has her way with me. Greatest book for husbands ever!
B0013N3DSE|5.0|There have been many adaptations of Robin Hood. I have to say this is by far my all time favorite version. I mean don't get me wrong I enjoyed the disney's version, laughed at mel brooks version, and others......yeah won't go into them. However this version I feel truly represents the fun, the adventure, the excitement, and the romance of Robin Hood.<br /><br />This Blu-ray copy is fantastic, I thought it all looked fantastic on screen, the extras were interesting and love that they put Rabbit Hood and Daffy Robin Hood cartoons from that time as well. This film is perfect to introduce kids to the character (yeah disney is alright but show them this one first). Fun for the family, I actually bought this for my date night with my girlfriend and we both sat on the couch and had such joy watching this.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It was quite interesting and a definite page turner. After finishing the first book I quickly purchased the second book, and then of course the third. It's a good read!!
B001AVCFK6|5.0|This movie was excellent for so many reasons. It takes the original Star Trek universe and changes its history thus creating a whole new dimension for the characters to exist in. If your a Star Trek fan then you want to see and own this movie.<br /><br />Can't wait to see what they do in the next ST... will they base it on \\"Wrath of Khan\\"? I sure hope so!!!
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|Love this albummmm.... So amazing it's just perfect love love love!!!. Great Songs it's everything it says it will be in the discription
0689835604|5.0|My almost 10 month old loves this book! He lights up when I reach for it and sits in my lap while we read the entire book. (Which is saying alot for this busy boy!) The illustrations are vibrant. This is the first board book that he'd rather read than chew. Love it!
B006R1T40I|4.0|So good to have a new collection from Bonnie Raitt. Lives up to her usual standards. For me the ballads are best, stick with you longest, but there's not a loser in the bunch.
B0086700CM|5.0|now ive played many games on my kindle before. but this is by far the most adicting. i litterally cant even put my tablet down! i would tell you not to play this game but that would just be sinfull.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This film was so moving for me and my wife that we had to purchase additional copies to share with our Pastor, Deacon, and all of our employees at one of our companies.  I truly feel this movie is a must see for any Dad and any future father.
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm so excited and happy that I actually have Temple Run on my Kindle Fire!!! Thanks!!! I will play this game every day!! Its an awesome game!!!
B007JWKLP6|3.0|This was a perfectly decent documentary.  There was a lot of footage that I had never seen, which was really cool.  I also really appreciated the candid interviews with his son, Eric Clapton and Tom Petty.  It was clear that the few people that were close to George loved him very much.  The special features on the disc are fairly sparse, mostly featuring cut interviews.  It kind of makes you wonder why an additional 2 minute conversation with Paul McCartney would get cut out of a 210 minute film.  Overall I thought it was a bit long and lost it's focus at times, but definitely a must watch for any Beatles fan.
0312370849|3.0|I read this book for my book club.  They generally enjoyed learning about the history involved and the story.  I found it to be a sad book.  Just when things started to  look good, the book ended.  I wouldn't read this book for my own pleasure.  I prefer happier books.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This is a book I would have never picked up on my own but searching for something to read on Amazon I look for referrals based on what other people are reading. I was so pleasantly surprised by this book. What a beautiful story about life, love and meaningfulness. It is touching, thought provoking and real. There were times that I just cried for what the characters were going through, which is something I don't experience often. Although this book is full of depressing subject matter, I found it to be inspirational. A book I couldn't put down and couldn't wait to get back to.<br />It would be interesting to get the perspective of a young person who read this to see if they took away the same things that I took away. As an adult, I found it a great book about the value of being loved and being able to love.
B005DC68NI|5.0|LETS GET DIGITAL is perhaps one of the best researched and written books I have ever had the pleasure to purchase. For the self publisher and especially the Kindle Newbie this is a work of significance.<br /><br />Every aspect of the whole process is methodically covered with special emphasis on the need for professionalism at each stage. I must admit the thought of paying $2000 for professional editing is somewhat scary along with the cost of formatting and beta editing and so on.<br /><br />For the Novelist who is serious about breaking into the mainstream this must be a prerequisite; however if you haven't got this kind of money you are going to have to do the best you can. Everything else in the book is within the scope of every budding Author.<br /><br />As a \\"How To get Going at the Highest level of Professional Authorship\\" book, David Gaughran's manual is unbeatable and the detailed statistics will make you sit up and take notice. It's a long book, crafted by a professional who takes a real pride in his work with the most exemplary writing and information. To say this book is a masterpiece is by no means an exaggeration.<br /><br />David's book is so good, that although I have never bought a piece of fiction in my life, I am intrigued to see how he performs in that Genre.
0241951615|5.0|Aeons ago I was a great pal of Binkie Carstairs, the original of 'Sebastian Flyte' in poor old Evelyn's little novel.  (I understand that this is not what the worthy critics say, but let them have their hour.) Binkie was a man of pungent wit, a happily unrepentant sybarite, a mixer of the best martinis this side of Suez, and a dispenser of priceless bon mots, none of which I can now remember.  Lord alone knows whether - in terms of characterization, dialogue, setting, use of the weather etc - poor Evelyn's novel is really up to the mark. The word 'overrated' is sometimes bandied about.  Of that I am no judge.  But as a ritratto of darling Binkie, 'Brideshead' will always seem to those who really knew him a ghastly travesty.  O tempora, O Binkie!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I have to say I wasn't sure about getting this series when I first heard about it but now I am very glad I did.  Once I started reading these books it was extremely hard to put my kindle down!!
B0086700CM|5.0|it is a really good game but it keeps glitching and lagging plz fix but it is fun to play
B007J4T2G8|1.0|With all the hoopla about this book, I thought it was worth a reading.  What a disappointment - merely a sign of how our culture falls prey to collective hype driven by the media frenzy.  I am angry at the time I wasted and encourage people not to bother.  There are so many better things to do with your time and mental energy.
0385523912|5.0|This was a Book Club selection by one of our members. I was riveted from page one. Ms Demick is a master storyteller, bringing out in me all the emotions I could feel towards a complete stranger in a strange land. I read far too many pages with disbelief and horror, realizing I knew very little about North Korea despite reading about it in the press. So much goes unreported because the country is so closed, the people so isolated. This is dystopian at its best.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it but I wish there would be more to it then run and buy things.<br />best game ever.
006197806X|5.0|Y'all. I didn't expect to love this book as much as I did. I didn't expect to pick it up one lazy afternoon and read-read-read until it was dark and the book was done and I was replete.<br /><br />Of course, I enjoyed Delirium and, with Lauren Oliver's talent for writing, knew I'd be in for a great story with Pandemonium. But this book...it just sucked me in and didn't let go.<br /><br />Lena's all alone, having escaped her prison and left behind her family, friends, and lover. Love. The disease she was warned about embodied in a boy--Alex, the love of her life--who she left struggling in the grips of the regulators and destined for the Tombs or, more likely, death.<br /><br />But she has to move on, to survive. She does, joining with other Invalids who live free in the Wilds. She becomes part of the rebellion. And, though her heart is broken, she meets another boy who resonates, who she connects with. I thought this \\"connection\\" came about too quickly but, because the concepts of love and lust are so foreign to these people, it's viable.<br /><br />And then there was the ending. Yes, a cliffhanger but not unexpected. It is, after all, the middle of the series, and I just knew \\"it\\" would happen. \\"It\\" brought about a small amount of eye-rolling on my part but I still closed the book with a sigh of satisfaction.<br /><br />Brilliant, poetic writing wrapped around an action-packed story encased in the beauty of love.

B0086700CM|5.0|Man this game is on apples app store. Most fun game ever. Cant wait to conquer it. It is finally here. Get your gunning shoes on.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like this game a lot.  the only problem with this app is that you have to pay actual money to get certain items.
B0086700CM|5.0|wow its so fun I cant leave my game alone because it is so fun i love it so much (:
B0086700CM|5.0|Its about time they got temple run on amazon. I have been waiting for this game forever. I side loaded but it didn't work nearly as well.

B0081KTI0E|2.0|I usually Love Daniel Radcliffe, and his movies are always very good, but this one was not on the \\"Good List\\". I was very disappointed with this movie. I tried to make good out of a bad situation, but for me, this was a miss. The movie had a few startling moments, but that was it. I found the story line interesting, but the movie was very boring in my taste.
B0086700CM|5.0|One word: Amazing! its way bigger than the ipod. its super sweet love it!<br /><br />By: Awesomer101<br />Temple Run is BEAST...
0345803485|5.0|THIS WAS AN ABSOLUTELY SUPERB BOOK, ONE THAT I COULDN'T PUT DOWN AND GOT INTO A PANIC HALF WAY THROUGH AND HAD TO ORDER THE NEXT ONE , AND LIKE WISE OF THE NEXT. EXCELLENT BEST READ FOR A WHILE.

0756407125|5.0|When I rated Rothfuss's first book, 'The Name of the Wind', I gave it three stars--because it was a good story, and a good beginning, but it felt like all the good stuff was yet to come. This book delivered that really good bite of story I was looking for. I think it's unfortunate publishers won't put books out that are 3,000-5,000 pages long, because I really, really think Rothfuss's books are meant to be a single book you read all through in one sitting. It shows in how it's written, and reading this book made me like the first book a lot better. The prose and story content matures with Kvothe--where the first novel seemed more naive and child-like/fairytale-ish, this one was a little darker, a little grimmer, and we start to get our first senses of Kvothe as a man instead of a boy. I really enjoyed this book. Moreover, it's the first book I've been able to truly lose myself in in a very long time, which entirely due to the prose, which succeeds in elevating the story without distracting you with stray commas and rampant adverbs.<br /><br />In other words, loved it.
B0086700CM|2.0|does anyone else find it natural to find a game with this many reviews and a full five stars? all the reviews seem like their made by only two people who probably work there....
1401937268|3.0|These cards are beautiful and have great energy, but the problem is they are too big to use. I can't even shuffle them. Doreen Virtue is like 5'9 and I'm sure she has larger than normal hands because of her height but I wish she would consider those of us who are smaller. I'm going to try to cut my deck smaller and see if I can use it then. Unfortunate that I have to do that though!
1892005034|5.0|Marshall Rosenberg gives all of us a gift with his book Nonviolent Communication. I say all because you may unknowingly benefit because someone in your life read it and is following Rosenberg's suggestions. If you find that you are getting along better with a friend, a family member, a colleague or a co-worker it may well be that you are responding to the communication style being taught in this book.<br /><br />But don't wait for someone else to read Nonviolent Communication to clear your relationship problems. Jump in now.  You may have a quick temper or harsh way of speaking that you know about.  You may consider yourself a kind and gentle person and are baffled by problematic relationships.  You may feel resentful because you withhold your feelings and desires to appease and go along with someone else's agenda yet still suffer in negative communications.<br /><br />You may be self critical, harsh and verbally violent in your inner talk to yourself about what you perceive as your shortcomings.  The harshness within yourself about yourself can contribute to your belief that such harshness is normal.  You may not realize that the level of harshness you consider normal expresses itself as violent communications to other people.<br /><br />Rosenberg offers compelling stories and simple steps to communicate to others and yourself in a clearer, empathic, vulnerable and strong way.  He shows you how to move through surface storms and knee jerk reactions to genuine connection and understanding.<br /><br />This is a book that takes on the challenging task of real peacemaking - with others and with yourself.  Making peace does not mean ending a battle. Making peace means creating a climate of communication that allows for differences and honors all parties with respect and understanding.<br /><br />Rosenberg's book is not a solution to all the human created problems in this world, but it's a great contribution.  I recommend it as a helping guide for individuals, families, people in therapy and in recovery work from addictions, for employers and employees.  I think it would be wonderful to teach these practices in schools from kindergarten on up to graduate levels.<br /><br />Rosenberg shows us that it's never too late to fully enrich our lives with the gifts that come with peace and compassion in our relationships and with ourselves.<br /><br />P.S.

B007IXWL2C|3.0|I really enjoyed Fifty Shades of Grey and Fifty Shades Darker and I would have been happier if the story ended there.  I felt like the Fifty Shades Freed went on a little too long and it lost its sex appeal.  Hey we all know this isn't classical english literature.  That's not what I bought it for any way.  My reason for purchasing these three books was for a little guilty pleasure. The relationship dynamic began to become a little boring.  The one thing I did enjoy was the addition of the first chapter rewritten from Christians point of view.

0307719219|3.0|This review is from: Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty (Hardcover)<br />Since January, this book has sat out in the open where I'd pick it up and try again to get into it, and now that June 1 is imminent, I finally skimmed each chapter but never did manage to read every word. Is it because I'm incapable of getting into history or economics? Well, I read every word of \\"Doing Well and Doing Good\\" by Richard John Neuhaus, and every word of John Upton Terrell's Navajo history. I love the economic sections of Richard White's \\"A New History of the American West,\\" not just the Railroad parts, but even talk of \\"the extractive economy.\\" Phrases like that can make my eyes glaze over, but not in White's hands (or fingertips on keyboard). His Chapter 10, The West and The World Economy, held my attention. So, after an inital bout of self-doubt when I tried to read \\"Why Nations Fail,\\" I finally decided the book fails for me, not because I'm too obtuse to grasp economics, but because I've been spoiled by writers who can breathe life into a subject as seemingly dry as economics.<br /><br />Acemoglu and Robinson come very very close to delivering the goods. Every section has a cool title -- Chapter 6 Drifting Apart, e.g., has subtitles that draw me in: How Venice Became a Museum...Roman Virtues (ha ha, there was such a thing?)...Roman Vices--wait a minute, Alaric and the Goths sacking Rome is a Roman vice? No, but Roman elites tried to appease barbarian commanders and failed to save Iberia from the Vandals....a few pages later, Rome's centralized power keeps comman Romans from securing property rights, and civil wars become common, slavery remains a constant in Rome, next page, shipwrecks can be used to track the economic decline of Rome...next page, the Roman state has driven the creation and spread of new tchnologies. Next page, next page, cool section title: \\"No One Writes from Vindolanda,\\" yes, this is still Chapter 6, and Ocatvius is greeting his brother Candidus, and their correspondence illustrates some key things about economic prosperity in...Roman England? Not Rome? Back up one page. Claudius conquered England in AD 43. Next page: by AD 411, the Roman Empire gave up on England. Oh.... what about Germany? I myself saw the Roman ruins of Trier, Germany. Flip to index to see if Germany is in this book. What? No glossary/index? Okay.... Chapter 7, The Turning Point, opens with yet another teaser of a subtitle: Trouble With Stockings. Mmm, a new knitting machine obsesses William Lee in 1583.<br /><br />Perhaps you see what I mean about this book being hard to follow, with elusive arguments and supporting evidence?<br /><br />Interesting, yes, but I know far less about science, yet any Sagan or Dawkins book will hold me spellbound.<br /><br />Again, I keep thinking the problem must be me, the obtuse reader, not the writers, two of the world's most accomplished and erudite economists. The book has lots of cool antecdotes. But this average citizen (with a degree in teaching English, yes, and a weak command of business, I confess) did not feel any smarter coming away from this book. The back cover quotes experts who imagine a \\"coherent theoretical framework\\" to this \\"brilliant and engagingly written book,\\" but I never felt engaged for long, much as I tried to get into this book. If it's my fault, I'll own up to it, but...but...why was I able to read Richard White, but not Acemoglu and Robinson?rother Candidus, and their correspondence illustrates some key things about economic prosperity in...Roman England?

B00007LTIL|5.0|Well, let me see.......first heard this album better than 40 years ago.  During the first listen (I won't specify the circumstances!), it left an indelible mark on my brain and led me to visit Haight-Ashbury years after that first listen.  Box of Rain remains the most enigmatic song I've ever heard, though I understand Lesh's intent.  Ripple was used as for the \\"bridal dance\\" at my middle daughter's wedding (very lavish formal wedding, I might add!).  Friend of the Devil and Truckin' have been the story of my travels ever since that first listen and if ever in the circumstances of a party that needs to get moving (one way of another), you need American Beauty (or is it American Reality - if you stare at the cover art long enough).

Don't!<br /> It's reacher as we love him, just Child makes a few religious remarks and comments on the state of the military, and as always, some people cant handle other peoples opinions.<br />The plot in this one ramps up in intensity as you read, and makes some bold statements along the way. You won't be sorry adding this one to your collection

B007L3BMGA|5.0|I had so much fun reading the reviews on Amazon for `Fifty Shades'. There are some real jewels out there, and you guys cracked me up. I could agree with all the One/Two Star(s) reviews, I could... Most of what these readers say is true (and very funny, and well-written etc). I totally see where they are coming from, but... I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THE `FIFTY SHADES' TRILOGY<br /><br />Before I share WHY I loved the novels, I thought I would start by listing all the reasons you might find `Fifty Shades' a smelly pile of poo-poo meant for sexually-unsatisfied soccer moms.<br /><br />1/ The Suspension of (Dis)Belief<br />So, yes Christian Grey is a BILLIONAIRE mogul at the tender age of 28... He has even made his money all by himself after dropping from Harvard when he was 20 (I think Bill Gates did it, so why the h*ll not?). But what's really amazing is that the dude has a 9-to-5 job... I need the name of his headhunter-slash-career adviser pronto!<br /><br />2/ The Repetitive Writing<br />What most reviewers seem to find annoying is E.L. James' repetitive writing style.<br />I would tend to agree with all those points: the facial expressions, the lip biting, the 50 shades of everything, Ana's Inner Goddess (although the Goddess references often made me laugh) and her subconscious... They kind of are on almost every page.<br /><br />3/ The Non-PG-Rated Twilight Parody<br />Yes, sure, you can go on and on for that one: the location (Pacific NW), the hero and heroine sound-alike names (Edward Cullen/Christian Grey and Isabelle Swan/Anastasia Steele), the theme (falling in love with the evil), SPOILER the marrying and baby making, the characterization (the awkward, introvert, virginal girl being the most obvious), the mother of the heroine living in the South... Yes, yes, they are all there.<br /><br />4/ The Explicit Sexual Content<br />Actually, I haven't read reviewers objecting to that specifically. If you decide to read `50 Shades', there are enough warning signs out there to dissuade you to do so if you normally like inspirational romance.<br />No, what is more relevant is how unrealistic the sexual content is. Seriously, I'd like to know what Anastasia Steele is made up of (not steel for sure!): How does she do it? Same question to Christian: Dude, don't you ever get tired of... you know? Every five minutes? Really?<br /><br />Okay, I agree with everything you guys say... `50 Shades' is a love story where the two characters fall blindly and obsessively in love at first sight. There are no real subplots or secondary characters of any consequence. You basically read the book for the two key protagonists--Christian and Ana--and what's happening to them (they fight, they make up, they cry, they make up and so on). I can hear you... Yes, you there, in the back row. Repeat what you just mumbled, yes, out loud this time: \\"Boooooooring\\".<br /><br />Well, my friend, I strongly disagree with you. I'd say that it's GENIUS. Whether E.L. James is a literary genius or not, isn't the point. What matters is that she had a stroke of genius when she created those two characters. She captured something very deep, a secret need, a shameful desire inside many women of today. Yes, I said women because `50 Shades' is a well-orchestrated operation for us to fall in love with Christian Grey (and drop our panties doing so).<br /><br />Who is Christian Grey? A totally messed-up dominatrix seeking redemption through his love for a virgin. Ana needs his 24/7 protection, his exclusive and controlling ownership, his constant reassurance about her beauty and sex-appeal.<br /><br />What does that say about me? Or any other of those female readers who dived into it and have become totally obsessed with the trilogy? Is that the end of feminism? Do we all dream of being taken care of, pampered, worshipped, controlled? Can't we stand on our own two feet anymore and be independent and assertive?<br /><br />Nooooooo... Harsh critiques of `50 Shades' should give more credit to its readership. Do not underestimate us. We're not lobotomized damsels-in-distress. We can fight, we can bite (well. It's BDSM after all), we can win and make our own money. And so we will.<br /><br />I think the success of `50 Shades' reveal more about how we, women, perceive men nowadays, especially in the context of relationships. Should all men be control freaks like Christian Grey? Please, no, spare us that (and most of you guys aren't a billionaire mogul anyway, dud!). But (maybe, maybe) some of our expectations (the basic, \\"biological\\" ones) aren't met anymore. We need men to stand up more, to make us feel protected and safe, to make us feel... WOMEN...<br /><br />We accept for men to have as many shades in them as they want, but can they not forget to be... MEN?<br /><br />One last thing, I've seen many dream-casting on the Web for the coming movie. I would only say two words: RYAN and GOSLING.edit to its readership. Do not underestimate us.

B0063IH60K|5.0|Downloaded this on my kindle fire, works great! Ads pop up between games so not terribly annoying. Has different &quot;deals&quot; to choose from
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I was leary about buying a Kindle because I love books. I love reading them, flipping the pages, dog-earing where I left off, every thing about them. When I finally decided to purchase one I bought the pearl screen and this cover. I love it! It's as close to reading an actual book as you can get with a Kindle. Very cute!!!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|a fun and great game top play. very entertaining. great way to past the time. it does take to long to level up though.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|This is the slowest downloading program on the planet. It's taking literally a minute a song (on a 40 song album). I realize amazon probably wants people using the cloud storage and streaming for whatever dumb reason, but unfortunately for me i suppose, I want to actually have the music I paid for without having to log into a service to use it. Total BS imo.<br /><br />This is why people fileshare...five albums would have been done and moved onto my phone by now so I can leave, but instead I guess I'll be here another half an hour.<br /><br />Also, this downloader just sucks. It keeps popping up windows media player every time a) the current song it is struggling to download has finished and then b) when the new song being prepared to download actually starts to download. I can't minimize the program permanently to keep the window down, and I can't close it because it immediately restarts itself, so the other screens I'm looking at keep getting interrupted. Worst program ever. I have no idea why this ridiculous, buggy-acting, painfully slow app is necessary to get the files onto my computer. STUPID.<br /><br />Also it is taking up so much bandwidth to download (how is it going so slow then????!) that it takes forever for an internet page to load. sweet.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is one of the best I've ever played.  It keeps me playing till the end of time!  There's always something else at every turn, jump, and slide.  This game will grab you at the very moment you press &quot;play&quot;.
B000VSYDRM|1.0|Four out of five stars?  Really?  I can't believe I actually watched this entire disgusting movie, since I did not enjoy a single second. The several good actors in this movie tempted me to watch it in the first place.  I only watched to the end because It had gotten four out of five stars and I assumed it had to get better or have a great twist in the end.  Lesson learned.  I kept hoping the story would finally gel into something worth watching, but unfortunately it never did.  Don't waste your time unless you enjoy the ridiculously absurd and disgusting.  Ah, Dustin Hoffman and Alan Rickman --- what were you THINKING???

B00009L1UP|5.0|Empire was the fourth full-length studio album from the Seattle based Progressive Metal band Queensrÿche. It followed up the classic concept album Operation:Mindcrime and caught the zeitgeist of the time, becoming the band's best-selling album to date.<br /><br />While Operation:Mindcrime was an artistic highlight for the band and gained them a larger public awareness than they'd previously enjoyed, it seemed as though with its follow up Queensrÿche wanted to deliver some of the same powerful yet accessible, complex yet catchy Metal but without the constraints of the concept. They wanted every song to work individually and not just as one part of a whole that doesn't always work out of context.<br /><br />They also didn't want to be specifically just a Prog band or just a Metal band anymore, they wanted to concentrate on songwriting and make every track as if it was a hit single.<br /><br />For most people, Empire achieved exactly that. Buoyed by a trilogy of big singles in the form of the socially aware Title Track, the emotional `Jet City Woman' and the superb ballad `Silent Lucidity,' Empire was not only a hit among a legion of new fair-weather fans, but a success with the core fan base too, and now it is looked back on as a classic, almost as much as Operation:Mindcrime. If like me you weren't there at the time and only heard of the band in recent years, it is a great record to get into even now, and stands the test of time really well.<br /><br />There are some fans who disagree however and sometimes Empire gets painted as being a massive departure and slated for not sounding enough like what came before it, it can be seen as either (or both) a selling-out or an over-simplification if you got into the band through the channels of either a love of early Metal or a love of Prog more than just a love of Queensrÿche themselves.<br /><br />For many fans however, there is more than enough similarity with the previous albums to be heard. Although there is nothing as straight forwardly Metal as `The Needle Lies,' `Surgical Strike,' `En Force' or `Queen Of The Reich' from their previous releases, Empire still fits in with the band's overall sound rather well.<br /><br />Tracks like `Della Brown' and `Silent Lucidity' fit with the band's previous takes on balladry, such as `I Will Remember' and `I Only Dream In Infrared,' and also the synthy but dark and slightly proggy `The Thin Line' fits in with things like `London' and `Suite Sister Mary.' The pre-chorus of `Jet City Woman' is even a little reminiscent of `Take Hold Of The Flame' after a fashion.<br /><br />The band do undoubtedly push things in a more commercial direction on this album, but they still do things in a bit more of a complex and impressive way than most other commercial MTV Rock/Metal albums of the time and there are enough distorted riffs and lead guitar still there to keep most fans happy. It pretty much nails the balance between retaining what make Queensrÿche good and delivering big, bright and catchy, commercial rock music.<br /><br />If you ignore musical-style altogether however, this is plain and simple a collection of very good songs.  The musicianship is excellent, Geoff's vocals are inspired and the lyrics are for the most part intelligent and interesting. There's lots of little spidery riffs and vocal lines that will get stuck in your head, and most of the tracks can enliven any compilation or live set.<br /><br />Overall, Empire is a great album and even if wasn't what you wanted from the band in terms of musical-direction, it is a fine achievement purely in terms of songwriting and performance. This is one of the band's biggest albums for a reason and the three big singles alone are reason enough to explore the album, never mind things like `Best I Can' and `Resistance.' If you are interested in Queensrÿche this is a must-listen album.s straight forwardly Metal as `The Needle Lies,' `Surgical Strike,' `En Force' or `Queen Of The Reich' from their previous releases, Empire still fits in with the band's overall sound rather well.<br /><br />Tracks like `Della Brown' and `Silent Lucidity' fit with the band's previous takes on balladry, such as `I Will Remember' and `I Only Dream In Infrared,' and also the synthy but dark and slightly proggy `The Thin Line' fits in with things like `London' and `Suite Sister Mary.'

B005LAIH2W|5.0|I often wondered why the so-called \\"movie critics\\" panned \\"John Carter\\" and why Disney will be losing money on it. I thought the movie was well-done and action-packed as the writer Edgar Rice-Burroughs intended his John Carter Adventures to be.  I, for one, would love to see SEQUELS or the entire John Carter Series put into film.  Like the original \\"Conan the Barbarian\\", it will be enjoyed by generations to come REGARDLESS of the critics' bad reviews.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Legit porn for the housewife that wouldn't think about reading/watching porn.  The writing is not that great. Written for the tech age - lots of emails to read.  Makes me feel that is this is the \\"Twlight\\" series for the grown female - all about a dysfuncational relationship between the main characters.  Wasn't sure what the book was about when I purchased it, had been hearing the title referred to on tv.  Did  provide an escape somewhat, even if unbelieveable.  Trying to image the movie and how it can be made with swift and exact (and unbelievable) \\"details\\" of the book.  Won't be buying books #2-3.
0345803485|5.0|I love this book! I got the whole series! They are a very easy read. Iread them in no time. THis is one of those books that you can't put down after you start it. I would absoultely this book to everyone!

Ana also works at a hardware store, is plain and boring, comes from a divorced family, a virgin....does this sound like someone else??? I can't say Fifty Shades of Grey is horrible, however I don't understand all the hype. I am currently trying to read Fifty Shades Darker, it has taken me 4 weeks, and I think I am on chapter 3. I do plan to finish the books, and will probably sell them afterwards, they will NOT be going on my book shelf. BTW, this \\"inner goddess\\" crap is very annoying!!!!!!!!!

1401235417|5.0|I was disappointed when I heard the new 52 was going to reboot the DC universe.  I had been picking up a few of the current Batman TPB at my local library and catching up on the new stories and was not looking forward to reading about how Bruce becomes Batman all over again for a newer generation.  When I got Batman's newest arc 1-7 Court of Owls series I was surprisingly astonished that it kept the story going from where the 52 started. It still can be a jumping on point for newer generations because it recaps on two pages his past but it flows with the story.  It doesn't bog it down with flashbacks of a troubled Bruce struggling with the loss of his parents.  Though Bruce is very depressing and troubled still within these pages.  It establishes most of the villains in issue one and introduces the new villain Talon right after still within the first issue. This new villain or villains remind me of the Black Glove series but is far more interesting to me because it leaves Bruce confused as to how well he knows his Gotham city.  A particular fun spot in the TPB is when Bruce is hallucinating and by the time you get past the part you are a little confused as well.  Not to give to much away but by the time I was through reading this particular part I had turned the TPB around a few times to get my bearings.  A few highlights are seeing Joker fight with Batman, the above mentioned part, and the ending panel.  As I finished reading the last page I wanted to go out and subscribe to this series to see what is going to happen to Batman's Gotham city.  Great story arc that leaves you begging for more.

B005LAIHQS|5.0|MOVIE REVIEW #34 : \\" MIB:III (Men In Black III) \\"<br /><br />They definitely saved the BEST for last. MIB III is by the best of the three films in this franchise - why? Not because of the amazing special effects,  or the extreme use of incredible 3-D visuals thrown at you  - or - because of the incredible Rick Baker (Hellboy, X-Men: The Last Stand, Enchanted ) real creature make-up effects - it's because it mixed the best of storytelling and action/adventure with relatable characters and a sprinkle (or three) of good humor!<br /><br />Director Barry Sonnenfeld (Wild Wild West, Get Shorty) and writers Lowell Cunningham (Men In Black I & II)  and Etan Cohen (Madagascar 2, King of the Hill) did a very good job of bringing a characterization of obviously a sci-fi world, to real life. In emotion, they allowed the characters to grow and be flawed - and they tell why, how and even when. They did this film right and for the right reasons.<br /><br />The story involves the one thing that seems to mean blockbuster success at the box office - Time Travel (when they work - for example Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, The Terminator, Austin Powers: Man of Mystery!)  It's the concept of going back in time to prevent something that happened - from happening - changing the course of history. The time travel sequences are - if anything - original and stocked with amazing visual effects!<br /><br />Imagine Will Smith \\"J\\" traveling back in time to save Tommy Lee \\"K\\" from a murderous villain who survived but was not supposed too - while not changing an historical event in 1969 - Florida. Got it? The film tells and explains it all....creatively and humorously. Now add another amazing performance of Josh Brolin (W., No Country For Old Men) as accurately recreating every nuance of Tommy Lee as a younger version of \\"K\\". Will and Josh are just as amazing together as Tommy and Will.<br /><br />Will Smith (Hitch, Independence Day) and Tommy Lee Jones (The Fugitive, Batman Forever) have an amazing chemistry together and the first two films work well in terms of their comedy styling's, but this one has a big heart and compassion and you are not left `wondering why' as so many films tends to do in this genre. Tommy's dead pan delivery and Will's `off the cuff' deliveries make for some very funny moments.<br /><br />Some standout performances, if for their humor alone come from, Emma Thompson (Harry Potter, Nanny \\"O\\" McPhee) as the linguistically gifted Chief of MIB (it is sad to see Rip Torn not in this film) and Jermaine Clement (Rio, Despicable Me) as the ever creepy and extremely visual bad guy of the film. He is intense and extremely ruthless in his performance against Tommy Lee.<br /><br />The effects and CG, combined with the enhanced 3-D style of photography, just add to the film. It's fun, adventurous, candy to the eye and several times may make you jump with a few surprises. (All funny and alien in nature!)<br /><br />One other stand out performance comes from a character who can see as many as five alternate realities at a time - visually stunning and performed imaginatively by Michael Suhlbarg (Hugo, A Serious Man). His ethereal performance adds, explains and even enhances the story to where if this all could be true...this is how it would happen. He is also part of the reason this film has more of a heart than the first two.<br /><br />Lastly I cannot forget to mention Danny Elfman's (Alice In Wonderland, Batman) as the returning composer of the score. If you are not tapping your feet (or humming the tune) to the thumps of the MIB signature theme as the action unfolds...time to get your ears checked!<br /><br />This film had everything for me; it's fun, it's funny, it's got action, it's got special effects and - more importantly - it's got a great story with a good heart in the center of all of it.  I predict it will probably do well at the box office.

B006OV7RQ4|4.0|I wasn't going to write a review, but taking a look at the negative points of veiw on this film I had to. I'm not going to lie, the movie is slow. One reviewer wrote that this movie felt like it belonged in the 60's or 70's, and I couldn't agree more, it just has that style and feel to it. My issue is this, when people cite that Martha just seems stupid and formless and clay like, this is the part of the film I found interesting. She has been with a cult for two years. She has been brainwashed, and abused, mentally, sexually and emotionally, after two years of that kind of abuse you don't come out the same person you came in as. This is a girl who already has her past mistakes when she runs from home, and is then wounded and scarred in ways no typical human being can imagine, because the majority of us don't live a cult life. She then comes back to her sister only to second guess her decision to leave and be haunted by the horrors of her past. In my opinion this is a great and accurate work of the abuse from cults and its effect on people. Does it run slow? Yes it does, so just have some patience, tell your ADD to take a backseat, and learn.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book was very excellently written. It explores the absolute selfish and evil depths men will go to to protect themselves. It contrasts this with people who want the truth and believe that honesty and openness rather than fear and pain can go much further. This book also encourages writers who are just starting off that you don't have to be famous or get lucky to write and be successful. If you have talent and work hard, you can make a difference with you writing!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so fun!!!I got this for my seven year old daughter. and she loved it! you should totally get this app! it's. wi-ti free!
0345803485|3.0|I am not a regular reader of erotica.  I have read The Story of O and a couple of books by Anais Nin.<br /><br />On the plus side the author shows that the man is actively getting consent before sex and BDSM.  Many other similar stories, consent is dubious.  The sex scenes do make the bits tingle and that is the point of the book.<br /><br />On the negative, yep it is unrealistic, but it is a fantasy, isn't it?

0345803485|3.0|Is the writing great?  No, it's not even good.  Do parts seem immature and repetitive?  Yes.  But am I enjoying the book?  Yes, I am!  The book is erotica, not serious literature, and while I completely share the frustration offered by others that this piece of fiction has received such acclaim, while other, more talented writers struggle to get their pieces noticed, the fact is that this book sells because it's about sex, and it's reminiscent of \\"Twilight.\\"  It gives its almost entirely female readership what \\"Twilight\\" left them wanting: SEX. And I mention \\"Twilight\\" because I believe the author started this writing as fan fiction after the \\"Twilight\\" series.  If you read \\"Twilight,\\" then you can understand why this series has been so successful, since it felt like \\"Twilight\\" took us to the brink... and then splashed cold water on us.  Which I happend to have enjoyed, actually.  But \\"Fifty Shades\\" pushes us off the brink and gives us what we desperately wanted; we get to see two similar characters giving in to each other and having sex.  And sure, it's unrealistic, but is it really so bad to fantasize about unrealistic sex?  After all, there are plenty of books depicting more \\"real\\" sexual situations if that's what one craves.  \\"Fifty Shades\\" may not do it eloquently, and I may be missing something since this is about the only erotica I've ever read, but I for one, am enjoying the steaminess, cheesy as it may be at times.  If you appreciate the book for what it's worth, and not read it thinking you're about to read the \\"best of book ever\\" (as some misguided readers have said), I think you may just find yourself enjoying it.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|The first season of Mad Men is great!  I think any child of the 50's or 60's would love this series.  The authenticity of this show is unbelievable, from the clothing to the topics and products discussed, it gives the viewer a real sense of life in the 60's.  This series is now in it's 5th Season, so you have some catching up to do.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I can't stop playing this game. the only issue I have had is that it keeps telling me to restart to update and then I can visit other villages but it doesn't seem to get me anywhere after I restart. love it!
0618871713|5.0|I wasn't familiar with Alison Bechdel's work until Slate picked her new book, Are You My Mother?, for their audio book club. And since that one had a longer hold list at the library, I started with Fun Home. FH is a graphic memoir in which Bechdel describes her search for identity while also trying to find that of her father--a tightly-closeted homosexual who died in what might have been an accident a few months after Bechdel herself came out to her family.<br /><br />This is a book about questions rather than answers, so it lacks a conventional narrative. Instead, Bechdel paints her father in layers, overlapping and confounding time frames in order to build up a defined portrait of an admittedly enigmatic man. As a narrative device, chapters will revolve around a specific author or literary character that her father related to, and she loops these narratives back into her own discoveries with more than a few pithy observations. One of my favorite came in the first chapter when she asked what Daedalus most regretted when his Icarus plummeted into the ocean--the loss of his son or the design flaw in his fabricated wings. Another moment that resonated was a phone call after she came out to her parents in which her mother told her that her father had been having affairs with men and boys for years. Bechdel is most upset that she's gone from being a main character in her own drama to a footnote in her parents'. The familiar naivete of heady youth, coupled with the (sometimes literal) nakedness of her portrayal give this work a sort of fragil honesty. Indeed, who hasn't gotten angry at the world while they were in college? Who hasn't found themselves loving a parent in spite of their insanity? Who hasn't felt sorry for their family? Who doesn't have regrets? Who hasn't reinterpreted James and the Giant Peach as pornography?...<br /><br />But what's really on display here is Bechdel's masterful sense of storytelling, the attention to character-revealing details. I loved the contrast in two letters from her father, one jovial and littered with typos, the other despairing and corrected. I loved the simple tricks that come from years of being a cartoonist--the way a single image will be split across multiple panels to create a sense of conflict, or the way panels are changed only slightly in repetitions to affect pacing, to make the eye linger on an image.<br /><br />My only complaint with Fun Home is that Bechdel seems to run out of tricks in the last few chapters. The patterns become recognizable and I wasn't sure if she really had more to say or might just be filling out pages. It got a little same-y, but it never lost its earnestness. A very worthwhile read.
B0086700CM|5.0|Finally! I could play this game forever. it is so addicting! those people who make temple ruin are crazy and don't let them trick you. get the real temple run.
B007CKNX28|5.0|Jack White's first solo album exceeded all of my expectations. Give it a few listens, you'll feel the same! He's doing great things!
0439023513|3.0|I loved the first book - read it in a day (5/5). I really liked the second book - read it in two days (5/5). This last book was difficult to get through, but I managed to finish it over a few months (on top of a busy schedule). Still, there's ALWAYS time to read, I just wasn't motivated enough. It became more of a chore and \\"ugh, I need to finish this book so I can check it off my list.\\"<br /><br />It seems like the author might have been stuck, bemused rather, about where she wanted to guide the plot. There was not enough \\"steam\\" within the love triangle to keep me entertained. In the end, it seemed like the author just played \\"meenie-miney-mo\\" with the plot and went with the familiar pattern of romance. In conclusion, I would NOT recommend this last book. It would have been better to stop reading after finishing the second book of the trilogy instead to read the last one and be disappointed.
0345803485|5.0|I was recommend to read this book by co-workers. It turned out to be a great book. A very exciting and wonderful book. Full of surprises. I recommend that you read all three!
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for temple run to come on the kindle fire. this game is awesome. its an addictive game.
B0086700CM|5.0|I live this game I was waiting for it to download now I am playing. it non stop I love it
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love it so much fun. Good for all ages. Kinda like temple run. So much fun! Goes a little slow at first but then speeds up
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have never been compelled to write a review on Amazon until finishing the Wool Omnibus. I read a fair amount of sci fi and I have to say that this is one of my favorite books I have read in a long time. The writing was great, the story was great, the characters were compelling etc etc. Mr. Howey's writing is effortless and is incredibly natural. None of the plot feels forced. I can't wait for the next installment in the series, not to mention the movie! I have been recommending this book to everyone I know and hopefully they will all feel the same way I do. Keep em coming!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Entertaining.  Not too difficult.  Easy to use.  So far I have only lost once which may not be best for exercising your brain.
B000IZ6URY|1.0|I might have liked this movie when I was around 16 years old. You know, that time of life when you still think a fart is funny, but you're moving on to more \\"hard-core\\" humor that you are sure that your parents secretly like. Overkill, quite literally, is hilarious because you're mature enough to see how violence can be comedy if it's ironic. Yeah, farts are funny, but someone vomiting his brains out is some next-level stuff. Sure, saying \\"penis\\" makes you crack up, but d*ck and p*ssy along with a lot of graphic sex talk puts you in with the big boys. Of course, if it's all done with marionettes then it looks SO crazy hilarious that anything goes. Graphic violence, sex, language... whatever... takes you up a few notches into a new level of maturity that gets you ready for even more.<br /><br />I \\"get\\" this movie. It's irony. It's pop culture taken to the extreme. And if I were still a punk kid who didn't know that this stuff can really mess you up, then I'd give it a five star and start looking for more. But I've already been through that crap and it didn't help me in any way. This kind of stuff teaches you to laugh at the wrong things -- stuff that, at first, you're not sure why it's funny. But then you \\"loosen up\\". And when you retrain your brain to think this is funny, then you start to lose part of yourself and your ability to grow. And some people's minds never mature past 16 - and they make trash like this.
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm so happy that they have this bane now its about time right? I love this game so much whoo hop so happy right now
0545265355|5.0|I love that we now have this awesome series as a box set and the set looks lovely on my bookshelves.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|A  not to be missed summer time read.. Will keep the reader captivated throughout each chapter ..<br />  It is amazing what the human mind and body can endure, then begin to heal through the power of love
B0009MAP9A|4.0|The best songs here are not the most well known -- Ballad Of Hollis Brown, One Too Many Mornings, North Country Blues (could be his BEST SONG EVER!!), Boots Of Spanish Leather and When The Ship Comes In are definitely his best acoustic songs ever and maybe his best overall (except Like A Rolling Stone of course). The best known songs here (With God On Our Side, The Times They Are A Changin and Only a Pawn in Their Game) are actually the worst on the album and they drag it down to 4 stars - very dated and too obvous.  I actually prefer this to Freewheelin and Another Side of his acoustic albums based on the strength of the 5 great songs listed above which are totally AMAZING!
0743437497|5.0|It was great fun to forget about the iconic Stanly Kubrick movie and just sit back and read, with no pre-conceptions, Stephen King's early novel \\"The Shining\\".<br /><br />Somehow I never read the book before now, and I really got into this tale of a man troubled by severe personal and professional demons, further fueled by his barely-under-control alcoholism, who soon meets up with REAL demons when he and his family agree to be caretakers in an old, grand hotel while it's closed for the winter.<br /><br />A scary tour-de-force follows, but one that contains more realistic elements than you might expect.  We quickly see that Jack Torrance is like any of us, trying not to let personal doubt, weakness, and petty resentments keep him from performing his duties and responsibilities.  In Jack's sad case, however, a little too much of those things, coupled with a few too many bad decisions and judgments, leads to disaster.<br /><br />Of course, to be fair to Jack, various evil entities living in the Overlook Hotel constantly nurture his growing instability.  In a different situation, would Jack have eventually gotten his resentments and anger under control?  We'll never know.<br /><br />Anyway, not to be cold about it, but Jack's downfall is your gain, as the ever-building developments in \\"The Shining\\" will really keep you turning the pages.
B00026WU64|3.0|Like most of his acoustic albums, there are a few classics here (Don't Think Twice, and Girl From the North Country), several good songs (Blowin' In the Wind, Hard Rain), but more losers here than usual (Masters Of War - so dated, Down the Highway, Bob Dylan's Blues, Oxford Town, Talkin' World War III Blues, Corrina, Corrina, Honey, Just Allow Me One More Chance and I Shall Be Free all pretty much stink).  Much better places to start are Blonde on Blonde, Highway 61 Revisited, Bringing It All Back Home, Times They Are A Changin (for an acoustic album), Blood On the Tracks, or any of the many really good compilations - just too many losers here.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|I'm looking forward to the extras in the DVD package, although the film pretty much speaks for itself.  Suzanne Collins does a good job of Americanizing the Japanese story and film, [[ASIN:B000068LB5 Battle Royal]], which took battling school children to rather extreme levels.  Collins makes it a more [[ASIN:0439023521 compelling story]], rooted in Americana and pitting the kids against each other with more arcane weapons, in sharp contrast to the futuristic corporate fascist world of the Capitol.  Gary Ross obviously had to truncate the novel to fit within a convenient 2-hour time frame, so that we only get to know three of the children in any depth, but he amply succeeds in capturing the emotional impact of Rue's story.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence is wonderful as Katniss, and I really enjoyed Woody Harrelson as Haymitch.  The kids' relative innocence as contrasted to the cynicism of the adults is pitch perfect, but Haymitch proves himself to have his charges' best interests in mind, working behind the scenes to get his kids all the advantages they can have.  Lenny Kravitz is virtually unrecognizable as Cinna, and Stanley Tucci is all too often the show stealer as Caesar Flickerman.<br /><br />I heard quite a few concerns by parents who couldn't stomach the idea of kids pitted against each other in a fight to the death, but judging by my 11 year-old daughter's reactions, this is what held her attention.  I thought GAry Ross handled the theme very well.  The film had a strong visceral quality, holding close to the story without indulging in too much computer generated imagery.<br /><br />It was a movie that caught be my surprise.  Living abroad, I hadn't followed the Hunger Games phenomenon and was stunned by how much a first edition of the book sells for on the Internet.  I settled for the [[ASIN:0545265355 boxed Set]] to share with my daughter, as we await the next film in the series.

0345803485|1.0|If I could give this book zero stars, I would have. Ladies, don't waste your money. Go to the grocery store's $2.99 section of romance books. I guarantee they are written better than this pile of garbage.<br /><br />I hated the characters and have no idea why some (not all) women swoon over Christian Grey; a man who fits every textbook definition of a perpetrator of domestic abuse.

0143121006|5.0|I really loved this book.  It is so well-written, perfectly paced, great descriptions of Peking -- a time and place I knew basically nothing about before reading this book.  French's prose really made me feel as if I were there, and I like the thought that Pamela's name and story are now on the minds of thousands of people around the world.  I have a friend currently in Beijing doing research and I asked her to go to the foot of the Fox Tower and think of Pamela Werner.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|needed a light and this does the trick. could be brighter though but all in all its adequate. have it on my kindle fire
B007CKNX28|4.0|Jack White clearly operates on his own wave length and has a highly artistic and independent musical sense. This is one of the most original albums I've heard in awhile. There is an undercurrent of old school soul and blues yet it almost feels like listening to something futuristic at the same time. Eccentric yet full of emotion. I especially enjoy the songs with a strong use of piano. The use of the pedal steel on the title track is particularly beautiful. Other songs display a more raw power. I enjoy every song on the album. Stand out tracks for me are Missing Pieces, Blunderbuss, Hypocritical Kiss, Weep Themselves to Sleep, Trash Tongue Talker.
0553386794|4.0|The first half or more of this book was completely dreadful and an absolute bore to read (Probably why they did the first half of the book in one episode of the HBO series).  However about the half-way point the book did a complete 180 and I could not put it down.<br /><br />The second book leaves off right where the first ended and is every bit as good as the second half of 'Game of Thrones'.<br /><br />So my advice to anyone is try to get through the first half of the book because the second half is worth drudging through the first half.
B005URRCUY|4.0|I frankly wasn't sure about this album upon first listen. However I did not put it on the shelf. I continued to listen and by the 2nd or 3rd round I had changed my mind. I found the songs and beats became infectious. Blues undertones, garage rock guitar and driving drums. Really a solid album. Stand out tracks for me: Gold on the Ceiling, Little Black Submarines, Sister.
0312335164|5.0|While not as good as the novels with Robert Langdon as the main character, this is still an absolute must read.  Fast paced and full of twists.
B005N0C0JQ|4.0|Creative, lush arrangements. Seems Noel is now free to think and create out of the box. Great lyrical artistry. Noel crafts classic songs and extremely addictive melodies. If I Had a Gun, Broken Arrow and Stop the Clocks are stand out tracks.
0385504225|5.0|I could not put this thing down.  Thrilling from start to finish.  Best book of the 3 in the Robert Langdon series, completely blows DaVinci code out of the water.
0810994739|4.0|I think you should read \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Rodrick Rules!\\" There's a family with a mom and dad, Rodrick, Greg, and Manny.  This family is an important part to the book. I think it was kind of funny. I liked that Greg and Rodrick always were fighting in the beginning. They both got in trouble for fighting, and they were embarrassing their mom.  Also Greg's best friend is Rowley.  Rodrick has a band called Loaded Diper, and he's the drummer. Rodrick also does a lot of bad things. My favorite part is when they fight.<br />  These are some things that I didn't like about it.  It was boring in some parts. It's kind of weird because in one part Rowley was wearing underwear on his head.  It didn't really have a good story to it.  I didn't like the cheese touch thing. The beginning wasn't that good because they were at a skating party and nothing really happened.  I think it was too short.  My least favorite part was the cheese touch.  If you want to see more action, read this book.<br /><br />by Eric
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Lot of fun!  I would highly recommend this game for people who like puzzles without any time pressure.  I'm constantly being interrupted by my kids and I appreciate the lack of pressure.
0142410373|5.0|Oh my!  This girl has amazing talents. Her name is Matilda, and she is five years old.  On the first day of kindergarten, her teacher saw that she did her work too easily.  So she gave her  a lot of work ahead of time so that she would be challenged.  For a surprise, when her teacher told her parents that she was very smart, they didn't appreciate it at all. Her parents always made her do all of the work. They also bossed her around. For example, they wouldn't even let her read a book in peace.  One day, she got sick of the way her parents treated her. Read the book to find out what happens next.<br />  What I liked about this book was when Matilda scared her parents by putting a parrot in the chimney where they couldn't see it.  Then the parrot started speaking, and they thought it was a ghost.  It was funny because even the father screamed like a little girl.  That was hilarious. And what I didn't like about the book was when the mean principal locked Matilda in a scary closet.  That was very mean to her.  Oh, I almost forgot. If you want to know what her special talent was, read the book. If you don't, you won't find out because I will not tell you what it is.<br /><br />by Jessica
B00846REIS|3.0|The premise of this book is the same as every other romance novel, minus the explicit erotica. My biggest beef is the character development. The female lead knows nothing at all about the male lead, but \\"falls in love\\" with him. They talk about how they know so much about each other, yet they know nothing.<br /><br />I kept reading only because I hoped the author would redeem herself and build some background. It was minimally accomplished in the story line.<br /><br />I would've given it 2 stars, but at least my anger at the poor story details took my mind off my post-50 depression...
0439023521|5.0|Katniss Everdeen is sixteen years old, and lives in a poor district.  Her district is number 12. One day the whole district is being called for the Hunger Games.  They've done it for a long time. Katniss, her mother, and Primrose are going.<br />  Effie Trinket is going to pick. She is the most rich girl in the district.  She is picking the names. The first name she picks is Katniss' sister Primrose Everdeen.  Katniss volunteers.  Katniss is sixteen. She is very strong and good at hunting and getting people's attention with her arrows.  Rue is good at climbing trees.  She is very good at making a plan and very cute.  Gale is nice, sweet, god and helps Katness.<br />  There are a lot of characters: Katniss, Rue, Peeta, Marvel, Gale, Thresh, Primrose, Foxface, Hay Mich, Effie, Trinket, the mother, and others.<br />  What I didn't like is when Peeta kisses Katneiss and Gale loves her. Also I didn't like when she says goodbye to her mom and Primrose.<br />  The book is like the movie, if you are watching the movie, watch it with someone who is older than eighteen. The book has more details than the movie. For example, in the movie Haymich doesn't throw up and in the book he does.<br />  I like this book because it has romance, action, and fighting. You are going to love the book and the movie.<br /><br />by Martena
B0086700CM|5.0|Finally somebody had the brains to make this for the kindle and quit rippin us off with temple rum and cave runner!! Thank you Amazon!! I mean really.
1419702238|5.0|Wow! This book was the best book ever!  It starts when they have to be good or else they won't get presents for Christmas, and then they go to a cabin and there is a problem.  If you want to know, read the book, \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Cabin Fever.\\"<br />  The pictures are the best part. The characters are Rodrick, the older mean brother who tries to annoy Greg.  Greg is the main main character. Rowley is Greg's best friend who stays by his side no matter what.<br />  I would rate this book as a five out of five because everything was good except for it being too short.  Besides that, it had a good title, a tiny mystery, a good base line, surprising actions, and good characters.  So read \\"The Cabin Fever\\" for a good book.<br /><br />by Brian
B003XT60KO|5.0|This is an excellent introduction to economics. The best part about it is that it reads like a story-book rather than a text-book.

B004SUWR2C|1.0|It's nothing like when you play with you family! Just play real UNO! Don't get this app! If you get this app I will find you and uninstall every single app you own! Just kiddin'. But seriously don't get this app.
0345803485|3.0|Ok, I bought into the hype. This book is like a train wreck that you can't look away from. I'll make the comparison to the movie \\"Groundhog Day\\" where the same scene happens over and over again. The main difference is that I really like that movie. The rolling of eyes, and biting of lip, even the sex scenes, didn't I read this part already? Oh wait, it's just showing up again for the 100th time. AUTHOR - GET A THESAURUS. I haven't ruled out reading the other 2 books to the series but lets call this book what it is - an easy to read trashy novel. For those who describe it as a great love story, I question what kind of activities you are involved in yourself.<br /><br />Oh a side note, I've never read the Twilight books or seen the movies but if I found out the author was actually a teenage fan of those I wouldn't be surprised. The way the characters are described is ridiculous as well. A 27 year old billionaire who flies planes, plays the piano, listens to classical music, is educated about wine, tries to cure world hunger...like every page it was something new. We get it. At the mere age of 27 he's super awesome and can multitask. Plus the fact that he has a pretty serious fetish going on. He does all of this while running a company via phone calls on his blackberry, since that he never seems to set foot in the office outside of the initial interview. Pretty impressive. The author should have spent as much time looking into using different words and phrases as she did thinking up this perfect guy and assigning activities to him.

B006T3RM08|3.0|For the most part, this keyboard/trackpad tray works fine, and it does make it more convenient to operate your computer from the sofa or a comfy chair. However, the tab that pushes the power button on the keyboard is poorly designed, causing the keyboard to shut itself off/unpair from my computer frequently during use. When it did it for the third time in the first hour of use, and after re-adjusting the keyboard all three times to try to get a better fit, I gave up and took the keyboard and trackpad out of it. My keyboard hasn't shut off or disconnected a single time in the three days since, so I'm certain it's this tray causing the problem. I'm sending it back tomorrow, and looking for a better solution.

B0086700CM|4.0|This game was addicting as soon as I opened it, and was having a blast. That is until about my fifth round where I all of a sudden couldn't turn to the left, instead of turning, my guy slides right into the water! As frustrated as I was I chalked it up to my mistake, and changed the sensitivity, which didn't help either, I have the kindle fire and have never had a problem with it. Not sure if anyone else is experiencing the same problem, but I'm disappointed, and hope there is an update in the future that fixes this problem :/

0767817478|2.0|Godzilla (1998) is a lackluster movie with a thin plot, poor script, terrible acting, and mindless action. It's as if we're watching some video game instead of a movie. This movie does have good special effects, but these 'goodies' are very overshadowed by the things I mentioned. I was very frustrated when watching this movie, because it could've been executed a whole lot better. It will be interesting to see if anyone attempts a remake of this still very modern-day movie. Is it getting this pathetic nowadays? Does every movie need to be remade in the name of huge profits? Anyway, skip this missed opportunity of a film. 3.5/10
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Interesting book. I really like the way the author has described Mr. Jobs. A very good buy. Test test test. testti testti.
B004QNN1UI|5.0|So glad to have this wonderful concert from Simply Red's Farewell Tour! I've been a big fan of Simply Red since the 80's and have never had the opportunity to see them perform \\"live.\\" This is a wonderful concert featuring a nice selection of their biggest hits (20 in all) and also the companion cd with 16 songs.<br />As some other reviewers have said, I think there are too many shots of the Sydney Opera House. The venue is lovely though! The interview was very good as well, particularly Mick explaining how his set lists are determined,bringing the audience along at the right pace, so as to not cause the fans to rush the stage and block the views of the \\"high price ticket holders.\\" The interviewer is not present however, just questions posted on a page and then Mick's response. I always enjoy what he has to say.<br />Having seen the many ages and faces of Mick since the beginning, this concert brings his career full circle. His voice is just as lovely and strong as it has ever been and he is just as passionate about performing!<br />The girls(Dee and Sara) are not performing in this concert, so the guys do all the back-up vocals, which took some getting used to, but they did a decent job. I know the girls performed in London at the end of this tour, so I wonder why they were not in this show. It's a shame because their vocals are so outstanding.<br />I love how Mick talks about each song and is just so entertaining with the audience. He is and always has been so comfortable doing what he does.<br />Like many many fans out there who are sad to see Simply Red come to an end, this dvd/cd collection is the perfect way to remember and capture the feeling of the concert experience. I am anxiously awaiting Mick's newest venture as he still has a lot of music left in him!<br />I also purchased the \\"Home\\" concert filmed in Italy in 2003. It's nice to have two such outstanding concerts and I highly recommend both.

B0083GQ2A0|4.0|I had no idea this film held so many surprises, but rather I enjoyed it immensely moreso for the thought provoking drama, questioning the existence of god and the faith which we devote ourselves to and an appreciation for poetic realism. Liam Neeson leads a cast of  actors in a combination of WOLFEN (1981) attacks meets ALIVE (1993) the plane crash, with maybe a little frozen isolation of THE THING (1982) thrown in. A contracted game hunter named Ottway (Neeson) is hired to protect oilfield workers from predatorial wolves in Alaska, or the Artic. The film begins with Ottway battling his loss of love and unhappiness with himself as he is surrounded by low-lives and drunken misfits. His memories of love making with his woman are effectively weaved into this wasteland and an effective plane crash sequence both, but the real surprises are with the wolf packs that turn the tables on his small group of survivors as they become the prey. I remember seeing WOLFEN, with Albert Finney, when it came out about the lore of indigenous natives as \\"shapes-shifters\\" getting even with big business for land development and the wolves vision being thermographic, those elements made WOLFEN weak, but the horror factor is there for me as it is in THE GREY.<br /><br />THE GREY successfully places you in a frozen tundra, as THE THING did, with a feeling of isolation and vulnerability. Yet, as fragile and easy a target these men are, surrounded by beast, not canine or dog like animals, but huge bear sized wolves as one of the fellow survivors, Diaz (Frank Grillo), a fool turned sacrificial lamb, screams at the howling packs after almost losing his life in an attack and yells into the dark, eerie night, \\"You're not the animals, we're the animals\\" and proceeds to cut a dead omega wolfs head off as the men feast on its carcass, which they intentionally roast and eat for the pack to see from the dark treeline. Ottways attempt in the beginning of the film to end his own misery may well have been the reason his fate gives him the opportunity to choose between being another sacrificial lamb, or the alpha male himself, but not without \\"one last fray\\"? The film deals with each mans mortality and how we choose, or do not choose, to die. One interesting element expressed in the film is how people seem to see their loved ones as death approaches in the form of spirits or memories. I had always thought this to be soley a Native American thing, evidently, its in all cultures. The fight for survival is the films theme whether you be man, or beast and that sometimes, you have to be both in order to win your fight and that like wolves, men are either alpha or omega males.the reason his fate gives him the opportunity to choose between being another sacrificial lamb, or the alpha male himself, but not without \\"one last fray\\"?

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey's book -- my first read by him -- captured my interest and it was one of those books that are hard to put down. The characters had depth, the plot interesting, and the turns surprised me. It is set in a future where things MUST go unquestioned or else consequences will be enforced. I have already purchased the prequel to this edition and have enjoyed it so far. I highly recommend this book!

1400069289|5.0|What a fantastic book: so well research, so easy to understand, so very interesting. Duhigg shows over and over again that most of what we do is habitual, that habits can be changed and manipulated - by ourselves and by others.<br /><br />One of the things I found most enlightening and disturbing was that even if you have overcome a bad habit (say overeating), the neural pathways for overeating never go away. They are always present in the brain, and that's why it's so easy - with the right cues - to fall away from our good habits back to our bad. The opposite must also be true: Somewhere inside my brain there's still a neural pathway for running 3 or 4 times a week. I just haven't seen that pathway in a decade or so!<br /><br />I personally found the sections on businesses less interesting. (And, yes, like everyone else, I'm kind of disgusted by Target. Cash, anyone?) Nonetheless, seeing how businesses can be more and less successful by the organizational habits they promote makes me think back on places I have worked with new insight.<br /><br />A fantastic read and highly recommended.
B0018QQQK8|2.0|Read like a romance book without much romance. I found it boring and too predictable. I prefer a story with clever writing and more suspense.
B004EPYZV2|1.0|I pre-ordered this from Amazon.  I won't comment on the movie itself since that's a matter of taste.  But I was very disappointed that there were no \\"special features\\" on either disc.  I had the same issue when I pre-ordered the latest \\"Transformers\\" film.  Why pay extra to own when there are no extras included?  Both are Paramount films. In the future, I'll either rent or wait until they're on HBO or Showtime.  I'll also be much more careful when I pre-order Blu-Rays from Amazon.  I won't buy if there are no special features and I won't re-purchase the same movie if it's released later with the special features.
B007SGM084|2.0|After completing the 2nd book and begining the 3rd book I began to become disinterested in the sex scenes.  They were too similar and frequent that I started skipping through them.  I became more interested with the background of Mr. Grey and how he became the way he currently is. I still need to finish, but am not as interested as I was in the beginning. I'm hoping the author will tie it all in soon. I think she spent far too long with too many unnessary sex scenes, possibly to increase sales. We sort of got the point after the second book!
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This story grips you from the beginning and never lets you forget the untold and forgotten atrocities that occurred in our lifetimes.

Read this book, cry, smile and most of all remember.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|Tucker & Dale is a fresh mix of humor and b-budget horror. We laughed and made exclamations repeatedly. Set in the woods, as all good slashers are, a young group of people meet of a couple of hicks and the blood begins to flow. Oh, and how many times can a young lady get knocked out before she begins to get suspicious? That is why she makes a good morph to a hick.
0061537934|2.0|Because of personal experience, I found the book painful to the point of being manipulative.  I love dogs, and have no problem accepting that they know more than they can communicate, but this books reads like a canine version of the '60s Love Story.  If you've lost a loved one to cancer, a good volume to avoid.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|With all of the buzz, I had to check out these books. I was disappointed that the writing was not where I expected it to be and that the heroine was in a relationship that was controlling. I understand the basis of a dominant/submissive relationship, but if my friend started seeing someone and they treated her like Christian Grey treats Anastasia Steele, I would hope she would run the other direction.

I was just going to use these until I could afford better ones but they really aren't bad. I waited quite awhile before reviewing and have to say they get the job done. They aren't the most comfortable shoes but I don't notice them being uncomfortable either. It does seem to run a little small though. I haven't slipped or had any problems. They sure aren't cute but they work.

0446585025|5.0|I chose this book because I love Ellen; she is such a funny human being, I love her personality. The book is full of comedy and seriousness all wrapped in one book--she knows how to entertain her audience.<br /><br />This book pretty much showed a side to Ellen that you have never seen from her. One of the themes I noticed was \\"no stone unturned, no door unopened, no window unbroken;\\" it was basically her saying that she's going to tell you everything, including things you don't know about her. Ellen uses unusual words in her book, for example one was ostentatious, which means \\"intended to attract notice and impress others.\\" Ellen's use was intended to impress her readers. One review I read said \\"you might be able to grab a hold of what it means to be a good person;\\" I totally agree with this statement because Ellen does show, among other things, that not everyone is perfect.<br /><br />I would totally recommend this book to anyone who loves Ellen DeGeneres.<br /><br />TJHS 11th grade student

0345803485|1.0|I don't often post reviews, largely due to laziness and the fact that I read way too many books to have the time, but I felt like I needed to throw my warning into the bag.<br /><br />There are many things wrong with this book - the terrible writing, the repetativeness, the repetativeness, the repetativeness, the fact that it is fairly blatant as a Twilight fanfic (yes she changed the names, but not the character 'descriptions', as flat and one-dimensional as they were), the boring and surprisingly vanilla sex scenes, the fact that one is not actually aware of their own subconscious (that's why it's 'sub'-conscious, as in under the level of the conscious mind), and many other things.  But the biggest problem I have with the book is the fact that Christian Grey is an abusive boyfriend.<br /><br />Seriously.  I do not understand why so many readers find him appealing when he ticks off all the warning signs of an abusive boyfriend.  Ana should be running far far away as fast as she can.  Wanting to control her in the bedroom in a bdsm-sense would be one thing - that is play and it is something that (should be) is discussed ahead of time, with safewords and all of that.  Fine, I have absolutely no problem with that (and would be interested to see a novel that properly portrays bdsm).  But his need to control her goes far beyond that and into scary territory.  He sends her expensive gifts and demands that she takes them.  He has clothing picked out for her.  He does not want her to have other males in her life, especially not any that show her any interest.  He does not want her to talk about the bdms lifestyle to anyone but him, despite the fact that she is completely new to it - he should be pointing her in the direction of books and people she can converse with to get a better idea of what she's in for.  He makes her cry on numerous occasions (and the book only spans a very short period of time).  He is constantly forcing her to eat when she says she's not hungry (thefact that she never seems to eat is another issue entirely).  He FOLLOWS HER on her trip to visit her mother.  Basically, he swoops into her life, rearranges everything to his liking, largely takes her away from friends and family and dictates how she should be.  And this is a man so many people find sexy?  I found him creepy to the nth degree.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|Such a great book cant waite for the next ....its a must read...you will love it very fast smooth reading ..I was hooked couldn't put book down.
B0049P1VHS|3.0|I'm not into the zombie genre but I did like \\"I am Legend\\" and the 60's classic \\"The Last Man on Earth\\" (oops, and The Omega Man) which were basically all based on the book I am Legend.  Anyway, this is as close to \\"I am Legend\\" being made into a series as I've seen.  Somehow I can connect with the characters and want them to survive, and I suppose that's why I kept watching episodes through the first season.  Talk about breathing new life into an old genre!  Also, I love the way the \\"walking dead\\" are called \\"geeks\\", since I imagine that geeks make up much of the demographic that make this show so popular.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because it's obviously low budget (but pretty well acted), requires some suspension of disbelief, and the redneck stereotype guy got sort of predictable (always going off over something) but then again it's a show I watched when I was brain-dead at the end of the day so that stuff didn't matter much.
0307730697|3.0|Let's list the ways in which this is not my typical sort of book: non-fiction, biography, focuses on the armed forces.  Yep, that pretty much sums it up.  In short, this sticks out on my bookshelf.<br /><br />For some unknown reason, I thought I would give this book a shot, in part because I am trying to try new things and experience different things.<br /><br />Here goes: this book is meant to let us know who Adam Brown was.  He was on Navy Seal Team SIX, which apparently is the best of the best.  The team is now known for taking out Osama Bin Laden.  We are taken into his life before the Navy, and actually even a bit before Adam, getting some knowledge of this family before he was even born.<br /><br />Surprisingly enough, I liked this book.  I didn't love it, but I was glad to have read it, if just for an insight into military life that does not necessarily glorify violence and gore, or assume that the reader thinks that war is amazing.  Is the book perfect?  No.  And I am not sure that I would have liked it as much had I started reading with the assumption that I would like it.  (Call it the anticipation syndrome, but when I assume that a movie or book will not be something I enjoy, then said movie or book tends to be better than expected, and vice versa...sometimes books or movies with a lot of hype do not live up to it).<br /><br />We get a lot of information about Adam's childhood.  He lived his life full steam ahead.  He was not necessarily the person with the most sheer physical ability, but he tried hard and was always up for a challenge.  And he was wild, but in a good way.  He jumped off the bridge into the water below, he wanted to take on the biggest guy on the football field, etc.  However, he looked out for others, and the book includes a touching scene where he befriends a boy with Down's Syndrome.  There were a few parts in the book I found hard to take, and Adam's near saintliness as a child was one of them.  As a former teacher and parent, it ishard to believe that a person can be so aggressive and so kind.  Later on, they use the term \\"gentle giant,\\" and I get that, but I also have to think that there is some amount of revisionist history going on here.<br /><br />The next main section of Adam's life covers his addiction to drugs, and isolation.  The transition to college was a tough one for him, since he missed being part of a group.  He was aimless and ended up being addicted and letting drugs run his life.  He made a lot of poor decisions during the time.  Sharing this part of his life is supposed to make us realize that no matter what your background (he had a good family), you can fall prey to drugs, and also to point to Christ, who Brown credits for saving his life.<br /><br />The remainder of the book covers Brown's life as a husband, father, and Navy Seal.  Again, some of the reports are almost too much for me.  I don't expect anyone to discredit him, but he often comes across as superhuman (and I get that some of these elite military personnel need to be close to that, but it's a bit too sugar coated for me).  For example, there are times when he reverts back to drugs, and his wife tells him that if he does not stop, then she will leave him.  But even in those times, when it must have been very stressful and hard, we get an image of him that doesn't seem quite real.<br /><br />However, there are other snapshots of him that make the reading rewarding and make it seem like maybe some of the other surreal ones could be true.  One of my favorites was when he brought Afghan children shoes and asked for his parents and others to send more shoes for these kids instead of any sort of gifts for him.<br /><br />I liked the image of the families of the military gathering together as a family themselves.  I also appreciated the brotherhood pictured among the Navy Seals teams.<br /><br />My least favorite section of the book is a bit crass: Brown never backed down from a challenge, and so somehow along the way, he agreed to have his naked testicles on an anthill for a certain amount of time.  Several others put in money, and when he made it through the \\"challenge,\\" he earned all of the money that was put up.  Mainly I was concerned that he put himself (and others) at risk over something so juvenile, because he was quite swollen afterwards and in bed for a couple of days, (if I remember correctly), even though he was on duty.  He used the money to buy his wife a piece of jewelry she had admired but they could not afford.  Afterwards, when the couple was with other couples in the military, the wives of the other men expressed wistfully that they wished their husbands had done that.  I found that repulsive, actually, as well as just plain odd.  Perry, if you are reading this, I never expect you to have your testicles bitten by insects and then buy me something with the money earned.<br /><br />On the other hand, I was glad that the book was not white washed even though it was published by a Christian publishing company.  While not laced with profanity or anything like that, there are some quotes that included questionable language or a curse word.  I thought that the inclusion of those words, without going overboard, added legitimacy to the book.<br /><br />I would recommend this book highly for those interested in military stories, as well as parental or teaching figures who may want encouragement in situations where those they love have gone astray or those they are responsible for are not exactly following protocol.  It's an easy read, and while it doesn't flesh out all people in his life to the degree I would like, it does let us see how a life can change when given a chance.<br /><br />I was given this book free of charge from the publisher.  All opinions are my own.
B00000ILDE|5.0|I bought this recently because it is one of my favorites.  I was concerned that it might not hold up well since it was released in 1986 (I was a teenager when the original ALIEN was released).  This is the Director's Cut, Dolby, Special Edition, THX, with Widescreen. It was directed and written by James Cameron; Produced by Ridley Scott; and has a great cast including Sigourney Weaver, classic Bill Paxton, Lance Henriksen, Paul Reiser, and great in this role - Michael Biehn (by far my favorite movie with him in it).  It looks great, the filming is spectacular, and you really cannot tell that the movie is 25 years old.  Huge science fiction fans, this was the first time my kids (3 teenagers) saw the movie and they loved it.  Beware - there is profanity, but no nudity.  Really fun if you like horror, science fiction and intense creature films.

B007BZM30M|1.0|I love pop music of the 80's but I also love some jazz, folk, rock and classic. Due to certain circumstances I had to sit in a car for 1 1/2 hours (and another 1 1/2 hours back home) almost all the time listening to not only THIS song but to a couple more of the same style - if you want to call this a style.<br /><br />Am I old-fashioned? Have I forgotten about being a teenager? However, I cannot understand that such music - so terribly superficial, with horrible lyrics and arrangements that make you run away seem to be that appealing to young people. When I was young (basically in the 80s) I listened to the Beatles, Michael Jackson, Depeche Mode and other stuff. When groups like NKOTB and Take That became popular I could not stand them and I did not care about any of the cute faces. But compared to what is sold to teenagers these days those groups were even good!<br /><br />It was a real torture listening to \\"call me maybe\\" and other hollow noise and when I finally got out of that car I could not help it but put in a Ben Howard album (could have also chosen Gotye or some Pearl Jam...at least something with a deep meaning, a real guitar and a character behind the music).<br /><br />Just because you are a teenager it does not mean you have to listen to teen pop...its not teen...it is below zero.

1609613937|3.0|Drawing upon more that 40 years of experience, John McDougall MD has penned a book describing this journey. McDougall has an interesting biography and life history that is germane to his work. He was a distinctly unhealthy young man, overweight and ill ( having suffered a stroke at the age of 19). After completing his medical training at Michigan State University, he ventured out to Hawaii, where he worked as a plantation doctor. There he took care of 5,000 folks of Asian descent; and he observed that the older Asians were lean, long-lived and strikingly free of the usual diseases of the West such as, Type 2 Diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and certain cancers (breast, colon, prostate and ovarian). Each succeeding generation was fatter and had a bigger bag of pills. He studied their diets and found that the older Asians ate mainly rice, vegetable and small amounts of animal protein. The younger Asians ate fast food and an animal based diet. He then researched the history of diet among various populations and found that long-lived, healthy and strong groups ate a mainly starch-based diet.<br />He then constructed the so called &#34;McDougall Diet&#34;, a nutrition plan centered around rice, corn, potatoes and sweet potatoes; with the addition of fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole wheat. For the last 30 years he has promoted this plan with books, lectures, newsletters and through his Medical Center in Santa Rosa, California.<br />Dr McDougall has helped many folks achieve health with his plan and others have not fared so well, but we'll never know about them because only &#34;Star McDougallers&#34; are placed on his website. Dr. McDougall seems to suffer from confirmation bias, he quotes studies that support his diet and neglects others that don't. He falls prey to individual anecdotes and appears to think that they are more powerful evidence than controlled trials. For example, he has done videos saying as much about rheumatoid arthritis, a subjectthat I very familiar with. He thinks that RA is caused by a bad diet and can be &#34;cured&#34; with the McDougall diet. He even did a study that showed a marginal short-term benefit in a group of patients who ate his diet in a controlled setting. Unfortunately, no study has ever shown that a vegan diet &#34;cures&#34; RA or prevents progression of erosive disease. RA is a complex illness that involves an interaction between genes and the environment. Risk factors include, cigarette smoking, periodontal disease, obesity etc. Similarly, he has indicated that his diet can treat MS, but the study through Univ. of Oregon showed no effect on disease activity in patients treated with his diet. Dr. McDougall is prone to interesting proclamations such as: &#34;dairy is more toxic than cigarettes and alcohol&#34; that serve to diminish his credibility. His answer to just about any malady including fibromyalgia is the McDougall Diet. If your only tool is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.<br />I have seen patients do well with a starch based diet and others get sick and not do well. His diet is not a panacea, 1 out of 100 people with celiac disease will get sick on a starch based diet that contains wheat. So as someone, who has been on a plant-based diet and has witnessed many others on the same, I can attest that one size does not fit all. The health of any organization is evidenced by it's embracing of dissenting viewpoints. Dr. McDougall seems very intolerant of any contrary viewpoint.
B0086700CM|5.0|I played this app on my friends Iphone and instantly I was hooked. Then I realized it wasn't on the kindle and I was so hummed. So when they finally did add it I naturally bought it.

B007JUWM64|1.0|I am not a person who reviews movies very often, but this movie required me to put forth the effort.<br /><br />The reviews of this movie suggest that this is worth the watch. This cannot be farther from the truth. I watched this movie with a couple friends and some family members who were in town. It was similar to slow death with the sound of nails on a chalkboard while getting water-boarded 183 times like Kalid Sheikh Muhammad.<br /><br />The historical line is so far from anything remotely accurate, which would be fine, but the story line, character development and ChuckyCheese vibe of the movie had me squirming in my seat the whole time.<br /><br />I am literally considering buying this movie just to break it into one-thousand pieces like the scene from office space. I have been traumatized and completely offended by the powers that be whom allowed this movie to happen.<br /><br />Save yourselves, don't walk, but run away and never look back. The fact that people gave this movie five stars is appalling and questions my faith in humanity.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game made it to level 51 all my goals I was trying to complete disapeared when I did a new update no klnew goals have come only thing I've gotten is goals that say they are all done when I click on them hope more come soon
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is a terrific Bible app.  My only problem is that it requires wifi to be used.  Oftentimes when I need it I don't have wifi access...that is not good.
0345803485|4.0|I bought the e-reader version of this book on Saturday, was finished by Sunday afternoon.  Could not put this book down.  Re-reading again before downloading the 2nd book in this series just to be sure I didn't miss anything.  What a cliffhanger at the end of the book.  Definitely eye-opening!  If you do not like explicit details in regards to sex scenes- this is not the book or series for you.  Anyone interested in experimentation this is a great book for you.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|This movie has more twist and turns than a rollercoaster. WARNING!!! This movie is very graphic and the subject matter may be disturbing to many people (incest - brother/sister, father/daughter, practicing dentistry with a hammer, and self-mutilation). Besides that the movie was quite entertaining for your typical revenge movie. The acting was a little stilted and the plot was one of those \\"made in Hollywood\\", could never happen in a million years scenarios but \\"Oldboy\\", in my opinion, pulls it off. It is definitely a movie to rent.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like how it stays in my notifications so its easy and conveniant to get to. Works great for kindle fire. No problems out of it here.
8866131369|3.0|The paper is very thin. It feels like it will tear easily. I haven't started to use it fully since it starts with July. When you use a pen it shows through, when you use pencil-well it doesn't show through but I won't try and erase anything because if feels like it would tear. I would send it back but I haven't been able to find another planner with this layout. I think I used one of these two or three years ago, I don't remember it being so fragile. I used a different brand last year but they seem to have gone out of business. So, good design, poor execution.
140123755X|5.0|One of the few books (or any type of media for that matter -- movies, music, etc.) that I keep coming back to.  While published as a series, this does not read like a serial.  The over-arching plot actually advances, and when it slows down, we don't mind because the side-stories are also great.  There are so many characters who become so rich and grow and change over the course of this title.  And while Lan Medina's illustrations in this first volume are striking and almost pulpy, Mark Buckingham's sharp lines and margin-scenery really begin to convey the vastness and emotion in the series.  I cannot say enough good about this book (and those following).  Quite possibly my favorite work of literature in any form.
B005LAIH3G|4.0|Only thing that was bad about this movie was it's marketing/titling.  Good job for near preserving the story based on \\"A Princess of Mars\\" in a movie time frame.  Wife and I enjoyed it enough to order the 3D combo.  Hopefully international sales might give it a second chance.
B0086700CM|5.0|Finally kindle fire came out with TEMPLE RUN. Ive bee. waiting since I got this thing to get this app. and now its here!  Its worth the wait!!
B0086700CM|5.0|omg finally I have been waiting for it on kindle fire it was on ipod touch and Iphone and I am so happy it is finally on kindle fire. yaya
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I have enjoyed the previous 3 books in this series. This final book is maintaining the interest and is very readable.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|Takes a bit to get the hang of it but it's a blast once you figure it out. There are quite a few scenes and multi-<br /> levels to each one so you really get your money's worth.
B004DSX5B6|5.0|Great quality. I had a gerber multi before that spent alot more for but lost it.  Seems very rugged and durable. Lots of options with tool.  Does not squeeze hand to close pliers to compact the tool like other gerbers so this is great concept.  Not sure of sheath-not quite big enough.
B007N0REX6|5.0|I must say that I was happy to purchase this CD after listening to it on Rhapsody and finding that I liked about half the songs on first listen. I have been listening to it pretty much constantly since, and find the entire CD is actually very, very good.<br /><br />Pros: ROCK SOLID instrumental work. Slash's guitar is \\"on fire.\\" Great rock sound like you don't hear much anymore, which can best be described as virtual energy emanating from the speakers.<br /><br />Cons: The vocals on a few of the songs have to \\"grow\\" on you is the best way to describe it. Think of it like old GNR or Bruce Dickinson. Remember that first time you heard either...and thought \\"What the...?\\" Well that describes some of the vocals on this CD, in that they are unexpected. That said though, the more I listen the more I like.<br /><br />If there are rock gods up there, we will hear this a lot on the radio this summer.
B0086700CM|5.0|I really love this game so much fun. fun fun fun fun fun fin fun fun fun fun fun fun
B005LAIHPE|4.0|Scientists discover an earth like planet in another solar system that is in the Goldilocks Zone, not to hot and not to cold. It is an ideal planet for the possibility of extraterrestrial life. Big enough to hold an atmosphere and all the indications that life could evolve there. They build a massive transmission system to broadcast a message to the planet from Hawaii via a high power satellite in the hopes of finding intelligent life. They get more than they bargained for. Be careful who you invite to your home, you just might not like them....<br /><br />I won't go into detail as I don't want to ruin this movie for you but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is nonstop continuous action that was entertaining. I love Sci-Fi and I watch it for enjoyment. This movie was exciting and fun to watch and I liked the story line and the special effects were just out of this world, literally.<br /><br />Of course it is hokey in some places, of course they take liberties with technical aspects and military details that are incorrect but it is a movie for entertainments sake. It is fast paced, high action with the US Navy and the alien forces head to head for the survival of the planet earth. The aliens are aggressive and dangerous with advanced technology and weapons. The special effects were well thought out and done to perfection. The aliens are actually in the light and you get to see them and it is not filmed in the dark like most alien movies are done. The camera work was great and the soundtrack is awesome.<br /><br />If you like Sci-Fi movies then you will like this one! Don't believe all the professional movie critics, this movie has already made $280 million worldwide and it has only been released 11 days ago in the USA and sold $48 million in USA ticket sales.<br /><br />My wife, grandsons and I all liked this and so will you! We will buy the DVD when it is released.
B000QCS8TW|3.0|And just in case you weren't sure that is not a good thing to say about a book.<br /><br />From the random and completely unnecessary to the plot sex scenes to the nice and easy to split into episodes plot every aspect of this book seems to be geared towards selling the TV rights.<br />The characters are mostly 1 dimensional and straight out of the generic fantasy characters list (the honest and honor obsessed good guy, the heartless power obsessed schemer, the good and evil knights etc...)<br /><br />By about halfway through the book I'd concluded that there were only one or two of the characters I cared about, the others were either so stupid they deserved whatever they got or so clearly stereo-typically evil that you expect them to start to twirl a long skinny mustache at any moment.<br /><br />Yet despite all of that I did find that I kept reading and was even half tempted to get the next book in the series so it's not all bad. It's simply a run of the mill fantasy novel, nothing special but better than some of the junk out there.
B007HO392S|4.0|A good mixture of fast paced up-tempo music to slow ballads. Most of the songs are based on a theme of love with a combination of light rock style to country.  Carrie's Oklahoma country roots show through and the entire album is very enjoyable.<br /><br />I really liked Good Girl and it was fast paced and it shows the power of Carrie's voice talent.  Good In Goodbye is a slow paced and soft ballad.  Do You Think Of Me is about old love and memories, we all have them and this song reminds us of the things we left behind.<br /><br />Thank God For Hometowns is a great ballad that reminds you that you have a place to go back to with memories.  Wine After Whiskey, a ballad with a deep message of having a strong love to moving on to something weaker and less meaningful.<br /><br />This CD is a compilation of 14 great songs sung by a woman with a beautiful voice.  I enjoyed them all and if you like Carrie Underwood, you will love this album!

B004W2UBYW|5.0|Background:<br />Both me and my sister simultaneously read the book. I am an electrical engineer and she is an administrator with little knowledge or interest in technology. She seemed to find the book equally interesting and was able to follow everything despite the occasional tech jargon.<br /><br />Review;<br />I thought Isaacson did an excellent job with capturing the life of Steve Jobs accurately while still making the book intriguing and making you want to read more. I guess the fact that Jobs was a real \\"character\\" in himself made this all the easier. The book appears very objective, Isaacson seems to try very hard to offer insight into all aspects of Job's life, regardless of the impression it leaves on the reader. Jobs is portrayed as rude and inconsiderate of others while being incredibly smart, intuitive, and calculating in his every move. Though Jobs does not come across as a typical role model, he still offers many insights into his success, learning from failures along the way. When discrepancies in the story arise between Jobs and another character in his life, Isaacson always presents both sides and lets the reader determine the truth with only a small commentary on his impression.<br /><br />Despite the harsh character of Jobs and the sad nature of the ending, the book is enjoyable to read. It is captivating and written in a way to keep some suspense despite the fact that many of the stories are well known and the endings can already be assumed. The book starts chronologically through Jobs life and the beginnings of Apple. Around the middle, it changes and each chapter becomes more of a segment of Jobs life focusing on one idea, business, event or personal conflict. These segments tend to have overlapping timelines but Isaacson uses dates, relationships, and key events to keep the reader aware of how the stories interact with each other. I found it easy to follow and the way the stories are told keeps you wanting to read more because you can't anticipate exactly what will follow with the slightly altered timeline.<br /><br />Personally, I read the book because I always thought Steve Jobs was an interesting Character. He seems to have somewhat of a magic touch with technology and I was just hoping to learn a little more about him and what shaped his life and ultimately led to his success (and failures). After reading the book, I have the impression that he really was a remarkable businessman and entrepreneur but his real genius was in spotting talented people and great ideas and then refining (both ideas and people) until they were perfect at any expense. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the book.

B007BZM3HK|1.0|aw come on you all!this song is TERRIBLE!<br />So lets go through it.she meets this guy and gives him her number.and then she repeats call me maybe like 50 times.and then,what really cheeses me off about this whole song is :after all this yappy crap over and over,they NEVER  say wether he calls!<br />is there like another song on the album that tells?like \\"he called me and we hooked up\\"?or a plan for a follow up single?<br />they couldve had a booty call,a relationship,a group setting,a marriage,he couldve knocked her up,he couldve really been a girl and then she liked it anyway,a engagement proposal,a murder,they got high and he was a cop,or he called and she missed it and she got mad and then freaked out and had a meltdown before he found her at the club and explained how his phone died or some crap.that was a top ten list of better ways the song couldve ended right off the top of my head.i couldve thought up 100.<br />the beatles probably puke every time they hear this.\\"we brought pop to this world and its degenerated into this!\\"the other 2 are rolling around in thier graves wondering where it all went wrong.<br />if you like this song,then buy it.you've no doubetly heard it.they play it at least once every hour on every dance,pop,top 40 radio station around here.<br />this is just another fine example of just how far down music has come.i havent even bought a new album in like 3 years.the last one was bob dylan.before you go talking trash on that american master,he just got the medal of freedom from the president.i'll bet whoever this chick is,that never happens to her.i give her 3-5 years before she's broke again and turning tricks.

B0052RDHTM|5.0|When Ken Follett wrote 'Pillars of the Earth' I was a little put off. It wasn't like anything else he'd written and to be honest it didn't sound very appealing. I'm a big fan of Ken Follett,. \\"Pillar's kept showing up in my life until I found it in a Doctor's waiting room, someone had left it. I read the first chapter and I was hooked. I turned it into the receptionest and stopped on my way home and bought a copy. When 'World without end' came out I was in the line to buy one. So when 'Fall of Giants' appeared I again was hooked on the first chapter. I prolonged reading it because I want the second book to be ready when I am, and it is. Follett is a genious! All of the footwork he puts in to write to this great depth must be phenominal. Facts are clear and concice and the human touch is ever so easy to get caught up in. Excellent read. Long, but never drags. BRAVO Ken Follett, and Thank You.

B007SGM084|5.0|My husband heard about this trilogy on a morning radio show and recommended I read it. I looked it up, read the product description, and decided that it didn't sound like \\"my kind of book.\\" Over the next few weeks, several friends mentioned it to me. A very close friend told me, \\"It's about bondage. But keep an open mind. And JUST READ IT!\\" So I downloaded it and began doing just that...<br /><br />The first few chapters of book one set the scene...naive, bookish girl meets attractive, billionaire CEO and lust ensues. The rest of book one was sex. Explicit sex. And at first it was \\"steamy.\\" But I quickly found myself wondering when it would end. I read it all, though in reality, I could have skipped entire chapters and really missed nothing.<br /><br />Books two and three got more into the actual story line and made me glad I stuck with it. I quickly realized that the descriptive sex scenes in book one were necessary to fully develop the two main characters. On the exterior, Christian is a powerful, worldly man but through his interactions with Anastasia, the reader begins to see his immaturity and \\"damaged\\" side. And Anastasia's oblivion over the fact that every eligible bachelor in her life is fawning over her betrays her presentation of herself as an ordinary, bumbling recent college grad. It was exciting to see the evolution of Christian and Anastasia throughout the trilogy.<br /><br />To say that this is \\"a book about bondage\\" is wrong. Yes, there are a few select scenes that depict sex with restraints or spankings or floggers. But in the grand scheme of things, they were isolated, fleeting events. Instead, I would say this book is a love story. It's about the concessions we will make for the one we love and the \\"hard limits\\" that keep us true to ourselves. The author has created two very memorable main characters and a laundry list of amazing supporting characters, including \\"the inner goddess\\" who honestly was one of my favorites! And I especially liked the last chapter (following the epilogue) which was told from Christian's perspective. I would have liked to have had more of his point of view sprinkled throughout the books.<br /><br />What's interesting to me is that these books have received such a wide array of ratings by Amazon users. Clearly the author has done her job of presenting a controversial theme and getting readers talking. I notice a few unifying comments from the reviewers who did not like the book (or gave it a low rating)....<br /><br />1) The ebook is too expensive. - To this I say that it's unfair of readers to low ball their rating of the author's work simply because they're unhappy with the publisher's price. As a consumer, you have the option to buy or not to buy. You also have the option to buy hard copies rather than ebooks. If you don't want to shell out the extra few cents to buy the trilogy instead of the three individual ebooks, then don't. If you'd rather buy the paperbacks, then do. If you'd rather borrow a friend's hard copy or check it out of the library, go for it. But don't hold that against the author!<br /><br />2) There was no story line. - To this I say, \\"You must have stopped reading at the end of book one.\\"<br /><br />3) There was too much repetition. - To this I say I think Anastasia's inner dialogue includes a lot of \\"holy crap\\" and \\"oh my\\" for a reason. Despite her personal and professional evolution, she's still a bit unsure of herself and her ability to adapt to her new lifestyle. No matter what, she's still young, naive Ana on the inside.ast chapter (following the epilogue) which was told from Christian's perspective.

B003F3FJQO|5.0|When I ead the maze runner, i didnt think the series could get any better, so i was hesitant on buying this book. I was wrong. It was way better than the first one. Although it was kind of demented in my mind, it wasnt anything to worry about. Really. There are these people with the Flare, a disease that drives you insanley mad and makes you look like a zombie. These re called Cranks. One of them tries to rip Thomas' nose off. Although the book is descriptive, it isnt completely graphic when it comes to the so called demented parts. If you are a parent looking at these reviews and are hesitant on it, trust me if your kid read the first book, they will be perfectly fine with this one.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Beware: this game will trap you in certain screens with the only option to exit the screen and the game is to buy something with real money... which is charged automaticly to your amazon account!!! Total scam!!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is amazing I kept looking for it but all I got was the on that was called temple run but was really just a rip off
B007ADIRDM|5.0|I was lucky and found this item at Kmart for $31.99..I love it..but PLEASE dont pay $99.99!! Its ridiculous that people are charging this much and its even more ridiculous if you are paying it!!! As long as people keep paying these outragous prices, then they will keep selling them at outragous prices!!
B0086700CM|5.0|after so many days and months waiting they finnaly put out the best game ever....TEMPLE RUN.  i cant believe they finnaly put it out......thank gosh
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The first book is interesting and very erotic in its content. Having said that I am not sure if this is the first time that this author had written a book and of course it is a trilogy, however this book could have been just written as a one book or  or at least for the most a 2 part book. I am not sure if the editor really had read all the contents or just read the summary or just the prologues. There are too many repetitive description on the sexual part and it gets to be boring. I have to skip some of the sex description as it has been described before. The best part of it is when someone tries to kill Mr. Grey or Anasthasia. Over all I think the book is really poorly written and/poorly edited. However out of the curiosity and publicity of these books I guess she made money and run.
B004LWZW24|2.0|save your money,watch poltergeist instead. insidious is an updated poltergeist clone. only reason for 2 star review is interesting dvd cover art.
0345803485|5.0|One of the the best book's ever, couldn't put in down, very interesting, Read all three volume's, very good books.
B000JMKRKC|3.0|Honestly, I didn't finish this book.  We read it for my book group, and for some reason I just couldn't get into it like I usually do.  I always read the books out of respect for the one who selected it.  I did read more than half the book, so I will most likely finish it someday...maybe.  I would rate what I read as fair...not spellbinding like some I read, but well written.
B0084IG7KC|1.0|I know it isnt out yet, but when this is correct , i dont buy this version of the movie, because in the cinemas<br />the aspect ratio is 2:35:1 and on the blu ray they switched it to 1:85:1. I hate that !!!!!!!

B004JN1D2I|2.0|I love George R.R. Martin's series \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\". I even love reading on the Kindle. However I hate having all 4 books downloaded as one. It's impossible to tell where you are and at the end of each book you have to page through all of the appendix just to get to the next book.

B0074MZSPO|4.0|First, thrilled that this album is available on 180gram vinyl! Second, this is a very promising first album from a very young act. The lead singer frankly carries the band throughout--she has some serious vocal chops--echoes early Tina Turner and sometimes Janis Joplin (to my humble ear). The backing band is capable, but they've got some work to do if they're going to keep up with the lead singer.
0345803493|5.0|Such a great read..Better than the first one. I can't wait to finish the trilogy and the movie! I definitely would recommend this to anyone that is 18 + older.
0345803485|1.0|I've read a few chapters in, and I can't see any reason to read any further.  The protagonist is completely unbelievable.  I don't care how innocent you are, if you've been living on your own at college for four years then you can't possibly be as naive as she is. This is part of a trilogy? I can't even make myself finish the first installment.  I almost decided to finish it as a sort of homework assignment, but life is short and I'm not going to waste my time on this. Don't believe the hype about this book.  Smut and trashy novels have their place, but this is just poorly-written smut/trash and, IMO, not worth wasting time and money on.
B006Z7Z3R2|1.0|At a small haunted New England hotel, it's almost time to close up for the season. There are two employees left who both are ghost hunters and they try to solve the mystery of the hauntings. There are only a few guest one is a fading actress who is actually played by an actress that hasn't been seen in a movie for quite some time, Kelly McGillis. The other is a mother and son who left because the female workers hears something and rushes downstairs in her underwear. The movie is very, very, slow paced and nothing really happens. It's not the trailer they promoted for the films limited release.<br /><br />Overall, aside from a few blue words and a suicide, this movie can pass as a PG film. I watched it for an hour and eleven minutes and nothing happened at all. It was boring, i'll admit I did fast foward thru most of the last thirty minutes do to boredom. I'd avoid this stinker and go watch Open Season instead.

B0040UAYI4|4.0|Firstly, I didn't buy my EagleEye from Amazon, but I hope my information helps people get a great device.<br /><br />Minor issues, cable is attached and would've been better with a removable mini USB B, it makes reconfiguration finicky if you need the cable hidden from children! The ingame sensitivity adjustment gave me a bit of a weird issue for Y-axis, but I tweaked it in the program and it was fine.<br /><br />Reason for buying. I had an original FragFX that I had to replace due to Sony's 3.5 firmware update. I \\"upgraded\\" to the Dual FragFX Pro and I was NEVER really happy with it, specifically the battery life being ridiculously bad. No way to get a refund through Amazon after 30 days, which was less than the time Splitfish took to get back to me about my battery issue. I then started having major issues with the left stick's accuracy, so I tried contacting Splitfish back at the start of April '12. As of today (May 29th 2012), I still have had no response.<br /><br />Now, good points. This thing is amazing. I have my Logitech Wave Keyboard on a USB switch (so I can switch between PC and EagleEye) along with my MX510 attached to this device and it works sooooo good. If you want a proper FPS device for your PS3, then seriously go for this. It may work out more expensive than all in one solutions as you need a keyboard and mouse for it, but if you have them lying gathering dust, then blow 'em off and buy one of these for proper fraggin' action!
B005RAO0GS|5.0|I really liked her first album, \\"Lungs,\\" but this second effort is better than the first!  I LOVE this album, and I don't say that about every artist.  There is not a bad or boring song on this whole album - rather, every song is better than the one before it!  They all flow and go together in a really arresting, captivating way.  This is definitely a slightly different sound, but I think it is much more musically complex, and it only builds on the unique synthesis of influences and sounds that is Florence. It has a slightly jazzy feel sometimes, and the sounds all twist and layer together so that you can listen a million times and never catch all the melodic complexities.  The lyrics are really beautiful in these, too.  Buy this album!!  Buy it full-price (even if you're cheap like me), buy it all, buy it now, and play it on repeat.  You will not be disappointed.  My favorite is \\"What the Water Gave Me,\\" but don't take my word for it - go find your own, if you can choose only one!

1451648537|5.0|Four months are about to be complete since I read this book on Steve Jobs. I have an extensive interest in Technology and have also been part of it retail primetime. I have never messed with developing or creating any sort of a product but yet this book seemed relevant to my cause, to my interest, to my motivation.<br />Before I begin saying anything about Jobs himself, I would like to take a moment to appreciate just how clear, well thought, concise yet gallant and gigantic in research, Walter Isaacson's account is. I don't for a minute think anybody in the world would consider it a waste of time reading such an elusive story about one of the most unique people that have ever lived and fought their way up. Walter Isaacson shows a very finite and astute understanding of the human condition, the human emotion and people in general. Writing is an incredible art and a writer's way of explicating reason is more stoic than any film that can be made or any documentary that shall be made in years to come. There is so much I have learned from his style of writing alone. The dedication is remarkable and the entire voice of the book is like that of the only professor I probably liked in college. Yes, that is how great Walter I. is<br /><br />The book begins by telling the reader about how Jobs was born. His foundation, his early years, the profession of his parents, the formation of Apple computers, several interesting facts, Steve Jobs was ruthless and not your average Ari Gold. It is detrimental to his character's complicity to understand how he rose in ranks, how he got the better of people during his walks, I laughed a lot when the REALITY DISTORTION FIELD was mentioned. \\"You know when the first mac team in 1983 went off on a retreat they asked Steve Jobs if they should do market research. Jobs said how would people know what they want until we've shown them. We should know what's on the page before they read it.  If you asked Henry Ford the same question, he'd expect people to say they wanted a faster horse instead of a car. He really felt they should be guided by the gut. He was a very sharp business person and in the end your gut and intuition is all guided by the empirical data available. He started with his own feeling of what he wants. It was the petulance and the impatience driven by a passion for the product that made it work for him. Sometimes this would mean he was impatient with the people because he wanted the product to be perfect.\\"<br /><br />Jobs made a lot of correct decisions and in my opinion there was not one single person he didn't fight with and had a fall out with. This doesn't mean he was rude or cynical or a bit of a scrooge. This will perhaps explain his passion and zeal for creating technology. Microsoft recently released Windows 8 and though it's a good operating system, it will never fight with Apple because Apple spent a lot of time diversifying and riff raffing. Most companies tend to sink when they try too much and are on a limited budget but Apple came a long way before actually landing up in the situation they are today. Walter Isaacson explains how Steve Job's end-to-end model actually wokred while Windows \\"Quick Buck\\" resolve didn't earn them more than a few decades. Jobs also had advice for \\"Google\\" , he also had advise for the American President when he forewarned Obama on a one year presidency, it will make for an incredible read. Steve Jobs learned a few things from his parents, something that would go a long way in how Apple would make their computers. A very intricate book no matter who you are. This is a great read and may also be a good gift to yourself.ple to say they wanted a faster horse instead of a car. He really felt they should be guided by the gut.

B0086700CM|5.0|fun game, finally its here for kindle, finally... what idiots gave it 1 star? i love this game, first there was temple ruin, then it was temple rum... now its temple run...
0439023521|4.0|So I didn't want to watch the film when it was out because I wanted to read the book because a lot of people had asked me to read it. I think the most interesting thing about The Hunger Games is the central character's unpredictability, Katniss Everdeen doesn't know what she wants from who. She doesn't seem to have time to think and one after another a series of unexpected events take place. At the end of every chapter the author tries to keep it very interesting by pushing forward a kind of a suspense. This is a FAST PACED READ and you shall not take long to finish the book. The writing is good but everything is mentioned in an autonomous autobiographical voice - in other words she - the protagonist - is giving an account of everything around her. I am a slow reader but I finished this book in one day so you can imagine just how catchy it's content is. A lotta credit to the author for making the wonderful mockingjays and the jabberjays and pulling that out of thin air and who can forget the mitts with the eyes!?! Unquestionably intelligent writing.
B005USZML4|4.0|It is really an enjoyable fast reading book.  I loved the first one and this is just a continuation.  A definite change from his normal writing. Very refreshing
0345803485|1.0|This author has a great publicist. There has been so much publicity about this book that I thought there must be some worth in reading it.<br />The book is so poorly written and many parts of it had me laughing, it was so ridiculous. What does this say about our country that this book  series is number 1, 2 and 3 on the N.Y. Times best seller list? I did read it to the end as I thought there might be some redeeming part at the end but to my disappointment there was none. This author is making a fortune out of this trash. I am not against sex in a novel if it is a good novel but the sex was the entire point of the novel. What frightens me is that so many young women love this book which condones and even glorifies violent sex and S & M.  The repetition of the same or similar scene over and over is tedious as well as the constant \\"Oh, my\\" and \\"Holy crap.\\" Really? Can't the author have come up with a few more phrases?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is fun and lots of different various games to chose from. some are hard andbsome are easy overall it is a fun and great game to play
B0086700CM|5.0|I introduced this to my friend and she was addicted 5 minutes later, as I was myself. I give this game two thumbs up. couldn't think of a better app to keep me busy!
B0016OLC5Q|1.0|Another Hollywood liberal movie that glorifies a kid who protests money and society by going out and killing himself and ruining his family in the meantime. I hated this movie and thought it wasn't artistic or had an good moral. The kid despises society and burns all of his money just to end up working at McDonalds to get enough money to  go to Alaska to die. I felt bad for his family. Too bad they had such a runt as a kid. Don't glorify him people, he did nothing noble or worthy, just forgot to take his ADHD meds.
B0031TZ8TU|3.0|This was a puff piece for Ross Perot. It did become<br />interesting and tense because of the work they were all doing.  Maria
B000B8QG22|4.0|While the humour of Williams is extremely funny in this film, it is not a accurate depiction of the real Adrian Cronauer. To be fair the film does not claim to be a factual biography and does tell a good story about different cultures and war. However, I think the crowning achievement of the film comes toward the end when Williams queues up Louis Armstong's \\"What A Wonderful World\\" and we listen to Satchmo sing while we witness a montage of war scenes. It is perhaps some of the most powerful moments of film Hollywood has ever produced and the film is worth owning for that footage alone.

B0053O89WY|5.0|Last week I had my girlfriend, her twin and her twin sister's ex boyfriend stay with me for 5 days we decided to watch the 1st disc of season 1 on the final night they were here and fell in love with it so much I picked up seasons 1-4 that Thursday
B007IXWL2C|5.0|These Books ARE AMAZING!!!! I love how completely real and unreal it is all together. This woman knows what she's doing and even if you say you hate them and their wrong you know your just as turned on as everyone else!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0345803485|5.0|This was one of the best book series I have ever read!!!! I completed all 3 books in one weekend. I couldn't put them down. I had to know what was going to happen next. Cant wait to see what the author's next book will be about!!!
0345803507|1.0|Abuse whether physical, emotional or sexual is not romantic. What a distorted view of romance. Are people seriously reading this? It's astonishing that these books are so popular when the story is about a misogynistic, narcissistic excuse for a man. Ana is just plain pathetic. She could have found a man much better than Christian. What a waste of time.
B004SKJTY6|1.0|This is not the movie; it's just some 5-minute review.  Yeah, I know this is free for Prime users, but the feeling of being fooled is bad enough for a one-star rating.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|50 Shades Freed is by the best book of the 50 Shades Trilogy.  Ana and Christian have just recently married and the book begins with them on their honey moon.  Going from there, they are hit with so many life changing events. We get to learn what happens to Jack Hyde after his harrassment of Ana therfore resulting in his termination from SIP.  Also we find out if Christian was truly able to fight his past demons. And finally we get to see what happens with Christian and Ana.  Do they stay together or split apart because of his past?  All I can say is I couldn't stop reading this book just as I couldn't stop reading the others.  I wasnt too fond of the very end.  I quite enjoyed the epilogue but after that it was ok. If you loved 50 Shades of Grey and 50 Shades Darker, than you will love 50 Shades Freed.  To find out what happens with Christian and Ana and to see if Christian can finally face his past demons,  then  definietly read it!  I hope E.L.  James is plannig to continue her story about Christian and Ana because I really loved this book.  Enjoy.

B0022Q8CSC|5.0|It was almost word for word as the movie. but it had a lot of new parts that did not make it in the movie as will . the only thing I did not like was the beginning of the book . it took for ever to get to the book itself. so skip that part but all in all it was great  the ending of the book left you hanging. That s why the movies made more than this one .

1451648537|2.0|Before he died, Jobs invented a new form of proctological surgery to have Isacson's nose removed from his butt.<br />By way of preface, I attempted to read Isacson's biography of Einstein, and the book was totally unreadable. The same for his Benjamin Franklin. Jobs must have chosen Isacson, not for his writing ability (or lack thereof). Rather, my guess is that Jobs picked  him for his sway with the media  establishment and his ability to sell the Joe Scarboroughs of the world with the bogus idea that Jobs was something other than a greedy, unpleasant a-hole.<br />Isacson tries his best, but Isacson is insufficiently skilled at lying to carry out his charge. Since I am posting this on barnesandnoble, i am defeating my best interests by giving my real feelings. I should have done a \\"Jobs\\" and said that it's a great book so that I could get my money back on the resale.

Ultimately this book is doctrine of science garbage.

B0086700CM|5.0|it is about time they make this app for kindle fire but thanks to whoever made this app I have been waiting for this
0345803485|4.0|It's true... You won't be able to put this book down.<br /><br />I do not agree that the writing is poor, in fact, in some places it's quite clever... I noticed something which I wondered if others had seen, and when I discussed it with others who had read the book, they hadn't.  It was clever, and well done.  I'm not sharing so as not to spoil for anyone.<br /><br />However:  the writing is redundant.... There are phrases that are awkward and used over, and over, and over again.  \\"my breath hitched,\\" for example.  And, the storyline at times feels like a looped news clip playing again and again.<br /><br />However:  there is something about these totally damaged characters which makes you want to find out more about them.<br /><br />I read books one and two in three days, and purposely did not begin book three, since I needed to get some things done!<br /><br />Enjoy!  This is definitely a TRIP!
B0064NTZQ2|4.0|Ok, before this movie i had never HEARD of Ryan Gosling and I had never seen any of his movies. I had heard of this movie before in passing, none of my friends had seen it but when i watched it i was going in nearly blind. So when i watched this i never expected it to be this good, i love the character arc with our protagonist. he goes from a quiet almost pacifistic man to a hell bent vigilante in a second, which i believe adds to how much he truly loves his love interest it shows that he really wants to protect her and is willing to break his own code to save his life and hers. Another thing that really sets this movie apart is its amazing score, the very 80s beats and tunes romanticize the world it illustrates. This movie actually got me to read the book, which is different, but i like what they did with the plot; making the character more sympathetic and putting more emphasis on the romance
B005Y423ZC|4.0|Excellent in every area except for the profanity between songs (my students love Adele but I have to careful showing them the DVD-I do however, play the included CD, which skips all the banter between songs).<br /><br />I've always liked Adele's live version of all her songs better than the studio version. They're generally slower and more emphatic.<br /><br />The audience singing along is pretty cool, and obviously affects Adele.<br /><br />As others have said, it's so nice to see a real, talented singer (unlike the hideous Gaga) who can sing acapella, or with just a piano-amazing, the power and feeling in her voice. The words aren't bad either-the first time I played \\"Someone like you\\" for my girlfriend (before it was being played on the radio) she started crying and it kind of blew me away!<br /><br />It's cool that you get the DVD and CD.<br /><br />I hate to take a star away...

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I've bought many books through Kindle, but this is the first book that was so good I had to recommend it to others. Eric Blehm does an outstanding job telling the story of a strong-willed and devoted man of our nation's warrior class. This is a great book!!!!!!!!!!!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wow. I'm at a loss of words. This was amazing. When I first finished it, I thought it was a bit disturbing, but after reading the second and eventually third book, I fell in love with the series. I immediatly went and saw the movie. The best possible actors are in it. It couldn't have been better. I'm trying to persuade my mom to take me to the movie again :) What I recommend: Read the first book. Give it a couple of days to sink in. Go find the second and third books. Do not start reading the second book unless you have the thid right next to you. Read and enjoy. Go see the movie ASAP. Go see the movie again. Watch the movie one more time. Reread the series twice. Become obsessed. NEVER read any of the parodies. Meet Suzanne Collins. Take up archery lessons. Become amazing at archery. Find out where it is and move to District 12. Name your children after the characters. Hunt with a bow and arrow. Learn how to make Katniss's favorite dish properly. Never ever stray away from the Hunger Games or I will come find you and annoy you until you promise to stay with the Hunger Games for the rest of your life. Do all of this and you will have a wonderful amazing life :)<br /><br />Hunger Games<br />Katniss+Peeta=Love<br />Katniss+Gale=Kisses<br /><br />GO HUNGER GAMES!!!!!!!!
B007HO392S|4.0|I wouldn't call myself a country fan, but thought I'd check this album out.  It surpassed my expectations.  I hadn't heard \\"Good Girl\\" on the radio so every song was completely new to me.  I am no music expert to be able to critique the instruments, voice, etc, but I can say as a casual music fan this album is very catchy and I haven't gotten sick of it yet.  I've spent a few days listening to it 8 continuous hours at work.  There's a good mix of fast/slow, serious/light hearted songs.  If you've ever liked a Carrie song, you'll find something on here worth listening to.
0345803485|1.0|A Black and White Choice NOT to Read \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\"    Posted on 06.05.12 by Mary Kassian      While we don't want to re-open a can of worms, we think this post by Mary gives some helpful input on the subject of this larger-than-life publishing phenomenon.    Fifty Shades of Grey, an erotic novel by an obscure British author based on Stephanie Meyer's Twilight series, has electrified women across the country. Readers have spread the word like wildfire on Facebook pages, in college hallways, at office functions, and in spin classes. Within six weeks of publication, the three books of the series, Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker, and Fifty Shades Freed, claimed the top three spots in USA Today's Best-Selling Books list. Sales have topped 10 million. The series is so popular that last month, author E. L. James was listed as one of Time magazine's \\"100 Most Influential People in the World.\\"    Red Room of Pain    The books in question are erotica that explicitly describe sexual bondage, discipline, sadism, and masochism (BDSM). The story follows an unfolding affair between a recent college graduate, the virgin Anastasia Steele, and handsome young billionaire entrepreneur, Christian Grey, whose childhood abuse left him a deeply damaged individual, and who enlists her to share his secret sexual proclivities. Steele is required by Grey to sign a contract allowing him complete control over her. Because of her fascination and budding love for him, she consents to a kinky sexual relationship that includes being slapped, spanked, handcuffed, and whipped with a leather riding crop in his \\"Red Room of Pain.\\"    A few weeks ago, the book popped up as Amazon's suggested buy on my Kindle. I declined. Like my friend, Dannah Gresh, I absolutely refuse to read these books.    Smut is Smut    Undoubtedly, the series portrays BDSM in the context of an engaging, passionate, tender, romantic relationship that culminates in the characters falling in love, and the conflicted girl assuaging the billionaire's troubled soul. But it doesn't matter to me how the author sweetens it up. The tasty red Kool-Aid doesn't offset the bitter poison. Smut is still smut.    I don't have to read the book to know that it's bad for women. Nor do I need to read it to tell you that I think it would be unwise for you to read it.    Seven Reasons Not to Read Fifty Shades    1. It violates God's design for sex.    God created sex to be exclusive to marriage. In Fifty Shades, the relationship is based on a sex contract, not a marriage contract. The Lord says that sex outside of marriage is sin. It grieves Christ when we take pleasure in something He abhors.    2. It violates the biblical concept of authority.    The relationship between a man and wife is to mirror Christ's relationship to His Bride. BDSM tells a lie about the nature of that relationship. Christ taught and modeled that authority is for the purpose of loving service. It is not an egotistical power trip. Christ is not into domination, control, abuse, and humiliation. So in my mind, there's something seriously wrong when we get a kick out of interpersonal domination/humiliation, and bring BDSM into Christian bedrooms.    3. It violates the biblical concept of submission.    A wife's submission is first and foremost to Christ. The biblical directive to submit does not turn women into brain-dead, passive, weak-willed doormats who acquiesce to the whims of dominant, controlling men. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Lord doesn't want His daughters to be wilting, weak-willed, wimpy women who welcome and enjoy abuse. BDSM perverts and mocks the beauty of what true submission is all about.    4. It encourages the sin of sensuality.    Erotica is a genre that aims to arouse sexual desire. It evokes sensuality, a sin that appears in numerous New Testament lists of vices (Gal. 5:19, Rom. 13:13, Mark 7:21-23, 1 Pet. 4:3, 2 Cor. 12:21). Sensuality is anything that:      is characterized by lust,expresses lewdness or lust,    tends to excite lust.    Scripture tells us to flee all such things.    5. It promotes sexual perversion.    \\"Curiosity\\" has led to the downfall of multitudes who have been trapped in the destructive, downward vortex of sexual sin. Fifty Shades piques curiosity. It dangles behaviors that are forbidden, unfamiliar, and titillating. Maybe you're just curious, or maybe you rationalize that it might boost your libido and marital sex life. And it might. Temporarily. But the problem with erotica, as with porn, is that you'll end up craving increasingly graphic, perverse images over time. Erotica/porn lead to deeper, darker erotica/porn. What's more, they end up robbing people of the joy and satisfaction of \\"ordinary,\\" non-twisted sex with an \\"ordinary\\" spouse. In the end, they assault and diminish a healthy sex life.    6. It glamorizes pathological relationships.    The male protagonist is a very tortured and misunderstood soul with a proclivity for sexual perversion. One moment he is abusive, and the next he is tender and romantic. The girl feels she is the only one who can reach him and help him. Hmmm. Sounds like a seriously dysfunctional co-dependent abusive relationship to me. As Dr. Pinksy, a relationship expert said, \\"the idea that women look at this relationship as anything other than absolute, categorical, profound pathology is more than I can imagine . . . I worry about the fifteen-year-olds and nineteen-year-olds reading this and formulating a notion that this is anything close to a reasonable relationship.\\"    7. You won't get it out of your head.    The Bible tells us to think about things that are pure, right, excellent, praiseworthy, lovely, admirable, noble, and true (Phil. 4:8). There's truth to the old proverb that \\"as a man thinketh so is he,\\" and the modern day adage, \\"garbage in-garbage out.\\" Your thoughts have transformational power-for good or for evil. Filling your head with thoughts of sin, sensuality, dysfunction, and BDSM will lead you further away from the things of God and not closer to them. Darkness has incredible \\"sticking power.\\" Once exposed, it can be extremely difficult to get the images and thoughts out of your head.    As Dannah Gresh says,      \\"God has given me more than fifty shades of truth in His Word and when just one of them is in conflict with my entertainment choices, I choose to pass! To be clear: I wouldn't drive my Envoy into the front of an oncoming semi-truck any more than I would open the pages of Fifty Shades of Grey. I love my marriage, my God, and myself too much.\\"    So girls, have some respect for the Lord, and for yourselves. Exercise some discernment, and don't read this book!    In my opinion, the choice whether or not to read Fifty Shades of Grey is pretty black and white.    *For Dana's Review go to [....]
B007SGM084|5.0|What kind of reviews are these I read here, if you don't like the price simply don't buy it. I bought the trilogy and loved it, couldn't put the book down and was sad it was over when i finished.

0345803485|5.0|After a trip with a friend to the bookstore & seeing her get all excited about this book, I knew I had to have it also, but I couldn't justify the bookstore price!  When I found it for almost half price on amazon, I immediately bought it!  Came nicely packaged, not bent or messed up in anyway!<br />The book- wow!  A bit saucy, but def an easy read!  Def. recommend but be read to blush throughout while reading!  I think this book will cause another baby boom;)
0345803485|1.0|These books are terribly written.  I can't believe I wasted a weekend reading this trash.  The grammar was inconsistent and would sometimes sound like something out of the 1800's.  The main character, Anna, is a pathetic, sad little girl.  After reading that these books derived from the Twilight series, I'm really not surprised.  I would recommend that anyone with half a brain and a taste for intellectual reading stay far away from these books.

B00729GQ0A|4.0|I couldn't help but notice The Forever Girl storming the blogosphere and getting excellent reviews.  I also follow Rebecca on Twitter and was impressed by her marketing campaign, so of course I had to see what all the fuss was about for myself.<br /><br />First off, this is a beautifully written book. Hamilton's descriptions of Sophia's Wiccan rituals brought the story to life and I was fascinated reading all the passages involving spells.<br /><br />So, on to the story: 22 year Goth girl and Wiccan Sophia Parsons sticks out in her small Rocky Mountain town in Colorado.  No one's hiring history teachers in this economy so she waits tables at a local café where everyone in town can stare at her strange clothes and whisper behind her back.  Her mother is a nut and belongs to a church that sounds more like an occult than any legitimate religious organisation. The head of the church, Mrs. Franklin wants Sophia out of the house she inherited from her grandfather and uses threats and condemnation as an incentive to force Sophia to leave.  In the midst of this, Sophia is trying her best to live with the whispering voices in her head and she discovers that Cruors (vampire-like beings) and other elemental creatures exist.<br /><br />I initially thought this was a YA novel (a genre I read a lot) so I was pleasantly surprised to spend time with a slightly older protagonist.  Sophie is a very down-to-earth and normal young woman, someone I could relate to for the most part, despite her getting caught up in a mysterious and dangerous supernatural world.  I did, however find Charles' and Sophia's relationship at the start to be a strange one.  They're adults and discuss moving in together, having spent every day in each other's company for months, yet all they have shared are a few kisses.  I found this hard to believe given the fact that Charles has been around for a few hundred years and Sophia is a recent college grad.  This is the one element of the story that made me feel Iwas reading a YA novel about teenagers.<br /><br />Sophia's independent nature laced with vulnerability kept me turning the pages.  She lives alone in her grandfather's house and remains strong and determined despite the abuse from the deranged Mrs. Franklin and threat from the powerful, supernatural Council.  I liked the mythology of The Forever Girl.  Vampires are called Cruors in this story, and there are different kinds of elemental beings and half breeds. Her family line can be traced back to the time of the Salem Witch trials, and gradually Sophia and those around her come to realise that she may also have some witch blood in her.<br /><br />I loved the author's writing style. Every detail, every description painted Sophia's world in vibrant colours and I was with her every step of the way. I'll be keeping an eye out for the next book in the series.

1451683405|1.0|Any logical & rational argument that leads to the conclusion that there is no human freewill is in error at it's core. The very methodologies in logic & rationality require freewill and deduction to come to a conclusion in truth that is free from the constraints that a mere deterministic mind creates. How does one know they are' not determined to be wrong or even on the right path of real truth-seeking if freewill is merely biochemical illusion? Either one is logical and rational with freewill or illogical & irrational without freewill of choice! I believe in human freewill as in all justice systems past & present; that one is culpable for ones actions because they actually have choice that is free from the constraints of a mere biochemical body reacting to it's external world; that the soul is this free agent reining over the body, that allows for freewill in human choice to be more than illusory. Science may discover what we are within our limited and bound five senses within this world but science can never inform us of who we are as individuals. I have never seen such critically detailed accounts as to what is evil is and entails than the Atheist that posits moralities as merely subjective opinion and evil a meaningless word otherwise. I find it ironic that the very Atheist that demands freedom from such religions of \\"deplorable\\" gods denies that he, himself has such freewill in order to do so!<br /><br />~Wg Williams<br />  JAX, FL
B005SV9X22|4.0|I am a fan of her songs and of what she stands for. I have to say i felt like I was at the concert when I watched it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I got curious like everyone else.  Wondered what on earth is everyone talking about??  I can see what would make people interested...but, if this chick says \\"Holy Cow, Holy Crap, Holy ANYTHING\\" one more time, I will puke. I understand that she isn't experienced and that he can be overwhelming, but, can this girl, (young woman, really) express herself in any mature manner??<br /><br />Christian is interesting.  He's warped, but it seems like he is trying, in his own strange way to come out of his own box.  He states he doesn't do the girlfriend thing, that he doesn't sleep with his subs, but he takes exception to her because of her innocence.  Strangely, that is touching.  What does get to me, however, is that it seems that regardless of Christian's insistance that he doesn't want to infringe on her free will, he stalks her, he imposes himself on her, and while he will say he will give her space and time, he really doesn't.  And, because he is so powerful, it makes me believe that those who support her would have no say in protecting her because money talks.  That part, I don't really like.<br /><br />Part of me thinks that the price should be lowered because of this childishness, but, I'll admit, I am curious enough to complete the trilogy.  Maybe not right away, but that is the beauty of owning a Kindle.  There will always be a copy in the store when I'm ready to read the next excerpt (I may, however, read a few things in between before I embark on the \\"Holy Cow\\" road again).

1439127700|5.0|\\"The Presidents Club\\" is an excellent book.  As an avid non-fiction reader I found this book to be highly readable and enjoyable.  The main thing I learned was that dirty politics and friction between political parties and individuals has been around for a long time - and not just in our recent history.  From Hoover, Truman, Eisenhower and forward there's been a lot of bad mouthing and dirty tricks between the candidates.  However, I find it pleasantly surprising that former Presidents do get along, sometimes very much so, Clinton and Bush \\"41\\" are a great example.  And I found it interesting that current Presidents do forgo their ego and consult with their predecessors.<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"The Presidents Club\\" for anyone who is interested in presidential history.

B007OWG3LM|5.0|VALTARI is a return to form for Sigur R&oacute;s.  After seemingly lost their way with their last album and side projects, VALTARI is a return to the ambient art rock of the band's earlier albums.  This collection of 8 songs is what you would expect with most Sigur Ros releases: slow-burning, atmospheric, and above all else, beautiful.<br /><br />The most interesting turn with this release is how comfortable the band feels with itself.  The album has a lived-in, warm, confident feel: many moments on VALTARI are marked with electronic flitters, the sound of crackling vinyl, and asynchronous violin flares.  This feels like a far cry from 2008's [[ASIN:B001ACY8D2 Med Sud I Eyrum Vid Spilum Endalaust]] which found the band attempting to become a bit more accessible.  Instead, the band takes the time to let these songs flesh themselves out -- these songs lack structure and convention, but they never feel rushed or overwrought for emotion.  Not an instrument feels out of place here; the violins, electronic noises, pianos, all feel perfectly assembled.<br /><br />Fans of the band have come to expect epic crescendos from the band: nine minute songs that end in a flurry of distortion and percussion.  This hallmark is largely missing from VALTARI (the exception here being the third song on the album, \\"Var&uacute;ð\\") and instead, the album defies expectations and gives the listener a quiet, bare ending.  The album ends in a wonderful decrescendo, starting with \\"Varðeldur\\" and continuing until the very end.  This three-song-long fading out works beautifully to end the album.  It's both beautiful and haunting, but what is truly great about VALTARI is that these songs will evoke different images to different listeners.<br /><br />I would recommend this album highly to anyone is a fan of the band's previous work, [[ASIN:B0000DJYME Explosions in the Sky]], or avant-garde/art rock; this release is well worth its price.  Recommended sampling:  Honestly, I would almost warn against sampling this album because listening to one song out of context is like reading a random chapter of a book.  It works best as a coherent whole.  With that disclaimer, the best place to start is probably \\"[[ASIN:B0084P92G6 Var&uacute;ð]]\\".  Alternatively, for newbies of the band, I would recommend albums \\"[[ASIN:B00006LLNU ( )]]\\" or \\"[[ASIN:B000W1TIN2 Takk...]]\\" as great starting points.s album because listening to one song out of context is like reading a random chapter of a book.

B007MDQW3W|5.0|Regina Spektor's last album, 2009's [[ASIN:B002COTI64 Far]], found the singer-songwriter at her most accessible.  This move seemed to put off long-time fans; Spektor's appeal before finding her way to VH1 was her offkilter songwriting.  With WHAT WE SAW FROM THE CHEAP SEATS, Spektor has returned to the fun, strange songwriting that initially brought her into the spotlight.  This album was produced by Mike Elizondo (who also worked on FAR): perhaps most well known for taking Fiona Apple's EXTRAORDINARY MACHINE and giving it a streamlined and focused spin.<br /><br />WHAT WE SAW FROM THE CHEAP SEATS is hard to predict.  Not only do songs range in tempo, tone, and mood from one song to the next, these shifts can happen mid-song (notably in the album opener \\"Small Town Moon.\\")  Listeners can, however, expect the impulse-driven piano pop that mixes blends of genre, nonsense, and convention.  The changes in style never feel like Spektor is aping a genre or playing the chameleon; instead, it feels as if Spektor's imagination is running wild in the studio.  The result is an interesting, fun album.<br /><br />The opening \\"Small Town Moon\\" begins as a conventional piano pop song, but it soon gives way to typical Spektor mannerisms (starts, stops, repetition, etc...) before ultimately opening up into a stomping chant of \\"Everybody not so nice, nice.\\"  It's hard to really describe it, but it's great fun to experience.  \\"Oh Marcello\\" is similar in its unpredictability, ranging from wild falsettos to beatboxing from Spektor.  This is followed by \\"Don't Leave Me (Ne Me Quitte Pas),\\" a song that incorporates hints of tropical music with horns and a Russian chorus.  Not all of the songs on the album are quite so wild; \\"Firewood\\" is a simple, soulful song composed Spektor's piano and a drumset -- it makes for one of the most inspired passes of Spektor's lyricism.  The only real problem I have with CHEAP SEATS is that it feels scattershot.  Some of the songs feel less developed than others (compare \\"All the Rowboats\\" to \\"Ballad of a Politician,\\" for example).  While the album gets a strong start, the Beatles-esque closer, \\"Jessica\\" doesn't quite feel like a good way to wrap up the album.<br /><br />Recommended sampling: \\"Small Town Moon,\\" \\"All the Rowboats,\\" and \\"Oh Marcello\\".  Fans of [[ASIN:B000B0WOEO Fiona Apple]] and [[ASIN:B000V9D0XY Feist]] will probably find a lot to like here.  If you like any of Spektor's previous releases, this album is worth you time and money.<br /><br />ADDITIONAL RELEASE INFO:  A deluxe edition of WHAT WE SAW FROM THE CHEAP SEATS was released.  If contains three songs that didn't make it onto the album.  These songs are: [[ASIN:B0082JYGHE Call Them Brothers (feat. Only Son)]], [[ASIN:B0082JYGUQ Old Jacket (Stariy Pidjak)]], and [[ASIN:B0082JYGN8 The Prayer Of François Villon (Molitva)]].  These songs are good, but \\"Call Them Brothers\\" rises above the rest and is definitely worth seeking out.  The other two are covers of Russian songs; they feature Spektor alone with her piano.thers (compare \\"All the Rowboats\\" to \\"Ballad of a Politician,\\" for example).

B0067FGYGQ|4.0|Sharon Van Etten's 2012 TRAMP is sad, but it's not depressing.  Many of the songs here are filled with melancholy, but there's also something hopeful about them (particularly in \\"All I Can.\\")  The album is a good blend of atmospheric, bluesy guitar-driven rock and autobiographical \\"heart-on-my-sleeve\\" lyrics.  After listening to this album a few times, I felt like I knew SVE.  TRAMP is full of passion, and it shows.  The album begins with one of its best feet forward (\\"Warsaw,\\") but the latter half of the album does not feel quite as strong as the first.<br /><br />This album wasn't made to listen to in the background; doing so will give the listener the false idea that all of these tracks sound alike.  Many of the songs do have similar moods, but they are packed with detail and intricate instrumentation. There's not a note that doesn't feel deserved or planned.  These songs are driven by mood, and unfortunately, I think that this album might have a hard time finding a larger crowd. That's not to say that the album isn't accessible; it just isn't full of hooks or melodies that would draw in the casual top 40 crowd.<br /><br />Fans of [[ASIN:B004LW8Y60 Wye Oak]], [[ASIN:B000W1PXKE PJ Harvey]], [[ASIN:B005JG2YRW St. Vincent]], or [[ASIN:B000S5BXAS Mark Lanegan]] will find a lot to like in this bluesy, guitar-driven album.  Recommended highlights for sampling: \\"Warsaw,\\" \\"Serpents,\\" \\"All I Can,\\" and \\"Magic Chords.\\"

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am not getting why there is so much hype over this book/series. I read the first of the trilogy & just cannot bring myself to throw away any more money on it & would even like the author to refund the cost of the first book. The character development was not well thought out. The story dragged & Ana's constant inner dialogue was tedious. 50 Shades of Grey really taxed my grey matter & cannot recommend this to anyone in all good consciousness.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Wow. That's all I can really say about this movie, really. It was better than I expected and then some.<br /><br />Loki, Loki, Loki. A tortured soul and such a good villain. Man he really hates his brother, Thor! Damn talk about family issues. Loki opens the portal and goes to earth to destroy it of course and Thor appears to take him home. Thor runs into Iron Man and joins S.H.I.E.L.D. to help take down Loki. Of course there's Nick Fury who brings them all together to S.H.I.E.L.D. Black Widow goes to collect the Hulk (Bruce Banner aka Bruce Krenzler) to help S.H.I.E.L.D. Iron Man joins and Captain America.  Captain America, Thor, The Incredible Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye (who was previously Loki's drone in the first half of the film) and Iron Man all join together to bring down Loki and his alien drones from destroying earth. The humor was better in the movie (thanks to Joss Whedon), the action was awesome, and the story was better. A must see for all. The after credits spot sets it up for the future Marvel Sequels (I hope)- Captain America 2, Iron Man 3, and Thor 2. Nick Fury is rumored to have his own movie but we'll see. No plans as of yet to give the Incredible Hulk ANOTHER movie.

B0021L8V1Q|5.0|I was weary about the sequel for Iron Man but it turned out to be a pretty decent sequel. Justin Theroux's script was well written and the visual effects were astounding. Stay after the credits for a lead in to another of the Marvel Universe movies.<br /><br />The plot was decent. Tony Stark needs to find another element than palladium to keep him alive. The palladium in his chest piece that was keeping him alive and the shrapnel from entering his heart is slowing killing him. He hands over the company to Pepper Potts to run while he works on a way to cure his problem. He is also convinced his is going to die. Ivan Vanko, a Russian physicist previously imprisoned in Russia for selling Russian secrets, builds the Whiplash outfit to seek revenge against the Starks. Howard Stark, Tony's father, fired Ivan's father Anton and sent him back to Russia to live in exile and thus Ivan has a serious revenge issue with the Starks. Ivan goes after Tony at the Grand Prix in Monaco and destroys Tony's race car on the track and tries to kill him. Ivan is taken to prison for life in Monaco. At his birthday party, he gets drunk and destroys his house. Rhodey puts on the War Machine suit to counteract Iron Man into calming down, but they end up fighting each other and destroying Tony's house. Justin Hammer, Tony Stark's old friend and rival defense weapons dealer/manufacturer, breaks Vanko out of prison and enlists his help to build a drone army for the military with technology that rivals Iron Man's technology. Of course, the drone army is controlled by Vanko and thus goes after Iron Man. Iron Man has to team up with Rhodey's War Machine again to fight off the drones and Vanko. Natalie Rushman (aka Natalie Romanov and the Black Widow) is Pepper Potts' replacement and is under cover at Stark Industries. She evaluates Tony Stark's personality and behavior for S.H.I.E.LD. and recommends that he does not join them. Nick Fury appears and interviews Tony Stark for the Avengers Initiative.He gives Tony a copy of Natalie's report and recommends that he be a consultant only to S.H.I.E.L.D.<br /><br />The visual effects were better than the first movie. I'm looking forward to Iron Man 3.

B004JMSIRC|5.0|Jon Favreau delivers an awesome movie! A good comic book transition. Not bad for an actor.<br /><br />Jon Favreau updated the Iron Man mythology to the Iraqi War from Vietnam which makes better sense than trying to complete a period piece. The basic plot points are the same from the comic book.<br /><br />Tony Stark ironically gets injured from his own weapons and is saved by Youren, his cell mate in Afghanistan. Arab mercenaries have captured Stark and force him to build the Jericho, his ultimate weapon. Of course, he builds the Iron Man suit to fight them off and get away. Back in Malibu, California, Tony shuts down the weapons manufacture section of Stark Industries and works on perfecting the Iron Man suit. Meanwhile, his dad's friend and Tony's mentor, Obadiah Stern, goes nuts and tries to take over the company (of course). He steals the technology that keeps Stark alive and uses it to power his own Iron Man-like suit to reek havoc all over L.A. Of course Iron Man gets up and fights him off. Everyone lives happily ever after and he reveals himself to be Iron Man.<br /><br />Agent Coulson from S.H.I.E.L.D. helps Pepper Potts save Tony and assists in destroying Obadiah. Agent Coulson wanted to debrief Tony on how he escaped Afghanistan, but he never got his chance. He sets up a future appointment with Pepper Potts and exits. Nick Fury makes a post-credits appearance and tells Tony that he isn't the only superhero in the world, and tells him that he wants to talk to him about the \\"Avengers Initiative\\". Sets up future events for Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America and of course the Avengers.<br /><br />If you're going to see or have already seen the Avengers (2012), it's best if you watch Captain America, Thor, The Incredible Hulk (2008), Iron Man and Iron Man 2. It's not needed but it will make sense of things described in the plot of the Avengers.

0345803493|2.0|I'm really surprised that this book has a higher review score than the first one. I read them both, back to back, and didn't enjoy this one nearly as much as I did the prior book.<br /><br />What really irked me was how...repetitive this book was. Every other page, Ana is still referring to her \\"inner goddess,\\" or to Christian as \\"my Fifty,\\" or \\"Fifty\\" or whatever variation of \\"fifty shades\\" E.L. James can imagine. It's just bad. My personal annoyance was also all the references to her subconscious, wearing half-moon glasses. Half-moon glasses? Really? This book makes me feel like an old lady sometimes because its so clearly NOT written from the perspective of a early-twenties American girl. It's so obvious from the clothes, to the mannerisms.<br /><br />Now, don't get me wrong, I love a trashy read as much as the next girl (hence my 4-star rating of the first book), but this one just does not deliver. I found the action in this book to be really dull, the behavior of the protagonists was out-of-character and Ana was just acting like a big brat (especially when it came to her emailing Christian dirty messages from her work account after he had warned her several times not to).<br /><br />The only redeeming quality of this book was finding out more about \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" and Christian's development into who he is, but even then, it was just not as entertaining as I had hoped.<br /><br />I've got the third and final book sitting on my shelf at home but I need a break before I even attempt to pick it up again. I'm totally over Ana and Christian for the time being.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is simply one of the best reading-experiences I've had.<br />Both the world and it's inhabitants are are convincing me of being real, and the story is so fascinating, that it's hard to put the book down.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game. its a lot of fun when ur bored and makes time go by fast. best app ever

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I finally got around to reading the Hunger Games. It was a great read. It was so good that I read the whole trilogy in a week! The first and second book are very riveting, but the third book really makes it a fantastic series. Rarely do authors know how to realistically tie up all the lose ends in a novel, but she does! The main character is complex and pretty realistic although a little MaryJane-ish, but not overly so like Bella in the Twilight series. I loved Finnick's character and how he grows in this series. Peeta, Haymitch, all were fantastic. And an enemy that doesn't lie to you because he knows the truth is so very much worse than anything he could ever make-up!  And he wields it like a weapon to strike her in her heart at the best possible moments.  \\"Didn't we promise not to ever lie to each other.\\"
B004I8WD6E|4.0|I've had this casefor almost 5 months for my Verizon iPhone 4 and love everything about it except it has started to yellow in the last month.  The fit is perfect, it offers great protection when I drop my phone and it does not cause any problems for me when I dock or charge the phone.  It does allow dust to get in between the phone and case so I take it off periodically and clean both items.  I like that it's a great fit and offers protection without being showy.  It slips easily in and out of my pocket and the cover does not make it too bulky.  For the price it may be worth it to be two or three and just replace them every few months.  I have a black phone and the yellow still shows up - makes the phone look dirty.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game<br />reminds me of playing the original when I was in grade school on the old Mac computers and everyone would die of dysentary
B000UOGHKS|5.0|Although I was much too young to remember all the hoopla surrounding the 1992 release of Madonna's Sex book, I've since read up on that time in her career and wonder why those feelings of anger and disgust overshadowed her album Erotica. Now I realize what guts Madonna had to take her image in a more overtly sexual direction. Of course sex had always played a part in her persona, but she'd never taken it this far or as unapologetically before. Especially during a time where ignorance reigned supreme in terms of the lack of knowledge surrounding the AIDS virus.<br /><br />To be honest, Erotica isn't filled with imagery of whips and chains and S&M games. Far from it. It also explores the consequences of remaining in toxic relationships, the thrill in wholeheartedly giving your heart to another, and the pain of losing those closest to you. The record is also musically diverse, incorporating elements of 20's and 30's jazz, house, hip-hop, and new jack swing.<br /><br />The sinister, bass-driven title track finds the Material Girl introducing herself as Dita, a gold tooth flashing dominatrix, cracking her whip and huskily demanding \\"Give it up, do as I say/Give it up and let me have my way!\\" She'll gladly \\"hit you like a truck\\" and \\"teach you how to\\"... well, you know. Her icy delivery, mostly spoken, but sometimes sung, works perfectly backed with horn riffs sampled from Kool and the Gang's Jungle Boogie. The Peggy Lee classic Fever is set to a thumping house beat with Madonna once again casting things in a darker light. Too late to turn back now. Just do whatever she says and you'll be ok. Like taking a hike when she kicks you to the curb with the danceable Bye Bye Baby. Using a nasally, high-pitched voice, Madge gives her soon to be ex a well deserved kiss-off with the catchy chants of \\"I know I love you because I hate you\\" and a final \\"You *beep* it up!\\" Deeper and Deeper examines the odyssey of self-discovery of a young man coming to terms with his sexuality. Sounds like a downer, huh? Wrong! This little number is set to a swirling disco beat that begs you to let go and dance. \\"These feelings inside I can't explain/But my love is alive and I'm never gonna hide it again!\\" Keep an ear out for the Vogue references.<br /><br />The jazzy cool Where Life Begins is an ode to a topic that isn't exactly \\"a dining room conversation\\": Kissing... below the belt. Of course some of the lyrics are a bit laughable (\\"Now what could be better than a home cooked meal?/How you want to eat it depends on how you feel ... Colonel Sanders says it best/'It's finger lickin' good'\\"), but the song is meant to be tongue in cheek. And somewhere else apparently. Doesn't hurt that the instrumental backing is so sosphisticated, almost Sade-esque, with the sax flourishes. The melancholic ballad Bad Girl tells the heartbreaking story of a woman whose days are filled with chain smoking and booze and nights with one night stands that leave her lonely and in emotional torment. She's too ashamed and afraid to end things with the one man who truly loves her despite the pain she knows she causes him. The character meets a tragic fate in the music video. This song depresses me, but I \\"love it just the same\\".<br /><br />Moving into less sad territory is Waiting, a track about sticking with someone who isn't right for you and although you've known it since the beginning (\\"Well I know from experience/That if you have to ask for something/More than once or twice/It wasn't yours in the first place\\"), you feel like you can't leave. Motown meets hip-hop with a sick bassline and slick piano. On the flipside, Did You Do It? features rappers disclosing their sexual conquests with the insertion the chorus in Waiting. I don't care for it personally.<br /><br />Thief of Hearts sassily shuts down the antics of a cheating Jezebel who sets her sights on Madonna's man. \\"Which leg do you want me to break?\\" She'll go Detriot on a heffa if she needs to. Don't let the English accent foolya. Words reminds us that \\"actions speak louder than words\\" so watch the things you say while the reggae-tinged Why's It So Hard? (get your mind out of the gutter!) decries the racism, sexism, and homophobia that continues to permeate society. \\"Bring your love, sing your love/Wear your love, share your love\\" instead. One of the best ballads of the album, Rain celebrates a love powerful enough to wash away all previous pain and sorrow. Madonna's usually detached vocals take on the heightened anticipation for the joy she hopes is coming her way. \\"And now I'll wait for the sun!\\"<br /><br />Happiness is far from her mind on the wistful In This Life. Reflecting on the deaths of a 23 year old friend and a dance teacher/father figure, Madonna's grief is coupled with the anger over this disease and the rampant ignorance attached to it. \\"Have you ever watched your best friend die?,\\" she asks. \\"Have you ever watched a grown man cry?/Some say that life isn't fair/I say that people just don't care/They'd rather turn the other way/While we wait for this thing to go away.\\" Poignant. The confessional closer Secret Garden features Madonna doing spoken word over a chill acid jazz groove. It's here that she first speaks about wanting to be a mother and wondering where she's going in her life. An excellent way to wrap things up.<br /><br />Aside from Bedtime Stories, Erotica is the only Madonna album of new material I've checked out and I'm amazed at how well produced and musically arranged it is. It's introspective, unapologetically frank, and easy to fall in love with. The songwriting is impeccable and it's a shame Madonna's lyricism is so overlooked. Dark at times yet fun loving at others,  slightly removed yet soul stirring, Erotica is one of the best albums of the 90's I've heard. Tear down the taboos and enjoy.ya.

B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting on this app 4ever. I have on all of my other devices and I kept waiting 4 it to come on the Kindle Fire. 5 STAR!
B005LAIHPY|5.0|Absolutely loved it. Sci Fi on a big scale, sort of like Armageddon. Good cast, good story, lots of action, good music and a bit of humor thrown in. Recommend.
B007MGWBU2|3.0|It was no Jim Henson and Frank Oz or Brian Henson production.  The movie was lacking The Muppet's special touch. Watch the original movie or series.
B005LAIH2W|3.0|This movie is not bad, certainly nowhere near as bad as the box office fizzle might lead one to think.  Sure, the main actor has poor delivery and not much appeal, but the story is interesting and entertaining, the effects are pretty good and even great at times, and what more could you want of a Disney take on a sci fi story?
B0086700CM|5.0|THIS APP IS SO AMAZING I LOVE IT SO MUCH I CANT STOP PLAYING IT I PLAY IT ALL THE TIME
B0079K4WEE|4.0|Imagine losing your senses one by one, how terrifying it would be, and the repercussions of not having the sense of smell, taste, hearing, and sight.  That is the epidemic depicted in this existential horror/dystopian film, where many, if not all, people in the world are afflicted.  We focus on the relationship between an epidemiologist and a chef who are both infected and go through the rigors of the illness with each other.  There is no explanation of what causes the problem, which adds to the tension.
0756404746|5.0|I saw this book on a list of great Sci-fi / fantasy reads last year and added to my wish list.  I am more then 2/3 of thw way through the book and I am having trouble putting it down to get some sleep.

B003E6K1VK|4.0|I have had time with this dac for a little while now, and I have tested a bunch of different headphones ~none that are high fidelity~ and I have not found a difference in the sound quality, whether the headphones are plugged straight into the source or if they are running through this dac. I am mainly using the [[ASIN:B005ZNHDYS Klipsch Reference ONE Premium On-Ear Earphones with Mic and Apple Control (Black)]], which are much like the Image One if anyone has them, but these have a much bigger soundstage and sound a bit clearer. This amp does NOT make a difference with these headphones! I don't understand why... Is it because these headphones have already simply reached their sound quality limit? I am no audiophile, but I know what to look for in headphones. To me, the sound coming from the dac is not forward at all, very neutral, and just as revealing as the headphones directly plugged in. The amp, after turned up to more than half volume (30), I can hear crackling as well. Besides those things, I rated this product 4 stars, even though it doesn't work for me, because I don't want to give it a bad review because I know this is only my problem or my headphones problem, and the dac its self is very well built and comes with a lot of extra things (carrying pouch, replaceable screen, etc.) I am probably going to return this dac only because I don't see any reason to use it if I can't hear a difference in the sound.
B003XT60KO|5.0|Very clearly written with a minimum of jargon.  Basic principles easy to understand even for the non-economist, but topics were not oversimplified.  Essential reading for anyone who wants to make informed decisions in these troubled economic times.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I was completely drawn into the first book. I anticipated  a thrill ride in book two. I was a quite dissapointed. It needs more plot. The sex scenes were wonderful but just too often. The constant concern for how each other was feeling was also a bit exhausting. Too much wonder and to much discussion about the same thing over and over..<br />I wanted more twists and turns. I wanted to be blown away.  I am currently half way through with the final book and find myself scanning through the sex scenes. Been there, done that over and over and over. BUT, I can't stop... I hope that some unexpected twists will happen shortly.. ( That is what has kept me interested...lol)<br />It just felt very redundant. BUT, I have read worse. I did buy all three so ....
B0054JZC6E|1.0|this game really sucks. I just wanted to play a simple game and thought this would cure my boredum but its just frustrating. between the ads and gaining the points and cutting out. this app is no longer on my kindle fire.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a very addicting game. Many people have wanted this game and now they've got it. very popular game. fun. Ive been playing for hours 5 stars.

I have a kindle fire and this app is amazing on the device. the picture, sound,instructions, and basically the entire game is well thought out and can keep u entertained for hours. thanks for reading<br />  sincerely crippled3
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for this to come out!!!!! I'm so glad it did... if you have any doubts get the app.

B0086700CM|5.0|This My Fav Game Like I Don't Even Know How To Explain It BUT You Should Buy It .#DEAD UP .
B00846REIS|4.0|Two observations:<br /><br />Yes, it's very similar to 50 Shades. But it's better in that there's no manufactured \\"danger\\" to the heroine of the type that dragged down all three 50 Shades books.<br /><br />I hope the multi-book story arc isn't the wave of the future. The characters are endearing, but not complex enough to warrant more than one book. Drawing it out feels like a money grab.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is cool. the reason why is because it is super addicting. you are sure to die in this endless run of fun because ofcourse it is endless. jump, run,and slide. collect coins and spend them on things at the store. over all I would say this is a great game that I would recomend for everyone

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't review many books, simply because I don't find myself with enough time to devour literature like many of my fellow Amazon Kindle readers. I generally feel that my take on a book may to too simple or naive to really give great advice or critique. Wool is different. No doubt about it, this is a fantastic collection of writing that I can't wait to read again in the future. One of the best things I've read in a few years. Hats off to Hugh Howey. Don't waste another second and go read Wool.
B0086700CM|5.0|i have had this game on my iPod forever. i have been waiting so long for this game to come onto the kindle.
B0086700CM|5.0|I got this game on 1mobile.com but now I see that about a day later this game showed up. I am still happy it came out but I wish it would have came out earlier.Still satisfied. Rate 5 stars.
B0086700CM|5.0|I played the game the other day on some one else's phone and I have since downloaded it to my kindle n I can't stop playing it! I have reached over 120,000 I am shooting for 200,000!!! soon!
145162445X|5.0|The content of the book is explained in a simple way that even someone who is not a scientist can understand. It is a bit deep, but it's a fairly easy read and well worth it. The overview of this topic is eye-opening and mind-blowing.
B005LAIHGI|1.0|I really enjoy Sacha Baron Cohen and think he is a talented actor. Borat was offensive, but terribly funny and that is what I thought I would get from this movie as well. I rarely ever go to the theater anymore because of costly prices, and let me say I wish I would have waited for the rental. The storyline could have been so much better,as this movie left me frowning more than it did laughing. To me it was dull and slow moving. My advice? Don't waste your time, but if you must save your money and rent it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|i loved all three books.  i didnt want the story to end.  i also enjoyed talking daily to people at work to compare notes about the books.  i haven't met anyone who has disliked the books.  i would recommend them to everyone who enjoys romance novels.  I especially enjoyed the emails that went back and forth between Mr. Grey and Ms. Steele they often made me laugh out loud.
0330477587|3.0|I ordered this book for a book club read, and when I ordered it, the order showed it was being shipped from NY.  It took over two weeks to arrive and the packaging revealed that it actually came from UK.  Now I won't finish the book in time for book club review. I'm disappointed that the order was misleading, makes me leary of ordering again.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and the story. The premise is very engaging and the characters are interesting as well. It is one of those books I just kept reading so I could figure out what was going to happen next.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|When I purchased this it was right after I received my kindle fire for my birthday. It turned out it wasn't what I wanted so when I got something else I gave the sleeve to my grandson who has a kindle and he is glad to have it so the purchase wasn't wasted.

B0060AY6FO|4.0|For those of us who are Austin fans, and what woman is not, this is a treat. Baroness James has even picked out some juicy tidbits from the original novel and salted these bits into the story. Unfortunately, the \\"mystery\\" part of the story left something to be desired. Lizzie was not really involved in determining the solution.  As imaginative as Lost in Austin [[ASIN:B001PJRAUS Lost in Austen]], Death Comes to Pemberley suffers from the same deficiency. As emphasized in Pride and Prejudice and the ingenious Lost In Austin, young ladies had to behave in very proscribed ways. Coming into modern times in Lost in Austin, sets Lizzie free and reluctant to return to her era. Without spoiling the ending of Death Comes to Pemberley, suffice it to say, if you know anything about the time in which it was written, despoiled young women, were not suitable for marriage. Finally, having said that, take Death Comes to Pemberley to the beach or on a plane.  The time will pass quickly.  It's great to have any P D James with which to pass the time.
B007VYBFA2|5.0|This is an awesome feature!  Love having the new shows ready and waiting! We will definitely used Amazon again for movies and TV shows.
0345803485|2.0|This is NOT racy. This is something that might be expected from a 19 year old who has been dabbling with their sexuality. If you're sex-starved, this will probably appeal to you. If you have a good sex life, this will bore you early on. Sorry, I hate to be so negative about it, but I don't see what the big deal about it is.
B0086700CM|5.0|Addictive would be a mild way of describing this game! As frustrating as this game can get, I find myself right back on it trying to get one more objective!
B004JMSIRC|4.0|I really did not think that I would like this movie. It appeared, from the previews to be pro-war, and frankly, this turned me off. The content, however, was anything but what I assumed. I do have some gripes about the amalgamation of stereotypes though. Admittedly, the Arabic was spoken nice and slowly, and was relatively keeping with what the translations said. Still, I don't expect much from Hollywood when it comes to not perpetuating negative stereotypes.

It is very well written, gripping, and you fall in love with Katsa from the very beginning! I read Fire as soon as I finished this one and I am about to start Bitterblue! If you're a fan of fantasy then I say definitely give it a try!

B004LWZW8S|4.0|most of you would expect.  Minus one star for shallow character development and the brownish yellow tint.  I hope movie studios are actively looking for ways to apply CGI with a more natural color palette.  I actually hope there is a sequel with all the gods fighting to save mankind from slaughter.
B0053YGYO4|2.0|After listening on-line for weeks and weeks to several of the songs on this release it seems to me (and my young daughters) that a few of the songs sound 'slower' than the videos and have a low hum that goes through Paradise.  Any thoughts on why this would be??? We use it both in our home and car stereos.  Just wanting to know for sure that this copy is authentic.....
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|This is such a helpful app. However- I prefer an alphabetic listing- not one by date.<br />I particularly appreciate that it stores info.<br />So-if you have to change devices you don't have to start all over again.
145162445X|5.0|Lawrence Krauss explains how a universe could arise from 'nothing' and does so beautifully!  I've also seen the lecture he gave, and it was truly awe inspiring.  If you can come into this with a truly open mind and process the information he gives you, you will come away with a deeper and greater understanding and appreciation for the universe we live in and all the things science has done to make sense of it.  I would recommend this book to anyone, it is outstanding!

1933952806|4.0|Mastering the Nikon D7000 is written in a folksy, conversational style that most will enjoy but some may find will-you-get-to-the-point frustrating. I just became acccustomed to it, and was rewarded with a clear & comprehensive walk-through guide to a great camera that, like the game of chess, can be learned in 10 minutes but takes many hours to master. You can read it cover-to-cover or jump around, either way the book is meant to be used with your D7000 in hand. Like the author, I have been shooting first film then digital for a long time, and before reading this book was not aware of the vast capabilities of the D7000. The instruction manual that comes with the camera is pretty dry reading and sometimes less than clear, especially about why change the presets and what you can accomplish. If you are serious about getting the most out of your D7000, reading this book will be time well spent.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|amazing :) this is a really fun app and imam slightly addicted to it lol. I hope others like it too.

B0073PPKNM|5.0|I would expect this distracting popping/cracking if it was an uncared for vinyl album, but this is throughout the song as an obvious defect, not in tempo with any of the music.  You can even hear it with the sample clip playing.<br /><br />That's garbage to release an album with such a cheap sounding artifact.  Otherwise I have enjoyed the past two albums from Melody.<br /><br />OK, I am adding an update...and I am sure others will have the same concern because it is not in tempo with the music, only on the one track, and no mention of it in the product liner.  I had my box outside in the mailbox to return the CD for refund, when after emailing Melody Gardot at her website (in case she did not know about it), and she was gracious enough to reply.  As a result, I have changed my rating from 2 stars to 5 stars, and grabbed the return box to Amazon before the Postman arrived.  Here was her gracious response, that I am only posting so others having the same concern will have a way to take this into account.<br /><br />=================================================================================<br /><br />Hello Charles! Im sorry you find this a defect but this is in fact not an error!<br /><br />The sound you hear is a small click from the nails -  as it has the sound of an old vinyl.<br />If you could picture the sound, its a small musician sitting beside the group, contributing to the song with only his hands, a smile, and the click of his finger nails. Some of the greatest  musician I have ever met have lived on the streets and while being very poor, make sounds with their mouths, their hands, essentially only what they have before them: their bodies. In this way it is an homage to the absence of any instrument beyond the human body. This is also a focus on the nature of microtones (the tiniest sounds!)<br /><br />I hope the image your mind can create can reharness the beauty you have in your mind while listening to the album.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br /><br />xx<br />Mme
B0016CJNS6|5.0|Nothing new to say here; for once I agree with the mainstream.  They taught suburbanites to appreciate the blues in the early 60's, but they unleashed the best rock and roll on BB, Let it Bleed and Sticky Fingers (then went downhill).
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I rated this book a 3 star because it was better than I expected and I do plan to read the other books.  However, as other reviewers have pointed out, the writing is poor.  I am very surprised that this book is a bestseller.  There are phrases the author uses over and over that get old and are a bit cheesy (can the female say holy **** any more in this book!).  It is a little hard to get past and at times I do roll my eyes (another common phrase used throughout the book, too).  If you can get past this, the book is enjoyable because it was more than just an erotic/sex novel - there actually is some substance to the story which I found intriguing and made me want to read the other books.  And, the book is pretty hot.  I wanted to read this just to see what the hype was about and while I agree with everyone else who says it is poorly written, if you can get past that, it is a pretty hot book with an decent story line.
0307951529|5.0|... from the cubicle nation, starting your day to the shrill sound of an alarm clock, commuting in traffic, having others control your time and dictating what your income will be, then The $100 Startup: Reinvent the Way You Make a Living, Do What You Love, and Create a New Future by Chris Guillebeau, is for you.<br /><br />More than 1,500 entrepreneurial start ups were considered for inclusion in the book. They had to meet the following criteria:<br />1. They had to make at least $50,000 per year from their business.<br />2. The business had to be started on a very low budget. The average starting investment was about $600.<br />3. Be willing to open up the books on their financial data and demographics for analysis.<br /><br />Chris interviewed over 100 people who broke away from the norm to create their own businesses and control their own destinies. He studied over 4,000 pages of data and surveys, and made hundreds of calls. In the end he created an actionable blueprint you can follow to create your very own startup.<br /><br />The book has a definite motivational aspect to it, but also cuts right to the chase and gives you the information, tools and a clear path to follow to get started including: The One-Page Business Plan (a copy of which is available for free at 100Startup.com), Six Steps To Get Started Right Now; the Idea Matrix to evaluate the impact, effort, profitability, and vision of your business ideas; and The Action Bias is about focusing on the right thing, to help your startup succeed.<br /><br />If you've ever thought or dreamed of creating your own business, The $100 Startup clearly shows you it is possible. It's more than just a business book; it's your blueprint to personal freedom.<br /><br />Get the book and make your dream a reality.
B004KRQFI0|5.0|It doesn't matter if you like techno, dub step, rap, heavy metal, you should listen to this album.  You will either hate it or love it but nothing in between because it is a truly amazing album a work of art.<br /><br />It doesn't matter if you like dub step or not in fact I don't really think this is dub step its so much more and it is so unique.<br /><br />LOVE IT
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for this to come out for forever!<br />I played it on my cousin's iPod and loved it, now I can play it anytime that I want! It's a really fun game!
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|This book, Man's Search for Meaning, is very physically and emotionally descriptive about Victor Frankl's life in the concentration camps during Hitler's regime.  It is also very descriptive of what could keep a person psychologically going in the most hopeless, oppressed and physically deprived situations.  And even come out of it alive.<br /><br />The second part describes psychological life after survival, how to cope with the loss of everything known and loved previously and how to start life again and make it meaningful.  Discussions of a new psychiatric method compared to older methods shows how to help people accomplish living more confortably in their skin after the painful remembrances of concentration camp life and life in general.<br /><br />Amazing what a person can endure and come out of it living a meaningful life and helping others do the same.

B00785P2QC|5.0|Both my husband and I found this game and now we can't stop playing...we love it!  Thank you G5 for an awesome game!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is sooo much fun. I love how you can have different characters. plus you can buy power ups I would get this game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's a very fun game for just killing time or seeing who can get the highest score out of you and your friends.
B0086700CM|5.0|it took a while for it to come out but once it did I was right on it. its addicting.. its majorly fun!  cant put it down!
145162445X|5.0|Loved this book. Lawrence eloquently lays out the case with supporting evidence that nothing is not really what we think it is. Oh, and the butthurt religious people might actually try reading the book before giving it a bad review.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very enjoyable. nice updates. good variety of games nicely addictive.  good levels. not too hard to get points. a game I would recommend to others.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|Our Bushnell V2 Standard Edition Golf Laser Rangefinder is precise and easy to use. It responds quickly and is helpful, especially when close to the greens. A gem on the golf course!
B0085YAGMA|5.0|This movie is so funny and it takes place in during one of the saddest days in a person's life... burying a parent.  I know that Chris Rock & Co. remade this but I just couldn't bear to watch the new one when this one was just perfect in its execution and delivery.<br /><br />British humor (or humour):) abounds in this movie. It is one of my favorites when it comes to Comedy Noir and I recommend it to everyone I know who has a sense of humor like mine!<br /><br />Matt MacFadyen and Keeley Hawes are perfect in this, as is Peter Dinklage and the entire rest of the cast. Alan Tudyk stole the scenes he was in and Daisy Donovan was just wonderful.<br /><br />I have already purchased a DVD copy and dropped it onto my server for replay at any time.<br /><br />Watch this version and make up your own mind.
0345522303|4.0|The war between the Plenimarians and Rhiminee continues in Mycena with the former's Overlord asks for a parlay for peace but the latter's Queen Phoria refuses to negotiate in spite the hostilities going bad for her kingdom.  Meanwhile Watchers espionage operatives Alec and Seregil informs their chief Thero the wizard that they plan to visit the summer home of the Duke Reltheus for a client needing the services of Rhiminee Cat burglar to steal letters before the rat's ex-mistress marries.  They succeed in obtaining the love letters but also find an incriminating note, which Reltheus should not have, that incriminates Princess Klia of sedition against the Queen.<br /><br />At the same time, a plague has struck the overcrowded Rhiminee filled with refugees from the war as well as the local residents.  As the death count mounts, an already anxious city feels fear and panic, while some members of the Royal Court conspire to further their personal objectives.<br /><br />The sixth Nightrunner military-political fantasy (see The White Road and Shadow's Return) is an engaging  thriller that keeps The Traveling Twosome (aside - great show) close to home with the only distant scenarios involving Commander Beka Cavish leading the Royal forces against the Plenimarians.  The storyline starts a bit slowly as the protagonists and others attend the theater, but the plot accelerates when the thieves break into the Duke's home and never slows down from there even with some repetitious activity.  Well written and exciting, fans of the series will want know whether the Princess plots against the Queen.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B002361MLA|5.0|This book has helped change my outlook on life. It has helped me to step outside and view myself in a whole new light.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really enjoy this app. The games are fun and the soundtrack is relaxing. Definitely  won't be bored with this one.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|If you're a fan of nonograms this is a great app. And if you're not, or at least not yet, it has a very nice and quick tutorial that explains how to play. The only problem is that the difficultly probably rises too fast for new players, so if you're not experienced expect to bang your head your head against your screen for a while.
B0086700CM|5.0|took long enough!(:<br /><br />notice 99% of reviews are about how great it is!<br /><br />im so excited now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ahh h h h h!  (:
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game,  I do,  but it can be boring to others. this ap works well,  but once you complete your goals this game is going to be boring. I like the idea though,  and the objectives are challenging. All I have to do now is resurrect twice. my family doesn't find this game too appealing though, but its all a matter of opinion.
B0086700CM|5.0|yes I am so glad this has come out now been waiting for such a long time!!! I am so happy!
B001VLXNLU|1.0|If any of you have read the fanfiction My Immortal, this book will seem very familiar. Zoey is supremely gifted. she is the only fledgling with a filled in mark, the only fledgling OR vampyre with an expanded mark on her back and shoulders, the only vampyre to have an affinity for all 5 elements, the only blah blah blah. I think we get it. The concept is unique but the actual story reads like a 13 year olds fantasy. Don't buy unless you are 13.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is the best game I bought! Everyone should get this app to burn down time! Nest game I have on kindle!!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Does everything the description says it does. Looks good on the Kindle, and its free.  A good &quot;addition '&quot; to any app library.
B0086700CM|5.0|My brothers are begging me to let them play it. It is so fun and addicting.  I don't know why Im not playing it now!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Best Bible app! When I read it I feel close to God and Jesus. Our family reads it every night and love it! You must get it! God is awesome!
B007SGM084|5.0|I don't like to read and I had this trilogy completely read in a week!  I had no idea what I was getting myself into but so glad I got them.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|A great series of books.  Each book gets better and deeper into the story. Different from any other story I've read.
0439023521|5.0|I read this book in a day and a half.  I carried it everywhere I went, hardly ever put it down.  It was one of those.... Need book 2!!
B0086700CM|5.0|some people are complaining that it's not responsive enough, but all u have to do is turn up the sensitivity on the options.<br /><br />it's pretty darn fun and takes a game or two to get used to.  don't expect to get very far without unlocking some powerups first.<br /><br />also be aware that items are bought with the slightest tap in the store so be wary.  I bought some stuff on accident cause of that
B005EGXTHG|4.0|Saw the advertisements for The Hunger Games movie and found the story concept intriguing.  Bought The Hunger Games book at an airport as my flight was delayed, began reading and was immediately absorbed in the story.  Then went on line to purchase the rest of the trilogy and found them to be equally absorbing, basically put everything aside until I'd read them through.  Only issue with Kindle is you can't share the stories like you can with a book.
B003Y7L5W8|4.0|When I first heard of a new OMD album in 2010, I immediately trembled with excitement, being quite a long-time OMD fan. I read some stuff, listened to the quick listen function on Amazon and bought the album. I was pleased quite immediately and find this a real successful come-back, one of their best albums in years (Andy and Paul even call it their best album since Architecture&Morality).<br /><br />For me, History of Modern is a good return to old relevance and form. OMD are revisiting their past while also taking into account current musical trends and production techniques. I find this album pretty fine and a pleasing listening experience for the most part, albeit not as musically cohesive and brilliant from beginning to end as Architecture&Morality (hence only four stars instead of five).<br /><br />I won't give a detailed song-by-song run-down (that's already been done greatly by rockgirl). My personal highlights here are \\"History of Modern part I+II\\", \\"New Holy Ground\\" and \\"Sister Marie Says\\", all of which contain the ingredients of a brilliant OMD song: catchy synth hooks, great musical arrangements and Andy's deeply reflective lyrics (either positive/hopeful or sad/wistful, but always heartfelt and sincere). Especially \\"New Holy Ground\\" (my favourite by a small margin) moves me which its perfect OMD minimalism, featuring some sensual female footsteps, beautiful synth string/mellotron arrangement and Andy's deeply emotive lyrics (sad and forward-looking at the same time).<br /><br />The other tracks I find not that great, but there are more little gems interspersed, like the distantly New Order-ish \\"New Baby: New Toys\\", the lovely Kraftwerk tribute \\"RFWK\\", or the (lyrically) angst-ridden \\"Green\\".<br /><br />Apart from some minor disappointments (\\"Pulse\\", \\"Bondage of Fate\\"), I really find this a sufficiently good album and fine return to old songwriting greatness. It may not reach the heights of A&M or Dazzle Ships, but it's certainly as good as (if not better) than anything that came after Dazzle Ships.<br />Confidently recommended (at least for OMD fans).<br /><br />btw, the quick listen function on Amazon (e.g. via the Amazon Music Sampler) gives a good opportunity to obtain a first impression of a new musical product and should prevent you from all too disappointing album purchases.<br />When I used this quick listen function for OMD's HoM on Amazon, I was immediately moved by some tracks and ordered the album in no time. If I hadn't been convinced by the quick listen function on Amazon, I wouldn't have bought the album (HoM); simple as that.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Very intricate plot line with great twists. rusty work with first person narrative and grammar mistakes that improve over time
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This Game is awesome I really like it I wonder if you like it hope you enjoy it and have lots of fun
B0086700CM|1.0|as soon as it started it crashed. just didn't respond. unistalling right away. btw I'm a kindle fire user. too bad I was looking forward to playing it after reading such flawless reviews.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|This movie is horrible, i spent over an hour full of language and wasted my time on this movie. Very disappointed !
B0086700CM|5.0|it is AMAZING and I love it there is so much ACTION and fun!!!! I NEVER get tired and I know I Qm having fun while playing it!!!
B0041VV03A|1.0|If you have any moral or values you won't like a few of the messed up adult scenes which ruins the movie. Just wrong.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is my most  favorite game out of all my games and I have like 20 games. this is eroo out
B007MU85D0|5.0|I first heard Little Talks on Sirius radio and fell in love with that song.  The entire album is very melodic folk/indie/pop with female/male lead singers that blend together perfectly.  Imagine Arcade Fire with Bjork as a lead singer with several other influences thrown in that I can't quite place yet.  There really isn't a weak song on the album but some of my favorites are Little Talks, Dirty Paws, Mountain Sound, From Finner and Love Love Love.  The album gets better with each listen.  I buy a lot of different kinds of music and I never write reviews but this album has blown me away.  It will probably be one of the best albums released all year.  Can't wait to hear what they do next. Highly recommended!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Now I can read on my Android phone while on road and the selection of free books are great.  Highly recommend.
145162445X|5.0|Awesome book. A highly recommended read.  Dr Tyson would be proud.  We need more books to expand the populations ever shrinking minds
0439023521|5.0|The first book in the Hunger Games trilogy, I think this one is the best. It's a fast-paced quick read full of adventure and suspense. I had hoped the movie would be as good as the book, but isn't the book always better anyway?
B0016Q2D5M|2.0|This movie..wow. The book by Verne was nice, and so was the beginning to this movie. I immediately got a horrible taste in my mouth when I saw them on this silly adventure in the railway cart. It was then that I knew that this movie was not a real adaption or a serious one but rather a spoof either intentional or not.<br /><br />Rather than going on about how much of a Disney movie it turned out to be with a good beginning, let me go over a few problems I had.<br /><br />1) When they were going out the water blast at the end, are you seriously telling me that they were perfectly aimed at the top to where they didn't clip the side and go tumbling up?<br />2) The kid stored a prehistoric bird in his bag and it didn't die of either cramped space or something similar? You hide a bird in the small pocket of a bag and you tell me what happens.<br />3) The graphics are worse than a movie made about 12 years before in Jurassic Park. Really?<br /><br />There are many more complaints. The 2 stars are for the beginning of the movie and the beautiful actress who, in real life, would NOT have fallen for the main character in such a short amount of time.<br /><br />Really, if you are a kid then maybe this movie might suffice. If you are an adult then no, this movie won't do. It feels rushed and we as viewers should demand better. How is it that Jurassic Park had better graphics than this movie? That just bites me in negative places..<br /><br />John McAdam: Author of<br />Enoch and the Extraterrestrials<br />Areoth<br />Westh: Sun Thieves (An Areoth adventure)
0061120081|5.0|I can't believe I hadn't read this book until now. Most people are assigned this book as high school reading, but I never was. Harper Lee's story is so sweet and is so worthy of all the accolaids it receives.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|Cross Me has some really difficult but fascinating puzzles. You must logically deduce which squares on the board should be black, revealing a picture. Sufficiently challenging for long term play. The app works fine. For the person who said it needs zoom, pinch to zoom works.
B0086700CM|5.0|I am so addicted to this game I get so into it when I'm at home sitting on my couch. I have this on all of my devices and now I can finally play it on my kindle fire :D
0345803485|1.0|I agree with the negative reviews others have given this book. The character, Christian Grey, is self centered, controlling, and an abusive narcissist. Ana is an unbelievably innocent virgian who worships him for his good looks and status. Even  though she recognizes he is a control freak she disregards it and moves forward anyway. I read three chapters and couldnt continue. It's insane that this book is a bestseller! Why?  No young adult reader should ever read this book, and the mature adult will find this book poorly written with repetition and lack of depth.  It's a pathetic story, dont waste your money.
0345803485|1.0|I couldn't finish this book, much less get even half way. Awful writing, awful characters and a silly plot. I like chick lit light books as much as the next person but hated this! Cannot understand the hype!
B005HSL626|1.0|it is not good at all. I try and I try but I just can't win this game. I never win this game. so do not install.
B0086700CM|5.0|game rocks!!! you need to go into your setting tab and click on applications and close anything that is not needed to play the game. do this and you will have no lag.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My grandson has been playing it non stop since I bought it.  It teaches strategy while having fun, not too many games can boast this.
B0086700CM|4.0|difficult at first but fun after some practice. i like the jokes they put after you die. addicting. fun wat to pass time.
B0086700CM|2.0|i love temple run on my itouch but on the kindle fire it is extremely disopointing the the kindle fire itself and temple run are both laggy if it wasnt laggy then i would love it
B007PTJOV0|5.0|good game. its an Irish version of Mario!  I had fun playing this game on my kindle. it had good graphics. easy way to kill time. :)
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it it is the best game ever if you want a greater game then this is the one for you I am so glad It came out on the kindle fire I give this awesome game a 5 star review
0345803485|2.0|This one is a bit much for me. It reads like something a sex-starved teenager might write. Is this really a serious effort or is it satire?
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This is a good romance book with some hot scenes, though only a little hotter than the average romance.  I did enjoy the love story, however, at times I found the plot stretched a little.  Overall I would recommend this, but don't go into it expecting something very unique to the genre.
B0086700CM|5.0|omg! omg. I cant believe they finally have TEMPLE RUN. I am sooooo excited, I am literally jumping up and down. yayyyyyy soooo excited... :-) :-) :-)
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting so long for this app and now its here this is the best app in the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is that best of tablet games -- simplicity of play, while being challenging enough to encourage further play.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run it is the best app I have ever got I am pretty much addicted now I play it all the time
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so good I can not stop playing it. You must get it its just the Best game ever.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so much fun it is for kids all ages and you will want all day every day
B005HSG3TC|5.0|The case works great, lightweight yet durable. The stand is simple yet efficient. Easy to open and close and the strap holds it together when closed.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best game i have ever played i was waiting for it to come out on the kindle fire because all my friends had it on there ipods ... now its on the kindle way to go Imangi Studios!!!
0307956350|4.0|This novel is better than most bestselling action-adventure books out there,  even if the heroine is a wife and mother.  Kate, leaves her dark-ops  CIA career behind to move to Europe with her computer security expert husband and starts a new life of upscale ExPat wife caring for her two children.  Naturally complications arise when she finds she is being monitored, is it someone who knows about her CIA  missions?  She even begins to wonder if her husband is not what he seems.<br />  I was surprised this was writte n by a man,  it is more like a chick adventure with the female protagonist.  The reason I only gave it four stars is that there are too many flashbacks,  and flashbacks to prior flashbacks.  At times it is hard to place what happened, and in what order.  The other mildly irritating thing is that a former CIA operative should have been a whole lot more suspicious of the other agents  and even her husband.  But,  all in all,  excellent poolside reading.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is a very handy app. the numbers are very large and the calculator is very easy to use. I reccommend it for anyone who is farsighted.
0062082353|5.0|This is an awesome book I definitely recommend this.  It is amazing what Chris Kyle and everyone in the military has done for this country read this book.
B007PYFMZM|5.0|I love any show that portrays intelligence as one of the highest qualities of the human condition.  The cast is spot on brilliant.  The stereotypically awkward social interactions with \\"normal\\" people provide endless fodder for situational humor while the strong character development endears you to their plight.  Highly recommended.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run it is the best app in the whole United States of America!!!!!!!! My grandma and my aunt both have ipads and the game they play most often is temple run!!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app so much on the iphone, but now on the kindle, freakin awesome, the graphics are exactly the same, there are no screen glitches like you get with partial versions, this is the real deal.
B0086700CM|5.0|Really great app, very fun. Would be funner with a map maker, though. More chars terse and a different backdrop would be great.  I love it and play it every day.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for this app for the kindle fire!! now that they finally added it, my app collection is almost perfect!! :)
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I must say, that I enjoyed the story. I enjoyed reading and getting to know these characters. That being said, I did have some issues with the writing style. I can imagine this book being written by an 11th grade girl, who knows very little about what sex actually entails. The main characters, Christian and Ana, are obviously attracted to each other right off the bat. Right from the beginning, you can sense that Christian's character is a control freak, who always gets his way. Surprise, surprise, which man isn't a control freak? Aside from the lack of originality, there is one particular phrase that was overused. \\"I flush.\\" She does this a lot. Where in the world was the editor, to avoid such blatant redundancy? I will say, that the story line had a way of sucking me in. It was a fairly fast read for me, having finished the entire book in less than 4 hours, and not being able to put it down. Well, I hope that you enjoy reading my review, and that you will decide for yourself. I also will be picking up the rest of the trilogy, in order to see what happens to our promiscuous Anastasia, and our beloved, \\"Fifty shades of (insert obscenity here),  up\\", Christian.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|i like it however it needs a update... sooner than later.  clear graphics on the kindle fire.  it freezes sometimes though.
B0086700CM|5.0|I loved it.  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ! a m a z I n g ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
B0086700CM|5.0|I thought this game would be so stupid but I tried it and it was wonderful if you don't have this game you should so get it!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|Ive been waiting for this game to come for the Kindle Fire and it finally has!!!!!! This game is sooo addictive and fun!!!!! Love It!!!
B007X15GRQ|4.0|Good movie, but not quite what I was expecting.  Thought it would be more action less drama, but still a good movie.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is a really really fun game, and temple run is a really really fun game for every one.I play this game every day!
B0086700CM|5.0|finaly temple run is here hey sjould put more ipod games like tiny wings and call of duty stuff like that
B005ERIRZE|5.0|This is one of the rare books that I would say is a real game changer - and can truly help you make those changes you have been trying to make in your life.  Have you ever wondered why life is difficult; why things are so hard to achieve?  The answers are in this book.  And the author makes the work clear, concise, interesting, and best of all very practical.  It is one of the few books that surpassed my expectations. If you are ready to step it up and admit that life will get better when you work on your own discipline - then this is the book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm not a particular fan of science fiction.  I picked this up because I had heard lots of good things about it and I was curious (SPOILER:  Curiosity is not a good thing in this world).  I'm glad I did.  This was a very good read with many things to like.  I liked the focus on relatively few characters, unfolding both them and the world at appropriate points.  I liked its relative unpredictability.  I really got into the major battle scene featuring two groups who knew almost nothing about combat.  I liked the description of how the world in the silos is laid out and how it functions day-to-day.  I liked the rise in drama from each book's start to the end; it really kept me riveted.  I liked the breadth of age of the featured characters, from teens to elderly.  And I liked how the world is so massive and so interesting it could easily spawn 100 books, each one interesting but different.  The one thing I didn't like as much was Juliette, the main character of books 2-5 (either as described or in absentia).  Don't get me wrong, she's a great character, but she's got more than her share of lives.  I'm looking forward to more adventures from the silos and perhaps other adventures from Mr. Howey.
0920668364|5.0|What a valuable lesson for not only the young but also the old.  An inspiring book both will truly enjoy.
B0086700CM|5.0|why any bad reviews awesome game has a couple glitches but hey what's one messed up run everyone should get it because it is simple yet amazingly fun

0345803485|5.0|I love this book. I never stay up at night and read or anything.  However, this book had me glued to my kindle constantly!  This the best book I have read in years.  As soon as I finished this book, I logged onto Amazon and downloaded the second one.  I only stopped reading that night because my kindle battery dies :(.
B0086700CM|5.0|its an amazing game! I love running from the monkeys and getting coins its even good for liken4 andnup! its a great time passer.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app and love to play it. It is very addicting. Once you play it you don't want to stop.
B0086700CM|3.0|So I really like this game but I have been playing it and it is really delayed. it doesn't work like it does on the ipod.. im really disappointed because I have been really exited for this game to be on the kindle...:-(
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|Really enjoy playing and finally built up enough coins to  buy more colors. BUT I only got to use them once! After leaving the game to do other things on my Kindle then going back into the game, the new colors were gone and the coins I used to buy them were gone, too! If they offer colors to buy and expect you to use your coins,  then let us keep them forever! That's  why only 3 stars instead of 5.
B0086700CM|5.0|I &lt;3 this game!!!! this game finally came out cuz my friend has it on her ipod so I play it all the time so I just don't no what 2 say about the game. the only thing I have 2 say is if u like it I like it.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I was introduced to the Catan series of games through the Cities & Knights expansion. I instantly fell in love with the game, but hesitated to purchase my own because of the high price. I then thought of checking Amazon, and was pleasantly surprised to find it for so cheap! I bought this at the same time I bought a great card game called Bohnanza. I bought the main game, and the player expansion, for less than I would have paid for just the basic game at my local game store.<br /><br />The game is a fun boardgame style take on some of my favorite PC game series, such as Civilization and Age of Empires. The game does take a while to play, so needs to be started early in the day if you want to get one, or more, rounds in. The gameplay and rules can be a bit overwhelming for a first-time player; however you are able to gain a strong grasp on the \\"how-to\\" once you start playing. This game is not for the whole family (if you have younger children), as younger children may have a difficult time grasping the concept of play and applying strategy. This is a great game to play/introduce to families with older children, friends, or colleages on game nights or at parties/get-togethers.
B0086700CM|3.0|I would give this app 5 stars! I love it a lot and I am happy that ammozon finally got the app!! but there is a problem it always freezes!! when I jump I die just because it freezes!! please fix it!!:(
B002MQYOFW|5.0|beyond amazing ! most people discard the topic becaue its kids killing other kids, no its much more. its about a government controlling everything. i couldnt stop reading this. i read it in a day! it was extraordinary full of love romance and action
0439023513|5.0|it was amazing i loved it my teacher is litterly crazy about the trilogy so i decided to read the seris. know i know why the movie for the frist one was good to
B007V2UGPE|1.0|I have the HTC One X, which doesn't have an external sd card, only the internal. When I click to install, it says SD card required.
B005NPBT5M|1.0|The Wall is an absolute classic. Brilliant. But as far as the remastering goes, they still haven't got it right. In a time when music can be remastered to where it sounds like the band is playing live in your living room, not everyone incorporates this available technology in the remastering process. The Beatles remasters are stunning. Depeche Mode remasters on DVD are perhaps the best of all remastering projects I've ever heard, The Cure did a fine job, U2 eh okay could've been better... and Pink Floyd - eh could've been better, and The Wall stands out as most disappointing. \\"In The Flesh?\\" should kick off like it's going to tear down your living room walls by its sheer intensity. Instead, it sounds slightly better than the mid-1990's remaster. Skip this if you already own it. It's not worth re-buying just for an ever so slightly better sound.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so fun. I love this game. lots of fast paced stress relief. I recommend this highly to anyone who wants a simple faced paced game.
B0086700CM|5.0|finally the game game came out for the kindle fire and I'm so glad I felt left out having kindle fire because games like this always come out late
0316069884|5.0|Every thing is just like OK and I wish to reach the minimum amount of words that are necessary to post a review, since I was asked to do so by e-mail. Also, I would like not to do any mistakes as I am a foreign reader.
B007X16GFC|5.0|This was a really good action movie. Highly recommend this movie. Rental fee kind of high, but obviously worth paying when you are to lazy to run up to the corner rental place. :-)
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome! but 1 problem it sorta lags wen u get faster.dosnt matter because I already unloked 2 people
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This is a great book if you are not looking for it to be the same as the movie version. I typically read books that have movies made for them becasue I love to be able to see how my vision of the book relates to the movie. However, when the movie is totally different it doesn't really matter. Don't get me wrong seperate both the movie and the book are great. The movie is just not completely based on the book in regards to how the book plays out.
0307341550|3.0|I read this book in two days.  It's definitely a classic page turner, but by 3/4 through, I was rolling my eyes and wondering why I had gotten myself so invested.  The plot is very weak and gets continually weaker as the novel proceeds.  And the characters are all caricatures (save Camille, who is somewhat interesting in a Lisbeth Salenger kind of way)....but the montruous mother, 13 (!) year old sister who is wise and evil beyond her years made the book like high camp, which I don't think was the intent.  I expected more from reading the reviews.....  Kind of disappointed.
B007NCSQFO|5.0|a good cd to jam to also relating to some songs, a little different from the first one, especially doing some pop/dance songs, not really expecting it from her, but then again she does do her stuff her own way ands makes it awesome
B000L53D4O|1.0|This toy is dangerous for babies!  My grandson was pushing it and the handle fell off.  He would have fallen had I not been following along with him! Fisher-Price used to mean quality! I would NOT recommend this at all!  Shame on you Fisher-Price!
B006MVJ2L4|4.0|Adam Lambert's first album was eclectic and uneven. Clearly, he was trying to mine all his musical inspirations at once, and the tracks alternately shined and fell flat. \\"Trespassing\\" is a much more sleek and coherent effort - a straight up dance/pop album for 2012.<br /><br />The album follows the familiar pop format of the first brunt of the album being made up of upbeat tracks, with the midtempo tracks and ballads saved for the end (see every Janet Jackson album ever for this formula). In the case of \\"Trespassing\\" it works just fine, mostly because Adam rips through high energy dance songs and emotional ballads with equal aplomb. Adam has technically impressive and (more importantly) emotionally expressive pipes, and he's got charisma and personality to spare. In short, he's a true singing star.<br /><br />On the album's opening title track, \\"Trespassing,\\" he owns his situation - he's an out and proud gay man who wants to be a mainstream pop star. And he wants to do it on his own terms. Some people might not like it (hence the trespassing metaphor) but he doesn't give a damn. \\"I shine when I wanna shine,\\" he asserts.<br /><br />Following this manifesto, Adam then goes on with the business of being a pop star, making electric songs about letting loose and partying (\\"Cuckoo\\", \\"Pop That Lock\\") sex (\\"Naked Love\\") and love gone wrong (\\"Chokehold\\", \\"Broken English\\"). Along the way, Adam stops a few times to go a little deeper, letting people know there's more to him than meets the eye on \\"Underneath\\", and soberly describing the GLBT experience on \\"Outlaws of Love\\". Lately, it seems like songs about GLBT people have mostly come from straight, female pop singers (\\"Born This Way\\", \\"Firework\\", et al) but when an actual gay person sings about it, boy does it resonate much more. \\"Everywhere we go/We're lookin' for the sun/Nowhere to grow old/We're always on the run\\" he sings soberly, tenderly, and with restraint.
B0086700CM|5.0|Yay im happy tht I can get it on my kindle fire now :) bzusbzhgz Hz sj. oz. I. Xi. ix
B004HW7JMY|5.0|usually prequels are just time fillers, but this one is pretty good. The story is well written and i like seeing the backgrounds of some of the characters and why they were who they were. very interesting.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Out of the hundreds of books I have read over my lifetime, Beautiful Disaster is hands down in my top 10.  I think we all can relate on some level to a relationship that is not always healthy at all times but you just can't walk away. Beautifully written and I just could not put this one down.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|What annoyed me the most about this book? Was it the \\"holy crap\\" in practically every sentence, or the \\"foil packet\\" or calling each other Miss and Mr? Is it Christian's gray eyes over and over, or his obsession with food - who cares? Is it the boring sex they have 24/7...oh wait, (spoiler) he does spank her a couple of times...whoopie. We get it - he's a freak, she's a fool - or is it the other way around? Doesn't really matter because two thirds of the way into the book you'll be so bored that you can think up your own adjectives. I am happy that the author has had enormous success - more power to her, but seriously, read The Story of O if you want true erotica that's well written.
6305428050|5.0|I always like this move and I wanted my children to see it.  I receive fast post service.  I hope I can find something else with them. thanks for doing bussise with me.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is pure S&M porn and shows the declining intelligence of women in America.  Along with reality shows, talk shows(celebs promoting whatever), food and fashion networks, the dumbing down of women is sad to see. Along with crumbling morals and values, this is right at the top of women digressing into mindlessness.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is simply amazing, it keeps you entertained. I just love it. FINALLY its available on the Kindle Fire, I was starting to think it would never be on the Kindle!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game it is so addicting. I play every chance I get. love this app. get it now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B0001FR3IQ|3.0|This movie has alot going for it good atmospher, story, characters except the ending it was a bit far fetched not storyline wise but visually it questions ones integrity or common sence other wise good movie if you can get past the ending, I will always tell it like I see it.<br />Scott M
0345803485|5.0|I am not going to give the story away in this review.  I absolutely loved this book! I don't like everything about how the Author writes, but the story I love. I think it's safe to say that Ana has a \\"Happy Period\\" ! hmmmph! *smile*
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This book had so much awesome I nearly had a panic attack once I finished it, as well as several times while reading it. Seriously. SO GOOD
B0081KTI0E|4.0|I'll admit I watched this movie to see how Daniel would perform. He was very believable in character.  The movie is your typical \\"period\\" supernatural thriller. I enjoyed it, as it was very well acted and the plot kept my attention.
B007FH9GT2|1.0|As a huge fan of the Swedish version of this film and its sequels, I was reluctant to watch the American version.  I'm cynical about the business side of American entertainment and saw this as a common move to cash in on a proven product.  On the other hand, I have seen the Swedish trilogy several times and read the books, so I was curious about this version. That said, on the recommendation of my son, who is a film aficionado and enjoys Fincher's work, I decided to stream it from Amazon.  I knew I might be in trouble from the opening credits, which were flowing CGI objects moving to a Led Zeppelin song--I should say at this point that in general the music was totally inappropriate throughout the entire film.  My overall impression--and I did stick it out to the end--was that the screenwriters took the original screen play and went through it with a highlighter identifying the sections to keep, while deleting the enriching detail, the nuance, the story telling and character building that made the Swedish version so amazing.  This movie was so THIN that if I hadn't been  familiar with the story, I would have been lost.  Deep narrative arcs and links to the the overall story were replaced with 2 minutes of explanatory hand-holding  We are never asked to think, to immerse ourselves into the characters in order to understand their emotions, and thus why they are doing what they are doing--other than the most obvious.  The audience is assumed to need clearly enunciated bullet lists of events and a timeline to understand past events--at least that's how we are treated.  Imagine \\"Mad Men\\", \\"Downton Abbey\\" or \\"Game of Thrones\\" told in 12 minute episodes with conveniently placed charts and photos and you may get my meaning.  And finally it was so emotionally empty that there was really no reason why any of the characters should connect to each other--i.e. two dimensional figures have a hard time connecting in a 4 dimensional world.  None of the relationships seem REAL because the characters don't spend enough time on-screen together--the breadth of familial corruption and evil isn't developed, the depth of frustration and loss that Henrik must have felt isn't portrayed, the long standing bond between Blomkvist and Erika, and the motivation for the temporary bond between Lisbeth and Kalle.  So there you are--another American film where celebrities land big roles, get a lot of press in the entertainment media (to its financial gain too) and basically walk through the role.  If you haven't seed the Sweedish versions, do so, and then as an experiment, watch this one.  And now that I've written this review, I realize how much I disliked this movie, and how truly bad it actually was.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book was a waste of 150 pages of my time.That was about all I could take. Ana needs a therapist.I think I  would rather go out with Hannibal Lecther,  you would'nt have to sign a contract. I wish I'd read some reviews prior to reading.Bad, over hyped and poorly written.Sorry to be so negative, but seriously? I,m shocked at the hype.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|What a fun, challenging game! I had never heard of these type of puzzles before and now I am addicted!
B0086700CM|5.0|it was really fun and recommend it to all ages. better than angry birds. if you don't get it your missing out.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is GREAT! And its very entertaining!!! I love it . I play it everyday! I'm glad that it has been released on the kindle
